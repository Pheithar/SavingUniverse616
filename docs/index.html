                    <p class="about__description">
                        Welcome to Earth-616, one of the many Marvel Universes. To accommodate for multiple storylines and avoid conflicts in the stories, i.e. in one story, Spiderman is the hero and suddenly turns into a villain, Marvel decided in an early stage to introduce the multiverse. In all of its essence, The Multiverse is multiple timelines for the marvel characters. You might remember Spiderpig (actually Spider-Ham or Peter Porker), an augmentation of Spiderman where he is a pig. This is, in fact, canon in the marvel universe and happened on Earth-8311. To distinguish between the universes, marvel uses an index system in the Earth-#Number syntax. The central universe is Earth-616, which we explored in this project.

                    <p class="about__description">
                        This project works with three data sets: The characters, the characters' quotes and the teams each character is a part of.  All data is retrieved from the <a target="_blank" href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Database" class="dataset__link">Marvel Fandom Wiki</a>. After preprocessing the data sets, we are left with two: The characters and the teams. 
                        <br>  
                        The key attributes of the data set consist of the name of the characters, the alter egos, the links to other characters, which teams they are allied to and the quotes from the characters.
                        <br>
                        The quotes from the characters will be used for text analysis. Here we will first look at the general words of the teams with the most text.  Lastly, we will create a network consisting of all the characters and see how that looks.
                        <br>
                        As some might be interested in the characters in the data set, how many teams they are a part of, whether they are positive or negative, or other small stats, we have implemented a search function for the characters at the bottom of the page.
