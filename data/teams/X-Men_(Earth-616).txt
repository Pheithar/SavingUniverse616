| Overview                = The '''X-Men''' are a team created by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]] as a response to the emergence of naturally occurring super-humans known as [[Homo superior|mutants]] among the baseline [[Homo sapiens|human]] society. Seeking to promote his dream of peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans, Xavier trained his X-Men in the use of their powers at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], training them to become defenders of a world that hates and fears them. Over the years, the heroes of mutantkind found their mission constantly endangered by both reactionary humans and fanatic mutants.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Men Vol 1 8|8]]}}

| HistoryText             = <center>''This is an abridged version of The X-Men's history. For a complete history see '''[[X-Men (Earth-616)/Expanded History|The X-Men's Expanded History]]'''''</center>

===Origin===
The result of a leap in natural evolution, [[Homo superior|mutants]], or ''Homo superior'', are born with superhuman abilities which generally manifest themselves at puberty. Seen as a threat, mutants are often hated and feared by other humans. Spending most of his early adult years studying mutation at [[Oxford University]], [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|'''Professor Charles Xavier''']], who himself was secretly a mutant [[telepath]], had a dream of mutants and humans coexisting pacifically. During his period at Oxford, Xavier found in the brilliant geneticist [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira Kinross]] a trusted colleague with whom he shared his ideals and plans.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 389}}{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Charles Xavier (Earth-616) from Powers of X Vol 1 6 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Charles Xavier has a dream]]
Over the years, Xavier realized that other mutants envisioned different futures for mutantkind than  his own dream of co-existence. In [[Israel]], he met a mutant named [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magnus]], whose views differed radically from Xavier's dream. Mangus believed that a war between mutants and humans for dominance of the Earth was inevitable, and that mutants must take their rightful place as the dominant species.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 161}} In Egypt, following an encounter with an unscrupulous mutant telepath, known as the [[Amahl Farouk (Earth-616)|Shadow King]], Xavier vowed to protect the world from the threat of evil mutants, endeavoring to foster peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 117}}

Ultimately, with Moira's support, Xavier decided to open a school for mutants, to secretly train them to protect a world that hates and fears them, dubbing them his '''X-Men'''.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 300}} To accomplish his goal, Xavier transformed his father's estate into the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 309}} In his "X-Mansion", he constructed the [[Danger Room]] to test and train mutants,{{r|X-Men Vol 1 1}} and developed [[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebro]], a powerful mutant detection machine.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 40}}{{r|X-Men Vol 1 7}}

After years of preparation, Xavier decided it was the time to recruit the young mutants he had been keeping track of, as anti-mutant hysteria hit its peak. With reports about a young mutant accidentally endangering and then saving a crowd of people with an optic blast, Xavier traveled to Washington D.C., seeking out FBI agent [[Frederick Duncan (Earth-616)|Fred Duncan]], who was assigned to investigate reports of mutants. Xavier convinced Duncan to allow him to enroll young mutants in his school and prepare them to battle evil mutants.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 38}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 300}}

In the following days, Xavier, as '''Professor X''', recruited [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Scott Summers]], the young mutant from the news story. Rescued from the clutches of evil mutant [[Jack Winters (Earth-616)|Jack Winters]], Scott became the first of the X-Men, codenamed '''Cyclops'''.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 39|42}} Later on, Cyclops and Professor X saved young [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Bobby Drake]], a mutant commanding extreme cold and moisture, from an angry lynch mob. Drake joined the group as '''Iceman'''.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 44|46}} Xavier's next recruit was the winged [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Warren Worthington III]], who had already embarked on a solo super-hero career as the high-flying '''Angel'''.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 54}} After a brief battle, Angel agreed to join the group.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 1 55}}-[[X-Men Vol 1 56|56]]}} Their next recruit was the dexterous and intelligent [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Hank McCoy]], whom the X-Men rescued from a would-be conqueror, the [[Orlando Furio (Earth-616)|Conquistador]]. McCoy joined Xavier under the codename '''Beast'''.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 51|53}} Rounding out the group, Xavier had [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] join them as '''Marvel Girl'''.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 1}} Jean Grey had been mentored by Xavier since childhood, after her mental powers manifested.{{r|Bizarre Adventures Vol 1 27}}

===First Class===
[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) and Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 1 cover.png|thumb|right|200px|The Uncanny X-Men vs. Magneto]]
The uncanny X-Men were formed, and their first mission brought them to a direct confrontation with Xavier's old friend, Magnus, now the self-styled "Master of Magnetism" '''Magneto''', who would become their most frequent adversary. The conflict took place in [[Cape Citadel]], in a military base Magneto had claimed. This was the first clash of Magneto and Xavier's rivalling ideologies. Although the X-Men acted as super-heroes, growing anti-mutant sentiment eventually marred their reputation.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 1}}

For their next mission, the X-Men defended Washington, D.C., from the thief and mutant teleporter known as the [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 2}} They also found that not all mutants were interested in joining their mission, when the immovable [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]] rejected an invitation to their ranks.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 3}} Moreover, the X-Men soon had interactions with the super-hero community: clashing with [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]],{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 49}} aiding the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] against the [[General (Earth-616)|General]],{{r|Sentry/X-Men Vol 1 1}} and clashing with the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] when Professor X was enslaved by the [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]],{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 28}} among many other situations.

Magneto eventually returned to plague the X-Men, this time with his own group, the so-called [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], formed by [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], the [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]] and [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Mastermind]]. They first confronted with the X-Men when trying to take over the nation of [[Santo Marco (Country)|Santo Marco]],{{r|X-Men Vol 1 4}} followed by an attempted full-on capture of the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 5}} The X-Men had subsequent disputes with the Brotherhood. The first was a failed attempt by the Brotherhood to recruit [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor, the Sub-Mariner]],{{r|X-Men Vol 1 6}} the second, a similar scenario involving the Blob,{{r|X-Men Vol 1 7}} and the third, also a failed recruitment, when the thunder god, [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], was absurdly prospected to join the Brotherhood's ranks.{{r|Journey into Mystery Vol 1 109}}

[[File:Charles Xavier (Earth-616) and the X-Men first graduation photo from X-Men Vol 1 7.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Graduation day]]
Following the X-Men's graduation,{{r|X-Men Vol 1 7}} the group experienced a rising and fanatical anti-mutant movement. Just as the X-Men were being torn apart, a future version of Beast transported Xavier's students to the future.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 8}}{{r|{{cl|All-New X-Men Vol 1 1}}-[[All-New X-Men Vol 1 2|2]]}} The young X-Men spent much time in the future, but returned with their memories of this time blocked. Upon their return,{{r|Extermination Vol 1 5}} they faced [[Gunther Bain (Earth-616)|Unus the Untouchable]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 8}} Afterwards, Professor X briefly left Cyclops in charge of the school to impede the alien [[Lucifer (Quist) (Earth-616)|Lucifer]] from conquering the world, which was foiled thanks to the assistance of the X-Men and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], beginning the two groups' long-standing association and rivalry.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 9}} The X-Men gained another ally in [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]], when an investigation about his existence at the South Pole led to the discovery of a tropical hidden paradise, the [[Savage Land]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 10}}

The X-Men finally witnessed the apparent end of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants following an encounter with the alien [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]]. This battle ended with the Stranger taking Magneto and the Toad to his space station for study and transforming Mastermind into dense matter.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 11}} New threats arose however, such as Professor X's stepbrother, [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Cain Marko]], who terrorized the X-Men as the mystically-empowered Juggernaut.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 12}} Juggernaut was defeated with the aid of the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 13}}

[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 14 cover.png|right|200px|thumb|The menace of the Sentinels]]
With anti-mutant hysteria again on the rise, scientist [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar Trask]] engineered the [[Sentinels]], giant mutant-hunting robots.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 14}} However, the robots revolted against their own master, taking Trask and Professor X to their new robotic leader, the [[Master Mold (Earth-616)|Master Mold]]. The Master Mold planned to enslave the entire human race, but the X-Men saved Xavier and found a way to destroy the Sentinels.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 15}} The encounter came to an end with Trask's death.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 16}} Trask's legacy would haunt mutantkind for years to come as his machines became one of the greatest menaces against mutants.

Still recovering from their battle against the Sentinels, the X-Men were once more targeted by a returned Magneto,{{r|X-Men Vol 1 17}} who was defeated and recaptured by the Stranger.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 18}} The X-Men then battled the mysterious [[Calvin Rankin (Earth-616)|Mimic]], a bitter young man who had the ability to replicate other people's super-powers and unraveled the X-Men's secret identities. The battle ended with Mimic stripped of his powers and with no memory of the X-Men's true identities.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 19}} Meanwhile, Lucifer resurfaced to finalize his master's alien invasion, ordering the Blob and Unus to pose as X-Men to besmirch the team's standing with the public and otherwise occupy them.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 20}} Although the Blob and Unus escaped, the X-Men succeeded in foiling Lucifer's plot.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 21}} Non-mutant threats were also faced by the X-Men, such as combating [[Luchino Nefaria (Earth-616)|Count Nefaria]]'s attempt to ransom Washington, D.C.,{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 1 22}}-[[X-Men Vol 1 23|23]]}} and battling the peculiar [[August Hopper (Earth-616)|Locust]]. When Jean Grey was forced by her parents to leave Xavier's for [[Metro College]],{{r|X-Men Vol 1 24}} she remained part of the group, although with less regularity. During this period, the team battled [[Juan Meroz (Earth-616)|El Tigre]],{{r|X-Men Vol 1 25}} preventing him from taking over the world with the power of the Mayan God, [[Kukulkan (Earth-616)|Kukulcan]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 26}}

===[[Factor Three (Story Arc)|The Factor Three Conspiracy]]===
Fearing an imminent threat, Professor X pressed the group to find new recruits. They unsuccessfully pursued Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch and Spider-Man, though managed to recruit '''Mimic''', who had just regained his memories and powers following a lab explosion at Metro College. He joined the X-Men despite the Puppet Master using him as his pawn to destroy the group.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 27}} Soon after, the X-Men learned of [[Factor Three (Earth-616)|Factor Three]], an organization that sent agents [[Brian Dunlap (Earth-616)|Ogre]] and the enslaved [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]] after them in an attempt to kidnap Professor X. Freeing Banshee from Factor Three's control, the X-Men easily defeated Ogre.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 28}}

Mimic left the team after he lost his powers when stopping the [[Super-Adaptoid (Earth-616)|Super-Adaptoid]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 29}} This was followed by the X-Men stopping [[Maha Yogi (Earth-616)|the Warlock]]'s world domination plot,{{r|X-Men Vol 1 30}} and halting [[Ralph Roberts (Earth-616)|Cobalt Man's]] rampage at [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 31}} Some time later, Cobalt Man's human brother and Jean's friend [[Theodore Roberts (Earth-616)|Ted Roberts]] asked for the X-Men's help in rescuing his brother, landing them in a conflict between the [[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Mole Man]] and [[Romulus Augustulus (Earth-616)|Tyrannus]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 34}}

Factor Three struck again when Professor X attempted to free his step-brother from the powers of the Juggernaut. The resulting experiment of both science and sorcery ended with the Juggernaut's revival and Xavier on the brink of death. Factor Three mentally contacted the Juggernaut and tried to recruit him.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 32}} The X-Men ultimately stopped the Juggernaut with the aid of [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], who banished Marko to the [[Crimson Cosmos]]. However, during the process, Factor Three managed to kidnap Professor X.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 33}}

When Banshee attempted to contact the X-Men after locating Factor Three's European headquarters, his message was interrupted, leading to the X-Men briefly battling Spider-Man, mistakenly believing the wall-crawler was a member of Factor Three.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 35}} Without enough money to pay for airfare to Europe, the X-Men tried to raise it but ended up taking a loan from the wealthy philanthropist father of [[Tom Regal (Earth-616)|Tom Regal]] after the X-Men aided in stopping Tom's rampage as the armored Mekano.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 36}}

[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 39 cover.png|left|190px|thumb|New costumes, new thrills]]
Arriving in Europe, the X-Men were captured by Factor Three, whose membership included the Vanisher, the Blob, Unus and Mastermind as well as two unknown villains: the [[Kevin Sidney (Earth-616)|Changeling]] and the [[Mutant Master (Earth-616)|Mutant Master]]. The group found the X-Men "guilty" of betraying mutantkind and sentenced them to death. Before executing the X-Men, Factor Three revealed their intentions of sparking a nuclear World War III by attacking both the [[United States of America|United States]] and the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 37}} The X-Men split into two groups, ruining both plots{{r|X-Men Vol 1 38}} and coming face-to-face with the Mutant Master at his headquarters in the United States.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 39}} There, with the aid of the Changeling, they freed Professor X. The Mutant Master was revealed as a member of the alien race, [[Siris]]. The X-Men and Factor Three then worked together to stop Mutant Master, parting peacefully though vowing to meet again as enemies. Upon returning to the X-Mansion, the X-Men were rewarded with new individual costumes designed by Jean.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 39}}

===The Death of Professor X===
[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 42 cover.png|right|200px|thumb|The Death of Professor X]]
Professor Xavier learned of an impending invasion from the alien [[Z'nox (Race)|Z'nox]] race. Needing time to prepare, he made plans to place himself in seclusion. Approached by the terminally ill Changeling, Professor X made a deal with the dying mutant, who aided him in his role by posing as Professor X for the X-Men, while the real Xavier prepared for the invasion. Jean Grey was the only member of the X-Men who was made aware of Xavier's plan, having her telepathic powers unlocked by the Professor. Xavier proceeded into seclusion while '''Changeling''' took his place.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 65}} When the subterranean [[Gor-Tok (Earth-616)|Grotesk]], mutated by the underground nuclear testing that destroyed his people, threatened the Earth,{{r|X-Men Vol 1 41}} Changeling (posing as Professor X) sacrificed his life to stop the threat.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 42}}

After the funeral, the X-Men were captured and imprisoned by Magneto, who had just reformed the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 43}} Also wishing to get revenge against the Avengers, Magneto allowed Angel to escape to lure the other team to his hideout.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 1 44}}-[[X-Men Vol 1 45|45]]}} Although Magneto pitted the X-Men and the Avengers against each other, the two groups succeeded in defeating him, and he seemingly perished in an explosion.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 53}}

Returning to the X-Mansion and still mourning the loss of their mentor, the X-Men were visited by Agent Duncan who read the X-Men Xavier's final will, bequeathing everything to them. Meanwhile, Juggernaut had been temporarily returned to Earth before being shunted off to the Crimson Cosmos once more after battling the X-Men. Agent Duncan then informed the X-Men that they were ordered by the government to disband for their own safety.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 46}} This split proved to be short-lived. After Beast and Iceman battled the Warlock (now calling himself the Maha Yogi),{{r|X-Men Vol 1 47}} and Cyclops and Marvel Girl battled [[Quasi-Motivational Destruct Organism (Earth-616)|Quasimodo]],{{r|X-Men Vol 1 48}} the group was drawn back together when Cerebro detected a large concentration of mutants in the [[San Francisco]] area.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 49}}

[[File:Mesmero (Vincent) (Earth-616) and X-Men (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 50.png|thumb|left|150px|The X-Men face off Mesmero]]
While investigating, the X-Men met a mutant named [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Lorna Dane]] and learned that [[Mesmero (Vincent) (Earth-616)|Mesmero]], a mutant hypnotist, was amassing an army of mutants in the name of Magneto to enslave humanity.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 49}} Believing Lorna to be the daughter of Magneto, Mesmero took her and Iceman to his Mutant City, outside of San Francisco, where Lorna's latent mutant magnetic powers were activated. As the X-Men came to their rescue, Lorna stayed behind during their escape, deciding to remain loyal to [[Magneto (Machinesmith Android) (Earth-616)|her supposed father]]{{r|X-Men Vol 1 50}} (actually an android).{{r|X-Men Vol 1 58}} The X-Men returned to destroy the Mutant City, having Cyclops pose as an evil mutant named [[Erik the Red]] in order to infiltrate their militia.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 51}} During the ensuing battle, Iceman provided Lorna evidence that she was not Magneto's daughter. She helped the X-Men defeat “Magneto” and Mesmero, leading to Mutant City' detonation. '''Lorna Dane''' returned with the X-Men to New York City.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 52}} Later, an accident during a test of one of the Professor's inventions led to the X-Men accidentally teleporting [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]] from the [[Negative Zone]] to Earth. During the ensuing battle, Blastaar was seemingly killed when the machine to which he was linked short-circuited.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 53}}

Cyclops reentered the life of his brother [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Alex]] who had just graduated from university. Bizarrely, Alex was captured by the [[Ahmet Abdol (Earth-616)|Living Pharaoh]], a mutant who found that his and Alex's mutant powers were linked.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 54}} Tracking the Pharaoh to [[Egypt]], the X-Men battled him there and learned that Alex was a mutant who could emit plasma energy.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 55}} In the ensuing battle, the Pharaoh had full access to Alex's powers, being transformed into the Living Monolith. Alex managed to break free, cutting off the Living Monolith's powers, but was left horrified to find that he did not have control over his new-found powers.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 56}}

[[File:Alexander Summers (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 58 002.png|right|200px|thumb|Havok unleashed]]
Before Alex could be helped by the X-Men, he was captured by Sentinels, that had been rebuilt by [[Lawrence Trask (Earth-616)|Larry Trask]] with the aid of Judge [[Robert Chalmers (Earth-616)|Robert Chalmers]]. Trask revived the Sentinels to get revenge against mutants in general, and the X-Men in particular, for the death of his father, Bolivar Trask. Giving Alex a uniform to regulate his powers and naming him '''Havok''', Trask had the confused mutant aid him in capturing all known mutants, including Iceman, Lorna Dane, and various X-Men villains.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 57}} Havok aided the X-Men in defeating the Sentinels and learned that Trask was actually a mutant himself.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 58}} Cyclops ultimately managed to convince the Sentinels to destroy the source of mutations, leading the Sentinels to fly into the sun.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 59}}

The X-Men put a heavily injured Havok into the care of [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Dr. Karl Lykos]], who secretly required the energies of other people to survive. However, the life energies of mutants caused Lykos to mutate into the powerful pterodactyl-like humanoid called Sauron.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 60}} Sauron fled to Tierra del Fuego and reverted back to Lykos, being tracked by the X-Men were unable to stop him from seemingly committing suicide to avoid draining the energy of his lover, [[Tanya Anderssen (Earth-616)|Tanya]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 61}} From there, the X-Men traveled into the Savage Land, reuniting with Ka-Zar and agreeing to aid him against the [[Savage Land Mutates (Earth-616)|Savage Land Mutates]]. Meanwhile, Angel was duped into joining with the Mutates by their leader, the Creator (secretly Magneto).{{r|X-Men Vol 1 62}} As Angel learned the truth, he assisted the X-Men in defeating Magneto and destroying his citadel.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 63}}

Returning to the United States, the X-Men went to Washington D.C. to stop [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]], a fire-wielding mutant from [[Japan]], from interrupting an important conference between US and Japanese officials.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 64}} Back to the X-Mansion, the X-Men were shocked when Professor X turned up alive and well and explained to them that he had been preparing for the coming Z'Nox invasion. With the help of Cyclops' and Havok's powers, the Professor linked every mind on Earth in order to drive the Z'Nox invasion away.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 65}} The victory left the Professor on the brink of death, requiring the X-Men to seek out the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], whose human persona had the knowledge to cure the Professor.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 66}}

===[[X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1|The Hidden Years]]===
As Professor X returned, Iceman decided to leave the team over feeling betrayed over Xavier's secrets. Learning what happened in his absence, Professor X sent the remaining X-Men back to the Savage Land to recover the body of Magneto.{{r|X-Men The Hidden Years Vol 1 1}} The X-Men were soon embroiled in stopping the [[Nhu’Ghari]] race from enslaving other Savage Land natives, while Marvel Girl learned that Magneto was actually alive.{{r|{{cl|X-Men The Hidden Years Vol 1 2}}-[[X-Men The Hidden Years Vol 1 4|4]]}} The X-Men found and defeated Magneto, capturing him. When a storm hit their craft, Magneto escaped, while Angel and his Nhu’Ghari ally named [[Avia (Savage Land) (Earth-616)|Avia]] were lost at sea. Cyclops, Marvel Girl, and the Beast were whisked away to Kenya where they met the young [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Ororo]], a mutant who could control the weather, and helped her defeat the villain [[Deluge (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Deluge]].{{r|{{cl|X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 5}}-[[X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 7|7]]}}

The remaining X-Men returned home only to be met by the Fantastic Four,{{r|X-Men The Hidden Years Vol 1 7}} who were assisting Professor X with the Z'Nox crisis. Though the X-Men stopped an invasion on Earth, they did not prevent the Z'Nox from turning their invasion fleet on another world. Teamed up with the Fantastic Four, the X-Men went to space, where Jean's mind was briefly contacted by the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]]. The X-Men and the Fantastic Four worked together to shunt the Z'Nox home-world into the Negative Zone where it could not harm anyone.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 8}}-[[X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 9|9]]}}

[[File:X-Men The Hidden Years Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|200px|X-Men's hidden years]]
Professor X and Beast temporarily left the X-Mansion to monitor a new mutant detected by Cerebro, a little girl named [[Ashley Martin (Earth-616)|Ashley Martin]], who had mental control over one of Trask's damaged Sentinels.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 10}}-[[X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 13|13]]}} Meanwhile, Cyclops and Marvel Girl searched for a missing Angel, assisted by [[Candace Southern (Earth-616)|Candy Southern]], Angel's girlfriend. Captured by a man named [[Stefan Krueger (Earth-616)|Stefan Krueger]], Angel and the X-Men were sold to the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants,{{r|X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 11}} but managed to defeat the villains.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 13}}-[[X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 14|14]]}} On the Savage Land, Havok, Lorna Dane and an amnesiac Iceman got caught up in a battle between Sauron and Magneto. The battle ended with Magneto's defeat and Iceman regaining his memories.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 2}}-[[X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 12|12]]}}

While Professor X chose to stay with the Martins for a while, all the X-Men returned to the X-Mansion, where Candy warned Angel that his uncle, the villain known as [[Burt Worthington (Earth-616)|Dazzler]], had plans to marry [[Kathryn Worthington (Earth-616)|Angel's mother]].{{r|X-Men The Hidden Years Vol 1 14}} The X-Men stopped the wedding, but were too late to prevent Angel's mother from dying of the poison Burt had administered to her.{{r|X-Men The Hidden Years Vol 1 15}} Finding Havok and Lorna Dane gone after Cerebro signaled mutant presence in the [[Himalayas]], the X-Men went after them and realized Cerebro's initial signal picked up the hidden realm of the [[Inhumans]].{{r|X-Men The Hidden Years Vol 1 16}} Returning home, the X-Men found their friend Avia poisoned by [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]], who challenged one of the X-Men to beat him in combat for the cure. The Beast accepted, winning the duel.{{r|X-Men The Hidden Years Vol 1 17}}

Lorna vanished soon after, after put under the mental control of [[Tad Carter (Earth-616)|Tad Carter]]. The X-Men found that Tad was a member of a group called the [[Promise (Earth-616)|Promise]], mutants who intended to shape human and mutantkind.{{r|X-Men The Hidden Years Vol 1 18}} Following a brief confrontation, some of the X-Men were sent to their doom, ending up unconscious in the realm of the Mole Man.{{r|X-Men The Hidden Years Vol 1 19}} Meanwhile, Magneto and the Sub-Mariner carried on an attack on Earth, which was being opposed by the Fantastic Four.<ref>[[X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 20]]-[[X-Men: The Hidden Years Vol 1 21|21]] and between the events of [[Fantastic Four Vol 1 103]]-[[Fantastic Four Vol 1 104|104]]</ref> Ultimately, the rest of the X-Men escaped from the Mole Man's clutches and were reunited with Angel, while Havok managed to free Lorna from the Promise, who parted company when their leader [[Tobias Messenger (Earth-616)|Tobias Messenger]] was secretly killed by one of their own. After these events, Professor X returned to his X-Men at the X-Mansion.{{r|X-Men The Hidden Years Vol 1 22}}

Beast left the team for a position at the [[Brand Corporation]] where he further mutated while battling the [[Secret Empire (Earth-616)|Secret Empire]].{{r|Amazing Adventures Vol 2 11}} Soon after, the X-Men and other mutants were targeted by the Secret Empire, seen as a valuable power source, which led the X-Men to team up with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] the [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] to defeat the Secret Empire and free the captured mutants.{{r|{{cl|Captain America Vol 1 172}}-[[Captain America Vol 1 175|175]]}}

===[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1|Deadly Genesis]]===
[[File:X-Men Deadly Genesis Vol 1 4 Textless.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Moira's secret X-Men]]
When Cerebro registered a large mutant energy signature on the island [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], the X-Men went to investigate. They learned to their horror that the entire island was one single mutant environment, who captured the X-Men as it fed upon the life forces of mutants.{{r|Giant-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}} To save his students, Xavier gathered a group of mutants who were mentored by Moira to form a new team of X-Men. These X-Men included [[Petra (Earth-616)|'''Petra''']], [[Suzanne Chan (Earth-616)|'''Sway''']], [[Armando Muñoz (Earth-616)|'''Darwin''']], and [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|'''Kid Vulcan''']], the last one being Cyclops' lost youngest brother. The inexperienced group went to Krakoa and was rapidly overpowered by the island: Petra and Sway were massacred by the island while Darwin and Kid Vulcan, unknown to everyone, were saved by forcing themselves to a dormant state. Through their sacrifice, Cyclops was free and managed to return to Professor X, believing everyone to be dead, in shock over the ordeal. Professor X telepathically wiped out all memory of Moira's ill-fated group of X-Men and decided to recruit another new team to face Krakoa.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 6}}{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 1}}

This new group of X-Men consisted of German demon-looking teleporter [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|'''Nightcrawler''']], Canadian berserker [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|'''Wolverine''']], Irish former member of Factor Three '''Banshee''', African wind rider Ororo, now known as '''Storm''', Japanese son of the atom '''Sunfire''', Russian strongman [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|'''Colossus''']], and Native American stubborn [[John Proudstar (Earth-616)|'''Thunderbird''']]. This group succeeded in freeing the original X-Men and, as both groups combined their powers to send Krakoa into Earth orbit, its threat ended.{{r|Giant-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}}

===All-New, All-Different X-Men===
[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) from Giant-Size X-Men Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|200px|left|thumb|The all-new, all-different X-Men]]
After their return, Sunfire and all of the previous X-Men left except for Cyclops, who was in charge of leading the new team. Cyclops had to adjust to new dynamics, such as once again receiving orders from Professor X and also leading a group of older and experienced X-Men who were not used to teamwork. During the new team's second mission against Count Nefaria and his [[Ani-Men (Earth-616)|Ani-Men]], Thunderbird was tragically killed.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 94|95}} As the X-Men coped with his death, Moira moved to the X-Mansion, assisting Xavier in his work and also proving her worth as a combatant as she helped the X-Men battle the demonic [[N'Garai]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 96}}

Meanwhile, two new threats came to light: the [[Shi'ar]] mercenary [[Davan Shakari (Earth-616)|Eric the Red]], who kidnapped Havok and Lorna (now adopting the codename Polaris), and mutant-hater [[Stephen Lang (Earth-616)|Stephen Lang]], who reactivated the Sentinels.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 97}} Upon reentry to Earth after a mission in space against Lang's [[Sentinel Mk III|Sentinels]], Jean Grey pushed herself to the limit holding their spacecraft together and shielding her team members from intense radiation.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 98|100}} Believed dead upon their crash landing in New York's [[Jamaica Bay]], Jean suddenly arose from the ocean calling herself '''Phoenix''' and wielding more power than ever before.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 101}}

[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) and Phoenix Force (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 101 cover.png|thumb|right|200px|The Phoenix is born]]
Soon after confronting Banshee's cousin, [[Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616)|Black Tom Cassidy]], who had allied himself with the Juggernaut at the [[Cassidy Keep]],{{r|X-Men Vol 1 101|103}} the X-Men returned to space to aid [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Lilandra Neramani]] of the Shi'ar stop her mad brother [[D'ken Neramani (Earth-616)|D'ken]], who controlled the powerful [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]], from using the power of the [[M'kraan Crystal]] to take over the universe. With the crystal about to shatter and destroy reality itself, Phoenix used her awesome power to fuse it back together. During this adventure, the X-Men met the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]], a revolutionary crew of space pirates led by Cyclops' and Havok's father, [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|Corsair]]. The X-Men returned to Earth, and Lilandra returned with them.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 105|108}}

At the X-Mansion, the X-Men were attacked by the Canadian military super-hero known as Weapon Alpha, who intended to retrieve Wolverine back to [[Department H (Earth-616)|Department H]]. However, Weapon Alpha was heavily outnumbered and had no choice but to flee as he confronted the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 109}} The X-Men were once again attacked at their own home by the mercenary [[Mitchell Tanner (Earth-616)|Warhawk]], who had trapped the X-Men in the Danger Room. However, the X-Men broke free and managed to defeat the villain.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 110}}

Following a conflict with Mesmero and a fierce battle with Magneto inside an Antarctic volcano,{{r|X-Men Vol 1 111|113}} most of the X-Men found themselves in the Savage Land and separated from Phoenix and the Avenger Beast, with each group presuming the other dead. Phoenix and Beast returned to the school to give Xavier the tragic news. Believing his X-Men to be dead and having nothing to keep him on Earth, Xavier chose to accompany Lilandra back to Shi'ar space as her consort.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 114}}

[[File:Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616) and Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 128 001.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Colossus finishes Proteus]]
The X-Men slowly made their way home after adventures in the Savage Land,{{r|X-Men Vol 1 115|116}} and in Japan, where Banshee injured his vocal cords during a battle with [[Moses Magnum (Earth-616)|Moses Magnum]], leaving him powerless.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 118|119}} The X-Men were then ambushed by Weapon Alpha (now rebranded as Vindicator) and his new team, [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]], on the way back to the United States, as they intended to take Wolverine back into the Canadian government's custody. Wolverine escaped by successfully tricking Alpha Flight into believing he wished to return to Department H.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 120|121}} When they finally returned home, they found Professor X gone and the X-Mansion uninhabited. As soon as the X-Men returned, they were ambushed by [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]], being briefly trapped in his [[Murderworld]].{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 1 122}}-[[X-Men Vol 1 124|124]]}} Phoenix was reunited with the X-Men at Moira's headquarters on [[Muir Island]], where they battled [[Proteus (Kevin MacTaggart)|Proteus]], Moira's reality-altering mutant son. Vulnerable to metal, Proteus stood no chance against Colossus' steel fists. Despite his injuries, Banshee still accompanied the X-Men for the mission. However, realizing he wanted to stay by Moira's side, he left the X-Men to be with her.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 125|128}}

===[[Dark Phoenix]]===
Professor X returned to Earth to find his X-Men alive and in time to recruit new mutants for his school. The first candidates were [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]], a teenage girl with intangibility powers, and [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]], a performer with light-based abilities. These two mutants were also the interest of the macabre mutant secret society known as the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]]. This led the X-Men to directly confront one of the Hellfire Club's high ranked members, [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], the White Queen, who was overpowered by Phoenix after having captured half the team.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 129|131}}

[[File:Phoenix Force (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 134 0001.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Dark Phoenix!]]
Meanwhile, it was revealed that Mastermind, who wished to join the Hellfire Club under his alter-ego “Jason Wyngarde”, had been casting illusionary fantasies in Phoenix's mind for months, awakening the darkest parts of her soul. Ultimately, he convinced her to become the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club during the X-Men's battle against their inner circle, namely [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]], [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]], and [[Harold Leland (Earth-616)|Harry Leland]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 132|134}} Phoenix broke free from Wyngarde's control by unleashing her dark side, becoming Dark Phoenix. She used her powers to drive Mastermind insane, destroyed the [[Blackbird]], and abruptly departed from Earth. Starving for the same sense of power she had felt inside the M'Kraan Crystal, Phoenix traveled to a distant star and absorbed its energy, destroying a nearby planet inhabited by five billion [[D'bari (Race)|aliens]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 135}}

Upon her return to Earth, Beast had designed a neutralizer to subdue the all-powerful entity, and Xavier, assisted by the Angel, placed mental blocks in her mind to reduce Dark Phoenix's powers and allow Jean to regain control.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 136}} Aware of the massacre in their Empire, the Shi'ar arrived on Earth demanding the execution of Dark Phoenix. Xavier invoked Arin'nn Haelar, an irrefutable Shi'ar duel of honor. Knowing her team would win, Majestrix Lilandra agreed to allow the Imperial Guard to battle the X-Men. Putting up a valiant fight, the mutants fell one-by-one during a long battle on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]]. With only Cyclops and Phoenix left standing, Summers was hit by a stray energy bolt. Set into a panic, Jean Grey was able to utilize her full power as Dark Phoenix. To avert the loss of the entire star system, as it had been ordered by Lilandra, Xavier ordered the X-Men to defeat Phoenix. As Jean regained control once more, she activated a weapon and committed suicide to avert another disaster.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 137}} After Jean Grey's funeral, '''Kitty Pryde''' came to live at the school as the newest X-Man, Sprite.

Storm became the leader in Cyclops's absence. As she helped Kitty adjust to her new life at Xavier's, Wolverine and Nightcrawler assisted Alpha Flight in arresting the cannibal monster [[Georges Baptiste (Earth-616)|Wendigo]] in Canada.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 139|140}} Storm's leadership underwent a trial-by-fire when Pryde's consciousness was replaced by a [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|future version of herself]] called Kate. Kate claimed she was sent back to the past to prevent a dystopic future, result of mutants being the target of immense fear and hatred following the assassination of [[Robert Kelly (Earth-616)|Senator Kelly]] by the hands of a new formation of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by the shape-shifter [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]]. After a desperate conflict, Kelly's life was saved and the Brotherhood was arrested, preventing an immediate catastrophic future for mutants.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 141|142}} Notable foes from this period included [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] and Arcade.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145|147}} Angel, seeing Wolverine as a dangerous man, decided to leave the team as it no longer represented Xavier's original views.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 148}}

[[File:Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) and Katherine Pryde (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men vol 1 150 001.png|thumb|left|125px|Magneto accidentally slays Sprite]]
Meanwhile, Cyclops unexpectedly found Magneto's [[Island M]] in the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. Magneto threatened humanity with an ultimatum: accept mutant supremacy and give up armed conflict forever, attacking a soviet military submarine in the process. The X-Men infiltrated his base and, as Kitty destroyed the central computer of his super-weapon, Magneto lashed out and almost killed her. Horrified at his actions, Magneto ceased fighting and contemplated how he had become no better than the humans who had massacred his family. This battle reunited Cyclops with the team.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 150}} Around this period, Xavier and Moira formed a secret alliance with Magneto, as both parts agreed that mutantkind was fated to lose.{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 2}}

Following another confrontation between the X-Men and the Hellfire Club, who had capture Storm and Kitty and attacked the X-Men with Sentinels,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 151|152}} Corsair and the Starjammers visited to Earth seeking the X-Men's aid in stopping a rebellion against Majestrix Lilandra. The Starjammers were framed for kidnapping Lilandra while the one responsible was really [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]], the Majestrix' sister, in league with the alien [[Brood (Race)|Brood]]. The X-Men discovered the truth, stopped the rebellion against the Shi'ar empire, and reunited Xavier with Lilandra, though Xavier was severely wounded by the Brood. Also, Cyclops finally discovered that Corsair was actually his father, abducted by the Shi'ar decades earlier.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 154|157}}

Shortly thereafter a television interview with Senator Robert Kelly worried the X-Men, who had FBI connections in their early years, and thus had government files on many of them. [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol Danvers]], Wolverine, Storm, and Nightcrawler infiltrated the [[Pentagon]] and uploaded an open-ended virus that erased all references to the X-Men or members of the team. While in the Pentagon, they also encountered and fought Mystique and [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 158}}

Soon after, the X-Men had two life deciding encounters with beings of extreme evil. First, Storm became a victim of [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]], the lord of vampires.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 159}} Then, [[Illyana Rasputin (Earth-616)|Illyana]], Colossus' younger sister, was kidnapped by the demon-lord [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]], spending years of her life in his demonic realm, [[Limbo (Otherplace)|Limbo]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 160}} Both Storm and Illyana were saved by the X-Men, but left forever marked by these encounters.

[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 162 001.png|thumb|right|150px|Wolverine fights for his life on Sleazeworld]]
Meanwhile, as Xavier's condition worsened, Deathbird and the Brood resurfaced, abducting the X-Men, Lilandra, and Carol Danvers to their home planet, where a Brood Queen implanted embryos within them. Interested by Danvers unique genetic code, she was experimented upon and became Binary. Although the X-Men escaped from "Sleazeworld" all seemed lost, as once the embryos matured their hosts would undergo a metamorphosis and become a warrior Brood. Storm was saved by a young [[Acanti]], a large space-faring creature that had been enslaved by the Brood and used as living starships. With nothing left to lose, the X-Men vowed to save the Acanti race. After freeing the Acanti "prophet-singer" soul from the Brood homeworld, the X-Men were healed. Before killing the Brood Queen, Kitty Pryde found the friendly dragon [[Lockheed (Earth-616)|'''Lockheed''']] who followed her back to Earth.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 161|166}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 168}}

===The X-Family Grows===
During the prolonged period when the X-Men were abducted by the Brood, Xavier believed they had been killed. Moira convinced him to form a new team of adolescent mutants who were in need of help in controlling their powers. Unwilling to see more of his students perish, Professor X was only willing to train them in the use of their special abilities rather than sending them out into combat as he had with the X-Men. These [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|'''New Mutants''']] ended up in many battles regardless, and occasionally aided the X-Men.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel Vol 1 4}}

[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) and William Stryker (Earth-616) from Marvel Graphic Novel Vol 1 5 001.png|left|thumb|200px|Reverend Stryker threatens the X-Men]]
As they returned to Earth, the X-Men learned there was one Brood Queen embryo that had not been eliminated, being implanted in Professor Xavier during their first contact with the evil aliens. Racing home, they found Xavier had already been transformed into one of the Brood while battling the startled New Mutants. Defeated and taken onboard the [[Starjammer]], Xavier's mind was placed in a cloned body, which with time allowed him to regain use of his legs.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 167}}

Anti-mutant hysteria paved the way to the establishment of one of the most horrendous enemies of mutantkind, [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Reverend William Stryker]]'s [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]], mutant hater fundamentalists who had an agenda of murdering defenseless mutants. The X-Men were targeted by the Purifiers with mediatic and physical attacks, leading to the capture of Professor X, Cyclops, and Storm. In an unexpected team-up with Magneto, the X-Men saved their teammates. During the final confrontation, Stryker threatened Kitty Pryde with death but was a victim of his own hate as he was shot dead by a policeman.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel Vol 1 5}}

[[File:Ororo Munroe (Earth-616) and Callisto (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 170 001.png|right|thumb|175px|Storm vs. Callisto, to death!]]
The X-Men found conflict with mutant adversaries, the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]], outcasts who lived underground led by [[Callisto (Earth-616)|Callisto]]. Angel was captured by Callisto and taken down into [[Alley|their tunnels]] to be her groom. Meanwhile, Kitty was found by another Morlock, [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]], whom she had met months earlier. As the X-Men went to rescue their allies, a violent combat between Storm and Callisto ensued, with no powers and to the death. Victorious, Storm took the leadership of the Morlocks and Angel's freedom.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 169|171}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 148}}

The X-Men found extra dilemmas with other sections of mutantkind when '''Rogue''' asked them for asylum and help after finding herself unable of controlling her powers and fractured psyche. Though the X-Men refused to accept Rogue as a member of the team, Professor X insisted on taking her on as a student, vowing never to bail on a mutant in need of help.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 171}} Rogue soon proved her worth to the X-Men when she put herself at risk to save Wolverine and his fiancée, [[Mariko Yashida (Earth-616)|Mariko]], from [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]] and the [[Kenuichio Harada (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]].{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 172}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 173|173]]}} However, Mystique was not content with Rogue's dismissal from the Brotherhood, ordering her team to attack the X-Men, while she captured Professor X, demanding Rogue's return. She was eventually talked out of her insane ploy by Rogue herself and ultimately released Xavier.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 177|178}}

[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616) and Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 173 001.png|left|125px|thumb|Rogue proves her worth]]
The X-Men's personal lives also intertwined with their adventures. After returning from space, Cyclops took an absence from the X-Men and met [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]] during a trip to meet his grandparents in Anchorage.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 168}} Rapidly, they started a relationship.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 170}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 173|173]]}} Though Mastermind attempted to foil their romance, he was defeated by the X-Men, which was celebrated by Cyclops' and Madelyne's wedding.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 174}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 175|175]]}} Where Mastermind failed in destroying Cyclops' marriage, he succeeded in ruining Wolverine's.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 173}} As members of the X-Men, Storm and Kitty Pryde experience drastic changes in their lives. Storm realized she had succumbed to more violent aspects of her personality, especially after meeting the assassin known as [[Yukio (Earth-616)|Yukio]] in Japan. Kitty, after having an experience also in Japan in which she was brainwashed by [[Ogun (Ninja) (Earth-616)|Ogun]], took up the mantle of Shadowcat, reflecting her darker attitude.{{r|{{cl|Kitty Pryde and Wolverine Vol 1 1}}-[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine Vol 1 6|6]]}}

[[File:Ororo Munroe (Earth-616) and Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 185 001.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Storm loses her powers]]
Due to her past as a mutant terrorist and her recent infiltration on a [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] helicarrier, Rogue was targeted as a menace.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 182}} On [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Gyrich]]'s request and [[Valerie Cooper (Earth-616)|Val Cooper]]'s approval, mutant inventor [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]] created a [[Neutralizer (Forge)|dampening weapon]] to extirpate Rogue's powers. Gyrich erroneously shot Storm, who was left powerless under Forge's care.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 185|188}}

Meanwhile, '''Rachel Summers''', a time-traveler from Kate Pryde's [[Earth-811|alternate future]] and daughter of Cyclops and Phoenix, arrived in the present, bringing the attention of mutant succubus [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]], who desired her immense life force. Rachel was rescued by the X-Men and joined their ranks.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 184}} However, she was unknowingly followed by super-advanced sentinel [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 191}} The X-Men learned of Nimrod's existence, as he went public during a mission to capture Juggernaut.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 194}} The robot successfully manipulated public opinion to see him as a paragon against the mutant threat.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 197}} The death of Thunderbird haunted Xavier when he was kidnapped by [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|James Proudstar]], Thunderbird's younger brother, who sought revenge against the X-Men for his brother's death. Following a confrontation between the X-Men and Emma Frost's students, the [[Hellions (Earth-616)|Hellions]], Proudstar released Xavier.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 193}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 200 Textless.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The trial of Magneto]]
Following the immense threat of the omnipotent [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]], the X-Men ironically had '''Magneto''' joining their ranks.{{r|Secret Wars II Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 196}} While attending a [[Holocaust (Event)|Holocaust]] memorial gathering, Magneto was captured by [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]], Mystique's new mutant team sanctioned by Val Cooper.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 199}} Put on trial in Paris, Magneto was mostly exonerated of charges, but the trial was interrupted by the [[Fenris (Earth-616)|Fenris]] twins, who sent Magneto and Professor X for a ride in the Parisian sewers. Half-drowned and near-death from other medical conditions, Xavier convinced his old friend to take his place as headmaster of the institute. Lilandra took Xavier from Earth to recuperate from his injuries.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 200}} Using the alias of Michael Xavier, Charles Xavier's alleged cousin, Magneto was Headmaster for a long tenure.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 35|75}}

When [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops' and Madelyne's son]] was born, Cyclops left the X-Men, now truly passing their leadership to Storm.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 201}} With Xavier on space, Magneto as the school's headmaster and Jean Grey returned from the dead, the original members of the X-Men could not recognize their former team anymore and decided to found their own independent mutant initiative, known as [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|'''X-Factor''']].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Nimrod (Earth-811) and X-Men (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 208 001.png|thumb|right|150px|Nimrod comes to exterminate the X-Men]]
Meanwhile, Rachel claimed the Phoenix powers for herself and started to be seen as a menace by her fellow X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 199}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 202|203}} When she infiltrated the Hellfire Club mansion, with the aim of murdering Selene, she was stopped by Wolverine, who mortally wounded her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 207}} Teamed up with the Morlocks, the X-Men went to the Hellfire Club to retrieve Rachel and put an end at Selene's maleficent deeds. Such a high agglomeration of mutants caught the attention of Nimrod. The mutants joined their forces to successfully destroy Nimrod. However, Rachel vanished, being captured by the mysterious [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]] and the dreadful [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]].{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 209}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 210|210]]}}

Mojo and Spiral also took interest in other mutants, such as British telepath [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] and New Mutants [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]] and [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]], who were enslaved in the wicked [[Mojoverse]], but saved by the New Mutants.{{r|New Mutants Annual Vol 1 2}} Soon after, Mojo sent the hero [[Longshot (Mojoverse)|Longshot]] to the X-Men's Danger Room and captured the X-Men themselves, de-aging them into [[X-Babies (Mojoverse)|children]]. Once again, the New Mutants saved the day.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 10}} After these events, Psylocke and a comatose Longshot stayed at the X-Mansion.

===[[Mutant Massacre]]===
[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 210 Textless.png|right|thumb|200px|The X-Men witness the mutant massacre]]
The [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]], secretly commanded by [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]], made a substantial impact on the X-Men with their callous murder of most of the Morlocks living in the [[Alley]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 210|213}} In their first battle with the X-Men, the Marauders took a gruesome toll, paralyzing Colossus, putting Nightcrawler in a coma, and trapping Shadowcat in an intangible state such that she was slowly discorporating. Magneto succeeded in healing Colossus, who rejoined the team, but Shadowcat and Nightcrawler were beyond the X-Men's help, being sent to the Muir Island to be treated by Moira.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 210|213}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 215|217}}<ref>Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat would be saved by the combined know-how of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] and [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] in {{cl|Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men #4}}, although she would remain in convalescence until after [[Fall of the Mutants]].</ref>

After the massacre of the Morlocks, the Marauders kept harassing the X-Men. One of their members, [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]], attacked them at home, in a brawl throughout the X-Mansion, rendering Cerebro destroyed, but granting '''Psylocke''' a place on the team.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 213}} Another member, [[Alice MacAllister (Earth-616)|Malice]], tried to possess '''Dazzler''', who was saved by and joined the ranks of the X-Men though.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 214}} Upon arriving at Muir Island, these new recruits, including a recovered '''Longshot''', had their baptism of fire as X-Men by facing off Juggernaut.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 215|218}} As they returned to the X-Men, they were met by Havok, who was also targeted by the Marauders, but ultimately escaped rejoining the X-Men. However, where Dazzler escaped Malice, Polaris did not, becoming the Marauders' new leader.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 219}} Another prey for the Marauders was '''Madelyne Pryor''' and her son, who were brutally stalked by them. As she tried to escape her harassers, she was rescued by the X-Men, who for this time decided to be the hunters. Overpowered, the Marauders escaped. Unfortunately, Madelyne's baby went missing during the pursuit.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 221|223}}

===[[Fall of the Mutants]]===
When Storm went missing, on a journey to recover her powers, the X-Men searched for her at Forge's [[Eagle Plaza]], in [[Dallas]], [[Texas (State)|Texas]], where they were attacked by [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]]. During the fight, a rift opened in the sky of Dallas and a maelstrom of bizarre events ensued. The X-Men and Freedom Force formed a temporary alliance to save the citizens of Dallas. As Storm regained her powers with the help of Forge and Eagle Plaza was destroyed, it was revealed that the entity known as the [[Adversary (Earth-616)|Adversary]] was behind the events. The X-Men battled the [[Adversary (Earth-616)|Adversary]] and sacrificed their lives to imprison him with a spell cast by Forge. These events had been broadcast on TV and the world believed the heroes to be dead. Meanwhile, [[Roma (Otherworld)|Roma]] recovered the X-Men's souls, granting them access into the [[Starlight Citadel]] and restoring them to life. While improving public opinion on the heroism of mutants, the X-Men's friends and family believed them to be dead. Exhausted from being constantly targeted by villains such as the Marauders, they decided to use the story as a cover to go underground.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 224}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 227|227]]}} Shadowcat, Nightcrawler, and Phoenix, as a consequence of the “death” of the X-Men, formed the mutant group [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|'''Excalibur''']] to keep Xavier's dream alive somehow.{{r|Excalibur Special Edition Vol 1 1}}

[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) and Reavers (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 229 cover.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The X-Men take over the Reavers' base]]
Though the X-Men evaded their former enemies, they soon made new ones. Relocated to the Australian Outback, they confronted the deadly mercenaries known as the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]], whose [[Cooterman's Creek|base]] they claimed, liberating [[Gateway (Earth-616)|'''Gateway''']] and [[Jessán Hoan (Earth-616)|Jessán Hoan]] in the process. With the Reavers thrown out, Roma greeted the X-Men making them undetectable by electronics and presenting them with the [[Siege Perilous]], a gem that casts a portal which grants any person who walked through it judgment and a new chance at life.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 229}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 230|230]]}} During this period, the X-Men battled mutants infected by the Brood in [[Denver]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 233|234}} Soon after, the X-Men made enemies of the [[Genosha|Genoshan]] government and its mutant oppressing regime after rescuing [[Jennifer Ransome (Earth-616)|Jenny Ransome]] and Madelyne Pryor in a covert ops mission on the island.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 235|238}}

[[File:Inferno Promo Ad 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Madelyne Pryor unleashes an Inferno]]
When the X-Men performed missions, Madelyne assisted them as their tech support. Little by little, she was seduced and corrupted by the demon from Limbo [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]], ultimately making a deal with him to find her son, becoming the Goblin Queen. {{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 239}} Meanwhile, the X-Men tracked the Marauders down, finding them in [[Manhattan]]. While the X-Men battled the Marauders, N'astirh took Madelyne to Mister Sinister's [[State Home for Foundlings|orphanage]], where she found her son and learned about her origin as Jean Grey's clone. Her corruption as the Goblin Queen unleashed a hellish [[Inferno (Event)|Inferno]] in New York in the form of a demonic invasion.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 240}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 241|241]]}} As X-Factor also looked for the baby, they eventually met and teamed up with the X-Men for the first time, defeating N'astirth.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 242}} In an insane outburst, Madelyne put the life of her own son at risk, being opposed by the X-Men and X-Factor. She ultimately was killed in an attempt to take down Jean Grey with her, who absorbed the Phoenix essence within Madelyne.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 38}} With Madelyne dead, the X-Men traveled to the ruins of the X-Mansion, to confront Mister Sinister, who was telepathically attacking Jean Grey.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 243}} After a long fight, Cyclops managed to blast Sinister with a full power optic blast, seemingly destroying him.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 39}}

Though the X-Men survived the Inferno, they soon found their end. First, Nimrod was revealed to be functional and, merging itself with the Master Mold, attacked Rogue and Psylocke in New York City. The X-Men went to help their teammates but were overpowered. With only Dazzler and Rogue left standing, Dazzler cast the Siege Perilous hoping her enemy would be sucked into the portal. While the portal appeared, the Sentinel anchored itself to the ground and grabbed Rogue as she tried to push it through. With no other choice, Dazzler blasted both of them into the gateway. Rogue was lost.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 246|247}} Suffering from an existential crisis, Longshot left the X-Men. Soon after, the psychotic super-villain known as [[Nanny (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Nanny]] attacked the X-Men at their base, in a confrontation where Havok accidentally killed Storm. The X-Men were down to only Havok, Dazzler, Colossus, and Psylocke.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 248}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 251 001.png|right|thumb|125px|Psylocke casts the Siege Perilous]]
Next, Havok received a distress call from Polaris, seemingly free from Malice. Under the leadership of Psylocke, they went to the Savage Land to retrieve her. There, they were attacked by Magneto's former mutates, now led by [[Zala Dane (Earth-616)|Zaladane]]. For the moment, the X-Men managed to evade Zaladane and save Polaris. During their period on the Savage Land, Psylocke telepathically discovered that the Reavers had planned for revenge for months. Now commanded by Donald Pierce and having [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]] joined to their ranks, if they battled the X-Men again, they would be successful in murdering them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 249|250}} To save the remaining X-Men from certain death, Psylocke convinced her teammates to pass through the Siege Perilous, even having to telepathically force Havok in doing so. Though the Reavers managed to capture was Wolverine, the X-Men were lost to the world, effectively finished.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 251}}

===X-Men: Reassembled===
Meanwhile, Polaris boarded a freighter to travel back home after being extirped from her powers by Zaladane. She managed to contact Muir Island for help, leading Banshee to rescue her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 253}} Banshee was then joined by [[Amanda Sefton (Earth-616)|Amanda Sefton]] and [[Alysande Stuart (Earth-616)|Brigadier Alysande Stuart]], who at the time were looking for Excalibur. Though the Reavers had lost track of the X-Men, they still were eager for revenge, directing their rage towards the Muir Island's residents. Their first victim was Banshee, who was shot and incapacitated. Moira haphazardly assembled an interim group of X-Men was formed to protect the mutants living on Muir Island from the Reavers, composed of Polaris, Sefton, Stuart, [[Sharon Friedlander (Earth-616)|Sharon Friedlander]] and [[Thomas Corsi (Earth-616)|Tom Corsi]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 254}} Val Cooper dispatched Forge and Mystique's Freedom Force to assist Moira in deflecting Pierce's attack. During the conflict and through the undermining of an insane [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]], Morlock [[Mark Hallett (Earth-616)|Sunder]] and Freedom Force agents [[Louis Hamilton (Earth-616)|Stonewall]] and [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny]] were killed. The surviving heroes managed to overpower the Reavers. Following the end of the conflict and Polaris' claims the X-Men were alive, Banshee recruited '''Forge''' to find and reform the former X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 255}}

[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 251 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Wolverine is tortured by the Reavers]]
Wolverine was tortured by the Reavers for days, until being freed by [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|'''Jubilee''']], a mutant kid with fireworks powers who had been secretly living at the X-Men's base for weeks. Together, Wolverine and Jubilee escaped the Reavers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 251|252}} In [[Hong Kong]], Wolverine and Jubilee learned that the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]] consolidated his control over Hong Kong's criminal scene by allying himself with the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]]. As they went to investigate, they were ambushed and captured by Mandarin's prime assassin, Lady Mandarin. It was then revealed that Lady Mandarin was actually Psylocke, brainwashed mind and soul and transferred into an Asian body by [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba (Earth-616)|Matsu'o Tsurayaba]]. After Psylocke established a mental link with Wolverine upon attacking him with her psychic knife, the backlash of memories of the X-Men broke her free, leading the Mandarin's defeat.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 256}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 258|258]]}}

Forge and Banshee arrived at the X-Mansion ruins while looking for clues about the X-Men whereabouts, where they found Jean Grey, who was attacked by a new group of villainous Morlocks led by [[Masque (Earth-616)|Masque]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 261}} One of the Morlocks' targets was Callisto, who at the time was involved with an amnesiac Colossus. Forge, Banshee and Jean Grey teamed up with Callisto and Colossus to put an end to Masque's jests.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 262}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 263|263]]}} The group, now joined by the Beast, was then drawn into a conflict against the Genoshan [[Press Gang (Earth-616)|Press Gang]]. They attempted to recapture Jenny Ransome, who lived with Colossus' flat in New York City after he became a popular artist in Soho.

Surprisingly, Storm had survived, being permanently de-aged by Nanny and living on the streets of [[Cairo (Illinois)|Cairo]] as a teenage thief, where she was recognized by the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]], who sent his “Hounds” after her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 265}} Storm was saved from the Shadow King's clutches by the mysterious mutant thief known as [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 266}} For weeks, the two maintained a partnership, until being eventually found by Nanny. As they defeated her, Ororo's memories were returned and she decided to rejoin the X-Men, taking '''Gambit''' with her to the X-Mansion.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 267}}

===[[X-Tinction Agenda]]===
The partially regrouped team at the X-Mansion ruins were soon thrown another hurdle; Genoshan [[Magistrates (Earth-616)|Magistrates]] captured Storm and some of the New Mutants for crimes committed on the island by the X-Men. One of the attackers was Havok, who re-emerged from the Siege Perilous on Genosha.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 270}} Transported to Genosha by [[Cormick Grimshaw (Earth-616)|Pipeline]], the captives were brought before their true captor: [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]]. Once an X-Factor ally, Hodge actually despised mutants and made a deal with the demon N'astirh to become immortal, and came to take control of the nation, carrying out an [[X-Tinction Agenda]] against mutants. Learning of the kidnapping, X-Factor joined forces with the X-Men and the remaining New Mutants to rescue the hostages.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 95}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 60}} Meanwhile, Wolverine, Jubilee and Psylocke heard of their friend's fates ant traveled to Genosha. Jubilee took care of the rescued New Mutants, while Wolverine and Psylocke infiltrated Hodge's Citadel, only to be discovered by Havok. The X-Men and X-Factor fared no better, with both squads becoming captives. Meanwhile, Storm had taken [[Genegineer]] [[David Moreau (Earth-616)|David Moreau]], creator of the [[Genoshan Mutates|mutate]] process, hostage but was subdued by Hodge and forced to become a mutate, a process which returned her to adulthood.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 271}} When Havok witnessed Hodge torturing his brother Cyclops, his memories were returned undoing his brainwashing as a magistrate.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 61}}

A mock trial found the captured mutants guilty, and all were given the choice of being transformed into a mutate or die. They chose death, but Hodge first had to deal with the insurrection of the Genegineer, aware Hodge's actions were insane. Hodge killed the magistrate [[Wipeout (Earth-616)|Wipeout]] to force the mutant heroes to become powerless. Unbeknownst to Hodge, Moreau gave Storm the ability to return the mutants their gifts rather than into a mutate. Ororo then restored her teammates' abilities, and all escaped.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 272}} Concurrently, Moreau planted a bomb to destroy all laboratories within the citadel. Furious, Hodge killed the traitor, though the Genegineer was able to weaken him considerably.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 97}} The X-Men eventually found Hodge and destroyed him and his Citadel. The reunited mutants returned to Salem Center and began to rebuild the team that had been splintered for months.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 62}} As a result of the tragic and violent conflict, New Mutants' leader, [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], revamped the team as the more aggressive [[X-Force (Earth-616)|'''X-Force''']].{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 100}}

During the Genoshan incident, Rogue was sent to the Reavers' Australian base with her memory intact weeks after entering Siege Perilous. She soon realized she lacked the memories and the powers of Carol Danvers. Attacked by the Reavers, she was able to flee to the Savage Land using Gateway's powers. There, she was attacked by Ms. Marvel, and discovered the Siege Perilous had given both personalities within Rogue a body connected to a single lifeforce. Rogue was prepared to die, but Magneto intervened and killed Danvers, saving Rogue's life.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 269}} The two spent time in the Savage Land, allying themselves with Ka-Zar and S.H.I.E.L.D. against Zaladane. Though Magneto and Rogue became attracted to one another, their relationship ended before it had a chance to blossom once Magneto killed Zaladane in cold blood, something Rogue opposed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 274|275}}

===[[Muir Island Saga]]===
[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 275 Full Gatefold Remastered Cover.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The X-Men welcome Professor X back]]
Fully reformed, the X-Men unfortunately had no rest. As a result of Deathbird's machinations, the group was recruited by teleporter [[Lila Cheney (Earth-616)|Lila Cheney]], who claimed Xavier's life was at risk.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 274}} The X-Men reunited with the Starjammers and Professor X in [[Chandilar]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 275}} soon learning Xavier was replaced by a [[Charles Xavier (War Skrull) (Earth-616)|War Skrull]], as part of a Skrull scheme to control the Shi'ar throne, which explained Deathbird's call for help.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 276}} After the X-Men defeated the Skrulls and liberated Xavier and the Shi'ar throne, Xavier learned of the Shadow King's actions by accessing Storm's memories. He then decided to return to Earth as his old enemy returned.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 277}}

While the X-Men were in their adventures, the Shadow King concentrated his efforts on Moira, assembling mutants to her [[Muir Island X-Men (Earth-616)|Muir Island team]], building an army, consisting of [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]], [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]], [[Guido Carosella (Earth-616)|Guido]], and even Rogue and Colossus. The Shadow King had been spreading waves of hate around the globe, and used Polaris to absorb the negative emotional energy to empower himself to unthinkable levels. Professor X returned from his sojourn in space and sent to Muir Island to confront their oddly acting allies, where they were surprised and defeated by the Shadow King-controlled island residents.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 278}} Meanwhile, in Westchester, Professor X and [[Stephanie Hunter (Earth-616)|Stevie Hunter]] were attacked by a possessed Colossus.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 277|278}} Xavier found no way to break Shadow King's control over him other than erasing the Peter Nicholas personality completely.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 279}}

Professor X then asked his original students, X-Factor, to rescue the current X-Men and stop Shadow King's hate wave. On Muir Island, Shadow King used Legion as his human host after the current one was killed while Forge eluded possession and even freed some of his friends.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 69}} The remaining heroes in good mind were divided into three teams, focusing on an astral plane attack on Farouk with a second team defending Xavier from physical attacks and a third freeing Polaris and disrupting their enemies' nexus. Professor X was badly wounded during the battle, his legs broken and again confined to a wheelchair.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 280}} As the Shadow King disappeared, all five X-Factor members returned to the X-Men along with Rogue and Colossus; after many years the X-Men had finally reunited as one team.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 70}} The name [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|'''X-Factor''']] was appropriated by Val Cooper as a revamped mutant organization sanctioned by the government.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 71}}

===Blue and Gold===
Professor X rebuilt the X-Mansion and the X-Men, with the team larger than ever before, moved back to their former home. To remain effective as a group, the X-Men were divided into two squads: Blue, led by Cyclops, consisting of Beast, Wolverine, Rogue, Psylocke, and Gambit; and Gold, led by Storm, consisting of Jean Grey, Iceman, Archangel, and Colossus. Following the return of Magneto's activities, S.H.I.E.L.D. requested the X-Men to investigate. The Blue Squad battled Magneto and his new team, the [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]], in Genosha.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 1}} Discovering Moira had altered his DNA years ago when he was regressed to a toddler, Magneto questioned if his recent turn to heroics was a result of Moira's tampering or his own free will. He then forced Moira to brainwash the X-Men Blue Squad into joining his [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]] on [[Asteroid M]], a space station haven for mutants. To make matters worse, the American and Russian governments decided to use a plasma cannon on the space station to end the threat of Magneto once and for all.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 2}} Worried about their friends, the Gold Squad sneaked on board and rescued their teammates, while a traitorous [[Fabian Cortez (Earth-616)|Fabian Cortez]] abandoned Asteroid M and planned to sacrifice Magneto as a martyr, so mutants around the world would join him. Xavier tried to talk the Acolytes into escaping the doomed base with the X-Men, but Magneto and his followers instead stayed to die.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 3}}

The Blue Squad then was put into conflict after [[Arkady Gregorivich (Earth-616)|Omega Red]], a member of the Soviet Super Soldier program, attacked the X-Men at home and captured Wolverine. Following his kidnapping, Jubilee joined the Blue Squad. Omega Red had been sent by Matsu'o Tsurayaba, who also planned to regain his control over Psylocke, who took the opportunity to pretend to be still under the Hand's brainwashing. Wolverine's former teammates from [[Team X (Earth-616)|Team X]], [[Christoph Nord (Earth-616)|Maverick]] and Sabretooth, also joined the conflict. With the help of Omega Red, the X-Men successfully defeated their enemies after Psylocke revealed her true allegiances and rescued Wolverine.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 4}}-[[X-Men Vol 2 7|7]]}}

Their next adventure ensued after Gambit's wife, [[Bella Donna Boudreaux (Earth-616)|Belladonna]], demanded his help with a conflict between the [[Thieves Guild (Earth-616)|Thieves Guild]] and the [[Assassins Guild (Earth-616)|Assassins Guild]] in [[New Orleans]]. Belladonna's arrival shoke off Gambit's recent relationship with his teammate, Rogue. As the X-Men investigated the matter, they learned that the Brood was behind the conflict between the Guilds. With the help of the [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]], the problem was solved.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 8}}-[[X-Men Vol 2 9|9]]}}{{r|{{cl|Ghost Rider Vol 3 26}}-[[Ghost Rider Vol 3 27|27]]}}

Following a rebellion on Mojoworld, Dazzler, Longshot and Lila Cheney contacted the X-Men Blue Team to assist them in dethroning Mojo. Captured, the X-Men were forced to be actors in Mojo's television system as Professor X was tortured by the mad tyrant. With the combined efforts of the X-Men and the rebels of the Mojoworld, Longshot "canceled" Mojo.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 10}}-[[X-Men Vol 2 11|11]]}} Soon after, the X-Men helped Professor X deal with a friend from his infancy, the mutant known as [[Carter Ryking (Earth-616)|Hazard]].{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 12}}-[[X-Men Vol 2 13|13]]}}

Meanwhile, the Gold Squad began their tenure attending a party at the Hellfire Club thrown by Emma Frost, who had asked for their help after an attempt on her life and other assaults against members of the Club. Before long, [[Trevor Fitzroy (Earth-1191)|Trevor Fitzroy]], a mutant from the future, personally attacked Frost and her Hellions and sent Sentinels to kill Donald Pierce in Australia. Pierce forced Gateway to teleport him out of harm's way to Fitzroy's location, but the Sentinels managed to folllow them through the portal, resulting in them seemingly killing Frost, Pierce, and Jean Grey.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 281}} Back at the X-Mansion, Xavier realized Jean's consciousness had been relocated to Emma Frost's body. Fitzroy, alongside with [[Shinobi Shaw (Earth-616)|Shinobi Shaw]], were revealed to be members of the [[Upstarts (Earth-616)|Upstarts]], who competed in a contest of murder run by the [[Gamesmaster (Earth-616)|Gamesmaster]]. Jean Grey surprised her captors and escaped with the X-Men. As Fitzroy tried to bring allies from the future, [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]], his archnemesis, arrived instead.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 282}} Though the Upstarts escaped, the X-Men survived. As Jean's mind returned to her body, a comatose Emma Frost was left in the care of the X-Men, and Bishop was on the loose.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 283}}

On their way home, the Gold team received a distress call from Sunfire, concerning a bizarre extra-dimensional rift in the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 284}} While investigating the rift, the X-Men were dragged to another dimension, where they found Colossus' older brother, [[Mikhail Rasputin (Earth-616)|Mikhail]], who had disappeared years before when he was a Soviet cosmonaut.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 285}} With Mikhail's and Sunfire's help, the X-Men sealed the portal and returned to the X-Mansion.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 286}} The Gold squad then turned their attentions back to Bishop, who had been responsible for a destruction path as he tried to locate Fitzroy. The X-Men captured Bishop after a chaotic battle and, to their surprise, Professor X made '''Bishop''' an X-Man. As an X-Man and a time-traveler from the future, Bishop revealed the X-Men would soon be betrayed by one of their own.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 287|288}}

Following Masque's recent apparent death, the Morlocks attempted to force Callisto to lead them again. Heavily injured, she sought refuge at the X-Mansion.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 291}} As the Gold team covered the Morlock Tunnels, Mikhail deceivingly joined forces with Callisto, gravely injuring Iceman and claiming the Morlocks' leadership for himself.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 292}} In a violent conflict with the X-Men, Mikhail decided to flood the tunnels, taking the Morlocks to another dimension in the process, much to Colossus' disappointment.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 293}}

===[[X-Cutioner's Song]]===
When giving a speech about mutant-human coexistence during a Lila Cheney peace concert, Professor X was shot by X-Force's leader, Cable, being infected with a [[Techno-Organic Virus|techno-organic virus]]. Simultaneously, Cyclops and Jean Grey were abducted by the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horsemen of Apocalypse]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 294}} They were delivered to Mister Sinister, who was disguised as Apocalypse unbeknownst to the Horsemen and handed the couple over to the [[Mutant Liberation Front (Earth-616)|MLF]] in exchange for a mysterious container. The X-Men Blue Team joined [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] in arresting [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] for information on Cable's whereabouts. Meanwhile, MLF's leader [[Nathaniel Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]] was revealed to be behind the attacks on Xavier and on Cyclops and Jean Grey by impersonating Cable.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 84}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 14}}{{r|X-Force Vol 1 16}}

[[File:Jean Grey (Earth-616) and Jubilation Lee (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 303 001.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Jean Grey comforting Jubilee after Illyana's death]]
Following Stryfe's defeat, Colossus' family was targeted by the Russian government, who wanted to recruit his younger sister, [[Illyana Rasputin (Earth-616)|Illyana]], to destroy the menacing [[Soul Skinner (Earth-616)|Soul Skinner]]. With the efforts of the X-Men Blue Team, Illyana was rescued, though they could not save Colossus' parents.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 18}}-[[X-Men Vol 2 19|19]]}} Though orphaned, Illyana was apparently safe at the X-Mansion, until it was revealed she was one of the first to contract the terminal Legacy Virus, severely affecting the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 300|303}}

Next, the X-Men were confronted by the mysterious [[Kwannon (Earth-616)|Revanche]], who accused Psylocke of being an impostor, claiming to be the real Betsy Braddock prior to her entrance in the Siege Perilous.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 20}} The X-Men Blue Team went to Japan to verify Revanche's claims. After battling the Silver Samurai, [[Nyoirin Henecha (Earth-616)|Lord Nyoirin]], and Matsu'o Tsurayaba, they returned with few answers and '''Revanche''' joined to the team.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 21|24}} Revanche came to be the first X-Men to fell ill to the Legacy Virus.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 2 2}} Before succumbing to the disease, she discovered her body was swiped with Psylocke in a bizarre plot by Spiral.

Meanwhile, the X-Men Gold team was trapped by a set of illusions cast by Mastermind, who was on the verge of death for being afflicted by the Legacy Virus. At the same time, they were attacked by the [[Carl Denti (Earth-616)|X-Cutioner]], an anti-mutant FBI agent who had access to equipment that the X-Men confiscated from alien races inherited from Fred Duncan and acted as a vigilante, having Wyngarde as his target. As Wyngarde died in the arms of Jean Grey, his illusions faded, and X-Cutioner managed to escape the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 1 17}}

===[[Fatal Attractions]]===
Obsessed with Magneto's teachings, the Acolytes, under Cortez's rule, were more aggressive than before, being responsible for terrorist attacks against humanity. The X-Men were surprised to see the Acolytes active and tried to stop their harmful activities. However, the fight between the two groups only incited more fear towards mutants.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 298}} Unbeknownst to the Acolytes, Cortez was secretly colluding with the Upstarts.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 299}} After the Acolytes captured Moira, the X-Men decided to attack their castle in order to save her.

Soon after, during a trip to the Savage Land, Professor X, Cyclops, and Storm were attacked by the Upstart [[Siena Blaze (Earth-616)|Siena Blaze]].

[[File:Charles Xavier (Earth-616) and Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 25 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Professor X shuts Magneto's mind down]]
Magneto then prepared an all-out war on humanity upon learning the Magneto Protocols, a plan to alter the Earth's electromagnetic field to inhibit his powers, had been activated. The rest of the X-Men stood by their mentor and attacked Magneto on his new space base when he began sending massive E.M.P. waves around the globe. During the fight, Magneto ripped the [[Adamantium|adamantium]] laced onto Logan's skeleton out of his body leaving him near death. Unable to deal with his old friend's violence any longer, Xavier shut down Magneto's mind, leaving him catatonic. Colossus stayed with his leader, vowing to care for him until he healed.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 25}}

Cortez, desperate after losing the power he once had as the leader of the Acolytes, brought chaos to Genosha, inciting a mutant revolution by kidnapping Magneto's granddaughter, [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 368}} Quicksilver asked for the X-Men's help in rescuing his daughter.

Gravely wounded by Magneto's attack, Wolverine chose to leave the X-Men.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 75}} Ironically, he was somehow replaced by his archnemesis Sabretooth, who was a hostage of his own savage powers, leading him to ask for the X-Men's help to control his bestial tendencies. Xavier took Sabretooth to the mansion, keeping him locked in the Danger Room.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 3}} Sabretooth's presence in the school caused much distress to the X-Men, especially Gambit, whom Sabretooth claimed to had a common past with.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 33}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 38}} Meanwhile, among so much conflict in their lives, the X-Men had a moment of joy at the wedding of Cyclops and Jean Grey.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 30}}

===[[Phalanx Covenant]]===
Around this period, the X-Men experienced several encounters with the mysterious [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]], a techno-organic race bent on ruling the world, who consumed organic matter, incorporating it to its collective consciousness.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 305|306}} In one of their attacks to the X-Men, Emma Frost inadvertently woke up from her coma in Iceman's body.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 311|313}} Confused and believing herself to be a prisoner of the X-Men, she tried to escape, using Iceman's powers in unprecedented ways.

[[File:Sean Cassidy (Earth-616) and Harvest (Maurd) (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 37.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Banshee saves the next generation from the Phalanx]]
Not long after, the Phalanx took over the X-Mansion and assumed the form of various X-Men. Banshee managed to escape along with the captive Sabretooth, a recovering Emma Frost, and the youngest X-Man, Jubilee.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 316}} They learned the Phalanx were after the next generation of mutants, hoping to experiment and eventually absorb the young mutants into their collective.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 36}} Joined by the young [[Everett Thomas (Earth-616)|Everett Thomas]], they saved the targeted young mutants, but only with the sacrifice of the young [[Clarice Ferguson (Earth-616)|Blink]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 317}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 37}} The surviving teenage mutants became [[Generation X (Earth-616)|'''Generation X''']], being taught by Banshee and Frost at the [[Massachusetts Academy]].

===[[Age of Apocalypse]]===
When Legion woke up from his coma with his fragmented mind healed, he planned to travel back in time to kill Magneto, his father's greatest enemy. The X-Men Bishop, Storm, Iceman, and Psylocke traveled back in time to stop him, but were unsuccessful. As Legion fired a powerful psi-blast at Magneto, Charles Xavier sacrificed himself to save his friend. With Xavier dead, reality was rewritten. Only Bishop, a temporal anomaly, remained unaffected.{{r|Legion Quest}} Legion's actions were devastating. Noticing the mutant energies during Xavier's murder, Apocalypse carried on his world domination years earlier than he would have otherwise, conquering most of a world known as the [[Earth-295|Age of Apocalypse]]. In this dystopian reality, the [[X-Men (Earth-295)|X-Men]] were founded by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and acted as freedom fighters. Although they suffered many casualties, the X-Men were able to send Bishop back in time to stop Legion and restore reality to normal. However, the crisis had many consequences since some individuals crossed over to the regular timeline.{{r|Age of Apocalypse (Event)}}{{r|X-Men Prime Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Ororo Munroe (Earth-616) and Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 325 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Storm rips Marrow's heart out]]
During the crisis, the conflicting couple Rogue and Gambit had additional problems after they shared their first kiss,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 41}} as Rogue absorbed some of Gambit's darkest memories.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 323|324}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 45}} Meanwhile, Cable had his X-Force relocated to the X-Mansion, promoting his field leader [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|'''Cannonball''']] to the X-Men.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 44}} On Avalon, the Acolytes made contact with [[Nemesis (Earth-295)|Holocaust]], one of the escapees from the Age of Apocalypse. Holocaust ravaged Avalon slaying many of the Acolytes, who were assisted by the X-Men Cyclops and Jean Grey (who had adopted the codename Phoenix).{{r|X-Men Vol 2 42|44}} Following the fall of Avalon, the past came to haunt the X-Men. This time in the form of the mutant terrorist group known as [[Gene Nation (Earth-616)|Gene Nation]], led by the ruthless [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]]. The Gene Nation members were descendants of the Morlocks who Mikhail transported from Earth. Now returned, they orchestrated a massive terrorist attack in retaliation for the Morlock Massacre. The X-Men were alerted by Colossus and Callisto and were able to stop the Gene Nation after Storm was forced to murder Marrow, by ripping her heart out.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 323|325}}

Other two interlopers from the Age of Apocalypse, namely [[Henry McCoy (Earth-295)|Dark Beast]] and [[Sugar Man (Earth-295)|Sugar Man]], were afraid that Bishop might recognize and expose their existence, especially to Mister Sinister, whom they feared the most.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 48}} To eliminate him, they had hired the assassin [[Fatale (Earth-616)|Fatale]] to seduce and kill Bishop. As Bishop noticed Fatale was a threat, she engaged in a fight with the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 49}} During this fight, '''Dark Beast''' realized the best way to hide was simply assimilating his counterpart's identity as a member of the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 10}} Dark Beast kept the real Beast captive secretly, while acting as a member of the X-Men. During a mission, Dark Beast, Bishop, and Gambit were captured by Sinister, much to Dark Beast despair.

===[[Onslaught (Event)|Onslaught]]===
The X-Men kept receiving hints about a malicious villain named [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]] for days. First, they found Juggernaut severely beaten in [[New Jersey]]. As Juggernaut came to his sense, he was terrified of the mysterious Onslaught.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 322}} Next, one of Onslaught's minions, [[Kevin Tremain (Earth-616)|Post]], forced some of the X-Men so he could test them for his master.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 50}} Onslaught first direct strike to the X-Men happened when he psychically attacked Phoenix, in an failed attempt to recruit her to his cause.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 53}} Following the attack, Juggernaut went to the X-Mansion to offer his help against the Onslaught.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 334}} Suspicious of her own teammates, Phoenix worked alone with Juggernaut, probing into his memories. Horrified, she discovered Onslaught's true identity: Charles Xavier.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 54}} Onslaught was the result of Professor X shutting Magneto's mind down months earlier, Magneto's anger combined with Xavier's repressed negativity resulted in his birth. Knocking the X-Men out at the X-Mansion, Onslaught turned his attentions to two powerful mutants he had interest in, [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]] from the Fantastic Four, and [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]], another traveler from the Age of Apocalypse who had alerted the Avengers about Onslaught.{{r|Onslaught X-Men Vol 1 1}}

Onslaught intended to unleash his fury over the human race, ordering Dark Beast to find him lackeys to achieve his goals.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 335}} Dark Beast and his [[Dark Descendants (Earth-616)|Dark Descendants]] hacked an army of Sentinels, setting them loose on New York City, to capture mutants and other super-humans.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 125}} Soon after, the real Beast was found and freed by X-Factor.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 126}} Meanwhile, Onslaught succeeded in kidnapping Frankling Richards,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 415}} using his powers to create a citadel on [[Central Park]], causing most prominent super-heroes of the world to unite in order to stop him.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 55}} Concurrently, Rogue discovered the enigmatic [[Joseph (Earth-616)|'''Joseph''']], an amnesiac and rejuvenated Magneto,{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 11}} bringing him to the Avengers{{r|Avengers Vol 1 401}} and ultimately to the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 55}}

A first strike by the combined might of the Avengers, Fantastic Four, and the X-Men allowed Thor to free Xavier from Onslaught, who was left as psionic energy contained within special armor.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 336}} No longer restricted by Xavier, Onslaught captured Nate Grey.{{r|X-Man Vol 1 19}} As he assessed Grey's memories about the Age of Apocalypse, Onslaught realized that neither humans nor mutants deserve to rule the world, choosing to obliterate both races instead.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 56}} Jean Grey telepathically aided the Hulk in destroying Onslaught's armor. Thor then proceeded to slash at the now unprotected psionic energy being and managed to damage him. Surmising mutants would only empower Onslaught, the non-mutant members of the Avengers and Fantastic Four successfully destroyed Onslaught by sacrificing their own lives. In actuality, Franklin Richards had used his reality-warping powers to transport them to a [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|pocket universe]]. No one discovered the true fate of the heroes for a while, and in the meantime anti-mutant hysteria erupted into chaos as most of the Earth's super-heroes perished when battling a mutant menace.{{r|Onslaught Marvel Universe Vol 1 1}} Professor Xavier chose to leave his X-Men,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 337}} being taken into federal custody.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 57}}

However, Mystique's real intentions were more sinister; she had tampered with the [[Legacy Virus]] to release a strain that would only infect regular humans. On Muir Island, Moira had finally discovered a cure of the virus, but Mystique mortally wounded her. Mystique even stabbed Rogue to keep the cure hidden, yet Rogue recovered quickly enough and subdued her.{{r|Bishop the Last X-Man Vol 1 16}} Professor Xavier was able to transfer Moira's knowledge of the virus to his mind before she seemingly died.

With the Legacy Virus cured, the Genoshan Mutates were healthy enough for Magneto to amass a superpowered army. Without enough X-Men around to stop him, Magneto was successful in capturing Xavier,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 111}} whom he brought to Genosha on the eve of his invasion. Cyclops and Wolverine infiltrated the island nation as Jean Grey recruited a team of X-Men formed by ex-Alpha Flight member [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|'''Northstar''']], [[Hector Rendoza (Earth-616)|'''Wraith''']], [[Paul Provenzano (Earth-616)|'''Paulie Provenzano''']], Sunfire's sister [[Leyu Yoshida (Earth-616)| '''Sunpyre''']], and mentally controlled Acolyte [[Joanna Cargill (Earth-616)|'''Joanna Cargill''']] a.k.a.

In [[Wild Sentinel Factory|a factory]] in [[Ecuador]], Nova activated a forgotten [[Master Mold]] using the Trask DNA, manufacturing immense [[Wild Sentinels|wild Sentinels]] to attack Genosha. Magneto, incapacitated from Wolverine's attack, could do nothing but watch as the entire island along with sixteen million mutants were exterminated.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 114|115}} One of the few survivors from the massacre found by the X-Men was '''Emma Frost''', due to her sudden new diamond form powers. Nova was brought into custody by Cyclops and Wolverine, but managed to break free, secretly switching bodies with Xavier.

When one of its operatives, [[Gloria Muñoz (Earth-616)|Risque]], was killed in Hong Kong, the X-Men teamed up with her partner, [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]], to investigate. There, they learned of the existence of [[Sublime (Earth-616)|John Sublime]]'s mutant organ harvesters, the [[U-Men (Earth-616)|U-Men]].

Meanwhile, Xorn cured the X-Men of the nano-sentinel infection, effectively joining the Xavier's School staff. With the efforts of the X-Men, mutantkind was safe.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 126}}

Meanwhile, the X-Treme X-Men kept having their fates directed by Destiny's diaries. When Gambit was framed for having murdered [[Miles Warbeck (Earth-616)|Viceroy]], an Australian crime-lord, the X-Men went to Sydney to investigate. They were assisted by [[Paul Hark (Earth-616)|Red Lotus]] and [[Teri Baltimore (Earth-616)|Teri Baltimore]] in clearing Gambit's name.

Meanwhile, the Xavier Institute became a sanctuary to surviving powered mutants, who became known as the [[198 (Earth-616)|'''198''']]. At a time when the X-Men were needed the most, Storm decided to stay in Africa to aid mutants in need and the X.S.E. ceased to be. The M-Day also was the catalyst for the reformulation of [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|'''X-Factor Investigations''']] and the return of the British mutant group Excalibur.

With Belasco dead, Illyana sent her former friends back to Earth, choosing to remain on Limbo as its new ruler.{{r|{{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 37}}-[[New X-Men Vol 2 41|41]]}}

[[File:X-Men Vol 2 194 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The X-Men go Rogue]]
Unexpectedly, Sabretooth arrived at the Xavier Institute asking for refuge, escaping from the deadly [[Children of the Vault (Earth-616)|Children of the Vault]], [[Homo novissima|artificially evolved post-humans]] who became active after the M-Day.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 188}} The Children of the Vault, aiming to eliminate Sabretooth to keep their existence secret, sent Northstar and [[Jeanne-Marie Beaubier (Earth-616)|Aurora]] to ambush the Xavier Institute, though they were fended off with the help of Cable.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 189|190}} Rogue was then assigned a team to stop the Children of the Vault, recruiting '''Mystique''', Iceman, Cannonball, and Cable for her mission. Lady Mastermind and [[Karima Shapandar (Earth-616)|Karima Shapandar]], an '''Omega Sentinel''', who had been recently rescued by Rogue from an illegal mental institution, also joined the group. The last member was '''Sabretooth''' himself. Rogue's team was successful in destroying the Children of the Vault before they could reach the Xavier's. The new X-Men group then decided to leave the institute and follow their own agenda.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 192|193}} Their first action was to rehabilitate Northstar and Aurora from their brainwashing in a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier. There, the X-Men were confronted by Exodus' new Acolytes. As Exodus realized the enormous consequences of the M-Day, he ceased his attack and fled.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 3 1}}

Rogue's next objective was to track Lady Mastermind's and Omega Sentinel's captor, a man known as [[Richard Palance (Earth-616)|Pandemic]], who had a special interest in Rogue's replicating powers. Left powerless by Sabretooth, he still managed to infect Rogue with a viral agent that rendered her powers more lethal than ever, leaving her on the brink of death.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 194|196}} Cable sought to treat Rogue on his island nation [[Providence (Island)|Providence]]. Unfortunately, the island was attacked by the [[Hecatomb (Earth-616)|Hecatomb]], a Shi'ar mind devouring bomb that followed [[Ev Teel Urizen (Earth-616)|Urizen]], a mummudrai who had possessed Lady Mastermind, to Earth. The Hecatomb annihilated Providence, but was ultimately deactivated by Rogue, who absorbed all of its minds. The attack allowed Sabretooth to furtively escape, and Rogue was left in severely poor condition, both physically and psychically.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 197|199}}

[[File:X-Men Vol 2 200 Left Textless.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The X-Men are tricked by the Marauders]]
At Mystique's house, other X-Men were assembled to stabilize Rogue's condition. There, they were ambushed by Mister Sinister's Marauders, who had been targeting any being with knowledge about the future, including Rogue, who had read Destiny's Diaries. Mystique, Lady Mastermind and Omega Sentinel (recently possessed by Malice) revealed to be Marauders, who heavily outnumbered the X-Men. With the X-Men defeated, Rogue was kidnapped. On Providence, Cable was seemingly killed by Gambit and Sunfire.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 200}} Moreover, the Acolytes, subordinated to Mister Sinister, attacked the X-Mansion to collect Destiny's Diaries and kill the precognitive mutant [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]], being unsuccessful in their mission. The X-Men, though massively fractured by the attacks, were able to survive mostly due to Mystique's and Gambit's misleading behavior.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 201|204}}

When Caliban was brutally assaulted by Masque and his Morlocks, he asked for help at the X-Mansion, leading Storm to rejoin the X-Men. Leading a team comprising Warpath, ex-Starjammer '''[[Hepzibah (Earth-616)|Hepzibah]]''' and '''Caliban''', Storm infiltrated the sewers of Manhattan to stop Masque's extremist terrorist attacks. The mission led them to learn about the visions of the late Morlock [[Qwerty (Earth-616)|Qwerty]]. Concurrently, Xavier and Nightcrawler learned that Magneto was secretly active and had a role to play in the upcoming future of mutantkind.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 487|491}}

[[File:Scott Summers (Earth-616) from Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 17 0001.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Cyclops breaks free from Cassandra Nova's illusion]]
Emma Frost's trick on Cassandra Nova years before proved to create nefarious consequences. Nova had planted a suggestion on Frost's mind that grew to a more robust mind control. Under Nova's influence, Frost telepathically tormented the X-Men with a series of illusions related to the Hellfire Club, ultimately turning Cyclops' powers off. Kitty Pryde was the most affected victim, since Frost forced her to believe the alien Stuff, where Nova was trapped, was actually a child she had had with Colossus. Before Nova could achieve her goal of breaking free from Stuff's body, [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]]'s director [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]] abducted the X-Men, Danger and Ord to her spaceship, where Frost was out of Nova's reach.{{r|{{cl|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 13}}-[[Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 18|18]]}}

[[File:Katherine Pryde (Earth-616) from Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Kitty Pryde saves Earth at the cost of her own freedom]]
Brand, in need of super-heroes, explained that Ord's leader, [[Kruun (Earth-616)|Lord Kruun]] of the [[Breakworld]], intended to eliminate Earth due to a prophecy that claimed Colossus would destroy the Breakworld, justifying Ord's former involvement with Genetech.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 19}} Upon reaching the Breakworld, the X-Men were relentlessly attacked, being scattered all over the alien planet. Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Wolverine and new recruit [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|'''Armor''']] were the most afflicted by the attacks.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 20}} Kitty and Colossus were met and helped by [[Aghanne (Earth-616)|Aghanne]], the leader of the Breakworlder revolution. Meanwhile, Cyclops and Frost were ambushed by Danger.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 21}} Frost managed to convince Danger to aid the X-Men, while Beast and Brand learned Kruun had a gigantic missile aimed at Earth. Cyclops, Wolverine and Armor deceived Kruun's forces, by being intentionally captured. Another deception involved Cyclops pretending to have lost his powers, which guaranteed him the opportunity to incapacitate Kruun.{{r|{{cl|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 22}}-[[Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 23|23]]}} With Kruun accounted for, Kitty phased into the missile in order to disable it, only to discover it was actually [[Retaliator|a giant bullet]]. The bullet was ultimately fired at Earth with Kitty trapped inside it.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 24}} On the Breakworld, the X-Men learned Aghanne fabricated the prophecy in order to destroy a world she despised, built in suffering and pain. She was ultimately killed by her own rage, failing to destroy the Breakworld. Meanwhile, the X-Men and other Earth's heroes were not able to detain the bullet. In the last moment, Kitty Pryde used her powers to phase the bullet through Earth, effectively preventing the planet's destruction. However, the bullet kept moving in a straight line; Kitty was lost in outer space.{{r|Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men Vol 1 1}}

===[[Messiah Complex]]===
[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 493 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cable protects the mutant messiah]]
When the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|first mutant]] birth since M-Day occurred, Cerebra registered a powerful spike. The X-Men jumped to the Alaskan town of [[Cooperstown]] only to find that the Marauders and the Purifiers had beaten them to it.{{r|X-Men: Messiah Complex Vol 1 1}} As the X-Men tracked the Acolytes to learn the location of Mister Sinister's hideout, [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] from X-Factor Investigations infiltrated the Purifiers. Meanwhile, Multiple Man and Layla Miller were sent to the future to research about the mutant messiah.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 492}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 25}} The X-Men arrived at Mister Sinister's facility on Antarctica, while Rictor, allied with the New X-Men, discovered the Purifiers were working with Lady Deathstrike and her Reavers. Neither the Marauders, the Acolytes, the Purifiers or the Reavers had the baby.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 44}} The X-Men and the New X-Men were massacred by their enemies, partially because, during their missions, the O*N*E Sentinels were hijacked by an unknown assailant, destroying the X-Mansion. However, before the X-Men escaped from the Marauders, Gambit revealed to Wolverine the messiah's whereabouts: she was rescued by a very much alive Cable.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 205}}

In order to retrieve the baby from Cable, Cyclops assigned to Wolverine the command of a new [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|'''X-Force''']], a strike force team composed of tracker killers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 493}} The Reavers managed to find Cable before the X-Men could, and attempted to eliminate him and the baby.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 26}} The conflict was interrupted by X-Force, who rescued Cable and the baby, at the cost of Caliban's life. Distrustful, Cable stole X-Force's Blackbird, once again running loose with the baby by himself.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 45}} On the future, the Multiple Man met a young Bishop, learning about his feelings of hate towards the mutant messiah: the traitor who destroyed the X-Mansion was revealed to be an X-Man. Bishop found Cable in Forge's Eagle Plaza, easily subduing him and having the baby at his mercy.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 206}}

[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 207 001.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Cyclops disbands the X-Men following the apparent death of Charles Xavier at the hands of Bishop]]
Before Bishop could take any action, he was ambushed by the Marauders, who kidnapped the baby.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 494}} The Marauders' track led the X-Men to Muir Island. At the same time, Cable sought help from Professor Xavier, and the duo also went to Muir Island.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 27}} As a deadly fight ensued, Mystique's and Gambit's motivations for their erratic behavior was revealed. After assassinating Mister Sinister and forcing the baby to touch Rogue, Mystique restored her daughter's mind and body, as predicted by Destiny. Meanwhile, a Predator X attacked Xavier's School, but before it could claim any kill, it was teleported to Muir Island by the New X-Man [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 46}} With Predator X being accounted for by Wolverine, and the Marauders being mostly dead, Cyclops decided to go on with Cable's intentions, handing the baby over to him so he could raise her on [[Earth-80521|the future]], where he could protect her. As Cable departed, Bishop attempted a last shot against the child, accidentally hitting Xavier in the head. With Xavier apparently dead, Cyclops disbanded the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 207}}

Professor Xavier's lifeless body was claimed by the Acolytes, who managed to revive him with the help of Magneto. Having his memories severely affected by his condition, Xavier went on a self-discovery journey without the knowledge of the X-Men.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 208}}-[[X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 210|210]]}} Though the X-Men were disbanded, Cyclops kept protecting what was left of mutantkind by secretly carrying on with the X-Force initiative, targeting members of the mutant-hating [[Human Council (Earth-616)|Human Council]], formed by Bastion, for assassination.{{r|{{cl|X-Force Vol 3 1}}-[[X-Force Vol 3 6|6]]}} He also tasked Wolverine with putting Mystique down for her betrayal.{{r|{{cl|Wolverine Vol 3 62}}-[[Wolverine Vol 3 65|65]]}} Meanwhile, Donald Pierce saw the X-Men's withdrawal as an opportunity to impersonate Cyclops and create [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|his own team of X-Men]]. Pierce manipulated his team into attacking the former New Mutants, but was ultimately unmasked and arrested for his crimes, unfortunately at the cost of [[Nicholas Gleason (Earth-616)|Wolf Cub]]'s life.{{r|{{cl|Young X-Men Vol 1 1}}-[[Young X-Men Vol 1 5|5]]}}

===San Francisco===
Dispersed all over the world, the former X-Men enjoyed their precious moment of calm after the storm. When Cyclops and Emma Frost, after a period of vacation in the Savage Land, went to San Francisco to meet other X-Men who had suddenly fallen out of contact, they witnessed odd events happening there. Eventually, they learned Martinique Wyngarde was behind a mental trap that deceived people into thinking they lived in a hippie community. When Cyclops and Frost confronted Wyngarde, they were forced to fight their fellow X-Men, brainwashed by her powers. As the X-Men subdued the villainess, they coincidentally rescued the mayor of the city, [[Sadie Sinclair (Earth-616)|Sadie Sinclair]], who offered the X-Men a safe haven in San Francisco. Cyclops then contacted Wolverine, Nightcrawler and Colossus, who had just fought Omega Red and the Red Room in Europe, to join them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 495|499}}

[[File:Scott Summers (Earth-616) and Emma Frost (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 500 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cyclops offers asylum to all mutants in San Francisco]]
On the outskirts of the city, the X-Men reestablished and built the [[Graymalkin Industries|X-Center]], funded by Angel's Mutantes Sans Frontières and politically promoted by Mayor Sinclair. In San Francisco, the X-Men experienced local acceptance and veneration. Under this new status quo, the team investigated an art installation where Sentinels were exhibited for mutant affectionate admirers. Unexpectedly, the X-Men were intercepted by an artificially repowered Magneto, a mere distraction to allow the High Evolutionary to access the [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|Dreaming Celestial]] without the X-Men's interference. After Magneto and the Evolutionary vanished, Emma Frost helped Cyclops sent a telepathic message to all mutants around the world stating that they now had a place they could call home in San Francisco, recreating the X-Men and Xavier's dream once again.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 500}}

[[File:New Mutants (Forge) (Earth-616) from Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 30 001.png|thumb|left|An insane Forge tries to create new mutants]]
Collaborating with the [[San Francisco Police Department (Earth-616)|SFPD]] and with Abigail Brand, the X-Men investigated bizarre mutant-related murders.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 25}} Their inspection led them to places such as [[Chaparanga|Chaparanga Beach]] and the Chinese hidden mutant city of [[Tian]], where they learned both about the existence of inter-dimensional portals known as [[Ghost Boxes]] and of fabricated artificial mutants.{{r|{{cl|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 26}}-[[Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 28|28]]}} The X-Men found out Forge, left insane after Bishop's attack and now based at the [[Wundagore Mountain]], was behind the bizarre events.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 29}} With the S.W.O.R.D.'s assistance, the X-Men destroyed Forge, his artificial mutants and his dangerous Ghost Box.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 30}} Next, the X-Men teamed up with Brand's S.W.O.R.D. again to ward off a deformed madman known as [[Kaga (Earth-616)|Kaga]], who made attacks on the X-Men weaponizing deceased mutants and the Brood as organic Sentinels.{{r|{{cl|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 31}}-[[Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 35|35]]}} Later on, the X-Men traveled to the village of [[Karere]] in [[Mbangawi]], where mutant births were reported. The children were revealed to be actually [[Warpies (Race)|Warpies]], who emerged due to the presence of an alternate [[James Jaspers (Earth-10083)|Jim Jaspers]]. Jaspers was followed by [[Fury (Earth-10083)|Furies]] from his reality. Helped by [[Joshua N'Dingi (Earth-616)|Doctor Crocodile]], the X-Men expelled the Furies back to their realities, while Jaspers was murdered by Doctor Crocodile, ceasing his warping effects on the newborns.{{r|{{cl|Astonishing X-Men: Xenogenesis Vol 1 1}}-[[Astonishing X-Men: Xenogenesis Vol 1 5|5]]}}

Though the X-Men benefited from the public acceptance in general – something exemplified by their efforts to save San Francisco from the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]] –,{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men Vol 1 1}} they still struggled with anti-mutant hate. After Pixie was brutalized by the [[Hellfire Cult (Earth-616)|Hellfire Cult]], the X-Men (who had [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|'''Karma''']] as their latest addition) stroke back.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 501}} They learned [[Manuel de la Rocha (Earth-616)|Empath]] led the Hellfire Cult.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 502}} The X-Men detained him after '''Pixie''' dealt the ultimate blow against her aggressor, joining the X-Men after that.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 503}}

[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616) and Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 2 2 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Emma Frost captures Sebastian Shaw]]
After the Skrull invasion, [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] was granted full control over the super-hero law enforcement powers. He invited Emma Frost to join his [[Cabal (Dark Illuminati) (Earth-616)|Cabal]] and represent mutants in his dark schemes.{{r|Secret Invasion: Dark Reign Vol 1 1}} Frost found in Namor, the Sub-Mariner, an ally inside Osborn's Cabal. With his help, she captured Sebastian Shaw, though Namor believed Shaw to have perished, a ruse orchestrated by Frost. Cyclops' and Frost's secrets, about the X-Force and the Cabal, proved to damage their relationship.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 2 2}} In San Francisco, Frost assisted Colossus in battling a ghost from his past, the [[Tattooed Man (Earth-616)|Tattooed Man]]. Meanwhile, Beast followed his own agenda, recruiting [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|'''Doctor Nemesis''']], [[Madison Jeffries (Earth-616)|'''Madison Jeffries''']], [[Yuriko Takiguchi (Earth-616)|'''Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi''']], and [[Kavita Rao (Earth-616)|'''Dr. Kavita Rao''']] for his own X-Men science team, the [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]], to research ways of reverting M-Day.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 504|508}}

Meanwhile, the X-Men were unexpectedly attacked by [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]] and her [[Sisterhood of Mutants (Earth-616)|Sisterhood]]. Pryor was behind the Hellfire Cult and targeted the X-Men both in seek of revenge for being abandoned and of being completely resurrected in a physical body. She retrieved Psylocke from the multiverse, resurrecting her as a test for Madelyne's own resurrection ritual.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 508}} Brainwashed by Madelyne, Psylocke assisted the Sisterhood in infiltrating the X-Center and retrieving a beacon for Jean Grey's body.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 509|510}} On the ruins of the X-Mansion, with the help of [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|'''Domino''']], the X-Men tricked Madelyne into being disincorporated. In San Francisco, Psylocke overcame her brainwashing and rejoined the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 511}}

Feeling the presence of her [[Soulsword]] within the X-Man Nightcrawler, Illyana Rasputin invaded the X-Center from Limbo with hopes of recovering part of her soul.{{r|X-Infernus Vol 1 1}} While Illyana was successful in retrieving her Soulsword from the X-Men, Belasco's daughter, [[Ananym (Earth-616)|Witchfire]], seized control of Limbo intending to liberate the [[Elder Gods]] from their enclosure.{{r|X-Infernus Vol 1 2}} Cyclops dispatched an X-Men team led by Colossus to bring Illyana back. On Limbo, most of the X-Men were controlled by Witchfire.{{r|X-Infernus Vol 1 3}} Joining forces with the X-Men, Illyana reconquered her rule over Limbo as Witchfire escaped.{{r|X-Infernus Vol 1 4}} As '''Magik''', Illyana assembled her former teammates from the New Mutants, Cannonball, '''Sunspot''' and [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|'''Magma''']] as a new group of X-Men to save Karma and '''Dani Moonstar''', who also joined the team. Karma and Moonstar had been subdued by a recently resurrected Legion, who was ultimately defeated and captured by the X-Men.{{r|{{cl|New Mutants Vol 3 1}}-[[New Mutants Vol 3 4|4]]}}

[[Simon Trask (Earth-616)|Simon Trask]], leader of the Humanity Now! coalition, leaked to the press the involvement of mutants in the Cooperstown massacre, inciting an anti-mutant sentiment against the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 504|507}} He proposed the [[Proposition X]] act, to regulate mutant births in San Francisco.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 509}} When Humanity Now! went on a march for their proposition, they were met by the mutant community led by Beast in San Francisco. The city erupted into a riot, and some mutants, including Beast, were arrested by the SFPD. Cyclops' X-Men and Norman Osborn's [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] intervened in the violent protests. As the two groups clashed, Osborn revealed to the media he was backed by Professor Charles Xavier, secretly Mystique in disguise. Cyclops and his X-Men retreated back to the X-Center, while, on the Alcatraz Prison, Beast learned Xavier’s true condition as Osborn's prisoner.{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia Vol 1 1}} Amidst this incident, Cyclops welcomed Rogue back to the X-Men, though she had the suspicious company of Gambit and '''Danger'''. Rogue and her friends were tasked to protect civilian lives in San Francisco, being assisted by [[Ariel (Coconut Grove) (Earth-616)|'''Ariel''']] under Cyclops' orders to fight Osborn's Avengers.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 226}}-[[X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 227|227]]}} Osborn dispatched an apparently traitorous Frost, now in charge of his own team of [[X-Men (Osborn) (Earth-616)|X-Men]], to control the mutant rioters, now led by Frost's former student, [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 513}}

With the rioters arrested, Frost learned that Beast and Xavier were being tortured by Dark Beast, who, under Osborn's order, used the [[Omega Machine]] to boost [[Michael Pointer (Earth-616)|Omega]]'s powers. In addition to this, another threat came in the form of Trask, who had infected the Humanity Now! coalition members, transforming them into biomechanical sentinels.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 7}} Trask's human sentinels went on a direct conflict with Osborn's X-Men. Meanwhile, Cyclops sent the X-Club to assess the remains of Asteroid M.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 514}} As Wolverine and his X-Force freed the prisoners on Alcatraz, Emma revealed her true allegiances to Cyclops' X-Men alongside '''Namor'''. With the ruins of Asteroid M revitalized by the X-Club, Cyclops relocated the X-Men to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], an island sovereign nation out of the American territory and Osborn's reach.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 8}} Betrayed by Frost and Namor, Osborn led his Avengers to Utopia. Cyclops, counting with the largest group of X-Men ever, was successful in fending Osborn off, though at the cost of Frost's mind being infected by the [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|Void]] after she mentally attacked the Avenger Sentry, permanently trapping her in her diamond form.{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Exodus Vol 1 1}}

Though free from Osborn, the X-Men immediately faced unfortunate surprises, such as the sudden death of Dr. Takiguchi and the arrival of Magneto to his former base.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 515}} Praising Cyclops for reuniting the mutant race on Utopia following their tragic decimation, Magneto revealed he had his mutant powers restored with the help of the High Evolutionary.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 516}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 507}} Though suspicious, the X-Men had no choice but to accept Magneto back into their ranks when the ex-Marauder [[John Greycrow (Earth-616)|Scalphunter]], blackmailed by the villain [[Lobe (Earth-616)|Lobe]], unleashed from a plane a macabre cargo: a bunch Predators X. With Magneto's help, the X-Men destroyed the Predators X and incarcerated Scalphunter on Utopia.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 517}} Meanwhile, one of the X-Men's young protégés, [[Roxanne Washington (Earth-616)|Bling!]], was kidnapped from Utopia by [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]].

Utopia was suddenly attacked by a horde of undead brainwashed mutants, many of them being former allies or foes of the X-Men. Selene was behind the bizarre resurrections using the [[Transmode Virus]], as part of a ritual to channel the souls of deceased mutants to empower her to godhood. She led her [[Inner Circle (Selene) (Earth-616)|Inner Circle]] to Genosha in order to raise millions of mutants from dead. On Utopia, the deceased member of the New Mutants, [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]], alongside the Hellions, manage to break the island's defences and allow the invasion of Selene's lackeys. Meanwhile, Blindfold was alerted by Destiny about a dire situation on the Muir Island.{{r|X-Necrosha Vol 1 1}} Cyclops dispatched a team led by Nightcrawler to the Muir Island, comprising Rogue, Magneto, Psylocke, Colossus, Husk, [[Hope Abbott (Earth-616)|'''Trance''']] and '''Blindfold'''. When Destiny was finally found, the X-Men learned she had been tricked by a resurrected Proteus, who was hidden inside her body.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 231}} Since most of the X-Men were possessed by Proteus, Rogue and Magneto had to combat their own teammates. As Rogue freed her friends from Proteus' control, Magneto ultimately destroyed him.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 232|233}}

On Utopia, Cypher personally attacked his former teammates, brutally maiming Magma. Unexpectedly, however, he came into contact with [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]], who disrupted Selene's influence.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 6}} Before Cypher could totally break free from his brainwashing, the Hellions captured him.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 7}} With the Hellions defeated, Magik purged Cypher from his infection using her Soulsword.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 8}} Both '''Cypher''' and '''Warlock''' joined Cannonball's X-Men squad.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 9}} As soon as the X-Men realized millions of Genoshan mutants had been resurrected,{{r|X-Force Vol 3 21}} Selene and her Inner Circle attacked Utopia personally, killing some of its residents and capturing Warpath.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 3 22}}-[[X-Men Vol 3 23|23]]}} X-Force followed Selene to Genosha, now renamed “Necrosha”, where she completed her ritual and ascended as a goddess.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 24}} Defeated by X-Force and with Warpath's final strike, Selene was slain, which released the souls she had consumed.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 25}}

Following this series of conflicts, the X-Men could finally attend to the Void fragment trapped inside Frost's mind. With Professor X's and Psylocke's help, Cyclops and Frost destroyed the fragment. Meanwhile, Magneto made a deal with Namor to build a New Atlantis city underneath Utopia, providing it support in order to prevent it to sink. Unable to adjust to life on Utopia under Cyclops' rule, after being tortured and realizing Magneto was gaining influence on the island, Beast decided to leave the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 518|519}}

As Cyclops learned about the existence of a surviving Predator X in New York City, a team went to investigate.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 520}} Joined by '''Fantomex''' and his partner [[E.V.A. (Earth-616)|'''E.V.A.''']], the X-Men found out Lobe and his [[Lobe's Team (Earth-616)|New U-Men]] were the schemers behind the Predator X attack on Utopia. Though Lobe escaped, the X-Men learned of his ties with John Sublime.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 521}} Meanwhile, on San Francisco, Magneto still did not have Cyclops' complete trust. To remedy that, he used his magnetic powers to rescue Kitty Pryde from the Breakworld's giant bullet, forcing it to return Earth. However, as she returned, Kitty was trapped in her intangible form and was kept in a containment cell.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 522}}

===[[Second Coming|The Return of Hope]]===
[[File:Nathan Summers (Earth-616) and Hope Summers (Earth-616) from X-Men Second Coming Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cable and Hope return to the present]]
Cable and the first mutant born after M-Day, now a teenage girl called Hope, finally managed to return to the present. As they arrived at the ruins of the X-Mansion, they were immediately attacked by the Right, under orders of Bastion's [[Human Council (Earth-616)|Human Council]]. As Cerebra registered Cable's signature, Cyclops led his alpha team of X-Men to assist him. The X-Men arrived just in time to confront the Sapien League, who were also after Cable and Hope under Bastion's orders. The brutality shown by Wolverine, X-23 and Archangel when dealing with the Sapiens League compromised X-Force's secret existence to the other X-Men.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming Vol 1 1}}

Even with the X-Men's trust on Cyclops shaken by this revelation, he kept coordinating several missions to ensure Hope's survival. He sent Cannonball's team to deal with Cameron Hodge. Meanwhile, the alpha team of X-Men found Cable and Hope hiding in a motel, now under the target of William Stryker's Purifiers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 523}} Once again, Cable and Hope managed to escape their assailants. The X-Men lost their teleporter Magik when the Purifiers successfully banished her to Limbo. The Purifiers were then obliterated by Archangel. Meanwhile, Cannonball's team was brutally massacred by Hodge.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 12}} Their survival was only possible due to Warlock killing Hodge and several members of the Right. To pursue Cable, the X-Men alpha team was joined by Rogue and Ariel. At the cost of Ariel's life, Cable and Hope met the X-Men. Escorted by Rogue and Nightcrawler, Hope started a journey across the country to reach Utopia as the rest of the X-Men and Cable fought the Human Council forces.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 235}} In [[Las Vegas]], the trio of runaways were welcomed by Bastion himself, who knocked Rogue out and fatally wounded Nightcrawler. At the moment of his death, Nighcrawler teleported Hope to Utopia.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 26}}

[[File:Kurt Wagner (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 3 26 0001.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Nightcrawler sacrifices himself to ensure Hope's survival]]
In order to rescue Magik, Cannonball led a team to Limbo, transported by Pixie. On Utopia, the X-Men mourned Nightcrawler while preparing to face Bastion.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 524}} The X-Men's last teleporter, Vanisher, was unexpectedly assassinated by Stephen Lang. Meanwhile, Donald Pierce, who had infiltrated in Utopia, destroyed the X-Men Blackbirds. With no teleporters or vehicles, the X-Men were trapped on Utopia.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 13}} Using a series of towers around Utopia, Bastion cast an energy dome to prevent the X-Men from leaving the San Francisco Bay. On the Golden Gate, Bastion opened a dimensional portal from the future, allowing Nimrod Sentinels access to the present.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 236}} Thousands of Nimrods coming out of the portal proved to be an unbeatable adversary. Using Cable's time-travel technology, Cyclops decided to send X-Force to the future to destroy the Nimrod factory.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 27}}

[[File:Hope Summers (Earth-616), Phoenix Force (Earth-616), and Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 3 28 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Hope destroys Bastion]]
As the X-Men struggled to contain the Nimrods, Cyclops asked Professor X work with Legion to help.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 525}} As Legion kept the Nimrods under relative control, X-Force reached the Master Mold responsible for creating the Nimrods in the future.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 14}} The X-Men were then joined by a recovered Magneto in fending the Nimrods off. As Cypher deactivated the Master Mold, the Nimrods stopped their invasion. However, X-Force had no way back to the present. As Cable allowed his body to be taken by the Techno-Organic Virus, he was able to transport X-Force through Bastion's portal.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 237}} At the cost of his own life, Cable saved X-Force. Tragically, the X-Men still had to combat a final foe, Bastion. Tormented by the death of the man who raised her, Hope had her power manipulation mutant abilities activated and used the X-Men's powers to disintegrate Bastion and his dome.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 28}} On Limbo, Cannonball's team rescued Magik, having to oppose N'astirh and Gambit's Death persona in the process.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Hellbound Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Men: Hellbound Vol 1 3|3]]}} Following Cable's funeral, the world would change drastically for the X-Men. Wolverine decided to keep X-Force operating secretly, even from Cyclops' knowledge. X-23 left the X-Men and Utopia. And, most crucially, with the return of Hope, [[Lights (Earth-616)|five new mutants]] were registered on Cerebra.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming Vol 1 2}} With the help of the X-Men, '''Hope''' raced around the world to recruit the recently emerged mutants. Under her direction, the new group trained as a rescue team for eventual new mutant manifestations.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 529|530}}{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 1}}

Dracula's son, [[Xarus (Earth-616)|Xarus]], aimed at using the mutants of Utopia as an asset to seize control of all vampires of the world. Intending to subvert Wolverine to his cause, Xarus infected Jubilee. When Wolverine went to her rescue, he was also transformed into a vampire. Wolverine's transformation was ultimately proven to be a ruse planned by Cyclops, who also had resurrected Dracula to act as an extra strategy. With [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]]'s assistance and having Dracula as a risky ally, the X-Men dethroned Xarus and freed San Francisco from the vampires.{{r|Curse of the Mutants}} Though free from his brainwashing, Jubilee kept being a vampire.{{r|X-Men Vol 3 11}} Soon after, following the reports of several missing teenagers in New York City, Cyclops sent a team to investigate. In the sewers, the group found many lizard-like creatures. Teaming up with Spider-Man, they learned Dark Beast was behind the kidnappings by manipulating the [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Lizard]]'s DNA. With Emma Frost and Spider-Man immune from the effect of his experiments, Dark Beast was defeated.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 3 7}}-[[X-Men Vol 3 10|10]]}}

[[File:X-Perience, X-Men (Lobe) (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 533 001.png|thumb|left|150px|Lobe capitalizes on the X-Men using the Xperience drug]]
After Emma Frost, Kitty Pryde and Fantomex left Utopia to dispose of Sebastian Shaw in order to prevent Namor from learning about him being alive, Utopia suffered from an [[HX-N1]] epidemy, orchestrated by Lobe. Angel gathered a team to publicly act in San Francisco and improve mutant popularity, while most of the X-Men were quarantined in Utopia. Meanwhile, Lobe dispatched his own fabricated team of X-Men, empowered by the [[Xperience]] drug.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 530}} Angel's group, assisted by [[Kate Kildare (Earth-616)|Kate Kildare]] as their public relations, performed heroic activities in San Francisco, battling the [[Han, Chang, Lin, Sun, and Ho Tao-Yu (Earth-616)|Collective Man]], who attempted to control San Francisco's crime scene.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 531}} Angel's team ultimately got into direct conflict with Lobe's X-Men during a fight against the Collective Man and easily managed to defeat and capture the impostors.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 532}} Realizing Lobe was trying to capitalize the X-Men's public image, Cyclops decided to break the quarantine.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 533}} When the X-Men infected Lobe and his partners with HX-N1, he had no option but to deactivate the artificial virus. Meanwhile, as Frost, Pryde and Fantomex battled Sebastian Shaw, Frost decided to erase his memory and set him loose instead of killing him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 534}}

On Utopia, the X-Men learned more about their past when after being attacked by the [[Evolutionaries]], who wished to test mutankind as a species.{{r|X-Men: Giant-Size Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Men Vol 3 12|15}} On Mumbai, when visiting [[Paras Gavaskar (Earth-616)|Indra]]'s family, Rogue, accompanied by Magneto and a small band of young X-Men, once again crossed paths with the Children of the Vault, who put her on trial for [[Sangre (Children of the Vault) (Earth-616)|Sangre]]'s death.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 238}}-[[X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 241|241]]}} The X-Men were successful in defeating both of these threats. Unfortunately, when they turned their attention to rebuild San Francisco after Bastion's attack, Karima Shapandar's original Omega Sentinel programming was reactivated in the presence of Hope. Involuntarily, Shapandar attacked the X-Men, but was put out of action by Hellion.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 242|243}}

===Legion, the God-Mutant===
When Pixie was kidnapped by [[Project Purgatory (Earth-616)|Project Purgatory]] operatives{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 15}} Magik led Cannonball's X-Men team to Limbo to prevent them from releasing Limbo's Elder Gods. There, the group was attacked and defeated by the [[Inferno Babies (Earth-616)|Inferno Babies]] they had rescued from S'ym years before.{{r|{{cl|New Mutants Vol 1 17}}-[[New Mutants Vol 1 18|18]]}} Magik and Karma were able to escape from Limbo,{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 19}} leading Magik to explain why she returned to the X-Men and formed her new group.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 20}}  It was revealed Magik had orchestrated Legion's return and the release of the Elder Gods, which would allow her to recover her soul and eliminate her oppressors. Magik led an army of X-Men to Limbo to combat the Elder Gods, secretly setting Legion free, in his “God-Mutant” personality, amidst the fight. Legion erased the Elder Gods from existence, and Magik recovered her soul.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 21}} As a consequence of her dangerous behavior, Magik was incarcerated by the X-Men.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 25}}

[[File:Age of X Alpha Vol 1 1 Coipel Wraparound Variant Textless.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Legion transforms Utopia into the Fortress X]]
Legion's psyche was still struggling with chaos. As a reaction to Professor X's and Doctor Nemesis' attempts to recover his mind by erasing his personalities, Legion unconsciously created [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-11326)|a new personality]] to act as an anti-body. When confronted by Xavier, this personality masqueraded as Moira and created [[Earth-11326|a reality]] where mutants from Utopia had their lives rewritten and were besieged into the [[Fortress X]], where the [[Mutant Resistance (Earth-11326)|Mutant Resistance]], under Magneto's rule, was everyday attacked by the waves of soldiers of the [[Human Coalition (Earth-11326)|Human Coalition]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 24}} In this pocket reality, Legion was a renowned super-hero, part of the [[Force Warriors (Earth-11326)|Force Warriors]], responsible for keeping the Fortress X's telekinetic barriers up. However, when Kitty Pryde was found trying to cross the barrier, Legacy (Fortress X's version of Rogue) started to question the integrity of Fortress X.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 245}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 22}} With Gambit's help, Legacy escaped the [[Moonstar Cadre (Earth-11326)|Moonstar Cadre]] and Magneto, after being accused of treason.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 246}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 23}} Legacy's and Gambit's investigation led them to free Professor Xavier from the Fortress Brig, allowing him to reveal the true origin of that world to all mutants,{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 247}} who ultimately joined forces to defeat Legion's rogue personality. Legion managed to reabsorb his evil self and returned Utopia to its former form. However, many of its residents were permanently scarred by their experience on Fortress X.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 22}}

Legion's fake reality had several consequences on the X-Men. Though Emma Frost and the Stepford sisters offered to suppress the Utopians' memories from the Fortress X on the aftermath of the crisis, some mutants, such as Frenzy, refused the help. Her recent experience led her to adopt a more heroic stance, joining the X-Men.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 248|249}} Another consequence was the escape of some of Legion's personalities to the real world. '''Legion''' joined the X-Men and the group managed to recapture the errant personalities.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 250|253}} Another consequence was a telepathic call for help sent by Rachel Grey that got distorted in the Fortress X as [[Rachel Summers (Earth-11326)|Revenant]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 250}} Rogue, using one of Legion's powers, teleported a small group of X-Men across the galaxy in order to rescue Rachel and the other Starjammers. After a conflict with the [[Grad Nan Holt]], the X-Men successfully returned home with Polaris, Rachel and Havok.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 254}}-[[X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 258|258]]}}

===Prelude to Schism===
After [[Marvin Flumm (Earth-616)|Mentallo]] manipulated [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]] to seize control of the monster population from the [[Monster Island]], the X-Men had to unexpectedly defend [[Tokyo]] from monsters during Armor's mother's and brother's funeral.{{r|{{cl|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 36}}-[[Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 37|37]]}} The X-Men followed Mentallo's trail to the Monster Island,{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 39}} where he was defeated.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 41}} Concurrently, Kitty Pryde, Colossus and Storm were recruited by her friends from S.W.O.R.D. – Beast and Lockheed, led by Abigail Brand – to rescue them from a spatial research center invaded by the Brood.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 38}} During the mission, the X-Men learned about the existence of a benevolent [[Broo (Earth-616)|Broodling]],{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 40}} who was fundamental to help the X-Men save themselves and their allies.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 42}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 534.1 Textless.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Magneto is an X-Man]]
With Kate Kildare officially invited by Cyclops to act as the X-Men's superhuman public relations, her first task, among many, was to take care about Magneto's recent return to the team.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 534.1}} Soon after, the X-Men were contacted by Abigail Brand concerning the arrival of a fleet of refugees from the Breakworld to Earth led by Krunn, who asked Colossus for asylum.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 535}} The X-Men welcomed the aliens to Utopia, where Kruun revealed his actual intentions on the first night. Using a temporary version of Kavita Rao's mutant cure, he incapacitated some of the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 536}} Kruun's beloved, [[Haleena (Earth-616)|Haleena]], in order to stop him, sacrificed and resurrected Kitty Pryde, performing the same ritual that brought Colossus back to life years before.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 537}} No longer trapped in her intangible state, Pryde managed to recruit other X-Men to defeat Kruun. Realizing the tragedy he caused to Haleena, Kruun surrendered. The refugees from the Breakworld were reallocated to San Francisco.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 538}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 543 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Colossus becomes the new Juggernaut]]
When the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|God of Fear]] sought revenge against his brother, the [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|All-Father Odin]], some superhumans were, against their wills, recruited to his cause. Among his minions was Juggernaut, now possessed by [[Kuurth (Earth-616)|Kuurth, the Breaker of Stone]].{{r|Fear Itself Vol 1 1}} More unstoppable than ever, Juggernaut marched to San Francisco, leaving a destructive path as he walked, leading the X-Men to respond to Mayor Sinclair's request for help.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 540}} As the X-Men failed in her first attempt to stop the unstoppable, Juggernaut's herald proposed an ultimatum to Cyclops and Sinclair: to destroy each other in order to save themselves. Meanwhile, Emma Frost, was telepathically infected by Juggernaut's rage on Utopia.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 541}} Cyclops deployed his X-Men in numerous different plans. All of them failed but one, involving Magik, who teleported herself, Colossus and Kitty Pryde to the [[Crimson Cosmos]] and told [[Cyttorak (Earth-616)|Cyttorak]] that his avatar venerated another god now. Enraged, Cyttorak offered Magik to be his new Juggernaut, but Colossus took the offer instead.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 542}} Imbued with the Juggernaut's powers, Colossus defeated Kuurth and saved both Utopia and San Francisco. However, Cyclops' relationship with Mayor Sinclair was damaged as both sides considered the possibility of destroying each other. On Utopia, Emma Frost was released from the Juggernaut's influence by Namor before she could harm Hope Summers, which fragilized her relationship with Cyclops.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 543}}

===[[Schism (Event)|Schism]] & [[Regenesis]]===
The future of the X-Men was tragically altered when they found an unexpected enemy in the form of [[Kade Kilgore (Earth-616)|Kade Kilgore]], the 12-year-old heir of [[Kilgore Arms (Earth-616)|Kilgore Arms]], a billionaire weapon manufacturer empire.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 16}} Kilgore regarded the business of hunting and killing mutants as a very lucrative activity. To increase anti-mutant sentiment, Kilgore recovered Quentin Quire's from his stasis and set him free upon the world. When Cyclops and Wolverine attended an international arms conference, speaking in the name of Utopia in order to prevent mutants from being persecuted, Quire committed a psychic terrorist attack, causing several nations all over the world to activate their sentinels. Successful in his plan, Kade Kilgore was crowned the new Black King of the Hellfire Club.{{r|X-Men: Schism Vol 1 1}}

[[File:X-Men Schism Vol 1 4 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cyclops and Wolverine cross a line between the X-Men]]
Following this simultaneous activation of several sentinels, Cyclops dispatched several teams to protect humans from being harmed by malfunctioning machines. Meanwhile, Mayor Sinclair expedited the grand opening of the Mutant History Museum to improve the X-Men's reputation. While Cyclops kept coordinating his missions on Utopia, Emma Frost was sent with the most powerful X-Men to the opening alongside some students.{{r|X-Men: Schism Vol 1 2}} Kilgore's Hellfire Club took this opportunity to set a bomb during the opening. Despite Wolverine's objections, Cyclops ordered one of the youngest X-Men students, [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie Okonkwo]], to stop the Hellfire Club henchmen by any means, which led to their deaths.{{r|X-Men: Schism Vol 1 3}}

As the bomb went off, a gigantic Sentinel was created and marched to a defenseless Utopia. As Utopia counting only with the power of teenagers, Cyclops decided to stay and protect the island, while Wolverine wished to evacuate it. The debate escalated into a brutal fight between them.{{r|X-Men: Schism Vol 1 4}} Ultimately, as the Sentinel arrived at Utopia, the students chose to stay and managed to destroy it. The difference, however, ended up being more than could be reconciled. Wolverine decided to leave with other X-Men and students to resettle the institute in Westchester.{{r|X-Men: Schism Vol 1 5}} Because of the schism, each resident on Utopia was forced to choose to remain with Cyclops or go back to the mutant school Wolverine.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis Vol 1 1}}

====Regenesis: Utopia====
[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 3 001.png|thumb|right|300px|Cyclops presents the X-Men as the most dangerous group on Earth while standing up to the Celestials]]
With Utopia relatively more vulnerable after the schism, the recently self-resurrected Mister Sinister turned his attentions to Cyclops' faction of X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 544}} Cyclops reformulated his division of the X-Men as the radical [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|Extinction Team]], comprising the most powerful mutants in the world. Their first challenge came in the form of Mister Sinister, who tampered with the powers of the Dreaming Celestial to generate a “sinister” fair made up of copies of himself. With the Dreaming Celestial harmed, the X-Men had to deal not only with Sinister's clones but also with the upcoming arrival of [[Celestials (Race)|Celestials]] to Earth. The Extinction Team was successful in defeating Sinister, which led the Dreaming Celestial to vouch for them due to their help. The Celestials left the planet and the X-Men's might was proved to the public.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 1}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 3|3]]}}

The Extinction Team was then alerted by Psylocke about the existence of the [[Tabula Rasa (Montana)|Tabula Rasa]], a land that had been progressed millennia in a short time span, effectively becoming alien as a consequence of the actions of the secret X-Force squad. The Tabula Rasa environment was under threat after its exposition. After allying themselves with the [[Savage (Apex) (Earth-616)|Savage]] to defeat the [[Immortal Man (Earth-616)|Immortal Man]], the X-Men guaranteed that both Tabula Rasa and the adjacent areas were secure.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 5}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 8|8]]}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 9 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Avengers and the X-Men team up to fight alien fugitives]]
After the alien prisoners kept by S.W.O.R.D. broke free on Earth, Abigail Brand enlisted the Extinction Team to recapture the most dangerous criminals in the universe. During their mission, the X-Men teamed up with the Avengers. Among the adversaries was the robot known as [[Unit (Earth-616)|Unit]], who directly approached Hope. Cyclops decided to abandon his main mission in order to save Hope. Though successful in saving Hope, the X-Men were criticized by Captain America for their desertion, a disagreement that would escalate in the near future. After the conflict, Unit was locked on Utopia by Brand's, something that allowed him to manipulate the Extinction Team from within, especially Danger and Hope.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 9}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 10|10]]}}

Meanwhile, Cyclops tasked Psylocke to be in charge of a reconnaissance squad, a security group actually led by Storm. The team dismantled a Sentinel operation in [[Puternicstan]] with the help of [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]],{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 3 20}}-[[X-Men Vol 3 22|22]]}} rescued Jubilee and the [[Forgiven (Earth-616)|Forgiven]] from bounty hunters,{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 3 24}}-[[X-Men Vol 3 27|27]]}} and confronted a faction of Skrulls alongside Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 3 28}}-[[X-Men Vol 3 29|29]]}} Storm started to guide her team outside Cyclops' authority, especially after learning about the existence of the [[Proto-Mutants]], an ancient race of super-humans who had been clones and manipulated by [[David Michael Gray (Earth-616)|David Gray]]. With Sabra's help, Storm's team located the [[Gabriel Shepherd (Earth-616)|last proto-human alive]], but Storm's independent actions caused Colossus to disapprove her methods, leading to a fight between the two long-time friends.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 3 30}}-[[X-Men Vol 3 37|37]]}}

====Regenesis: Westchester====
[[File:Jean Grey School for Higher Learning from Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 3 page --.png|thumb|right|300px|The Jean Grey School staff and students resist the Hellfire Club]]
In Westchester, Wolverine founded the [[Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]], that was built and managed with the help of Kitty Pryde, Beast, Iceman, Rachel Grey, Husk and even Toad (as a janitor). The school also had massive technological support from the Shi'ar Majestor Kallark, under the condition that [[Kubark (Earth-616)|Prince Kubark]] enrolled at the school. Kubark was accompanied by a Shi'ar [[Ava'Dara Naganandini (Earth-616)|Warbird]]. On their school's first day, when being evaluated by the New York State Department of Education, they were attacked by the Kilgore's Hellfire Club, since the school represented an unexpected factor in Kilgore's plans. The school was attacked in a variety of ways: a [[Krakoa III (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] (which the school had been built upon) tried to demolish the estate; an army of Frankenstein monsters invaded the school; and the state inspectors were transformed into a [[Abigail Marigold (Earth-616)|Wendigo]] and a [[Eugene Clud (Earth-616)|Sauron]]. They were saved by none other than Quentin Quire, who, being kept in the school against his will, telepathically accessed the Krakoa's mind. Having been tortured his whole life by the Hellfire Club, Krakoa had their first friendly interaction with Quire's telepathic contact. Revealing to be a mutant, '''Krakoa''' let his guard down, apologizing and hoping to become an X-Man, effectively becoming the school's grounds. With their plans ruined, the Hellfire Club fled. Kade Kilgore was later served papers by [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]], having been sued by Wolverine for the damage he caused.{{r|{{cl|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 1}}-[[Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 3|3]]}}

However, the school still faced financial problems. In order to solve them, Wolverine and Quire traveled to [[Sin (Planet)|Planet Sin]], using Quire's telepathy to gamble. At the school, Kitty Pryde experienced an apparent pregnancy. Soon, Beast discovered she had been infected by microscopic Brood, a ploy orchestrated by xenobiologist [[Xanto Starblood (Earth-616)|Dr. Xanto Starblood]] to approach the benevolent Broo, who had enrolled in the Jean Grey School. The X-Men destroyed the Brood, while Broo himself knocked Starblood out. On Planet Sin, Wolverine and Quire failed in their attempt of cheating, which costed Wolverine's legs, that were deformed by a matter transmuter.{{r|{{cl|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 4}}-[[Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 7|7]]}} Wolverine's legs were cured after some of his students, guided by Angel's and [[Evan Sabahnur (Earth-616)|Genesis]]' intentions, traveled to Planet Sin and retrieved the matter transmuter to Earth in order to help their teacher. Meanwhile, on the S.W.O.R.D. space station, Beast fought Sabretooth, the newest employee of the Hellfire Club.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 8}}

Other X-Men, who acted as teachers at the Jean Grey School, faced parallel problems. Rogue joined other teachers and some students to confront Exodus, who believed the X-Men schism to be a mistake and attempted to rejoin the X-Men factions using his force.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 261}}-[[X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 263|263]]}} Later, Rogue also helped the former members of Osborn's X-Men, Mimic and Omega, when Omega's powers went out of control.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 264|265}}

[[File:Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 51 Wraparound Textless.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The wedding of Northstar]]
Meanwhile, some of the X-Men also had problems apart from the Jean Grey School. When a new group of Marauders, controlled by the mysterious [[Da'o Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Susan Hatchi]], made their move against the X-Men, a new unexpected group was assembled, formed by Northstar, Wolverine, Iceman, Gambit, Cecilia Reyes, Karma, and '''Warbird'''. Hatchi was revealed to be Karma's missing half-sister and, in seek of revenge and power, planned to take control of Madripoor by manipulating her sister and her friends. The X-Men eventually defeated her. Around this period, the X-Men were present during Northstar's wedding with [[Kyle Jinadu (Earth-616)|Kyle Jinadu]].{{r|{{cl|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 48}}-[[Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 56|56]]}} This group of X-Men stuck together in different adventures, such as helping Warbird investigate the past of an alien race known as the Fianden{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 57|58}} and preventing Iceman from being corrupted by a [[Death Seed]] and freezing the whole world.{{r|{{cl|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 62}}-[[Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 65|65]]}}

When a new [[Samuel Alexander (Earth-616)|Nova]] crashed in New York, he alerted the Avengers with a cryptic warning: "it's coming". His uniform carried the energy signature of the Phoenix. Simultaneously, the X-Men noticed flaring up with the power of the Phoenix during a training session, which the Avengers detected. Supported by Wolverine and knowing about Hope Summers, Captain America arrived on Utopia with the intent of taking Hope into protective custody. Cyclops, convinced that the coming of the Phoenix could herald the rebirth of mutantkind as a species, refused Captain America, who feared the possibility of Earth's destruction. As Cyclops struck the first blast at Captain America, the Avengers assembled and began an invasion of Utopia.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 1}}{{r|AVX: Vs Vol 1 1}} Amidst the combat between Avengers and the X-Men, Hope fled from Utopia.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 2}} Cyclops feigned a surrender to the Avengers, teleporting out of Utopia with several powerful X-Men and gaining a head start in the search for Hope. During the quest for Hope, Wolverine and Captain America had a violent conflict, which forced Wolverine to search her by himself.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 6 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|The hosts of the Phoenix Force]]
Many members of the Jean Grey School joined the X-Men in their war against the Avengers. Since Hope had scattered her signal to several places at once, several teams of X-Men traveled around the world to find her, facing Avengers on Wakanda, Tabula Rasa, Latveria, the Wundagore Mountain, and the Savage Land. On the South Pole, Wolverine was ultimately contacted by Hope herself, who asked him a chance to control the Phoenix. Meanwhile, the Phoenix situation caught the attention of the Shi'ar Majestor, who, fearing for the safety of his heir, sent the Shi'ar Death Commandos to target Hope, who in turn managed to overpower the mercenaries thanks to her new power levels. Hope and Wolverine invaded an A.I.M. facility and flew to the Blue Area of the Moon, in order to prevent the Phoenix from reaching Earth. There, it was revealed Wolverine had announced their location to the Avengers, who waited for them on their destination. Almost immediately, the group was intercepted by the X-Men.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 4}}{{r|{{cl|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 9}}-[[Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 11|11]]}}{{r|AVX: Vs Vol 1 2}} As the Avengers' attempt at destroying the Phoenix on space failed,{{r|{{cl|Secret Avengers Vol 1 26}}-[[Secret Avengers Vol 1 28|28]]}} a badly injured Thor crashed onto the Moon, followed by the Phoenix. The Avengers and X-Men descended into a brawl as the power of the Phoenix increased within Hope and she found herself unable to control it. Desperate, she asked Wolverine to kill her, although Cyclops prevented him from doing so. Iron Man used a [[Iron Man Armor Model 38|special suit]] to try to destroy the Phoenix, but he only managed to splinter it, causing it to took the [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|five X-Men present as hosts: Cyclops, Emma Frost, Namor, Colossus, and Magik]].{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 5}}

The "Phoenix Five" returned to Utopia, reuniting mutantkind and providing resources to improve the world by stopping wars, destroying weapons and providing free food, water, and energy around the globe. Unsatisfied with the potential of the Phoenix for evil, the Avengers continued to be an opposing force, attempting to kidnap Hope from Utopia. The Avengers were successful in their mission due to the Scarlet Witch's intervention.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 6}} Around this period, the X-Men successfully defeated the Shi'ar army and Majestor Kallark{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 13}} and obliterated the Hellfire Club's Sentinel factories, forcing their members to be arrested.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 16}} At the same time, the X-Men decided to put the Phoenix's power to destroy Mister Sinister for good. Arriving at [[Sinister London]], the X-Men made their move. Sinister had predicted their actions and planned to siphon the Phoenix Force into some Madelyne Pryor's clones he had manufactured to remodel the world under his image. Though the villain was apparently successful at first, the Phoenix Force proved to be too unpredictable for his calculations and obliterated his plans and his life.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 14}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 17|17]]}}

[[File:Namor McKenzie (Earth-616) from Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 7 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Namor floods Wakanda]]
The X-Men then turned their attention into incapacitating the Avengers, shutting down their operations and capturing their members. When the Avengers kidnapped the mutant [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Transonic]] during a conflict between the X-Men and the Scarlet Witch, Namor was convinced by Emma Frost to attack the Avengers in their current base, Wakanda.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 7}} Namor and his Atlantean army flooded Wakanda, as some Avengers escaped to [[K'un-Lun]] with Hope. The Avengers narrowly managed to defeat Namor, at the cost of great damage to themselves and Wakanda. With Namor defeated, his portion of the Phoenix Force was bequeathed to the other four hosts.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 8}} Having even more power to control, the Phoenixes acted erratically and showed signs of losing control. Moreover, with the fall of Wakanda, Storm's marriage to Black Panther was annulled. These events led the X-Men to question the integrity of the Phoenix and many of their members abandoned Utopia. As the Avengers staged a prison breakout for their fellows, Colossus and Magik lost their portions of the Phoenix after being manipulated by Spider-Man.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 9}}

In K'un-Lun, Cyclops tried to recapture Hope, but was fended off by [[Shou-Lao (Earth-616)|Shou-Lao]] and Hope herself, who managed to nullify his powers and teleport him away to the Moon. On Utopia, Emma Frost ruled the X-Men with an iron fist, threatening those whose thoughts displeased her, prompting more mutants to leave Utopia. Several X-Men then teamed up with the Avengers after realizing that Cyclops and Emma had completely lost control. Together they attacked Cyclops and Emma and gained the upper hand until Cyclops was forced to take the final piece of the Phoenix from Emma, making him the sole host. The complete Phoenix proved too much and finally turned him into Dark Phoenix upon which he killed Professor X after Xavier attempted to stop him.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 10}}

[[File:Charles Xavier (Earth-616) and Scott Summers (Earth-616) from Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 11 0001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The death of Charles Xavier]]
Under Charles Xavier's lead, the X-Men joined forces with the Avengers in an attempt to defeat Cyclops and Emma Frost on Utopia. During the attack, Cyclops confronted their former allies and ultimately Emma Frost, absorbing her portion of the Phoenix. Confronted by Xavier, a Phoenix-possessed Cyclops ultimately murdered his former mentor.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 11}} The X-Men and the Avengers combated the destruction the Phoenix produced around Earth. Cyclops, after a brief moment of composure, got rid of the Phoenix with the help of Hope and the Scarlet Witch. Using the Phoenix's powers, Hope restored the devastation caused by Cyclops. Alongside the Scarlet Witch, she decided to dissipate the Phoenix Force, which caused new mutants to manifest all over the world since the M-Day.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 12}}

Cyclops was brought into custody accepting full responsibility for the tragedy. As he learned that mutantkind has been reborn, he declared that, while he regretted the destruction he caused and the death of Professor Xavier, he would do it all again to save mutantkind. On the other side of the story, Captain America acknowledged the Avengers should have done more to help mutants instead of standing by while the world hated them. This led Captain America to form the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Squad]], a team of Avengers led by Cyclops' brother, Havok, in hopes of keeping Charles Xavier's dream of coexistence between mutants and humans alive.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 20}}{{r|{{cl|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 1}}-[[Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 4|4]]}}

Meanwhile, X-Men at the Jean Grey School foresaw problems in Cyclops' movement. At the same time, Beast began suffering from a further mutation, which could mean his end. Also distressed by Cyclops' extreme stance against anti-mutantism, which Beast believed would antagonize humanity and threaten the future of mutantkind, Beast traveled back to the time of the original X-Men.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 1}} He brought the young versions of the X-Men the present after informing them Cyclops had killed Professor Xavier.

===Mutant Revolution===
At the reading of Charles Xavier's will, the X-Men learned that Cyclops had inherited the Jean Grey School. At the same time, Cyclops also discovered about a nefarious legacy of Xavier's past, the insane and omnipotent mutant named [[Matthew Malloy (Earth-14923)|Matthew Mallow]], who had been erased from existence by Eva Bell, now going by Tempus. Tempus accused Cyclops' revolutionary discourse of bringing the chaos behind Malloy's destructive actions.

Following this reunion of mutantkind, Cyclops was able to establish a new mutant sovereign state known as "Nation X", granting protection for the X-Men in the former Weapon X Facility.

When Muir Island was swept by a toxic terrigen cloud, a moribund Jamie Madrox called the X-Men for help. As soon as Cyclops entered in contact with the mists he fell ill and died of M-Pox. Fueled by rage and unwilling to let Scott's legacy end, Emma Frost revealed to the world the hazard of Terrigen to mutants, destroying one of the two clouds that roamed the world with the help of [[Thomas Jones (Earth-616)|Alchemy]], at the cost of his own life. With the cloud destroyed, the Inhumans confronted the X-Men, while Frost kept projecting a mental image of Cyclops to keep his death a secret. When Black Bolt killed "Cyclops", Emma's wish to see him die for his cause and transcend his mortality to become an idea was fulfilled.{{r|{{cl|Death of X Vol 1 1}}-[[Death of X Vol 1 4|4]]}}

Frost's actions in the name of Cyclops were not well received by the world, leading mutants to become prosecuted and hated once again, and prompting the X-Men to disband. The manipulations also raised tensions between inhumans and mutants. With her people in constant danger, Storm started working on a sanctuary called [[X-Haven]],{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 1}} which consisted of the entirety of the Jean Grey School being moved to the realm of Limbo with the help of [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] and other magicians.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 7}} Magneto also made his move by assembling a group of [[X-Men (Magneto's) (Earth-616)|'''X-Men''']] who, unlike Storm's, took a harsher stance to ensure the survival of the mutant species.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 1}} Meanwhile, the time-displaced original X-Men decided to assist the crisis by themselves on a road trip.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 1}}

[[File:X-Haven from Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The hellish X-Haven]]
Realizing that mutants had a place in the world, Storm rebuilt the X-Men with Iceman, Magik, Colossus and Forge (with his pet Sentinel, [[Cerebra (A.I.) (Earth-616)|'''Cerebra''']]) at her side. When recruiting time-displaced Jean Grey, the group discovered that [[James Howlett (Earth-21923)|an aged version of Logan]] was active in Canada.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 1}} Concurrently, as Magik and Colossus attempted to rescue Nightcrawler in the Morlock Tunnels, they were kidnapped by Mister Sinister. With Magik out of commission, X-Haven lost her protection and was vulnerable to the demonic forces of Limbo.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 2}} The attack convinced Jean Grey and the '''Old Man Logan''' to join Storm's X-Men.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 3}} The X-Men decided to take the fight to Sinister, in hopes of saving Magik and restoring Limbo. There, they learned Mister Sinister took interest in experimenting with the inhuman DNA, creating an [[Scott Summers (Clone) (Earth-616)|inhuman clone of Cyclops]].{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 4}} The insane clone ravaged the streets of New York City, but was destroyed by the X-Men, who publicly announced their return and declared they would fight for mutantkind.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 5}}

[[File:Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Storm gets the X-Men back together against the Inhuman threat]]
After rescuing a group of mutant refugees guarded by Sunfire in the [[Weirdworld (Battleworld)|Weirdworld]],{{r|{{cl|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 6}}-[[Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 7|7]]}} the X-Men went to Japan to secure the manifestation of six hundred new mutants. They learned the signal corresponded to embryos engineered by the Sugar Man. During the fight, Colossus and his students were sent to the future and the other X-Men followed them to the [[Omega World]].{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 8}} The group was attacked by the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-16558)|Horsemen of Apocalypse]], who had Colossus added to their ranks as War.{{r|{{cl|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 9}}-[[Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 10|10]]}} After the X-Men confronted [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-16558)|Apocalypse]] himself, the Omega World collapsed. Magik managed to teleport the team back to X-Haven with Colossus and Apocalypse as their prisoners.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 11|12}} Other prisoners the X-Men made during this period were the [[Nasty Boys (Earth-616)|Nasty Boys]], whom they had rescued from a prison contaminated with terrigen.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Annual Vol 1 1}}

The X-Men's next crisis concerned Magik's pupil, the girl named [[Sapna (Earth-616)|Sapna]], who had been possessed by the entity known as the [[World-Eater (Earth-616)|World-Eater]] and managed to steal Magik's Soulsword.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 13|14}} As Sapna attempted to destroy X-Haven, Magik found support with the [[Magical Resistance (Earth-616)|Magical Resistance]], a group made with survivors of the World-Eater's destruction.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 15}} Ultimately, Magik had no choice but to put Sapna down, protecting X-Haven from the World-Eater. During the conflict, Apocalypse was slain by Nightcrawler, ensuring Colossus' freedom.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 16}}

When Beast, who had been working with the Inhumans to find a cure to M-Pox, discovered that the remaining cloud was weeks from reaching a saturation point, which would've caused it to become fully assimilated into the atmosphere, rendering the Earth completely uninhabitable for mutants, he shared this information first with the X-Men. Believing that the Inhumans would refuse to destroy the cloud even at this moment, the different factions of the X-Men were united by Emma Frost and launched a coordinated attack on Inhuman key players in order to neutralize them long enough, trapping most of them in Limbo, to use a machine created by Forge to absorb and destroy the Terrigen.{{r|IVX Vol 1 1}}

[[File:IVX Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Inhumans vs. X-Men]]
Two of the newest Inhumans, [[Xiaoyi Chen (Earth-616)|Iso]] and [[Dante Pertuz (Earth-616)|Inferno]], managed to escape the assault on [[New Attilan]]{{r|IVX Vol 1 2}} and destroyed Forge's machine, taking him hostage. The two young Inhumans then called reinforcements in the form of other NuHumans, including [[Morris Sackett (Earth-616)|Mosaic]],{{r|IVX Vol 1 3}} who used his powers to infiltrate Muir Island and learn the X-Men's reason behind their attack, later reporting that to his peers,{{r|IVX Vol 1 4}}  which prompted the NuHumans to join forces with Forge to come up with a new solution.{{r|IVX Vol 1 5}}

The NuHumans then traveled to [[Iceland]], the latest location of the Terrigen Cloud, but were soon confronted by the X-Men, who had no idea of their plans.{{r|IVX Vol 1 5}} The royal Inhumans joined the brawl, having escaped from Limbo and regrouped. The battle was interrupted when [[Ennilux (Earth-616)|Ennilux]] arrived, having provided Forge and [[Lunella Lafayette (Earth-616)|Moon Girl]] with the resources to build the machine necessary to eliminate the Terrigen Cloud. Medusa was notified of what was at stake and given the trigger to activate the device. In spite of what the destruction of the Terrigen Cloud meant for Inhumans, Medusa activated the machine, destroying the Cloud and ending the threat of the M-Pox. However, Cyclops' time-displaced younger self exposed Emma Frost's lies regarding the events surrounding his older self's death. Driven mad by Cyclops' death at the hands of the Inhuman Mists, Emma insisted on fighting the Inhumans, employing reprogrammed Sentinels to massacre the Inhumans from Ennilux. The X-Men joined forces with the Inhumans and eventually managed to take Frost and her Sentinels down, although she managed to escape.{{r|IVX Vol 1 6}}

===[[ResurrXion]]===
In the wake of the war, Storm considered her performance during the conflict catastrophic and chose to pass the reins of leadership to Kitty Pryde, who had recently returned to Earth after working with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. Kitty decided to take advantage of the doors to the future opened for mutantkind to build on Xavier's dream once again, creating a legacy of mutant heroes and protectors of the world. As part of this plan, Kitty had the X-Mansion moved from Limbo to the middle of [[Central Park]] as the Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach, in order to boost the exposure of the X-Men as a super-heroic group.{{r|X-Men Prime Vol 2 1}} Meanwhile, the time-displaced original X-Men made a dark alliance with Magneto, being based in [[X-Mansion (Madripoor)|Madripoor]].{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Men: Blue Vol 1 2|2]]}}

[[File:X-Men Gold Vol 2 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|The golden age of mutant super-heroes]]
Back to the basics, the main team of X-Men protected New York City from threats such as [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax the Tamer]]. However, they still faced adversities for their status in the form of anti-mutant activist [[Lydia Nance (Earth-616)|Lydia Nance]] and a new Brotherhood led by Mesmero, who attacked the United Nations Headquarters{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 1}} and kidnapped the Mayor of New York City.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 2}} Upon defeating Mesmero and saving the day, the X-Men discovered the terrorist attacks' agenda was planned by Nance, who hoped to damage the public opinion on mutants, forging an explicitly hostile relationship between the X-Men and Nance's organization.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 3}} Soon after, when Gambit accidentally created a new form of nanite-based Sentinels while being manipulated by [[Olivia Trask (Earth-616)|Olivia Trask]],{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 4}} the X-Men intervened and destroyed the Sentinels with the help of several other super-heroes.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 5}}-[[X-Men: Gold Vol 2 6|6]]}}

When Captain America was turned into a [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Hydra Agent]] by [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]] and took over the entire country, he trapped New York City within a [[Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]] dome cast by [[Marcus Daniels (Earth-616)|Blackout]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} With the X-Mansion vulnerable with the Darkforce attack, an [[X-Cutioner (Alex's Father) (Earth-616)|anti-mutant assassin]] took the opportunity to assault the X-Men and their students in retaliation for Xorn's attacks that had killed his family years before. The killer was ultimately contained by the X-Men before causing major harm.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 7}}-[[X-Men: Gold Vol 2 8|8]]}}

Meanwhile, out of the dome, Captain America had planned to control and neutralize mutant interference to his plans by secretly offering a portion of the western United States as the mutant sovereign state of [[New Tian]]. Xorn was appointed as the leader of New Tian and the remaining X-Men joined him.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 17}}{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} With the tension rising between New Tian and Hydra Nation, causing confrontations between X-Men and [[Avengers (Hydra) (Earth-616)|Hydra's Avengers]], it was revealed that real liege behind Xorn was Emma Frost, who controlled him psychically.{{r|Secret Empire: United Vol 1 1}} Ultimately, interrupting the amicable diplomatic relations with Hydra, Frost joined forces with Magneto as the X-Men from Manhattan and New Tian entered the final battle against Captain America and his fascist regime after the Darkforce dome was deactivated.{{r|{{cl|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}}-[[Secret Empire Vol 1 10|10]]}}

With the Hydra over, a [[Mutant Deportation Bill|congressional bill was proposed to deport mutants from the U.S.]] Kitty Pryde and Colossus tried to testify against it with the help of Congresswoman Stevie Hunter, when unexpectedly confronting the terrorist [[Anton Vanko (Whiplash) (Earth-616)|Whiplash]].{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 8}}-[[X-Men: Gold Vol 2 9|9]]}} Soon after, the X-Men also had to deal with the return of Omega Red by the [[Molina (Earth-616)|Russian Mafia]] since they had captured Magik to force her to restore him to his full strength.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 10}}-[[X-Men: Gold Vol 2 11|11]]}} After this, the two factions of X-Men were briefly reunited when Mojo captured them to serve as attractions to his television shows, replicating several of the X-Men's classic battles.{{r|Mojo Worldwide}}

[[File:Phoenix Resurrection The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 5 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Jean Grey is resurrected by the Phoenix]]
With bizarre psychic events started to manifest all over the globe, accompanied by sightings of previously deceased mutants, the different factions of past and present X-Men decided to investigate as they linked the events to the coming of the Phoenix.{{r|{{cl|Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 1}}-[[Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 2|2]]}} After finding Jean Grey's coffin empty, the X-Men traveled to [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]], by Emma Frost's advice, and found the illusory psychic reality that the Phoenix had created for Jean Grey, responsible for the unusual psychic phenomena.{{r|Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 3}} As the X-Men battled several of their former teammates who had been reanimated by the Phoenix,{{r|Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 4}} they reached Jean Grey, who decided to reject the Phoenix Force for good and returned to her former life.{{r|Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 5}} Jean Grey, determined to change a world she did not recognize anymore, formed her own team of [[X-Men (Jean Grey's) (Earth-616)|X-Men]], who fought for a peaceful future.{{r|X-Men: Red Vol 1 1}}

As the issues with the mutant deportation bill turned more complex, the X-Men Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler were kidnapped to the [[Negative Zone]] by the army of [[Kologoth Antares (Earth-616)|Kologoth]], who rescued their leader who had been defeated and incarcerated by the X-Men for his actions as a member of Mesmero's Brotherhood.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 16}} The remaining X-Men assembled a special squadron with Armor and [[Eric Gitter (Earth-616)|'''Ink''']] to retrieve their teammates.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 17}} As Kologoth awakened the destructive god named [[Scythian Algurus (Earth-616)|Scythian]],{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 18}} the X-Men had no choice but to kill Kologoth and trap Scythian inside the void of the Negative Zone.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 19}} With Storm's powers, the X-Men managed to return home.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 20}}

[[File:X-Men Gold Vol 2 25 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Iceman's replacement X-Men]]
Meanwhile, Mesmero reassembled his Brotherhood and performed an attack against his former employer Lydia Nance after breaking out of prison. As the X-Men intervened, Mesmero managed to manipulate them into attack a [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]] team, which was part of Nance's plan since the beginning.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 21}}-[[X-Men: Gold Vol 2 22|22]]}} With the X-Men incarcerated at the mutant prison known as the [[Robert Kelly Correctional Facility|Box]], Iceman and Rogue formed a replacement squad made up of Magma, Magik, Armor, Ink and the new [[Simon Lasker (Earth-616)|'''Pyro''']],{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 23}} who faced threats such as the [[Ivan Guerrero (Earth-616)|Shredded Man]]{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 24}} and the return of Scythian in [[Paris]], which guaranteed the X-Men's freedom as they had defeated him in the past. With Scythian destroyed by the heroic actions of X-Men, the Mutant Deportation Bill was dropped.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 25}}

Nance tried to eliminate the X-Men by other means by aligning herself with the nanite-based Sentinel known as [[Alpha (Sentinel) (Earth-616)|Alpha]].{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 25}} They developed a mutant-killing virus based on remnants of the Legacy Virus in Colossus' body, whom had been kidnapped to this end, leading the X-Men to tracked him down to Nance's Savage Land base.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 26}}-[[X-Men: Gold Vol 2 27|27]]}} Nance was knocked out cold by Kitty Pryde while Alpha escaped to space in order to release the virus. With the help of [[Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]], the X-Men stopped him. With Nance's plan thwarted, she was sent to the [[Triskelion]] by the X-Men, while Alpha was presumably put out of commission by Iceman.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 28}}-[[X-Men: Gold Vol 2 29|29]]}} With Colossus rescued and safe, the X-Men prepared to attend his wedding to Kitty Pryde. Although she had a change of heart at the last moment and interrupted the wedding, the X-Men still celebrated the union of Rogue and Gambit.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 30}} Following the wedding, the X-Men were a target for Mesmero one more time, who cast an illusion to control Rachel Grey.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 31}}-[[X-Men: Gold Vol 2 32|32]]}} After defeating him, they helped Storm defeat [[Uovu (Earth-616)|Uovu]], a god who tormented her former village.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 35}}

===[[X-Men Disassembled|Disassembled]]===
When [[Roderick Campbell (Earth-811)|Ahab]] started to hunt the time-displaced original X-Men, all factions of the X-Men reunited at the X-Mansion to protect themselves. Simultaneously, the teenage Iceman was kidnapped by a younger version [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], who also executed his older self.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 1}} Soon after, Cable retrieved the time-displaced Angel, an event that was followed by Ahab invading the X-Mansion with his Hounds.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 2}} As Ahab infected some X-Men by mind-controlling them, Cable claimed young Beast, but was intercepted by time-displaced Jean Grey and the X-Force.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Extermination Vol 1 5 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The original X-Men return home]]
Cable revealed his intention of sending the original X-Men back to the past in order to prevent dystopic consequences to the timestream. With Jean Grey and the X-Force as his allies, he traveled to [[X-Lantis]] to recover Cyclops before Ahab could harm him.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 4}} As Cable sent the original X-Men back to the past, Jean Grey locked their memories to be reawakened in their future selves' minds. As she completed the process, the original adult X-Men recollected their past versions' memories, managing to defeat Ahab. With the threat over, it was revealed that the kid Cable was also responsible for resurrecting Cyclops using a caged portion of the Phoenix Force. For the first time in years, the original adult X-Men were all alive at the same time, though Cyclops' return was still kept secret to his friends.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 5}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 5 1}}

With the return of the original X-Men to the past, Kitty Pryde was joined by Jean Grey and her X-Men to keep Xavier's ideals alive. However, they had no tranquility as a series of weird phenomena caught their attention, leading Pryde to go missing. At the same time, [[Ashton Allen (Earth-616)|Senator Ashton Allen]] divulged the proposition of a new anti-mutant vaccine. Similarly to Pryde, Allen and the X-Man Angel also vanished with no explanations during a raid carried out by the Multiple Man.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 1}} Amidst catastrophes and hysteria, Legion approached the X-Mansion, offering help to the X-Men's students in ceasing the conflicts.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 2}} As the X-Men learned Legion was behind the attack performed by the Multiple Man, they confronted him at the X-Mansion, only to be interrupted by the arrival of the so-called [[Horsemen of Salvation (Earth-616)|Horsemen of Salvation]] who obliterated the Xavier Institute alleging the X-Men had to end.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 3}} The master of the Horsemen was revealed to be Nate Grey, who, after having an immense power boost by a [[Life Seed]], was behind the kidnappings of Pryde, Allen, Angel and also Apocalypse.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 4}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 10 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|The fall of the X-Men]]
As the X-Men uselessly tried to defeat the Horsemen,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 5}} Legion found support with the X-Men's students and attempted to imprison the unwell Nate Grey in his home reality, the "Age of Apocalypse", but also trapped the students in there.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 6}} Unable to finish Nate Grey,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 7}} the students were rescued by Bishop, which caused Nate Grey to take control over Legion's body and powers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 8}} On the usual reality, the X-Men found an unexpected ally in Apocalypse when battling X-Man and his Horsemen. Meanwhile, Jean Grey assembled a distress call to several current and former X-Men and allies, gathering an army to stop Nate Grey.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9}} However, the X-Men failed and Nate Grey used the Life Seed to erase their existence. The X-Men were declared dead.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 10}}

Nate Grey had actually transported the X-Men to [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|a pocket reality he had created]], a perfect world where the dream of mutants living with no strife, oppression or dependence was achieved. In this reality, the [[X-Men (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] had their existences rewritten and served as the world's most adored heroes.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}} However, this world lacked interpersonal intimate relationships, as a way for Nate Grey to prevent communion and rebellion. Apocalypse served as a revolutionary leader for the [[X-Tracts (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Resistance]], which caused the X-Men to start questioning their place in this world.{{r|{{cl|Age of X-Man: The Marvelous X-Men Vol 1 1}}-[[Age of X-Man: The Marvelous X-Men Vol 1 4|4]]}}

Meanwhile, on the real Earth, Cyclops, presuming the X-Men were dead, reconnected with a recently resurrected Wolverine in order to protect victims of the rising anti-mutant sentiment.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 11}} Based in [[Harry's Hideaway]], Scott and Logan decided to track and recruit the remaining X-Men as a new threat emerged in the form of O*N*E's new director, [[Robert Callahan (Earth-616)|General Callahan]]. The X-Men were reformed after Havok and the technarchy-infected New Mutants were rescued from one of O*N*E installations, victims of procedures that weaponized them as sentinels.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 12}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 14 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Cyclops and Wolverine reassemble the X-Men]]
The new group of X-Men targeted potential threats to mutantkind or from dangerous mutants, starting with the Dark Beast. During the fight, they recruited Multiple Man, who had been a subject of Dark Beast's experiments. The captured Dark Beast was forced to work for the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 13}} Meanwhile, the X-Men found an ally in Val Cooper, who informed them about the Mutant Liberation Front activities. At the same time, Dark Beast provided the X-Men with information about the Marauders, who had been slaughtering the Morlocks. As the X-Men helped the Morlocks to evacuate to [[Chernaya]], after liberating a region of the country from extremist militants at Cooper's request. Their action granted them with Chamber as their new member.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 14}} In their next intervention, the X-Men tracked the Mutant Liberation Front, now led by Hope Summers and with Banshee added to their ranks. The X-Men defeated and captured Banshee and Hope, but not before she managed to assassinate an anti-mutant politician and costed Cyclops his right eye. At Harry's, Dark Beast cleaned the New Mutants from the technarchy, restoring Warlock in the body of one of Multiple Man's duplicates.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 15}}

When the King of the [[Dark Elves]] [[Malekith (Earth-616)|Malekith]] led an invasion to Earth,{{r|War of the Realms}} Dani Moonstar, as a Valkyrie, was summoned to the battle. The X-Men followed her and Magik included Hope and Banshee on the team.{{r|War of the Realms: Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 1}} The X-Men established a fortress in the Queens to resist Malekith's forces, where they were attacked by Sabretooth, who had joined Malekith's wild hunt.{{r|War of the Realms: Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 2}} Sabretooth was defeated and executed by Wolfsbane and Magik after Sunspot perished in battle. Days later, after the war, the X-Men returned home and mourned their losses.{{r|War of the Realms: Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 3}}

Cyclops decided to hand the Mutant Liberation Front members to the government but kept Dark Beast, as he considered him to be a useful asset, something that caused distress with Havok concerning the X-Men's leadership. This led the group to be rebranded as a leaderless initiative, with decisions being taken collectively. The X-Men then hunted the Brotherhood down in Transia, defeating them with the help of Juggernaut, who asked to rejoin the team after learning the Brotherhood's leader was not Magneto, but his clone, Joseph. Unexpectedly, Joseph was swiftly slain by Kwannon, who went back to the U.S. with the X-Men as they learned Wolfsbane had been murdered.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 16}} With Kwannon's help, Wolverine avenged Wolfsbane by killing her aggressors. Meanwhile, Juggernaut questioned the X-Men about the whereabouts of Emma Frost, only to learn the group could recognize one of its most prominent former members.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 17}}

The X-Men turned their attention to the Marauders, who were destroyed by Chamber at the cost of his own life. As the X-Men returned home, they learned Harry's Hideaway was burned to the ground by Mister Sinister. The X-Men imprisoned Sinister as he unexpectedly surrendered and relocated to one of Karma's buildings.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 18}} Mister Sinister was handed to Captain America, who was revealed to be secretly Mystique in disguise and working for Emma Frost's new Hellfire Club, who in turn was being blackmailed by Callahan.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 19}} However, Wolverine and Kwannon managed to uncover the façade and directly confronted Frost and O*N*E, being defeated. Meanwhile, the rest of the X-Men confronted and fended the Upstarts off after finding the lifeless bodies of the Nasty Boys. Later, under Cyclops' orders, Dark Beast developed an antidote to the anti-mutant vaccine announced weeks earlier. However, when meeting with Doctor Nemesis and the real Captain America, Cyclops not only discovered the existence of an impostor but also learned Dark Beast's cure caused extremely dangerous collateral reactions. The X-Men escaped with Nemesis and put Dark Beast down, being summoned by Emma Frost to help her defeat O*N*E moments later.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 20}}

[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 22 001.jpg|thumb|left|The X-Men return from the Age of X-Man]]
As the X-Men arrived at the Hellfire Club Mansion, Emma Frost revealed that the reasons behind her recent actions involved Callahan blackmailing her. As Callahan stroke back by attacking the X-Men's home, Magik and Juggernaut were lost. The X-Men escaped back to the Hellfire Club Mansion, where they learned that Emma Frost, with the assistance of Doctor Nemesis, Fabian Cortez and Mister Sinister, had erased the concept of mutantkind from all the minds on the planet, in a desperate attempt to end anti-mutant sentiment.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 21}}

Frost's forced pacifism proved to be a bizarrely unnatural new situation to the X-Men. However, the X-Men were still targets of Callahan's Technarchy-based Sentinels, as he was proven to be immune to the telepathic erasure performed by Frost. As the X-Men Havok, Warlock and Multiple Man perished when trying to combat Callahan's Sentinels, the X-Men believed they faced a hopeless fight.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 22}} Meanwhile, on Nate Grey's dimension, the X-Men were able to see through his imposed illusion of peace, ripping apart the society he had created.{{r|Age of X-Man: The Marvelous X-Men Vol 1 5}} The mutants on his Utopia, by uniting themselves, overcame his manipulations and convinced him to set them free. The X-Men abandoned Nate Grey's dream and returned to their cruel reality{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}} just in time to assist the X-Men in destroying Callahan and his Sentinels. Together, the X-Men decided to deactivate Frost's device and restore the world's memories about mutants. The X-Men were back to fight the war for Xavier's dream once again.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 22}}

[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) from X of Swords Destruction Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|right|Cyclops and Marvel Girl lead the X-Men to defend Krakoa]]
When Professor X, with the assistance of Magneto and Moira, established a mutant nation on Krakoa,{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}} the X-Men disbanded, as they were believed to no longer be needed. However, they ultimately reformed when Cyclops and Jean Grey gathered an army of mutants to rescue the [[Swordbearers of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Swordbearers of Krakoa]] during the [[X of Swords|Krakoa-Arakko War]] in Otherworld.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 15}} After this event, Cyclops and Jean Grey decided to permanently recreate the team going as opposed to accepting positions on the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council]], since they felt that Krakoa needed heroes working in their best interests, representing and fighting for mutantkind.

At the [[Hellfire Gala]], Cyclops and Jean Grey announced the members of the Krakoan X-Men. Adopting a telepathic voting system, the new X-Men line-up elected by mutantkind, and led by the pair, was revealed to the world: [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]], Wolverine ([[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|Laura]]), [[Everett Thomas (Earth-616)|'''Synch''']] and [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]].{{r|X-Men Vol 5 21}} Emma Frost then purchased and ceded an estate in Central Park [[86th Street]] Transverse to serve as the X-Men's new headquarters. They turned it into a park to celebrate and remember mutant accomplishments and losses. Moreover, Krakoa, Forge and Cypher created a techno-organic [[Treehouse]] for the team to operate in. Unlike other Krakoan habitats, the Treehouse area was open to humans.{{r|X-Men Vol 6 1}}

After forming, this team fought off two alien attacks: one by the [[Mind Reaver (Earth-616)|Mind Reaver]] in Manhattan{{r|X-Men Vol 6 1}} and the other by the Annihilation Wave in Kansas. The attacks were the work of the intergalactic crime-lord [[Cordyceps Jones (Earth-616)|Cordyceps Jones]], who had been running bets on who could destroy the Earth first on his casino, [[Gameworld]].{{r|X-Men Vol 6 1|2}}

| Equipment               = [[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebro]]; formerly [[Danger Room]], [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]], [[Image Inducer]] Cyber-glasses. Although most X-Men choose to individualize their costumes, standard blue and gold uniforms are available.
| Transportation          = [[Gateways]]; formerly [[X-Men Blackbird]]. The original is still in use and [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]] has constructed additional models for each team. An earlier version was the [[X-Men Stratojet]] and before that the [[X-Copter]].
| Weapons                 = No standard weaponry. Some members have at times carried weapons as suited their tastes.

| Notes                   = * The name "X-Men" was trademarked by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]], and inherited by [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] upon Charles' death.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 13}}
* It should be noted that bigotry toward Mutants in the world of the X-Men has long been seen as a metaphor for all kinds of prejudice towards others occurring in the real world. Professor Xavier has been equated to peaceful civil rights activists like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Conversely, Magneto could be compared to more violent activists like Malcolm X. Recently, Storm has been forming her own perspective that acts as a middle ground and is analogous to opinions of moderate progressive activists.
* According to the [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]], the founding X-Men took an oath to help anyone who was in trouble.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 5}} He invoked the oath to convince his teammates to help out a mysterious mutant who was under attack by an angry mob. The Angel was unaware that the attack victim was the [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]] in disguise.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 5}}
| Trivia                  = * X-Men co-creator [[Stan Lee|Stan Lee]] originally intended for the team to be called "The Mutants." Publisher [[Martin Goodman]] shot down the idea, allegedly arguing readers wouldn't know what a mutant was.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/stan-lee-x-men-mutants/|title=What Stan Lee Originally Wanted to Call the X-Men|work=CBR.com|first=Kevin|last=Melrose|date=13 September 2017|accessdate=14 September 2017}}}}
