===Origins===
A young man named [[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|Nathaniel Richards]] wearing armor came from the future, fleeing [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]], his future self. He arrived at [[Avengers Mansion]], but it was abandoned in light of the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]'s mental breakdown and subsequent damage caused{{r| House of M}}. He headed to [[Stark Industries]], and he was able to access the A.I. of [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] and uploaded it into the armor.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 3}}

The A.I. explained that it contained the '''[[Avengers Fail-Safe Program]]''', listing young heroes ''related'' to the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 3}}{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #1}}

[[File:Young Avengers Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|The original Young Avengers]]
He formed a team with [[Elijah Bradley (Earth-616)|Eli Bradley]], [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Billy Kaplan]], and [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Teddy Altman]]. They took every mission available, such as rescuing people during a fire. After their first mission was recounted in the [[Daily Bugle]], [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]] was sent to investigate the heroes who had been nicknamed ''Iron Kid'', ''Lieutenant America'', ''Teen-Hulk'', and ''Thor Jr.''. [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] also investigated.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 1}}

[[Cassandra Lang (Earth-616)|Cassie Lang]] was interested in following her [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|father]]'s legacy, and her powers accidentally triggered during an argument with the others.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 2}} [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Kate Bishop]] accompanied the heroes after helping them fight off kidnappers at her sister's wedding.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 1|2}}

The Young Avengers prepared for Kang's arrival.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 1}} Captain America, Iron Man, and Jessica Jones tried to dissuade them and had them locked in the Mansion while they awaited Kang.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 3}} Kang was able to convince Cap and the others to assist him in this effort, showing them visions of an apocalyptic future he claimed would occur if Iron Lad was not forced to become another version of Kang. Kate had memorized the access codes, though, and was able to let them out as well as find items for them to prepare to battle Kang.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 4}}

[[Image:Young Avengers Vol 1 10 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|The Young Avengers]]

Iron Lad was separated from his armor due to Kang's cybernetic control, but with the Vision's A.I. it continued to fight him on its own. Kang left, but not before Iron Lad stabbed him with the [[Swordman's Sword]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 5}}

The [[Vision (Jonas) (Earth-616)|Vision]] was able to reform himself from Iron Lad's armor. Changes in the timestream forced Iron Lad to return to his future and become Kang, so he bade the others farewell and thanked them for at least trying to help.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 6}}

Captain America was impressed with their effort but said that without parental permission he and Iron Man could not train them. Their equipment was also confiscated. {{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 6}}

Kate was able to locate a [[Bishop Publishing|new base]] and provided new costumes and equipment. With Captain America and Iron Man both taking interest in the kids' futures, the relationship between the Young Avengers and the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] was up in the air. Also, the Vision, which formed from Iron Lad's armor was a blank slate, with no past experiences or history, and was, in essence, a child. The Young Avengers used their abilities to protect those that could not protect themselves and fought against evil at every turn.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 6}}

===Secret Identities===
[[File:William Kaplan (Earth-616), Elijah Bradley (Earth-616) and Mutant Growth Hormone from Young Avengers Vol 1 9 001.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Wiccan discovers Patriot using MGH]]
The Young Avengers had to decide how much to tell their parents after the members decided to continue acting publicly. None of their parents found out. During a fight with [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mister Hyde]]{{r|Young Avengers #8}}, Wiccan discovered Eli abusing [[Mutant Growth Hormone|MGH]], a drug that gave people powers for short periods to appear to have superpowers. Eli confessed that he deceived the Vision, who meant to recruit his missing [[Josiah al hajj Saddiq (Earth-616)|uncle Josiah]], to join the team. Overwhelmed with emotion, he quit the team.{{r|Young Avengers #7|8}}

Jessica Jones interviewed the Young Avengers about their pasts at the insistence of [[Katherine Farrell (Earth-616)|Kat Farrell]]. Cassie Lang had a troubled home life, especially after her father died. She and her [[Peggy Rae Burdick (Earth-616)|mother]] constantly fought and she hated her mom's new [[Blake Burdick (Earth-616)|boyfriend]]. Had the Young Avengers not formed, Cassie planned to join the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]]. Teddy Altman abused his [[Shapeshifting|shapeshifting]] powers to hang out with a more [[Greg Norris (Earth-616)|popular kid]]. He realized that he had gone too far when his "friend" tried to force him to steal artifacts from the destroyed Avengers Mansion. Billy Kaplan had a problem with being accepted. He met the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], who explained that being different was not bad. Because Kate Bishop was assaulted in a [[Central Park|park]], she began combat training. Eli Bradley took the Mutant Growth Hormone because he felt powerless against some thugs, and wanted to prove that his [[Isaiah Bradley (Earth-616)|grandfather]] truly was the ''first'' Captain America.{{r|Young Avengers Special #1}}{{r|Truth: Red, White & Black #1|7}}

===Family Matters===
[[File:Kl'rt (Earth-616) and Theodore Altman (Earth-616) from Young Avengers Vol 1 9 001.jpg|left|thumb|175px|[[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|The Super-Skrull]] capturing [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]]]]
[[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Kl'rt the Super-Skrull]] tried to take Teddy to [[Tarnax IV|Tarnax IV, the Skrull homeworld]]. Kl'rt revealed that [[Mary-Jo Altman (Earth-616)|Mrs. Altman]] was not Teddy's mother and killed her. In the aftermath, Kl'rt kidnapped Teddy.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 9}} The Vision offered to locate more "Young Avengers" using his prior incarnation's contingency plan. The Young Avengers broke [[Thomas Shepherd (Earth-616)|Thomas Shepherd]] out of a superhuman prison and recruited him. Tommy could move at superhuman speed and accelerate matter, destabilizing it enough to cause an explosion.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 10}} The Super-Skrull told Teddy of his true origin as the son of the [[Kree]] hero [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], and the Skrull princess [[Anelle (Earth-616)|Anelle]]. He claimed that Tommy and Billy were lost twin sons of the Scarlet Witch and [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]]. Billy believed him, but Tommy did not. Kree and Skrull combat forces arrived and fought each other and the Young Avengers until Teddy, realizing his importance to both sides, called for a ceasefire. The Avengers intervened and a Kree warrior fired at Captain America. Patriot intervened and was gravely wounded.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 11}} Hulkling and Kl'rt ended the fighting by secretly shapeshifting into each others' forms. Captain America and Kl'rt, disguised as Hulkling, brokered shared custody between the races.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 12}}

[[File:Elijah Bradley (Earth-616), Faith Shabazz (Earth-616), and Isaiah Bradley (Earth-616) from Young Avengers Vol 1 12 001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Isaiah providing a blood transfusion for Eli]]
At a hospital, Eli's grandfather donated his blood to Eli. Captain America again told the Young Avengers to stop what they're doing. Kate blamed their trouble on the Avengers for not training them. The Young Avengers repaired the statues of fallen Avengers at Avengers Mansion. Eli now had superpowers as a result of the blood transfusion. Kate received [[Hawkeye's Bow]] and quiver from Captain America and she took the mantle of Hawkeye. Tommy arrived in costume and called himself Speed.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 12}}

===[[Civil War]]===
[[File:Civil War Vol 1 2 page 14 Young Avengers (Earth-616).jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Young Avengers being arrested by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] for not complying with the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]]]
In [[Civil War|Superhero Civil War]], members of Young Avengers were captured by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] for not complying with the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. Captain America and the [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] helped them escape. Once in Captain America's secret base, the Young Avengers joined the resistance movement called the [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]].{{r|Civil War #2}} The team followed Captain America into a trap set by Iron Man. Wiccan, along with [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]], was knocked out via tranquilizers while the rest of the Young Avengers joined the fight against Iron Man and the pro-registration heroes. Stature left the resistance after [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Goliath]] was killed by a [[Thor (Clone) (Earth-616)|clone of Thor]] and the Secret Avengers were forced to retreat from battle, leaving Wiccan behind. However, shortly afterward, Stature registered and began superhero training. The remainder of the team remained with Captain America. Stature was with Iron Man and the rest of the "pro-reg" group during the final battle between registered and rebel heroes.

[[File: Civil War Young Avengers and Runaways Vol 1 1 through 4 Textless.jpg|center|thumb|640px|The Young Avengers teaming up with the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]]]]

===[[Secret Invasion]]===
During the [[Secret Invasion]], the Young Avengers were the only team in [[New York City]] to respond to the Skrull troops' first attack. Hulkling and Wiccan were the first to fall before the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] arrived to help. Despite the added support, the rest of the Young Avengers were defeated and Vision got his head blown off. Because of his royalty, Hulkling was the main target of the Skrulls. Before his execution, [[Xavin (Earth-616)|Xavin]] of the Runaways (also a Skrull) saved his life.{{r|Secret Invasion: Runaways/Young Avengers #1|3}}

===[[Dark Reign]] and [[Siege]]===
After the Secret Invasion transpired, all the Young Avengers remained under low profile during [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark Reign]], who introduced his own version of the [[Young Masters (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] and send them to battle only to fall against the original Young Avengers.{{r|Dark Reign: Young Avengers #1|5}} Meanwhile, Stature and Vision both joined the [[Mighty Avengers (Pym) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]].{{r|Mighty Avengers #28|31}}

[[File:Young Avengers (Earth-616) from Siege Young Avengers Vol 1 1 001.jpg|left|thumb|150px|The Young Avengers during the [[Siege]] of [[Asgard]]]]
During the [[Siege (Event)|Siege]] of [[Asgard]], the Young Avengers joined the battlefield alongside all the heroes available. Stature and Vision assisted the Mighty Avengers, Patriot and Hawkeye assisted the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], Speed acted at rescue/evac, and Wiccan and Hulkling fended off the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]].{{r|Siege: Young Avengers #1}}

===The Children's Crusade===
After Wiccan's powers overloaded and the Avengers decided to keep him under observation, Hulkling and the other Young Avengers broke Wiccan out of holding and began the search for the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]. Accompanied by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], the team traveled to [[Transia]] and then to [[Latveria]] before discovering a depowered and amnesiac Wanda engaged to [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]. The rediscovery of Wanda did not go unnoticed though, as the Avengers soon arrived on the scene. A battle with Doom's [[Doombot|Doombot army]] soon broken out and was only stopped by the arrival of Iron Lad.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #1|4}}

[[File:Young Avengers (Earth-616) from Avengers The Children's Crusade Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|Iron Lad]] escaping with the Young Avengers and [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Wanda Maximoff]] in the timestream]]
Iron Lad took the Young Avengers and Wanda into the timestream in an attempt to regroup and restore Wanda's memories. The group arrived at the Avengers Mansion, shortly before the Scarlet Witch originally killed some of her fellow Avengers. Cassie used this opportunity to save her father's life. This trip was successful in restoring all of Wanda's powers and memories. Returning to the present Avengers Mansion, Wanda and the Young Avengers were met by [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], Jessica Jones, and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]].

[[File:Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616), Young Avengers (Earth-616), and Scott Lang (Earth-616) from Avengers The Children's Crusade Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] regaining her memories]]
With Wanda's memories restored, she desired to make amends for [[M-Day]], but was unsure how. To determine if she could repower any [[Homo Superior|mutants]], a volunteer needed: [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] from [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations]]. Wanda was successful in restoring his powers, but the celebration was cut short by the arrival of both the Avengers and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #5|6}}

With tensions high, a brawl broke out between the Avengers, Young Avengers, X-Factor, and X-Men over the custody and fate of the Scarlet Witch, forcing Wanda to put everyone asleep in an attempt to quell the fighting. Next, with the Young Avengers, Wanda returned to Doom in Latveria to regain her reality-warping powers. However, during the ritual to restore her powers, Patriot intervened and Doom betrayed them stealing the power for himself.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #7}}

Armed with the reality-warping powers, Doom returned to New York City to offer the Avengers and X-Men a choice: join him or perish. During the ensuing battle, Doom's powers were overloaded and depleted. Unfortunately, Stature gave her life to defeat Doom.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #8}}

[[File:Young Avengers (Earth-616), Avengers (Earth-616), Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616), New Avengers (Earth-616), and Scott Lang (Earth-616) from Avengers The Children's Crusade Vol 1 9 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Young Avengers, Avengers, [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] and [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] mourning the deaths of [[Cassandra Lang (Earth-616)|Stature]] and [[Vision (Jonas) (Earth-616)|Vision]]]]
Iron Lad proposed saving Stature by traveling into the timestream, but Vision refused, resulting in his destruction at the hands of Iron Lad. Although Wiccan warned of the danger of becoming Kang the Conqueror, Iron Lad left with the intent of alerting the timestream to suit his will and promising he would be much better than Kang.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #9}}

[[File:Young Avengers (Earth-616) from Avengers The Children's Crusade Vol 1 9 0001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] officially inducted as full-fledged [[Avengers]]]]
In the aftermath of the battle, the Young Avengers disbanded and remained low profile during the major events that transpired over the next several months (the [[Spider-Island (Event)|Spider-Island]] infestation, the X-Men's [[Schism (Event)|Schism]] and the resurrection of the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]]). Wiccan stayed in a severe state of depression until Hulkling cheered him up by proposing. However, their moment of joy was interrupted by [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] who called them to the Avengers Mansion. After a few words from Captain America, all the remaining Young Avengers (Hawkeye, Hulkling, Speed and Wiccan) were officially inducted as full-fledged Avengers, and a memorial to Stature and Vision was unveiled.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #9}}

===Marvel NOW!===
Sometime after their induction into the Avengers, the Young Avengers again decided to disband due largely to Wiccan's urging. Teddy and Tommy moved in with the Kaplans, but Tommy moved out a short time later.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #1}} Kate began working with Clint Barton,{{r|Hawkeye Vol 4 #2}} while Teddy used his shapeshifting power to take on the identity of other superheroes to continue his heroics in secret.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #1}}

When Billy learned about the secret superhero acts of Teddy, they had a fight that ended with Billy searching the Multiverse for a reality where Teddy's mom wasn't dead and transport her to their reality. Wiccan was unaware he had been being manipulated by [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]], the responsible for the following events, in an attempt to control Billy, knowing he was destined to become the omnipotent [[Demiurge]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #1}} Instead of taking Teddy's mom, Wiccan accidentally took an interdimensional parasite called [[Mother (Interdimensional Parasite) (Earth-TRN287)|Mother]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #1}}

[[File:Young Avengers Vol 2 2 Hans Variant Textless.jpg|right|thumb|The new team]]
Billy and Teddy were saved from Mother's grasp by Loki,{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 2}} and they were soon joined by other young heroes, [[America Chavez (Earth-616)|Miss America]],{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 3}} [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Noh-Varr]], and Kate.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 4}} At this point, Mother had taken control of numerous adults and had used her powers to revive the deceased parents of these young heroes. When they were cornered in [[Central Park]] by their resurrected parents and an army of mind-controlled adults only they could see, Loki convinced Wiccan to lend him his power for ten minutes to save them all with his better skill at magic than Wiccan. As soon as Loki acquired Billy's powers, he disappeared, abandoning the group.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #4}}

While he intended to leave them to die, Loki had an internal conversation with his [[Loki Laufeyson (Kid Loki) (Earth-616)|late child self]], and was convinced to return to the team and empower them. After defeating Mother's army and escaping, the parasite faded away. Loki explained they couldn't go back to any place their parents were or had died (in the case of any deceased parent brought back by Mother) or Mother would return, as her powers were distance-based. The young heroes decided to stay together and travel through the universe.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 5}}

In the next three months, Billy was trained by Loki to be prepared to fight Mother, with the ulterior motive of gaining his trust. The Young Avengers were joined by [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|Prodigy]], who informed them Speed was kidnapped by a strange [[Patriot (Entity) (Earth-616)|entity]] dressed as Patriot.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 7}} The Young Avengers chased the entity through the Multiverse, who brought them to [[Earth-TRN287|Mother's Dimension]]. They escaped, but accidentally left Prodigy and Hulking behind.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 8}} Using numerous evil alternate version of themselves as a distraction, the Young Avengers distracted Mother and save Hulking and Prodigy. Back to Earth-616, Hulking left the team to figure out if he really loved Wiccan or if his feelings were merely a consequence of Billy unwittingly using his reality-warping powers to influence their romance, an unshakable discomfort Loki planted in Teddy's mind.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 9}}

Teddy sought for help with [[Leah (Construct) (Earth-616)|Leah]], who tricked him into returning to New York City, allowing Mother to come back to Earth-616, and threaten to unleash the evil versions of the Young Avengers to the world.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 10}} Since Billy was still too weak to end the spell which brought Mother, Loki suggested that he would be able to do it if his body were older, thus making Wiccan age him into a young adult. Unfortunately, Loki claimed that his powers didn't remain. The trickster revealed he had a second plan, to turn Wiccan temporarily into the Demiurge, his form with all of his potential unleashed. After Prodigy called all the teenager heroes available to fight Mother, the team headed out to confront her.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 11}}

During the battle, it was revealed Leah and her [[Young Avengers (Constructs) (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] was a physical manifestation of Loki's guilt and the missing powers which he subconsciously gave up due to his guilt over killing his younger self.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 12}} Loki finally confessed his crimes, the murder of his younger self and the manipulations the Young Avengers had been victims of. His confession made Leah and her Young Avengers disappear, thus Loki regained his powers and freed Teddy. Hulkling comforted Billy, and reconciliation with him. Their reunion allowed Billy to become the Demiurge and destroy Mother. The team returned to Central Park where they were met by Billy's parents, but before he could introduce them, they realized Loki was gone, having fled the scene wracked with guilt over his actions.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 13}}

Celebrating Mother's defeat, the Young Avengers threw a New Years' party, along with many young heroes that had come to their rescue.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 14}} During the part, Prodigy was confronted by the [[Patriot (Entity) (Earth-616)|entity]] who had kidnapped Speed, and after he discovered the entity's true nature, the entity returned Speed, who joined the Young Avengers in the party until it ended.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 15}}

When the team departed the place using one of Miss America's portals, Loki, from behind, took a photo of the moment.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 15}}

===Original Sins===
Hulkling and Prodigy went to Noh-Var's space station to tell him that his [[Exterminatrix|ex-girlfriend]] was destroying space. The three of them investigated the blast site where the [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Watcher's]] eye detonated after his murder.{{r|Original Sins Vol 1 1}} Prodigy decided to help [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|The Hood]] extract the information that affected people in the vicinity of the Watcher's eye exploding, before it killed them.{{r|Original Sins Vol 1 3}}

===Reunion===
Eventually, Eli and his mother returned to New York, and his friends welcomed them back with a celebratory dinner. His former teammates were encouraged Eli to become Patriot again. As they were talking, the villain [[Terminus (Destroyer) (Earth-616)|Terminus]], attacked in a fit of rage. Jumping in, the Young Avengers reassembled again.{{r|Marvel Comics Vol 1 1000}}

===Empyre===
All of the Young Avengers are present during Billy and Teddy's "official" wedding.{{r|Empyre: Aftermath Avengers Vol 1}} When they originally eloped [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|David Alleyne]] was missing from the group.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 4}} This is despite him having been with both Teddy and Tommy earlier that same night.{{r|Lords of Empyre: Emperor Hulkling Vol 1 1}}

*In the last issue of the [[Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America Vol 1|''Fallen Son'']] series, when the funeral of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] took place at [[Washington, D.C.]], all of the Young Avengers were present, wearing their outfits, and were even mentioned by name by the [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]], while delivering the ceremonial speech. This suggested another amnesty was offered to [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and [[Elijah Bradley (Earth-616)|Patriot]] (and maybe [[Thomas Shepherd (Earth-616)|Speed]] as well, although he was never accounted for during the story), who had stayed in the resistance after the end of the [[Civil War]], alongside the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]]. 
*In {{cl|She-Hulk Vol 2 #21}} it was revealed that the [[Dorrek VIII (Earth-721)|Hulkling]] and [[William Kaplan (Earth-721)|Wiccan]] that appeared to have joined the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] were actually a pair of [[Multiverse|interdimensional]] travelers known as "[[Earth-721|Alphas]]" whereas the actual [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]] and [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] were shocked at the discovery that they had registered (the canonicity of this story, which was largely humorous, is unclear). Their current registration status, along with that of Hawkeye, Patriot, and Speed remains murky.
* It seems that the [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young]] [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Man]] [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]] is somewhat infatuated with the Young Avengers. He seems to know a lot about them{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #34}} and even threaten to join them.{{r|Young X-Men #7}} This maybe because as a gay teen superhero, Anole feelings a sense of comradery with [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]] and [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]].
| Trivia                  = 
* The first Young Avengers powers, costumes, and codenames were inspired by classic [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] [[List of Avengers members|members]]:
** [[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|Iron Lad]] is based by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] (and in effect [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]]). However, [[Vision (Jonas) (Earth-616)|Vision]], who replaced Iron Lad, is inspired partially by Iron Man and primarily by the original [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]].
** [[Elijah Bradley (Earth-616)|Patriot]] is the grandson of the [[Isaiah Bradley (Earth-616)|''black'' Captain America]], and bears a resemblance to [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|the classic Captain America]], [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky]] and [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]].
** [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]] is the son of [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], a [[Kree]], and the [[Skrull]] princess [[Anelle (Earth-616)|Anelle]]. He bears a resemblance to the green and muscular [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], but lacks his "anger issues".
** [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] is patterned after both [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|The Scarlet Witch]].
** [[Cassandra Lang (Earth-616)|Stature]] is the daughter of [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]], wears his old costume, and has his [[Pym Particles|powers]]. Her powers are also similar to those of [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Giant-Man]], [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]], [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Goliath]], [[Rita DeMara (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]], [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Atlas]] and the new [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]].
** [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] is based on a combination of original [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]] and uses weapons similar on [[Hawkeye's Bow]], [[Mockingbird's Battle Staves]] and [[Swordman's Sword]]. Her ability to learn quickly and master weapons have been compared to the villain [[Taskmaster (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]].
** Juvenile delinquent [[Thomas Shepherd (Earth-616)|Speed]] is based on the reformed supervillain [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]].
** Some classic [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] [[List of Avengers members|members]] that have yet to receive a Young Avenger counterpart include: [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]], [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]], [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]], [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].

* The new Young Avengers members were as well more or less inspired from [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] [[List of Avengers members|members]]:
** [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Noh-Varr]] is a member of the [[Kree]] race and, so it could have an inspiration in [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], having been first an enemy then an ally of [[Earth]], being inspired by him and having even wielded that code-name.
** [[America Chavez (Earth-616)|Miss America]] is the "patriotic character," regarding her code-name and costume, that matching with [[Steve Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and having the capacity of flying and having super-human strength she shares powers with some female Avengers members like [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]] or [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]].
** [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]] has less correlation, but still is an Asgardian, so he could be a [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] counterpart, being a sorcerer he shares powers with [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]].
