===Origins===
The Elders of the Universe's origins are lost in the early history of the universe. They are some of the oldest living beings in the universe. Each of the Elders is the last survivor of their respective species, most of which evolved right after the "[[Big Bang]]", the cataclysmic event in which the universe was created.{{citation}} Their respective species were the earliest creations of the [[Celestials (Race)|Celestials]].{{r|History of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1}}

[[Maht Pacle (Earth-616)|Obliterator]] stated that he is 5.5 billion years old, and that other Elders are about the same age.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 6}} They are virtually immortal{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia Vol 1 1}} and not only have they outlived their respective races, they have also all outlived their original galaxies. While they are not [[Abstract Entities]], they have all attained some level of cosmic power. As the relatively few survivors of the earliest period of the universe, the Elders regard themselves figuratively as brothers. They do not often associate with each other aside from the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]]'s schemes.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 3}} Some meetings occur on member [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego the Living Planet]];{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 4}} Ego cannot attend when Elders meet elsewhere.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 7}}<!--

===Contest of Champions===
The Elders were granted immortality by Death after Grandmaster staged the "Contest of Champions" in an attempt to revive [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]]. -->

===Killing Galactus===
The Collector then joined the other Elders in the Grandmaster's scheme to kill [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]]. Thus, the existing universe would collapse.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 4|10}} The Elders would survive the big crunch and the subsequent big bang of a new universe, becoming Galactus-like beings in the new universe.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 17|19}} The scheme failed, but the Collector had become one of the threats to the universe he had once predicted and against whom he had schemed.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 58|61}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 64}}

===Thanos Quest===
Following the Grandmaster's schemes, the Elders took possession of the [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Gems]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 19}} The [[Soul Stone|Soul Gem]] went to the [[In-Betweener (Earth-616)|In-Betweener]], the  [[Power Stone|Power Gem]] went to [[Tryco Slatterus (Earth-616)|Champion]], the [[Time Stone|Time Gem]] went to the [[Ord Zyonz (Earth-616)|Gardener]], the [[Reality Stone|Reality Gem]] was taken by the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]], the [[Space Stone|Space Gem]] went to the [[Gilpetperdon (Earth-616)|Runner]] and the [[Mind Stone|Mind Gem]] went to the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]]. They held them for a time until The mad Titan [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] gathered these gems into the [[Infinity Gauntlet (Item)|Infinity Gauntlet]].{{r|Thanos Quest Vol 1 2}}

===The Cosmic Cube===
Accessing the power of a stolen [[Cosmic Cube#Other cubes|Cosmic Cube]], Thanos summoned a gathering of the astral versions of some cosmic heavyweights, including the [[Stranger]], the [[In-Betweener]] and three of the [[Elders of the Universe]]. While Thanos briefly taunted them with the powerful item, the Collector coveted it, seeking to broker a trade. Tiring of the general exchange, Thanos turned the Cube on the other entities, seemingly wiping them from existence.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 7}} They had actually been teleported to the [[Earth-10011|Cancerverse]], as the artificial Cosmic Cube wasn't powerful enough to kill them. The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] joined them soon after the Mad Titan tried to kill them as well. The Elders made a deal with the heroes, using a weapon from the Collector's vault, the Avengers weakened Thanos after returning to Earth. The united forces of Earth's heroes proceeded to defeat Thanos, and as part of the deal, the Elders got to decide what to do with him.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 8}}

===Deadpool Corps===
The [[Deadpool Corps]] was founded by [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] after he was chosen by the [[Tath Ki (Earth-616)|Contemplator]] in stopping a cosmic entity known as the [[Awareness (Earth-616)|Awareness]] that devours the [[multiverse]]'s consciousness. In truth, the Deadpool Corps's real power to stop the entity is their unique mind that ultimately made them absolutely immune to the entity.{{r|Prelude to Deadpool Corps Vol 1 5}} The Deadpool Corps came into conflict with the [[Tryco Slatterus (Earth-616)|Champion]], who and along with the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] did not see them as worthy heroes and decided to test them.{{r|Deadpool Corps Vol 1 1}} Fortunately, the Corps proved their worth by tricking the Champion into becoming two-times stranded on a planet.{{r|Deadpool Corps Vol 1 5}} With help from the [[Broken Blade (Earth-616)|Broken Blade]], the Corps annihilated the entity who turns out to be a little alien that was the lone survivor of his species after the Big Bang.{{r|Deadpool Corps Vol 1 12}}

===The New Contest of Champions===
Following the temporary death of the [[Multiverse]],{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 1|9}} the Elders of the Universe discovered the reality where the Multiversal renewal began, [[Earth-15513|a broken dimension]] where the remains of a planet named [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]] floated as the broken shell of what once was everything that remained of the Multiverse, formerly controlled by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]. Due to being the epicenter of a new creation, this dimension became rich in a powerful substance known as [[Neutronium|Iso-8]]. The Elders of the Universe resolved to fight for its concentrated and most powerful form, the [[ISO-Sphere]], and decided to use the remains of Battleworld as an arena for the new Contest of Champions. Each Elder abducted a contestant from across the Multiverse to fight to death on their behalf. When the Contest of Champions drew to a close, only the Collector's and the Grandmaster's competitors remained, the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-69413)|Maestro]] of [[Earth-69414]] and the [[Jacob Gallows (Earth-928)|Punisher]] of [[Earth-928]], respectively, and the other Elders had returned back to Earth-616 with their hands empty. Maestro and Punisher conspired against their masters, and among their plans, they suggested a new Contest of Champions, where they would become summoners for their superiors, and choose their own champions to fight on their and their master's behalf. In the end, Maestro managed to acquire the entirety of the ISO-Sphere and banish the last two remaining Elders back to their reality.{{r|Contest of Champions Vol 1 6}}

==Powers and Abilities==
===Powers===
'''Power Primordial:''' The Power Primordial is residual energy left over from the Big Bang that created the current universe. The circumstances in which the various Elders each gained some of this energy are yet to be revealed. While the energy itself is vast, it takes years of intensive training to purposely channel the energy to grant each of the Elders the various superhuman physical, mental, or energy manipulative capabilities that they possess. Each Elder has purposely channeled the Power Primordial to grant them greater abilities in some areas than in others. This renders the Power Primordial similar to the cosmic energy housed in the bodies of the [[Eternals (Homo immortalis)|Eternals]].{{citation}}
