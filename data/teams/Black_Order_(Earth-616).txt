| HistoryText             = The first servant of [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] to be made a member of the dreadful Black Order was his favorite one, [[Corvus Glaive (Earth-616)|Corvus Glaive]].{{r|As stated by [[Corvus Glaive (Earth-616)|Corvus Glaive]] himself in {{cl|Black Order Vol 1 1}}}} He was later joined by the [[Butcher Squadron (Earth-616)|Butcher Squadron]] survivors [[Ebony Maw (Earth-616)|Ebony Maw]] and [[Proxima Midnight (Earth-616)|Proxima Midnight]],{{r|Thanos Vol 3 6}} as well as his brother [[Black Dwarf (Earth-616)|Black Dwarf]] and [[Supergiant (Earth-616)|Supergiant]].{{r|Infinity Vol 1 1}} At some point, the Black Order served [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] against [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego the Living Planet]], whose very existence was an offense to [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]], and thus to Thanos as well. Their battle ultimately ended in a stalemate.{{r|Thanos: A God Up There Listening Infinite Comic Vol 1 1|6}}

===Invading Earth===
Years later, after learning the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] left the [[Earth]] unguarded to battle the [[Builders (Race)|Builders]] in space, Thanos assembled his Black Order once more to invade the planet.{{r|Infinity Vol 1 1}} By analyzing the memories of an [[Outriders (Race)|Outrider]] previously sent to Earth to uncover its secrets, Thanos learned that most of the [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Gems]] were lost by the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]], so he sent the Black Order after the remaining one: the [[Time Stone|Time Gem]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 9}}

The Black Order landed in different points of the world in order to confront the Illuminati{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 8}} and discover the Time Gem's location. In [[New York City]], [[Ebony Maw (Earth-616)|Ebony Maw]] was able to take control of [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], making him help to find what Thanos was seeking. In [[Wakanda]], [[Black Dwarf (Earth-616)|Black Dwarf]] and his army were defeated by the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]]. In [[Atlantis]], [[Proxima Midnight (Earth-616)|Proxima Midnight]] convinced [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] to tell her where the Time Gem was. At the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]], Corvus Glaive and Supergiant faced the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] but left upon realizing there was no Infinity Gem there.

Namor told Proxima Midnight that the Time Gem was in Wakanda,{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 9}} prompting the Black Order to quickly seize the country at a later point. In the [[Necropolis]], they found the Illuminati's antimatter bombs.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 11}} Meanwhile, Ebony Maw located the other thing Thanos was looking for on Earth: his son, [[Thane (Earth-616)|Thane]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 10}} The Black Order (minus [[Supergiant (Earth-616)|Supergiant]]) departed to [[Greenland]], Ebony Maw's location, for Thanos to kill his son. Following his defeat at the hands of the Black Panther, Black Dwarf was left to guard [[Peak VII|The Peak]] as it was discovered the Avengers were returning to Earth.{{r|Infinity Vol 1 5}}

[[File:Black Order (Earth-616), Thanos (Earth-616), and Thane (Earth-616) from Infinity Vol 1 6 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]
Black Dwarf was killed when the Avengers regained control over The Peak; Supergiant was killed when the antimatter bombs she activated were transported along with her by [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]], an [[Inhomo canis lupus familiaris|Inhuman dog]] ally of the Illuminati, to a distant uninhabited planet; Corvus Glaive was killed by [[Marcus Milton (Earth-13034)|Hyperion]] when the Avengers arrived in Greenland in order to confront Thanos; and finally, Ebony Maw double-crossed Thanos and freed Thane to let him fight his father, prompting Thane to trap Thanos, Proxima Midnight, and [[Corvus Glaive's Glaive|Corvus' Glaive]] in an amber construct which left them in a state of "living death."{{r|Infinity Vol 1 6}} The remaining members of the Black Order (a resurrected Corvus Glaive and Proxima Midnight) and Thanos later joined the [[Cabal (Namor's) (Earth-616)|Cabal]] to aid Namor in countering the [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 24}}

===Quest for Mjolnir===
After doing away with [[Black Order (Corvus Glaive's) (Earth-616)|Corvus Glaive's incarnation of the Black Order]],{{r|Thanos Vol 2 1}} Thanos assembled his second Black Order with Proxima Midnight and fellow Cabal member [[Yabbat Ummon Turru (Earth-1365)|Black Swan]].{{r|{{cl|Unworthy Thor Vol 1 3}}-[[Unworthy Thor Vol 1 4|4]]}} While imprisoned below the [[Triskelion]], Thanos was approached by [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]]. She wanted his support and in exchange would give him a [[Mjolnir]] from [[Earth-1610|an alternate reality]] as tribute.{{r|Unworthy Thor Vol 1 2}} Thanos accepted the deal, and sent Proxima and Black Swan to aid Hela in retrieving the hammer from the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]]'s [[Collector's Ship|ship]].{{r|Unworthy Thor Vol 1 3}} After the Black Order was forced to return empty-handed, Hela killed Proxima Midnight to prove her power to Thanos.{{r|Unworthy Thor Vol 1 5}}

===The Challenger's Contest===
[[File:Black Order (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 676 001.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]
In preparation for contest against the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]], the [[Challenger (Elder of the Universe) (Earth-616)|Challenger]] reformed the Black Order, bringing back its deceased members in the process.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 681}} They were set to face the Grandmaster's own team, the [[Lethal Legion (Grandmaster) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]], as part of a competition that took place on Earth.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 677}} As soon as the competing teams were teleported to the battleground to survey it, they broke into battle. Their masters cut their fight short since the contest hadn't started yet. Before the first round, the Black Order blew up the [[Avengers Mansion]] while the entire team was assembled there to prevent the heroes from becoming an obstacle.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 676}} The heroes survived, as they were teleported to safety at the nick of time by [[Va Nee Gast (Earth-616)|Voyager]].<!-- {{r|Avengers Vol 1 677}} -->

Once the game started, both teams were divided in half to confront each other for the possession of the two [[Pyramoids]] placed by their masters. Supergiant, Black Dwarf and Black Swan were pitted against the [[Gh'Ree and R'Hos Blood (Earth-616)|Blood Brothers]], [[Mentacle (Earth-616)|Mentacle]] and [[Molyn (Earth-616)|Metal Master]] in [[Rome (Italy)|Rome]], while Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive confronted [[Glah-Ree (Earth-616)|Captain Glory]], [[Drall (Earth-616)|Drall]] and [[Ferene (Earth-616)|Ferene the Other]] in Cusco. Both confrontations were intercepted by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 677}} The Black Order scored a point when Black Dwarf secured the Pyramoid in Rome, though he was teleported to the Grandmaster's Cosmic Game Room in such a manner it seemed like he had been disintegrated.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 678}} The round ended after the Pyramoid in Cusco was touched by the Avenger [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]], so both competing teams left to regroup and prepare.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 679}}

For the second round, the Black Order traveled to [[Antarctica]] to seize one of the two new Pyramoids. They were met by the Avengers and outpowered. Ebony Maw was knocked out by Voyager, Corvus Glaive was killed by Rogue and Supergiant was ambushed and killed through dissipation by the Lethal Legion's [[Ferene (Earth-616)|Ferene]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 680}} These loses forced the only remaining members of the Black Order on their feet, Proxima Midnight and Black Swan, to retreat while Ferene claimed the Pyramoid.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 681}} During the contest's final round, the last Pyramoid was teleported from its designated location to the [[Avengers Auxiliary Headquarters]] by the Grandmaster's secret agent, Voyager.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684}} Proxima Midnight and Black Swan followed the Challenger's own ace in the hole, the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], to the Pyramoid's new location,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 685}} but were defeated by the heroes left in the wake of Hulk's rampage.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 686}}

===The Grandmaster's Wager===
Following the victory of the Avengers, the Black Order minus Supergiant regrouped and escaped to the planet [[Angargal]], where they were approached by the Grandmaster with an offer:{{r|Avengers Vol 1 690}} to bring down the [[Sinnarian Empire]] by destabilizing the worlds under its rule. Thinking this would be a worthy challenge, the Black Order accepted. They were apprehended days after initiating their mission and put in jail to await their execution. The [[Resistance (Sinnarian) (Earth-616)|Resistance]] later broke the Black Order out of prison because of their shared goal and informed them about the [[Bow of Gabriel]], a cosmic weapon of the empire capable of bringing entire planets to heel in a matter of hours. Wanting to restore the [[Black Quadrant]] to its former glory and expand its reach to the entire universe, the Black Order started planning a way to steal the weapon instead of destroying it like the Resistance wanted.{{r|{{cl|Black Order Vol 1 1}}-[[Black Order Vol 1 2|2]]}}

[[File:Black Order Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
After the location of the rebel base was compromised by a spy, the rebel leader [[Krannig (Earth-616)|Peacemaker]] sent the Black Order to intercept a ship transporting an ultra-rare metal called [[Onducium]], which was needed to forge the arrows for the bow. Despite the attack of a mind-controlled [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]], they were able to secure the metal. Maw revealed himself to be the spy by disappearing soon after revealing the location of the new rebel base to [[Attican (Earth-616)|Emperor Attican]], resulting in the capture of Peacemaker.{{r|{{cl|Black Order Vol 1 3}}-[[Black Order Vol 1 4|4]]}} Corvus then became the Resistance's new leader and launched an attack on the empire. Meanwhile, Maw manipulated Attican into lowering [[Sinnar]]'s defenses, giving him the opportunity to steal the bow and reunite with the rest of his team. Corvus used the bow to turn everyone present, except for the Black Order, into twisted monsters. With their task complete, the Grandmaster arrived and explained he had bet with the emperor that his empire based on fear could be brought down by only five individuals. Having finally won his bet, he claimed the bow and left the Black Order to their next business.{{r|Black Order Vol 1 5}}

===[[Final Gauntlet|The Final Gauntlet]]===
Later, the Black Order was recruited by the Asgardian death goddess [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]] to recover the body of Thanos so she could resurrect him. Thanos' body was in the possession of Thanos' [[Eros (Earth-616)|Starfox]] who brought it with him to a meeting attended by major figures from across the universe to discuss Thanos' will. The group crashed the meeting using the space station [[Knowhere]] and a horde of Outriders. They successfully retrieved Thanos' body and dealt with the meeting's attendees by trapping them in an artificial rip in space. However, Thanos' head was missing, which prevented Hela from resurrecting him until it was recovered.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 1}}

Hela and the Black Order's search for Thanos' head first took them to the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]]. After Hela threatened the Collector, he directed her to the [[Negative Zone]] where the head was in the possession of [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]]. When confronted by Hela and the Black Order, Annihilus attacked them, but Hela chopped off his hand and threatened him, forcing him to hand over the head.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 3}}

[[File:Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 6 Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]
When the [[Dark Guardians (Earth-616)|Dark Guardians]] captured Gamora for believing that she was Thanos' means of resurrection, Hela and the Black Order took them out to prevent her execution. However, Hela revealed that she and Thanos had planned for his resurrection for a while and that Gamora wasn't to be Thanos' vessel, [[Eros (Earth-616)|Starfox]] was. After that, Thanos' consciousness took over Starfox's body and left with Hela and the Black Order for Knowhere, where his restored body was being kept for his resurrection.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 5}}

To stop Thanos' resurrection, the Guardians and remaining Dark Guardians attacked Knowhere. [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]], [[Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616)|Beta Ray Bill]], [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]], and [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-18897)|Captain Marvel (Phyla-Vell)]] subdued the Black Order while Gamora killed Starfox to stop Thanos' resurrection, but Thanos came back with a broken mind. Then Thanos was hit by a missile fired by Hela that generated a [[Glossary:Black Hole|black hole]], sucking up the two partners and all of Knowhere. The Guardians and Dark Guardians were able to escape.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 6}}

===Star===
Having somehow escaped the black hole, the Black Order went into hiding on Earth to reflect on independence, while realising they have become a family.{{r|Star Vol 1 5}} Disguised as [[Homo sapiens|humans]], they took up residence on [[East Village]]. While Corvus was away, Proxima Midnight ended up discovering the [[Reality Stone]] bonded to [[Ripley Ryan (Earth-616)|Ripley Ryan]], a former reporter who attempted to steal the powers of [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers)]], and alerted her teammates about it. Despite Black Swan not wanting to have anything to do with an Infinity Stone, it was ultimately decided that they would go after the Reality Stone when Corvus returned.{{r|{{cl|Star Vol 1 1}}-[[Star Vol 1 2|2]]}}

Tired of being a slave to the Infinity Stones or to those who wield them, Black Swan got to Ripley first and subdued her. She forced Ripley to accept a mysterious device of hers and to use the Reality Stone to speak and understand Swedish. She left as soon as Captain Marvel arrived, promising to return later.{{r|Star Vol 1 3}} When the Black Order attacked them again Star tried to use the device, but she accidentally used it on Corvus trapping him inside it. After [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] arrived Star used her powers to communicate with the Black Order and arranged a bargain, she would give back Corvus to them and in turn they would let her go. They agreed and after Star got rid of the Scarlet Witch and Captain Marvel gave the trapped Corvus back to them before she left.{{r|Star Vol 1 5}}
