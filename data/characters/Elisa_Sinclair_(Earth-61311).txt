| History                 = ===Origins===
When the sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] named [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]] first came to existence by the hand of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and manifested in the form of a scared child, it used her power of omnipresence to secretly seek the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|clone]] of the original [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]]. The Red Skull once had in his possession a Comic Cube that was eventually shattered by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. When S.H.I.E.L.D. used one of its fragments to create Kobik, its connection with the Red Skull passed on to Kobik. The Red Skull took advantage of Kobik's naivety to indoctrinate her in the ways of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] behind S.H.I.E.L.D.'s back. The Red Skull then executed his greatest scheme, and had Kobik turn Captain America into the best version of himself, which for Kobik entailed he had to be loyal to Hydra.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 2}}

To this end, Kobik used her omnipotent powers to create an [[Earth-61311|alternate timeline]] in which Steve Rogers was proselytized into Hydra when he was a kid.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}}{{r|Secret Empire Omega Vol 1 1}}

In this new timeline, Elisa Sinclair existed as a high-ranking member of the fascist organization [[Hydra (Earth-61311)|Hydra]]. A powerful sorceress, she claimed to have been in league with [[Elder Gods]] such as [[Chthon (Earth-61311)|Chthon]], which entailed the possibility she was virtually immortal.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 14}}

[[File:Elisa Sinclair (Earth-61311) from Captain America Steve Rogers Vol 1 3 001.jpg|thumb|left|Elisa in 1926]]
In 1926, Elisa was operating in [[New York City]], and recruited struggling housewife [[Sarah Rogers (Earth-61311)|Sarah Rogers]] into a local community run by Hydra.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 1}} Elisa envisioned an extremely important future was waiting for Sarah's young son [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Steve]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 5}} After ordering her men to kill Sarah's abusive husband [[Joseph Rogers (Earth-61311)|Joseph]],{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 3}} Elisa abducted Steve and brought him to a Hydra academy overseas called [[Keep (Hydra Base)|The Keep]]. Despite Steve's poor physical condition, Elisa vouched for him, claiming that he was the chosen one. Steve was left under the care of The Keep's instructor [[Sebastian Fenhoff (Earth-61311)|Dr. Sebastian Fenhoff]] and [[Daniel Whitehall (Earth-61311)|Daniel Whitehall]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 5}} Over the course of the following years, Rogers was indoctrinated into the ways of Hydra and became admired by Fenhoff and Whitehall for his academic skills and his dedication to Hydra's cause.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 7}}

===World War II===
A couple of years before WWII broke out, in 1936, Sinclair returned to The Keep to discuss with Fenhoff, Whitehall and Hydra's leader [[Heinrich Zemo (Earth-61311)|Heinrich Zemo]] the possibility of joining forces with [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-61311)|Nazi Germany]]. Elisa opposed [[Heinrich Zemo (Earth-61311)|Baron Heinrich Zemo]]'s desire to join forces with [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-61311)|Hitler]], thinking him of being nothing more than a power-hungry madman. Even though Elisa warned the alliance with Hitler would consume Hydra, she was ultimately outvoted. Sinclair additionally insisted Steve was the key to Hydra's plan that they had been waiting for, and not Hitler.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 8}}

The war erupted, and Hydra joined the war efforts against the Allies. Steve infiltrated the [[United States Army (Earth-61311)|United States Army]]'s [[Project Rebirth (Earth-61311)|Project Rebirth]], and eventually became the super-soldier [[Captain America]], and continued working as a spy for Hydra.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 12}} As part of his scheme to take over Hydra, Nazi officer [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-61311)|Red Skull]] had Zemo believe Elisa was a traitor.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 15}} Captain America tracked her down and confronted her in 1944, but Elisa pointed him to the true menace.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 14}}

After Steve confronted the Red Skull and discovered the Hydra he fought for no longer existed, Elisa approached him to bring direr news: The Allies were creating a reality-warping object known as a [[Cosmic Cube]] with which they intended to change history so they won the war. Elisa envisioned that Steve was going to survive the change and awaken in the new world decades into the future with the objective to restore the world as they knew it.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 16}} Because of this, Elisa sent Steve to the ancient city of [[Ashomia]] in [[Japan]] where he was shielded from the Allies' reality-warping.

In this way reality was changed into [[Earth-616|one]] where Hydra didn't win WWII, and Steve Rogers never served Hydra.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} While genuinely figthing alongisde the Allies,{{r|Captain America Comics Vol 1 1}} Captain America would become frozen in ice, and was awakened in the 21th Century by the superhero team known as the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], subsequently joining their ranks.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 4}} In truth, this is the way events naturally occured, until Kobik made it so it could be believed the timeline she fabricated, in which Captain America served Hydra, was the original.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}}

[[File:Elisa Sinclair (Earth-61311) from Captain America Steve Rogers Vol 1 12 001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Resurfaced in the present]]
===Present Day===
Months after Captain America supplanted his counterpart from this unfamiliar timeline, Elisa somehow resurfaced as well.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 13}} Taking up the mantle of [[Madame Hydra]], she assembled a new incarnation of the [[High Council of Hydra (Earth-616)|High Council of Hydra]] in preparation of Steve's eventual assumption as the new [[Supreme Hydra|Hydra Supreme]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 14}}

Madame Hydra reunited with Captain America after he killed the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Skull]], supporting him as launched a plan of conquest to take over the [[United States of America]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #16}} Weeks into Hydra's new regime, Rogers attacked [[Mount|The Mount]], the base of the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]], a coalition of American superheroes and civilians who opposed the new order. Following The Mount's evacuation, an [[Anthony Stark (Third A.I.) (Earth-616)|A.I. back-up]] of [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]'s mind activated a self-destruct mechanism within its [[Iron Man Armor Model 4|suit]] in an attempt to take Captain America with him. Madame Hydra intervened, and used a teleportation spell to save Steve's life at the cost of her own.{{r|Secret Empire #6}}

| Powers                  = '''Magic:''' Elisa appears to be a powerful witch, with the ability to cast believable illusions, such as when she made [[Sebastian Fenhoff (Earth-61311)|Sebastian Fenhoff]] feel and see that he had lost his tongue,{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #5}} and extend her longetivity.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #12}} She has claimed to have been in league with [[Elder Gods]] and [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]] himself.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #14}}
*'''The Sight:''' Elisa most notably possesses an ability of clairvoyance she referred to as "the sight."{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 8}} This power most likely allowed her to perceive Steve Rogers' potential when he was a kid.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 5}} Apparently, in moments of uncertainty, Elisa's power are much less effective. When Hydra was deciding whether to ally themselves with Hitler or not, Elisa admitted the future was unclear to her.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 8}}
| Abilities               = '''[[Martial Arts]]:''' Elisa possessed impressive fighting skills, being able to take out a man twice her size with ease.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #1}}
