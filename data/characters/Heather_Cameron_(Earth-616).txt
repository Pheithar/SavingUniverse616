Heather and [[Davis Cameron (Earth-616)|Davis Cameron]] were a lifeguard and a surfer, respectively, living in Surfer's Paradise in [[Australia]]. Unbeknownst to them, their father was an underworld crime lord known as [[Miles Warbeck (Earth-616)|Viceroy]], and upon his death, they were attacked.{{r|X-Treme X-Men #6}}

Together with [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] and [[Neal Shaara (Earth-616)|Thunderbird]], they managed to defeat their attackers. Heather discovered she was a [[Homo superior|mutant]] with the power to manifest whatever was necessary to save the life of someone in danger around her, including her own. Heather soon joined the splinter team of [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], and formed a romance with Thunderbird.{{r|X-Treme X-Men #7|9}}

During a mission to infiltrate the ship of the intergalactic warlord, [[Khan (Alien) (Earth-616)|Khan]], Heather's appearance changed to resemble the alien [[Shi'ar]] race, and it was theorized that she and Davis had some Shi'ar heritage. Her brother, unable to see past her new, alien appearance, left the team, and both Lifeguard and Thunderbird went in search of him.{{r|X-Treme X-Men #10|18}}

===After [[M-Day]]===
Lifeguard and Thunderbird turned up in [[Mumbai]], [[India]], helping out with the local [[X-Corporation (Earth-616)|X-Corporation]], until the catastrophic events of [[Decimation|M-Day]] and attacks on X-Corporation offices in Paris led Cyclops to call for the disbanding of all branches.

Heather was one of a handful of mutants to have retained her powers.{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}}

She was still involved with [[Neal Shaara (Earth-616)|Thunderbird]], and both were presumed to be still on the trail of Davis at the time of the [[Second Coming]].<ref>[[Neal Shaara (Earth-616)|Thunderbird (Neal Sharaa)]]'s entry in {{cl|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}}</ref>

Following the X-Men's [[Schism (Event)|Schism]], she joined the [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopian]] [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]'s Street Team in [[San Francisco]], but was never witnessed in action.<ref>Presented part of the team in {{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 1}}; never seen or mentioned.</ref>

Heather resurfaced in [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] as one of the many citizens of the mutant nation. She was seen hanging out with [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Jamie Madrox]] at the [[Green Lagoon]] bar.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 9}}

| Powers                  = 
*'''''Danger Detection Response:''''' She has the ability to register danger to human life in the vicinity and this automatically gives her the powers necessary to save those lives, be they her own or others.

*'''''Situational Biomorphic Adaptation (Nemesis Form):''''' According to the type of danger in the current situation, she automatically obtains the powers necessary to save those lives, be they hers or others. These powers and the forms she takes are determined by the situation she is in and adapts accordingly to the situation at hand. The variety of Lifeguard's power manifestations appear to be almost limitless. Heather becomes aware of how to use any power(s) she manifests after a few seconds. She can also manage more than one power at a time.

:Some of her displayed uses of this power are:

:* Growing Wings for Flight
:* Extra Arms for carrying and super-strength.
:* Skin turning into a sort of golden metallic armor
:* Gills for underwater breathing.
:* Legs into fish tail for better swimming ability
:* Upping her strength level from normal to Superhuman

*'''''Shi'ar Abilities:''''' Heather possesses some powers constantly after her royal Shi'ar half emerges. These include golden skin, claws, and the ability to grow wings, all when no-one is in danger.
