| History                 = Salamandra is the ex-wife of the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|The Wizard]] and mother of [[Cole Wittman (Earth-616)|Cole Wittman]]. She is considered the "Dragon's Daughter" apparently a woman that was given human form from an ancient dragon from [[K'un-Lun]].

When the Wizard met Salamandra and sought a romance with her but she rejected his advances. Eventually they struck a deal and Salamandra was artificially inseminated to carry a child. Due to the unnatural way she was produced, the child developed gravity based powers due to her father's use in anti-gravity fields.

Cole rapidly aged into adulthood and the Wizard eventually decided to use them for his [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]] scheme against the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] by having Cole become a love interest for [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Johnny Storm]].

The plan failed and they both turned against the Wizard and he decided to save his daughter from certain death.
