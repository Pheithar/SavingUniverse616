| History                 = While the fascistic [[Kree]] battled the [[Skrulls]] for millennia, radically warping a once-benevolent society into an ultra-militaristic state, on their own homeworld they also committed a near-total act of genocide against the [[Cotati]]. Only with the assistance of a small number of Kree who were members of a secretive pacifist sect the Priests of Pama did any Cotati survive at all, disguised as ornamental plants. As punishment for opposing the war-like society of the [[Kree]], the Priests of Pama were exiled to a small desolate prison planet. Eventually, [[Star Stalker]] arrived on the planet to feed on this planet and began to destroy it. The Priests successfully repelled the Star Stalker. Afterward, the Priests warned the [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]] of the Star Stalker's presence. The Supreme Intelligence allowed the Priests to scatter throughout the universe in pairs to inhabited planets to propagate and watch out for the [[Star Stalker]].{{r|Avengers #124}} On Earth, the Priests established a temple in what would become [[Vietnam]] and would become known as the Priests of Pama.{{r|Avengers #134}}

| Trivia                  = * It appears that the Priests of Pama had also settled on [[Titan (Moon of Saturn)|Titan]], since the monks of Shoa-Lorn had also trained [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]] to become the "[[Celestial Madonna]]", just like the priests have done with Mantis.{{r|Giant-Size Avengers Vol 1 4}}
* The Priests of Pama seemingly have a custom of referring to themselves in the third person as "This one" instead of "I," similarly to real-life Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism. This can be inferred from the fact that both [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]] (who was brought up by the Priests) and the [[Swordsman (Cotati) (Earth-616)|Cotati Elder]] (who also spent a significant part of his life at the Temple) spoke like that.{{r|Giant-Size Avengers Vol 1 4}}
