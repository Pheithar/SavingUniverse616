The [[Hatut Zeraze (Earth-616)|Hatut Zeraze]] ("Dogs of War") was formerly the nation's secret police; although it was officially disbanded, they continue to operate in what they believe is their homeland's best interest.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 4}}

They later developed [[Princess Regent Intelligence Division Executives (Earth-616)|P.R.I.D.E. (Princess Regent Intelligence Division Executives)]] as it's protection agency.{{r|Black Panther Vol 5 9}}

The Wakandans have a contingency plan for dealing with the "Devourer of Worlds" [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]].{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 14}}

===Politics and International Relations===
[[File:T'Challa_(Earth-616)_from_Black_Panther_Vol_4_2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Combat Ceremony]]
The Wakandan government is based on a pseudo-tribal society. The head of state is the '''[[Black Panther]]'''. In this role, the Black Panther is the King/Chieftain, religious leader, and commander-in-chief. The title, although it appears to be hereditary, can be challenged by any citizen of Wakanda for the right to rule in a combat ceremony.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 1}}

[[File:T'Challa_(Earth-616)_from_Black_Panther_Vol_4_3.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Taifa Ngao]]
Wakanda also has a council of tribal of elders; known as the [[Taifa Ngao (Earth-616)|Taifa Ngao]] to help with the decisions of day to day operations in the nation. They gather to advise the Black Panther on the future of their nation.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 2}} Following a governmental reformation, the [[Wakandan Constitutional Council (Earth-616)|Wakandan Constitutional Council]] transitioned the country from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 16}}

There are eighteen united tribes in Wakanda.{{r|Doomwar #1}}{{r|Marvel Atlas #2|; Wakanda's entry}}

The seat of government rules from the [[Royal Palace of Wakanda|Royal Palace]] located in [[Birnin Zana (Earth)|Birnin Zana]], the capital city.{{r|Marvel Atlas #2|; Wakanda's entry}}

[[File:Wakanda flag.png|thumb|left|200px|Old Flag of Wakanda]]
Since it's early tribal beginnings, Wakanda has been extremely isolationist. They did not invade or provoke any other nations, but if another entered their territory they would retaliate with deadly force.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 1}} They remained this way for thousands of years, until the modern era when they decided to join the global community. This is still a matter of contention for the Wakandan people.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 3}} This lead to the creation of the [[Desturi (Earth-616)|Desturi]], an ultra-conservative, xenophobic group who wished to return to their old isolationist ways.{{r|Black Panther Vol 5 7}}

Wakanda is now a member of the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]].{{r|Avengers #52}} This allows them to have political envoys across the globe such as the [[Wakandan Embassy (New York City)|Wakandan Embassy]] in [[New York City]].{{r|Black Panther #14}} 

===Education===
Education is highly valued in the Wakandan culture and was viewed as a fundamental building block to ancient Wakandans. The nation has one of the highest literacy rates on the planet. They have an eleven year free, compulsory cycle of primary and secondary education. At the end of this, the citizens of Wakanda have the choice in the future of their career path. Many go on to attend one of their free Universities. The citizens also have other options such as farming and mining and other such laboring professions.{{Citation}} 

Due to their isolationist nature, education outside the country was forbidden, meaning the crown prince T'Challa was the first ever to do so.{{r|Avengers #87}}

The Dora Milaje are trained and educated at their facility known as [[Upanga]].{{r|Black Panther: World of Wakanda #1}}

They also created the [[Wakandan School for Alternative Studies (Earth-616)|Wakandan School for Alternative Studies]], a special school for the meta-humans of Wakanda.{{r|Infinity: The Hunt #1}}

===Health===
Wakanda has a universal public health system paid largely from taxation. Wakanda's entire population has equal access to health care services.{{r|Doomwar #1}} The nation has one of the highest life expectancy rates on the planet.

From birth a citizen is provided with [[Kimoyo Beads]], this device regularly monitors the individual and provides a lifetime worth of medical knowledge.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 1}}

Wakanda has a cure for [[Glossary:Cancer|cancer]] but being isolationist they are reluctant to share it with the outside world. One of the members of the Wakandan counsel stated "If they care about their people's health they wouldn't sell cigarettes".{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 3}}

===Technology===
Wakanda's technology developed entirely independently of that of the rest of the world due to them remaining in isolation. The creation of methodologies of design are so different it's very difficult to use with outside technology.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 1}} Their computer technology is so advanced that it's almost impossible to hack. However, they have taken time to learn the technology of the rest of the world, allowing them to hack any external computer system.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 8}} Most of their technology has [[Vibranium]] as it's basis.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 53}} The Wakandans use advanced communication technology such as the [[Kimoyo Card]] and [[Kimoyo Beads]].{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 1}}

The Wakandans do not use fossil fuels, even though their land is rich in resources. Instead they utilize a variety of eco-friendly alternative sources such as solar, hydrogen and geothermal.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 1}}

Wakandan scientists split the atom almost a century before the rest of the world.{{r|Fantastic Four #607}}

Since the mid-20th century Wakanda employed sophisticated surveillance satellites, launched at a time when the [[United States of America|Americans]] and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviets]] were in the early stages of the space program.{{r|Avengers 1959 #3}}

===Religion===
The Wakandans have ties to the African gods, who were widely worshiped in [[Egypt]] but also had ties to other regions of Africa.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 #21|22}} This pantheon is known as [[Gods of Wakanda (Earth-616)|The Orishas]].{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 13}}{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 15}} Orisha is a [[Wikipedia:Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word that means spirit or deity.{{r|[[Wikipedia:Orisha|Orisha at Wikipedia]]}} The pantheon is composed of [[Gods of Egypt (Earth-616)|Gods of Egypt]]: [[Bast (Earth-616)|Bast]], the Panther Goddess, [[Thoth (Earth-616)|Thoth]], god of the moon and wisdom and [[Ptah (Earth-616)|Ptah]] the Trainer; [[Kokou (Earth-616)|Kokou]] is a "warrior [[Wikipedia:Orisha|Undergod]]" for the [[Wikipedia:Yoruba religion|Yoruba faith]] of [[Benin]] and [[Mujaji (Earth-616)|Mujaji]], goddess of sustenance is a "rain queen" from the [[Wikipedia:Lobedu people|Balobedu]]'s mythology.{{r|[http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Mi-Ni/Mujaji.html Mujaji at Myth Encyclopedia]}}

The [[Panther Habit|Panther uniform]] is a symbol of office as well as a religious vestment.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 30}}

As part of the cult's ceremonies, a chosen Black Panther is entitled to the use of a [[Heart-Shaped Herb]] that grants the person who consumes it enhanced strength, agility, and perception.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 24}}

[[File:Wakanda from Black Panther (film) 001.png|thumb|right]]
Wakanda is a country located in Africa. It is the source of most of the [[Vibranium]] used around the world. Wakanda was marked on a S.H.I.E.L.D. map of the world.{{r|Iron Man 2 (film)}} [[Ultron (Earth-199999)|Ultron]] purchased [[Vibranium]] which had been stolen by [[Ulysses Klaue (Earth-199999)|Ulysses Klaue]] from Wakanda.{{r|Avengers: Age of Ultron}}

A group of Wakandan delegates were accidentally killed in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] during one of the [[Avengers (Earth-199999)|Avengers]] missions. Because of this they signed the [[Sokovia Accords]]. At a U.N. meeting Black Widow met [[T'Challa (Earth-199999)|T'Challa]] and the current King [[T'Chaka (Earth-199999)|T'Chaka]]. The king was killed in an explosion. T'Challa originally believed that the [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-199999)|Winter Solider]] had planned the attack and sought to avenge his father, but relented when he met the true perpetrator [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-199999)|Helmut Zemo]] and refused to let vengeance consume him. He allowed Captain America and the Winter Soldier to find a refuge in Wakanda after his Civil War with Iron Man. He helped Bucky by putting him back in [[Cryostasis|Cryostasis Chamber]]. Bucky wished to remain under cryostasis until his brainwashing could be undone.{{r|Captain America: Civil War}}

===Marvel vs. Capcom series ([[Earth-30847]])===
[[File:Valkanda from Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite 001.jpeg|200px|right]]
The Earth-30847 version of Wakanda was caught up in the Convergence caused by [[Ultron Sigma (Earth-30847)|Ultron Sigma]], leaving the kingdom fused with the desert port town of [[w:c:monsterhunter:Val Habar|Val Habar]](Along with a good portion of its desert and the monsters therein, including the sand-swimming elder dragon [[w:c:monsterhunter:Dah'ren Mohran|Dah'ren Mohran]]). [[T'Challa (Earth-30847)|Black Panther]] still serves as the newly-formed kingdom's leader, with the land now being dubbed "Valkanda", and T'Challa taking on one of the town's top [[w:c:marvelvscapcom:Monster Hunter|Monster Hunters]] as an adjutant. The kingdom was sealed beyond the flow of time through use of the [[Time Stone]].

The Resistance sent a team to Valkanda in order to study the anomalies caused by the Convergence, but their craft was caught in a vortex and crashed, leaving [[w:c:streetfighter:Ryu|Ryu]] and the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-30847)|Hulk]] as the only two survivors. Another team was sent to Valkanda to obtain the [[Time Stone]] in order to fight Ultron Sigma, but they were followed by a legion of [[Ultron Sentinels|Ultron Drones]], who infected Dah'ren Mohran with the [[w:c:megaman:Sigma Virus|Sigma Virus]]. The dragon began an attack on the capital city or Valkanda, but was defeated by Ryu and the Hulk, leading Black Panther to hand over the Time Stone as thanks, removing the time barrier from around the kingdom.

After the defeat of Ultron Sigma, Wakanda and Val Habar remained permanently fused due to a crack made in the [[Reality Stone]] by [[Thanos (Earth-30847)|Thanos]] in a battle with Ultron Sigma.

===Ultimate Avengers 2: Rise of the Panther ([[Earth-60808]])===
On [[Earth-60808]], Wakanda is a country located in Africa, it is home to large amounts of Vibranium. [[Bruce Banner|Dr. Bruce Banner]] discovered that during a previous Chitauri attack, the Hulk had been able to smash through the Vibranium plated Chitauri ships without any effort. Because of this, he discovered that Vibranium turns brittle when exposed to [[Glossary:Gamma Radiation|gamma radiation]].{{r|Ultimate Avengers 2 (film)}}

| Notes                   = * A map of Wakanda was published in {{cl|Jungle Action Vol 2 #6}} that placed the nation on the coast of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], presumably on the west side of Africa. When that map was republished in {{cl|Jungle Action Vol 2 #8}} months later, that watery corner of the map was filled in by land, with merely an arrow pointing left towards the Indian Ocean. This retconning made Wakanda into an inland country closer to the east coast of Africa (presumably flipping the north / south axis of the map in order to accomplish this), a location that has been consistent in the years since, albeit with slight variations; while the Marvel Atlas points it as corresponding to Southwestern Ethiopia in the real world (see map above), the location of Wakanda in the ''Black Panther'' film corresponds, in real life, to Southwestern Uganda.
