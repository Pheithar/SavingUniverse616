His power negation made the mutants incapable of resisting when chosen for the Mutate bonding process.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #236}}

Following the abduction of several mutants by Genosha (orchestrated by [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]]), several teams of [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] invaded the island nation. Wipeout, however, was killed by the insane foreign consultant, Cameron Hodge.{{r|New Mutants #97}}
