He was a high school student{{r|Human Torch Vol 3 1}} before he was exposed to high levels of [[Glossary:Cosmic Radiation|cosmic radiation]] when older sister [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Sue Storm]]'s  boyfriend and scientist; [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Dr. Reed Richards]] took them and pilot [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Ben Grimm]], into space in the stolen rocket; [[Marvel-1]]. The radiation mutated him and his friends, turning  his entire body into a fiery, plasma-like state.{{r|Fantastic Four #1}} Together they became the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], a team of adventurers who explored [[Glossary:Space|space]], [[Glossary:Time|time]] and [[Glossary:Dimension|alternate dimensions]] and saved the world along the way from science-based threats.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 7}}

| History                 = <center>''This is an abridged version of Johnny Storm's history. For a complete history see '''[[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)/Expanded History|Johnny Storm's Expanded History]]'''''</center>

===Early Years===
Johnny Storm and his older sister, [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Sue]], lived uneventfully on [[Long Island]] until their mother, [[Mary Storm (Earth-616)|Mary Storm]], died in an automobile accident. Their father, [[Franklin Storm (Earth-616)|Franklin Storm]], a doctor, failed to save her. Despondent, Franklin descended into booze and gambling, eventually winding up in a penitentiary for murder.{{r|Fantastic Four #32}} The children went to live with their aunt Marygay. Growing up in suburban [[Glenville]], Johnny Storm was drawn to automobiles, despite his mother's death in a car accident, and became quite a mechanic at a young age.

While still a teenager, he selflessly rescued two of his friends from a burning building. No stranger to adventure, Johnny was nearly chosen as the human host of the demonic [[Zarathos (Earth-616)|Zarathos]], and was attacked by the legendary St. Germaine, who sought the power for himself. Johnny escaped the lure of Zarathos with the help of archaeologist [[Max Parrish (Earth-616)|Max Parrish]], the uncle of Cammy Brandeis, on whom Johnny had a bit of a crush.{{r|{{cl|Before the Fantastic Four: The Storms Vol 1 1}}-[[Before the Fantastic Four: The Storms Vol 1 3|3]]}}

[[File:Jonathan Storm (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 5 0001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Human Torch]]
===Fantastic Four===
Following his sister, Johnny became acquainted with her boyfriend, scientist [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]]. Reed planned to embark on a mission on the first faster-than-light rocketship to reach an Earthlike planet called [[Spyre]] located 44 lightyears away. After looking through the advanced scanner that Reed used to find this planet, Johnny was overcome by an impulse to join the mission, feeling that something was waiting for him out there.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 14}} Unbeknownst to Johnny, a denizen of Spyre named [[Kaila (Earth-616)|Kaila]] had also become affected by a similar sensation when she looked into the Earth from a similar device.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 16}} Johnny pushed himself through strenuous training and became the youngest pilot in [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Earth-616)|NASA]].

While originally enlisted as backup pilot, Johnny joined Reed, Sue and fellow pilot [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Ben Grimm]] on an unauthorized space flight aboard the ''[[Marvel-1]]''.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 14}} After take-off, the ship passed through a storm of [[Glossary:Cosmic Radiation|cosmic rays]] that caused the vessel to crash back to Earth. All four passengers were transformed by the radiation, with Johnny gaining the ability to envelop his body on fire. Calling himself Human Torch in tribute to the [[Human Torch (Android) (Earth-616)|World War II era hero]] of the same name, the youthful Johnny found new adventure as part of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], proving to be an invaluable if somewhat volatile member of the team.{{r|Fantastic Four #1}}

Falling out with his teammates after a battle with the [[Miracle Man (Earth-616)|Miracle Man]],{{r|Fantastic Four #3}} Johnny left the group and encountered amnesiac [[World War II]] hero [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. Recognizing Namor from comic books, Johnny dropped him into the sea, hoping to restore his memory. The plan worked, but after Namor found [[Atlantis]] in ruins, he declared war on humanity. Johnny rejoined the Fantastic Four and together they drove Namor back into the sea.{{r|Fantastic Four #4}} Later, the immature Johnny again considered quitting the Fantastic Four, this time to joining his cousin [[Bones (Earth-616)|Bones]]' circus, but quickly returned to the team.{{r|Fantastic Four #15}}

Though a member of the world-famous Fantastic Four, Johnny was still a teenage Glenville High student, albeit one who regularly clashed with super-powered menaces. Johnny even tried to conceal his dual identity from most of the locals at first, though this proved futile as the true identities of all four Fantastic Four founders were widely known almost from the start.{{r|Strange Tales #106}} In solo action (and sometimes assisted by his teammate the Thing or his sister), he fought the communist [[Charles Stanton (Earth-616)|Destroyer]]{{r|Strange Tales #101}} and [[Rabble Rouser (Weinberg) (Earth-616)|Rabble Rouser]];{{r|Strange Tales #119}} the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]];{{r|Strange Tales #102}}{{r|Strange Tales #105}}{{r|Strange Tales #110}}{{r|Strange Tales #118}} [[Zemu (Earth-6212)|Zemu]], Warlord of the 5th Dimension;{{r|Strange Tales #103}} [[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Paste Pot Pete]];{{r|Strange Tales #104}}{{r|Strange Tales #110}}{{r|Strange Tales #124}} [[Carl Zante (Earth-616)|Acrobat]];{{r|Strange Tales #106}}{{r|Strange Tales #114}} [[Wilhelm van Vile (Earth-616)|Wilhelm van Vile]], the enigmatic [[Wilhelm van Vile (Earth-616)|Painter of 1000 Perils]];{{r|Strange Tales #108}} the [[Dorian Murdstone (Earth-616)|Sorcerer]] of Glenville Woods;{{r|Strange Tales #109}} the [[Orson Kasloff (Earth-616)|Asbestos Man]];{{r|Strange Tales #111}} the original [[Leopold Stryke (Earth-616)|Eel]];{{r|Strange Tales #112}}{{r|Strange Tales #117}} the [[Samuel Smithers (Earth-616)|Plant Man]];{{r|Strange Tales #113}}{{r|Strange Tales #121}} the [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]];{{r|Strange Tales #115}} [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|the Puppet Master]],{{r|Strange Tales #116}} the modern-day pirate [[Captain Barracuda (Earth-616)|Captain Barracuda]], whom Johnny defeated in the first of several team-ups with his super-heroic elemental opposite [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]];{{r|Strange Tales #120}} the [[Terrible Trio (Earth-616)|Terrible Trio]],{{r|Strange Tales #122}} and the [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|Beetle]].{{r|Strange Tales #123}}

Super-villains, however, weren't Johnny's only rivals. Mike Snow, a member of the Glenville High wrestling squad, bullied Johnny until an accidental flare-up of the Torch's powers scarred Snow's face. Despite their animosity, Snow concealed the incident, blaming the injuries on a prank gone wrong and maintaining that Johnny had actually saved his life that night by flying him to the hospital.{{r|Human Torch Vol 3}} While Mike tried to move on with his life, Johnny did the same, dating fellow student [[Doris Evans (Earth-616)|Dorrie Evans]], although she eventually grew tired of his constant disappearances and broke it off. Johnny met another teenage hero, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], who broke into the [[Baxter Building]] hoping to impress the Fantastic Four.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #1}} They clashed when [[Reynard Slinker (Earth-616)|the Fox]] framed Spider-Man for stealing a Da Vinci painting.{{r|Strange Tales Annual #2}} Despite their early misunderstandings, the Torch had great respect for Spider-Man{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #18}} and the two eventually became good friends.

When the [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]], possessing the combined powers of the Fantastic Four, attacked the team, the Human Torch managed to trap him inside a cave,{{r|Fantastic Four #18}} but the Super-Skrull escaped and impersonated Franklin Storm. The Four exposed the Super-Skrull, but the Skrulls strapped a bomb to the real Franklin's chest, and Franklin sacrificed his own life to save his children.{{r|Fantastic Four #32}} A trip to the Skrull homeworld and the death of [[Morrat (Earth-616)|Warlord Morrat]], the Skrull who authorized Franklin's murder, brought some measure of revenge,{{r|Fantastic Four #37}} but this would not be the last time the Skrulls would interfere in Johnny's life.

[[File:Fantastic Four Vol 3 65 Textless.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Flame On!]]

===College===
After graduating high school, Johnny enrolled in [[Metro College]], where he befriended his roommate, [[Wyatt Wingfoot (Earth-616)|Wyatt Wingfoot]].{{r|Fantastic Four #50}} Wyatt joined Johnny and the Fantastic Four on a trip to [[Wakanda]], where they first encountered the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and helped him defeat [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Klaw]].{{r|Fantastic Four #52|53}}

Around this time, Johnny met the young [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]].{{r|Fantastic Four #45}} It was love at first sight, and Johnny, along with the rest of the Fantastic Four, helped her overthrow the mad Inhuman prince [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]].{{r|Fantastic Four #48}} Their love was passionate but short-lived, as Crystal returned to [[Attilan]] and married [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], the son of [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], eventually bearing his child. Johnny was crushed, but tried to move on. Hoping to catch up on old times with Dorrie Evans, he found that she had married and had two kids since they had broken up. Despite dropping out of Metro U, Johnny remained friends with Wyatt, who often participated in the Fantastic Four's adventures and was later romantically linked to the [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]].

When Johnny's sister Sue and her husband Reed were separated, Johnny joined the Thing, [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] and [[Thundra (Earth-715)|Thundra]] in a staged battle against the rehabilitated Namor in an effort to bring the couple back together. Their ploy worked, and Sue and Reed patched things up for good.

Seeking direction in his life, Johnny was tricked into attending the high-class Security College, a front for the [[Michel Berman (Earth-616)|Monocle]], an agent of the megalomaniac [[Enclave (Earth-616)|Enclave]], who used him to steal top-secret high-tech weapons. Spider-Man broke the Monocle's control of the Torch. Johnny then joined the rest of the Fantastic Four in space, where they helped the [[Champions of Xandar (Earth-616)|Champions of Xandar]] against the invading Skrulls. When Johnny's teammates were dying from a Skrull aging ray, Johnny destroyed the robotic assassin [[Skrull-X (Earth-616)|Skrull X]], allowing the infirm Reed to use his weapon to reverse the aging.

===Frankie Raye===
Hearing of the execution of David George Munson, his former high school classmate, Johnny helped the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]] clear his name and nabbed several leading members of the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] criminal organization, including [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]]. After a brief relationship with auto mechanic [[Lorrie Melton (Earth-616)|Lorrie Melton]], Johnny fell for [[Frankie Raye (Earth-616)|Frankie Raye]], a woman who was desperately afraid of his flames.{{r|Fantastic Four #164}}{{r|Fantastic Four #171}} Frankie eventually discovered that her pyrophobia stemmed from being hypnotized by her late stepfather, [[Phineas Horton (Earth-616)|Phineas Horton]] (creator of the android [[Human Torch (Android) (Earth-616)|Human Torch]]), into forgetting that he had accidentally given her flame powers of her own. Johnny helped Frankie adjust to her rediscovered powers as their relationship blossomed, but when [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] returned to Earth, Frankie agreed to follow him into space as his new herald, [[Frankie Raye (Earth-616)|Nova]]. Distraught, Johnny was comforted by Frankie's former roommate, [[Julie Angel (Earth-616)|Julie Angel]], and began to have feelings for her. Confusing matters further, Julie's friend, [[Sharon Selleck (Earth-616)|Sharon Selleck]], had a crush on Johnny. Julie eventually moved to [[California (State)|California]] to continue her acting career, and nothing came of Sharon's crush.

===Marriage===
Johnny was briefly abducted by agents of the [[Alden Maas (Earth-616)|Messiah (Alden Maas)]] in his mad plot to expand the Earth by super-heating its core. Brought to [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]] by the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] during the [[Marvel Super Heroes: Secret Wars|Secret Wars]] and forced to battle various super-villains, Johnny met and was healed by [[Zsaji (Earth-616)|Zsaji]], a native of the planet. Physically but not emotionally attracted to Zsaji, Johnny found an unlikely rival in [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], who fell in love with the healer. Although Zsaji returned Johnny's affection at first, she eventually chose Colossus over the Torch, but then sacrificed her own life to rescue several dying heroes.

Johnny returned to Earth, where he found himself drawn to [[Alicia Masters (Earth-616)|Alicia Masters]], the long-time girlfriend of Johnny's then-absent Fantastic Four teammate, the Thing. Johnny and Alicia's romance helped estrange the Thing from the Fantastic Four for a lengthy period. Johnny hit his lowest point when Tommy Hanson, a young fan of his, set himself on fire in an attempt to be more like his hero. Hearing of the boy's death, Johnny considered retiring as the Human Torch, but the Beyonder managed to talk him out of it.{{r|Fantastic Four #285}} Eventually Johnny married Alicia, but a jealous Thing offered a spot in the Fantastic Four to Crystal, who was separated from Quicksilver at the time. Johnny's old feelings for Crystal slowly returned, but his love for Alicia enabled him to resist temptation, and Crystal eventually left the team.

Despite their long and intimate relationship, Johnny was horrified to discover that the Alicia he loved and married was not the true Alicia Masters, but a Skrull imposter named [[Lyja (Earth-616)|Lyja]]. Originally sent to infiltrate and destroy the Fantastic Four, Lyja truly fell in love with Johnny and joined the Fantastic Four in confronting [[Paibok (Earth-616)|Paibok]], the Skrull who had kidnapped the real Alicia. Lyja seemingly sacrificed her life to protect Johnny, but her former lover Paibok nursed her back to health. Trying to move on from yet another failed relationship, Johnny enrolled at [[Empire State University]]; but [[Devos (Earth-616)|Devos]], Paibok, and even Lyja attacked Johnny at ESU, forcing his powers to go nova, burning down a large section of the campus.{{r|Fantastic Four #371}} Johnny briefly became a fugitive until Reed agreed to sell some of his patents to pay for the damages. Lyja returned to Johnny's life again, tricking him into believing she was carrying his baby. When this proved a lie as well, Johnny left her again.

===Continuing Adventures===
Johnny briefly joined his nephew [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin]]'s [[Fantastic Force (Earth-616)|Fantastic Force]] team, where he battled his virtually omnipotent extra-dimensional counterpart [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-721)|Vangaard]] (formerly Gaard), convincing him to abandon his mission of eliminating redundant realities by showing him the hero he could become.{{r|Fantastic Force #12}} Lyja posed as student Laura Green and dated Johnny to stay close to him; Johnny recognized her when they kissed though he didn't share this until later, but the two never had the chance to explore their true feelings.

After Franklin Richards created [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Counter-Earth]] and rescued the Fantastic Four, Avengers, and several other heroes from death at the hands of [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], [[Roma (Otherworld)|Roma]] deemed Franklin too powerful to ignore, and sent [[Technet (Multiverse)|Technet]] and the [[Captain Britain Corps (Multiverse)|Captain Britain Corps]] to retrieve him. The Human Torch convinced Roma that Franklin's family, the Fantastic Four, would be able to nurture him so that he would not grow up to be a danger to the Omniverse.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 #6|8}}

While the rest of the Fantastic Four battled the Gideon Trust and [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]] in the [[Negative Zone]], Johnny was forced to recruit a temporary Fantastic Four team consisting of [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man (Scott Lang)]], Johnny's on-and-off girlfriend [[Namorita Prentiss (Earth-616)|Namorita]] (Namor's cousin), and the She-Hulk, who battled the Gideon Trust on Earth.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 43}} When the cosmic entity [[Abraxas (Multiverse)|Abraxas]] came to Earth-616, Johnny teamed with an [[Frankie Raye (Earth-1462)|extra-dimensional version of the now-deceased Frankie Raye]] to retrieve the [[Ultimate Nullifier (Weapon)|Ultimate Nullifier]], a weapon powerful enough to destroy Abraxas. This Nova betrayed Johnny and gave the Nullifier to her master, Abraxas, but even that couldn't save Abraxas after Galactus joined the fight. Following the battle, Susan found herself pregnant again, and, with Reed off battling the Hidden Ones, Johnny was forced to seek help from Dr. Doom when problems with the pregnancy threatened Sue's life. Doom saved both Sue and her daughter, [[Valeria Richards (Earth-616)|Valeria]].

Seeking an acting career, Johnny was cast as the Rawhide Kid in a summer blockbuster; but it was eventually decided he wasn't ready for the role, which was given to Lon Zelig (actually the Super-Skrull). Johnny also spent some time as a firefighter at the behest of his former classmate, Mike Snow; but when Snow moved away after his wife turned out to be a psychotic arsonist and seemingly died, Johnny left the job (though he later returned to the profession during a period when the Fantastic Four was short on cash). Sick of her brother's directionless life, Sue forced him to take a job as the Chief Financial Officer for Fantastic Four, Inc. Although initially in over his head, Johnny was able to stop a manufacturer from stealing the secret of Reed's [[Unstable Molecules|Unstable Molecule]] suits, and began to warm up to both the job and his co-worker, Jian Fetta.

Unfortunately, after a major battle with Doom, Reed attempted to claim [[Latveria]] for the Fantastic Four, an act that turned the United States government against them. To escape trial, the group was forced to sell many of their patents and holdings to the government, which left Johnny's wallet much emptier than usual and sent his popularity plummeting. Seeking help from the least popular person he could think of, Johnny contacted Spider-Man, who tried to cheer Johnny up by bringing him to a water park, where they were attacked by [[Morris Bench (Earth-616)|Hydro-Man]]. Easily defeating the villain and rescuing the park's popular mascot, Johnny found his popularity rising once more. Johnny also began to converse with a new girl over the internet and hit it off when he finally met her. This girl, Cole, turned out to be the daughter of one of Johnny's oldest enemies, the Wizard; but although she was sent to trick the Fantastic Four, Cole actually helped lead them to the Wizard's lair, where they battled him and his new [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]]. The Wizard escaped and took Cole with him, but Johnny remained hopeful about meeting her again.

An alien named Zius later came to Earth, the location of the one being in the universe who could nullify his Galactus-proof planet-cloaking invisibility shield, Susan Richards. Zius threatened to destroy the planet if Sue did not sacrifice herself, but Reed used his power gun to switch her powers with Johnny's and tricked Zius into leaving the planet. As he left orbit, Galactus destroyed Zius's spaceship and claimed Johnny as his new [[Heralds of Galactus (Earth-616)|Herald]]. Unwilling to lead Galactus to populated worlds, Johnny used his new powers to analyze Galactus and, with the help of the Fantastic Four and [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]], managed to transform Galactus back into humanoid form. Johnny's power cosmic faded, but during Reed's subsequent efforts to reverse Sue and Johnny's power switch, a remnant of the power caused a flare-up that temporarily sent the Fantastic Four's powers into four random New Yorkers.

===[[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]]===
The super-human [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]] split the team once again. Johnny was beaten into a brief coma during a visit to a nightclub, sparked by anger over the [[Stamford]] disaster.{{r|Civil War #1}} When he finally awoke none of his teammates were there to greet him due to their duties of helping [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]'s pro-registration faction. After the death of [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Bill Foster]]{{r|Civil War #4}} during a battle between the two factions, Johnny went with his sister, Sue, to join [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]'s "[[Secret Avengers (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]]". Through [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]'s connections, the two were given new identities as husband and wife, which they accepted (with understandable reluctance).{{r|Civil War #5}}

At the end of the Civil War, Johnny and Sue returned to the Fantastic Four. Johnny and the Thing continued to serve on the team again, but this time with the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and his new wife [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] filling in while Reed and Sue took some time to reconcile.{{r|Fantastic Four #543}}

===Secret Invasion===
During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], a Skrull invaded the Baxter Building, posing as Sue, and sent it into the [[Negative Zone]], with Johnny, Ben, Franklin and [[Valeria Richards (Earth-616)|Valeria]] inside. When Johnny confronted the Skrull, she revealed herself to be his old flame, Lyja, who had been trying to keep them out of harm's way. When Ben, Johnny, Franklin, Val, and the [[Phineas Mason (Earth-616)|Tinkerer]] were ready to leave the Negative Zone she refused to leave, because she wanted to find out who she was.{{r|{{cl|Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four Vol 1 1}}-[[Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four Vol 1 3|3]]}}

===Death & Return===
[[File:Jonathan Storm and Annihilation Wave (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Vol 1 587 0001.jpg|thumb|right|The Death of Johnny Storm]]
While Reed and Sue were gone from the Baxter Building of their own important missions, a group known as the [[Cult of the Negative Zone (Earth-616)|Cult of the Negative Zone]] successfully made their way into the building and breached the portal to the Negative Zone. Once inside, the cult managed to unleash what seemed to be an endless army of [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]] [[Arthrosian|Insectoid Soldiers]] upon Johnny, the currently powerless Ben, and the kids of the [[Future Foundation (Earth-616)|Future Foundation]]. Franklin revealed that he had his powers back by destroying the army and the group pushed into the [[Negative Zone]], where the only way to hold the army off from getting through the door was to lock the door from their side and randomize the code so no one could get in or out. Ben was prepared to make the sacrifice, but Johnny threw him through the portal as he regained his powers.{{r|Fantastic Four #587}} Johnny used his nova flame, but still couldn't burn the whole army and was captured. Annihilus demanded that Johnny opened the portal to Earth, but he refused and was killed.{{r|Fantastic Four #600}} 

[[File:Light Brigade (Earth-616), Jonathan Storm (Earth-616) and Annihilus (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Vol 1 600 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Johnny with the [[Light Brigade (Earth-616)|Light Brigade]] and enslaved [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]]]]
Three times Johnny was resurrected by worms-healers, but every time he burned them before they had time to recover his body and he died again and again. Finally, worms have been able to recover his body, and Johnny was sent to prison, where he met with the [[Light Brigade (Earth-616)|Light Brigade]]. Together they escaped, attacked Annihilus and Johnny took away his [[Cosmic Control Rod]]. After that Johnny opened a portal to the [[Baxter Building]] and they all returned to [[Earth]].{{r|Fantastic Four #600}}

Then Johnny gathered the team drawing with fire the symbolical "4" at the sky above the Baxter Building. Reed, Sue, Ben and Peter boarded one of the Annihilation Wave's ships controlled by Johnny, who used the rest of the ships to battle the Kree army until the Inhumans asked to finish them by their own hand.{{r|Fantastic Four #602}} Meanwhile the other heroes on Earth where dealing with the scraps of the battle which could damage the Earth, Reed and Sue summons Galactus, who destroys completely the Kree army. That moment, the [[Celestials (Race)#Mad Celestials (Earth-4280)|Mad Celestials]] appeared to destroy this universe. Although the team tried to use the Hub (a weapon of mass destruction created by the Reeds), they couldn't defeat the Mad Celestials. Then, a future version of [[Franklin Richards (Earth-10774)|Franklin]] and [[Valeria Richards (Earth-10774)|Valeria]] appeared as part of [[Nathaniel Richards (Earth-616)|Nathaniel Richards]]'s plan.{{r|Fantastic Four #603}} The Future Franklin used his power to heal Galactus and destroy the Mad Celestials, saving the day.{{r|Fantastic Four #604}} Later, the Baxter Building was easily rebuilt, Mr. Fantastic showed a new secondary headquarters called [[Foundation (Space Station)|Foundation]] and new costumes were given to the members of the Future Foundation, as part of the reformation of the Fantastic Four.{{r|FF #16}}

When New York was invaded by monsters from the Counter-Earth, Johnny Storm sacrificed his powers in order to stop them.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 2}} He managed to partially cope with the loss of his powers and focused on his musical career.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 3}} During a second invasion caused by the [[Quiet Man (Earth-616)|Quiet Man]], Johnny was helping some of the allies of the Fantastic Four escape from the Counter-Earth when the portals from it were closed by Mister Fantastic. The resulting radiation gave Johnny his powers back.{{r|Fantastic Four #645}}

===The Bearing of a Legacy===
When the universe, and the entirety of the [[Multiverse]], came to an end as a consequence of a phenomena known as [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]], Reed Richards was one of the few survivors.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 1}} Following a subsequent adventure in [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]], Reed took omnipotent power from Battleworld's creator Doctor Doom and began to restore the Multiverse together with Sue and most of the Future Foundation.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 9}} Since he knew Doom would eternally resent him, Reed altered his memories to make him think he was dead, hoping Victor would become a better man if he didn't pursue ultimate power and also believed his greatest rival to be gone. Reed decided to also alter the memories of the Human Torch and The Thing, leaving them behind on Earth-616 with Victor so they could keep him in check,{{r|Marvel 2-In-One Annual Vol 1 1}} while the rest of the Future Foundation went on a journey creating and charting new universes.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 9}} Since Ben and Johnny believed the rest of their family to be dead, the Fantastic Four were disbanded.{{r|Marvel 2-In-One Vol 1 1}}

The only remaining members of the Fantastic Four, Johnny and Ben, parted ways. Johnny started working with the Inhumans, and had a short-lived romance with Medusa herself,{{r|Uncanny Inhumans Vol 1 1}} though it eventually fell apart when she attempted to return to her estranged husband Black Bolt.{{r|IVX Vol 1 6}} The Human Torch had joined the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]] as a representative of the Inhumans along with telepath [[Emily Guerrero (Earth-616)|Synapse]],{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 1}} and remained as part of the team even after stopping collaborating with the Inhumans. During this time, Johnny grew close to the team's de facto leader [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 26}} However, this quickly ended after his apparent death and when Rogue rekindled her relationship with Gambit.{{r|Rogue & Gambit Vol 1 3}}

Not long afterwards, Johnny gained full possession of Reed's patents and licensing fee settlements as his sole living heir, becoming a billionaire. He decided to invest that money in a series of charities and bursaries to support the development of a better world. He additionally bought the abandoned [[Avengers Mansion]], which had become the headquarters of the Unity Division, establishing a company to manage the building and its staff.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 28}}

===Fate of the Four===
In order to help Johnny cope with the loss of their family, Ben convinced him to go on a multiversal journey using the [[Multisect]], claiming that the device could help them find their family.{{r|Marvel 2-In-One Vol 1 1}} During their journey, Johnny found out that Ben didn't actually believe the rest of their family was alive.{{r|Marvel 2-In-One Vol 1 8}} The duo eventually returned to their native universe empty-handed, though Johnny started to hold the wishful belief that his family wasn't gone.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 1}} Ben and Johnny were reunited with Reed, Sue and the rest of the Future Foundation after Reed summoned them to help them fight a powerful being called the [[Griever at the End of All Things (Multiverse)|Griever at the End of All Things]] who repudiated the Future Foundation's mission of creating new universes, and confronted the team as soon as Franklin was depleted of his ability to create entirely new realities.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 2}} After the Griever was driven away, the Future Foundation continued their multiveral travels, but Reed, Sue, Franklin and Valeria returned with Ben and Johnny to Earth.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 3}}

Shortly after the return of the Fantastic Four, Reed sought to resume the team's first flight and Johnny helped him build the ''[[Marvel-2]]'', a re-creation of the original rocketship.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 14}} When the Fantastic Four reached their original destination, the planet Spyre, they faced a group of superpowered protectors named the [[Unparalleled (Earth-616)|Unparalleled]], who had been imbued with cosmic radiation to face the Fantastic Four. Spyricans had been aware of the team's initial failed attempt to reach their planet and had prepared for a second try.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 15}} The Human Torch encountered Kaila, who had become the winged member of the Unparalleled named Sky, and they recognized the connection between each other.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 16}} The Fantastic Four initially became at odds with the patriarch of Spyre, the [[Revos (Earth-616)|Overseer]], after discovering that he had been responsible for the cosmic ray storm that gave them powers during their first flight due to an attempt to scuttle their mission.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 17}} After making peace with the Spyricans, the Fantastic Four returned to Earth, and they were joined by Sky, who decided to try to make her destined relationship with Johnny work.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 19}}

Despite Johnny's eventual commitment to his relationship with Sky,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 30}} Johnny cheated on her with [[Zora Vukovic (Earth-616)|Zora Vukovic]], the alter-ego of Latverian champion Victorious. Victorious was subsequently proposed to by Doctor Doom in a political move to entrust Latveria with a queen.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 32}} The Fantastic Four were invited to the ceremony and Zora ended up admitting her fling with Johnny at the altar.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 33}} Doom lashed out in response and used a machine called the [[Armagedron]] to bombard Johnny with concentrated cosmic rays, overloading his powers so that he couldn't turn off his flame.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 34}}

===Relationships===
Johnny has been in relationships with; [[Doris Evans (Earth-616)|Dorrie Evans]],{{r|Strange Tales #113}} [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]],{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 105}} [[Frankie Raye (Earth-616)|Frankie Raye]],{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 244}} [[Zsaji (Earth-616)|Zsaji]],{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 4|6}} [[Lyja (Earth-616)|Lyja]],{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 300}} [[Namorita Prentiss (Earth-616)|Namorita]],{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 42}} [[Kourtney Keaton (Earth-616)|Kourtney Keaton]],{{r|4 Vol 1 1}} [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]],{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 1|30}}{{r|Avengers Vol 1 679}} [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]],{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 26}} and [[Kaila (Earth-616)|Sky]],{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 15}} among many other shorter relationships.

| Powers                  = 
[[File:4 Vol 1 29 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Human Torch]]
'''Pyrogenesis:''' The Human Torch possessed the mental ability to control ambient heat energy and the physical ability to transform his entire body, or portions of his body into a fiery, plasma-like state of will. The cells of a normal human body convert energy from foodstuffs into a form of energy usable by the body, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Among other mutagenic changes, the cosmic ray bombardment triggered a specific genetic code rearrangement that caused the Human Torch's ATP production sites to generate a new form of energy containing molecule. (Reed Richards has dubbed this molecule adenine ribo-heptaphosphine, AR-HP.) This complex molecule not only provides ordinary bodily energy but contains large stores of latent chemical-bonding energies. Another favorable mutagenic change is his cells' ability to utilize this extra energy by converting it into a moderate-density, plasma-like state that is regulated by a subconscious mental field and can be modified by an act of will. When sufficient quantities of energy are consumed, the Torch unavoidably reverts to his solid state.
* '''Plasma Form:''' The Human Torch possesses the physical ability to envelop his entire body or portions of his body with fiery plasma without harm to himself (plasma is a super-heated stated of matter such as exists in the atmosphere of stars). Ordinarily, when aflame, the Human Torch is enveloped by a low-intensity flame of low-level plasma (reddish, approximately 780 Fahrenheit), which ranges from 1 to 5 inches from his body. He can, however, generate much higher levels and flames about himself. The energy used to support his low-level plasma is small; only when the Human Torch wills his flame to a higher level does the majority of surplus energy with the AR-HP complex become involved. In its plasma state, The Torch's body is no longer solid; projectiles that are not melted pass harmlessly through his body.
* '''[[Pyrokinesis]]:''' The Human Torch can generate shapes composed of fire from any point on his body (he usually employs his hands to "sculpt" the flames, occasionally as a lasso to ensnare enemies). He can form fire into long streams, spheres, or even more complex shapes like letters in skywriting. These flames-objects will only remain their shapes as long as he concentrates upon them. The objects will only burn about 3 minutes before expiring unless the Torch continues to infuse them with energy. The temperature of these fiery projections is generally around 2,800 F (near the melting point of iron).
* '''Nova Flame:''' The Torch refers to his highest, hottest levels of plasma that he can create as his "nova flame." The exact temperatures that his "nova flame" can attain are not known. At an average rate of expenditure of energy, the Torch can stay aflame for about 16.8 hours. In his younger days, he could only maintain his flame for much briefer periods, and sometimes exhausted it while in combat. He cannot maintain his "nova flame" for as long a time as he can maintain his ordinary flame. The Torch can release all of his body's stored energy in one intense, omni-directional "nova-burst," which can reach about 1,000,000 F, and which is similar to the heat-pulse of a nuclear warhead detonation, with an area of total devastation of about 900 feet in diameter and the power of a super nova. (The Torch has claimed that he can destroy a small moon with his nova-flame.) This violent discharge uses his entire reserve of energy (except for the necessary to keep him alive) at once, entirely exhausting his flame power. He generally requires at least 12 hours to recover entirely from such a feat.
* '''[[Flight]]:''' The Human Torch's plasma has a high hydrogen content, and is surrounded by an exuded cloud of mono-atomic hydrogen atoms. The hot cloud provides sufficient positive buoyancy for him to float. With mental stimulation of his flame, he can provide enough lift to carry around 180 pounds. By forming a jet from his feet, directed behind him, he can achieve a normal flight speed of 140 miles per hour, and accelerate up to supersonic speeds capable of catching up with faster beings such as the [[Silver Surfer]] while in the Earth's orbit. He can also discharge concussive blasts of heat most notably in the case of his human candle punch.
*'''Thermokinesis:''' The Human Torch has the ability to mentally control the ambient heat energy within his immediate environment, even when he himself is not aflame. He can reduce objects' temperatures (if they are in a normal range for existing on Earth's surface) to about 30 F, raise them to several hundred degrees, or extinguish open flames. His radius of influence is about 80 feet. The heat energy he takes from the environment is absorbed into his own body. If he takes in a critical amount while he is not aflame, he will become aflame. There are unknown limits to the amount of flame he can absorb into his own body harmlessly while he is himself aflame.
*'''Superhuman Durability:''' The Human Torch is surprisingly, and extremely durable. He was able to to shake off a punch from [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]],{{r|Fantastic Four #249}} and has taken multiple punches from Namor.
*'''Immunity to Fire & Heat:''' The Human Torch is unaffected by heat and flames, including his own, even when part of him is aflame and the rest of him is not. His flesh cannot be scalded or burned by any heat source whose level is below that of his maximum output.
*'''Cold Resistance:''' Human Torch seems to have a degree of resistance to cold. When he was in Antarctica, all he could do was a jacket, a bathing suit, and some cowboy boots and even swam in the water of Antarctica - and he showed no signs of cold or discomfort at all.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 576}}

* '''Energy Absorption:''' While imbued with the Power Cosmic, Human Torch was able to absorb Antithesis' energy from the possessed victims of the cosmic being.
* '''Cryokinesis:''' While imbued with the Power Cosmic, Human Torch was also able to produce ice.

| Abilities               = '''Expert Mechanic:''' An expert mechanic since his teens, Johnny was able to totally overhaul a car's transmission by the age of 15.  
His design and mechanical acumen went into the creation of the Fantasticar Model-2 

Johnny also has experience as a professional race car driver.
| Strength                = The Human Torch possesses the normal human strength of a man of his age, height, and build who engages in moderate regular exercise.
| Weaknesses              = '''Energy Depletion:''' At an average rate of expenditure of energy, the Torch can maintain his plasma state for about 16.8 hours before he is forced to revert to his solid state. 

'''Physical Condition:''' The Human Torch's physical condition (health, injury or exhaustion) also limits his flame's duration. 

'''Fire Extinguishing:''' The Human Torch's flame is supported by the presence of oxygen, and thus is extinguished in low air pressure or a vacuum. The Torch's flame can be extinguished by smothering materials, such as water, sand, fire-fighting foam, and heat-resistant blankets, unless his flame is at such an intensity that it immediately vaporizes such materials on contact. If hit with small amounts of water, up to about five gallons, the Torch can turn it to steam with relatively little effort. More water than that could extinguish his flame at its normal level, and he would have to wait until he could evaporate the residual moisture before re-ignition.

'''Fantastic Four Power Synergism:''' The original members of the Fantastic Four are tethered to each other, and act as as their own conduits of power. They can be apart within their own universe and retain a connection, but prolonged periods cut off from each other in other universes result in a gradual decline in power levels. If they spend too much time separated this way, they would eventually become powerless.{{r|Marvel 2-In-One Vol 1 3}}

'''Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder:''' After being painfully killed and resurrected for over two years by Annihilus,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 600}} Johnny was still haunted by the memories of those events.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Fantastic Four Vol 1 1}}

<big>'''Fantastic Four Uniforms'''</big>
{{Main|Fantastic Four Uniforms}}

The Human Torch's costume, and the rest of his wardrobe, is constructed of [[Unstable Molecules|unstable molecules]], which are attuned to his powers, allowing it to become burst into flame when he does. The Human Torch's costume has a complete data processing and telemetry system woven into its fabric on a molecular level, making it a wearable computer. The costume forms a network with the rest of the Fantastic Four, providing a constant, real time uplink of everyone’s physical condition as well as their location and current situation. The costume is capable of displaying data and has touch-pad controls on the gauntlets. Its sensors can track all of the team’s uniforms and provide a picture of their immediate vicinity. The costume has an intricate scanner system which can detect things around the wearer, from how many people are in the next room to what dimension or planet they are on.
