| Quotation               = It was the spark that started the fire -- a legend that grew in the telling. After the light. Before the war. And before the fall. They were the last days of the great idea -- an Avengers world. We were final options. We were last resorts. We were world builders and world breakers. And in the last days of life, before a season of death... we were Avengers.

| History                 = Kevin Connor{{r|Avengers Vol 5 8}} was a young ignored but excellent student from college. When a strange anomaly affected the [[Superflow]] of [[Earth-616]], he was given the power of the [[Star Brand (Object)|Star Brand]] during the [[White Event]]; his transformation caused him to annihilate the whole college. The Avengers later arrived to investigate the event, as guided by [[Adam Blackveil (Earth-616)|Nightmask]] and [[Tamara Devoux (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 7}}

After he faced the Avengers, Kevin Connor was taken by Nightmask to Mars, in order to seek for help to [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]], in the meantime, he explained Starbrand what caused his powers and his purpose.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 8}} On Mars, Ex Nihilo revealed the conflict of the White Event was caused by his attempts to make Earth sentient.
[[File:Avengers Vol 5 9 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]
Nightmask teleported Connor and himself to Croatia, one of the places modified by Ex Nihilo, where strange creatures started forming a brain-like structure. The "brain" tied to absorb Nightmask, but was rescued by Starbrand, who accidentally killed the organism in the process, "killing the Earth." The Avengers arrived to the scene and tried to stop them, who fought back until Starbrand surrendered. As they were out of options, the heroes decided it would be better for the world to put Kevin away from it, in Stark's [[wikipedia:Dyson Sphere|Dyson Sphere]] under construction, in the company of Nightmask.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 9}}

When [[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]] sensed a new threat coming to Earth, she advised the Avengers to recruit him and Nightmask into the team, which they did.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 17}} Starbrand aided the Avengers in the [[Infinity (Event)|Builder war]], even devastating an entire Builder fleet.{{r|Infinity #3}}

===Time Runs Out===
After the Avengers fell into S.H.I.E.L.D. authority, Starbrand and Nightmask left the team to investigate the decay of the universe. They returned to Earth when they received a message from [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]], inviting them to join [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|his own Avengers team]] as there had been new progress on the research related to the [[Glossary:Incursion|Incursions]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}}

Using [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]]'s resources, Sunspot managed to put into operation a machine capable of transporting individuals across the [[Multiverse]], in hopes of finding the source of the decay of the Multiverse, and a group of them, the "Multiversal Avengers," embarked in said mission. Starbrand was among these heroes.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 36}}
[[File:Kevin Connor (Earth-616) from Avengers World Vol 1 19.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Starbrand's new suit]]
In their journey, the Multiversal Avengers arrived to the base of the [[Black Priests (Multiverse)|Black Priests]], whom they believed to be enemies, as they would destroy alternate Earths. After discovering their true motivation, that of saving the Multiverse, the Multiversal Avengers allied with the Black Priests, and were informed of the true enemies they had to face, the [[Beyonders|Ivory Kings]] and [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Rabum Alal]]. While the Black Priests tried to find Rabum Alal, the Multiversal Avengers would set out to find the Ivory Kings (also known as the Beyonders).{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 27}}

The Avengers traveled across numerous universes, navigating the map left by the [[Mapmakers (Multiverse)|Mapmakers]]. After one last jump across universes that cost Nightmask's life, the Avengers found themselves face to face with a fissure in time and space. From it, two [[Beyonders]] emerged and demanded the heroes to fall back. Upon denying their request, the Avengers faced the Beyonders. During the fight, Starbrand was stabbed by one of the Beyonders, Kevin used his last breath to unleash the energy within him and destroy it.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 32}}

===All New All Different===
When the universe came back to life, so did Kevin and the rest of its inhabitants, with no memory of their temporary demise. After defeating Blizzard in China, he was offered membership by Sunspot in his New Avengers and was about to accept it, but Nightmask declined and instead, the two of them started attending college.{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask #1}}

On the first day of college, they were attacked by mind-controlled [[Robert Hunter (Earth-616)|Nitro]], [[Franklin Hall (Earth-616)|Graviton]] and [[Donald Gill (Earth-616)|Blizzard]] twice,{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask #2}} and the second time almost cost Kevin's life, because he was fighting the three of them on his own. Meanwhile, Adam was tracking the source of their control and found out the responsible were the [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]]'s children [[Explosion (Earth-616)|Explosion]], [[Gravitation (Earth-616)|Gravitation]] and [[Entropy (Earth-616)|Entropy]]. After taking away their control over the Earth criminals, he returned to Earth and both he and Kevin attended their first college party.{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask #4}}

The next day, Kevin and Adam met with [[Kolobus (Earth-616)|Kolobus]], after [[Gustav Brandt (Earth-616)|Libra]] brought them together. Then, Kolobus helped them prevent the [[Kree]] [[Va-Sohn (Earth-616)|Starbrand]] from killing Kevin and destroying Earth, although, in the end, it was revealed that there's a fail-safe in the Starbrand power that causes them to become attracted to one another and kiss. Because of this, they call off the fight and Va-Sohn agrees not to attack any more worlds, as Kevin would be there to "make things cosmically awkward". Therefore, Va-sohn and [[Joras-Kyl (Earth-616)|Joras-Kyl]] are returned to their homeworld to reconsider their options.{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask #6}}

After a [[Civil War II|superhuman civil war]], which started due to [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]]' arrival on [[Earth]], and a looming [[Chitauri]] invasion, the idea to build a [[Planetary Defense Shield]] came up.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 10}} After it was built, Kevin was asked by [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Monica Rambeau]] to test it alongside other superheroes.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #14}}

===[[Secret Empire (Event)|Secret Empire]]===
When the Chitauri invasion arrived, heavy-hitter superheroes prepared to hold the line while [[Anthony Stark (Third A.I.) (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and [[Riri Williams (Earth-616)|Ironheart]] fixed the Planetary Defense Shield. Meanwhile, it was revealed the Shield's malfunctions were actually purposefully caused by Captain America, with superficial damage of Hydra's attack covering that up. Rogers activated the Shield.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} leaving Starbrand, Nightmask and the rest of the heroes in Earth's orbit exiled on the other side.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 3}}

The Defense Shield was eventually brought down by the new Quasar [[Avril Kincaid (Earth-616)|Avril Kincaid]], though it resulted in her being temporarily comatose.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 8}}{{r|Mighty Captain Marvel Vol 1 8}} Starbrand later joined the other heroes in ending Hydra's occupation of the United States.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}}

===Death===
One day, Starbrand sensed that the [[Ghost Rider]] [[Roberto Reyes (Earth-616)|Robbie Reyes]] was in [[South Africa]] near an awakened Celestial called the [[Zgreb (Earth-616)|Fallen]]. Fearing that Robbie would endanger the world if he found the Fallen, Starbrand traveled to South Africa and attacked Robbie, planning to destroy him, despite Robbie having no idea what was going on. Robbie fought off Starbrand and eventually awakened his [[Penance Stare]], an ability he didn't know he had before. Subjected to the Penance Stare, Starbrand seemingly perished in an explosion.{{r|Marvel Legacy Vol 1 1}}
