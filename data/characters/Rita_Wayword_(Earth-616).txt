===Early Life===
"Ricochet Rita" Wayword was once a professional stuntwoman. She befriended [[Longshot (Mojoverse)|Longshot]], an interdimensional traveler from the [[Mojoverse]], when he first appeared on [[Earth-616]].{{r|Longshot Vol 1 1}}

===Temporal Paradox===
The story of how Rita became Spiral, however, was a temporal paradox. Rita was attacked by a mutated version of herself called "[[Spiral]]" from the future. This led to her meeting Longshot and falling in love with him. When Longshot sought to return to his home dimension, the [[Mojoverse]], the love-struck Rita went with her boyfriend, only to watch Longshot fail and be captured alongside him by the dimension's evil overlord, [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]]. Longshot was promptly mindwiped to forget all about Rita, while a much worse fate was left for Rita herself.{{r|Longshot #1|6}}{{r|X-Factor Annual #7}}

After holding her prisoner for several years (at which point Rita was made to serve as guardian for Mojo's army of "[[X-Babies (Mojoverse)|X-Babies]]"), Mojo forced his chief scientist, [[Arize (Mojoverse)|Arize]], to perform extreme physical and mental body modifications onto Rita to recreate her into a loyal subordinate. These experiments left her with six arms (some of which are robotic), turned her hair gray, and drove the young woman insane through forcibly evolving Rita's mind to the point that she could see into other dimensions that were used for time travel/teleportation. He also trained her in the dark arts of magic and body modification, so that she could use these skills to mutilate others like Mojo had mutilated her. Finally, in a cruel act of manipulation, Mojo sent Spiral back in time to set into motion the events that led to her former self-becoming Mojo's prisoner and become Spiral by attacking her past self.{{r|Longshot #1}}

===Spiral===
Now trapped in the the past, Spiral found herself stranded on Earth by Mojo for failing to kill Longshot and Rita. At some unknown point, Spiral encountered [[Valerie Cooper (Earth-616)|Val Cooper]] and was recruited into [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]], a revamped version of the second [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Mutants]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #199}} Despite being utterly insane and more blood-thirsty than her new teammates, Spiral quickly became a valuable member of the team, single-handedly defeating the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] on several occasions as well as kidnapping the X-Man [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]] for Mojo. She was also instrumental in Freedom Force's victory over the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]] when sent by the [[United States of America|U.S. government]] to arrest the heroes. Her magical powers temporarily robbed [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] of her energy powers and she also defeated [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], removing two of the most powerful Avengers from the battle.{{r|Avengers Annual #15}}

She also ran the "Body Shoppe", which sells alien cybernetic parts to amputees and others who see the power of cybernetic limbs. [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]] and several members of the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]] were some of her earlier clients though later writers have retconned [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]] and not Spiral as the person responsible for their becoming cyborgs.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #205}} She also was responsible for giving [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] cybernetic eyes, which doubled as cameras for Mojo to spy on the X-Men.{{r|New Mutants Annual #2}}

Along with Mojo, Spiral played a role in [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] becoming Asian.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #256}} Originally, it was believed that the two literally transformed Psylocke from being British to being Asian, but it was discovered that Spiral (without Mojo's involvement) transferred the X-Man's mind into the body of the Asian assassin [[Kwannon (Earth-616)|Kwannon]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #31|32}}

Even though she was a loyal servant of Mojo, Spiral deeply resented Mojo's crass manners and cruelty towards her. In particular, Spiral has been known to go against Mojo's orders and attack Longshot out of the psychotic need for revenge for his seduction on her and how her love for him led to her transformation into the being she is today. As such, Mojo has been known to leave Spiral stranded on Earth (since Spiral required Mojo's power to travel between dimensions safely).{{Citation}}

Spiral was revealed to have conquered an alternate timeline and referred to herself as "The Apocalypse". She managed to kill most of that Earth's heroes, and only [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] and some of his [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]]/[[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] allies were left. Spiral had kidnapped that universe's [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] and tortured him by making him make love to her until his rescue. With the aid of [[Shatterstar]], Spiral was evidently defeated and apparently returned to Mojo's services. She later attacked the X-Men together with Mojo, but ended up defeated once again.{{r|X-Force: Shatterstar #1|4}}

===[[Endangered Species]]/Sisterhood===
Spiral was among the nine criminal geniuses that [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] sought out when it came to reversing the effects of [[Decimation]]. Mojo himself was another.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #200}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 508 Solicit.jpg|thumb|Spiral in The Sisterhood]]
Following [[Messiah Complex]], the X-Men [[Manifest Destiny|relocated]] to [[San Francisco]], and Spiral was approached by the spirit of the psychic [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] clone, [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]]. Using a combination of magic and telepathy, Pryor was able to bring Spiral back to the Mojoverse, in return Spiral had to completely repair the body of Lady Deathstrike who had been critically wounded by [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]]. This particular repair altered Deathstrike's persona slightly - making her more submissive towards Spiral and Pryor - but nevertheless just as deadly.

Being back in the Mojoverse once more, Spiral decided that perhaps it wasn't worth coming back to as Mojo still operated in the tiresome manner which she had come to expect. Possibly manipulated by Pryor all along, she joined her [[Sisterhood of Mutants (Earth-616)|Sisterhood of Mutants]] alongside Deathstrike, the [[Mastermind|Wyngarde]] sisters, [[Regan Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Regan]] and [[Martinique Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Martinique]], and [[Chimera (Earth-TRN220)|Chimera]] to declare war on the X-Men once again.

Part of Pryor's plan involved the further manipulation/mutilation of Psylocke. Betsy had only just returned from an interdimensional voyage of her own and was believed to be dead again by her fellow X-Men. Capturing the disorientated woman, the sisterhood switched her mind back into her exhumed original body via Pryor's magic and Spiral's science and brainwashed her into becoming their newest member. Their plans would eventually failed as Psylocke's own consciousness proved too strong to be overpowered and when the X-Men defeated the sisterhood in combat her mind reverted back to her Asian body.

Spiral used her teleportation to take the remaining sisterhood to safety following Pryor's death, but it is unknown if she has retained any commitment to them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #508|511}}

===Rejected by Mojo===
Spiral kept a low profile for a while, during the [[Utopia (Event)|Exodus]], the [[Second Coming]], the [[Schism (Event)|Schism]] and the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|War between X-Men and Avengers]]. At some point, [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]] got tired of Spiral, displeased by her service, and removed her trans-reality transportation power from her, before dropping her on Earth. There, hopeless, she tried to survive and eventually found a young mutant telepath, [[Ginny (mutant) (Earth-616)|Ginny]], whom she used to make money, in selling her abilities as a pretended drug (the "TAO"), but Ginny managed to save Spiral's life somehow, and their relation became more solid than a simple exploitation.{{Citation}}

Eventually, after the disband of the assassination team [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]], [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] and Psylocke were tasked on a mission to [[Los Angeles]] by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]], rejoining [[Eugene Judd (Earth-616)|Puck]] who was inquiring about a drug dealer selling TAO, a drug that makes people susceptible to a hive mind mentality.{{Citation}}

The three tracked the drug's source to an L.A club, an old bank from the 20s that the drug dealer used to sell drugs and dance, who was revealed to be Spiral, called the Diva of LA Downtown. Psylocke was unable to refrain from attacking her- engaging in open combat and threatening to murder her if the clubbers intervened. Storm and Puck used this distraction to crack open Spiral's vault and were surprised to find a young malnourished girl, Ginny. However, the girl was, in fact, a telepath and the likely source of the TAO drug itself. Confused and frightened, she mentally ordered the clubbers to apprehend Psylocke and save Spiral.{{Citation}}

Ginny and Spiral managed to escaped from the heroes and to rejoin Rita's flat where they were found again. The flat was quickly attacked by a returned from the future [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]], who was looking specifically for the young girl, whom he abducted.{{Citation}}

===Fully Powered===
Under unknown circumstances, Spiral returned to Mojoworld to serve her former master. Along with Mojo and [[Major Domo (Mojoverse)|Major Domo]], Spiral abducted [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] and [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] to force them into performing for Mojo's television programs.{{r|Mr. and Mrs. X #7}} Unbeknownst to Mojo, Spiral had made a deal with Gambit that she would save Rogue if he stole a mystical item for her.{{r|Mr. and Mrs. X #8}}

While communicating with Rogue telepathically, Spiral was attacked by Mojo's guards. Spiral defended Rogue until Gambit arrived with what he believed to be Spiral's baby.{{r|Mr. and Mrs. X #9}} Spiral revealed that the baby was in fact a part of her soul, and that it looked different to anyone who sees it. The soul piece had been removed many years ago by Mojo in order to keep Spiral enslaved. Spiral, with her soul completed, began to leave until she realized that Mojo would easily defeat Gambit and Rogue. Instead, Spiral joined in the battle, and when Rogue absorbed her powers, the trio managed to defeat Mojo. Spiral then teleported Gambit and Rogue back to apartment on Earth.{{r|Mr. and Mrs. X #10}}

| Powers                  = '''Spell Casting''': Spiral has powerful mystical abilities. With gestures or dance moves, she can teleport herself and numerous people across great distances. Teleportation and her more powerful spells require complicated dance moves. Some of Spiral's spell-casting powers can be triggered through small hand gestures of her many hands. Spiral often incorporates knives and swords into more complicated spells. Spiral can also disguise herself through her magic. With Mojo's aid or specific astral events, Spiral can open gateways between dimensions and travel through time. For a time, her trans-reality powers have been cancelled by Mojo, and she can only teleport on [[Earth-616]] where Mojo dumped her. However, Spiral managed to have her interdimensional powers returned to her, through unknown circumstances.
By using magic, Spiral can:
* Teleport herself and others
* Project concussive energies
* Paralyze others 
* Turn invisible 
* Remove superhuman abilities 
* Cause unconsciousness
* Conjure up objects

'''Possession Immunity:''' Spiral's mind seems to be immune from possession. When Rogue attempted to steal Spiral's mind and powers, Spiral collapsed into unconsciousness, but took over Rogue's body instead, laughing that she had danced in many people's souls. This lasted only for a short time, however.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #206}} Nocturne was fooled by Spiral into thinking Spiral had been possessed while Spiral remained in control.{{Citation}}

Spiral is aware, through unknown mystical means, whenever a person speaks her name.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #51}}

She was considered as a [[:Category:Sorcerer Supreme Candidates|possible Sorcerer Supreme]].{{r|New Avengers #53}}[[Category:Sorcerer Supreme Candidates]]

| Abilities               = Spiral is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant and sword fighter. Her six arms are fully coordinated, giving her great dexterity and athletic ability. However, Spiral will often lose to less powerful opponents due to tendencies of overconfidence, toying with her foe for too long, or becoming distracted. To cast many, if not all of her spells, Spiral's arms must be free and unhindered and, in some cases, she must be free to dance as well.{{Citation}}

Spiral demonstrated highly developed skills in cybernetics and genetic manipulation which she has used to turn humans into powerful cyborgs at her Body Shoppe. Most notable include Lady Deathstrike and the cybernetic Reavers, who have since been "upgraded" by Donald Pierce.{{Citation}}
