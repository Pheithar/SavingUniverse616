===Origin===
The Princess of [[Wakanda]], Shuri is the sister of [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]], and an heiress to the throne of Wakanda. She is the youngest child of [[T'Chaka (Earth-616)|T'Chaka]], his only daughter and only biological child with [[Ramonda (Earth-616)| Queen Ramonda]], his third wife. From a very young age, Shuri has wanted to become the first woman to become the Black Panther. Against her mother's wishes, she broke into the arena to challenge her uncle S'yan for the title of Black Panther, but was unable to reach the ring before another fighter defeated S'yan and claimed the title. When the victor was unmasked, it was none other than Shuri's older brother T'Challa.

[[File:Igor Stancheck (Earth-616) from Black Panther Vol 4 6 0001.png|thumb|left|250px|Shuri's first kill]]
===Wakanda Invasion===
When [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Ulysses Klaw]] and his men attacked Wakanda, Shuri defeated [[Igor Stancheck (Earth-616)|Radioactive Man]] using the [[Ebony Blade]].{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 6}}

Shuri had difficulty coping after her first kill, until T'Challa promised he would personally train her in hand-to-hand combat so that she could take his place as Black Panther should a day come when she needed to lead Wakanda. Despite being particularly headstrong, the will to become the Black Panther drove Shuri to become a gifted fighter.

===War with Atlantis===
Shuri, as queen of Wakanda, was involved in treaty negotiations with [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]], who offered to end the bloodshed between their two nations in exchange for refuge in Wakanda whenever he desired. This same treaty was first presented to T'Challa, who originally rejected it. Like her brother, Shuri also declined Namor's offer stating that the conflict between the two nations was no ordinary war, and that the fate of both Wakanda or Atlantis hung in the balance; in the end, one of them would face total destruction. While Namor was celebrating the fabricated peace with T'Challa, T'Challa revealed the truth, and Namor left to find Atlantis a ruin by Shuri's forces after an attack by Wakanda.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 7}} 

===Time Runs Out===
With the [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]] threatening the existence of the universe and the Earth, Namor formed a [[Cabal (Namor's) (Earth-616)|Cabal]] to do what the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] were unable to bring themselves to do, destroy incoming colliding alternate Earths.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 23}} The Cabal took over Wakanda and turned it into their base of operations, razing the [[Birnin Zana (Earth)|Golden City]] and slaughtering its citizens. In an attempt to disrupt the Cabal's stolen arsenal of [[Antimatter Injection System|Antimatter Injection Systems]], Shuri and T'Challa found themselves cornered by [[Proxima Midnight (Earth-616)|Proxima Midnight]] of the Cabal. Shuri remained behind to confront their enemies while T'Challa teleported away, at his sister's request.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 24}}

[[File:Black Panther Vol 5 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|As the Black Panther]]
===Djalia===
Shuri was defeated by the Cabal's forces and trapped within a construct of amber similar to [[Thane (Earth-616)|Thane]]'s, a construct which left her in a state of stasis known as "living death."{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 8}} As Black Panther struggled to find a way to bring his sister's body back to life,{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 1}} Shuri's soul made its way to the [[Djalia]], a transcendent plane that represented Wakanda's collective memory.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 2}}

During her time in the Djalia, Shuri trained with and learned from a griot spirit that had taken the form of Ramonda.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 #3|7}} T'Challa eventually resurrected Shuri by retrieving her soul with the help of [[Eden Fesi (Earth-616)|Manifold]].{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 8}} Now imbued with wisdom and new powers, Shuri confronted [[Aneka (Earth-616)|Aneka]], a [[Dora Milaje (Earth-616)|Dora Milaje]] and one of the leaders of a rebellious  group.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 9}} Shuri seemingly convinced Aneka and [[Ayo (Earth-616)|Ayo]] to stand with the Black Panther in the wake of the invasion of another rebellion led by [[Tetu (Earth-616)|Tetu]], which marched towards the Golden City.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 10}}
