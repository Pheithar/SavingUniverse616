===Origin===
Edward Whelan was raised in a seemingly average and well-off family home. However, his father was secretly abusive of Edward, and this colored his opinion of himself growing up. Edward's self-loathing brought on by the abuse eventually led him to a life on the streets.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #179|183}} At some point, he was picked up off the streets by [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]], the son of a [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi]] scientist, and [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]], the master Nazi geneticist, and subjected to a process that bestowed upon him various ratlike traits and attributes.{{r|Captain America #272}}

===Fighting Captain America===
Able to command rats and other wild beasts, Vermin was dispatched by the pair to stalk and kill their long-time enemy [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. After randomly slashing a cab driver to attract attention, Vermin encountered Captain America in a rundown area of [[Harlem]], and despite unleashing a pack of rats against the Avenger, Vermin was overpowered.{{r|Captain America #272}}

Captain America took him to [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] headquarters for questioning, but Vermin somehow managed to escape shortly afterwards. He then rendezvoused with Zemo and Zola, who took him to Zemo's headquarters in [[Mexico]]. When Zemo had captured Captain America himself, he decided Vermin's usefulness to him was over. He then shackled Vermin next to the Captain in a dungeon and set loose two of his more powerful mutates upon them. Vermin slew one of the mutates and escaped the chamber. He stole aboard Zemo's escape craft, and when Zemo fled from the castle sometime later, Vermin attacked Zemo viciously, wounding him.{{r|Captain America #275|277}}

Returning to [[New York City]], Vermin once again prowled the city streets, finally going on a rampage during the San Gennaro Festival in the [[Little Italy]] section of [[Manhattan]]. He was apprehended by Captain America and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and turned over to local authorities.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #128}}

===Ravencroft Institute===
Vermin was used as a pawn against Spider-Man by [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]] during his "Last Hunt" against the web-slinger.<ref>[[Kraven's Last Hunt]] crossover.</ref> Several months later, Vermin resurfaced and finally confronted his father and his own psychological issues of loathing and worthlessness. He willingly turned himself over to [[Ashley Kafka (Earth-616)|Ashley Kafka]] and the [[Ravencroft Institute|Ravencroft Institute for the Criminally Insane]] for treatment.{{r|{{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man #178}}-{{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man #183|183}}}} Zemo soon returned, but Edward's self-confidence had been developed enough to stand against his former tormentor. He helped Ashley Kafka and Spider-Man protect a group of mutates Zemo and Zola had been abusing.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #194|196}}

Edward was eventually pronounced mentally well and excused of the crimes he committed as Vermin. He returned the favor to Doctor Kafka by taking a position as her aide at the Ravenscroft Institute.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #390}} However, Edward was still occasionally abused by various villains during the outbreaks and riots at Ravencroft, such as when [[Judas Traveller (Earth-616)|Judas Traveller]] triggered the re-emergence of his Vermin persona.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #403}}

===Kraven's First Hunt===
Vermin attacked the new [[Anastasia Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]] for intruding on his tunnels and was beaten by her very severely. He escaped outside and ran into Spider-Man, who was wearing a Daredevil costume. Not recognizing his old foe, Vermin attacked, overwhelming him, and taking a bite out of his shoulder. Up close, Vermin was able to identify Spider-Man's scent. Appealing to the last shred of humanity within Vermin, Spider-Man convinced him to reveal where Kraven was. Vermin later attacked Kraven again but was defeated and captured by her.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #566|567}}

===The Hood's Gang===
Vermin had joined the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]]'s [[Hood's Gang (Earth-616)|criminal army]],{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 35}} which was created to take advantage of the chaos created due to the [[Superhuman Registration Act]].{{r|New Avengers Annual Vol 1 2}} He was active with the group during the [[Secret Invasion]] of the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]], where they worked together with the heroes to defeat the alien army.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 6}} He worked with the team on various missions,{{r|Dark Reign: The Hood Vol 1 1|5}} including facing the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 56|64}} He and the rest of the Hood's crew took part in the [[Siege (Event)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 61}}{{r|Thor Vol 1 608}} He was eventually arrested along with the rest of the gang{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 64}} and imprisoned back in the [[Raft]].{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 4}}

===New Revengers===
After joining the [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]]'s [[New Revengers (Earth-616)|New Revengers]],{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 7}} Vermin and his teammates fought the [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] as they were defending themselves from S.H.I.E.L.D. as part of the Maker's plan to take [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] for himself, but they were ultimately defeated.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 12}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 14|16}}

===Return to the Hood's Gang===
Vermin attended a meeting of various villains organized by the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]] to discuss what to do about [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] who had unexpectedly decided to become a superhero and become the new [[Iron Man]]. As the Hood brought up the idea of forming a gang of villains to take Doom out, Doom suddenly appeared and took down all of the villains present.{{r|Infamous Iron Man Vol 1 7}} He later participated in an ambush against Doom along with many of the other villains that Doom had earlier defeated.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 594}} He also attended a meeting to discuss the Hood's rise as the new Kingpin of crime{{r|Defenders Vol 5 10}} before joining the Hood's Gang once more in ransacking [[Castle Doom]] in search for Doom's fortune.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 597|598}}

===Kraven's Great Hunt===
Back to the sewers, Vermin kidnapped people to serve both as company and food. He was captured by the [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Lizard]] and [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] as a means to get into [[Central Park]], which had sealed off by Kraven the Hunter and turned into the hunting grounds for his Great Hunt between [[Hunterbot]]s and animal-themed criminals.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 19.HU}} After Vermin accidentally revealed that the Lizard and Taskmaster were working together to get into Central Park, Kraven's accomplice [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] injected Vermin with a special drug that made him grow clones out of his body, giving him the company he long longed for.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 20.HU}}

Arcade later set the [[Vermin (Earth-616)|Vermin]] loose on Spider-Man,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 21}} almost killing him until Kraven dispersed them with a sonic weapon.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 21}} Following the end of the Great Hunt, the Vermin escaped to the subway.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 23}}

===Moon Knight===
Whelan's dupes would turn up some time later in New York; seeking to snatch up people from various apartment flats who were under the protection of [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]]. After a brief confrontation with the low town protector, Marc would let Vermin's caste off's go on the condition he/they never come anywhere near his stomping grounds again. Lest he render the all to one before leaving them well and truly dead.{{r|Moon Knight Vol 9 1}}

| Powers                  = Vermin was granted superhuman abilities like those of a rat through genetic engineering at the hands of Arnim Zola. His powers are proportional to those of a human-sized rat.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #23}}

'''Superhuman Strength:''' Vermin possesses physical strength that is slightly beyond the natural physical capability of any normal human and can lift approximately 1,000 lbs.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #23}}

'''Peak Human Speed:''' Vermin can run and move faster than even the fastest Olympic level sprinter. While not superhuman, he can run as fast as it is naturally possible for a human being to run and can reach a top speed of 35 miles per hour.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #23}}

'''Peak Human Stamina:''' Vermin's musculature produces somewhat less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of most ordinary humans. He can physically exert himself at peak capacity for about 30 minutes before fatigue begins to impair him.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #23}}

'''Superhuman Durability:''' Vermin's body is somewhat harder, tougher, and more resistant to injury than the body of an ordinary human. While far from invulnerable, Vermin can endure impact forces and trauma that would severely injure or kill a normal human being with mild to moderate discomfort.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #23}}

'''Superhuman Agility:''' Vermin's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are heightened to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits and capabilities of even the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #23}}

'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Vermin's reflexes are similarly enhanced and are superior to those of the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #23}}

'''Superhumanly Acute Senses:''' Some of Vermin's physical senses are substantially superior to those of ordinary human beings. Vermin can see perfectly in near-total darkness and his sense of smell is also as acute as that of a rat. He is capable of detecting the approach of other living things from well over 100 feet away, even if he cannot hear or see them.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #23}}

'''Rat Communication:''' Vermin can communicate with and command rats and stray dogs within a radius of two miles from him. On several occasions, he has commanded hundreds of sewer rats to attack an enemy. How he commands these creatures is unknown, although it is more likely hypersonic than telepathic in nature.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 14}}

'''Razor Sharp Teeth & Claws:''' Vermin possesses very sharp and strong teeth as well as 1-inch claws at the tip of each of his fingers. His teeth and nails are strong enough to gnaw through wood, fibers, and even soft metals (like lead) within minutes.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 14}}

'''Demi-Cellular Division:''' After being administered an odd pharmaceutical by Arcade, Edward gained the ability to biophysically duplicate himself through rapid cellular mitosis.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 20.HU}} Able to create a seemingly endless number of duplicates of himself all able to work in conjunction with each other rather seamlessly.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 21}}

| Abilities               = While he has had no formal training, Vermin's powers coupled with his savagery have made him a formidable combatant. Vermin is capable of great savagery, and when provoked or threatened, has phenomenal resistance to pain and fatigue.
