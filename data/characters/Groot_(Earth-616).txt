| History                 = ===Early Life===
Groot was a [[Flora colossi]] from [[Planet X]], the capital of the branch worlds. He did not get along with his fellow saplings, instead preferring the company of the "Maintenance Mammals" who the other saplings treated with prejudice. After Groot killed another sapling to defend a maintenance mammal it was brutalising, as well as releasing [[Hannah (Earth-616)|a human subject]] that was kidnapped for scientific purposes, he was exiled from the planet by the "Arbor Masters."{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 14}}{{r|Groot #6}} With no place to go, Groot set to explore other galaxies.{{r|Groot #6}}

===[[Annihilation: Conquest]]===
Into his adulthood, Groot found himself in Kree space, where he was promptly captured and imprisoned. While in jail, he formed a rapport with [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]] and was assigned to a covert ops team led by [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Starlord]], whose goal was to assault [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]] and defeat the [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]]. His body was mostly destroyed, but a small twig of him split off, preserving him, traveling in the care of Rocket Raccoon, fitting easily in his hand or riding on his shoulder. Groot had fully regrown himself soon after their mission was complete.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord Vol 1 1|4}} Groot then continued to help Starlord and the others he had teamed up with to fight the Phalanx, once again sacrificing himself to save the others and regrowing from a twig.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 2|6}}

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
Groot joined Star-Lord's Guardians of the Galaxy, alongside many of those he had fought against the Phalanx alongside, including Rocket, though he did not at first fight alongside the team he was still regrowing himself.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 1}}

===Mojo TV===
Groot and Rocket Raccoon were having a libation in a low-down dirty spacer bar in low-down dirty spacer space when they were accosted by a group of [[Badoon]] who attempted to arrest them for 'Crimes against the Royal Brotherhood'. A quick shootout ensued and Rocket created an avenue of escape by shooting holes in the beer barrels causing the saloon patrons to stampede for the free beer. The duo made a hasty exit and were soon rocketing away when they found themselves pursued by Badoon Attack Cruisers. Rocket ordered Groot to take evasive action while he went to boost the stardrive to allow them to escape. He found the stardrive compartment empty and the scene cut to a shot of the surprised Rocket with a cliffhanger closing credits and [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]] proclaiming "Best Pilot Episode Ever!"{{r|Annihilators: Earthfall #1}}

[[File:Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616) from Annihilators Vol 1 4 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]

They then found themselves staring at an empty compartment where a stardrive should be and questioning why they were hearing voices like suddenly their lives just got a narrator. Their ship blew up and they appeared in space in combat space armor bewildered at what just happened and how they got there. They targeted their Badoon attackers forcing one of the pilots to eject. They squeezed into his craft and it began to plummet to an ice planet below. Mojo called for the scene to cut and hit the Bio-Stasis on his stars. He proceeded to plan for the next scene expecting to make enormous money on the show. In the background, Rocket's Timely Inc. Shipment Processing Device analyzed the situation and informed the duo they were caught up in an artificial dramatic construction. They blasted through a wall realizing they were in a "Flarkin' TV Studio" and were confronted by a hologram of Mojo who opened fire with real weapons.{{r|Annihilators: Earthfall #2}}

Groot and Rocket Raccoon were transported to the [[Mojoverse]] by the inter-dimensional TV producer known as Mojo. He had decided to use the pair in his latest reality television show. He recruited various criminals that the heroes had fought in the past. He placed the pair in scenarios where they would have to battle them again, however, if an innocent life form was caught in the crossfire, they would be killed in the process.{{r|Annihilators: Earthfall #3}} As the duo moved from one scenario to another, Mojo began advertising action figures with a collection pack that allowed buyers to assemble their own 12" Groot figure after collecting all five. The demand was so high, Mojo stood to make a fortune until the Timely Inc. Shipment Processing and Analysis Device decided to take control of the situation and held a B-00-M Meson Beam Gun to Mojo's face. It allowed the reality system to stop just long enough for the heroes to escape. They confronted and destroyed Mojo who was revealed to be a robot controlled by [[Major Domo (Mojoverse)|Major Domo]].{{r|Annihilators: Earthfall #4}}

===Return of the Guardians===
Groot, along with the rest of his team, aided the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] in fighting the returned [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]].{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 6}}Thanos managed to get a [[Cosmic Cube]] from the United States Army, with which he escaped to Moord, the homeland of the [[Badoon]]. The Guardians arrived at the [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] and informed the Avengers about the situation. They joined the Guardians to fight Thanos and the Badoon.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 7}}

[[File:Groot (Earth-616) from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 4 0001.jpg|thumb|right]]

After Thanos apparently killed the [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elders of the Universe]], to impose his supremacy, he became one with the Cosmic Cube and killed the Avengers as well as the Guardians. But actually, they were sent to the [[Earth-10011|Cancerverse]] along the Elders, there, Tony Stark found that Thanos' weapon wasn't actually a Cosmic Cube and that it had defects. They bargained with the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]], in exchange of a weapon capable of deactivating the "Cube" and return to Earth, the Avengers and the Guardians would let Thanos to be defeated by the Elders. With the help of other members of the Avengers, Thanos was defeated and sent to punishment by the Elders.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 8}}

===Black Vortex===
Soon after joining the Guardians on behalf of the Avengers as a liaison, [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]] started losing control of [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|his symbiote]]. After it was taken from him by the Guardians as a precaution, the symbiote escaped confinement and bonded with Groot for a brief time.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 21}}

Together with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Groot was one of the many heroes involved in the hunt for the [[Black Vortex]], an ancient power-bestowing artifact. After being captured by [[J'son (Earth-616)|Mister Knife]], Groot and [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] members [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] and [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] came across the Black Vortex while escaping from the villain's mobile fortress. Groot submitted to the power of the Black Vortex and tapped into a cosmic level of powers.{{r|Cyclops Vol 3 12}} When he rejected the powers imbued by the Black Vortex once it had been secured, Groot's appearance was slightly altered. Instead of being composed entirely by barky wood, his body became formed by vines topped by protective slabs of wood.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: Black Vortex Omega #1}}

===Shattered===
While accompanying Rocket to the [[Stohlad Ring]], Groot was attacked by the [[Elders of the Universe|Elder of the Universe]] known as the [[Ord Zyonz (Earth-616)|Gardener]]. Claiming that Groot had been corrupted by the Guardians and deviated from his destructive purpose, the Gardener shattered Groot. Rocket managed to escape with a splinter of Groot which he subsequently planted so he could regrow his body.{{r|All-New Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 9}} However, the Gardener used Groot's remains for the same purpose, planting a garden of twisted maniac Flora colossus whose growth prevented the original Groot from growing bigger than a sapling.{{r|All-New Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 1|2}}

[[File:I Am Groot Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Small-Sized Groot]]

The Guardians of the Galaxy eventually caught notice of the Gardener's use of the army of Flora colossus, and faced them on the planet [[Telferina]]. During the battle, Groot managed to get close to the Gardener, and used his healing powers to purify the Elders' body of the poison that drove him mad. In return, the Elder used his abilities to restore Groot's body, not only returning him to his normal size, but also restoring his locution, allowing him to speak full sentences, albeit in third person.{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 1}}

===Dark Olympians===
When the Guardians of the Galaxy were approached by [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] for their assistance in stopping the conquering rampage of the [[Olympians]], who had been reborn as bloodthirsty rogue gods, Groot was one of the Guardians who refused out of concern for the safety of each other.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 1}} Some of the members, including Star-Lord, snuck away to assist Nova and were successful in their mission of trapping the Dark Olympians in an alternate dimension at the apparent cost of Quill's life.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 2}} As a result, Gamora broke off the team with the other Guardians who had stayed behind, including Groot, and formed their [[West Spiral Arm Guardians (Earth-616)|own team]] of Guardians of the Galaxy to return to their mercenary ways.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 3}} During their first mission, which consisted on the assassination of Rocket Raccoon, Groot tipped his friend off about the attempt on his life and even stopped the hitman, Rocket's rival [[Blackjack O'Hare (Earth-616)|Blackjack O'Hare]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 5}} In the aftermath of the mission, both teams reached a truce, but Groot even defected back to the original team.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 6}}

Star-Lord returned from the other-dimensional world of [[Morinus]], where he had spent a hundred of years of his life, albeit unaging, to herald the escape of the Dark Olympians from their imprisonment.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 9}} The two Guardians teams came together for the final confrontation against the Dark Olympians which saw their defeat. During the battle, Groot was charred to a crip by a lightning bolt from [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 11}} Rocket had new member [[Otherone (Earth-616)|Prince of Power]] use his abilities derived from the [[Power Stone]] in his possession to grow Groot back to life, although in the process he again evolved beyond language, limiting his vocabulary once again to "I am Groot." Following the defeat of the Dark Olympians, the Guardians of the Galaxy were sanctioned by the [[Galactic Council (Earth-616)|Galactic Council]] as protectors of the cosmos in light of the increasing uncertainty of the galactic landscape, providing them with headquarters in the space station [[Proscenium]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 12}}

| Powers                  = '''Flora Colossus Physiology:''' Groot is the member of an alien race of humanoid trees and as such, possesses various abilities unique to his species.
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Groot has been seemingly killed on three occasions, each time regrowing from a sprig. This may be a major contributor to his botanopathy.
* '''Size Addition:''' Groot can grow at an extremely advanced speed at will, growing to his normal size from a sprig,{{r|Rocket Raccoon Vol 2 2}} or growing from his normal size to a giant form.
* '''Plasticity:''' Groot has the ability to stretch his limbs for long distances and reshape them for a variety of tasks. He normally takes the shape of a large tree-like humanoid, but can also weave his limbs into a dense tangle of vines. He can grow individual limbs to currently undisclosed lengths, allowing him to have stretching powers, similar to [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]].{{r|Groot #2}} This may be related to his cellular regeneration and his control over plants.
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' Groot's tree like form provides him great strength. His strength allows him to overpower [[Antonio Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Armadillo]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 16}}
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' Groot's hide is composed of wood dense enough and durable enough to make him immune to most conventional weapons, including gunfire and fire which would consume most woods.
* '''Chlorokinesis:''' Groot especially has the power to control other plants, or his own physical form, therefore he can turn his hands into blades, or grow in size altogether, or even use that power to heal himself from fatal wounds.
* '''Healing Power:''' Groot is able to heal others. While the full capabilities are unknown, Groot was able to rid the Gardener of poison within a few seconds.{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 1}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Powers
| body  = '''Black Vortex Empowerment:''' After exposure to the power of the [[Black Vortex]] groot was both physically and internally transformed; his cosmic potential exponentially expanded upon his natural capabilities.{{r|Cyclops Vol 3 12}}
* '''Self-Sustenance:''' Groot can survive in the vacuum of space unaided.{{r|Cyclops Vol 3 12}}
* '''Flight:''' able to fly at various speeds under his own volition at will.{{r|Cyclops Vol 3 12}}
* '''Augmented Botanic Mass:''' Groot's bodily form has been enlarged and enhanced with cosmological energies, strengthening his already impressive condition greatly.{{r|Cyclops Vol 3 12}}
* '''Bio-Organic Thermokinetic Furnace:''' Groot seemed to pulsate with what was a wellspring of natural biophysical energy.{{r|Cyclops Vol 3 12}}

| Abilities               = '''Genius-Level Intellect:''' Groot has received the finest education from Photonic Knowledge of the Arbor Masters. He was highly intelligent and has a tremendous grasp of quasi-dimensional super-positional engineering. Again, allegedly, as reported by a man openly known as "Maximus the Mad".{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 17}}
| Strength                = 
| Weaknesses              = '''Language Barrier:''' To most people, Groot appears to only say "I am Groot." This made communication with most people all but completely futile. [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus the Mad]] asserted that whenever Groot was saying his trademark "I am Groot!" he had actually been saying any number of things. It was the hardened nature of Groot's larynx that causes people, who are oblivious to the subtle nuances of his speech, to misinterpret him as merely repeating his name.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 17}} After spending some time with Groot, certain people such as [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]] were able to pick up his nuances, and understand him.{{r|Groot #2}}

However, the Planet X of Fantastic Four fame has since been destroyed, while Groot recently returned home.
