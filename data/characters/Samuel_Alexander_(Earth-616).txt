===Origins===
While searching for his missing father, [[Jesse Alexander (Earth-616)|Jesse Alexander]], Sam fell off his skateboard and hit his head. When he woke he discovered [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]] and [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]] standing over his hospital bed. They too were searching for Jesse and his [[Nova Helmet (Supernovas)|Black Nova helmet]].{{r|Nova Vol 5 1}} After discovering Jesse's helmet, Gamora and Rocket Raccoon began to teach Sam how to use a Nova helmet. While training with Gamora and Rocket Raccoon, Sam flew to the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]].{{r|Nova Vol 5 2}} There, he had an encounter with [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu The Watcher]] who showed him an incoming [[Chitauri]] armada that was headed towards [[Earth]].{{r|Nova Vol 5 3}}

Sam was trained by both Gamora and Rocket Raccoon how to properly use his helmet in order to one day live up to his father's legacy. He was eventually able to beat them both and was deemed worthy to apprehend the Watcher's task. They sent Sam as a scout to gather information on the invading force. Right when he found the Chitauri, somewhere near [[Jupiter (Planet)|Jupiter]], they fired, leaving Sam "unconscious."{{r|Nova Vol 5 4}} When the Chitauri went to extract Sam into their ship, he revealed to them he was faking and quickly sped off. He went through one of the enemy ships and found the [[Ultimate Nullifier (Weapon)|Ultimate Nullifier]]. He took it and then attempted to run through the mothership, disabling all soldiers. He was thwarted by [[Titus (Earth-616)|Titus]], a former Nova and ally of his father. Despite what Sam's father had told him, Jesse left the Supernovas when they needed him most and many of them lost their lives because of him. Titus was shot in the eye and arm and then made a trade with Chitauri, his life for all the Nova's secrets and weapons. Sam was infuriated and radiated a light so powerful that it stunned Titus and many Chitauri and escaped to Earth.

[[File:Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) from Nova Vol 5 5 0001.png|thumb|left|Sam Alexander wielding the Ultimate Nullifier]]
Titus followed him there and was eventually stopped the Ultimate Nullifier. Sam had developed a friendship with Uatu and revealed to him that he is the only person he feels comfortable talking to. When Sam returned home he expresses his doubt of his fathers supposed death. Whom is being held captive by the Chitauri on another planet.{{r|Nova Vol 5 5}}

===[[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers vs. X-Men]]===
At some point before the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers' war against the X-Men]], Sam came to the planet [[Birj]], trying to warn its people of the coming of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]]. Instead, he battled [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax]], who refused to leave his planet.{{r|Point One Vol 1 1}} He managed to escape the destruction caused by the Phoenix, and fled to Earth, to warn of the coming of the Phoenix Force.{{r|Point One Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) and Avengers (Earth-616) from Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Sam's arrival]]
Sam eventually arrived on Earth, though he accidentally crashed into a plane. Stunned, he crash-landed on the ground and was discovered by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], although [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] mistook him for [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|a different Nova]].  Injured, all Sam could tell the Avengers was that "it" was coming, before falling into a coma. Unknown to him, a small portion of the Phoenix Force's energy was left on his uniform, which [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] analyzed and managed to confirm that the cosmic force was heading towards Earth.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men: Infinite Vol 1 1}}

After he recovered from the landing, Nova joined the Avengers and the X-Men in the final battle against the [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Dark Phoenix]], who commented on his possible alien heritage.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 #12}} Although he too couldn't help to defeat the Phoenix, his bravery led to him being offered a place in the Avengers by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]. On his way back home, Sam was ambushed by [[Archibald Dyker (Earth-616)|Diamondhead]], who bore a grudge against Sam's predecessor Richard Rider and, by association, anyone in the Nova Corps. Though Diamondhead was easily able to shrug off Sam's attacks due to him lacking the power and experience that Rider had, Sam was ultimately able to fend off his aggressor by blinding him with a flash of light and leaving him stranded on a high plateau in the desert.{{Citation}}

===Post-AvX===
[[File:Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) recalling his life from Nova Vol 5 6.png|thumb|200 px|left|Sam Alexander reminiscing on his recent past as the Nova.]]
Nova asked his [[Eva Alexander (Earth-616)|Mom]] if he could be an Avenger to which she initially replied "no." After a small speech by her, she finally decides not to stand in his way and that if he wanted to still fight crime, she wouldn't stop him. In his everyday school life, Sam was also having some trouble settling into regular life. When he found himself in a confrontation with school bully [[Karl Moffet (Earth-616)|Karl]], he forgot how normal he really was. In one instance, Karl threw a punch at Sam. Sam leaned back, dodging it, but fell on his back forgetting he couldn't fly. He found it even more difficult to keep his secret identity from his crush, [[Carrie (Nova) (Earth-616)|Carrie]].{{r|Nova Vol 5 6}}

The same night that his mom talked to him about being Nova, he decided to go out for some fun by looking for villains in New York. While there, he met up with [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man then gave him some advice about crime fighting. Following this advise, he went back to the skate park that he destroyed and tried to be a hero for the people who were burdened with the job of cleaning it all up.{{r|Nova Vol 5 7}}

===[[Infinity (Event)|Infinity]]===
[[File:Sam Alexander (Earth-616) from Nova Vol 5 8 001.jpg|thumb|150 px|right|Sam Alexander accidentally removing his helmet mid-flight.]]
After the skate park was rebuilt Sam encountered his crush, Carrie. Sam was caught off-guard when she told him that she knew that he was Nova. He then flew away in such a rush that he made a stupid mistake of accidentally removing his helmet mid-flight and fell straight out of the sky. When he awoke from the minor coma he had suffered, he found [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warrior]] members [[Vance Astro (Earth-616)|Justice]] and [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Speedball]] trying to persuade him into joining their team. He initially refused, however, after learning that they were good friends of Richard Rider, he agreed to see what it was like.{{r|Nova Vol 5 8}}

His first "mission" as a member, didn't go so well. He faced a threat like no other, who threatened everything he loved. [[Kaldera (Earth-616)|Kaldera]], slave of [[Proxima Midnight (Earth-616)|Proxima Midnight]], was sent to Earth to kill Sam because of his title as Nova. She offered Sam the choice of Brakk-Tar, meaning a battle without using any powers nor weapons. He agreed and went by her rules, until she called his mom a "cow". After insulting her and calling her a bully, he decided to not fight fair and used his powers to fight her. In a desperate plan to escape, Kaldera teleported herself back into [[Thanos' Ship]] and Nova followed. He won and Kaldera was sent off far away from Earth while Sam was reunited with his family and team members.{{r|Nova Vol 5 9}}

===New Warriors===
[[File:Samuel Alexander (Earth-616), Victor von Doom (Earth-616), Avengers (Earth-616), and T'Challa (Earth-616) from Nova Vol 5 10 001.jpg|thumb|250 px|left|Sam exaggerating the events of his time in New York.]]
In the wake of the Kaldera incident, Sam's arrogance grew, making up exaggerated stories of how he was granted the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]]'s [[Silver Surfer's Surfboard|surfboard]] and then high-handedly defeated [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] after he wiped out all the Avengers and X-Men with [[Mjolnir]], Thor's hammer, to impress his mother and prove her restrictions on his dual life were completely unnecessary. He also brushed off the newly reformed New Warriors as a bunch of nobodies who were beneath someone of his talents. After that, his mom let both Justice and Speedball rest at his house until they could decide who else to recruit into their team, making him very annoyed. He became even more aggravated when his crush, Carrie, came over to confirm her suspicions about Sam being Nova. He was going to tell her she was correct until she cut him off and made it seem like Sam didn't trust her. Carrie then ran away from Sam and he felt like everybody was suddenly changing. Sam was so angry that he flew to the moon to find Uatu, the only person who he felt comfortable talking to. After venting his frustrations and demanding any form of guidance, the Watcher showed him visions of his predecessor Richard Rider and how he grew from an upstart hero like Sam, to a founding member of the original New Warriors, and to the hero of the [[Annihilation (Event)|Annihilation War]]. Uatu also showed him how the Avengers neglected Richard Rider and the New Warriors needed him. Sam being put on the spot by Uatu realized his wrongs and went back to his mother and agreed to all her conditions and officially joined the New Warriors as a reserve member.{{r|Nova Vol 5 10}}

===Finding the Missing Nova Corps===
[[File:Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) from Nova Vol 5 10 002.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Sam Alexander becoming blind]]
Sam was later seen responding to a distress call, he rescued a starship from hostile forces and escorted them back to their homeworld. Meanwhile, Sam's mom and principal were talking about Sam's tendency to not show up to school. The principal also told her that the house won't be getting anymore money from her husband because he hadn't been showing up to school either. While flying home Sam experienced some problems. He quickly sped up and began to become blind until he crashed into Earth.{{r|Nova Vol 5 10}} Sam was then escorted to [[Character Index/K#Kettlewell|Doctor Kettlewell]]'s office by his mother. Dr. Kettlewell assured Sam he wasn't blind, but was having optical migraines due to the amount of hits he had taken to his head. Sam then returned to school, only to get into another fight with Karl and wind up in the principal's office again. He was let off with a warning and returned to his next class when he started to experience his "blindness" again. He realized it was a map of some sort and shouted with joy, unaware of where he was at the moment. His teacher sent him to see Principal Philbin again. He realized detention wasn't working for Sam and instead made him join the chess team. Sam joined and sat through a "boring" lesson on pawns by [[Mrs. Schaefer (Earth-616)|Mrs. Schaefer]] and then left home in a hurry. The first chance he got, Sam flew off to find out what the map was for.{{r|Nova Vol 5 11}}

[[File:Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) from Nova Vol 5 11 001.jpg|thumb|350 px|left|Sam Alexander viewing his map of lost Novas.]]
After tracking down one of the coordinates, Sam encountered the corpse of [[K'thol (Earth-616)|K'thol]], a former gold dome. He was quickly attacked by alien spiders and was able to fend them off until he grabbed K'thol's Nova helmet. A message was sent to Sam about his cause of death and how these very spiders killed K'thol for no reason. Infuriated, Sam struck all the spiders down and continued on his journey to locate all other Novas and uncover the truth of the missing corps. Unknown to Sam, by playing K'thol's message, Nova bounty hunter, [[Cadivan (Earth-616)|Cadivan]], found him on his radar and started planning to attack him and add another helmet to his collection.{{r|Nova Vol 5 11}} After tracking down one of Cad's Nova Helmets, Nova went face to face with man responsible for killing countless Novas. After being deemed unworthy of battling, Cadivan sent Sam away from his ship and within seconds Nova was tasked with intercepting a distress call.{{r|Nova Vol 5 12}}

===Captain Skaarn===
[[File:Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) from Nova Vol 5 12 001.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Sam finding the Novamobile.]]
After following the distress signal to its origin, Sam found a huge Nova ship that was being attacked by unknown ships. After disarming the ships, Sam boarded the spacecraft and was surprised to find no Novas. Instead, he found [[Captain Skaarn (Earth-616)|Captain Skaarn]] who was thankful for Nova coming and rescuing him and claimed to be in his debt so stood there to answer any questions he may had. Captain Skaarn also told Sam how his "battery" was fried and needed a jump-start to start moving again and then took Sam to see what the problem was. Sam was startled when he found another dead Nova, as the battery. The Nova was attacked by a microscopic infection and although his mind was dead, his body lived on. Captain Skaarn's [[Tinkerer (Earth-616)|Tinkerer]] was able to send an electrical impulse throughout the Nova's body, thus powering the ship, however, as his flesh decayed so did his ability to power the ship.{{r|Nova Vol 5 12}}

[[File:Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) from Nova Vol 5 12 002.jpg|thumb|200 px|left|Nova powering the Novamobile.]]
Nova originally rejected the suggestion that he powered the ship, but after being swayed by Skaarn's "daughter", [[Jinin (Earth-616)|Jinin]], he agreed to do it and was successful. After Sam left, Skaarn then gave Jinin her food for pretending to be his daughter, but tricked her by throwing her in his slave pit where they all attacked her for her food. Afterwards, [[Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616)|Beta Ray Bill]] was revealed to have been on board [[Gron (Earth-616)|Gron]]'s ship and Captain Skaarn and his crew were evil and because Nova helped them and defeated the good guys, Beta Ray Bill swore to end Sam.{{r|Nova Vol 5 12}}

After tracking Sam down to his school, Beta Ray Bill broke up a fight between him and Karl. Freaked out, Karl ran away and hit his head on a light pole. Taking his frightfulness as him knowing he did something wrong, Beta Ray Bill assumed he was the Black Nova whom saved Skaarn. While Beta Ray Bill was distracted Sam was able to put on his helmet and attacked Beta Ray Bill.{{r|Nova Vol 5 13.NOW}}

[[File:Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) and Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616) from Nova Vol 5 13.NOW 001.jpg|thumb|right|Sam fighting Beta Ray Bill]]
During their fight Sam realized Captain Skaarn was evil and swore to Beta Ray Bill he didn't know this and demanded he joined him to stop Captain Skaarn. Sam, however, had to babysit Kaelynn while his mother had her first day of work. So he got Carrie to do it for him while him and Beta Ray Bill went looking for Captain Skaarn.{{r|Nova Vol 5 13.NOW}}

When asked by Sam where he was headed, Skaarn had previously said "nowhere", according to the young Nova who thought that the captain was not being forthcoming in his answer. Beta Ray Bill, though, realized that Skaarn was actually on his way to [[Knowhere]], the scientific observatory built inside the severed head of a [[Celestials (Race)|Celestial]] at the end of the universe. Instructing Sam to stay put outside, Beta Ray Bill went inside looking for Skaarn. While bargaining for a giant War Bringer, Skaarn was confronted by Beta Ray Bill after shooting the War Bringer's owner. Threatening to kill his prisoners, the [[Korbinites]], Beta Ray Bill agreed to withdraw. Outside, Sam battled and defeated a War Bringer after which he and Beta Ray Bill took Skaarn to his ship. Skaarn teleported Beta Ray Bill to another realm. Sam, however, managed to stay behind, by projecting an image of himself, tricking Skaarn into believing that he also was sent away. While trying to figure out a way to bring his ally back, Sam heard a voice inside his head that lead him to an injured [[Cosmo (Dog) (Earth-616)|Cosmo]], the psychic dog that is in charge of security for Knowhere.{{r|Nova Vol 5 14}}

[[File:Skaarn (Earth-616), Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616), and Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) from Nova Vol 5 15 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|They were too late.]]
After rushing the poisoned Cosmo to the infirmary, Sam managed to save him using the Nova Force. Sam then hurried to confront Captain Skaarn, who just thirty seconds earlier left Knowhere leaving behind three rogue [[Spaceknights]], known as the "Disavowed of Galadoria". Planning to rob a secret weapons vault, the knights were to teleport directly into the vault using the Continuum Cortex while Skaarn launched an assault head-on. Sam fights the knights and teleported them to the Cortex' last used coordinates where Beta Ray Bill is. With Skaarn's assault on the vault still 8 hours away, Sam uses the Continuum Cortex to get back to Arizona, and his school, to avoid getting suspended. Back on Knowhere, Sam reunites with Beta Ray Bill and teleported to the vault, but realizing that they're too late, as Captain Skaarn somehow has managed to take over the vault.{{r|Nova Vol 5 15}} While Beta Ray Bill tried rescuing the Korbinites, Sam took Skaarn on alone. After threatening Sam's world, Sam became enraged and gave Skaarn everything he had. He imagined Skaarn was Moffet and attacked him until he believed he was dead. He took his sword and threw it into a dying star, thinking it would simply destroy it. After Beta Ray Bill heard this he quickly searched for it and recovered it before it fell into the wrong hands again. Sam then took the almost dead captain to Cadivan who in return gave him his helmet. Jinin who expected Sam to make money off the bounty hunter was very upset with Sam for doing that. She smacked him and claimed that he made a new enemy. Sam then went to the site where it all happened and made a tribute to the dead Nova who powered Captain Skaarn's ship.{{r|Nova Vol 5 16}}

===Back Home===
[[File:Samuel_Alexander_(Earth-616)_from_Nova_Vol_5_17_001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Kaelynn with the Nova Helmet.]]
Glad it was all over, Sam returned home only to be devastated with the news that his family would lose their home.{{r|Nova Vol 5 16}} Sam tried to help his mom out with money in any way possible. He crafted a boulder made of a solid gold for her to sell, but his plan backfired when the boulder began emitting radioactive energy and ruining her crops. After constantly trying to help his mom, he agreed to watch Kaelynn while she worked. In his sleep, Kaelynn picked up his Nova Helmet and put it on. After making a large sound and breaking the wall, Sam calmed her down and took the helmet back. He was able to convince her that the wall was broken already and she hurried off to bed.

After his mom's return, they had a huge fight and Sam flies away in anger. His mom tried to warn him that the neighborhood watch was trying to catch him, but was too late to catch Sam before he left. Sam saved an oil rig from a bad fire and saved an old man and woman from imminent death before returning home. Sam and his mom exchanged secrets of the eviction notice on the house and that the neighborhood watch is after Sam and eventually made up. Sam told his mom that he knew that Jesse was alive and that next time he saw the Watcher that he will find out where he is.{{r|Nova Vol 5 17}}

===High Evolutionary===
[[File:Evolutionaries, Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616), and Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) from New Warriors Vol 5 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|High Evolutionary attacking Nova]]
While the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] was capturing heroes from all over, he encountered Sam. He rendered Sam unconscious and was very pleased that he was able to catch a Nova.{{r|New Warriors Vol 5 1}} When Sam woke up, the Evolutionary conversed with him and declared that a human Nova was his only chance at saving humanity. The Evolutionary had originally thought that humanity should artificially evolve and strove towards that end, but had been recently convinced that that wasn't the case: apparently the Celestials had their own plan for humanity's evolution and would eradicate all life should they judged it had gone astray in any way. To avoid that, he had reconfigured his first machine to eliminate all "impure" humans that were "threatening humanity's future" with their mere existence. Sam's helmet's [[Xandarian Worldmind (Earth-616)|Worldmind]] was needed to focus the machine on all super-powered life on Earth so they could be given the mercy of a quick and painless death.{{r|New Warriors Vol 5 2}}

Sam and the High Evolutionary's conversation was cut short when they were interrupted by his [[Evolutionaries]]. They came with [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]], [[María Aracely Penalba (Earth-616)|Hummingbird]], and [[Faira Sar Namora (Earth-616)|Water Snake]], all unconscious.

[[File:Kaine Parker (Earth-616), Samuel Alexander (Earth-616), and Evolutionaries from New Warriors Vol 5 3 001.jpg|thumb|right|"I am the help."]] After mistaking Scarlet Spider for Spider-Man several times, Kaine was able to talk to the spiders in the High Evolutionary's base and get them free. Barely given a second to plan a strategy, the Evolutionaries attacked and Sam was asked to go off for help and warn the world. Letting his ego get the better of him, Sam ditched his quest and came back claiming to be all the help they needed.{{r|New Warriors Vol 5 3}} After being overrun with Evolutionaries, Justice and Speedball came, with new heroes [[Selah Burke (Earth-616)|Sun Girl]] and [[Mark Sim (Earth-616)|Mark]]. They quickly gained the upper hand, but lost it just as fast when the High Evolutionary rendered Sam unconscious. Sam being the only one who knew how his machine worked made them useless for when he activated it. Everyone on the team was quickly dying, except for Sun Girl, the only one without natural powers. She blasted the High Evolutionary and his machine, saving the day and prompting the High Evolutionary and his remaining Evolutionaries to retreat. Afterwards, everyone else was offered a place on the team and Sam went back home.{{r|New Warriors Vol 5 4}}

After the fight against the High Evolutionary, the New Warriors went up against many other foes such as demons, The Avengers and [[Lash (Earth-616)|Lash]]'s [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] [[Tribe (Earth-616)|Tribe]].{{r|New Warriors Vol 5 #6|8}} For all of these missions Sam was absent due to personal problems and was only able to show up at the end when everything was solved. Sam went to their home base where he saw that Speedball had left him a message saying he sucked.{{r|New Warriors Vol 5 8}} Following that, the team got out to Prague to relax at a nightclub bar while Justice was trying to convince Scarlet Spider to remain in the team. They were denied entrance because of Sam's clear underage appearance until [[María Aracely Penalba (Earth-616)|Hummingbird]] enthusiastically "mindblasted" the bar's bouncer with her mysterious Aztec demigod powers.{{r|New Warriors Vol 5 9}}

[[File:Aracely Penalba (Earth-616) and Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) from New Warriors Vol 5 11.png|thumb|left|125px|Speedball's assessment of Nova and Hummingbird]]
As the High Evolutionary set to once more annihilate the super-powered population of Earth, the New Warriors attacked his flying base ship by surprise. With great coordination, they were able to stop him, but not without losing [[Mr. Whiskers (Earth-616)|one of their own]] in the process. But just as they were wrapping things up, the [[Eternals (Race)|Eternals]] arrived.{{r|New Warriors Vol 5 10}} Their leader [[Zuras (Earth-616)|Zuras]] instructed the other Eternals into helping the High Evolutionary. Sam and the rest of the New Warriors were paralyzed, watching aghast as Scarlet Spider was mercilessly beaten until Speedball courageously lead them to counter-attack. Sam battled one of the Eternals inside and outside the ship and managed to thoroughly and impressively defeat her. Nevertheless, by the time he returned to the ship, the rest of the New Warriors were lying on the ground and he was quickly overpowered by all the other enemies. The team was put in a new version of the High Evolutionary's machine to feed their individual energy and genetic signatures to it.{{r|New Warriors Vol 5 11}}

[[File:Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616) and Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) from New Warriors Vol 5 11.png|thumb|right|200px]]
As the machine activated and its energy wave swiped Earth to kill all super-powered off-shoots of humanity, Hummingbird revealed that there was actually no Celestials coming up to judge Earth: during the fight she had seen in Zuras' mind that he had lied to everyone about the Celestial's intentions. But restrained as they were, the team was unable to act on this information while Zuras managed to silence them or deflect any suspicion of his persona from his peers.{{r|New Warriors Vol 5 12}}

[[File:Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) and New Warriors (Earth-616) and Eternals (Earth-616) from New Warriors Vol 5 12.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Sam telling everyone what's going on]]
However, Justice, who had been dealt with separately from the rest of the team, returned to the fight and freed his teammates, damaging the High Evolutionary's machine in the process. Justice then convinced the rest of the Eternals and the High Evolutionary that Zuras had indeed been lying. The leader of the Eternals was forced to admit the Celestials weren't coming, albeit blaming the attempted genocide entirely on the High Evolutionary with the excuse "he had been tricked by him too" and conveniently silencing his unwitting pawn with an energy blast before the High Evolutionary could defend himself from this accusation. Amid lingering suspicion, the Eternals left, warned by the New Warriors not to come back. Sam is then seen happily walking away with the rest of his teammates from the crashed ship, throwing his helmet to the air in celebration of their victory.{{r|New Warriors Vol 5 12}}

===Original Sin===
After stopping [[Tomazooma (Robot) (Earth-616)|Tomazooma]], the Avengers praise Sam for his efforts and Sam asks them about Uatu. After being told about Uatu's actions, Sam decides to visit him and ask the questions has in mind. He then rushes to Uatu on the moon who shows Sam why he only watches, and then tells Sam that his father is alive.{{r|Original Sin Vol 1 0}}

[[File:Samuel Alexander (Earth-616) from Original Sin Vol 1 0 001.jpg|thumb|200 px|left|Sam finding out his dad is alive]]
Sam flies home where he and his family pay respects at the tribute Sam made towards all the deceased Novas. After this he goes to visit Uatu to gain further knowledge of his dad's whereabouts. He finds the Watcher dead and took off, passing by some Avengers on the way. When he finally lands in New York he sees all the superheroes fighting [[Oubliette Midas (Earth-616)|Exterminatrix]], and hundreds of [[Mindless Ones]]. Right when it was Sam's time to shine and stop her he froze and all the other superheroes got a crack of her before he could even move a muscle. While standing there in self pity, [[Orb (Mercenary) (Earth-616)|The Orb]] released one of the Watcher's eyes and watched as every superhero was told on powerful sin relating to them. For Sam, he saw two Novas fighting and then one of them summon a silhouette of another Nova who killed the other one. This shaded Nova was revealed to be Sam's father, Jesse Alexander. Jesse was approached by [[Adomox (Earth-616)|Adomox]], who congratulated him on his work. Sam was distraught and realized he couldn't wear his Nova Helmet anymore.{{r|Nova Vol 5 18}} After wallowing in self pity for a while, Sam decided it was better if he flew away to find answers. He met up with Rocket Raccoon and together went to visit Adomox for the truth. Adomox set off the alarm and released a poison into the air that only he had the cure for. Meanwhile, Adomox told Sam stories of the Supernovas to stall him and let the poison make its way into them. He told him that the Supernovas were formed on the belief that the Nova Corps wasn't strong enough. The Supernovas stole the Nova Corps' power for their own selfish desires. After stalling for long enough he revealed to them the poison he let out. He told them that if they wanted to live that they would reprogram an old helmet so he can get his powers back.{{r|Nova Vol 5 19}} Sam made his way to the station where Adomox told him he could reconfigure a Nova helmet. In the same place Sam found all Nova service records, including the one that proved his dad's innocence. Sam also packed the Nova helmet with some weapons that when someone other than Sam put it on they would get electrocuted. After Adomox laid on the floor in pain, Sam demanded the location of the antidote for the poison. After he refused to give it up, Sam's old friend Cosmo came in and read Adomox's mind for the serum. After curing him Sam saw his dad's current status on a planet called Chitauri Prime where he was a gladiator and fought in a coliseum for the Chitauri's amusement.{{r|Nova Vol 5 20}}

===AXIS===
Sam was among the heroes present during the battle against [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Onslaught]] after he used his powers to spread hate across the world.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 1}} Days later, [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America]] called a meeting in the Avengers Tower and gathered all the heroes who were or had been Avengers. Informing the guests about the Red Skull's disappearance, Captain America told them that only somebody with Avengers clearance would be able to free him and everyone in the room was a suspect. Spider-Man's spider-sense triggered, and he quickly escaped [[Stark Tower]] through the window, yelling at Sam to fly them to safety, but they were attacked by [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Queen Medusa]] and Captain America. Spider-Man and Nova managed to escape with the help of [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]. He then took Spider-Man and Nova to the [[Avengers Mansion]], where Steve Rogers informed them about the effects of the inversion, including Kluh's rampage across [[Arizona (State)|Arizona]]. Without thinking, Sam took off to confront him.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 5}}

Sam arrived in [[Carefree]] and engaged in combat against Kluh. Kluh attempted to bite off Sam's arm before being blasted up the nose. Irritated, Kluh hit Nova so hard he crossed the Atlantic and crashed head-first into the [[Eiffel Tower]] and continued his rampage.{{r|Nova Vol 5 23}}

===Post-AXIS===
After learning that Sam's mother works at a local diner, [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]] took her hostage there in order to get his attention, but, tired of waiting, he decided to kill her. Sam arrived before he could do so and took him away from the diner to an empty area in order not to hurt anyone. While fighting, Nova tried to convince him that he wasn't Sam Alexander, but the maniac didn't believe him. After being wounded by the Nova Force, Carnage fled in order to heal as the police arrived. In the next day, already healed from his burns, Carnage attacked Sam again, this time at his school.{{r|Nova Vol 5 26}}

While attacking Sam at school, Carnage saw another person as Nova flying around the area, thus making it impossible for the boy to be Nova (unbeknownst to him, that was Sam's younger sister wearing his helmet while carrying their mother). Enraged, Carnage followed the false Nova, but lost sight of her. He then started to attack innocent people to try and get Nova's attention, which he got. A new battle ensued between them both. Carnage was taken by Nova to the sky and then punched him into the parking lot below, the impact setting off the cars' alarms, dizzying Cletus and the symbiote. Realizing Carnage's weakness to high sounds, Sam threw Carnage into an Anthrax show nearby, a heavy metal band which Cletus was a fan of. As the symbiote screamed in pain, Cletus fled from there to the road, but was attacked by Nova again. He threw a car at Sam, who caught it midair, and took advantage of it to punch him. Ready to finish off his opponent, Carnage was hit by a truck. He was then tied in metal plates by Sam and left by his symbiote as he revealed he wanted to kill Nova because he wanted to erase any memory of his good deeds, from the time he had his moral axis inverted, from anyone who remembered it. He was left by Sam in Ryker's Island.{{r|Nova Vol 5 27}}

===[[Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: Black Vortex|Black Vortex]]===
On an adventure with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], the group discovered an ancient artifact known as the [[Black Vortex]], which enhanced the abilities of the user. After the destruction of [[Hala (Earth-616)|Hala]], and in an attempt to keep it from [[Thane (Earth-616)|Thane]], [[J'son (Earth-616)|Mister Knife]], and the [[Slaughter Lords (Earth-616)|Slaughter Lords]], Nova took the Black Vortex back to his apartment on Earth. However, his sister tried to take the Black Vortex. After this, and after the [[Collector]] showed up at his doorstep, Nova decided the Black Vortex wasn't safe on Earth. He took it to [[Spartax (Planet)|Spartax]] to look for the Guardians and the X-Men, but was captured by Thane and had the Black Vortex taken from him.{{r|Nova Vol 5 28}} 

===Joining the Champions===
For a brief time, Nova became a member of the Avengers alongside other two teenager superheroes, [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Spider-Man]] and [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]].{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 3}} Sam's relationship with Ms. Marvel was particularly rocky at the start, since when they first teamed-up, Sam backpedaled rudely on revealing his identity to her.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 1}} In a short time, the three young heroes became close friends.{{r|Nova Vol 6 3}}{{r|Spider-Man Vol 2 8}} Following the [[Civil War II|second superhuman civil war]], Nova, Spider-Man and Ms. Marvel quit the Avengers, feeling that the team wasn't living up to their standards. They founded the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]], a group of proactive teenage heroes that wished to foster a better tomorrow through hope and wisdom.{{r|Champions Vol 2 1}}

When the recently-reinstated Nova Corps confronted the Chitauri warlord [[Warbringer (Earth-616)|Warbringer]] to protect the [[Power Stone]] in [[Xitaung]],{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 1}} they sent a distress call to all Novas. Sam received the message, and the Champions convinced him to let them join him in answering the call. The young heroes intercepted Warbringer in [[Chitauri Prime]], where he attempted to carry out a genocide against the members of his own race loyal to the throne usurper, [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]]. The Champions decided to prevent the mass-murder of the Chitauri despite the fact they were evil,{{r|Infinity Countdown: Champions Vol 1 1}} and managed to defeat Warbringer. Unfortunately, when the Champions handed over Warbringer to the Nova Corps, Nova's helmet was confiscated by [[Scott Adsit (Earth-616)|Commander Scott Adsit]].{{r|Infinity Countdown: Champions Vol 1 2}}

===Master of Weirdworld===
Nova sunk into a depressive state following the loss his helmet. He remained with the Champions and tagged along in their adventures despite his inability to jump into action.{{r|Champions Vol 2 22}} While on a mission in [[Tanzania]], the Champions encountered the [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-11234)|Man-Thing]], and during the confrontation, Sam and the [[Nadia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] were dragged through the [[Nexus of All Realities]] into [[Weirdworld (Battleworld)|Weirdworld]].{{r|Champions Vol 2 23}} They landed amnesiac and transmuted by the land's magic, with Sam gaining the ability to channel the power of rare energy crystals. The two young heroes were tracked down by the [[Eshu (Earth-616)|Master of the World]], a villain of the Champions who was keeping track of the team's activities and investigated Sam and Nadia's disappearance.{{r|Champions Vol 2 26}} The Master of the World took them under his wing, employing Sam's power to explore Weirdworld in a journey of conquest, and becoming a father figure to him. Sam became the Master's loyal apprentice, Nova Knight.{{r|Champions Vol 2 26}}

When the rest of the Champions arrived at Weirdworld, they intercepted the Master of the World's attack on a crystal deposit that he intended to use to force his will on the land. During the battle, [[Riri Williams (Earth-616)|Ironheart]] convinced Sam to renounce his powers and identity as Nova Knight, returning to his normal self. Following the Master of the World's escape, the Champions were returned home by the Man-Thing.{{r|Champions Vol 2 27}}

===The Return of Nova===
By the time the Champions expanded into a worldwide initiative, Amadeus had taught Sam to pilot the [[Champions Mobile Bunker]] to be of use for the team, but he remained disgruntled by the loss of his powers.{{r|Champions Vol 3 1}} When [[Kaldera (Earth-616)|Kaldera]] returned to Earth to have a rematch against Sam and found him powerless, she offered to help Sam retrieve it from the Nova Corps.{{r|Champions Vol 3 4}} The duo infiltrated the [[Spirit of Xandar]], but discovered Sam's helmet had been returned to Earth during the [[Thieves Guild (Earth-616)|Thieves Guild]] mass heist on the superhuman community,{{r|Champions Vol 3 7}} and it was since then in storage at a military base in [[Iowa (State)|Iowa]].

When Sam and Kaldera arrived at the base, it happened to have become the scene of a confrontation between the Champions and the [[Freelancers (Earth-616)|Freelancers]]. While Kaldera unwittingly joined forces with the Champions to take down the Freelancers, Sam snuck into the base and retrieved his helmet. With his powers as Nova returned, Sam confronted Kaldera, but decided to cut their fight short by trapping her in a force field, expressing that securing her was more important than either her honor or his pride since she was a murderer. The Nova Corps arrived shortly afterwards, and detained her. Adsit attempted to lay claim to Sam's helmet again, but Sam stood his ground, forcing Adsit to leave with his hands empty.{{r|Champions Vol 3 8}}

| Personality             = Sam was a disbeliever, thinking his dad's stories of being an [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|intergalactic policeman]] were nothing but nonsense and subsequently viewing his dad as a loser. Despite this, he still cared for his father. Sam, being only 15 years old, is still a child and acts immaturely in some situations. He also is very arrogant due to his powerful abilities.{{Citation}}

| Powers                  = Sam has shown the ability to see the map of dead Novas even without his helmet, though it is unknown if he has any direct connection to the Nova Force.{{r|Nova Vol 5 11}}

| Strength                = Currently 30 tons.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 672}} His power grid indicates that he can lift into the 75-100 ton range,{{r|Avengers NOW! Vol 1 1}} probably accounting for an ability to harness more of the Nova Force than he currently does.
| Weaknesses              = His powers are dependent of his Helmet.{{Citation}}
* Since his battle with [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)#Incarnations|Kluh]], he suffers memory disorders.{{r|Nova Vol 5 24}}

| Equipment               = * [[Avengers Identicard|Avengers ID Card]], granting him a Full Security Clearance.{{r|Nova Vol 5 25}} It's unknown if he still has the ID Card in his possession following his departure from the Avengers.{{r|Champions Vol 2 1}}
