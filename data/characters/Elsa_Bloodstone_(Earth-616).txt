===Early Life===
'''Elsa Bloodstone''' is the daughter of [[Elise Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elise]]  and the immortal monster hunter, [[Ulysses Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Ulysses Bloodstone]]. Born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts (State)|Massachusetts]], she was actually raised in [[England]] and saw [[Europe]] as home.{{r|Bloodstone Vol 1 1}}{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 9}}

Ulysses was a strict parent, to say the least; as a rite of passage, Bloodstone had his daughter fight the [[Blight Beast (Earth-616)|Blight Beast]] when she was only a baby.{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 8}} He also tried to remove her weakness as a child by throwing her to a horde of [[Great White Sharks]] off the coast of [[South Africa]].{{r|Astonishing Tales: Boom Boom and Elsa Vol 1 1}} For her first kill, her father made her fight a Qlippoth, but she took 10 seconds too long and got its blood all over her head. Elise wanted to shave Elsa's head to remove it, but Ulysses had ordered Elsa to let it remain there and infect her scalp as a sign of her inadequacy, so Elsa complied with her father. Elise, on thee other hand, wasn't very happy with it, and Ulysses decided it was best to remove her from the equation, which he accomplished by putting her in contact with some Monster Fiends and then claiming she was insane and had to be taken to a medical institution.{{r|Marvel Zombies Vol 2 3|4}}

[[File:Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616) from Bloodstone Vol 1 1 001.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Getting the Bloodstone Choker]]
When Ulysses' age was finally catching up with him, he begged Elsa to end his life, but she refused.{{r|Marvel Zombies Vol 2 3}} After he died, she settled in his former [[Bloodstone Curios|family estate]], in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts (State)|Massachusetts]] and decided to start a Monster Hunting career as well, using the powers of [[Bloodgem|Bloodstone]] Choker whenever the situation demanded.{{r|Marvel Zombies Vol 2 3|4}}{{r|{{cl|Bloodstone Vol 1 1}}-[[Bloodstone Vol 1 4|4]]}}{{r|Thunderbolts Annual Vol 2 1}}

===Nextwave & The Initiative===
At some point, Elsa Bloodstone joined [[Nextwave (Earth-63163)|Nextwave]] in their fight against The [[Beyond Corporation (Multiverse)|Beyond Corporation]].{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 1}}

After her exploits with Nextwave, Elsa registered to the [[United States Government (Earth-616)|US government]] by joining the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]],{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #1|; 2009 edition; Bloodstone, Elsa's entry}} and returned to her monster-hunting ways. She hunted down the Children of Goram to [[Prague]] where she was impregnated by one of the monsters, but the Bloodgem killed the offspring while it was inside her and she puked it up. She killed all the monsters and vowed to kill all monsters before she died (also vowing to be the last of the Bloodstone line, never to have a child).{{r|Marvel Assistant-Sized Spectacular Vol 1 2}}

===Braddock Academy & The Covenant===
[[File:Cullen Bloodstone (Earth-616) from Avengers Arena Vol 1 5 001.jpg|220px|thumb|right]]
In between her monster hunting, Elsa became a staff member of the [[Braddock Academy (Earth-616)|Braddock Academy]].{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 5}}

When a being known as the [[Dreaming Maiden (Earth-616)|Dreaming Maiden]] started dreaming again, Elsa was drawn to track her down, due to her father being a member of the [[Covenant (Earth-616)|Covenant]], a group that tried to kill the [[Dreaming Maiden (Earth-616)|Dreaming Maiden]] years ago but did not succeed in doing so, due to deception by the assassin they hired, [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]. This led her to search out the Maiden to finish her father's work which brought her into contact with Wolverine in the present day. It also brought her into direct confrontation with Covenant members [[Murderous Lion (Earth-616)|Murderous Lion]], [[Jefferson Chambers (Earth-616)|Jefferson Chambers]], [[Wyatt Crowley (Earth-616)|Wyatt Crowley]], and [[Menace (Covenant) (Earth-616)|Menace]]. After the Maiden had been killed, Vanessa Baker, another previous member of the Covenant, brought her and the other members together to "get back to business".{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 314|317}}

===Meeting Deadpool===
Shortly after her time with the [[Defenders (Valkyrior) (Earth-616)|Defenders]],{{r|Fearless Defenders Vol 1 8|12}} [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] and [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]] broke into Bloodstone Manor to steal Elsa's Bloodstone Choker. She caught them in the act and managed to lock both in a dungeon with the help of [[N'Kantu (Earth-616)|Living Mummy]] and [[Frankenstein's Monster (Earth-616)|Frankenstein's Monster]], but they managed to escape and take the Bloodstone with them.{{r|Thunderbolts Annual Vol 2 1}}

Furious the "White Stripes" had just robbed her, she tracked them down to get her belongings back, but ended up helping them defeat a [[Oberoth'm'gozz (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange impersonator]] instead. In the end, her Bloodstone was returned to her, but [[Wizardry Alchemy Necromancy Department (Earth-616)|W.A.N.D.]] director [[Pandora Peters (Earth-616)|Pandora Peters]] thought it was best for everyone involved to forget the incident and made Elsa and the Thunderbolts remember the events of that day as a nice Shawarma lunch together.{{r|Thunderbolts Annual Vol 2 1}}

===AXIS===
In the wake of the [[World War Hate]], Doctor Doom's personality was inverted, along with that of numerous heroes and villains. After having seen the errors of his ways, Doom planned to redeem himself.{{citation}}

After the Avengers disappeared, having being captured by the inverted and evil Avengers Unity Division, Doom tasked Valeria Richards with the mission to assemble a group of certainly available heroes, including Elsa, each having specific skills that could be utilized.{{citation}}

The new Avengers assembled in Doctor Doom's Castle and jumped into action when the now-evil Scarlet Witch arrived to Latveria to have revenge on Doom.{{citation}}

The Avengers fought the Scarlet Witch and saved villagers trapped in the crossfire. 3-D Man managed to get hold of the Witch and take her to a machine Doctor Doom had created to specifically canalize her abilities. Soon after being put into the machine, the Scarlet Witch escaped and set out to find Doom, leaving the Avengers behind. After condensing a portion of Scarlet Witch's powers into the device, Valeria informed the heroes their job was done.{{r|Avengers World #16}}

===Battleworld===
After the collapse of the [[Multiverse]], Elsa found herself on [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]], believing to have lived there her entire life and now being a commander of the [[Hel-Rangers (Earth-15513)|Hel-Rangers]] who guarded the [[Shield (Battleworld)|Shield]]. During an attack on the Shield by a Zombie horde, Elsa was teleported deep into the [[Deadlands (Battleworld)|Deadlands]] by [[Deadlands (Battleworld)/Residents#Azazel (Earth-13264)|Azazel]]. There, she found [[Elsa Bloodstone (Shuttup) (Earth-15513)|a small girl]] with no idea who she was or how she'd gotten there. Naming the girl 'Shuttup' and saving her from a zombified [[Deadlands (Battleworld)/Residents#Cain Marko (Earth-13264|Juggernaut]], the pair decided to travel together, unknowingly being followed by [[Ulysses Bloodstone (Earth-13264)|a mysterious figure]].{{r|Marvel Zombies Vol 2 1}}
[[File:Elsa Bloodstone (Shuttup) (Earth-15513) and Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616) from Marvel Zombies Vol 2 1 001.jpg.jpg|180px|thumb|left|With "Shuttup" on Battleworld]]

After numerous attacks by Zombies, the pair eventually made it to the southern tip of Battleworld, where they were confronted by the unknown figure, who was revealed to be an alternate version of Ulysses Bloodstone. Ulysses was trying to obtain all versions of the Bloodstone and all members of the Bloodstone family were inexplicably drawn to this location due to this desire. After Ulysses bit off Elsa's forearm and seized Shuttup, Elsa finally realized the little girl was a personification of her lost childhood and everything Ulysses had deprived her of. While sharing this realization, she got Ulysses distracted, allowing Shuttup to seize her gun and kill him. She then absorbed the bloodstones he'd captured and merged with Shuttup, while restoring her hand. Using the power now within her grasp, she destroyed the zombie horde and restored Ulysses back to life fully healed in hopes of giving him a second chance.{{r|Marvel Zombies Vol 2 3|4}}

===Multiverse Restored===
When the Multiverse was restored, Elsa resumed her regular activities. After an encounter with [[A-Force (Earth-616)|A-Force]], during which she bonded with [[Nico Minoru (Earth-616)|Nico Minoru]] over both having severed limbs,{{r|A-Force Vol 2 8}} she traveled to [[Peru]], where she found a prophecy about a monster apocalypse and a ruler among monsters.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 2 1}}

She tracked down a kid named [[Kei Kawade (Earth-616)|Kei Kawade]], who had the power to summon monsters and communicate with them. Kei was initially afraid of using his powers and testing his limits, but, being the only hope against a global invasion from the [[Leviathon Tide (Earth-616)|Leviathon Tide]], he used his abilities to summon all the monsters he was familiar with. Then, with some encouragement from [[Lunella Lafayette (Earth-616)|Moong Girl]], he created his own monsters and, together, they defeated [[Leviathon Mother (Earth-616)|Leviathon Mother]] and stopped the invasion.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 2 2|5}}

Once the dust settled, Kei was given an entire island the Inhumans created for him, which served as his and his parent's home, as well as a refuge for his monsters. Elsa Bloodstone was also asked to guide him and protect him.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 2 5}}{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 3 1}}

Eventually, Kei grew confident and proficient in his abilities and Elsa thought it was time to let him grow on his own. As they were saying goodbye, she told him, she'd be there for him if he ever needed it.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 3 10}}

===Monster Island===
Some time later, during a monster hunt in [[Prague]], Elsa came across a [[Bone Beasts (Race)|Bone Beast]]. She fought the creature using her Bloodstone hand, but it got infected by the beast, causing Elsa to slowly begin dying.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 7}}
[[File:Wade Wilson (Earth-616) and Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616) from Deadpool Vol 8 1 0001.jpg|200px|thumb|right]]

Later, [[Blaylock (Earth-616)|Blaylock]] contacted Elsa to kill the newly appointed [[Monster King (Earth-616)|Monster King]] of [[Staten Island]] and force all the monsters out of there, but she declined the job, forcing him to hire Deadpool instead. Despite her initial refusal, Elsa eventually reconsidered the offer and tried to murder the king, but Deadpool was already on scene and actually managed to kill the creature, thus becoming the new monarch, in accordance with an old Monster Law.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 1|2}}

When King Deadpool was then attacked by [[Last Son of Kraven (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]], Elsa, seeing him being overwhelmed by the hunter, shot Deadpool with a bullet that temporarily transported him to the Bone Beasts' pocket dimension, thus making Kraven flee the scene and allowing Deadpool and the other Monsters to come up with a strategy.{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Vol 8 2}}-[[Deadpool Vol 8 4|4]]}}{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 7}}

After Kraven's defeat, Elsa confessed to Deadpool that she believed he could make a good King and, after some initial resistance on Wade's side, Elsa even began assisting Deadpool during his reign.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 4|6}}

[[File:Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616) from Deadpool Vol 8 6 001.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Bloodstone hand infected]]
After she informed Deadpool that she was infected, the duo went to [[Greenland]], where she told Deadpool about the Bone Beasts. They battled some of the creatures invading a village, but discovered the Bone Beasts had already taken the children. They then entered a portal in the sky and arrived at the Bone Beasts' dimension, where the [[Bone Beast Queen (Earth-616)|Bone Beast Queen]] awaited intending to make Deadpool her new host.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 7}}

Despite feeling betrayed by Elsa, Deadpool fought to escape and save the children, but when she collapsed due to her infection, he removed the bloodstone from her hand and placed it on himself. He fought the Queen while Elsa took the children through the portal back home and, once they were all safe, he blew himself up. Worried about Wade, Elsa came back to find his detached head on the floor next to her infection-free bloodstone. After taking it back, she shot a powerful beam from her hand and defeated the Queen, who was still alive, once and for all. After this, Elsa took Deadpool's head to look after him while he regenerated.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 8|9}}

| Powers                  = According to Elsa, she had some of the [[Bloodgem]] power via a genetic inheritance from her father, and it was present in her blood, indicating that she didn't gain powers solely via the [[Bloodgem|Bloodstone]] Choker, but was born with at least some of her power already. An example of this is her immunity to [[vampire]] bites.{{r|Bloodstone Vol 1 4}} The stone grants her superhuman strength, agility and enhanced regenerative powers.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 2}} 

The bloodstone can also discharge potent energy blasts when called upon and, despite not being capable of controlling it initially,{{r|Bloodstone Vol 1 2}} she has made it work on command since she got her bloodstone hand. The concussion streams she releases are powerful enough to blow away giant monsters at will.{{r|{{cl|A-Force Vol 2 8}}-[[A-Force Vol 2 9|9]]}}{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 8|9}}

| Notes                   = * It has been noted by readers, and even by characters in-universe, that Elsa' flashbacks and statements greatly contradict the characters' pasts - in the case of both Elsa and Monica. In ''[[Bloodstone Vol 1|Bloodstone]]'', it was established that Elsa had no prior training and had neither seen her father since she was a toddler, nor had she any memories of him at all.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 3 6}}{{r|Astonishing Tales: Boom Boom and Elsa Vol 1 1}}
** In ''[[Nextwave Vol 1|Nextwave]]'', considering the comedy aspect, these alterations were seemingly off-the-cuff, and done for effect.
** This issue was addressed in "Super Boys!" ({{cl|Astonishing Tales: Boom Boom and Elsa Vol 1 1}}; in which [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom-Boom]] asks ''"Wait... Since when did you know your dad as a kid?"'', to which Elsa answers ''"Who are you, [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu the Watcher]]?"'', dismissing the question.
* Revelations about Elsa's past and other family members made in {{cl|Avengers Arena Vol 1}} and {{cl|Marvel Zombies Vol 2}} also contradict her family history as it was originally established. In {{cl|Bloodstone Vol 1 1}}, which supposedly took place "several years" after Ulysses Bloodstone died, Elsa was eighteen years old, hadn't seen her father since her parents split when she was two, and Elise Bloodstone was pregnant with a child whose father was (obviously) not Ulysses. Although the Elsa who appeared on Battleworld could well have been a counterpart and not the Earth-616 version, there has been no attempt made to reconcile how Cullen Bloodstone exists on Earth-616.
* The "Primer" page in each issue of ''[[Nextwave Vol 1|Nextwave]]'' states that Elsa's powers of strength and invulnerability were bestowed upon her by the [[Bloodgem]] she wears on a choker, although she does not appear to be wearing it in {{cl|Nextwave Vol 1 8|issue #8}}'s flashbacks to her childhood training sessions.
