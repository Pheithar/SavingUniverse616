| Overview                = The '''Swordbearers of Krakoa''' were chosen by [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Omniversal Majestrix Opal Luna Saturnyne]] to stand against the [[Swordbearers of Arakko (Earth-616)|Swordbearers of Arakko]].

| HistoryText             = When the forces of [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]], led by the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|First Horsemen of Apocalypse]], entered [[Otherworld]] they ravaged [[Dryador]]. Using the [[External Gate]], [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] led a group of [[Homo superior|mutants]] to Otherworld where they were almost immediately ambushed by First Horsemen of Apocalypse and [[Summoner (Arakko) (Earth-616)|Summoner]]. To end the fighting, [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Omniversal Majestrix Opal Luna Saturnyne]] offered the Horsemen and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] the opportunity to enter a [[X of Swords|tournament of champions]]. With no alternatives, both sides accepted the offer and Saturnyne magically implanted the tournament weapons and champions into the minds of [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] and [[Pestilence (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|Pestilence]].{{r|X of Swords: Creation Vol 1 1}}

With only three days prepare for battle, the chosen swordbearers set out to gather their swords. [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] had to travel to [[Hell]] and enlist the aid of [[Solem (Earth-616)|Solem]] to obtain the [[Muramasa Blade]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 6}}{{r|X-Force Vol 6 13}} [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] travelled to [[Wakanda]], where she stole the [[Skybreaker (Sword)|Skybreaker]] after being told she would not be able to use it.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 13}} Already armed with their swords, [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] used her [[Soulsword]] to train [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]] and [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 13}} [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] was also called back to Krakoa from [[Peak VII|The Peak]] with [[Light of Galador|The Light of Galador]].{{r|Cable Vol 4 5}} Knowing of the prophecy, [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Brian Braddock]] unearthed the [[Sword of Might]] from its burial spot beneath the [[Braddock Lighthouse]], and after deceiving Saturyne, [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Betsy Braddock]] obtain the [[Starlight Sword]]. Together, Betsy as Captain Britain and Brian as Captain Avalon join the other swordbearers armed with the Starlight Sword and Sword of Might respectively.
