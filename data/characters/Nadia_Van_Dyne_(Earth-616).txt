===Early Life===
'''Nadia''' was the daughter of [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]] and his first wife, [[Maria Trovaya (Earth-616)|Maria Trovaya]], who was kidnapped during their honeymoon and subsequently killed by foreign agents, Nadia was raised in the [[Red Room Academy (Moscow)|Red Room]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], where she was being trained to become a Red Room agent herself.

[[File:Black Widow Ops Program (Earth-616) from All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 9 001.jpg|left|thumb]]
Her earliest memory is of a [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|man with a star on his arm]]. When Nadia started to read, she showed great aptitude for science, so her handlers, believing her skills to be genetic, informed her of her famous heritage and began encouraging her to emphasize her studies more. Learning of her parentage only increased Nadia's drive to escape the Red Room, and she was eventually able to obtain a black market [[Pym Particles|Pym Particle]] sample.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 9}} Nadia had a young friend named [[Ying Liu (Earth-616)|Ying]], who helped her in her study of Pym Particles and learned a way to use them; however, she disappeared suddenly and Nadia was told she was reassigned to another project. Nadia attempted to impress her superiors into bringing her back, but they never did.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 14}} After studying the Pym Particles enough to master their size-changing properties, Nadia used them escape the Red Room.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 9}}

===Becoming the All-New, All-Different Wasp===
After her escape, Nadia immediately made her way to the front door of [[Hank Pym's Laboratory|Hank Pym's home]] in [[Cresskill]], [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]], where she discovered that Hank had seemingly sacrificed his life to stop [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]] shortly beforehand. Crushed that her father passed before she could even meet him, Nadia decided to shrink down and break into his lab in order to learn as much about him as she could. Using old [[Ant-Man's Suit|Ant-Man suit pieces]] and materials laying around, she crafted [[Wasp's Suit|a new costume]] and decided to become the new [[Wasp]], vowing to earn the admiration of her father's allies.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2016 Civil War II}}

Nadia decided that she wanted to meet her stepmother, [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Janet Van Dyne]], the original Wasp, and the team that her family helped found, the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], and thus went to introduce herself to the current iteration of the team. Arriving at the [[Stark Industries New Jersey Airfield|Avengers Hangar]], Nadia was at first mistaken to be the one responsible for firing energy blasts at their headquarters. After Nadia introduced herself to the team, the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], still suffering from the after-effects of [[Nathaniel Richards (Mister Gryphon) (Earth-6311)|Mr. Gryphon]]'s control, started to pop in and out of the [[Glossary:Timestream|timestream]]. The energy blasts that were attacking the Avengers earlier were time-displaced from the moment he tried to hit Nadia when she arrived at their headquarters.

As the Avengers tried to figure out a way to help their friend, the Vision's solar powers started to go superthermal, transforming him into a living bomb that would destroy the entire hangar and everyone inside it. Ignoring [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]'s order to retreat, Nadia flew inside the Vision to plant explosives, which she detonated, causing his temperatures to normalize and seemingly saving his life. Having earned their trust, Nadia was taken by [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Edwin Jarvis]] on a road trip in which he would introduce her to her extended family tree.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 9}}

Jarvis and Nadia next went to [[Long Island]] and meet Janet in [[Southampton (New York)|Southampton]], though they had to rush due to the threat of a [[Microverse]] bomb. Together, Nadia and Janet defused the weapon, saving [[Barack Obama II (Earth-616)|the President of the United States]]. Realizing how out of touch Nadia was with the real world, Janet took her out for a day out before admitting that, while she'd fight to the death to keep the name, she was fine with sharing it as long as Nadia used it for good.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 12}}

Returning to [[Van Dyne Estate|Janet's home]], the two Wasps had to deal with [[World Headquarters for International Scientific/Philosophical Experimentation and Research (Earth-616)|W.H.I.S.P.E.R.]] agents disguised as members of the Russian Consulate; however, news of [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]]'s death at the hands of [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] was soon revealed, devastating Nadia. She decided to try to stop the impending [[Civil War II|Civil War]] by using her Microverse-based lab to construct a device so that [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses]] could focus his powers; however, the device went critical and Janet, having raced in to stop her, was forced to pull her out. Devastated further, Janet had to tell Nadia that not everything can be fixed by applying science and this was something that had to be fixed through personal means, despite the fact that it felt like she was losing her friends. While Nadia slept, Janet admitted to Jarvis that her innocence and drive was a refreshing thing and that she was proud to have her as a Wasp.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 14}}

===Establishing G.I.R.L.===
[[File:Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 6 Textless.jpg|left|240px|thumb]]
In the aftermath of the second superhuman Civil War, Nadia joined the Avengers and [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] accompanied her to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services in an effort to help sort her naturalization issues. After the meeting with [[Deborah Forrester (Earth-616)|Deborah Forrester]], the pair assisted [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]] in taking down [[Monica Rappaccini (Earth-616)|Monica Rappaccini]], and although the Scientist Supreme escaped, Nadia gleefully spent time with Bobbi, whose work on [[Project Gladiator (Earth-616)|Project: Gladiator]] and adventures in the [[Savage Land]] had inspired her as a child. After mentioning that [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s list of most intelligent [[Homo sapiens|humans]] listed women no higher than 27th, Nadia was prompted to start [[Genius In action Research Labs (Earth-616)|G.I.R.L.]], an enterprise to assess the [[Earth]]'s greatest female scientific minds and convince S.H.I.E.L.D. that their list was outdated and in need of revision.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 1}}

Nadia established her residence at Hank's former home, researching young women geniuses in the tri-state area to recruit into her G.I.R.L. initiative, with Jarvis helping her keep her schedule of affairs in order. Nadia traveled to Washington Heights and recruited sisters [[Alexis Miranda (Earth-616)|Alexis]] and [[Taina Miranda (Earth-616)|Taina]], but could not recruit [[Lunella Lafayette (Earth-616)|Moon Girl]] even after a superhero team-up, the aftermath of which led Nadia to find her Red Room friend, Ying; who vanished after explaining her orders from [[Mother (Red Room) (Earth-616)|Mother]] to bring Nadia back into the Red Room. After Nadia got a new phone and first met [[Amber Silverstein (Earth-616)|Amber]], she and Jarvis travelled for Brownsville and recruited [[Priscilla LaShayla Smith (Earth-616)|Shay Smith]], but found trouble convincing [[Priya Aggarwal (Earth-616)|Priya Aggarwal]] to join; as Priya wanted to be "normal" as her brother's exceptionalism led to his loneliness.{{r|{{cl|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 2}}-[[Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 3|3]]}}

When the shop Priya worked at was being robbed by [[Marian Pouncy (Earth-616)|Poundcakes]], Nadia talked her down until Jarvis encountered [[Hellen Feliciano (Earth-616)|Letha]] outside and fighting broke out. When Nadia lost her composure and utilized her assassin training to subdue both criminals, Priya agreed to join in gratitude. The next day, after an awkward first encounter, Nadia's [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|lawyer]] stated that there was no DNA of Hank left to verify she is his daughter, complicating her naturalization case. So he petitions Asylum for her that she is protected while Nadia detail events of the Red Room until her lineage is proven.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 4}}

===[[Kang War]]===
After [[Samuel Alexander (Earth-616)|Sam Alexander]], [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Miles Morales]], and Kamala Khan left the Avengers to found the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]],{{r|Champions Vol 2 1}} Nadia stayed with the team, who also recruited [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] to bolster their ranks. They were then invited by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]] to [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]]' main headquarters, the [[Baxter Building]], where Peter offered them a new base of operations outside of the old hangar; however, Nadia finally realized that Peter was connected to Spider-Man and grew immediately distrustful of the businessman due to her distrust of Spider-Man.{{r|Avengers Vol 7 1}}

After being rescued from having been erased from time by Hercules, Nadia took [[Nathaniel Richards (Infant) (Earth-6311)|the infant Kang]] and used [[Kang Armor|his adult self's time-travelling tech]] to escape into the timestream to return the baby to [[Earth-6311|its proper place in history]].{{r|Avengers Vol 7 2}} During her chase, she was plucked out by the [[Priests of Pama (Earth-17383)|Priests of Pama]] from [[Earth-17383|the 26th Century]], who had evolved into paradox eaters after [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang]]'s attack on [[Priests of Pama (Earth-616)|the group]] searching for his younger self in [[Earth-616|the past]]. They attempted to convince Nadia to sacrifice the baby to them so that all of his future crimes would be undone; however, Nadia refused and instead plunged herself back into the timestream to rescue the Avengers murdered by Kang and drawing the attacking time-travelers to the Priests. The Avengers were then able to successfully return the child to his time and was thanked by the Avengers for her work, though the Vision told her a shocking secret.{{r|Avengers Vol 7 3}}<!--

===Encounter with A.I.M.===
With the USAvengers defunct after HYDRA's short-lived coup, classic A.I.M. returned under Monica Rappaccini to reclaim her role as Scientist Supreme. Nadia had to postpone her driving practice with Jarvis and went to intercept "Seeker", assaulting a bank in the Financial District. With Janet preoccupied gaining sponsorship for G.I.R.L., Nadia had drone assistance by Tai, Ying, Priya, and Shay to dispatch A.I.M. agents. Learning Seeker was [[Amber Silverstein]], who Nadia failed to recruit, Amber admitted to joining A.I.M. due to a forewarning by A.I.M. about Hank Pym possibly returning, and stole was an item meant as a countermeasure.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 2 1}} -->
