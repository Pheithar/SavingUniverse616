| HistoryText             = With [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the superhero community possibly compromised during the [[Secret Invasion]] of Earth, [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] felt his only option was to personally develop and cultivate a potential pool of talent from which to select agents. He created a list of potential super-powered agents that no one knew about, thus they hadn't been exposed or exploited. Nick Fury organized them into three teams, White, Grey, and Black, each led by an established agent he could trust.{{r|Secret Warriors #11|12}}
