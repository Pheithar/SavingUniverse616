===Origins===
Valerie Cooper gave a proposal for a new type of Sentinel that would be piloted. She cited that the government can not rely on the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] or the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], much less the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] during a crisis and thus needed its own sanctioned superhero team. The new models were developed by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]. [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|James Rhodes]] was selected as Direct Command Officer and instructor. Various candidates were selected to be part of this new Sentinel Squad.{{r|Sentinel Squad O*N*E #1}}

They were pushed hard, with initial 'training simulations' against the likes of [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] and the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]].{{r|Sentinel Squad O*N*E #1}} Their initial mission was to protect a senator targeted by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] due to his anti-terror legislation. They apprehended agents, who then triggered explosives and unleashed the [[Growing Man (Earth-6311)|Growing Man]]. Slayton was injured and the mission failed.{{r|Sentinel Squad O*N*E #2}}

The teams were sent to the [[Savage Land]] to stop a plot by the [[Savage Land Mutates (Earth-616)|Savage Land Mutates]] altering dinosaurs. Most of the squads were lost due to attacking head-on. Lexington's team managed to escape, also freeing Rhodes.{{r|Sentinel Squad O*N*E #3|4}}

The team then went to [[Ecuador]] to exterminate the Sentinels created by [[Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-616)|Cassandra Nova]].{{r|Sentinel Squad O*N*E #5}}

===[[M-Day]] & [[Decimation]]===
The [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]] was formally activated by the President due to the events of "[[M-Day]]". The squad was launched and headed to the Xavier Institute to monitor the remaining mutants.

They got into a brief quarrel with the X-Men but stopped after [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] revealed the units were piloted. The two groups then joined forces when the mutant hating fanatical group known as the [[Sapien League (Earth-616)|Sapien League]] attacked the Mansion.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 179}} The squad was stationed outside of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] and monitored the status of the mutants living there.

When Vulcan attacked the X-Men, he destroyed a Sentinel, along with killing [[Nathaniel Briggs (Earth-616)|Nathaniel Briggs]].{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #5}} During [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]]'s attack, two prototype Sentinels known as [[Crazy Train]] and [[War Machine (Sentinel)|War Machine]] were activated after Apocalypse destroyed the other sentinels.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 186}}

When [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|William Stryker]] went on his crusade against the X-Men students in an effort to kill them all, he used an arm of [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] to shut down the sentinels.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #27}} Later, [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]] destroyed a sentinel as well.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #31}}

When the 198 rioted, [[Absolon Mercator (Earth-616)|Mr. M]] stopped the Sentinels.{{r|X-Men: The 198 #1}}

When the [[Children of the Vault]] sent Northstar and Aurora to attack the X-Men, the sentinels could not get in to the mansion, where the fight was taking place.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #189}} Later [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]] stopped the sentinels also.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #202}}

The Sentinels were ultimately destroyed.<!-- By what? --> All units apparently died.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #493}}

===[[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]]===
During [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]], O*N*E agents operated on [[Sentinel Mk VIII|Mk VIII Sentinels]]{{r|All-New X-Factor #16}} in order to retrieve the [[Nuclear Detonation Device|"Nuclear Football"]] that [[X-Factor (Serval Industries) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] had stolen (due to the [[Barack Obama (Earth-616)|President]], under the affect of the hate wave, intending to use it to launch a full-scale nuclear conflict).{{r|All-New X-Factor #15}}

The Sentinels formed a siege against [[Serval Industries (Earth-616)|Serval Industries]]'s HQ, where the Football was stored, but were repelled by a force field, leading them to abduct [[Angela Snow (Earth-616)|Angela Snow]] as an hostage. Once the field was down, a battle opposed the Sentinels, and they were eventually destroyed by [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]].{{r|All-New X-Factor #16}}
