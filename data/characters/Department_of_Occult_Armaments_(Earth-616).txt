| History                 = The primary objective of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s Department of Occult Armaments was to find a way to develop an army of [[Vampires|vampiric]] stormtroopers for Hydra's terrorist army. Their first attempt to create a vampire soldier with a sample of [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]]'s DNA resulted in the creation of [[Bloodstorm One (Earth-616)|Bloodstorm One]], who savagely slaughtered everyone in the facility.{{citation}}

The D.O.A. was resurfaced years later to assist [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Sin]] to gather the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]]'s Hammers as a power source for the [[Sleeper|Final Sleeper]].{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless Vol 1 1|12}}

After betraying the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and joining forces with the D.O.A., [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]] tried to transform the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]] into one of his [[Monsters of Evil (Earth-616)|Monsters of Evil]] in order to use them as weapons for Sin and the D.O.A., but was ultimately defeated and incarcerated.{{r|Venom Vol 2 23|25}}

Some time later, [[Brock Rumlow (Earth-616)|Crossbones]], who was hunting anyone who had a [[Hell-Mark]], targeted [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Mania]] as she was in possession of a Hell-Mark that originally pertained to [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Venom]]. After battles involving [[demons]] and more demons, Crossbones and the D.O.A. were defeated and vanished.{{r|Venom Vol 2 40|42}}
