| History                 = 
===23rd century ([[Earth-715]])===
Toward the end of the twentieth century in one [[Earth-715|alternate timeline]], worldwide chemical and biological warfare broke out, resulting in the sterilization of 95% of the [[Earth]]'s female population. The fertile 5% seized political power and began a systematized program of oppression against men, who were seen as having nearly exterminated the species. By the early 23rd century, natural childbirth was totally supplanted by laboratory birthing, and men were bred only as servants, entertainers, and breeding stock. The major concerns of the United Sisterhood Republic, one of the leading nations of the new world, were exterminating the renegade bands of roving free men and preventing incursions from foreign nations and powers.{{Citation}}

Thundra was born in the Central Birthing Center of Greater [[Miago]] ([[Milwaukee]]-[[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]]), a government-run laboratory where fetuses are brought to term in artificial wombs. Genetically engineered for strength and endurance, Thundra was sent to military school when she was eight years old. By the age of eighteen, she had distinguished herself as the finest warrior in the Midwestern Republic and became an officer in the militia. She led assaults against roving bands of renegades and the armies of the Central American Empire.{{Citation}}

In the middle of Thundra's military career, Russia faced an invasion from soldiers from another alternate timeline, a world known as [[Earth-74101|Machus]]. Men from this alternate Earth had managed to overthrow their female oppressors generations previously, and used their technology for inter-dimensional travel to journey to Thundra's Earth to liberate the men of that world. In an attempt to strike back at the men of Machus, Thundra stole their dimensional apparatus, planning to launch a counter-attack on their world. The machine malfunctioned, however, and displaced her to the twentieth century. Afterafter acclimating herself, she decided to humble the strongest man on Earth, thereby, she believed, preventing the world of Machus from ever coming about.{{Citation}}

===Modern Era ([[Earth-616]])===
Upon her arrival, she was befriended by the criminal [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|The Wizard]], of the [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]], whose instruments detected Thundra's time displacement. The Wizard was looking for a replacement for [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]], and saw Thundra as an ideal choice. Thundra pretended to go along with the Wizard's plans in order to exploit his resources. She determined that the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] would be the ideal object lesson to vanquish in battle. Alongside the Frightful Four, she engaged the Thing in a battle, besting him fairly on at least one occasion. Recognizing that her actions in the past would have little bearing on the future, she betrayed the Frightful Four to become an ally of the Fantastic Four.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 129|133}}
[[File:Frightful Four (Earth-616) Wizard, Thundra, Sandman, Trapster from Fantastic Four Vol 1 130.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Alongside the Frightful Four]]

Thundra tried to help the Thing when he was mind switched with the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] but was knocked out in the process, however when she awoke she returned the blow that the "Thing" delivered to her earlier before walking off.{{r|Giant-Size Super-Stars Vol 1 1}}

Thundra came to the rescue one more time when the FF battled the Frightful Four again.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 148}} She then helped the team in a conflict against [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 149}}

[[Mahkizmo (Earth-74101)|Mahkizmo]], the greatest warrior of Machus, eventually trailed Thundra to the twentieth century and took her back to her own time to stand trial for her theft of the interdimensional travel equipment. The Fantastic Four followed Thundra (using their own means of travel) and helped Thundra battle against the dimensional invaders of Machus.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 151}} Before leaving the future for their own time, the Fantastic Four destroyed the mind-domination equipment of Machus and hoped that the two worlds would settle their differences amicably. Thundra returned to the twentieth century with them, believing that her world would be changed unfavorably by the presence of the extradimensional men.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 151|153}}

===Roxxon===
Some time later, Thundra was contacted by the Nth Command, subsidiary of the Roxxon Oil Company devoted to extradimensional research. They told her that a [[Earth-8009|divergent future world]] existed which was never invaded by Machus. She agreed to carry out a mission for them in exchange for being restored to her world. The mission was leading a band of female Roxxon operatives called the [[Grapplers]] into the government energy facility Project: Pegasus in order to sabotage it. She was apprehended in the process but was released so the authorities could track down the party that sent her. She briefly became an ally of [[Zhib-Ran (Earth-712)|Hyperion]] of the Squadron Sinister, another Roxxon operative.{{Citation}}

When she learned of the Nth Command's sinister motives, she stole one of the Nth Projectors, dimensional aperture synthesizers. Creating a portal to her own time, she went through it after bidding a fond farewell to the Thing, the twentieth-century male she had most learned to admire.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One Vol 1 67}} Hyperion attempted to follow her, but the portal closed while he was halfway through, stranding him in limbo.{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 1 7}} Thundra arrived in her new reality safely.{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 2 75}}

===United Sisterhood Empire===
Thundra became the ruler of the [[United Sisterhood Republic|United Sisterhood]] that existed in this alternate future and eventually found herself at war with the extradimensional kingdom [[Polemachus]] and its chauvinistic warrior monarch, [[Arkon (Earth-616)|Arkon]]. Towards the end of their long, bitter conflict, Thundra employed the hero teams [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] as pawns in her war with Arkon. However, the heroes helped Thundra and Arkon discover that they shared a strong mutual attraction, an attraction that ended their conflict when they became lovers.{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 2 75}} Afterwards, Thundra joined Arkon in Polemachus as his consort.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 358}}
[[File:Karia (Earth-616), Thundra (Earth-715) and Arkon (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 365 001.jpg|180px|thumb|right|With Arkon]]

Some months later, Thundra and Arkon sought the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]' aid in repairing Polemachus' energy ring and protecting the maiden Astra from becoming a human sacrifice to Polemachus' religious zealots led by the high priest Anskar.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 358}}

Arkon also had a rival in his Grand Vizier, who, over time, convinced Arkon to return Polemachus to a more barbaric lifestyle rather than rely on its science. The Grand Vizier then abducted the superhero and Avenger Photon along with the super-villains battling her at the time, the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]]. The Grand Vizier used the Wrecking Crew to depose of Arkon and Thundra, until the Avengers arrived to rescue their teammate and restore Arkon to the throne. Polemachus returned to its hybrid barbaric/scientific lifestyles.{{Citation}}

===Dealing with Hulks===
Eventually, Thundra returned to the United Sisterhood Empire. However, knowing that she couldn't lead forever, she began devising a plan to have worthy offspring to one day take her spot leading the fight against men. She announced to her warriors that she was going back in time to challenge the incredible Hulk, the strongest man of all time, but, in reality, Thundra was planning to get some DNA samples, so she could have his child. During their fight, she scrapped the inside of Hulk's cheek and took some cell samples that would hopefully be enough for the artificial insemination.{{r|Hulk: Raging Thunder Vol 1 1}}
[[File:Hulk Raging Thunder Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|180px|thumb|left]]

When she tried to get back to the Empire, the time machine malfunctioned and she was stranded in the present. During this time, she joined [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]]'s [[Lady Liberators (Earth-616)|Lady Liberators]] in a fight against [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]]. They managed to defeat him, but, while waiting for him to revert to his human form, he regained his strength and broke free, kidnapping Thundra in the process. When he got to a safe location, he revealed he knew of her story and wanted to start a partnership.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 7|9}}{{r|Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk Vol 1 2}}

The two fought alongside each other on many occasions, before Thundra finally managed to find a working time machine. Before departing to her time, Thundra kissed Red Hulk passionately, leaving him to hope, in vain, that she had actually taken some of his cells too.{{r|Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk Vol 1 2}}

Arriving at her time, her scientist were able to proceed with the insemination, and she successfully gave birth to a green-skinned warrior whom she called [[Lyra (Earth-8009)|Lyra]].{{r|Hulk: Raging Thunder Vol 1 1}}{{r|Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk Vol 1 2}}

Decades later, they met in the present and Thundra tried to reconnect with Lyra by taking her to [[Weirdworld (Battleworld)|Weirdworld]] for them to have adventures together.{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 4 15}}
