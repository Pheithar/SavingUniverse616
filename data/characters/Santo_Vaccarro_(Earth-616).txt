===New X-Men: Academy X===
'''Santo Vaccarro''' was sent to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] where he befriended [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]] and the would-be [[Hellions Squad (Earth-616)|Hellions Training Squad]]. He was originally advised by [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], but was selected by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] to be part of her prized Hellions Squad.<ref>{{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 1}} - {{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 4}}</ref> Santo and the rest of the Hellions went on to win the Field Day Tournament{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}} and were declared the best squad at the end of the school year.{{Citation}}

===Hellions===
[[File:Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616) from New X-Men Hellions Vol 1 1 0003.jpg|thumb|left|Rockslide]]
During the summer vacation, Julian, from a well-to-do background, invited his friends to his home. The Hellions ran into trouble quickly, as his and [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]]'s appearances along with [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]]'s dress disturbed people at the airport. After a brief struggle, the group was allowed to board, and made their way to Julian's home in [[California (State)|California]]. Soon, the team encountered the [[Kingmaker (Wallace) (Earth-616)|Kingmaker]], from whom they each received a trial wish. Santo's wish was to become a World-class Champion in superhuman wrestling. However, when the Hellions eventually refused a permanent deal with the Kingmaker, the Kingmaker shattered Santo with a laser blast. Julian used his telekinesis to piece Rockslide back together, and together the Hellions defeated the Kingmaker.{{r|New X-Men: Hellions Vol 1|4}}

===Decimation & Childhood's End===
Soon after returning to the school after the vacation, the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] created the reality known as the [[Earth-58163|House of M]]. In this reality, Santo was once again a champion superhuman wrestler. After the effects of [[Decimation|M-Day]], he was one of the few students who didn't lose their powers. The depowered students and staff were sent back to their homes. One bus was bombed by anti-mutant religious zealot [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Reverend William Stryker]], and Santo's former teammate and friend [[Brian Cruz (Earth-616)|Tag]] was among those killed. The [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] held a funeral for those students whose parents would not accept them, and Santo reflected upon how he had "failed" by not being able to save those killed.<ref>{{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 20}} - {{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 23}}</ref>

With the mutant population drastically decreased, the government sent the [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E (Earth-616)|Sentinel O*N*E* Squad]] to watch over the school, which began housing as many remaining mutants as would take refuge. All of the remaining students were placed by Emma Frost into an all-out brawl, and the ones deemed to be the best were to be assigned to become a group of in-training X-Men. Santo made the team and began training to become a X-Man.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 23}}

William Stryker continued his terrorist attacks against the school. Santo's teammate [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]] ended Stryker's plans by killing him. The New X-Men, with the help of [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|Prodigy]], then made the connection between Stryker and [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]]. The team leader, [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]], then decided that the team would find and destroy the robot. When the team confronted Nimrod, Rockslide was obliterated in the battle. Hellion and Mercury tried desperately to awaken and to piece him back together, but Rockslide's remains were initially unresponsive. Thankfully, even in his shattered form he was able to survive, and was finally put back together, only to become larger and more rugged than his previous form. Rockslide was later seen talking to [[Ben Hammil (Earth-616)|Match]] and [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]] about their abilities and how useful or non-useful they would be if they joined the New X-Men team, indicating Match and Anole may be possible candidates for admission onto the team. He was at the memorial service for all the students lost in Stryker's attack on the institute.<ref>{{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 24}} - {{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 31}}</ref>

===Mercury Falling & Quest For Magik===
Rockslide accompanied the X-Men when they jumped from the Blackbird to save Mercury from the Facility. He helped with great enthusiasm during the fight, and in the aftermath, made fun of [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]] and her powers, saying that being an X-Man must be "really hard". Kitty then jokingly threatened to kill him.<ref>{{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 33}} - {{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 36}}</ref>

[[File:Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 36 0001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Rockslide's new form]]
Santo and the other students were captured by [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]], and taken to [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]]. While hiding from Belasco, along with [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]], Match, Loa, Anole, [[Nicholas Gleason (Earth-616)|Wolf Cub]], [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]], and [[Nezhno Abidemi (Earth-616)|Gentle]], Santo was unsure what to do. As demons approached the group, Santo fought them off, but then seemingly exploded when he tried to shoot his fists at them. Santo reconstituted himself in a magma rock form impervious to magic and beat the badness out of [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Illyana]], who then helped them to rescue their fellow students and kill Belasco. Back home Rockslide threatened to quit if Pixie and Anole weren't made part of the New X-Men.<ref>{{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 37}} - {{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 41}}</ref>

===World War Hulk===
Rockslide was one of the New X-Men that went up against the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]. He knocked over the Hulk so the other students could hold him down, but was knocked away when Hulk regained his strength. When Rockslide attacked him alone, it appeared that Hulk knew who he was and what he could do. Hulk ripped off both his arms, stepped on him, and then tore off his legs. He then got rid of Rockslide's limbs by throwing them a great distance, preventing Rockslide from using his powers and the ability of ambulatory function. Ironically, Santo had stated that as a kid he pretended he was the Hulk.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 1}}

===Children of X-Men===
Rockslide was playing pool with X-23 and Anole; he and X-23 tried to convince Anole to let them cut his other arm off. After Santo called Anole a sissy, Anole got offended and pushed him out the window while Rockslide proclaimed "I swear I didn't know! Don't be so sensitive!" After Rockslide refused to blow himself up, Anole called him a sissy to get him to do it. Anole then offered to try and blow up Santo himself.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}}

Santo later agreed to stay up with [[Paras Gavaskar (Earth-616)|Indra]] because he was worried that he was going to die. While having an indoor campfire, Santo pointed out that it didn't matter how old they were, they're mutants and someone was going to come gunning for them, and when they did he wanted to go down fighting. Later, he outed Anole as gay to some of the other students, though Loa was already aware and said that everyone already knew of Anole's orientation.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 43}}

===[[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]]===
After the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] were disbanded,{{r|X-Men: Messiah Complex}} Rockslide was in [[Florida (State)|Florida]] when [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]] found him and explained her vision of their [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]] team. When [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]] (impersonating [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]) offered Santo a spot on the team, he agreed to join only if Blindfold was also accepted. The other young mutants recruited were Santo's former classmates [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]] and [[Nicholas Gleason (Earth-616)|Wolf Cub]], along with newcomer [[Eric Gitter (Earth-616)|Ink]].{{r|Young X-Men Vol 1 1}}

During their first adventure, the Young X-Men battled the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] and revealed Donald Pierce's charade. Unfortunately, Wolf Cub was killed, an event that hit Santo especially hard.{{r|Young X-Men #5}} Santo took out much of his anger on [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], but still agreed to join the X-Men in [[San Francisco]].{{r|Young X-Men Vol 1 6}}

Rockslide was one of the only Young X-Men to remain a full-time member. He participated in defeating the [[Y-Men (Earth-616)|Y-Men]],<ref>{{cl|Young X-Men Vol 1 8}} - {{cl|Young X-Men Vol 1 9}}</ref> the revelation of [[Alisa Tager (Earth-616)|Cipher]],{{r|Young X-Men Vol 1 10}} and the battle with [[Neo (Earth-616)|the Neo]] on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].{{r|Young X-Men Vol 1 12}}

When Dust seemingly died, Rockslide went into a berserker rage and almost killed Donald Pierce again. Santo seemed moved the most by the death of his friend, and was filled with joy when she was revived.{{r|Young X-Men Vol 1 12}}

===[[Secret Invasion]], [[Utopia (Event)|Utopia]] & X-Infernus===
During the [[Skrulls|Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] of [[Earth]], Rockslide was teamed with [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] in battle.

Later, along with Hellion, Rockslide was one of the mutants inciting the riots in [[San Francisco]] during [[Simon Trask (Earth-616)|Simon Trask's]] Humanity Now! and [[Proposition X]] rallies.

While Santo and Mercury watched a training session between Pixie and Nightcrawler, Pixie suddenly stabbed Kurt with her [[Souldagger]]. They ran in and moved Pixie away from Kurt's unconscious body. When Beast entered Pixie regained her senses. After she removed her dagger, Magik's [[Soulsword]] emerged from Kurt's chest and Magik teleported in ready to reclaim her sword.

Rockslide took on Illyana, thinking he was still resistant to magic, forgetting that his resistance occurred only when he was composed of Limbo's terrain. Illyana shocked him by easily defeating him. After he reformed, the gathered X-Men held a meeting and he along with Mercury were put on a team of more magic-resilient X-Men being sent to Limbo.

Rockslide reformed out of Limbo's terrain as the team entered Belasco's castle to assist Pixie. Finding Illyana defeated by [[Ananym (Earth-616)|Witchfire]] and Pixie transformed into a demon, Rockslide and Mercury were forced to fight magically mind-controlled [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].<ref>{{cl|X-Infernus Vol 1 1}} - {{cl|X-Infernus Vol 1 3}}</ref>

===Schism & Regenesis===
After the [[Schism (Event)|Schism]], Santo went to [[Westchester County|Westchester]] along with many other mutant students.{{Citation}}

===Death of X===
After Cyclops telepathic call to arms against the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]], Santo was seen at Muir Island to bury and mourn the mutants who died from the [[Terrigen Mist]].{{r|Death of X Vol 1 2}} Later, he joined Cyclops team who were sent to contain the Inhumans and Storm's team.{{r|Death of X Vol 1 3}} After the death of Cyclops and the week-long negotiations with the Inhumans, Santo attended Cyclops funeral with the rest of the X-Men.{{r|Death of X Vol 1 4}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Santo was one of the many mutants that opposed the crazed [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] from remaking the world in his image. When X-Man realized that his vision of the world would never come about with the X-Men around, X-Man made his enemies vanish in an instant, including Santo.<ref>{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 1}} - {{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 10}}</ref>

===Age of X-Man===
Santo and the others were transported to another [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|plane of existence]] by X-Man created in an attempt at a utopia where they and all other mutants would be at peace, altering their memories so they wouldn't resist.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}

Rockslide was a student of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Summers Institute for Higher Learning]] and was a member of its History Division.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 1}} He was in the library looking at books when [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Dean Angel]] welcomed a new student named [[Luna (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Luna]].{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}

Rockslide showed up in the lunchroom eating when [[Iara Dos Santos (Earth-616)|Shark-Girl]] brought up in front of the other students that [[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob]] was writing a [[X-Men Disassembled|fan fiction]] based on a mission of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and all of them were involved in this battle where [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]] got hurt and Rockslide got beat up by the four-armed villain known as [[Michael McCain (Earth-616)|Forearm]]. [[Megan Gwynn (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Pixie]] then grabbed Glob's notebook in order to read it, but she was stopped by [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]]. They all decided to meet up later at the library to study.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 1}}

Rockslide was seen briefly in [[Madison Jeffries (Earth-616)|Mr. Jeffries']] room as he taught the history surrounding [[Hope Summers (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]]' sacrifice so that the rest of [[Homo superior|mutantkind]] could live on.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 1}}

Later, as Santo and the others arrived at the [[Hope Summers Memorial Library]] to study, Santo noticed a fire ablaze further downtown. Armor and Pixie decided to help out, saying that Civil Management was what they trained for.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 1}}

Rockslide and the others made their way down to the large house burning down. As he stood in front of the fire, he became surprised to see the [[X-Men (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] front and center ready to contain the situation.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 1}}

Santo was eventually allowed to leave X-Man's reality when X-Man decided to release the mutants he trapped there.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

===Krakoa===
Santo later became a citizen of the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. He attended the celebration of Krakoa being officially recognized as a nation. He was seen standing near [[Ben Hammil (Earth-616)|Match]] at the party on Krakoa while Wolverine handed [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] a beer.{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}}

Santo later befriended a mutant who was from [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]] in the forest of Krakoa, [[Summoner (Arakko) (Earth-616)|Summoner]], who he played a traditional Arakko game with, which reveals weakness in each player. Growing closer, he went with Summoner to Arakko to rescue [[Gunther Bain (Earth-616)|Unus]], only to be betrayed and killed by Summoner, by destroying his energy form.{{r|X of Swords: Creation Vol 1 1}} When the [[Five (Earth-616)|Five]] attempted to resurrect Santo, they learned, to their horror, that because he died in Otherworld, the real Santo perished as well as Otherworld is a nexus to the multiverse. The copies of Santo within [[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebro]] were overwritten in all backup helmets and the [[Santo Vaccarro (Multiverse)|version]] that was resurrected was instead a combination of other Santos from across the multiverse. In order to honour his death, [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] used his remains to build the [[Voltus Glade|portal]] for the [[X of Swords|Ten of Swords]] challenge.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 4}}

| Powers                  = *'''Geokinetic Psychic Entity:''' Santo's body is composed completely of inorganic granite. When Santo was first shattered by the Kingmaker and put back together by [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]],{{r|New X-Men: Hellions #4}} it was much like how [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] in her diamond form was reanimated by [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]].{{r|New X-Men #141}} Santo's body was next obliterated by Nimrod, only to eventually put itself partially back together (Santo needed Julian's help again to fully reform). This time his appearance became larger and more rugged.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 28}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 31}} The third insistence where Rockslide's body was destroyed, was in Limbo. However, this time he returned as a large lava/magma elemental type creature. It is unknown whether this is controllable or if it is a passive regenerative ability that occurs when Rockslide's body is destroyed.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 37}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 41}} After this episode, it's hypothesized by [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] that given Santo's three experiences reforming his body after being destroyed, Santo is actually a non-physical psychic entity that can form and control a stone "golem".{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}}

[[File:Henry McCoy (Earth-616) and Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 42 0001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rockslide reforming his body in front of [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]]]]
*'''''Rock Explosions''''' & '''''Rock Projectiles:''''' Santo once was able to fire "granite projectiles" using his appendages, but now has the power to explode on command and reform himself from any surrounding rocks. His projectiles were fired with Level Five Force.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 33}}

*'''''Superhuman Strength:''''' Rockslide has continuously been shown performing great feats of strength. Rockslide possesses superhuman strength. He is capable of lifting 75 tons.<br>

*'''''Superhuman Stamina:''''' Rockslide's musculature generates less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. He can exert himself at peak capacity for at least several hours before fatigue begins to impair him.<br>

*'''''Superhuman Durability:''''' Rockslide's extremely dense bodily tissue is considerably harder and more resistant to injury than the body of an ordinary human. He can withstand great impact forces, high caliber bullets, temperature and pressure extremes, and falls from great heights without sustaining any injury.<br>

Rockslide was considered a '''General Threat''' by the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]], at the time of the [[M-Day]].{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}} [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] classified him as a '''Threat Level: Medium''',{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 31}} and after defeating him, he was red-flagged and allegedly reclassified by the O*N*E.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 33}}

|Strength                 = * Rockslide is capable of lifting within the class 75 range.
|Abilities                = * '''''Combatant:''''' Rockslide is a good hand to hand combatant.
| Weaknesses              = * '''''Energy Blasts:''''' He can be split into pieces by powerful energy blasts from enemies such as Nimrod.
* '''''Geokinesis:''''' Because Rockslide's body is composed of rock or earth, he is susceptible to others who control rock materials like [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]].{{r|Young X-Men #2}}
* '''''Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder:''''' Santo was mentioned to be suffering from residual targeting, a type of PTSD which led him to attack Cyclops after his experiences with Pierce masquerading as Cyclops and killing Wolf Cub.{{r|Young X-Men Vol 1 6}}
* '''''Rock Separation:''''' If parts of his body are ripped off and thrown very far away they will not come back, as demonstrated by Hulk.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #1}}

[[File:Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616) from Young Avengers Vol 2 12 0001.png|thumb|right|320px|Indeed...]]
* Santo has formed very close friendships with [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Victor]], [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Cess]], [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Julian]], [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Ruth]], and [[Nicholas Gleason (Earth-616)|Nicky]]; however, he is friendly with most (if not all) of the [[Xavier Institute student body|young mutants]].
* The idea of Santo desiring to be a world-class wrestler has reoccurred twice: once in the {{cl|New X-Men: Hellions Vol 1|Hellions limited series}} and again in the [[Earth-58163|House of M reality]].
* Santo enjoyed pizza, wrestling and French pastries. He disliked vegetables, weaklings and homework. Santo was voted 'most likely to be famous' among his peers.{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}
* Santo once highly respected the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] and even pretended when he was playing "super hero battles" as a child,{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #1}} but changed opinion when the Hulk attacked the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #1}}
* Rockslide has said he'd like to take on [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 34}}
* Rockslide has performed some kind of sexual harassment on some female characters wearing suggestive costumes. Examples include [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]]{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 28}} and [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Transonic]].{{r|Generation Hope #12}}
* Rockslide lacks genitals.{{r|Avengers Academy #38}} He proved it by showing his naked body at the battle between the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]], the Thin Spandex Line (a gathering of teens and young adult heroes), and the numerous alternate [[Young Avengers]] of [[Mother (Interdimensional Parasite) (Earth-TRN287)|Mother]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 12}}
