| History                 = Chandu is a 12th Century mystic associated with Black John and [[Modred (Earth-616)|Modred]]. Chandu helped capture and imprison King Richard the Lion Heart and opposed [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|The Black Knight]] and the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] when they attempted to free Richard.<!-- {[r|Defenders Vol 1 11}} -->

Chandu is able to summon extremely powerful Gnomes from his mystical flames and smoke.  These Gnomes have the power to fell the Silver Surfer and stand toe to toe with the Hulk.  Unfortunately, [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|the Sub-Mariner]] determined that the Gnomes disinegrate when exposed to water.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 11}}

In modern times, Chandu and a host of other mystics calling themselves the [[Convocation of Wizards (Earth-616)|Convocation of Wizards]] attacked [[Avengers Mansion]] looking for [[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Doctor Druid]]. They wanted Druid's secrets of eternal youth, as well as the [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight's]] [[Ebony Blade]]. During this assault on Avengers Mansion, Chandu fought the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] and defeated him with his magical attacks.<!-- {{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 22}} -->

During this same attack, another member of the Convocation of Wizards named [[Paul Richarde (Earth-616)|Le Sabre]] forced [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] to surrender by taking a hostage. Chandu then used the Vision's body to bind Hercules. [[Sersi (Earth-616)|Sersi]] reformed the damaged Vision into three miniature versions of himself who then went on to defeat Chandu. Sersi then restored the Vision to his proper form.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 22}}

| Powers                  = Chandu is an adept sorcerer who invokes many of the mystical entities that [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] himself uses in his spell casting. Chandu can fire mystical bolts of energy from his hands and create very powerful Earth-gnomes. It is unknown if Chandu has found a way to slow his aging or if he is a time-traveler, as his original time period was the 12th Century A.D.
