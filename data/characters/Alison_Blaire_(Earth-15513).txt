===[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]===
After the apparent death of [[Antimatter (Earth-616)|Antimatter]] tore holes in the barrier between realities,{{r|A-Force Vol 2 4}} Thor followed the [[Dia Sloane (Earth-11131)|Countess]], a shape-shifting sorceress with the power of warping reality itself, into the [[Exo-Space]], allowing both to avoid the eventual destruction of Battleworld, though she encountered [[Terrigen Mist]] therein.{{r|A-Force Vol 2 7}}

After what seemed like an eternity, the pair arrived in [[Astoria (Oregon)|Astoria]], [[Oregon (State)|Oregon]], of [[Earth-616]] and was seen by the newly formed [[A-Force (Earth-616)|A-Force]] of that reality fighting Countess (then, in the form of a dragon).{{r|A-Force Vol 2 5}} Alison befriended the members of this team and she learned that her counterpart was experiencing [[Terrigen]] poisoning and was dying.{{r|A-Force Vol 2 5}}

After a while in this Universe, Dazzler Thor also contracts [[M-Pox]], and, when Countess is defeated, Dazzler Thor finally succumbs to the effects of the Terrigen Mists and vanishes, leaving [[Lightbringer|her hammer]] behind.{{r|A-Force Vol 2 6|7}}
