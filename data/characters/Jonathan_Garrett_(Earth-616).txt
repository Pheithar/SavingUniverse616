===Early Life===
'''John Garrett''' had a colorful criminal career, he served three months at [[Dannemora State Prison]] for assault. He served two years at [[Ryker's Island]] prison for grand larceny, and spent six months on a [[Kentucky (State)|Kentucky]] work farm for attacking a police officer. Garrett committed several other crimes, including battery, four counts of statutory rape, and sixty-five counts of being drunk and disorderly.{{r|Elektra Assassin #6}} He was later recruited into the [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|C.I.A.]].{{r|Secret Warriors #9}}

===[[Zodiac (Great Wheel) (Earth-616)|Great Wheel]]===
[[File:Zodiac (Great Wheel) (Earth-616) Secret Warriors Vol 1 25 001.jpg|left|thumb|330px|The [[Zodiac (Great Wheel) (Earth-616)|Great Wheel]]]]
John, along with other intelligence agents [[Vasili Dassaiev (Earth-616)|Vasili Dassaiev]], [[Thomas Davidson (Earth-616)|Thomas Davidson]], [[Shoji Soma (Earth-616)|Shoji Soma]], [[Cornelius van Lunt (Earth-616)|Cornelius van Lunt]], [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]], [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]], [[Jacob Fury (Earth-616)|Jake Fury]], [[Daniel Whitehall (Earth-616)|Daniel Whitehall]], and [[Viktor Uvarov (Earth-616)|Viktor Uvarov]], were called by [[Leonardo da Vinci (Earth-616)|Leonardo Da Vinci]] alias [[Aries]] to form the [[Zodiac (Great Wheel) (Earth-616)|Great Wheel of Zodiac]]. Each member was assigned a codename from the Zodiac Calendar, John being '''Aquarius'''. The group consisted of the best covert intelligence agents from around the globe. After only a few key missions for Da Vinci, he would provide them with resources that would be of great value to their own separate agendas. The Great Wheel later fell apart due to the betrayal of [[Vasili Dassaiev (Earth-616)|Vasili Dassaiev]] and [[Viktor Uvarov (Earth-616)|Viktor Uvarov]].{{r|Secret Warriors #25}} 

===[[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]===
The broken Wheel led to the creations of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], [[Leviathan (Earth-616)|Leviathan]], and the [[Zodiac Cartel (Earth-616)|Zodiac Cartel]]. Despite a history of repeated criminal offenses John ended up becoming an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., with his past records clandestinely expunged.{{r|Secret Warriors #25}}

===Chastity McBryde===
Agent Garrett served in [[Libya]] alongside agent [[Chastity McBryde (Earth-616)|Chastity McBryde]], impressing her with his combat skills. But when he made advances, she punched him in the nose. Chastity discovered that there were no records on Garrett. When she brought this to the attention of [[ExTechOp (Earth-616)|ExTechOp]], she not only received no reply, but was also swiftly transferred to a minor police action in [[Venezuela]]. She filed a complaint to Nick Fury which never arrived. Chastity continued her investigation, using S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Central Command Computer Facility and cross-referencing law enforcement records from seven states.{{r|Elektra Assassin #6}} 

===Operation: Scrambled Eggs===
[[File:Jonathan Garrett (Earth-616) 2.jpg|left|thumb|Agent Garrett]]
After receiving certain injuries in his line of duty, John was provided with a steel plate in his head that could house a recorder, as well as a cybernetic left hand.{{r|Elektra Assassin #2}} With fellow agent [[Arthur Perry (Earth-616)|Arthur Perry]], John was sent to [[San Conception]] as part of Operation: Scrambled Eggs to investigate the assassination of the nations president. The assassin unfortunately turned out to be [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]], and after being confronted by the two agents, she left them to die in an explosion.{{r|Elektra Assassin #3}} 

Recovered by S.H.I.E.L.D. and upgraded to a cybernetic body by ExTechOp, John swore revenge against Elektra. He discovered her next mission was to stop [[Hand (Earth-616)|The Hand]] from gaining a presidential foothold over the USA with candidate [[Ken Wind (Earth-616)|Ken Wind]], who'd been possessed by the Hand's [[Beast (Demon) (Earth-616)|Beast]], and so he allied himself with her for the sake of the world.{{r|Elektra Assassin #4|#8}}

===Snakeroot===
It was revealed that Elektra had used her hypnotic abilities to make Garrett believe that he was Ken Wind and had become president. In reality, Agent Garrett remained in a dismantled state in S.H.I.E.L.D. Substation 14.{{r|Daredevil #319}} Agents of the [[Snakeroot (Earth-616)|Snakeroot]] attacked the facility, and [[Tekagi (Earth-616)|Tekagi]] revived Agent Garrett.{{r|Daredevil #320}} In the stronghold of the Snakeroot, Tekagi revealed that since Agent Garrett and Elektra had merged on the plane of the mind, a fragment of her persona still existed within Agent Garrett's mind. Tekagi detailed the plan to draw out the dark essence of Elektra from Garrett's mind, and place it into a new warrior to serve the Snakeroot, and the shadow warriors initiated the process.{{r|Daredevil #321}} The Snakeroot transferred the dark essence of Elektra from Garrett's mind into a female corpse, which was reanimated as [[Erynys (Earth-616)|Erynys]]. Technicians continued the process of rebuilding Garrett.{{r|Daredevil #322}} As the completed Agent Garrett and Erynys stood before the Snakeroot, Garrett insulted [[Edward Passim (Earth-616)|Eddie Pasim]].{{r|Daredevil #323}} Agent Garrett and Erynys assaulted [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] and the [[Chaste (Earth-616)|Chaste]] member [[Stone (Chaste) (Earth-616)|Stone]]. Agent Garrett continued to confuse Erynys for Elektra. When the real Elektra showed up they fought but ultimately had to escape.{{r|Daredevil #324}}

Agent Garrett and Erynys accompanied the Snakeroot and the Hand as they tried to force Passim to relocate the missing sample of the About Face virus. Garrett defended Erynys when the Snakeroot criticized her failure to kill Daredevil. Agent Garrett and Erynys were also present alongside the Snakeroot when they confronted Daredevil and Elektra, who had located the virus. Agent Garrett was severely confused by the presence of both Erynys and Elektra. Erynys' persona was merged with Elektra when the former died. Garrett was captured and placed in a detention cell where he demanded to be given a copy of this month's Soldier of Fortune.{{r|Daredevil #325}} On the [[Helicarrier]], Fury questioned Agent Garrett, who convinced him that he should be given credit for what he had done for his country, regardless of how he had gone about it.{{r|Daredevil #326}} Nick Fury had Agent Garrett reactivated as an agent and sent the cyborg [[John Kelly (Earth-616)|Siege (John Kelly)]] to watch over him.{{r|Daredevil #330}} Agent Garrett attempted to apply for unemployment: He had left past employment empty.{{r|Daredevil #341}}Agent Garrett kicked down the door at [[Karen Page (Earth-616)|Karen Page]]'s place and killed several [[cockroaches]] to demonstrate his skills to her, who had placed an advertisement for a private investigator to help her uncover crimes.{{r|Daredevil #342}}

===War with [[Leviathan (Earth-616)|Leviathan]]===
[[file:Jonathan Garrett (Earth-616) from Secret Warriors Vol 1 23 Cover.jpg|thumb|right]]
Agent Garrett was one of the unaffiliated agents in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.{{r|Secret Warriors #1}} He became sober and moved to [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] and opened "Natchios' Total Car Pit". Nick Fury tracked him down and called him out of retirement.{{r|Secret Warriors #7}} Fury and Agent Garrett traveled to [[Alexandria (Virginia)|Alexandria]], [[Virginia (State)|Virginia]]. Fury showed Garrett the file of agent [[Seth Waters (Earth-616)|Seth Waters]] a known double agent. He sent him to learn the truth about Agent Waters.{{r|Secret Warriors #8}} Agent Garrett went into the US Department of Treasury to speak to Agent Waters, who was shocked that he did not set off the metal detectors. It was revealed that his body was made completely of polycarbonate. Agent Waters revealed that he knew about the [[Fury Secret Base 7|Pieta (Fury Secret Base 7)]] and his masters know everything and are everywhere!{{r|Secret Warriors #9}} 

===[[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]]===
Agent Garrett flew Fury to [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] using a [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Flying Car]]. Fury told [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] about Agent Waters and that he was a national security issue resulting in Waters' capture by [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]]. [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]] interrogated Agent Waters. Agent Garrett shot Waters with a sniper rifle from the car when Walters revealed he was working for [[Leviathan (Earth-616)|Leviathan]]. Nick Fury was with Osborn during the interrogation, but escaped under Agent Garrett's cover fire, taking out a number of H.A.M.M.E.R. agents and helicopters.{{r|Dark Reign: The List - Secret Warriors #1}}

===Howling Commandos===
At the [[Fury Secret Base 7|Pieta]] base, Nick Fury conferred with Dum Dum Dugan, Agent Garrett and the Professor planned the next actions against Hydra and Leviathan. Agent Garrett told Fury not to hesitate because now was the time to end the other organizations.{{r|Secret Warriors #16}} Agent Garrett traveled to [[Sudan]] where he met many former [[Secret Warriors (Earth-616)|"Howling Commandos"]], [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Commander Steve Rogers]], and [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]] at the [[Sandbox (Location)|Sandbox (Fury Secret Base 4)]] for a final get together.{{r|Secret Warriors #17}} Agent Garrett enjoyed a a final party with his friends reminiscing about old times.{{r|Secret Warriors #18}} He participated in the toast to fallen allies.{{r|Secret Warriors #19}} 

===Secret Warriors===
[[File:Jonathan Garrett (Earth-616) from Secret Warriors Vol 1 23 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
Agent Garrett met with [[Sebastian Druid (Earth-616)|Sebastian Druid]] and brought him back to the [[Secret Warriors (Earth-616)|Secret Warriors]]. He trained the young hero so he could go back into the field.{{r|Secret Warriors #23}} They traveled to [[China]] to use magic to make two destroyed Helicarriers from a recent battle with Hydra disappear. Agent Garrett was impressed, but still wanted to know how Druid worked under pressure. Agent Garrett next took Druid to Leviathan's Ursa Major base. Agent Garrett had Druid create a mystic bullet, which he used to shoot [[Vasili Dassaiev (Earth-616)|Magadan]]. The mystic component of the bullet sprayed Magadan's blood in Hydra's symbol on the wall behind him to sow dissension between the groups. They went after them, but while Druid was unable to teleport them to safety under pressure, the pair managed to escape. They then flew to Hydra's [[Gehenna (Hydra Base)|Gehenna base]] to retrieve the Secret Warriors. At Fury's [[Excalibur (Location)|Excalibur (Fury Secret Base 26)]] base they learned [[James Taylor James (Earth-616)|Hellfire]] had been the traitor. Agent Garrett thanked them for their hard work, but the team had been deactivated.{{r|Secret Warriors #25}} Shortly after, Agent Garrett officially rejoined S.H.I.E.L.D. under [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Daisy Johnson]]'s command.{{r|Secret Warriors #28}}

===S.H.I.E.L.D. vs. A.I.M.===

[[File:Caterpillars (Earth-616) from Secret Warriors Vol 1 28 0001.jpg|right|thumb|380px|[[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] reassembled]]

After assisting S.H.I.E.L.D. in a mission to recover the hacktivist [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] from [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]],{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 10}} Garrett became involved in the operations to find A.I.M.'s furtive leader, [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Roberto Da Costa]]. To help this end, Garrett had S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ExTechOps division hack the [[Life-Model Decoy|LMD]] body of fellow agent Dum Dum Dugan, turning him and all of his spare robot bodies into a mindless machine army.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 12}}

This development coincided with the emergence of an [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] [[Glossary:Precognition|precog]] named [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses Cain]]. One of Ulysses' predictions situationed S.H.I.E.L.D.'s agent [[Melissa Gold (Earth-616)|Songbird]] at Roberto's funeral. The discovery that Songbird had a connection with Da Costa prompted Garrett to apprehend and interrogate her for the location of [[Avenger Base Two]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 13}} Songbird instead set up Garrett against [[World Headquarters for International Scientific/Philosophical Experimentation and Research (Earth-616)|W.H.I.S.P.E.R.]], another enemy of A.I.M., and tricked Garrett into nuking their base instead.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 15}}

The [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] rescued Songbird from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, but Garrett tracked their teleport energy to Avenger Base Two and assaulted it with the army of Dugans.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 16}} A.I.M. scientist [[Toni Ho (Earth-616)|Toni Ho]] managed to free Dugan from Garrett's influence, and he punched John's head off his robotic body once he came back to his senses. However, due to his cyborg biology, he survived and would be put on trial for his betrayal and crimes.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 17}}
