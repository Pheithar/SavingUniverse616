===Origin===
'''Joanna Cargill''' was born to an abusive ex-soldier father who favored his son and always lashed out at her for any reason. When the news of her [[Gareth Cargill (Earth-616)|brother's]] death reached her father, he brutally beat her, causing her powers to activate. She tried to defend herself by punching him, only for her fist to go straight through his chest, killing him. Joanna was afraid of what she was and what she had done, so she ran away.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #268}}

[[File:Joanna Cargill (Earth-616) from X-Men Legacy Vol 1 208 0001.jpg|150px|thumb|left]]
===Alliance of Evil===
Joanna became a mercenary known as "'''Frenzy'''". During one mission, Frenzy came head-to-head with the mutant [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]], and she developed a love-hate relationship with him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #298}}

After Joanna witnessed [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] chained and put on trial by humans;{{r|Uncanny X-Men #200}} she became outraged and joined [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] in the hopes of getting even with humanity.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #252}} Apocalypse put her and three other individuals together to form the [[Alliance of Evil (Earth-616)|Alliance of Evil]], and she stayed with the group and served in several missions, pitting her against the mutant group [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] on a few occasions.{{r|X-Factor #33}}

Her first order from Apocalypse was to capture [[Russell Collins (Earth-616)|Rusty Collins]] and recruit him into their group. Her plan was foiled by X-Factor, and after a heated battle, she fled after being overwhelmed.{{r|X-Factor #4}} Using [[Michael Nowlan (Earth-616)|a mutant]] with the ability to enhance others' powers, Frenzy's strength and durability made her a difficult foe for the superheroes, but she was eventually defeated after the death of her power-heightening accomplice.{{r|X-Factor #5}} The Alliance of Evil were later defeated, and sent to prison by X-Factor.{{r|X-Factor #6}}

Frenzy and the Alliance of Evil would eventually break free from prison, and would revolt against the [[Mutant Registration Act]]. Thanks to X-Factor, Frenzy and her teammates were once again defeated.{{r|X-Factor #33}}

===Kings of Pain===
Frenzy and the Alliance of Evil were later hunted down by and fought [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable's]] [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]].{{r|New Mutants Annual #7}} Frenzy was captured and interrogated by [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] for information on [[Erika Benson (Earth-616)|Harness]] and [[Gilbert Benson (Earth-616)|Piecemeal]]. Domino held Frenzy half out of an X-Jet and threatened to drop her if she didn't tell her what she wanted to hear. After Frenzy finally caved and told Domino what she wanted to know, Domino still threw her from the jet, simply telling Cable that Frenzy would "probably" survive the fall.{{r|New Warriors Annual #1}}

===Femizons===
Later, Frenzy was given an invitation to join the S.S. Superia, a cruise ship owned by the villainess [[Deidre Wentworth (Earth-616)|Superia]]. There, Frenzy served alongside the [[Femizons (Earth-616)|Femizons]], a group of super-powered female criminals, and battled [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]]. She also broke free from the [[Vault (Prison)|Vault]], a prison for super villains, and created a ruckus with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Captain America #389}}

Frenzy would later join forces with many of Captain America's villains and fight him.{{r|Captain America #412}}

===Acolytes===
Frenzy eventually found acceptance under Magneto's teachings, but it was after he was believed deceased. She joined the ranks of the second incarnation of the [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]] and participated in several missions, relinquishing the codename Frenzy and preferring to be called by her last name, Cargill. Their first mission was to kidnap [[Teddy Matson (Earth-616)|a mutant child]] from a school called "Our Mother of the Sacred Heart." Cargill killed [[Sharon Friedlander (Earth-616)|Sharon Friedlander]], and with her teammates, [[Carmella Unuscione (Earth-616)|Unuscione]] and the [[Kleinstock|Kleinstock Brothers]], battled the gold [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] team. Cargill immediately chased after Gambit, but was knocked out when Gambit hit her with a charged tire.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #298}}

[[File:Joanna Cargill (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 300 0001.jpg|left|thumb|275px|With the Acolytes, fighting Iceman]]
She retreated, but during their next encounter with the X-Men, she battled [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]]. Although they had both changed from the X-Factor days, Cargill pummeled him until he gained enough power to defeat her with his new ice form.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #300}}

Cargill would later join the Acolytes during an attack on a hospice center under [[Fabian Cortez (Earth-616)|Fabian Cortez's]] orders.{{r|X-Factor #92}} [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]] soon introduced himself to the Acolytes and told them of Fabian Cortez's betrayal of Magneto. When Cargill and the Acolytes heard this, they abandoned Cortez and joined Magneto in his mutant sanctuary on [[Avalon (Greymalkin) (Earth-616)|Avalon]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #304}}

When the X-Men went to attack Magneto on Avalon, they forcibly teleported all of the Acolytes away. After Magneto nearly killed [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] wiped Magneto's mind clean, and Exodus assumed leadership of the Acolytes. Cargill remained on Avalon, believing Exodus could converse with the mindless Magneto.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 25}} Cargill and the Acolytes later fought Cable as well.{{r|Cable #10|11}}

While on a mission to recruit mutants into their cause, Cargill, along with [[Francisco Milan (Earth-616)|Milan]] and Unuscione, found the young, meek boy [[Simon Hall (Earth-616)|Neophyte]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #315}} After Neophyte betrayed the Acolytes,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #300}} Cargill was quick to vote guilty at his trial.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #315}} During the Fall of Avalon, Cargill allied herself with long-time enemy [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], and she and her fellow Acolytes were able to escape the destroyed space station in time.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #42|44}} They crash-landed in Australia and surrendered to the authorities.

The Acolytes escaped prison and found the remains of Avalon, worshiping it and the return of Magneto.{{r|Magneto #1|3}} Exodus eventually reclaimed leadership of the Acolytes, and Cargill participated in the attack on [[Mount Wundagore]], the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary's]] base of operations.{{r|Quicksilver #7}} During the [[Magneto War]], Cargill fought the X-Men yet again with the Acolytes.{{r|X-Men: Magneto War #1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #366|367}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 86}}

===Ambassador Cargill===
After the Acolytes disbanded, Cargill became ambassador for [[Genosha]] and served as Magneto's right hand woman.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #379}} She ordered that every country pledge loyalty to Magneto in order to be given some autonomy. Cargill was eventually captured by the US government in attempt to find out more of Magneto's plans, but she refused to speak.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #380}}

==="Joining" The X-Men===
The meeting in [[Washington, D.C.]] was cut short, as [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] entered and freed Cargill, giving her the option of joining Jean's new interim X-Men the easy way or the hard way. Cargill would not turn against her savior, so Jean used her powers to mind-control her into helping them. As a member of the X-Men, Cargill's personality was altered into a campy, awkward woman, far different from her confident, headstrong nature. Cargill's knowledge of [[Genosha]] helped the X-Men find Magneto's base. The inexperienced X-Men attacked but were quickly defeated. Cargill was used against her will to battle Magneto, but she was ultimately constrained with a metal pillar. After Magneto's defeat, Cargill was freed from her mind-control, and immediately left the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|X-Mansion]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #392|393}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 111|113}}

===Post M-Day===
Cargill disappeared for a while, but was one of the few mutants left after [[Decimation|M-Day]],{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}} and soon rejoined the Acolytes.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 3 1}}

When [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Sinister]] learned of the future birth of the first mutant after M-Day, he teamed up with the Acolytes. Cargill was with the group of Acolytes that searched for [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny's]] diaries at the Xavier Institute. Cargill also fought alongside the Acolytes and [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] during [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 44}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 205}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 46}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 27}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 207}}

In an effort to stop  Cable from taking the messiah baby to the future, [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] shot at him, missed and hit Charles Xavier instead.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 207}} Exodus quickly brought Charles Xavier's body to the New Avalon base thanks to [[Heather Tucker (Earth-616)|Tempo's]] powers,<ref>{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 207}}. off-panel</ref> Exodus planned to use his powers to repair Xavier's mind, a plan which Cargill opposed. {{r|X-Men: Legacy #208}} She tried to kill him, but her plans were thwarted by Erik Lehnsherr, who shot a surgical laser into her eye, blinding her and damaging parts of her brain.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 209}} Exodus kept her alive, but refused to help her as punishment for her insolence. However, Professor X later returned to New Avalon, and fixed Cargill's mind.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #225}}

After the downfall of the Acolytes, Joanna, now returning to her old codename Frenzy, went to San Francisco to riot against [[Simon Trask|Simon Trask's]] new law.{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1}} Frenzy teamed up with [[Nekra Sinclair (Earth-616)|Nekra]] on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] to fight the new [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]].{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Exodus #1}} She was later seen on Utopia during the [[Second Coming|attack]] of the [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrods]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 14}} After the battle, Frenzy again teamed up with Nekra, albeit this time in San Francisco, to fight an artist whose work they deemed as porn, claiming he was assaulting his models. They were taken out by [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]] and [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #528}}

[[File:Scott Summers (Earth-616) and Joanna Cargill (Earth-616) from New Mutants Vol 3 24 001.jpg|thumb|275px|Frenzy's love for Cyclops endures]]
===[[Age of X]]===
When one of [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion's]] rogue personalities warped reality, the inhabitants of [[Utopia]] were reborn in a new world. In [[Earth-11326|this reality]] Frenzy was a respected hero and married to [[Scott Summers (Earth-11326)|Scott Summers]]. After reality was restored to its proper state, Frenzy retained her memories of her other self, including her feelings for Cyclops. Frenzy joined the X-Men, hoping to become a hero, like [[Joanna Cargill (Earth-11326)|she]] was in [[Fortress X]]{{r|X-Men: Legacy #248|250}}. She refused to have her memory wiped and took up the look of her alternate reality counterpart.

Alongside [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], Magneto, Gambit, Professor X, and Legion, Frenzy helped track down several of Legion's rogue personalities that had escaped his mind.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #251|253}} After this, she helped to defend the [[Shi'ar]] from the [[Grad Nan Holts]], who were under the control of the villainous [[Friendless (Earth-616)|Friendless]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy #254|258}})

===Regenesis===
After the events of Schism, Frenzy chose to join Wolverine in reforming the School since she could not stand to see Scott and Emma together.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}} While at Westchester, she helped stop an attack by the [[N'Garai]]{{r|X-Men: Legacy #260.1}} When Exodus came to the school to force everyone to return to Utopia, a fight started, and he tried to mind-control Frenzy, but was stopped by Rogue.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #261}} Joanna was part of the team trying to stop Exodus from reaching Utopia after he decided that it was Cyclops who caused the mutants to split, and that for the mutants to be one people again, Scott must die.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #262}} When the [[Lights (Earth-616)|Generation Hope kids]] showed up to help, Joanna was appreciative of their aid and supported them despite the fact that Wolverine refused their aid. Together the two teams managed to subdue Exodus and he was imprisoned on Utopia.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #263}}

[[File:X-Men Legacy Vol 1 268 Textless.jpg|250px|thumb|left]]
===Avengers vs. X-Men===
Frenzy sided with her fellow mutants against the Avengers. When an Avengers team consisting of [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]], [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]], and [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]] arrived at the school in order to "keep an eye on" the mutants, Joanna wanted to kick them out, but was held back by Rogue. Joanna managed to provoke a fight however which prompted the rest of the staff to come to her aid. After She-Hulk seriously injured a couple of students who attacked her, the X-Men went all out, and despite intervention from a remote piloted Iron-Man suit, the Avengers were defeated.

After the [[Phoenix Five]] returned to Earth and began making the world better, Frenzy was sent to the African country of [[Narobia]] in order to root out and destroy the last remnants of a militia that was tormenting the civilian population. Frenzy completed her mission but managed to convince the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Cuckoos]] not to rewrite the memories of the refugees as Cyclops ordered, claiming that painful memories would help them endure the next time they were oppressed.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #268}}

===Inhumans===
[[File:Joanna Cargill (Earth-616) from All-New Inhumans Vol 1 1 002.png|thumb|right|Frenzy allies herself with the Inhumans]]
Frenzy reappeared sometime later attacking the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] imperial ship [[Royal Inhuman Vessel|R.I.V.]] as they were giving a tour to members of the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]]. Frenzy blamed the Inhumans for releasing a chemical attack on mutants and said she wasn't going to wait around to see what this new ship of theirs was capable of. So she picked up an aircraft and was about to throw it when [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]] intervened. She used her elemental abilities to entrap Frenzy in a hydro-kinetic bubble and shot her out of the ship's airlock. Later it was revealed that the whole fight was staged in order to gain the UN's support. Frenzy allied herself with Crystal in exchange for their help with saving mutants from the effects of the [[Terrigen Mist|Terrigen Cloud]].{{r|All-New Inhumans #1}}

===Secret Empire===
Alongside [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]] and [[Marshall Stone III (Earth-616)|Random]], Frenzy was briefly hypnotized by [[Johann Fennhoff (Earth-616)|Doctor Faustus]] to instigate conflict with [[Hydra (Earth-616)|HYDRA]]. Sunfire was captured by the organization, while Frenzy fled with the incapacitated Random. [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]] later told [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]] that there were no signs of Frenzy or Random.{{r|Secret Empire: United Vol 1 1}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Frenzy resurfaced after being summoned by Jean Grey to battle [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-1298)|Nate Grey]], who had possessed Legion's body.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9|10}}

===Krakoa===
Frenzy was eventually welcomed to the new mutant island of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], created by Xavier, Magneto, and [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira X]]. She entered through the teleportation gateway alongside other villainous and fractious mutants, who had been invited to join the nation in order to heal mutantdom and start over as a whole species together.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}

Frenzy was next seen in The Green Lagoon, a tiki bar set up by [[Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616)|Black Tom Cassidy]].{{r|X-Force Vol 6 9}}

===S.W.O.R.D.===
When [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]] reformed the space program [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]], Frenzy joined them as Earth's mutant ambassador. She was seen fighting the [[Kree/Skrull Alliance (Earth-616)|Kree/Skrull Alliance]] ambassador [[Paibok (Earth-616)|Paibok]] before giving him a proper tour. She was also greeted by [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa Council]] member Magneto who was also given a tour by Brand, while she told Paibok that she had once worshiped him long ago.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1}}

| Powers                  = Frenzy is a [[homo superior|Mutant]] who possesses a number of superhuman physical attributes as a result of genetic mutation:
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' Frenzy is superhumanly strong and she possesses sufficient physical strength to lift at least 10 tons, and perhaps more, as she has been noted going toe-to-toe with such notably superhumanly strong beings such as [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]].
* '''Superhuman Speed:''' Frenzy can run and move at speeds that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete. She is able to run at speeds around 100 km/h.
* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Frenzy's advanced musculature is much more efficient than that of an ordinary human. As a result, her muscles produce less fatigue toxins and those of a normal human. At her peak, she can exert herself physically for several hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in her blood begins to impair her.
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' Frenzy's bodily tissues are much tougher and more resistant to physical injury than those of a normal human. Frenzy's skin has been described as "steel hard", rendering her impervious to high caliber bullets, bladed weapons composed of most conventional materials, and temperature extremes of both heat and cold. Frenzy is also capable of withstanding great impact forces, such as being repeatedly struck with superhuman force or falling from great heights, without being injured. She can also withstand powerful energy blasts, such as those of Cyclops, with no visible damage. She's also been shown to be resistant to radiation. Frenzy describes herself as having "steel-hard" skin.{{citation}}
* '''Superhuman Agility:''' Frenzy's agility, balance and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.
* '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Frenzy's reflexes are similarly enhanced and are superior to those of the finest human athlete.

She was stated to be a '''Level 6 Threat''' by [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]],{{r|New Mutants Annual #7}} while the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]] classified her as a '''General Threat'''.{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}}
