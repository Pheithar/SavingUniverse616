| History                 = The Chitauri Wave was a fleet of [[Chitauri]] lured to [[Earth]] by the [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] sleeper agent [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America]] using a rejected plan created by the [[Ivan Kragoff (Earth-616)|Red Ghost]] for his Soviet superiors.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 8}} The plan consisted on hiding Chitauri queen eggs on Earth, with their presence driving the aliens into a frenzy to find them, ravaging anything in their path.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 10}}

The amount of Chitauri swarms that attempted to enter the Earth began to grow in both number and frequency. At one point, the [[Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] space initiative had to fend off the planet from four Chitauri waves in a single month.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 8}} After a gigantic Chitauri fleet was destroyed by [[Avril Kincaid (Earth-616)|Quasar]], it was expected that the next Chitauri fleet would be the largest single alien army to ever come to the Earth, and even bigger than the [[Annihilation Wave]].{{r|Civil War II: The Oath Vol 1 1}}

Another Chitauri fleet was approaching the Earth as the Hydra-loyalist Captain America was putting into motion a plan of conquest. While Alpha Flight and numerous other heavy-hitter heroes were deployed in orbit to fight the aliens, Captain America activated the [[Planetary Defense Shield]], sealing the heroes off from Earth. The Chitauri Wave continued mobilizing despite not being able to enter Earth, wearing off Alpha Flight and the heroes that were left stranded.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} The Planetary Defense Shield was eventually destroyed by Quasar, and [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] destroyed the Chitauri queen eggs, whose location had previously been pin-pointed, putting an end to the Chitauri invasion.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 8}}
