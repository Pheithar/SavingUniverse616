| Overview                = Zabu is the last known [[Smilodon]] (or saber-tooth tigers).{{r|Spider-Man Family Vol 2 7}}{{r|Marvel Pets Handbook #1}}

Living in the [[Savage Land]] (an artificial preserve for prehistoric wildlife), [[Antarctica]], he is the companion of [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]].{{r|Marvel Pets Handbook #1}}

| History                 = Except for those living in the [[Savage Land]], [[Smilodon]] (or saber-tooth tigers) became extinct during the [[Pleistocene]] period, the time during which the Earth experienced its last so-called [[Ice Ages]].

It was in the [[Savage Land]] that Zabu was born. While Zabu was still a cub, his [[Mara (Smilodon) (Earth-616)|mother]] and siblings were killed by the [[Man-Apes]], [[human]] natives of the Savage Land.{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage #11|12}}

Subsequently, Zabu was found by the wolf [[Zagah (Earth-616)|Zagah]], who brought him as food for his mate [[Thana (Earth-616)|Thana]], but she adopted him instead, letting him grew among her cubs [[Fheta (Earth-616)|Fheta]] (who admired Zabu) and [[Jhet (Earth-616)|Jhet]] (the eldest,{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage #11|12}} who grew to resent Zabu and hate Fheta for admiring him).{{r|Marvel Pets Handbook #1}}

In a struggle for supremacy,{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage #11|12}} after Jhet killed Fheta, Zabu was forced to slay him in combat, estranging him from his adoptive parents.{{r|Marvel Pets Handbook #1}}

Afterwards Zabu wandered the Savage Land on his own, teaching himself how to survive as he grew to adulthood.{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage #11|12}}

A year after his birth, Zabu first encountered the female who became his mate,{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage #11|12}} who became pregnant with Zabu's litter.{{r|Marvel Pets Handbook #1}}

[[File:X-Men Vol 1 10.jpg|200px|thumb|left]]
[[Maa-Gor (Earth-616)|Maa-Gor]], leader of a tribe of primitive Cavemen living in the Savage Land, had been leading his people in exterminating saber-tooth tigers, nearly rendering them extinct in the Savage Land. Maa-Gor and his men killed Zabu's mate. Enraged, Zabu tracked them down and found them about to attack the young boy [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Kevin Plunder]], who had come to the Savage Land with his explorer father, [[Robert Plunder (Earth-616)|Lord Robert Plunder]]. Maa-Gor and his men had just killed Kevin's father, and Maa-Gor probably would have then killed Kevin had not Zabu suddenly leapt on Maa-Gor from behind. Zabu scattered the tribesmen except for Maa-Gor, who, unseen by Zabu, was about to kill the tiger with his spear. But before Maa-Gor could do so, Kevin Plunder shot Maa-Gor in the shoulder with his father's gun.{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage #14|15}}

Zabu realized that Kevin had saved his life, and the two became companions. They went to dwell in the [[Place of Mists]], a region where Maa-Gor's tribe refused to set foot. There, Kevin grew to manhood, protected from all dangers by Zabu. Maa-Gor's people referred to Kevin as "Ka-Zar," which meant "son of the tiger."{{r|X-Men #10}}

Zabu remained Ka-Zar's companion when Ka-Zar became an adult, the strange gases within the Place of Mists retarding Zabu's aging, having him still in the prime of his life by the time Ka-Zar was an adult.{{r|Marvel Pets Handbook #1}}. After Ka-Zar again made contact with people from outside the Savage Land, he often brought Zabu with him on his journeys to the outside world.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 4}} Zabu also accompanied him to the home dimension of the [[Sheenarians]].{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 #16|19}}

Along with Ka-Zar and his wife [[Shanna O'Hara (Earth-616)|Shanna O'Hara Plunder]], Zabu escaped the destruction of the Savage Land at the hands of the alien [[Terminus (Destroyer) (Earth-616)|Terminus]].{{r|Avengers #257|258}} They later returned after the High Evolutionary restored the Land.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 12}}

Zabu accompanied Ka-Zar to [[New York City]] when [[Parnival Plunder (Earth-616)|Parnival Plunder]] teamed up with [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]]{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 1|10}} and was also with Ka-Zar when he returned to New York and was wrongfully accused in a shooting incident.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 14|17}} After returning to the Savage Land, Ka-Zar and his family were forced to temporarily leave their home{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 20}} but they soon returned and had reunited with Zabu.{{r|Captain America Vol 3 31}}

Sometime after this Ka-Zar attempted to elicit help from [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]], who was operating as a private detective at the time, to help track down Zabu who had gone missing, which she declined to involve herself with.{{r|Alias Vol 1 24}} Zabu was at some point reunited with Ka-Zar but then found himself physically fighting [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] who defeated and hog-tied him as part of a reality television show he was involved in, Ka-Zar and Shanna quickly tracked him.{{r|Hercules Vol 3 3}} Zabu was then returned to them after a party in [[New York City]] celebrating the success of Hercules' TV show.{{r|Hercules Vol 3 5}}

When the cosmic force known as the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] returned to Earth, it staged a contest to determine its next host, and Shanna, accompanied by Zabu, was one of many individuals summoned to the [[White Hot Room]] for it. The Phoenix empowered the assembled champions and had them fight each other in trials by combat.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 40}} After emerging victorious from fighting [[Devil Dinosaur (Earth-78411))|Devil Dinosaur]]{{r|Avengers Vol 8 41}} and [[Jason Strongbow (Earth-616)|American Eagle]],{{r|Avengers Vol 8 42}} Shanna and Zabu were pitted against [[Red Widow (Winter Guard) (Earth-616)|Red Widow]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 43}} The battle was even, but it was ultimately interrupted when [[Maya Lopez (Earth-616)|Echo]], one of the fallen contestants, was chosen by the Phoenix. Emerging from the ocean floor, Echo absorbed the portions of the Phoenix within Shanna, Zabu and the Red Widow before doing the same to the other participants in the process of fully becoming the Phoenix.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 44}}
