| HistoryText             = Arthrosians are an intelligent species in the Negative Zone. They descended from the Tyannans who set out from the planet [[Tyanna|Tyanna]] to terraform other worlds, planning to use specially engineered spores. After their ship crashed on an uninhabited world of Arthros, they released all their spores and died. The spores grew and produced an intelligent insectoid being, [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]], who found the Tyannan wreckage and learned everything about the Tyannans, especially their genetic engineering technology.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #6}} 

Annihilus fabricated his [[Cosmic Control Rod]] from the spore canisters and used the engine to power it. With this mighty tool and a seemingly endless supply of insectivorids, he embarked on a campaign to rule the Negative Zone.{{r|Fantastic Four Unlimited #3}} It was previously believed that Annihilus was the only Arthrosian, but that has changed with the [[Annihilation Wave (Earth-616)|Annihilation Wave]]. They are an incredibly powerful race, slaughtering a million worlds on the first day of their invasion of the positive universe, otherwise known as Annihilation Day.{{r|Annihilation: Nova Vol 1 4}}

===Biology===
Arthrosians have a chitinous exoskeleton, claws or pincers, mandibles, and eyes that appear to glow. With their claws and depending on the type of Arthrosian their mandibles, they are able to rend flesh and armor (e.g. Nova uniform).{{r|Annihilation: Nova Vol 1 1}} Some of the Arthrosians have other abilities, such as flying via wings or the ability to breath fire.{{r|Annihilation: Super-Skrull Vol 1 1}}

They come in a wide variety of shapes from bipedal semi-humanoids to centaur body types to beetles to wasp body types to centipedes. In a similar manner, they have a wide variety in sizes, from insectoids as tall as humans to insectoids the size of dinosaurs.{{r|Annihilation: Super-Skrull Vol 1 1}}{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 2}}

*'''Superhuman Strength:''': Level of strength varies greatly depending on the type.

*'''Superhuman Speed:''' Certain types of Arthrosian are capable of running and moving at speeds greater than even the finest human athlete.

*'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Arthrosian musculature generates considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of a human being. They can exert themselves at peak capacity for about 24 hours before fatigue begins to impair their bodies.

*'''Superhuman Durability:''' Arthrosian  body is highly resistant to all forms of physical injury. The species has a [[Glossary:C#chitinous|chitinous]] [[Glossary:E#exoskeleton|exoskeleton]] that allows them withstand high caliber bullets, falls from great heights, temperature extremes, pressure extremes 0 up to 1,500 lbs per square inch, and powerful energy blasts without sustaining injury. 

*'''Superhuman Agility:''' Certain types of Arthrosians have agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.
