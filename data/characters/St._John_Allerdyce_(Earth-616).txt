===Early Life===
[[File:St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 141 002.jpg|thumb|left|thumb|125px|St. John Allerdyce]]
'''St. John Allerdyce''' is an [[Australia|Australian]] [[Homo superior|mutant]] born in [[Sydney]]. Though his powers manifested at puberty, he did not make use of them for years save for emergencies. Unable to employ his abilities for profit, Allerdyce drifted from job to job, until he became a journalist for an Australian wire service, covering [[Vietnam]] and [[Indonesia]]. His experiences and travels inspired him to start writing novels (though he also wrote torrid romances). Although Allerdyce's novels were despised by renowned novelists and critics, he found a wide readership throughout the English-speaking world. Eventually, under unrevealed circumstances, Allerdyce met the mutant known [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] and joined her rebranded version of the terrorist [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], under the name of '''Pyro''', the man who controls the living flame.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 10}}

===[[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]===
The Brotherhood made a name for itself by attempting to assassinate anti-mutant presidential candidate [[Robert Kelly (Earth-616)|Senator Robert Kelly]], by infiltrating the [[Pentagon]], only to be thwarted by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and time-traveling [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-811)|Kate Pryde]], who fought to prevent a [[Earth-811|dystopic future]] caused by the terrorist attack. During the battle, Pyro was defeated by a monsoon cast by [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] after she saved him from being killed by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 141|142}} 

Most of the Brotherhood members were sent to prison at [[Ryker's Island]]. After being freed by Mystique and [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], the Brotherhood reassembled and took part in a battle against the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. Pyro was in direct conflict against the [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] and the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], being ultimately knocked out by [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]].{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 10}} Once again arrested, the Brotherhood was transported to the [[Windust Maximum Security Prison]], where Pyro, [[Dominikos Petrakis (Earth-616)|Avalanche]] and [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|the Blob]] were prevented from escaping the authorities by the hero [[Rom (Earth-616)|Rom]], though Mystique, Rogue and [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny]] managed to break free.{{r|Rom Vol 1 31}} 

[[File:St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 177 001.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Pyro, mutant terrorist]]
After Rogue became an X-Man, Mystique decided to attack her former adversary in seek of revenge for stealing her daughter from her. Once again, she reassembled the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, presumably helping her former allies to escape prison. The Brotherhood orchestrated a fake terrorist fire to trick the X-Man [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], which led his steel-form to be severely damaged by Pyro's scorching living flame.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 177}} After attacking [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], the Brotherhood was intercepted by the X-Men, and Pyro once again was defeated by Storm. However, the Brotherhood got off scot-free this time since Mystique traded their freedom for [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]]'s safety.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 178}}

===[[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Federal Agent]]===
Mystique's infiltration in the Pentagon allowed her to maintain the Brotherhood headquartered in its hidden chambers for months and to become familiar with [[Valerie Cooper (Earth-616)|Val Cooper]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 185}} Mystique ultimately exposed her true identity to Cooper and offered the Brotherhood's services to the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities (Earth-616)|Commission on Superhuman Activities]], in exchange for a pardon for their past crimes. Rebranded as [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]], Mystique's group's first assignment under Val Cooper's orders was to capture [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] in order to prove their competence. Though Freedom Force was defeated by the X-Men, with Pyro being personally knocked out by Colossus, Magneto decided to surrender and face a trial.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 199}}{{r|Captain America Vol 1 332}}

[[File:St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 206 001.jpg|thumb|left|130px|As an agent of Freedom Force]]
Pyro served as a sanctioned government agent in several missions, especially in attempts to capture illegal super-humans, such as the X-Men,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 206}} the Avengers,{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 15}}{{r|Avengers Vol 1 32}} and [[Russell Collins (Earth-616)|Rusty Collins]], an assignment that led him to confront [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] and the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] in several different occasions.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 8|9}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 33}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 78|86}} Additionally, when Cooper assigned [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|John Walker]] to step in as the new Captain America for the Commission, the Freedom Force assisted him in his training, when Pyro, Avalanche and the Blob constantly took opportunities to mock him.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 333|334}}

When Destiny foresaw the imminent death of the X-Men,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 223}} Freedom Force attempted to force them to be in custody in order to protect their lives, leading to a brief conflict between the two groups in [[Dallas]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 225}} The two groups soon realized they faced a common threat, the entity known as the [[Adversary (Earth-616)|Adversary]], and joined forces to defeat him, at the cost of the X-Men's lives.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 226|227}} The death of the X-Men had consequences to Freedom Force, as they were approached and attacked by [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] and the New Mutants,{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 65}} and by X-Factor{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 30|31}}, who searched for explanations. 

As an enforcer of the [[Mutant Registration Act]], Pyro intervened in the liberty of several mutants as a member of Freedom Force. The group arrested the [[Alliance of Evil (Earth-616)|Alliance of Evil]]{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 33}}, staged a fake trial to bait the [[Resistants (Earth-616)|Resistants]],{{r|Captain America Vol 1 346}} and got the [[Inferno Babies (Earth-616)|babies]] who had been kidnapped by [[Nanny (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Nanny]] into custody.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 40}} In a minor assignment, Pyro and his teammate Blob, when trying to arrest a mutant named [[Amanda Fallows (Earth-616)|Amanda]], got into conflict with [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 269}}

[[File:St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616) from X-Factor Annual Vol 1 6 001.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Abandoned in the Middle East]]
In one of their most brutal combats, Freedom Force battled the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]] on the [[Muir Island]], a tragedy that cost them the lives of Destiny and [[Louis Hamilton (Earth-616)|Stonewall]], demarking the fall of the group.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 255}} Failing at capturing and recruiting the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 369}}, [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]]{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 86|89}}, and [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Firestar]],{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 82|87}} Freedom Force was ultimately dissolved after Val Cooper was compromised by the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] and Mystique went missing.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 266}} 

Their last and disastrous mission took place in [[Kuwait]] and was led by [[Frank Bohannan (Earth-616)|Crimson Commando]] to liberate [[Reinhold Kurtzmann (Earth-616)|Reinhold Kurtzman]].{{r|New Mutants Annual Vol 1 7}} After being attacked by the [[Desert Sword (Earth-616)|Desert Sword]], Pyro decided to burn Kurtzman alive rather than surrendering him.{{r|X-Factor Annual Vol 1 6}} With Kurtzman dead and the Commando severely injured, Pyro and Blob were abandoned by in the Middle East, surrendering to the Desert Sword.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 15}} They survived by offering their services as bodyguards to the ranking officer who captured them.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 2 2}}

===[[Legacy Virus]]===
Pyro and Blob were freed by [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]] and joined his version of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants out of obligation and gratitude.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 2 2}} This new Brotherhood formed an alliance with [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] and went up against the fledgling mutant team [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]]. Though unsuccessful, most of them, except for [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]], managed to escape.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 6|7}} Sauron returned to their allies as a way to convince the [[X-Patriots (Earth-616)|X-Patriots]] to join the Brotherhood, but their plans were foiled by Val Cooper's new government group, [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]].{{r|X-Factor #82}} In another failed attempt to recruit a mutant, this time the teleporter known as [[Charles Little Sky (Earth-616)|Portal]], the Brotherhood met their defeat at the hands of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Christopher Powell (Earth-616)|Darkhawk]] and [[Sleepwalker (Earth-616)|Sleepwalker]].{{r|Darkhawk Vol 1 19|20}}{{r|Sleepwalker Vol 1 17}}

Soon after, when [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]] offered asylum in [[Avalon (Space Station)|Avalon]] for the Brotherhood's member [[Eileen Harsaw (Earth-616)|Phantazia]] under [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]'s invitation, he mentioned Pyro was not worthy of joining them since he had been "tainted".{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 2}} Soon after, Pyro discovered that he had contracted the deadly [[Legacy Virus]], a terminal mutant illness. At first, he sought help from [[Jonathan Chambers (Earth-616)|Jonathan Chambers]], the millionaire the Empyrean. Upon the revelation that Chambers was using his own powers to drain Pyro's energies, Pyro decided to stay under Chambers' treatment regardless. At the Empyrean's center, Pyro had the opportunity to reencounter his former teammates Avalanche and the Commando, now part of [[Project Wideawake (Earth-616)|Project: Wideawake]] under [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Gyrich]]'s orders.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 2 2}}

[[File:St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 338 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Afflicted by the [[Legacy Virus]]]]
Having a change of mind by wanting to go out in a blaze of glory rather than die a slow death in bed, Pyro committed a spectacular crime scene, that brought him into conflict once again with the vigilante Daredevil. Pyro narrowly escaped being killed in a burning building at the end of this encounter.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 355}} With his powers immensely out of control, his body intensely harmed by his own flames and his mind damaged by his disease, Pyro accidentally set a church on fire when talking to a priest. With the intervention of the X-Men, he was restrained but rescued by Avalanche before he could be apprehended, presumably under Mystique's orders.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 338}} Pyro was then charged by Mystique of preventing the assassination of her son, the politician [[Graydon Creed (Earth-616)|Graydon Creed]], but he failed when he was captured by X-Factor, who had believed him to be the potential murderer.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 129|130}}

As his condition worsened, Pyro robbed a [[New York City]] bank to acquire payment for a scientist who claimed to be able of removing his mutant genes. In the course of the robbery, Pyro was shot several times in his abdomen. He was taken to a nearby hospital where [[Cecilia Reyes (Earth-616)|Dr. Cecilia Reyes]], a mutant surgeon who had recently joined the X-Men, operated on him. Shortly afterwards, Pyro tricked Dr. Reyes into loosening his bonds, allowing him to escape.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 351}}

[[File:Robert Kelly (Earth-616) and St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616) from Cable Vol 1 87 001.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The death of Pyro]]
Pyro then led a group of mutants to obtain a cure for the Legacy Virus by acquiring High Evolutionary's Isotope E, under the instructions of Exodus and the [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]]. As they failed, Exodus, who never intended to help them at all, abandoned them in the [[Savage Land]].{{r|Quicksilver Vol 1 6|9}} Not long after, Pyro returned to the United States by unknown means as he was chased across Nebraska by the X-Men's rogue sentient [[Cerebro (Founder) (Earth-616)|Cerebro]]. Despite the X-Men's attempts to stop him, as they misunderstood his predicament, he managed to destroy the Cerebro unit. He finally collapsed, exhausted, after claiming to be working with Charles Xavier. [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] took him into custody.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #362}}

Pyro then surreptitiously attended a rally held by presidential candidate Senator Robert Kelly. When his former teammates in the Brotherhood tried to assassinate the politician, Pyro warned the X-Men and even killed [[Kevin Tremain (Earth-616)|Post]] to save Kelly's life. Severely weakened by the strain, Pyro pleaded with Kelly to stop the hatred between humans and mutants, tragically dying in Kelly's arms as he succumbed to the Legacy Virus.{{r|Cable Vol 1 87}}

===Return from Death===
Briefly resurrected by [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]], Pyro joined her army of revived mutants during the foundation of [[Necrosha]]. Alongside [[Ray Carter (Earth-616)|Berzerker]], he invaded [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] and fought [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]].{{r|X-Necrosha Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Force Vol 3 21}} Unexplainably, Pyro was seen alive when he, Sauron and [[Michael Suggs (Earth-616)|Hairbag]] were attacked and captured by [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|William Stryker]]. Pyro, as many other mutants, was brainwashed by [[Marvin Flumm (Earth-616)|Mentallo]], but was eventually freed due to the efforts of [[Weapon X-Force (Earth-616)|Weapon X-Force]].{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 24|25}} Later, after the apparent death of the X-Men, he joined [[Joseph (Earth-616)|Joseph]]'s new Brotherhood, who attacked a military base in [[Transia]]. The Brotherhood was confronted by the X-Men, with Pyro being knocked out by [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 16}} A short time later, Pyro presumably met his demise, but the details that led to his death are unknown.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 1}}

===[[Marauders (Pryde) (Earth-616)|Marauder]]===
When mutantkind relocated to the mutant island-nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], Charles Xavier developed a process to allow [[Resurrection Protocols|mutant resurrection]]. Pyro was one of the first mutants to be brought back to life, being part of the early experimentations with the protocols. Upon learning he served as a guinea pig, he planned to steal a boat and cause trouble. He inadvertently infiltrated [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kate Pryde]]'s ship and fell asleep, which caused him to be drafted into the new [[Marauders (Pryde) (Earth-616)|Marauders]] by [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]]'s invitation. Pyro assisted the Marauders in defending a gate to Krakoa from a group of Russian soldiers and teamed up with [[Lockheed (Earth-616)|Lockheed]] to defeat the attackers.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 1}}

[[File:St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616) from Marauders Vol 1 2 001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Getting his tattoo]]
The Marauders became a marine rescue force that retrieved mutants who could not access Krakoa by themselves, performing several operations all over the globe. After defeating [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc the Leaper]] and hijacking one of the [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Black King]]'s ships, the team found themselves meeting up with [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] in [[Taipei]], where they were informed about Xavier's murder on Krakoa. Afflicted by the revelation, Kate Pryde took the Marauders to a nearby tattoo shop, where Pyro got a big black skull tattooed all over his face, a reference to the Marauders' pirate flag. In the following day, [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], the White Queen of [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Trading]], presented the Marauders with a gigantic ship, the [[Marauder (Vehicle)|Marauder]], much to Pyro's excitement.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 2}}

As the Hellfire Trading Company's pirates, the Marauders kept their good work of rescuing mutant refugees in [[Brazil]] and in [[Madripoor]], where they were met by the [[Homines Verendi (Earth-616)|Homines Verendi]]'s agents, [[Josh Glenn (Earth-616)|Hate-Monger]], [[Carl Denti (Earth-616)|X-Cutioner]] and a microscopic [[Darren Cross (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]], who secretly infiltrated Pyro's body in order to invade Krakoa.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 4|5}} However, before Pyro could arrive at Krakoa, Yellowjacket was caught in a mental trap planned by the White Queen and Bishop, forcing him to leave Pyro's organism. Later, Pyro threatened the Inner Circle of the Verendi with the White Queen's help.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 9}} The Marauders struck back by ravaging the Verendi's forces in Madripoor.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 10}} After Kate Pryde's funeral and resurrection,{{r|Marauders Vol 1 12}} Pyro was seen with the X-Men at the end of the [[X of Swords]] tournament.{{r|X of Swords: Destruction Vol 1 1}}

As the Marauders planned to conquer territory and influence in Madripoor to fend off the Verendi, Pyro, [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] and Bishop built and bought several facilities in [[Lowtown (Madripoor)|Lowtown]], starting with the [[Princess Bar]], which led them to fight the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]]{{r|Marauders Vol 1 18}} and Madripoor's navy.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 19}} When Storm left the Marauders, on the [[Hellfire Gala]]'s eve, Pyro expressed his admiration for her and the Marauders' crew.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 20}} During the Gala event, Pyro was saluted by the White Queen alongside other members of the Hellfire Trading Company for their good work for Krakoa's best interests.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 21}}

| Powers                  = Pyro is a [[Pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] [[Homo superior|mutant]] with the ability to control fire:
* '''Fire Manipulation:''' Pyro has the ability to cause any fire to grow in size and intensity and to take any form he desire. He usually refers to his fire creations as "the living flame", which he had usually shown to shape as gigantic claws, birds or golems.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 141}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 142}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 226}} The size, power, and intensity of the fire-beings Pyro created were limited only by the extent of his imagination, the degree of his concentration and his force of will. He has shown the ability to use his flames to elevate Colossus's steel form's temperature near its melting point.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 177}} Pyro can also manipulate intense heat blasts derived from microwaves, even though they are not necessarily ignited, such as those generated by [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Firestar]].{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 85}} <!-- 

PLAGIARISM - DIRECT TRANSCRIPTION FROM THE OFFICIAL HANDBOOK OF THE MARVEL UNIVERSE DELUXE EDITION #10: The degree of concentration required is directly proportional to the size, power, and heat intensity of the flame-being. Pyro has to be able to see a flame in order to take control of it; in practical terms, the flame had to be within a 100-yard radius of him. Pyro couldn't affect flames that were not within his vicinity but which he saw via television. Once having established control over a fire, he could continue to control it after it had left his range of sight, but only with a degree of difficulty that increased as the distance between himself and the flame-being increased. Pyro could, for example, create a fiery "bird" and command it to fly beyond the range of his sight, but if it then collided with a wall or if his concentration was in the least diminished, the "bird" would revert to being ordinary fire. Any of Pyro's fiery creations would immediately turn to ordinary, amorphous fire if he turned his interest from them.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 10}}

[[File:St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 142 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Pyro's living flame]]
* '''Fire Solidification:''' Pyro's fiery creations can manifest a high level of "solidity", differently from an ordinary fire, since his creations have been shown to be able to grasp his enemies for instance.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 142}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 177}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 362}}
* '''Fire Invulnerability:''' Pyro is resistant to any fire he had placed under his control. He has been shown to absorb and redirect flames, commanding them to slide across his skin and even reach his heart.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 206}} However, he could be harmed, just as any ordinary human would be, by any fire that he did not mentally control.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 10}}

| Weaknesses              = * Although able to control any fire within his vicinity, Pyro is unable to generate and project fire himself without an external source.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 226}} After joining the [[Marauders (Pryde) (Earth-616)|Marauders]], Pyro often teams up with his teammate [[Lockheed (Earth-616)|Lockheed]], who has the ability to breathe fire, fueling Pyro's living flame.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 1}}
* Pyro's influence on flames can be counterattacked in different ways. When targetted by [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]]'s intense monsoons, he lost the capacity to sustain his fire.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 142}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 178}} In case the source of his fire is extinguished, he will not be able to maintain the fire either. When the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] blocked his flamethrowers, his living flame was destroyed.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 312}}
* Pyro could be harmed by any fire that he did not mentally control. Pyro has to be able to see a flame in order to take control of it; in practical terms, the flame has to be within a 100-yard radius of him. Pyro cannot affect flames that he sees on a screen but which are not within this radius for instance. Any of Pyro's fiery creations will immediately revert to ordinary flame if he loses his interest in it.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 10}}

| Equipment               = Since Pyro is unable to create fire himself, he wears a kerosene-based flame-thrower on his costume,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 142}} which could project a stream of flame up to 25 feet away, so that he could use it to start a fire which he could then manipulate. He also wore a specially insulated costume that afforded him a certain degree of protection against fires he did not control.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 10}}
