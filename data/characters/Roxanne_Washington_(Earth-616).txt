===Origin===
Roxanne Washington was born into hip-hop "royalty" as the daughter of Roy "Daddy Libido" Washington and Angel "Sexy Mutha" Depres. Having appeared in her parents' rap videos from a young age, Washington was often targeted by would-be kidnappers and assassins.{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}}

Destined to follow in her parents' footsteps, Washington turned her back on that life and enrolled as a student at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] under the tutelage of [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]]. Washington was more concerned with improving herself rather than the escalating human/[[Homo superior|mutant]] situation. Her school record showed her to be a good and attentive student with a strong sense of responsibility.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 171}} 

===The Chevaliers===
As a member of Gambit's squad, the [[Chevaliers (Earth-616)|Chevaliers]], Washington was forced to deal with the arrival of newcomer [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Foxx]]'s infatuation with her teacher. Until Foxx was revealed to be the shapeshifting Mystique, Bling! also nursed an attraction towards the villain's disguise.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #171|174}}

Bling! retained her powers after [[Decimation|M-Day]]. She helped [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]]'s squad during the [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E (Earth-616)|Sentinels]]' arrival and [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]]'s return due to lack of members, [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]]' de-powerment, [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s frequent disappearances, and Gambit's betrayal.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #185|186}}

Roxy refused [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|Prodigy]] and [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge's]] offer to join their new team. Ever since the events of [[M-Day]] she believed "anyone who wants to be an X-Man has a serious death wish."{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 35}}

Bling! was captured by [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]] in [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]], alongside most of the other students.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #37|38}}

===Manifest Destiny===
When the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] moved to [[San Francisco]] and set up a new base in [[California (State)|California]], Bling! followed. She helped to control the riot surrounding the [[Proposition X]], legislation which attempted to limit mutant reproduction, pushed by [[Simon Trask (Earth-616)|Simon Trask]] and his anti-mutant group, the Humanity Now! Coalition. During the final fight on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], Bling! teamed up with [[Joanna Cargill (Earth-616)|Frenzy]] and [[Nekra Sinclair (Earth-616)|Nekra]] in taking on [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]].{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Exodus #1}}

===Nation X===
After an attack by [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]], everybody living on Utopia was warned to stay close together and report anything out of the ordinary. Roxy was greeted by Emplate, who claimed dinner to be served. She was rescued by recently returned [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] using [[Hope Abbott (Earth-616)|Trance]]'s power.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #228|229}}

===Schism & Jean Grey School===
Eventually Roxanne and a host of other mutants on Utopia chose to split from [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]'s group to side with Logan's X-faction instead during the [[Schism (Event)|Schism]]. Logan's group became a part of the new [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 9}} Bling, while still a student, would come to terms with a number of personal issues: her lesbianism when she tries to consort with [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]]; battling an old X-Foes sibling [[Arkea (Earth-616)|Arkea]];{{r|X-Men Vol 4 3}} joining a teen strike force against evil alternate universe doppelgangers aligned with the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]];{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 12}} dealing with a future [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] during the [[Battle of the Atom]] and helping [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]] babysit and retrieve her kidnapped adopted child [[Shogo Lee (Earth-616)|Shogo]].{{r|X-Men Vol 4 6}}

===Generation X===
Roxanne was assigned to the Real World Practical Applications class.{{r|Generation X Vol 2 2}} She was disappointed that she would never be a part of the X-Men despite having "a similar power set to Emma Frost."{{r|Generation X Vol 2 8}} This caused her to seek out [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]], hoping to change classes so that she could be put on the path to being part of the official X-Men.{{r|Generation X Vol 2 3}} She began attending therapy sessions with [[Paige Guthrie]] to help deal with her insecurities.{{r|Generation X Vol 2 8}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Roxanne was one of the many mutants that opposed the crazed [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] from remaking the world in his image. When X-Man realized that his vision of the world would never come about with the X-Men around, X-Man made his enemies vanish in an instant, including Roxanne.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 #9|10}}

===Age of X-Man===
Roxy and the others were transported to another [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|plane of existence]] by X-Man created in an attempt at a utopia where they and all other mutants would be at peace, altering their memories so they wouldn't resist.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha #1}}

Bling! was one of the students who were part of the Medical Division at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Summers Institute for Higher Learning]]. In the lunch room, she sat at the table behind [[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob Herman]] and overheard the stories that [[Iara Dos Santos (Earth-616)|Shark-Girl]] told about Glob writing [[X-Men Disassembled|fan fiction]] about all of them being members of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and having adventures and battling against bad guys. As the gang was leaving, Bling! had a small talk with [[Victor Borkowski (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Anole]], that they already had plans, so he couldn't go with the others to the library to study.<!-- {{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen #1}} -->

[[Megan Gwynn (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Pixie]] and [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]] later witnessed Roxy being apprehended by [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Clerk Blob]] after she came out of a burning house. Blob said to her that it was a shame that she was flushing her life away after Roxy was yelling that [[Department X (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Department X]] was a fascist organization who was trying to suppress the truth. She said she was going to open the eyes of everyone to the lie. Blob then told her to quiet her mouth as she was heading towards her second mindwipe.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen #1}}

While not seen, Roxy presumably was allowed to return to the real world after X-Man chose to allow the mutants he trapped in his reality to leave.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega #1}}

===Fallen Angels===
Bling! was one of the many mutants that joined the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] upon its creation. She was initially distrustful of the whole objective of Krakoa and for that reason was recruited by [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] to join her team. This group of mutants also involved [[Kwannon (Earth-616)|Psylocke]], [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], and [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]].{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 5}}

| Powers                  = Bling! is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] who displayed the following powers:
*'''Diamond Form:''' Bling!'s bone marrow is able to produce diamond shards of varying quality, giving her skin and physicality a crystalline appearance.
**'''''Diamond Shards:''''' She is able to manipulate the shape and quality of diamonds that protrude from her body, which are formed by her bone marrow, and expel them from her body at high speeds.
**'''''Superhuman Strength:''''' It can be theorized her crystal form gives her incredible strength; her upper scale remains undetermined, but she's strong enough to tear through the triple reinforced steel doors of the Danger Room.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 #5}}
**'''''Superhuman Durability:''''' Her crystalline body grants her superhuman durability.

She was deemed a [[:Category:Low Threats|Low Threat]] by the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]].{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}}
| Abilities               = *'''Genius Intelligence''': Bling! possesses a genius intelligence that allows her to build and hack technology.
*'''Master Engineer''': She is an excellent engineer and mechanic capable of building advanced machinery and technology. One such example: the special pendant she created for [[Shogo Lee (Earth-616)|Shogo]] which was capable of employing a protective bubble around the child when he's in danger and was based off of [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]]'s mutant powers.
*'''Expert Businesswoman''': Among [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]]'s A.P. Economics class "best available candidates", Roxy was recruited for his new board at Worthington Industries. Additional members included [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]], [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]], and Armor. She along with her classmates lead the board for sometime.
