| History                 = Reilly Marshall was an Ex-[[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] agent assigned to the [[United Nations Security Council (Earth-616)|U.N. Security Council]]. He posed  as part of the ambassador entourage invited to [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Xavier]]'s [[Jerusalem Habitat]]. He along with the other member's were greeted by the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] and [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] who took over the task of giving the ambassadors a tour through the various biomes of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].

As they came to the end of the tour, [[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]] read the minds of the delegates and conveyed to Magneto that they were not ambassadors at all but were sent there to spy on the [[Homo superior|mutants]] to determine the validity of their new found nation-state and its relationship to humanity. However, she was only able to get a partial read off of Marshall due to his training in telepathic defenses but realized he was hiding a weapon on him.

Magneto used his abilities to hold Marshall in midair due to the iron content in his blood and magnetically dissembled his gun into a bunch of smaller pieces making it unusable. Marshall explained that he was carrying for his own protection, but Magneto perpetuated that the [[Homo sapiens|humans]] should accept the gifts that were being offered to them because they were now being watched over by their new gods.{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}}
