===Origins===
One of the noblest and most tormented cosmic entities in the universe, the Silver Surfer treasures freedom above all else, but has often sacrificed his liberty for the greater good. He was born Norrin Radd on the planet [[Zenn-La]], part of an extremely long-lived and technologically advanced humanoid race which had created a worldwide utopia devoid of crime, disease, hunger, poverty, and want of any kind. His father named him after revered scientist [[Norrin Konn (Earth-616)|Norrin Konn]], the man responsible for raising Zenn-La from barbarism to utopia.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 91}} Norrin Radd's mother [[Elmar Radd (Earth-616)|Elmar]], ill-suited to this stifling environment, eventually killed herself.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 100}} Urged on by his atypically ambitious father [[Jartran Radd (Earth-616)|Jartran]], Norrin was raised as a grimly intellectual youth, encouraged to seek knowledge, advancement and achievement rather than the aimless hedonism which had come to dominate Zenn-Lavian society; however, a disgraced Jartran would later commit suicide himself after he was accused of idea theft{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 50}} (though not before he had taken a new lover and fathered another son, [[Fennan Radd (Earth-616)|Fennan]], unknown to Norrin).{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 101}} Despite his lifelong lover [[Shalla-Bal (Construct) (Earth-616)|Shalla-Bal]], Norrin grew into a restless soul who longed for challenge and struggle, immersing himself in histories of Zenn-La's adventurous ancient past.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 1}}

Norrin's life changed forever when a menacing alien spacecraft pierced Zenn-La's long-neglected defense systems. Convincing a Council of Scientists member to provide him with a spaceship, Radd soon confronted the invader, [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]], who intended to consume Zenn-La; Radd offered to become his herald and seek out new worlds for him to sate his hunger in exchange for Galactus sparing Zenn-La. Galactus agreed, transforming Radd into a silver-skinned, cosmic-powered super-being{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 1}} patterned after an adolescent fantasy plucked from Norrin's memories.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 49}} Known thereafter as the Silver Surfer because of the silvery flying board he rode, Radd departed Zenn-La with Galactus.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 1}}

===Herald of Galactus===
The Surfer served Galactus well for several decades{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 49}} (likely almost 100 years),{{r|Silver Surfer: Homecoming Vol 1 1}} enjoying exploring the wonders of the universe; however, it became increasingly difficult for Radd to find energy-rich worlds devoid of sentient life. The destruction of the first inhabited planet he offered to Galactus almost drove Norrin insane, forcing Galactus to alter the mind of his herald, submerging Radd's emotions and repressing past memories.{{r|Silver Surfer Annual Vol 2 1}} As a result, the Surfer became much more willing to lead Galactus to inhabited worlds, such as Massikron, Elynore-143, Draven-Barr,{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}} and eventually [[Earth]]. 

At some point during his servitude to the Devourer of Worlds, the Silver Surfer encountered the artificial planet [[Klyntar (Location)|Klyntar]] and was attacked by its constituent symbiotes, which attempted to imprison him at its core; though he managed to break free and escape.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}} At some point after this he sacrificed Joot - one of the worlds conquered by the [[Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)|Symbiote Imperium]] - to Galactus, further exacerbating the symbiotes' instinctual hatred for him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 430|431}}

===New Home===
Locating Earth despite [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu the Watcher]]'s covert attempts to ward him off, the Surfer caused widespread panic and fought the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|Fantastic Four #48}} During this conflict, the Surfer met blind sculptress [[Alicia Masters (Earth-616)|Alicia Masters]], who sensed his inner nobility and pleaded with him to spare humanity. His long-dormant emotions stirred by Alicia's beauty and spirit, the Surfer turned on Galactus{{r|Fantastic Four #49}} and helped fight him off long enough for Uatu and the Fantastic Four to secure the [[Ultimate Nullifier (Weapon)|Ultimate Nullifier]], a cosmic doomsday weapon which forced Galactus to withdraw; however, Galactus punished the Surfer by trapping him on Earth, erecting a cosmic energy barrier around the planet that was uniquely attuned to the Surfer.{{r|Fantastic Four #50}}

The Surfer became a melancholy global wanderer, trying to adjust to his new home and understand its people. After a pointless skirmish with Alicia's jealous boyfriend the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]],{{r|Fantastic Four #55}} the Surfer was befriended and betrayed by Latverian tyrant [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], who imprisoned Radd and stole the Surfer's power for himself,{{r|Fantastic Four #57}} but Doom lost his new might when he collided with a barrier created by Galactus, and the Surfer's powers were restored.{{r|Fantastic Four #60}}

Increasingly pessimistic about humanity, the Surfer tried to befriend fellow outcast the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], but the man-monster's violent temper drove him away. Next, the Surfer took pity on the [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]]'s abandoned sentient computer [[Quasi-Motivational Destruct Organism (Earth-616)|Quasimodo]] and gave it humanoid form, but he was forced to petrify his new creation after it proved to be criminally insane. Convinced by now that humanity was a savage race that could only survive and evolve if the planet were united against a common foe, the Surfer decided to become that foe; he terrorized the world with his cosmic powers until the U.S. military struck him down with an experimental power-draining "Sonic Shark" missile based on technology developed by the Fantastic Four's [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]]. Humbled by the incident and shown the error of his ways by the FF, the Surfer resumed his peaceful wanderings. His abilities were diminished, though they gradually returned to their original power-levels.

Aided by the Fantastic Four, the Surfer resisted attempts by Galactus to regain his services; he also faced foes such as the alien [[Badoon]], the [[Demons|demonic]] [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] (who became obsessed with breaking the Surfer's spirit), [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] trickster god [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] (who manipulated the Surfer into battling his brother [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]), the alternate-future [[Rakkhal (Earth-6966)|Overlord]], mad scientist [[Ludwig von Frankenstein (Earth-616)|Ludwig von Frankenstein]], the ghostly [[Joost van Straaten (Earth-616)|Flying Dutchman]], rogue Zenn-Lavian scientist [[Yarro Gort (Earth-616)|Yarro Gort]] (who coveted Shalla-Bal for himself and died trying to destroy the Surfer), the occultist [[Nigel Carruthers (Earth-616)|Warlock Prime]], the monstrous [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Abomination]],{{r|Silver Surfer #12}} and the robotic [[Doomsday Man (Earth-616)|Doomsday Man]].{{r|Silver Surfer #13}} One of the Surfer's few true friends during these early adventures was physicist [[Alvin Bernard Harper (Earth-616)|Al B. Harper]], who sacrificed his life to help the Surfer save the world from the enigmatic [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]]; the Surfer lit an eternal flame at Harper's grave in memory of his heroism. Several times during this period, the Surfer was briefly reunited with Shalla-Bal, who was used as an unwilling pawn against the Surfer by foes such as Mephisto{{r|Silver Surfer #16|17}} and Yarro Gort; but circumstances always forced the lovers apart, sending Shalla-Bal home each time. Increasingly frustrated by his situation and disgusted by man's inhumanity to man, the Surfer - secretly influenced by [[Psycho-Man (Earth-616)|Psycho-Man]] - became more hostile, battling [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]],{{r|Silver Surfer #14}} [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]],{{r|Silver Surfer #15}} [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]{{r|Silver Surfer #16|17}} and the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]]{{r|Silver Surfer #18}} in a series of misunderstandings and misadventures; but when Doctor Doom temporarily usurped the power of Galactus, the Surfer helped defeat the villain.{{r|Fantastic Four #57|60}}

[[File:Annihilation Silver Surfer Vol 1 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Silver Surfer]]
===The Defenders===
The Surfer formed a temporary alliance with the Hulk and [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] to oppose a new weather technology that threatened to destroy the world; these "[[Titans Three (Earth-616)|Titans Three]]" completed their mission despite the misguided interference of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], and even toppled a minor hostile dictator along the way. Namor, Hulk and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] soon formed a more enduring heroic alliance as the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]], saving the world from [[Yandroth (Earth-616)|Yandroth]]; they tried to recruit the Surfer for their first mission, but he was recovering from a collision with Galactus' barrier at the time. After aiding Thor against Loki's minion [[Durok (Earth-616)|Durok the Demolisher]], the Surfer helped the FF defeat Galactus' latest herald, the [[Air-Walker (Automaton) (Earth-616)|Air-Walker android]], and the FF, in turn, protected the Surfer by trapping Galactus in the [[Negative Zone]]. The Surfer soon fell under the mental sway of [[Calizuma (Earth-616)|Calizuma]] and his [[Warrior Wizards (Earth-616)|Warrior Wizards]], agents of the demonic [[Undying Ones]]; freed from their influence by the Defenders, the Surfer helped defeat the wizards and became one of the Defenders' earliest recruits, aiding the team against foes such as the [[Nameless One (Undying Ones Leader) (Earth-616)|Nameless One]], [[Attuma (Earth-616)|Attuma]] and the [[Ivan Kragoff (Earth-616)|Red Ghost]]. At one point, a quest to restore the petrified [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight (Dane Whitman)]] led the Defenders into a conflict with the Avengers orchestrated by Loki and [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]]. In the end, the villains were defeated and the two super-teams parted as friends, though the restless Surfer soon left the active Defenders ranks.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 1|11}} {{r|Avengers/Defenders War}}

Tricked into helping Doctor Doom create the deadly [[Doomsman II (Earth-616)|Doomsman android]], the Surfer helped the FF neutralize this menace,{{r|Fantastic Four #155|157}} then clashed with the vampire lord [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]]. Later, the Surfer was present at an Avengers-Defenders gathering, and was ineffectually attacked by mind-controlled heroine [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jewel (Jessica Jones)]]. After another clash with the Hulk, the Surfer aided the Defenders against the demonic [[Six-Fingered Hand (Earth-616)|Six-Fingered Hand]] and their hellish masters, including Mephisto. After aiding the Avengers against the [[Owen Reece (Earth-616)|Molecule Man]], declining an offer of Avengers membership, attending the funeral of seemingly deceased Defenders teammates [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]] and [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]], and participating in another Avengers-Defenders clash orchestrated by alien menaces [[Nebulon (Earth-616)|Nebulon]] and [[Supernalia (Earth-616)|Supernalia]], the Surfer finally pierced Galactus' barrier with the aid of Reed Richards and escaped Earth; but he discovered Zenn-La had been devastated by a vengeful Galactus, barely capable of supporting life. Worse yet, Shalla-Bal had been abducted back to Earth by Mephisto. Though it meant trapping himself on Earth again (since Reed's escape method would work only once), the Surfer returned to Earth and defeated Mephisto, who sent Shalla-Bal back to Zenn-La, though not before the Surfer endowed her with a portion of his cosmic power which she used to revitalize their ravaged home-world.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 2 #1}}

[[File:Norrin Radd (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 430 0001.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Silver Surfer became the [[Carnage Cosmic]] when he was briefly possessed by the Carnage Symbiote{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #430}}]]

The Surfer helped the Defenders liberate the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Squadron Supreme]]'s alternate Earth ([[Earth-712|Earth-S]]) from the control of the demonic [[Null the Living Darkness (Earth-616)|Null the Living Darkness]], then celebrated the Hulk's brief public acceptance after gaining Bruce Banner's intellect; but the Surfer and his fellow senior Defenders Hulk, Namor and Strange were hoaxed into disbanding after the alien [[Living Tribunal (Multiverse)|Tribunal]] convinced them their continued teamwork was fated to cause Earth's doom. The Surfer, meanwhile, helped the Fantastic Four defeat the cosmic-powered Tyros (formerly Galactus' herald [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax]]) and locate a missing Reed Richards, helped Earth's heroes neutralize the threat of the near-omnipotent [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]], and teamed with the Molecule Man to undo much of the damage done to Earth by the Beyonder.

===End Of Exile===
Piercing Galactus' barrier again (this time by using the Thing's simple suggestion of trying to pass through it without his surfboard),{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 1}} the Surfer made peace with Galactus by rescuing his current herald [[Frankie Raye (Earth-616)|Nova (Frankie Raye)]] from the [[Skrulls]], after which Galactus finally ended the Surfer's long exile after almost ten years.{{r|Silver Surfer: Homecoming Vol 1 1}} Radd revisited his home-world, but Shalla-Bal had become empress of the rejuvenated Zenn-La and was not free to renew their romance. The Surfer became embroiled in fresh hostilities between the interstellar [[Kree]] and Skrull empires, and intervened in a series of plots by the [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elders of the Universe]], who planned to destroy Galactus - and the universe with him - in order to become the supreme powers of a new universe. The Surfer thwarted the Elders with the aid of his new love interest [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]], the Earth-born cosmic heroine also known as the Celestial Madonna, but she seemingly died in the process; though she would later return, she never fully renewed her romance with the Surfer. Romantic sparks developed between Nova and the Surfer, whose influence gradually led Nova to question the morality of her role as a herald. Galactus finally replaced her with the far more ruthless [[Morg (Earth-616)|Morg]], who killed Nova during a conflict with the Surfer and most of the other ex-heralds.

The Surfer has repeatedly battled space-born menaces such as [[Reptyl (Earth-616)|Reptyl]], [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego the Living Planet]], [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]], [[M'Nai (Earth-616)|Midnight Sun]], [[Nebula (Earth-616)|Nebula]], Galactus' dark counterpart [[Tyrant (Earth-616)|Tyrant]]-and, perhaps most notably, [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]], a death-worshiping rogue [[Eternals (Homo immortalis)|Eternal]] who wiped out half the life in the universe using the omnipotent [[Infinity Gauntlet (Item)|Infinity Gauntlet]] before the Surfer teamed with a reborn [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]] and many other heroes to seize and dismantle the gauntlet after undoing its effects. The Surfer has been allied with cosmic adventurers such as [[Jonathan Hart (Earth-616)|Jack of Hearts]], [[Ganymede (Alien) (Earth-616)|Ganymede]], [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Genis-Vell]] and Warlock's [[Infinity Watch (Earth-616)|Infinity Watch]], who helped the Surfer restore Shalla-Bal to life after she sacrificed herself to save Zenn-La from the supremely powerful [[Great One (Earth-616)|Great One]]. The Surfer also partnered with [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]], [[Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616)|Beta Ray Bill]], [[Morfex (Earth-616)|Morfex]] and [[Xenith (Earth-616)|Xenith]] to form the short-lived [[Star Masters (Earth-616)|Star Masters]] team, and began participating in occasional Defenders reunions, the Tribunal's hoax having been exposed. 

During his travels, the Surfer also met his long-lost brother [[Fennan Radd (Earth-616)|Fennan]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 100}} However, Zenn-La and its people later seemingly vanished, and the Surfer came to discover that his home-world had been destroyed in the 1940s by the mysterious, all-powerful entity known as the [[Other (Alien Entity) (Earth-616)|Other]]. The Zenn-Lavian world and people he had encountered since his leaving the service of Galactus were "re-creations" of the originals. Galactus, after finding Zenn-La utterly decimated by the Other, recreated the planet and its inhabitants in every detail so when the Surfer left his service (as he knew he one day would) he would have a home to return to. So accurate was this new Zenn-La that it convinced not only the Surfer over the years but also convinced the Skrulls, Kree, the demonic Mephisto and even the [[Celestials]]. Why the "new" Zenn-La dissolved was never made entirely clear but it was likely the result of Galactus' temporary absence from the universe due to being caught in the Ultimate Nullifier's blast.{{r|{{cl|Silver Surfer Vol 3 130}}-[[Silver Surfer Vol 3 136|136]]}}

Shortly before his encounter with the Other, the Surfer lost his capacity for emotion once again when discovering the truth about the false Zenn-La{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 122}} placed emotional blocks in his mind to protect him from his grief. The Surfer then returned to Earth, eventually regaining his full range of emotions during the time travel adventure in which he learned the full truth about Zenn-La and encountered the Other, after which he began a romance with [[Alicia Masters (Earth-616)|Alicia Masters]]. They ultimately parted as friends after many adventures together, one of which pitted them against Galactus' new herald [[Red Shift (Earth-616)|Red Shift]] and led to the temporary destruction of Galactus himself.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 123|146}}{{r|{{cl|Galactus the Devourer Vol 1 1}}-[[Galactus the Devourer Vol 1 6|6]]}}

===[[Order|The Order]]===
When a [[Gaea (Earth-616)|Gaea]]-powered curse from a dying Yandroth mystically forced Surfer, Namor, Hulk and Strange to assemble in response to any and all threats to the Earth, the ongoing stress of this situation coupled with the subtle emotional influence of the curse itself gradually drove the four senior Defenders mad, and they attempted to rule the world as the Order in the belief that this was the most efficient way to protect the planet. Their fellow Defenders [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]], [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]], [[Samantha Parrington (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] and [[Clea (Earth-616)|Clea]] teamed with other heroes - including [[Ardina (Earth-616)|Ardina]], a cosmic-powered woman whom they mystically created from a portion of the Surfer's own energy - to oppose the Order and return them to their senses, just in time to prevent the curse from rendering a resurrected Yandroth all-powerful and almighty.{{r|{{cl|The Order Vol 1 1}}-[[The Order Vol 1 6|6]]}}

===Communion & Revelation===
The Surfer believed he was recruited by a being named [[Ayaman (Earth-616)|Ayaman]] on behalf of a council of alien species who carried on the work of the [[Annunaki (Aliens)|Annunaki]] and was given command over a shipped called the [[Great Ark]] which was designed to hold all of the remaining life on [[Earth]] after a supposedly inevitable apocalypse. The surfer began to gather young children from across the planet who were intelligent and gifted with special and precocious talents such as music and art. An alien named [[Amnel (Earth-616)|Amnel]] helped the Surfer to care for and 'evolve' the children so they would develop special powers as well as becoming more connected and aware of the universe. Not all of the children were easily pacified to their new circumstances and two, [[Gabe Acheron (Earth-616)|Gabe Acheron]] and [[Ellie Waters (Earth-616)|Ellie Waters]] wanted to return home so the Surfer communed with the Singularity and learned that as Ellie was 'protected' she could be returned home to her mother [[Denise Waters (Earth-616)|Denise Waters]]{{r|{{cl|Silver Surfer Vol 5 1}}-[[Silver Surfer Vol 5 6|6]]}}

The Surfer revealed he had been set on this course of action because a destructive machine, [[Marduk (Entity) (Earth-616)|Marduk]] was on its way to Earth to destroy civilization so humanity did not destroy themselves or their planet. Marduk was programmed to preserve life at all costs even if that meant drowning the planet and sending civilization crashing down to start all over again. As Marduk could not be reasoned with or stopped the children had been gathered so that they could be placed back on Earth after Marduk was finished and lead humanity to rise back up without endangering themselves or their world so Marduk would never have to come again.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 5 7}}

The Surfer would then come to learn that it was Marduk he had been truly serving, although [[Ayaman (Earth-616)|Ayaman]] and Singularity had chosen the Surfer for this task hoping he would be able to prevent Marduk from destroying the Earth. The Surfer also learned that Marduk was a thought form, having been brought into reality by the imaginations of man and not by the [[Annunaki (Aliens)|Annunaki]]. As a thought form, Marduk was created by the imaginations of mankind. Marduk attempted to use the Surfer's ship to destroy the Earth by crashing it into the planet at its weakest point, the Surfer attempted to heal the planet by merging himself with its core but was unable. Marduk was not defeated until [[Ellie Waters (Earth-616)|Ellie Waters]] awakened to her true potential and willed it out of existence when she remade the Earth. It is unclear whether the Surfer remembered these events occurring after they were reset.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 5 8|14}}

===In Thy Name===
While travelling through space the Surfer encountered the [[Ama Collective (Earth-616)|Ama Collective]], a seemingly utopian federation of worlds who he quickly learned were far from utopian as they were in truth, an arrogant people who outlawed religion and imposed their will and way of life on others.{{r|{{cl|Silver Surfer: In Thy Name Vol 1 1}}-[[Silver Surfer: In Thy Name Vol 1 2|2]]}} The Surfer inadvertently inspired one of the Collectives worlds to embrace their religion once again, and after insulting the Collectives Empress they had him crucified on the planet [[Brekknis]] as a warning to the [[Brekk]]. 

The Surfer did not want the Brekk to go to war in his name but they were enraged by the insult the Ama had shown to a being they viewed as their Savior. The Surfer then learned that the Ama had in fact set all of this up to give themselves an excuse to manipulate the Brekk into going to war with them so they could annihilate them.{{r|Silver Surfer: In Thy Name Vol 1 3}} The Surfer made contact with an Astral being and arranged for it to create an astral form in the guise of Galactus whom the Surfer claimed he had summoned to feed upon whichever world struck first. This action seemed to encourage them to postpone hostilities and find a middle ground through politics when in actual fact their leaders conspired to destroy one another's ships simultaneously so neither technically attacked first and their war began.{{r|Silver Surfer: In Thy Name Vol 1 4}}

===[[Sakaar]] and [[Annihilation (Event)|Annihilation]]===
The Surfer came across a wormhole in space which called to him. He went through it in order to investigate but found himself on the savage world of [[Sakaar]]. His journey through the wormhole weakened him to the point that the denizens of Sakaar were able to enslave him using their obedience disks. Despite many of the Sakaarian's believing him to be the Sakaarson, a messianic figure in Sakaaran culture, the Surfer was forced to fight in the Sakaarian gladiatorial arena. After the arrival of the Hulk on Sakaar, the Surfer was pitted against him in the gladiatorial arena. Hulk initially tried to help the Surfer but due to the obedience disk, the Surfer had no choice but to fight him. The Hulk and his companions managed to defeat the Surfer and in the course of the battle, his obedience disk was destroyed. The Surfer used his Power Cosmic to destroy the obedience disks of all the slaves of Sakaar, freeing them to start a rebellion. He offered the Hulk passage back to Earth or another planet of his choice but Hulk declined, saying he had finally found a home. The Surfer then returned to the stars.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 94|95}}

Following the Annihilation Wave's entrance into this universe, Silver Surfer was drawn into the conflict after the death of [[Air-Walker (Automaton) (Earth-616)|Air-Walker]] and chose to again become the herald of Galactus, in order to fight the now-freed [[Tenebrous (Earth-616)|Tenebrous]] and [[Aegis (Proemial God) (Earth-616)|Aegis]] as well as [[Ravenous (Earth-616)|Ravenous]] and his Seekers who were hunting former Heralds. Once he was made a Herald again the Surfer defeated Ravenous with ease but left him alive.{{r|Annihilation: Silver Surfer Vol 1 1|4}} The surfer was later attacked by Aegis and Tenebrous who defeated both him and Galactus.{{r|Annihilation Vol 1 1}} Despite this he was eventually freed from [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]] captivity by [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax]] and succeeded in also freeing Galactus, together they destroyed a large portion of the [[Annihilation Wave (Earth-616)|Annihilation Wave]] by unleashing a powerful wave of energy that came to be known as the 'Galactus Event'. With both the Surfer and Galactus healed, the surfer continued on as Herald under a Galactus with an increased appetite.{{r|{{cl|Annihilation Vol 1 5}}-[[Annihilation Vol 1 6|6]]}} His first order was to ensure the destruction of Aegis and Tenebrous which he achieved by utilizing the Crunch.{{r|Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus Vol 1 2}}

===Galactus' Herald Once More===
Shortly after the superhuman ''[[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]]'' on his formerly adopted planet Earth, the Fantastic Four (then [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|T'Challa]], [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], Human Torch, and Thing), encountered Galactus, [[Lambda-Zero (Earth-616)|Stardust]], and Radd in outer space. The Surfer didn't want to fight the Fantastic Four, but he had to deliver [[Epoch (Earth-616)|Epoch]] for sustenance. Epoch didn't want to be eaten, but she had to pass on what she knew to [[Greg Willis (Earth-616)|Gravity]], who lacked the desire to be the Protector of the Universe, yet grudgingly accepted the role.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 545}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 546}}

Galactus sought energy resources within the planet Orbucen. [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]], the only Centurion remaining after the Annihilation War, pled for Galactus to desist, at least temporarily to give the ships of Orbucen’s population time to evacuate. The Silver Surfer fiercely attacked Nova, and flew both away to another world beyond Galactus’ immediate perceptive range. Nova convinced the Surfer to give the people time to leave.{{r|Nova Vol 4 13|15}}

Shortly afterward the Silver Surfer returned to Sakaar, in a plan to feed Galactus with the unique "old power" which he claimed would sate his master's hunger for thousands of years, and spare many other inhabited worlds in the meantime. He was opposed by the Hulk's son [[Skaar (Earth-616)|Skaar]], and was enslaved by an obedience disc.{{r|Skaar: Son of Hulk Vol 1 7}} The conflict ended when Skaar's mother [[Caiera (Earth-616)|Caiera]] sacrificed her soul and old power as sustenance for Galactus.{{r|Skaar: Son of Hulk Vol 1 7|10}}

===Defenders vs. Offenders===
Simultaneously the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] enlisted a much earlier version of the Surfer to reunite with the other three original Defenders, Doctor Strange, Namor and the Hulk, in a contest against the combined forces of Terrax, [[Karl Mordo (Earth-616)|Baron Mordo]], [[Todd Arliss (Earth-616)|Tiger Shark]], and the [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]], named the "[[Offenders (Earth-616)|Offenders]]". As a prize the Grandmaster offered his champions to restore their dead or otherwise lost love interests. The Surfer and Terrax were teleported by the Grandmaster to the [[Microverse]] to battle. Radd was slain by the Red Hulk and his Power Cosmic was absorbed, but was eventually revived alongside the other Offenders and Defenders by the Grandmaster's death.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 10}}{{r|Hulk Vol 2 11}}

===Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter===
Beta Ray Bill decided that Galactus was indeed a force of destruction threatening all of existence, and set out a dangerous yet shockingly fearful plan to stop the World-Eater. As Galactus reached an idyllic planet to consume, he sent the Silver Surfer to stop Bill and prevent him from interfering, though he was less than successful.{{r|Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter Vol 1 2}}

===Battle Against the High Evolutionary===
After the [[Chaos War]], Galactus was weakened to the point that the Surfer was forced to feed him a star. While Galactus recovered, the Surfer returned to Earth in order to pass the time until his master's return. His relaxation was interrupted by the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] who used his advanced technology to steal the Surfer's power cosmic, returning him to his original form. The Evolutionary planned to use the power cosmic in order to bring life to barren worlds and places, starting with the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]]. Together with [[Suzi Endo (Earth-616)|Suzi Endo]] he attempts to recover his power cosmic and put a stop to the High Evolutionary's plans. The Evolutionary converted Endo into a herald of his own, forcing Norrin to ask the Fantastic Four for help.

They assisted him and tricked Endo into releasing a burst of power cosmic. This burst was enough to trigger a transformation that once again turned Norrin into the Silver Surfer. While he fought Endo and the Evolutionary, Galactus awakened from his slumber and drove the Evolutionary off. Galactus gave the Surfer his freedom and with the cosmic balance now altered due to the terraforming of the Moon, Galactus prepared to consume the Moon. Doing so however would result in an asteroid storm that would wipe out the Earth. The Surfer tried to dissuade Galactus from consuming the Moon, telling him that it couldn't sate his hunger. Galactus retorted that the cosmic balance had been altered and that it was imperative that he consumed it. The Surfer agreed to once again become his Herald and to find him another place to eat. He used his power cosmic to once again make the Moon barren and Galactus removed Endo's power cosmic, returning it to the Surfer.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 6 1|5}}

===Cancerverse===
In the wake of the war between the Shi'ar and the Kree/Inhuman Empire, a massive tear in reality opened, leading to horrifying abominations from a universe without death, began to flow into the universe. Surfer joined Quasar, Nova, Beta Ray Bill, Gladiator, and Ronan the Accuser in an invasion force to stop the twisted versions of themselves from this cancer universe from carrying out their invasion. While in the Cancerverse, Surfer aided in fighting its version of the Avengers, effortlessly taking down the versions of Thor and Iron Man after Nova warned about them being the enemy's heavy hitters. After the invasion was repelled, the surviving members of this team were invited by [[Cosmo (Dog) (Earth-616)|Cosmo]] to form a proactive peacekeeping force of the universe's heaviest hitters, known as the Annihilators.{{Citation}}

===Asgard Affairs===
Galactus searched for the “[[Galactus Seed]]”, a cosmic heart that will give birth to the next universe to come. Created by [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]] before the recording of time and discovered by [[Bor Burison (Earth-616)|Bor]], First King of the Asgardians. The seed birthing the [[Yggdrasill|World Tree]] over which the nine realms hang. Surfer arrived on behalf of Galactus for the seed, which according to the Silver Surfer will sate Galactus’ hunger forever. Prompting [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] to rebuff the Surfer who warns the Asgardians Galactus will come for them. Odin refused, believing that Galactus was in search for godhood making Galactus attack [[Asgard (Realm)|Asgard]] in search for the seed. Galactus was not able to get the seed as Odin was in his way stopping him from getting it. Galactus and Odin fought by using their telekinetic and telepathic powers. Odin was able to render Galactus unconscious by headbutting him before falling into the [[Glossary:Odinsleep|Odinsleep]]. After regaining consciousness Galactus proceeded to attack Asgard in search of the seed despite the fact the Silver Surfer was trying to stop Galactus and telling him that “They are Gods. They are power and fury and an act of war against a race of Gods is beyond even you..." nonetheless, Galactus proceeded until Odin summoned the [[Destroyer (Enchanted Armor)|Destroyer]], which was powered with the seed’s energy. And at the same time, Loki successfully hid the seed, when Surfer detected the seed was gone and informed Galactus. Knowing that his main objective was not under Asgardian possession anymore, Galactus retreated, thus canceling the invasion, and later learned that the seed was lost somewhere within Odin's World Tree, and that searching for it would be like searching for a needle in a pile of space-time. After the event Surfer proposes a truce between Galactus and Asgardians, one of the conditions is if the Surfer senses the seed disturbed then the war continues anew. Needing to stay on Earth to observe the Asgardians and ensure they never retrieved the Seed, the Surfer approached a preacher in [[Broxton]], [[Oklahoma (State)|Oklahoma]], [[Praeter (Mike) (Earth-616)|Mike]], about taking up his role as Herald, having observed Mike's courage in standing up to Galactus for the good of his people. Mike reluctantly accepted the task, becoming Praeter, the latest Herald of Galactus.{{r|{{cl|Mighty Thor Vol 2 1}}-[[Mighty Thor Vol 2 6|6]]}}

===Infinity===
At some point, the Surfer left his vigil on Earth and parted ways with Galactus again. When the [[Builders (Race)|Builders]] began their war against the universe, the Surfer encountered their armies at the Skrull world of [[Hy'lt Minor]]. The Surfer tried in vain to stop the Builder army, but began to question his futile struggle when even at the end, the Skrulls still fought each other, worshiping war itself. The Surfer abandoned the struggle, saving only a single Skrull, [[K'eel R'kt (Earth-616)|K'eel R'kt]]. Despite this, as the Builders continued their war, the Surfer continued his struggle, saving what few he could on other worlds from the Builder onslaught.{{r|Infinity: Against the Tide: Infinite Comic #1}}

===Girl on Board===
As he was exploring the universe, the Surfer was approached by the [[Incredulous Zed (Earth-616)|Incredulous Zed]], who chose him to be the [[Impericon]]'s champion to fight the [[Queen of Nevers (Earth-616)|Queen of Nevers]]. For the Surfer to comply with his request, Zed kidnapped the person who was supposed to be the most important one in the universe for him as determined by a machine who looked into the Surfer's true self: [[Dawn Greenwood (Earth-616)|Dawn Greenwood]]. However, the Surfer didn't even know at all who she was.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 1}}

Still, the Surfer decided to help Zed on behalf of the innocent Dawn. When he met the Queen, she revealed to the Surfer that the Impericon was being powered by her heart, which was stolen from her by Zed, and its absence was slowly killing her. The Surfer agreed to help the Queen retrieve her heart.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 2}} With the help of Dawn, the Surfer retrieved the heart and gave it back to the Queen as he defeated Zed. After the Queen faded away, the Surfer and Dawn set out to explore the universe.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 3}}

[[File:Silver Surfer Vol 8 1 Rudy Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Silver Surfer and Dawn Greenwood]]
After lending Dawn control of his surfboard, the Surfer and his companion accidentally landed on a cloaked planet called [[Newhaven]]. The 666 billion inhabitants of this world were soon revealed to be the sole survivors of their respective species after their planets had been devoured by Galactus. They identified the Surfer, and his past came to light for Dawn Greenwood, who immediately rejected Norrin. The Surfer left Newhaven and Dawn on it at her request, however, the returned Galactus would follow the trail left by Norrin's surfboard in order to find his former herald, and in the middle of said trail was Newhaven.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 8}}

As soon as the Surfer returned to Newhaven in order to give Dawn the opportunity to return to Earth if he wished, Galactus arrived as well.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 9}} The billions of inhabitants from Newhaven were inspired by the Surfer's origin to propose Galactus to become his herald, but he rejected them, as their respective planets had already been destroyed and they were nothing to him. As Galactus had never destroyed the Earth, Dawn proposed to become his herald. The Surfer tried to prevent Galactus from transforming Dawn at the same time he muttered his motive: his love for Dawn. The Earthgirl's sacrifice inspired the inhabitants of Newhaven to evacuate their planet and give it to Galactus in exchange for the girl. Newhaven was destroyed, but the Surfer swore to become the herald of its survivors in order to find them a new planet to live in.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 10}}

After weeks of searching, the Surfer finally discovered a suitable planet, with a special adaptive atmosphere which allowed the inhabitation of different specimens from different races.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 11}} As Dawn decided whether to return to Earth or not, months were spent by the Surfer at this "New Newhaven," and Dawn started getting close to the Surfer once more. Norrin subsequently sensed something was wrong, used his powers to reveal the planet's true nature, and "New Newhaven" revealed itself as [[Euphoria (Earth-616)|Euphoria]], a living creature who had used its adaptive atmosphere to protect itself from the survivors' grief by inducing them happiness and controlling their actions to ensure their well-being. A group of the survivors decided to leave the planet as they didn't want to be Euphoria's puppets, but the vast majority remained on it. Now the Surfer and Dawn were free of its influence and decided to return to Earth. Dawn confessed her true feelings to Norrin without being influenced by Euphoria any longer, and kissed him as they departed.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 12}}

During their continuing journey to explore the universe, the Surfer and Dawn found themselves attempting to outrun the collapse of the [[Multiverse]] caused by the final [[Glossary:Incursion|incursion]]. They managed to escape to a plane of non-existence, a [[Land of Couldn't-Be Shouldn't-Be]], with the help of [[Thomas Gideon (Earth-616)|Glorian]].

When Norrin encountered Eternity, all that remained within him was the newly created [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]] and its satellite [[Knowhere]], fashioned by the sheer force of will of God Emperor Doom. With the remains of the Multiverse under Doom's control, Glorian offered the Silver Surfer a chance at recreating the old universe with the power of his master, the [[Shaper of Worlds (Earth-616)|Shaper of Worlds]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 13}} At the behest of the Shaper of Worlds, Dawn and the Silver Surfer then began recreating [[Earth-616|the known universe]], with Glorian and the Surfer focusing on the cosmic, while Dawn and Zee concentrated on Earth. But the pair soon began to alter things to their own desires. The Surfer resurrected then killed Galactus; meanwhile, Dawn quickly realized that her crafting was merely two-dimensional, so she accidentally created another Silver Surfer to help her, but all the changes upset the Shaper of Worlds.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 14}}

[[File:Silver Surfer Vol 7 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]
Once most of these anomalies were dealt with, only the duplicate Silver Surfer remained. The Shaper made Dawn choose between one of the Surfers, however, Glorian was impatient for the universe to be finished and killed the Shaper, whose power had been depleted during the creation of the universe. Glorian revealed that his ultimate goal was to break free from the Shaper's commands, for which he had waited until his master was weak enough to kill him. The Surfer and Dawn managed to escape from Glorian and bring back the Queen of Nevers, whose heart had been recreated in this new universe. The Surfer was forced to choose between Glorian's universe and [[Earth-15513|what remained of the rest of the Multiverse]]. However, at that very same time, the old universe was brought back. The Silver Surfer managed to resist the temptation of Glorian's perfect universe, which was in the end a simple hollow day-dream. The Surfer chose his old universe, and returned with Dawn to it to continue their journey of exploration.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 15}}

===Timeless===
While visiting Dawn's family on Earth, the Silver Surfer fended off a [[Zenn-Lavians|Zenn-Lavian]] invasion led by none other than Shalla-Bal, who had become the successor of the mantle of the Keeper of the Great Truth. Using a powerful reality-warping device called the [[Illuminatrix]], the invading aliens attempted to replace all of Earth's culture with Zenn-La's.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 2}} Norrin stopped the Zenn-Lavians and reversed the damage caused by the Illuminatrix, though at the cost of all traces of Zenn-Lavian culture in the universe{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 3}} and his status as a member of his people.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 4}} Before returning to space, Norrin reunited Dawn with her estranged mother, [[Libby Windham (Earth-616)|Libby Windham]],{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 5}} though the reunion did more harm than good.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 6}}

One of Norrin and Dawn's adventures took them to the planet of [[Inkandessa 4]], where all of its inhabitants had had their consciousness copied into holographic forms of solid light to avoid leaving any impact in the ecosystem, using devices called [[Holo-Pod|Holo-Pods]] to scan their essence. Due to Dawn's nature as an organic being, she was unsuspectingly scanned against her will and replaced with a [[Dawn Greenwood (Light-Form) (Earth-616)|holographic Dawn Greenwood]]. Though Dawn's duplicate rescued the real Dawn from being killed, she had to stay behind in Inkandessa 4, as all [[Light-Forms]] needed to remain in the planet to continue existing.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 9}}

[[File:Silver Surfer Vol 8 13 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Aging with Dawn]]
Dawn and Norrin returned to Earth briefly afterwards to meet Dawn's newborn niece, [[Regina Prado (Earth-616)|Regina]]. When they arrived, they also learned that Dawn's father [[Reg Greenwood (Earth-616)|Reg]] had died of heart issues shortly after the baby's birth.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 11}} Dawn requested the Surfer to return to Euphoria to help her cope with her father's death. They remained there for sixty-seven days until Dawn came to terms with her loss.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 12}} However, Dawn felt the need to say goodbye to Reg, and asked Norrin to travel back in time to see him for one last time. Norrin conceded, but accidentally overshot, and they ended up in the time before the Big Bang, in the iteration of the universe from where [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] hailed, with no way to return home. Together, they explored the universe for decades, and married in the process. Norrin used his Power Cosmic to alter his appearance and age together with Dawn. As Dawn reached her golden years, she and Norrin settled in [[Taa]]. To make up for their inability to continue exploring, Norrin spent the rest of Dawn's days sharing his adventures from before he had met her. On her deathbed, Norrin and Dawn recalled their first meeting.

When the universe was coming to an end, Norrin transformed Dawn's buried remains into energy and took it with him inside Galan's [[Lifebringer One (Item)|Incubator]], where he could survive the death of the universe and emerge in the next one. The Surfer fired Dawn's bolt of energy at the start of creation, which became the very first light in the universe, forever echoing throughout all of time. In this moment Norrin additionally crafted the energy signature of the Power Cosmic, red with black dots, and dedicated it to Dawn so the love and memory of her would flow forever through him. The Surfer proceeded to spend eons alone until Eternity manifested himself. In order to prevent his presence in the past to alter history, Norrin both disguised and concealed himself, taking a different appearance and the name of "Nor-Vill" and shifting out of phase with existence itself. While waiting to reach his original point in time, Norrin became a ghostly observer for the history of the universe, particularly of Galactus' feats of destruction.

[[File:Norrin Radd (Earth-616) from Silver Surfer Vol 8 14 001.jpg|thumb|right]]
Norrin eventually decided to travel to Earth, and became a regular fleeting visitor of the [[Greenwood Inn]] under the disguise of Norville Rapaport, watching Dawn grow up and spending time with her with each visit he paid. When Dawn was abducted by the Incredulous Zed and rescued by the Surfer's past-self, "Nor-Vill" silently followed them through their many adventures until the point they traveled back in time. With the past Dawn and Norrin out of the picture, Nor-Vill ditched his eons-old disguise and returned to his true self, the Silver Surfer. Norrin returned to Earth and delivered the news of Dawn's fate to her family. He also convinced Eve and Costas to copy their essence and that of their baby into Holo-Pods so they could reunite with the Holo Dawn in [[Inkandessa 4]]. Norrin additionally created holographic copies of Reg, taken from a time before he died, and himself, so a part of him could live out his days with Dawn. Norrin bid his friends farewell and returned to exploring the universe, accompanied by Dawn's love and memory.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 13}}

===[[Infinity Countdown]]===
Sometime later, Norrin was captured by [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ult]][[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|ron]] and taken to the planet [[Saiph (Planet)|Saiph]], where Ultron had infected him with his [[Ultron Virus]] using the power of his newly acquired [[Soul Stone|Soul Gem]].{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 2}} To encourage Norrin's compliance, Ultron used the Soul Gem to make him listen to the screams of the countless lives taken by Galactus. [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]] was able to free Norrin from Ultron's control by wrapping him in a healing cocoon. After emerging from the cocoon, Norrin fled Saiph and asked Galactus to consume Saiph in order to save the galaxy from Ultron.{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 3}} Though reluctant at first, Galactus agreed to destroy Saiph, on the condition that the Silver Surfer returned to serving as his herald, since the consumption of the planet caused Galactus' hunger to return.{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 4}}

===[[Herald Supreme]]===
When the Silver Surfer lead Galactus to the [[Zaraxians]]' homeworld, the [[Magic (Power)|magically]]-powered race fought back and subdued the Surfer. They read his mind in order to find a weakness that could prevent Galactus from consuming their planet. After finding that one weakness was Earth, they sent their greatest sorcerer, [[Zoloz (Earth-616)|Zoloz]], to Earth and get help, while the Surfer escaped. The alien sorcerer returned and banished Galactus to the [[Mystic Realms]],{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 5 12}} where the latter begun consuming the magic, unbalancing the universe. The Surfer and other cosmic figures went to the Mystic Realms to stop him, as science and magic had begun merging together, causing chaos. The Surfer pleaded for Galactus to stop, but the cosmic being killed his herald.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 5 15|16}} However, once the universe collapsed, Doctor Strange recreated it, resurrecting everyone. Zoloz, inspired by the Surfer, also became a herald of Galactus, allowing his planet to be spared.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 5 17}}

===Thanos' Death and Stranded in the Past===
Norrin was among the cosmic superheroes called to bear witness to the will of Thanos following the Mad Titan's death. When the [[Black Order (Earth-616)|Black Order]] created a black hole in order to steal Thanos' body, Norrin entered it to rescue those who had been pulled inside.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 1}} Trapped inside the black hole, Norrin found himself pulled through space and time, winding up billions of years in the past. Sensing a dark presence attempting to extinguish the nascent universe, the Silver Surfer traced it to a dark world encased in the living abyss. Attacked by three symbiote-possessed goddesses guarding a large Gigeresque door, Norrin was nearly engulfed by the abyss but conjured a miniature sun - his hand turning black in the process. Approaching the door, Norrin was grabbed and pulled through - finding himself on the throneworld of the Symbiote Imperium and in the presence of the abyssal god [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]].{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}} The Silver Surfer attempted to fight against Knull, but was easily overpowered and bonded to a symbiote, turning him into the [[Void Knight (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Void Knight]]. Ego the Living Planet interceded and freed Radd from Knull's control, helping him escape and offering to help him vanquish the abyssal god.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}} 

Noticing that Ego was dying, the Silver Surfer entered the Living Planet's core and found the Lifebringer One inside.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 3}} Extracting it, he attempted to kill the nascent Galactus but was stopped by [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu the Watcher]], who informed him that changing the future would not undo his past. Setting the Lifebringer One on a course for [[Archeopia]], the Silver Surfer returned to Ego, who granted him a boon of divine light harvested from across the universe.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 4}} Knull attacked and the Silver Surfer engaged him in a duel, but he was overpowered. Taking advantage of Knull gloating, the Silver Surfer expended the last of his Power Cosmic to conjure a star right in Knull's face, blasting the dark god across the cosmos. Dying, the Silver Surfer fell to a nearby planet and manifested the light energy given to him by Ego as divine seeds; planting them before his physical form perished. Spreading across the cosmos, the Silver Surfer's essence gave life to the planets that Galactus had devoured with his aid; and he eventually regained enough power to manifest a visible but intangible form at the exact moment he had been sent into the past, his body stained black by his encounter with Knull.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 5}}

Following the battle between the Guardians of the Galaxy and a future version of the Universal Church of Truth lead by [[J'son (Earth-616)|Patriarch]], the Surfer paid a visit to a recovering [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]], where he told his story to them.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 12}}

===[[Annihilation - Scourge]]===
[[File:Norrin Radd (Earth-616) and Robert Reynolds (Earth-616) from Annihilation - Scourge Silver Surfer Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|Merged with the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]]]]
After the Silver Surfer fought against the [[Revengers (Earth-10011)|Revengers]] and the [[Defenders (Earth-10011)|Defenders]], and visited the [[Earth-10011|Cancerverse]], he then approached a powerless [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] who had been separated from the [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|Void]]. The Surfer merged with Sentry in order to fight the Void who had become the leader of the Cancerverse's Forces.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Silver Surfer #1}} Upon arriving at the Negative Zone, the Surfer came across Beta Ray Bill, with [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]], and the Fantastic Four, who were fighting the monsters. They arrived at the planet where the refugees were hiding. However, the Void arrived and attacked them, but luckily, Reed Richards used his Dimensional Anchor for the various heroes to also arrived and aid them in the battle against the Cancerverse. During the battle, the Surfer managed to remerge Bob with the Void, while Richard Rider sacrificed himself in order to defeat the Cancerverse's Forces. In the aftermath, the heroes returned to their lives, with the Surfer assisting Annihilus at resurrecting Nova.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge Omega Vol 1 1}}

===[[Starbrand Reborn]]===
As the [[Star Brand (Object)|Starbrand]] resurfaced, the Surfer gathered Terrax and Firelord to unite their forces in tracking down the Starbrand. However, he faced the Avengers, who were also in a quest to locate the Starbrand, and tried to fight them off, only for them to crash land on a planet.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 27|28}} The Surfer engaged in a fight against [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|War Widow]] and [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]] who tried to reason with the Surfer, but he kept fighting stating that there was no other way. They kept fighting until they finally witnessed the new [[Suzanne Selby (Earth-616)|Starbrand]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 29}} After finding out that the Starbrand was pregnant with a child, the Surfer decided to spare her despite the threat. While Cap was delivering the baby the Surfer turned on his fellow heralds in order to not let them interfere with the birth. After the [[Brandy Selby (Earth-616)|baby]] was successfully delivered, the three heralds discussed with each other and all decided to spare the new Starbrand and each gave her a "gift", with the Surfer giving her and the Avengers hope.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 30}}

===[[Devourer King|Black Winter]]===
When the [[Black Winter]], the cause of the destruction of Galactus' universe, was returning, the Surfer, along with the other heralds, informed All-Father Thor on what the Black Winter was and why Galactus had fallen to [[Asgard]]. Once Galactus awoke, the Surfer offered to his master help in defeating the Black Winter, but instead Galactus turned Thor into his own herald, since Thor was stated to bring death to both the Black Winter and Galactus himself.{{r|Thor Vol 6 1}} Later, after arriving at the [[Hlidskjalf]], the Silver Surfer was greeted by Thor - who was attempting to drink himself into a stupor. Descending from his surfboard, the Surfer apologized for interrupting. The Surfer remarked that the galaxy shook with the reverberations of Thor's battle against the Black Winter. Standing, the Surfer states that Sif told him Thor had been holed up for months and hadn't spoken of what transpired during his battle. The Surfer offers a sympathetic ear, but Thor brusquely rebukes him; saying that no-one had seen what he saw and that knowledge was his burden alone. As the Surfer remarked that the burden of knowledge was heavy, Thor agreed and glanced to where Mjolnir sat beside his throne. The Surfer again appealed to Thor to share what happened, remarking from personal experience that hiding away and bottling his anguish up will help no-one in the long run. Thor was revealed to have used Galactus' helmet as an entryway to his throne room. Digesting what Thor has told him, the Surfer expressed remorse for his former master, though Thor had no pity for Galactus. The Surfer cautiously asked what the Black Winter showed Thor, but Thor refused to divulge what he witnessed, saying “I saw...darkness. And nothing more”. But this was a lie, Thor had seen a possible future in which the heroes of Earth had been turned into zombies, and Thanos used Mjolnir.{{r|Thor Vol 6 6}}

===Return to [[Glossary:Sixth Cosmos|Sixth Cosmos]]===
The Surfer was summoned by Doctor Strange to rejoin the Defenders in order to chase down [[Enclave (Earth-616)|Enclave]] scientist [[Carlo Zota (Earth-616)|Carlo Zota]] who had used a time-travel spell created by [[Sise-Neg (Earth-74113)|Sise-Neg]] that had the potential to damage the multiverse. Doctor Strange cast a spell for the team to follow him and the Surfer found himself once again in the previous iteration of the Multiverse on the planet [[Taa]] which was being attacked by that worlds planet-eater [[Moridun (Earth-616)|Omnimax]].{{r|Defenders Vol 6 1}} They ended up teaming up with that worlds hero [[Taaia (Earth-616)|Taaia]] to protect the planet. She took the team home with her to plan their next move where he met the future Galactus as a baby and realized Taaia was his mother. Realizing Galan's mother was inattentive he decided to use the opportunity to teach him compassion, hoping it would encourage him to try harder to resist his hunger in the future. He was confronted by the [[Masked Raider III (Earth-616)|Masked Raider]] who believed he was trying to kill the infant, he admitted he knew who he was under the mask because he could read his aura but wasn't interested in revealing his identity. The raider told him he brought the team together for a reason but wasn't gonna let any of them ruin his plans to stop Zota. The next day the team went to confront Omnimax directly and the Surfer ended up fighting Zota who had become his herald. Zota appeared to have the advantage since Omnimax was much more powerful than Galactus but the Surfer convinced Zota to try and steal his power and then easily depowered him as his very long life had given him much more experience with their power source than Zota. Doctor Strange and Taaia put his magic and her science together to defeat Omnimax but after doing so they were all taken further back in time to the [[Glossary:Fifth Cosmos|Fifth Cosmos]] leaving only the Surfer behind.{{r|Defenders Vol 6 2}}

[[File:Annihilation Silver Surfer Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|Wielder of the Power Cosmic]]
Currently, the Silver Surfer is one of the most powerful beings in the universe, and the most powerful of the Heralds of Galactus. He was deemed to be an '''Alpha Plus''' by the [[Galadorian]] [[Spaceknights (Galadorian) (Earth-616)|Spaceknight]] [[Ikon (Earth-616)|Ikon]],{{r|Annihilators #1}} and potentially an universal-level threat by the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]].{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files #1}}
Thanks to [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]], he possesses the following abilities:
* '''The Power Cosmic:''' The Silver Surfer was endowed with the Power Cosmic, which is the core from which his abilities manifest from. This power was granted to him by Galactus, and amplified during the Annihilation event. The Power Cosmic is a source of ambient cosmic energy permeating the universe that makes possible the channeling and manipulation of energy.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Fantastic Four 2005 Vol 1 1}} Based on cumulative evidence from beings with similar magnitudes of power and his own feats, the Surfer's maximum power output ranges from the casual planetoid/planet{{r|Annihilation: Silver Surfer #4}}{{r|Silver Surfer Annual #7}} and planet level,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 3}}{{r|Silver Surfer: The Enslavers Vol 1 1}} to the level of a compact star,{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}} and plausibly, by employing his vast channeling ability, and by adding and combining himself with another being, to solar system level without overloading himself (presumably still accounting for a solar system's destruction on his own power).{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 112|120}} The Silver Surfer has also regularly faced opponents with similar raw power, such as the [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Mighty Thor]]{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 2 2|3}} and [[Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616)|Beta Ray Bill]],{{r|Beta Ray Bill: Godhunter #2}} who together destroyed a gigantic star-dwarfing portal as an extreme high-end feat.{{r|The Mighty Thor: The Ballad of Beta Ray Bill TPB Vol 1 1}}
** '''Energy Absorption and Manipulation:''' The absorption of electromagnetic energy is the base of the Surfer's life and power. The Silver Surfer has complete control of the four fundamental forces of the universe, reaching nearly any effect he desires. As a result, the Surfer can absorb, manipulate and discharge tremendous amounts of energy across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The Silver Surfer has claimed several times to hold enough power to easily shatter planets.{{r|Fantastic Four #156}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 98}}{{r|Tomb of Dracula Vol 1 50}} The Surfer's incredible powers also surpass [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] while he held the entirety of the [[Glossary:Nova Force|Nova Force]] and [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]], with sufficient force to casually destroy planets,{{r|Annihilation: Silver Surfer #4}}{{r|Silver Surfer Annual #7}} and a large fraction of a structure whose size easily dwarfed Earth.{{r|Silver Surfer: The Enslavers Vol 1 1}} Upon utilizing his ability to channel vast amounts of cosmic energy, and by merging his essence with another being as mean of connection with the Uni-Lord, he could destroy an entire solar system.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 112|120}} Currently, at maximum, his beams are capable of almost killing [[Ravenous (Earth-616)|Ravenous]],{{r|Annihilation: Silver Surfer #4}} equaling [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]],{{Citation}} and hurting [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] who was wearing [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] armor.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 2 3}}
*Additional abilities include:
:* Erecting force fields, phasing through solid matter,{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files #1}} using the build-up of energy within himself to increase his strength,{{r|Fantastic Four #55}} creating stable black holes,{{r|Annihilation: Silver Surfer #1}} creating a compact star while extremely weakened,{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}} creating solid energy often in the forms of a cocoon or barrier,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 50}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 130}} restabilizing and recharging a star,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 1}} accelerating the evolution of lifeforms on a planet-wide scale,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 104}} seeing the past by peeling back the layers of time, time travel,{{r|Silver Surfer #6}} trans-dimensional travel, bestowing limited cosmic powers to others, telepathically reading minds,{{r|Tales to Astonish #93}} casting illusions,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 33}} temporarily animating the inanimate and sharing a portion of his power and consciousness with it,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 127}} and emphatically influencing human emotion and sensation.{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files #1}} The Surfer also possesses the ability to suppress or absorb the powers of other beings, making them temporarily or permanently unable to use them, as he did once with the Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 250}} He can heal living beings, even if they are near-death. He cannot, however, raise the dead.{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files #1}}
:* '''Matter Manipulation:''' The Silver Surfer can alter matter by rearranging molecules. He can also change the state of matter, such as making solids into gas.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 96}} Transmutation helps the Surfer escape traps and prisons, and can also be used to make an enemy's weapons inactive. He is able to bend his own molecular structure so as to transform himself to appear human.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 127}}
* '''Superhuman Physical Abilities:'''
** '''[[Superhuman Strength]]:''' The Surfer possesses enormous superhuman strength. Though the exact magnitude remains vague, the Surfer has often been shown to fight evenly with people who can lift far in excess of 100 tons. He can also channel the build-up of energy within himself to increase his strength to incalculable levels.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Fantastic Four 2005 Vol 1 1}}{{r|Fantastic Four #55}} He managed to pulverize diamonds with no effort,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #39}} stopped a charging Rhino,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 54}} and when in a weak state he even managed to overcome and defeat the [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Abomination]] with little effort.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 #12}} The Surfer also forcefully redirected a starship's path and launched it into the outer solar system, and it was stated that it would continue on its straight-line path for centuries.{{r|Defenders Vol 4 3}} He escaped from Quasar's construct,{{r|Cosmic Powers Unlimited Vol 1 5}} broke out of a planet that Michael Korvac formed by using nearby asteroids,{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 16 }} physically subjugated a dwarf star thrown on him by an enhanced Deadpool and easily redirected it into outer space,{{r|Deadpool Team-Up Vol 2 883}} and using his speed and strength, the Surfer shattered through several [[Vibranium]] walls that exploded on contact to save [[Frankie Raye (Earth-616)|Nova]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #1}} When he was extremely weakened, he still managed to pull the Galactus Incubator out of the young living planet Ego,{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 3}} and then throw it a few light-years away,{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 4}} and throw [[Stormbreaker]] out of a [[Glossary:Black Hole|black hole]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 1}}{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}} The Surfer's potential strength was once said to rival the Hulk's limitless rage-enhanced strength.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12}}
** '''Invulnerability:''' The Silver Surfer's silvery "skin" was designed to easily withstand the rigors of deep-space travel, and thus far, it has proven to be virtually indestructible. Among things that include simple blunt force, like withstanding a punch from [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] without flinching back when the She-Hulk's power level was still just class 75, and not far above class 100 as it is today.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 36}} The Silver Surfer can withstand even the most extreme conditions, like the crushing pressures of a black hole.{{r|{{cl|Galactus the Devourer Vol 1 1}}-[[Galactus the Devourer Vol 1 6|6]]}}{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 1}}{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}} He is not bothered by the friction associated with atmospheric re-entry, and has withstood plunges into stars,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 37}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 134}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 6 1}} and supernovas unharmed.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 48}} He also routinely weathers the stresses associated with high-speed travel through space and hyperspace.
***'''Soul Manipulation and Soul Resistance:''' By channeling his cosmic power, Silver Surfer can enter the [[Astral Plane]], which he describes as the source of his power and where he was able to destroy the soul of an enemy. He is also immune to soul absorption, has withstood the Soul Stone,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #16}} has more than enough spare life force,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 #6}} and not even the stealing tongue of the Wraith Queen mind managed to effect the Silver Surfer,{{r|Annihilators Vol 1 #3}} and most impressively he has resisted being absorbed by Mephisto.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 #3}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 #8}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 2 #1}} Mephisto did manage to steal Silver Surfer’s soul once, but the Surfer managed to recover it.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #100}} The only time Silver Surfer's soul was completely taken away was by Thanos who owned the Infinity Gauntlet and used the Soul Stone. Although the Soul Stone failed to absorb Silver Surfer's soul,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 16}} although Thanos was later able to use the Soul Stone to remove the souls of the Silver Surfer and Drax the Destroyer after the stone was placed within the gauntlet.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 44|47}}
** '''Godlike Stamina:''' The Surfer's highly enhanced musculature generates no fatigue toxins, body stress, or even sweat, granting him inexhaustible physical stamina, which allows him to fight other beings for prolonged periods of time before tiring, if he even gets tired. 
** '''Flight Speed:''' Prior to his upgrade, the Silver Surfer was one of the fastest beings in the universe, but he was greatly outmatched by the [[Gilpetperdon (Earth-616)|Runner]] of the [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elders of the Universe]]. Currently, he is faster than Beta Ray Bill and Nova. The Silver Surfer can travel at speeds faster than light. He can enter [[Glossary:hyperspace|Hyperspace]] when he exceeds the speed of light,{{r|Silver Surfer Annual Vol 1 2}}{{r|Silver Surfer / Thor Annual Vol 1 1998}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Fantastic Four 2005 Vol 1 1}} although he is also able to accelerate and achieve faster than light speeds without accessing hyperspace.{{r|Silver Surfer #6}}{{r|Thor Vol 1 193}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 129}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 131}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 13}} For example of his speed, Dracula's hurricane wasn't enough to knock him off balance or slow him down,{{r|Tomb of Dracula Vol 1 50}} he has used his speed to easily destroy Warships,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 25}}{{r|Annihilation: Silver Surfer Vol 1 3}} traveled light years in just 1 second,{{r|Annihilation: Silver Surfer Vol 1 1}} quickly traveled half a million light years,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 109}} left Earth and traversed half the galaxy in search of food for Galactus to consume in mere seconds,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 77}} in just moments, the Surfer flew out of a galaxy,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 32}} and in a few minutes the Surfer traveled from Earth to halfway across the universe following a call echoing through creation.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 4 1}} His speed has been described as “distorting space-time, flying from one side of the universe to the other.”{{r|Silver Surfer: The Enslavers Vol 1 1}} Finally, his mind and body can be used at these speeds as well, making the Surfer extremely reactive and agile. The Surfer has searched the entire planet for Namor in less time than it took for Doctor Strange to finish a sentence,{{r|Silver Surfer Annual Vol 1 5}} analysed every planet in numerous galaxies in a matter of hours,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 6}} and has several times reacted in the space of a microsecond,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 2}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 9}} and even in the range of a nanosecond.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 1}}
***'''Cosmic Self-Flight:''' Silver Surfer can fly without his Cosmic Surfboard, projecting cosmic energy through his hands in a manner similar to Iron Man's [[repulsors]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 1}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 7}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 3}}
**'''[[Superhuman Agility]]:''' Silver Surfer has greater agility, balance, dexterity, flexibility, equilibrium and bodily coordination than that of an Olympic-level athlete. But Silver Surfer rarely shows this ability. While flying, he easily dodges bullets and anti-aircraft missiles from military planes,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 123}} dodges Kree blaster fire,{{Citation}} dodged Cyborg Superman's laser beams at point-blank range,{{r|Green Lantern / Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances Vol 1 1}} and even managed to coordinate his body to avoid a barrage of laser beams coming from several spacecraft simultaneously.{{Citation}}
*'''Cosmic Awareness:''' His cosmic sense can allow him to comprehend rules of the universe others would find incomprehensible,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 6 3}} as well as being able to sense energy concentration anywhere in the universe, sense a human trapped in a falling capsule,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 1}} read the spark of electrons and surge of chemicals in people,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 6 1}} feel the culture of Earth being stolen,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 1}} and being able to sense that Mephisto was up to something.{{Citation}} He can also determine the nature of new energy sources, locations, and determine the nature of an energy source and who the beings who created it were.{{r|Thanos: The Infinity Revelation Vol 1 1}} Silver surfer can sense pure consciousness,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 -1}} and sensed Galactus rising 93 million miles away from the sun.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 6 5}} Silver Surfer was able to sense the weakness of Gladiator.{{r|{{cl|Galactus the Devourer Vol 1 1}}-[[Galactus the Devourer Vol 1 6|6]]}} While in a state of powerlessness, he stated he could've sensed Johnny Storm's death from halfway across the universe.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 6 4}} Silver Surfer was able to sense the deaths of billions of beings being killed by Thanos.{{r|Infinity Gauntlet Vol 1 1}} His Cosmic Awareness can also see as far back as the previous universe as he saw Galactus' origin.{{Citation}} He also managed to feel an imbalance in the Power Cosmic,{{r|Captain Universe: Silver Surfer Vol 1 1}} and the High Evolutionary with the Silver Surfer's Power Cosmic was surprised with how much cosmic awareness the Surfer had and how much knowledge he gained so quickly and was able to use the cosmic awareness to find and call out to Galactus' ship across the universe.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 6 2}}
** '''Cosmic Senses:''' The Silver Surfer has certain cosmic-energy enhanced perceptions which enable him, through concentration, to become aware of the patterns of energy anywhere in the world.{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia Vol 1}} These abilities allow him far-ranging vision (in space he can see people clearly over a light year away), the ability to see subatomic particles, superhuman hearing, the ability to detect fields, traces, and concentrations of pure forms of energy and discern their natures.{{r|Fantastic Four #260}} The Surfer learnt quite a lot of Earth culture due to his cosmic senses,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 4}} and he also found the greatest ice cream in the universe,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 6}} felt billions of beings on a planet,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 8}} and was able to detect new life forms and determine their abilities.{{r|Cosmic Powers Unlimited Vol 1 #4}} Currently the abilities of the Surfer surpass even those of Stardust.{{Citation}} 
***'''Cosmic Sight:''' Silver Surfer's vision is improved, allowing him to see farther than a normal human. He can change vision between visible spectra,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 11}} infrared vision,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 23}} can see signatures / paths of psionic energy,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 31}} adjusts his vision to continuous brightness,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 24}} and can see all things up to the “nanoscopic scale”.{{r|Defenders Vol 4 9 }} He can see through illusions,{{r| Fear Itself: The Deep Vol 1 3}} as strong as the Stranger's,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 27}} a cosmic entity that is of the same class as Galactus.{{r|Thanos Annual Vol 1 1}} He can see beyond sub-atomic levels.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 37}} He is able to detect and track Thanos' teleportation path, which is so advanced that the Surfer describes him as a rival to Galactus' level of technology,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 37}} he can perceive dimensional things that mortals cannot,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 134}} and can see what's in the universe even if it is billions of light-years away while keeping its clarity perfectly.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 7}} 
****'''Cosmic Vision:''' Can perceive time as one, watching the past, present, and future at once,{{r|Annihilators Vol 1 2}} and can project this effect for others to see.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 138}}
***'''Cosmic Hearing:''' Silver Surfer is capable of hearing sounds from a far greater distance than any human. Silver Surfer can know that the person he's talking to is a Skrull in the form of a human just from hearing their heartbeat,{{Citation}} and can hear whispers from Earth while on the moon,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 6 5}} as well as being able to “hear heartbeats from a light year away”.{{r|Star Masters Vol 1 3}}
* '''Cosmic Self-Sustenance:''' The Silver Surfer does not need to eat or breathe since he absorbs life-maintaining cosmic energy directly through his skin.
**'''[[Healing Factor|Regenerative Healing Factor]]:''' Despite his invulnerability, Silver Surfer can be injured, but can heal and regenerate immediately using the Power Cosmic. He healed immediately after being eaten by eagles (Silver Surfer does it intentionally to experience "life and death ..."),{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 2 9}} fixed his severed hand,{{r|Annihilators Vol 1 1|2}} restored his arm after being cut off,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 7 7}} upon the return of half of his cosmic essence, was instantly healed and at maximum power,{{r|Silver Surfer: The Enslavers Vol 1 1}} and healed from being cut up multiple times when the Cosmic Power was being restored to him.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 24}} He has managed to fully recover from complete atomic destruction during his battle with Uni-Lord.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 120}} He can exist without his body; and turn into air and/or snow and can reform himself.{{r|Defenders Vol 4 1}}
***'''[[Glossary:Healing|Healing]]:''' Like his regenerative healing factor, Silver Surfer is able to quickly heal others by concentrating Cosmic Power in their bodies, thus stimulating the healing processes. He managed to heal a bullet wound,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 54}} healed Carla from multiple bullet wounds,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 6 1}} healed Syrrh from a blaster wound,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 99}} and healed the massive blaster wound of a creatures.{{Citation}} The Silver Surfer managed to heal a Watcher,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #119}} offered Alicia Masters, a blind woman, a one-touch view of the world, although not permanent,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #123}} temporarily modified the chemistry of a drug-addicted woman's body to remove drugs from her system,{{r|Silver Surfer Annual Vol 1 1997}} and cured thousands of plagues at the molecular level.{{r|Cosmic Powers Unlimited Vol 1 #4}} Even if Silver Surfer cannot raise people from the dead, he can heal people who are on the verge of death.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 #3}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 #12}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #133}}
**'''Immortality:''' Due to his ability to sustain himself, the Silver Surfer is virtually immortal. He is approximately 13.7 billion years old due to having traveled back in time to a previous incarnation of the universe and simply waiting out until the present caught up with him.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 8 14}}
*'''Size Manipulation:''' Silver Surfer is able to use the Power Cosmic to manipulate his size. Silver Surfer managed to shrink to sub-atomic size and enter the Microverse,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 75}} and exit to return to normal size.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 77}} The Silver Surfer even managed to shrink to such a small size that, to him, atoms were the size of "planets ...then solar system" to escape a black hole.{{r|{{cl|Galactus the Devourer Vol 1 1}}-[[Galactus the Devourer Vol 1 6|6]]}} Silver Surfer can change the size of other people and things, for example he managed to bring Metropolis and all its inhabitants back to their normal size.{{r|Silver Surfer / Superman Vol 1 1}}
*'''[[Glossary:Teleportation|Teleportation]]:''' Silver Surfer has displayed the ability to teleport.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 5}} Silver Surfer also showed that he is able to teleport others, for example he managed to teleport all the ones who were on [[Sanctuary (Vehicle)|Sanctuary]],{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 1}} while they were inside a [[Glossary:Black Hole|black hole]].{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}}
**'''Portal Creation:''' Silver Surfer can create portals and gates in order to transport to another location.

* '''[[Intangibility]]:''' After reconstituting himself following his "death" battling Knull,{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 5}} the Silver Surfer became intangible. While he is unable to interact with physical objects, he can still affect them with his Power Cosmic and can merge with other living creatures in a manner similar to a symbiote.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Silver Surfer Vol 1 1}}
*'''[[Astral Projection]]:''' The Surfer can project his astral form outside of his physical body, when in astral form he can perceive and interact with other beings made of spirit, even causing them harm.{{r|Silver Surfer: In Thy Name Vol 1 2}} The Surfer claimed that he could not be harmed in the [[Astral Plane]] as it was the source of the Power Cosmic.{{r|Silver Surfer: In Thy Name Vol 1 3}} The Surfer and Mephisto battle in their astral forms.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 135|136}} 
**'''Possession:''' When Silver Surfer is in astral form he can possess people. He has managed to possess Alicia Masters and give her the power to fight Agatha Harkness (who was possessed by Mephisto).{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 137}}

*'''Elemental Manipulation:''' Thanks to the Power Cosmic, Silver Surfer can manipulate the elements, these include:
**'''[[Pyrokinesis]]:''' Generate heat, as well as create and manipulate fire.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 1 14}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 104}} Silver Surfer can raise the temperature of its flames to the point where it burns hotter than a Nova. {{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 16}}

| Abilities               = As Norrin Radd, the Surfer was a scientist, a dreamer, and something of a philosopher, skills which he sometimes finds quite useful. The Surfer, however, is only an average hand-to-hand combatant, depending almost entirely upon his cosmic powers in battle. However, he has shown mastery of Zenn-Lavian 'hypno disciplines' which allow him to hypnotize his enemies long enough to deal with them even when bereft of the Power Cosmic.{{r|Silver Surfer: Loftier Than Mortals # 1}} After his time on Sakaar, Surfer gained some combat experience, making him a more dangerous combatant than ever.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 94}} The Surfer has also eventually been recognized to normally hold back and not manifest his full power.{{r|Avengers Annual #11}}

| Equipment               = '''[[Silver Surfer's Surfboard|Cosmic Surfboard]]:''' When flying, the Silver Surfer uses a construct which resembles an earthly surfboard. This "board" is made with the same silvery material (The Galactic Glaze) that composes the Surfer's body, thus making the board indestructible. Few forces aside from the power cosmic itself can affect it, and if it is somehow damaged, the Surfer can easily repair it in an instant as well as being able to form additional boards from his body.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 1}}{{r|Annihilation: Silver Surfer Vol 1 4}} The board is psionically linked with the Surfer's mind in some unknown fashion, and it follows his commands instantly. It apparently taps cosmic energy in much the same fashion as the Surfer himself, and although the Surfer could theoretically use the power cosmic to fly without his board, the construct enables him to do so without expending any of his own energy. The Surfer generally limits his speed to Mach 10 (ten times the speed of sound) within the outer layers of a planet's atmosphere, can attain 99.99% the speed of light in regular space, and can exceed light-speed within hyperspace. The Silver Surfer is also able to trap living matter into his Surfboard for extended periods of time, or even destroy living matter within the board itself.{{Citation}}
