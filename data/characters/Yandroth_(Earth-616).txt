| History                 = Yandroth was an alien scientist who fought [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] on several occasions.{{r|Strange Tales #164}} Strange defeated Yandroth, sending him to seemingly fall forever through an alternate dimension.{{r|Strange Tales #168}}

There, he learned that he could gain great power by destroying a world. He constructed an 'Omegatron', which was defeated in the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defender]]'s first adventure.{{r|Marvel Feature #1}}

Omegatron menaced the Defenders a few more times. Later, Yandroth possessed a young girl in order to telepathically attack the heroes. He was seemingly killed in their last encounter.{{r|Defenders #119}} 

Although Yandroth was dead, his spirit was still capable of taking possession of a living human's mind. Taking the form of a vagrant, he was discovered by [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Patsy Walker]]. Seemingly an innocent, she rescued him, allowing him time to regain his strength and capture her.

He crafted a plan to end the world. He utilized the captured form of [[Gaea (Earth-616)|Gaea]], the spirit of the Earth, to summon monsters from all over, involving many superhero teams. Most of the New York-based heroes were tied up confronting destructive, mindless monstrosities; [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] was attacked by Warlord Kaa and his Shadow Warriors; a group of [[Living Eraser]]s appeared in the Tokyo Headquarters of the [[Big Hero Six (Earth-616)|Big Hero Six]]; [[Lizard Men of Tok|Lizard Men from Tok]] attacked the island nation of [[Genosha]]; and [[Gorgilla (Earth-616)|Gorgilla]] subdued the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] by dropping a building on them.

Patsy, who had escaped and learned this, told the Defenders, who were then comprised of [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]], the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], Doctor Strange, and [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]]. The superhero battles Yandroth had caused gave him enough power to summon the Ravagers of Creation. These four elemental creatures confronted the Defenders, who were unable to stop them individually. They attacked the Stone creature, disabling the spell needed to destroy the world. This freed Gaea and killed Yandroth. As he witnessed the Hulk and Namor fighting, he realized the Defenders hated each other. With his last breath, he used his powers to curse them, so they would be forced to work together in times of a severe crisis. This involved uncontrollable teleportation, affecting all four of the heroes.{{r|Defenders Vol 2 #1}}

Yandroth was later revived when the four Defenders became The Order for a short time and their curse rendered him all-powerful.{{r|The Order #5|6}} Not long after he became an enemy of the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|50-State Initiative]] [[Defenders (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Defenders]] team, manipulating many people throughout time in his vendetta against them and [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]] in particular, all to try and form a version of the Defenders that he believed should exist.{{r|Last Defenders Vol 1 1|6}}
