| History                 = '''Aldrif Doomsdottir''' was a member of the [[Thor Corps (Earth-15513)|Thor Corps]], [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doom]]'s enforcers of justice composed of multiple men and women from across [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]].

After dealing with some [[Homo sapiens|human]] extremists in the [[Monarchy of M]], she was struck by a bolt while flying the borders of [[Killville]].{{r|M.O.D.O.K. Assassin #1}} When she woke up, she then attacked [[George Tarleton (Earth-11131)|M.O.D.O.K.]] who was near her, thinking he was responsible for attacking her, but soon came to realize that he wasn't responsible and M.O.D.O.K. offered his assistance to find out who attacked her.{{r|M.O.D.O.K. Assassin #2}}

Suddenly, the [[Assassins Guild (Earth-11131)|Assassins Guild]] tried to attack both of them. Together, M.O.D.O.K. and Aldrif worked together to dispose of their would-be assassins, even succeeding when being overwhelmed. Afterwards, the [[Mindless Ones]] descended to the scene.{{r|M.O.D.O.K. Assassin #3}}

M.O.D.O.K. and Aldrif were able to evade the endless waves of Mindless Ones, at the cost of the lives of the remaining members of the Assassins Guild, who had become M.O.D.O.K.'s temporary allies. Upon reaching a safe zone, M.O.D.O.K. started putting together the different occurrences that happened to Aldrif, and concluded that the attack that struck her down, the force field that prevented her from reaching [[Mjolnir|her hammer]], and her cloaking against technology had been the work of [[Karl Mordo (Earth-11131)|Baron Mordo]]. The Mindless Ones caught up to M.O.D.O.K. and his companion, ultimately swarming him while Aldrif tried to go through the force field surrounding her hammer to recover it. The effort to disrupt the field knocked her out, while M.O.D.O.K. tried to kill Baron Mordo.{{r|M.O.D.O.K. Assassin #4}}

Aldrif eventually regained consciousness and killed [[Clea (Earth-11131)|Clea]], subsequently dealing with the rest of the Mindless Ones while M.O.D.O.K. defeated Mordo. The Thor Corps arrived soon after Baron Mordo's defeat, and in a fit of rage, the villain tried to attack the Thors, but was killed by M.O.D.O.K.. Aldrif defended M.O.D.O.K.'s actions against her fellow Thors, acknowledging M.O.D.O.K.'s help in saving her. Before leaving, M.O.D.O.K. tried to kiss Angela, but she rejected him, then informed [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Sheriff Strange]] of M.O.D.O.K.'s actions, and he was made Baron of Killville.{{r|M.O.D.O.K. Assassin #5}}

After this, Aldrif was sent by God Emperor Doom to deal with [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]], who had left the domain of [[Knowhere]] several times. Gamora was rescued alongside [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax]], who picked up a fight with Angela when she appeared asking for Gamora, by their fellow [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of Knowhere]] member, [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]], and the trio fled to [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]]' apartment.{{r|Guardians of Knowhere #1}}

Angela later arrived to deal with [[Yotat (Earth-616)|Yotat the Destroyer]] by striking the villain with a lightning bolt. Her intervention allowed Drax to recover and attack Yotat, weakening him enough a second attack from Angela finally defeated him. The [[Nova Corps (Earth-71535)|Nova Corps]] appeared on the scene to take Yotat into custody, as they had previously failed to subdue him during his first encounter with Drax. After Yotat was handed over the Nova Corps, Angela resumed her business with Gamora. Angela demanded Gamora provide an explanation for her heresy, as she did not view Doom as a deity. Gamora's failure to properly explain the reasoning behind her beliefs resulted in further confrontation, which was interrupted by the arrival of [[Hala (Earth-616)|a mysterious woman]] through a portal.{{r|Guardians of Knowhere #3}}

At first astonished by the woman's appearance, Angela and Gamora tried to communicate with her, but they didn't recognize her language. Despite Gamora saying to Angela to disarm herself in order to calm the warrior down, Angela didn't listen and they were attacked and defeated by her. The Nova Corps showed up soon after, and tried to take her down, but she overcame them, killing many of them in the process, before recognizing the [[Kree]] symbol on [[Carol Danvers (Earth-71535)|Captain Marvel]]'s chest. With the mysterious warrior distracted, Angela and Gamora stabbed her with their swords, seemingly killing her. Later, Angela tried to convince Gamora to stay in Knowhere and obey the laws created by Doom, but Gamora couldn't do it. As Gamora tried to explain her reasons to trespass to other domains, the believed dead mysterious woman rose once more and killed the Thor.{{r|Guardians of Knowhere #4}}
