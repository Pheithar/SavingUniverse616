| History                 = Like [[Earth-98120]]'s [[Melissa Gold (Earth-98120)|Songbird]], Captain Marvel was drawn to [[Earth-616|Reality-616]] by [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] to take part in the [[Destiny War]]. This was from a slightly different point in the 98120 continuum, Songbird having been taken from after a battle between the [[Avengers (Earth-98120)|Avengers]] and [[Oort (Earth-98120)|Oort]]'s [[Solar Squadron (Earth-98120)|Solar Squadron]], and Genis-Vell was taken while he was removing the corpse of [[Eon (Earth-98120)|Eon]] from [[Earth]]'s [[Sol|solar system]], having defeated a scheme by [[Ego (Earth-98120)|Ego the Living Planet]] with the aid of the Avengers. Both were returned to Earth-98120 at the conclusion of the Destiny War. They became a couple and eventually married sometime later, having two children together named [[Mimi-Vell (Earth-98120)|Mimi]] and [[Ely-Vell (Earth-98120)|Ely-Vell]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 20}}

Later, when [[Morlun (Earth-001)|Morlun]] was hunting the [[Multiverse]] for [[:Category:Spider Hybrids|Spider-Totems]], he dropped into Earth-98120 to kill [[Miguel O'Hara (Earth-98120)|Spider-Man]]. Genis tried to stop him. Morlun sucked the cosmic energy from Genis, leaving him weak and defeated. After Miguel was killed, Morlun left that universe, leaving [[Steven Rogers (Earth-98120)|Captain America]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-98120)|Wolverine]] to take Genis to medbay and wonder who it was that had attacked and killed Miguel.{{r|Spider-Man 2099 Vol 2 5}}
