| Overview                = The symbiote known as '''Tyrannosaurus''' was extracted from the [[Symbiote Dragons|symbiote-dragon]] code-named [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]] and bonded to a soldier named [[Rex Strickland (Earth-616)|Rex Strickland]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. Under the influence of the dark god [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], Tyrannosaurus rampaged across Vietnam but was inspired by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]] and Rex's nobility to break free of Knull's control. When Rex was killed by a [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] [[Life-Model Decoy]], Tyrannosaurus assumed his identity and became an agent of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], coincidentally assigned with hunting itself down.{{r|Venom Vol 4 1}}{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam Vol 1 1}} Years later, Tyrannosaurus tracked down [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]] - the current host of the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]] - and recruited him to rescue the other Sym-Soldiers. Unfortunately, its plans backfired and the Grendel resurfaced again, forcing Tyrannosaurus to bond to Eddie and ultimately sacrifice itself in an attempt to stop Knull from being unleashed; with only [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a sample of the Grendel]] surviving.{{r|Venom Vol 4 1|6}}

Tyrannosaurus was reunited with Rex's [[Glossary:Symbiote Codex|codex]] in the Symbiote Hive-Mind, and during Knull's [[King in Black (Event)|invasion]] they recruited [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Anti-Venom]] and the newly-deceased Eddie to stop Knull from within the Hive-Mind. Breaking into the Hive-Mind's core, they freed a number of captured symbiotes -- enabling Flash to "download" his codex into a [[Symbiote Dragon]]. Before Eddie could follow, Knull seized contol of Tyrannosaurus to kill Eddie once again, with what became of Tyrannosaurus and Rex's codex afterward remaining unknown.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 31}}-[[Venom Vol 4 34|34]]}}

| History                 = 
===[[Vietnam War]]===
When the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel symbiote]] was excavated by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], samples of its living abyss were extracted and bonded to soldiers wounded in the [[Vietnam War]], forming a black-ops super-soldier initiative named the [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|Sym-Soldier Program]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 2}}

[[File:Rex Strickland (Earth-616) and Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Web of Venom Ve'Nam Vol 1 1 001.png|thumb|left|Bonded to Rex Strickland while under Knull's thrall]]

One of these offshoot symbiotes - codenamed "Tyrannosaurus" - was bonded to [[Rex Strickland (Earth-616)|Rex Strickland]]. Enraged by the experiments S.H.I.E.L.D. was performing on the symbiote-dragon in order to find a way to kill it, the Tyrannosaurus symbiote - under the influence of [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], the dark god who had created the symbiotes - seized control of its host and tried to corrupt him.{{r|Venom Vol 4 2}} For four mouths, Tyrannosaurus and its brethren prowled the jungles of Vietnam devouring any soldier they came across - Việt Cộng and American alike - until a Nick Fury [[Life-Model Decoy]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]] were dispatched to subdue them. The Tyrannosaurus symbiote separated from Rex and disguised itself as him in an attempt to catch Fury and Logan off-guard, but was exposed by Rex and briefly repelled. Upon returning with its brethren, it bonded to Logan but was quickly separated from him by Rex. When the LMD began counting down to self-destruct, the Tyrannosaurus symbiote - touched by Logan's compassion and influenced by Rex's nobility and inherit goodness - broke free from Knull's influence and bonded to him one last time, conveying regret for its actions. The Tyrannosaurus symbiote threw Logan to safety and tried to shield Rex from the ensuing blast, but failed.{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam Vol 1 1}}

===Modern Times===
[[File:Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 4 1 001.png|thumb|right|Posing as Rex Strickland]]
After the death of its host, the Tyrannosaurus symbiote emulated Rex's appearance and personality to assume his identity;{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}} becoming an agent of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] ironically assigned with hunting itself down.{{r|Venom Vol 4 1}}{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam Vol 1 1}} At some point, "Rex" began investigating [[Cult of Knull (Earth-616)|an ancient symbiote-worshiping cult]] dedicated to the revival of Knull, and realized he would need help to put a stop to them.{{r|Venom Vol 4 31}} To this end he attempted to recruit [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]] to save his cryogenically-frozen brethren after the collapse of S.H.I.E.L.D., but his intel on who was bonded to the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]] was outdated. "Rex" instead encountered [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]] and knocked him unconscious to prevent his rampaging symbiote from killing a pair of [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|police officers]]. Disappointed that he hadn't been able to recruit Flash, "Rex" nevertheless decided to make do with Eddie and passed him information on the [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|Sym-Soldier Program]], requesting his help to rescue his comrades in exchange for helping him fix his symbiote.{{r|Venom Vol 4 1}}

When Venom returned from the mission and revealed that he had failed and the Grendel symbiote had awakened, "Rex" realized that Venom was slowly succumbing to Knull's control and told him of what had transpired in Vietnam decades prior.{{r|Venom Vol 4 2}} When Venom returned from an encounter with Knull, "Rex" was forced to reveal its true form and apologized for the deception. While "Rex" initially despaired that it would be unable to stop Knull from assimilating it into the Grendel symbiote and rejoining it to the Hive, Venom asked for it to join him in taking the fight to Knull. "Rex" bonded to Eddie and amalgamated with the Venom symbiote, showing Venom an arsenal of weapons it had appropriated while an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}}

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616), Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616) and Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 4 6 001.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Bonded to Venom.]]

In order to prepare for the final battle, the augmented Venom armed himself with portable energy cannons, machine guns, and sonic grenades; before the Tyrannosaurus symbiote reconnected to the Hive Mind to summon Knull. When the Grendel symbiote attacked, the Tyrannosaurus symbiote destabilized it by feeding it a pair of sonic grenades, forcing Knull to manifest. The Tyrannosaurus and Venom symbiotes were ultimately separated from Eddie by Knull and absorbed into the Grendel symbiote. However, Eddie detonated the arsenal, and the Tyrannosaurus symbiote shielded the Venom symbiote from the blast so that it could return to Eddie. With Knull's avatar weakened, the Tyrannosaurus symbiote dragged its progenitor into the blast furnace, sacrificing itself in an attempt to immolate it.{{r|Venom Vol 4 6}}

===Legacy and Post-Mortem===
Unfortunately, all their efforts would be in vain, as [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a small piece]] would survive, and be bonded to the serial killer [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Cletus Kasady]]. Becoming Carnage once more,{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} he would go on [[Absolute Carnage|a rampage]] in order to get enough [[Glossary:Symbiote Codex|codices]] to awake Knull. He would succeed in his quest when Eddie impaled him with [[Glossary:Necrosword|a Necrosword]], Venom assimilating the Carnage-ized Grendel symbiote and [[Venom III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|the codices]]. With Knull awakened, he assimilated the Symbiotes symbiotes back into his dark Hive-Mind and resumed his conquest to destroy the cosmos.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5}}

Reunited with Rex Strickland in the symbiote afterlife at the bowels of the Hive Mind, the Tyrannosaurus symbiote helped him assemble a team of deceased hosts and their symbiotes to oppose Knull's imminent revival; and was eventually reunited with Eddie Brock after he was killed by Knull.{{r|Venom Vol 4 32}} Along with [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Flash Thompson]]'s codex, they found themselves in the God Hive. Flash took possession of a [[Symbiote Dragons|Symbiote Dragon]] in the real world, alerting Knull of their presence. He took possession of the Tyrannosaurus Symbiote as his avatar and engulfed Eddie in living abyss. What became of Rex and his symbiote in the hive is unknown.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 33}}-[[Venom Vol 4 34|34]]}}

I have been for a very long time.|[[Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Rex Strickland's Symbiote]]|Venom Vol 4 5}}

Under the influence of Knull's hive mind, the Tyrannosaurus symbiote was driven by insatiable bloodlust and ravenous hunger, devouring countless Việt Cộng and American soldiers alongside its brethren. While impersonating Rex Strickland, it expressed horror and revulsion at the carnage it and its brethren had wrought while berserk - though it is unclear whether this was genuine or an act intended to catch the Nick Fury LMD and Logan off-guard.{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam Vol 1 1}} Following the original Rex Strickland's death, it emulated not only his appearance but his personality;{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}} displaying a wry sense of humor and mocking Eddie Brock's lack of knowledge about the symbiotes.{{r|Venom Vol 4 1}} Despite being enraged by Nick Fury's callousness towards its kind and the murder of its host to cover up S.H.I.E.L.D.'s dark secrets,{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam Vol 1 1}} it refused to rejoin Knull's hive-mind - having been touched by the "light" of Rex's nobility - and agreed to work for S.H.I.E.L.D. Despite being afraid of being forcibly assimilated into Knull's hive-mind, the Tyrannosaurus symbiote displayed a veteran soldier's grit and determination while advising Eddie Brock, psychoanalyzing him in an effort to better understand the man it had allied itself with.{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}}
