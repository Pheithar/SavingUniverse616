| History                 = Not much is known about the past of Miss Diaz. At some point in her life, her own mother recruited her as an agent for [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]].

So she posed as a girl scout who was selling cookies on the streets. Miss Diaz successfully kidnapped Agent Madrox, but he was in fact [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Madrox Prime]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 14}}

Miss Diaz was present as [[Doctor Locke (Earth-616)|Doc Locke]] mentally tortured Madrox and was later most likely killed in a crushing crowd after Madrox created more and more dupes after slapping his own face for a few times.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 15}}
