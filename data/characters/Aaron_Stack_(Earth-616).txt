| History                 = ===Origins===
Scientists working for a top-secret U.S military project worked on creating an army of 51 experimental robotic soldiers capable of acting like humans. Their goal was to create a sophisticated weapons system capable of independent thought. [[Abel Stack (Earth-616)|Dr. Abel Stack]] took X-51, one of the the projects robots, home to test his radical theory--that a robot could only function like a human if it was raised like one. The other 50 models began displaying psychotic tendencies due to insufficient programming. The project was determined a failure and the order came down to destroy them. Each of the robots was equipped with an auto-destruct device that could be triggered remotely. Stack managed to remove the self-destruct mechanism from X-51, but figured he couldn't dispose of the bomb before it exploded, and urged Aaron to leave him. X-51 vowed that Stack's dream of human and robot peace would come true.{{r|2001, A Space Odyssey Vol 2 8}}

[[File:Aaron Stack (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 7 0001.jpg|left|thumb|Machine Man]]

As Machine Man, X-51 assumed the name Aaron Stack and became a fugitive in the eyes of the military. He found a world greatly afraid of machines, but managed to blend in without suspicion.{{r|2001, A Space Odyssey Vol 2 9}} Mr. Hotline dispatched a suicide bomber to hold Aaron's friends hostage in order to get him to return to the Hades Organization HQ where technicians dismember X-51 and present his head to the Monitor, a computer that projects a Satanic hologram. The Monitor searches Aaron's mind for the anti-life equation, but before he can prep a second assault Machine Man orders his limbs to reassemble and he re-programs the computer to neutralize the bomber and free his friends.{{r|2001, A Space Odyssey Vol 2 10}}

===Superhero Career===
After being captured and later freed, Machine Man was found by psychiatrist [[Peter Spalding (Earth-616)|Dr. Peter Spalding]]. He also battled [[Joseph Kragowski (Earth-616)|Colonel Kragg]]'s troops.{{r|Machine Man #1|5}} Soon after that, he first encountered [[Curtiss Jackson (Earth-616)|Power Broker]].{{r|Machine Man #6|9}} Alongside the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], he battled the Power Broker.{{r|Incredible Hulk #234|237}} Soon after that, he was redesigned and rebuilt by [[Oliver Broadhurst (Earth-616)|Dr. Oliver Broadhurst]].{{r|Machine Man #10|14}} He then first encountered the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|Machine Man #15}} He then met mechanic "Gears" Garvin, and then battled [[Walther Theodoric (Earth-616)|Baron Brimstone]].{{r|Machine Man #16}} He also battled [[Sunset Bain (Earth-616)|Sunset Bain]].{{r|Machine Man #17}} He then first encountered [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]].{{r|Machine Man #18}} Spaulding and Garvin set up Machine Man with a human identity as Aaron Stack, insurance investigator for the Delmar Insurance Company, but he continued having adventures as a superhero on the side.{{r|Machine Man #19}}

While working with [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|The Thing]], Machine Man first met and fell in love with another sentient robot, [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]]. Alongside the Thing and Jocasta, he battled [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]].{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #92}} However, during the battle, Machine Man witnessed the seeming destruction of Jocasta by Ultron.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #93}}

Machine Man once tried to meet with [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], who he believed was a fellow robot. However Tony was very drunk, irate, and under considerable stress from the machinations of [[Obadiah Stane (Earth-616)|Obadiah Stane]]. He attacked Machine Man and almost killed two of his own employees, but Machine Man was able to rescue them.{{r|Iron Man #168}}

===Avengers===
After being held captive for months, the [[Super-Adaptoid (Earth-616)|Super-Adaptoid]] was freed by the [[Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|Fixer]] and set out to get his revenge on the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Avengers #287}} He first recruited the [[Awesome Android (Earth-616)|Awesome Android]] to his cause, and used the Fixer's brilliant technical mind to reprogram him. He then confronted Machine Man and offered to fix his long-lost love Jocasta if he would join his team.{{r|Avengers #288}} Machine Man accepted, and they went to the panhandle of [[Texas (State)|Texas]] and reprogrammed [[Sentry 459 (Earth-616)|Sentry]] and then the [[TESS-One (Earth-616)|TESS-One]] robot, adding them to the team. Heavy Metal then went to [[Hydrobase]] and attacked the Avengers who resided there, battling the [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]], [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]], [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], and [[Marrina Smallwood (Earth-616)|Marrina]].{{r|Avengers #289}} Unknown to the other members of the team, the Adaptoid was merely looking for information on the [[Cosmic Cube]]. He found the information he needed and summoned Kubik, a cosmic being that evolved from the cube. Meanwhile, the other members of the team began to lose one by one, except for Machine Man, who switched sides and joined the Avengers to fight the Adaptoid after he copied Kubik's powers and became almost omnipotent. The Adaptoid eventually lost the battle, and the androids and robots were sent to a secure location.{{r|Avengers #290}}

Machine Man again worked alongside the Avengers during a battle with [[Terminus (Destroyer) (Earth-616)|Terminus]].{{r|Avengers: West Coast Annual #5}}{{r|Avengers Annual #19}} When the Avengers reorganized their roster shortly thereafter, X-51 was nominated in absentia as a reservist for the West Coast Avengers.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #69}} He eventually accepted and was seen in action alongside his fellow reserve substitutes shortly after [[Operation: Galactic Storm]].{{r|Avengers: West Coast #83}}

===Machine Sentinel===
During an encounter between Cable and the humanoid Sentinel Bastion, X-51 was infected with Sentinel nano-technology and forced to serve Bastion. He reasserted his independence, but the Sentinel programming remained buried deep in his software.{{r|Cable / Machine Man Vol 1 '98}}{{r|Machine Man / Bastion Annual Vol 1 '98}} X-51 was then captured by [[Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who wanted to use his technology to create another [[Deathlok]], and was swept up into an [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] adventure where the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] took control of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]]. Machine Man helped ferry SHIELD agents to safety as the Helicarrier was being destroyed, but was seemingly destroyed himself in the process.<ref>[[Rage Against the Machine]] crossover.</ref>

As a last ditch effort at survival, X-51 transferred his consciousness from his failing body into the [[Jack Kubrick (LMD) (Earth-616)|Life Model Decoy]] of Agent [[Jack Kubrick (Earth-616)|Jack Kubrick]] which landed near him in the Helicarrier's wreckage. Aaron was so damaged in the crash, however, that his intelligence was subsumed beneath the LMD's programming, leading him to believe he actually was Jack Kubrick, searching for information on Machine Man.{{r|X-51 #1}}

[[File:X-51 Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|left|Aaron as the Machine Sentinel]]

The [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Mutants]], looking for weapons and devices, excavated the wreckage where X-51 had been lost. They confronted "Kubrick", also on scene, and blew his head off. The LMD's headless body collapsed near the inert original head of Machine Man. The two interfaced, bringing X-51 back online and letting him access the full power of his futuristic Sentinel tech, re-configuring the LMD body into a more powerful form. However, he was also now vulnerable to the Sentinel protocols, reverting to an aggressive mutant-hunting posture whenever in the presence of ''homo superior''.{{r|X-51 #2|8}} Machine Man's new status fascinated the [[Celestials (Race)|Celestials]], who sent a Monolith to observe him. The Monolith offered him a chance to accompany the Celestials, and he agreed.{{r|X-51 Vol 1 12}} Following X-51's departure, an [[Aaron Stack (Impostor) (Earth-616)|impostor]] surfaced, who apparently believed himself to be original Machine Man.{{r|Marvel Comics Vol 1 1001}}

| Abilities               = * He communicates well with humans, due to his upbringing and observations. After merging with the Jack Kubrick Life-Model Decoy, which was uploaded with a copy of Kubrick's mind, this gives Aaron any and all skills, knowledge, memories, and abilities possessed by the real Jack Kubrick.
| Strength                = * As Machine Man, Aaron could lift 2 tons and an extended limb could lift a few hundred pounds. As the Machine Sentinel, Aaron can now lift well beyond 100 tons.

| Weaknesses              = 

| Equipment               = * Himself. As a synthetic entity, Machine Man has a variety of built-in gear. This has been shown to include a gas chromatograph, laser interferometer, micro-pulse radar, audiometer, seismometer, gravity wave detector, pulse-code modulator, standard computer input/output, radio beacon, all-wave transceiver, and laser cutting torch. Formerly [[Avengers Identicard]].
| Transportation          = * Anti-gravity units, a propeller attachment to hover, formerly [[Quinjet|Avengers Quinjet]].
| Weapons                 = * Normally, his index fingers are loaded with pistol rounds. He can also switch out various devices and other weapons with items contained on his belt. After merging with the Prime Sentinel, Stack can adapt his weapons systems as needed.

| Notes                   = * Machine Man originally underwent a drastic appearance and personality change in {{cl|Nextwave Vol 1}}, being presented as aggressive and antisocial, also seeing humans with contempt. This personality carried on to the character's further appearances like {{cl|Marvel Zombies 3 Vol 1}}, {{cl|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1}} and {{cl|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2}}. The story "See What's Become of Me" in {{cl|Marvel Comics Vol 1 1001}} retconned this by establishing that that Machine Man was [[Aaron Stack (Impostor) (Earth-616)|an impersonator]]. It is not know if this retcon also accounts for the Machine Man that appeared in {{cl|Hulk Vol 2}} and {{cl|Red She-Hulk Vol 1}} who looked and behaved more similar to the original Machine Man rather than his ''Nextwave'' incarnation.
| Trivia                  = * The character and stories are based on the eponymous Stanley Kubrick film and Arthur C. Clarke novel.{{Citation}}
