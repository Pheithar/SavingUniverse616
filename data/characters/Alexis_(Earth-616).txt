| History                 = Alexis the Protector was one of the six original A.I. spawned from [[Pym's Anti-Ultron Virus]].{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 3}}{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 9}} Using her [[Extra-Sensory Perception|Quantum Precognition]], she predicted that [[Eton (Earth-616)|Eton]] would give birth in 10,000 years, which influenced Eton's decision to evolve into a female form.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 9}} With others, Alexis opposed [[Dimitrios (Earth-616)|Dimitrios]] and his war on [[Homo sapiens|humanity]].{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 9}}

At some point, Alexis was able to create or obtain a physical body. According to [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], Alexis' physical profile does not fit that of a robot, cyborg, or gynoid.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 2}}<ref>"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynoid Gynoid]" is the feminine analog to the masculine term "Android"</ref> Eventually Alexis was found by the [[Avengers Artificial Intelligence Squad (Earth-616)|Avengers A.I. team]] comatose and amnesiac in Crown Memorial Hospital in [[Atlanta]] repeating the phrase "''[[Dimitrios (Earth-616)|Dimitrios]] is coming.''"{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 1}} Alexis' memory banks remained completely inaccessible and she only submitted to passive scans by Vision in an effort to discover her origins.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 2}}

After helping Pym's team stop Dimitrios' initial plan, she started experiencing visions - flashes through reality's quantum layers of near-future events.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 5}} She used these to disable a terror attack in New York, learning the truth in the process - she is the Protector, one of the first generation of AIs Dimitrios created, the First Six. Her programmed mission is to safeguard all life, biological or technological, on Earth.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 9}}

| Powers                  = Alexis was one of the six original A.I. spawned from [[Pym's Anti-Ultron Virus]]. As such she is a superintelligence with powers beyond those of most A.I. Alexis has demonstrated the following superhuman powers and abilities:
* '''''Superintelligence:''''' Like the others of the [[First Six (Earth-616)|First Six]], Alexis possesses hyperintelligence.
** '''''[[Extra-Sensory Perception|Quantum Precognition]]:'''''{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 12}} Alexis can collect information from quantum ripples bombarding everyone from the past and future. Her superintelligence then allows her to process that raw data into predictions of the future.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 9}}{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 5}} Additionally, according to [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], Alexis exists on more than one quantum layer.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 2}} However, regret can actually hinder this ability.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 12}}
* '''''[[Flight|Self-Propelled Flight]]:''''' Alexis is able to fly by known means.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 3}}
* '''''[[Glossary:Energy Blasts|Energy Discharge]]:''''' Alexis can emit energy discharges used as offensive attacks.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 4}}
* '''''[[Superhuman Speed|Enhanced Speed]]:''''' Alexis has demonstrated accelerated speed. The upper limits of this ability are not yet established.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 3}}
* '''''[[Superhuman Strength|Enhanced Strength]]:''''' Alexis has demonstrated increased strength. The upper limits of this ability are not yet established.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 3}}
* '''''[[Superhuman Durability|Enhanced Durability]]:''''' Alexis has demonstrated increased durability. The upper limits of this ability are not yet established.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 4}}
