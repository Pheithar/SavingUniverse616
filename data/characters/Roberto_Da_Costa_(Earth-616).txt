===Early Life===
Roberto Da Costa is the son of Afro-Brazilian millionaire [[Emmanuel Da Costa (Earth-616)|Emmanuel Da Costa]] and his [[United States of America|American]] wife [[Nina Da Costa (Earth-616)|Nina]], an archaeologist. Roberto first manifested his superhuman [[Homo superior|mutant]] powers when, at the age of fourteen, he was playing in a championship soccer match for his school team in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Motivated by racial hatred, a boy named Keller and another member of the opposing team knocked Da Costa to the ground. The hot-tempered Da Costa retaliated by tackling Keller, who began brutally beating Roberto. It was then that, without being aware of what was happening to him, Da Costa first manifested his superhuman strength. His body and clothing temporarily turned black in the process, and he inadvertently hurled Keller away from him. Confused and frightened, Da Costa sought help, but both the other players and most of the spectators panicked and fled. However, his girlfriend, [[Juliana Sandoval (Earth-616)|Juliana Sandoval]], who had been watching the game along with Emmanuel, stood by Roberto in his time of need.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #4}}

===Professor X===
Roberto's powers came to the attention of [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]], the renegade [[White Bishop]] of the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)#Inner Circle Lineups|Inner Circle]] of the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]]. Pierce sought to murder any superhuman mutants he could find. [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Pierce's mercenaries]] failed to abduct Roberto, but kidnapped Juliana instead. The mutant [[Telepathy|telepath]], [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]], founder of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], had learned of Pierce's plan to kill Roberto and sent his colleague, [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]], and the young superhuman mutants, [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]] and [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Psyche]], to help Da Costa.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #4}} 

Roberto agreed to meet with Pierce's men in order to obtain Sandoval's release, but the mercenaries refused to free her and intended to kill both of them instead. During a fight, one of the mercenaries fired at Da Costa, who had returned to normalcy again, but Juliana leaped in front of Da Costa, taking the fatal bullet herself. Anguished with guilt that Juliana had died protecting him, Da Costa vowed to take vengeance on Pierce. Bobby joined Karma, Prof. Xavier, and another young mutant, [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]], in tracking down Pierce and they succeeded in defeating him.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #4}}

===New Mutants===
Roberto agreed to stay with Prof. Xavier and received training in the use of his superhuman powers as a member of the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]], even when it was later discovered that the Professor had originally created the team because he had been possessed by a [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] Queen egg inside of him seeking young mutants for future embryos. At the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], the New Mutants were tutored by Professor X and trained in the use of their powers in the [[Danger Room]]. A founding member of the New Mutants, Bobby was a mainstay of the junior team for most of its existence and became best friends with his teammate [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Samuel Guthrie (Cannonball)]].{{r|New Mutants #1|98}}

Meanwhile, Bobby’s father was contacted by the Hellfire Club and became a member of its secret Inner Circle under the alias of White Rook. He was the only person in the Inner Circle without superhuman powers. His performance in that role was almost unnoticed.{{r|New Mutants #23}} 

Sunspot and Wolfsbane were injected with the same drug that gifted [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] and [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] with their powers. Unable to control himself, Bobby attacked the X-Man [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] until the New Mutant [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] returned the powers to the original owners.{{r|New Mutants #23|25}}

[[Manuel de la Rocha (Earth-616)|Empath]] of the [[Hellions (Earth-616)|Hellions]] turned Bobby and his teammate [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]] over to the [[Gladiators (Earth-616)|Gladiators]], where they were forced to battle for entertainment by his former teammate Karma.{{r|New Mutants #29|31}} Later, during a trip to [[Asgard]], Bobby gained a job as security in a tavern. After lifting [[Volstagg (Earth-616)|Volstagg]] over his head, he befriended the [[Warriors Three (Earth-616)|Warriors Three]]. Bobby seriously entertained the idea of staying, as heroes were honored and worshiped in Asgard and he was hated and feared as a mutant on [[Earth]].{{r|New Mutants Special Edition #1}}

After their adventure in Asgard, the New Mutants found themselves under the guidance of a new teacher, [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], a fact that Bobby had a hard time dealing with. After reading Professor Xavier's personal files on himself, speculating that he could one day turn evil due to his arrogance, Bobby took a brief leave of the school.{{r|New Mutants #35|43}} 

While watching the Wildways, Bobby was captured by [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]] and [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]], and mentally controlled by [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] into joining a new show, the [[Bratpack (Earth-616)|Bratpack]]. After a brief battle with the New Mutants, Psylocke was freed from her mind control and freed the others as well. The New Mutants later battled the X-Men after they had been turned into the [[X-Babies (Mojoverse)|X-Babies]] by Mojo, until they were broken of their brainwashing and defeated the spineless one.{{r|New Mutants Annual #2}}

===Fallen Angels===
During a friendly soccer game, Bobby accidentally gave Sam Guthrie a concussion. Believing himself to be a danger to his team, Bobby ran away. After living on the streets, Bobby saved a runaway mutant called [[Chance (Fallen Angels) (Earth-616)|Chance]] from a group of thugs. When Bobby's powers failed, Chance abandoned him and fled with an alien girl called [[Ariel (Coconut Grove) (Earth-616)|Ariel]]. Bobby was rescued by [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]], who tried to convince Bobby to return to the New Mutants, but Bobby felt he was not worthy to rejoin the team and wished to be left a pariah. Warlock suggested that they stick together.{{r|Fallen Angels #1|2}}

Bobby decided to become a villain and rob a church, but found himself unable to go through with it. The pair were found by a duplicate of [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Jamie Madrox]] and [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]], who attempted to return them to the New Mutants. A cyborg called [[Alphonsus Lefszycic (Earth-616)|Gomi]] propositioned Bobby to join the [[Fallen Angels (Earth-616)|Fallen Angels]], a group primarily made up of adolescent mutant thieves organized by the mutant criminal called the [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]]. Among his recruits were the young mutant [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom Boom]], Gomi and his two cybernetically-enhanced lobsters [[Bill the Lobster (Earth-616)|Bill]] and [[Don the Lobster (Earth-616)|Don]], Chance, Ariel, the duplicate Madroxes, and Siryn.{{r|Fallen Angels #3|4}}

Vanisher teleported the Fallen Angels to the [[Valley of the Flame]] on [[Earth-78411|Dinosaur World]], where they were joined by [[Moon-Boy (Earth-78411)|Moon Boy]] and [[Devil Dinosaur (Earth-78411)|Devil Dinosaur]]. After Devil Dinosaur accidentally crushed [[Don the Lobster (Earth-616)|Don the Lobster]], Gomi spoke of not leaving friends after an accident or tragedy, which struck a cord with Bobby and he began to second-guess his decision to leave the New Mutants. After all of the mutants' powers temporarily went out-of-whack due to Chance, Ariel suggested that they all leave and teleported them to the [[Coconut Grove]], her home planet. The inhabitants of the Coconut Grove and the leader, [[Unipar (Earth-616)|Unipar]], captured the Fallen Angels, intending to experiment on them in order to continue their evolution, but the Angels worked together to defeat them and returned home.{{r|{{cl|Fallen Angels Vol 1 5}}-[[Fallen Angels Vol 1 8|8]]}}

===Returning to the New Mutants===
Bobby and Warlock returned to the New Mutants in time to aide them against [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]] and [[Right (Earth-616)|The Right]]. During the battle, [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Doug Ramsey]] jumped in the path of a bullet intended for Wolfsbane, killing him. Magneto ordered the children never to use their mutant powers without his permission, a fact that Bobby immediately defied and stated that Magneto didn't give them their powers and they could use them as they pleased.{{r|New Mutants #61}}

The mutants did not stay under the care of Magneto, as Cannonball and Mirage decided to move the team out from under Magneto's thumb. Magneto claimed the X-Men and the New Mutants were to be his army against the coming war between humans and mutants. He allowed the New Mutants to leave, however, stating that, in time, they would find his ways right and Bobby would be the first to join him. Bobby and the New Mutants were introduced to [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] and began to live on [[Prosh (Earth-616)|Ship]], merging with the [[X-Terminators (Earth-616)|X-Terminators]].{{r|New Mutants #74|76}}

===X-Force===
[[File:Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616) and Gideon (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 1 23 001.jpg|thumb|right|Sunspot confronts Gideon.]]
When his father died Bobby left the New Mutants and went with [[Gideon (Earth-616)|Gideon]], an old friend, to take over his father's business.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 98|99}} Gideon, however, was an immortal [[Externals (Earth-616)|External]] who had killed Bobby's father and was looking for the next External. Thinking that it was Sunspot, Gideon had Bobby subjected to various experiments that increased his solar absorption capabilities by 3000%.{{r|X-Force #1|15}} 

Meanwhile, [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] turned the New Mutants into [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] and Sam Guthrie was discovered to be the real External of the team. When Sunspot was liberated by X-Force, he found he had the ability to fire energy blasts from his hands.{{r|X-Force #16}}

Shortly after, during a battle with the [[Mutant Liberation Front (Earth-616)|M.L.F.]], Sunspot channeled his solar energy around his body, enabling him to fly. Unfortunately, he flew into one of [[Rayna Piper (Earth-616)|Locus]]' portal beams and was sent into the time-stream.{{r|X-Force #26|28}} It was thought that Sunspot had an alternate persona called [[Reignfire (Earth-616)|Reignfire]] who led the M.L.F., but it became clear that they were separate entities. After Bobby flew into Locus' beam, Reignfire captured him and forged a telepathic link that made Sunspot his puppet. When Cable forced his [[Clan Askani (Earth-4935)|Askani]] disciplines into Sunspot to "expunge" Reignfire, he severed that link and Bobby returned to normal.{{r|X-Force #43|44}} As a result of Cable's actions, Bobby was now fluent in Askani and gained finer control over his powers. He was so powerful that he found it hard not to be in his blacked-out "fiery-head" state, but he could power down using the Askani methods. In the final battle with Reignfire, Bobby was possessed by his nemesis, but eventually regained control of his body, and was stronger than ever.{{r|{{cl|X-Force Vol 1 78}}-[[X-Force Vol 1 80|80]]}}

While his best friend Sam Guthrie was with the X-Men, Bobby got closer to Sam's girlfriend [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Meltdown (Tabitha Smith)]]. Things progressed to the point where the teammates kissed, just in time for Sam to burst in and see them.{{r|X-Force #76}} This drove a wedge between the friends that didn't really heal, although they managed to work together when Sam rejoined X-Force.{{r|X-Force #84}}

===Hellfire Club===
Bobby was deported from the U.S. because his student visa was no longer valid since he was not a student anymore. He returned to [[Brazil]], to Rio de Janeiro and [[São Paulo]], but was restless and found the life of a rich playboy heir boring and meaningless. At that moment, [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]], who had usurped control of the Hellfire Club, approached Bobby and convinced him to help her stop the [[Deviants (Race)|Deviants]] in the [[Damocles Foundation (Earth-616)|Damocles Foundation]] from resurrecting a Celestial Template. Bobby agreed and met up with X-Force again during the battle. However, Selene didn't give up so easily and put Bobby through a number of illusory situations to force him to her side. Sunspot saw through all of them, so Selene and [[Blackheart (Earth-616)|Blackheart]], the new [[Black King]], played their trump card: Juliana Sandoval. Juliana was Bobby's girlfriend before his powers manifested. She was captured along with him by the Hellfire Club and she died to save him from being shot by a club goon. Blackheart told Bobby that Juliana was supposed to have lived, but someone in Processing messed up. The deal was: Bobby would join the Hellfire Club, and Juliana would get a new start in a recently deceased girl's body. Feeling that he owed his life to Juliana, Bobby had no choice but to accept, and left X-Force to become the third [[Black Rook]].{{r|X-Force #91|101}}

With [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]]'s resumption of the leadership of the Hellfire Club, Bobby appeared to have been released from his vow. Exactly what occurred and why Shaw would let Bobby get away is still unknown. Bobby then became the head of the [[Los Angeles]] [[X-Corporation (Earth-616)|X-Corporation]] branch, and was working with Empath to insure that mutant interests were taken care of.{{r|X-Treme X-Men #35}} For some reason, Bobby no longer used or had access to his energy-blasting and flight abilities, and now simply operated as "super-strong." In that capacity, Bobby helped [[Jon Spectre (Earth-4935)|Jon Spectre]] and a reconstituted X-Force battle the [[Skornn (Earth-4935)|Skornn]].{{r|X-Force Vol 2 #2|6}}

Bobby was again contacted by Shaw (and secretly by [[Sage (Earth-616)|Sage]]) and invited to join the [[Lords Cardinal]] as the Black King under Shaw, who sought the overarching position of Lord Imperial. However, Shaw's injury at the hands of Donald Pierce put Roberto in position to become Lord Imperial, with Sage as his primary adviser.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #452|454}}

As a result of the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]'s actions on [[Decimation|M-Day]], nearly all of the [[Homo Superior|mutants]] in the entire world were stripped of their powers. Bobby was one of the [[198 (Earth-616)|198]] who retained their powers. He retained his position as Black King of the Hellfire Club until Donald Pierce manipulated a team of [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]] into attacking him, believing him to be an enemy. When Pierce was defeated, Bobby became a teacher to these [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]] at the request of [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], before rejoining his former teammates and reforming the New Mutants.{{r|Young X-Men #2|12}}

===New Mutants X-Men Squad===
Magik later returned, stating that she was from the not too distant future and that the world and New Mutants would die without her intervention. Cyclops allowed Cannonball to reorganize the original New Mutants squad. Their first mission was to subdue a recently returned [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]]. After battling their resurrected teammate, Doug Ramsey, and the Hellions, Doug was freed from [[Eliphas (Earth-616)|Eli Bard]]'s control by Warlock wielding Magik's [[Soulsword]] and rejoined Bobby and the rest of his former teammates.{{r|{{cl|New Mutants Vol 3 1}}-[[New Mutants Vol 3 8|8]]}}

[[File:Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616) from Avengers World Vol 1 19 001.png|thumb|right]]
===Supreme Leader of A.I.M.===
After a [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|conflict between the Avengers and the X-Men]], Sunspot and Cannonball were some of the heroes that joined the ranks of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] as part of the team's plan to expand in numbers.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 2}} Their first mission involved rescuing the core Avengers team, who had been captured on [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]] by [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]] and [[Abyss (Ex Nihilo's) (Earth-616)|Abyss]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 3}} When [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]] decided to capture the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] for their clandestine activities, Bobby was unwilling to hunt down their friends, no matter what they had done. He left the Avengers, and once the fact that the Earth was in danger due to the [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]] was made public, decided to take action.{{r|Avengers World #17}} Roberto bought [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]],{{r|Avengers World #18}} and became their leader after forcefully kicking out the [[Andrew Forson (Earth-616)|Scientist Supreme]].{{r|Avengers World #19}} He subsequently used their resources to investigate the incursions from the [[Savage Land]]. Due to his progress, Bobby visited Cannonball on [[Chandilar]] and asked him to return to Earth.

Some of the Avengers who had left the team after Steve Rogers tasked them to hunt down the Illuminati joined Sunspot's [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|own Avengers team]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}} After helping diffuse the tensions between the Avengers and the Illuminati, Sunspot put A.I.M.'s resources into helping the other heroes investigate and try to prevent the end of the world.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 40}} When the incursion crisis reached an end, Sunspot set out to overhaul his company. Within eight months, Bobby removed any employee that posed a bad influence and re-branded his new company as [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|Avengers Idea Mechanics]], now located on the [[Hydrobase|Avengers Island]], with the purpose of helping the world, primarily by funding his New Avengers team.{{r|Avengers Vol 6 0}} Around this time, Roberto developed the disease known as [[M-Pox]], caused when a mutant entered in contact with any traces of the [[Terrigen]] cloud that was slowly being assimilated into the atmosphere. Bobby initially misled people into believing the M-Pox cost him his powers,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 4}} when in reality he maintained them, but at a much higher level than before, which caused him to age prematurely if he used them.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 17}}

===U.S.Avengers Unite===
A.I.M. underwent another rebranding when Da Costa made a deal with [[Robert Maverick (Earth-616)|General Maverick]] of the United States Army after a conflict involving hacktivist [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]], whom Da Costa provided with refuge, left A.I.M. in bad terms with [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 17}} A.I.M. was pardoned of the acts of war executed against S.H.I.E.L.D., and in turn became its intelligence division, turning into [[American Intelligence Mechanics (Earth-616)|American Intelligence Mechanics]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 18}} Sunspot began to lead the [[U.S.Avengers (Earth-616)|U.S.Avengers]] under the alias of [[Citizen V]].{{r|U.S.Avengers #1}}

[[File:U.S.Avengers Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
During the temporary takeover of the government by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s hand, Roberto was shot in the head with an energy pulse by a rogue A.I.M. agent.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 6}} The injury caused Roberto's powers to flare up, endangering his life. When he was imprisoned by Hydra, Roberto's cellmate and fellow U.S.Avenger [[Toni Ho (Earth-616)|Toni Ho]] managed to create a capacitor headband that regulated his powers.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 8}} Following Hydra's fall, the new Presidential administration attempted to fully take control of A.I.M. since S.H.I.E.L.D. had been dissolved. Roberto managed to save A.I.M. from this change of order by resigning from his position as Supreme Leader. Because the deal Bobby made with General Maverick concerned him personally, A.I.M. severed any ties with the government once Bobby left.{{r|U.S.Avengers #10}} Despite leaving the reins of A.I.M. to Toni Ho, Bobby remained as the leader of the U.S.Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 676}}

Shortly afterwards, Citizen V's team joined forces with the main Avengers team and the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]] due to a global crisis caused by a cosmic contest between two [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elders of the Universe]], the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] and the [[Challenger (Elder of the Universe) (Earth-616)|Challenger]], a game during which the [[Earth]] was teleported away from the Solar System.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 675}} Near the conflict's end, Roberto saw himself forced to switch off his regulator headband and use his powers to help keep a device named the [[World-Engine]] running, since it maintained the Earth's conditions and prevented the planet from crumbling.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 688}} This feat tentatively took many years off Bobby's life, so he decided to disband the U.S.Avengers and return to his roots since he didn't know how much time he had left, and rebranded himself as "Citizen X."{{r|Avengers Vol 1 690}}

===War of the Realms===
Somehow Roberto regained full control of his abilities and going by Sunspot again he helped the X-Men bring local civilians to [[Citi Field]] which was dubbed as Fort Syndergaard for safety. He teamed up with [[James Madrox (Bartender) (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]] against the [[Frost Giants]] where he ended up throwing a car at one of their heads killing it. Wolfsbane scolded Sunspot about how they needed to capture one of them to interrogate; Roberto responded in that fashion because he had seen a dead [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]] on the ground, not realizing that she duplicated Madrox's ability to make dupes. Soon afterward Sunspot and the others were ambushed by a group of [[Ice Hounds]] who were led by [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]]. Being in cahoots with [[Malekith (Earth-616)|Malekith]], Sabretooth chose Rahne to battle against while Sunspot was left to deal with the wolves. 
[[File:Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616) from War of the Realms Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 2 002.png|left|thumb|250px|Sunspot and the others vs. Ice Hounds]]
Getting the upper hand, Hope told Sunspot and the rest of the X-Men to fall back in order to regroup. This gave them enough time to be saved by Mirage and [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] who blasted all the hounds with a plasma burst causing Sabretooth to flee the scene. As Roberto received a hug from Karma, he told her that he has been with the group since leaving [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]] right after the invasion began. Sunspot wondered where Illyana was at but Karma responded that she thought Magik was with them. He replied that there was only five of them but when Roberto looked around, he noticed that Rahne went missing.{{r|War of the Realms: Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 2}}

After he was reunited with the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], and everyone was back including Magik, they wanted to use her magic. A magical stone prevented her from utilizing her abilities, a stone which Sunspot later found and attempted to grab. Though it supposedly did no harm, the stone seemingly caused Sunspot to explode in a fiery death. Mirage became aware of the ghosts surrounding them amongst the bodies of the fallen, including Sunspot. Before departing, he told her that he loved her and that she was practically his sister.{{r|War of the Realms: Uncanny X-Men #3}}

===Krakoa===
Following the foundation of a mutant state in [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] by the hand of Charles Xavier and his allies, Sunspot resurfaced as a citizen of the nation, having been presumably reborn by the hand of [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]], a group of mutants capable of combining their powers into a process of resurrection, brought together by Xavier as part of his plans for mutant ascension.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 1}}

* '''Solar Radiation Absorption:''' He can absorb solar energy and utilize it for physical strength. The cells of a normal human body convert energy from foodstuffs into a form of energy usable by the body. This energy is stored through converting molecules of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in the cells into adenosine triphosphate (ATP); the energy is released when necessary by breaking a chemical bond in the ATP molecules, converting them back to ADP. Apparently Sunspot can store solar-derived energy in his cells through the same, or a similar method, and release it when necessary to enhance his physical strength. His body is cloaked in darkness because he drains all the ambient light from his skin.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12}} 
* '''Solar Re-channeling:''' He possesses the ability to re-channel the solar energy which his body absorbs, by which he takes the solar energy and uses it for a variety of related purposes:
** '''FTL Flight:''' He possesses the ability to fly by propelling himself through the air, by force of will, by generating thermal updrafts. Bobby has also refined this ability to be able to hover in the air without leaving a heat trail, and can reach speeds of up to 150 mph maximum without overexerting himself. Reaching speeds of 750 mph in his over charged state.{{r|X-Force #28}} He can purportedly reach escape velocities by way of breaching planetary orbit and achieve space traversal.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 4}} 
** '''Enhanced Strength:''' When Sunspot's cells are powered by solar energy he has the superhuman ability to augment his physical strength. The original limits of his strength was that of 2 tons.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12}} Since then, however, his strength level increased to 50 tons.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}} Possibly more, as he was able to deck an alt. universe hulk, drawing blood from him while landing single blow.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 28}} Presently, Sunspot's strength has increased to uncontrollable levels as a side effect of his M-Pox infection.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 #17}} During the game between the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] and the [[Challenger (Elder of the Universe) (Earth-616)|Challenger]], Sunspot considered himself to be the strongest mutant on Earth, but using that much power would eventually be lethal to him.{{r|Avengers #688}} Ever since his resurrection, Sunspot's powers not only seem to've stabilized but metastasized in odd ways. Once boasting of how he was stronger than majestor Gladiator of the Shi'Ar and proving some merit to his claim by temporarily restraining him as he and the New Mutants battled it out with his Imperial Guard.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 #7}}
** '''Enhanced Speed:''' Fast enough to catch a speeding lancet thrown back at Deathbird by Kallark.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 #7}}
** '''Enhanced Reflexes:''' Quick in intercepting return fire from Gladiator after the majestor had hurled Cal'syee's own spear back at her.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 #7}}
**'''Enhanced Agility:''' Roberto has greater agility, balance, dexterity, flexibility, equilibrium and bodily coordination than that of an Olympic-level athlete. He is able to avoid energy beams in a death trap room using his Danger Room training in his day as an X-Men and did it in human form.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 14}}
** '''Enhanced Durability:''' Sunspot is one of the interesting powerhouses of the Marvel Universe due to the fact that he is one of the only ones that does not have heightened invulnerability. During many of the comics that Sunspot was seen in his teammates would remind him that he was super strong but not super durable. Although Sunspot has not been seen able to deflect bullets, his limited durability does provide his body the needed protection to be able to lift the massive weight that his super strength allows him to. However, this appears to have been contradicted as he has taken a bomb blast from a device latched onto his side and come out of it unscathed,{{r|Avengers World #18}} taken blows from [[Isabel Kane (Earth-616)|Smasher]] with some discomfort,{{r|Avengers World #14}} survived a laser blast to the face from the A.I.M scientist supreme and endure the rigors of interplanetary traversal without suffering ill effects.{{r|Avengers World #19}}{{r|Hulk Vol 3 4}} 
** '''Thermokinesis:''' Ability to project heat in intense waves when he absorbs and re-channels solar energy from any part of his body to raise the temperature. Roberto can also absorb heat into his body to lower the temperature in his immediate area. He can also project and absorb heat directly into/from people, causing intense discomfort over their fluctuating body temperatures.{{r|{{cl|X-Force Vol 1 78}}-[[X-Force Vol 1 80|80]]}}
** '''Photokinesis:''' Sunspot has the underlying ability to project, drain and cast light as intense waves from absorbing and re-channeling solar energy, as well as ambient EM wavelengths. To the extent of which is unknown but he is able enough to use this facet of his powers to nullify photon waves from the scientist supreme of A.I.M. and deal a laser emission back with nearly double the force.{{r|Avengers World #19}}
** '''Thermokinetic Concussive/Energy Blasts:''' During Sunspot's time with X-Force he was kidnapped by a supervillain named Gideon who performed various experiments on him. Gideon exposed Sunspot's body to massive amounts of solar energy in order to test the limits of his solar absorption. After these experiments Sunspot's body was overloaded with solar energy and he later gained the ability to fire blasts of heat and concussive force.{{r|X-Force #19}} 
** '''Dark Solar Plasma Blasts:''' He has the ability to project concussive dark plasma energy blasts from his hands, with about 20 tons of force behind them at their most powerful.{{r|X-Force #44}} 
** '''Energy Absorption:''' Da Costa can absorb various forms of energy available to him beyond just sunlight in order to bolster himself even further, even drawing upon and distilling the harmful effects of a laser blast.{{r|Avengers World #20}} He also successfully drew upon the energies of the resurrected Abomination who had been altered to emit vast quantities of Gamma Radiation.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 4}}
** '''Self-Sustenance:''' While in transformed state, Da Costa uses his energy abilities to provide nourishment for himself, allowing him to survive out in the cold of deep space. Using the self sustain ability he can heal himself with the energy he absorbs. {{r|Hulk Vol 3 4}}
** '''Fire and Heat Immunity:''' As is the norm with most pyrokinetics, Sunspot is immune to all forms of heat and fire as they simply add to his abilities and his mutant metabolism is able to simply convert these two forms and augment his abilities. This includes heat powers that are directed at him as well as heat that is present because of weather conditions. Sunspot has also been seen with the ability to absorb the energy that fire gives off and has remained unharmed while walking through it.{{r|{{cl|X-Force Vol 1 79}}-[[X-Force Vol 1 80|80]]}}

| Abilities               = '''Trained Martial Artist:''' As part of the X-Men, Sunspot has been trained by the likes of Wolverine and other mutants in combat. Since joining the Avengers, Sunspot received further training. He's further honed his skills by fighting/training against strong opponents such as Captain America, Black Panther, and Daredevil. Sunspot has become a very skilled fighter, by training with the X-Men and Avengers.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}} He has also trained in the Brazilian martial art of Capoeira.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 14}}

'''Athlete:''' Roberto is a very skilled soccer player, and used to play for his high school soccer team.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #4}}

'''Businessman:''' Since becoming the CEO of Da Costa International, Roberto has developed skills for business and finance.{{r|X-Force #1}} Professing of being a super-powered billionaire in his own right.{{r|Avengers World #19}}

'''Multilingual:''' Roberto speaks English, Spanish, and is fluent in Portuguese. He is also fluent in the future language of the Askani.{{r|X-Force #50}}

'''Skilled Tactician:''' Following his acquisition of A.I.M., Roberto has shown to be a proficient tactician, being able to turn a ploy of the [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]] to take over A.I.M. against the villain himself, through misdirection, and exploiting the flaws in the Maker's own plans.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 12|17}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Weaknesses
| body  = '''M-Pox:''' Suffering under the effects of the mutant-killing Terrigen Cloud, Roberto suffered from chronic coughing fits as a sign of the [[M-Pox]]. Although he initially misled people into believing the M-Pox cost him his powers,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 4}} Da Costa maintained his mutant abilities at a much higher level than before, but using them caused him to age prematurely.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 17}} Ever since his death in the War of Realms and resurrection in Dawn of X, Roberto has been seen using his powers without a regulator or fear of his M-Pox sickness.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 #7}}

Sunspot would quickly exhaust his energy if he was not in direct sunlight. This no longer applies to his current state. With his increasing age and experience, he has become able to absorb sunlight even at night if there is a moon, as moonlight is nothing but refracted sunlight.{{r|Fallen Angels #2}}

* According to original character designs by [[Bob McLeod]], Roberto was supposed to be of African/Portuguese descent, another variant for his alias was Solarus and he was supposed to grow to 10' when using his powers. He also had a second design for his powered state that was later used for [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]].{{r|X-Men: Archives Sketchbook Vol 1 1}}
