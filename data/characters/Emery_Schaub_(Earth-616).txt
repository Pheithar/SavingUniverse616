===Early Life===
'''Emery Schaub''' was employed as a fry cook in his hometown [[Morganton]], [[North Carolina (State)|North Carolina]], through unknown means, he gained complete invulnerability and was drafted into the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] program, taking the name '''Boulder'''.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}

===50-State Initiative===
====Difficult trainee====
He was taken to [[Camp Hammond]], along with [[Alexander Ellis (Earth-616)|Annex]], [[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Prodigy (Richard Gilmore)]], [[Andrea Roarke (Earth-616)|Sunstreak]], [[Fahnbullah Eddy (Earth-616)|Gorilla Girl]] and [[James Santini (Earth-616)|Batwing]]. There, he was met with mixed reactions from his fellow new recruits, who found his fan-boyishness, enthusiasm and overly positive attitude somewhat obnoxious and grating. He was quickly able to befriend Batwing though.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}

He was often looked down upon by the staff, especially [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] who immediately changed his code-name to '''Butterball''' upon his arrival.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}

He rubbed Taskmaster the wrong way as, while his power of total invulnerability was impressive and he was an enthusiastic and dedicated trainee, his lack of physical strength, skill, and wits made him an inappropriate candidate for the superhero program. Much to the frustration of Taskmaster, no amount of training improved Schaub's physical strength and no amount of discipline modified his behavior or attitude. His powers and attitude pushed the others trainees to peer pressure him. On one occasion, his teammates Sunstreak, Prodigy and Annex whipped him with rags; Batwing was the only one in their group who refused. Batwing was amused by the fact Butterball was unharmed and didn't even wake up during the beating attempt. Butterball soon ended up being slowly isolated from his peers.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}

Taskmaster was desperate by that point, but neither [[Criti Noll (Clone) (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]] or [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] accepted his request to get rid of such a useful power set. War Machine proposed to use the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]], the [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]] and Sumo wrestlers to train him, but Taskmaster reminded them that those guys had strength- Emery did not. Yellowjacket suggested that a near-starvation diet might have some effect- after two or three years. Taskmaster refused to admit failure and put Butterball on a strict diet of vegetables and tofu.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}

====Skinny-dipping====
Following a press conference where [[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Prodigy]] un-enthusiastically declared his backing of the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], Annex led his fellow new recruits, Schaub included, on an unauthorized trip off base, using Schaub as a human shield in order to escape while protected from the base security systems.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}

While the other members of the group went skinny-dipping, [[Andrea Roarke (Earth-616)|Sunstreak]] made a pass at Schaub. Sunstreak's heat generating powers prevented her from close physical contact with others, but Schaub's powers made him invulnerable to her heat, and as such, suitable for an intimate relationship. Unfortunately for Schaub, one side effect of his power was that he couldn't feel anything. He became upset that Sunstreak only wanted to use him and was unconcerned with the fact that he wouldn't physically enjoy it and decided to leave. On his way back to the base, Schaub was met by the staff members who had gone out after the missing recruits. Much to his teammates' surprise, who were afraid Schaub would squeal on them, Schaub took the entire blame for the incident. He explained his riding on the car hood by claiming he had put a cinderblock on the gas pedal, and had gone to have something else to eat other than vegetables and tofu.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}

Just then, four super-villains, [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mr. Hyde]], [[Klaus Voorhees (Earth-616)|King Cobra]], [[Brendon Doyle (Earth-616)|Mauler]] and [[Russell Broxtel (Earth-616)|Firebrand]], attacked in an attempt to kill Taskmaster, but the Initiative won handily when Mauler tried to take Schaub hostage and threatened to kill him, unaware of of his invulnerability, which the instructors demonstrated by firing without concern at him after he unsuccessfully shot Butterball in the head, Mauler's teammates then fled.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}

====Washed out====
After the group returned to the base, it was decided that, due to Schaub's inability to increase his strength, he couldn't be taught any effective fighting skills and would have to be washed out of the program. [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] assured him full Registration privileges and that he had a bright future in many fields of work, including search-and-rescue and hostile environment exploration.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}

His fate was envied by his promotion colleagues, who wished to be washed out as well, and Batwing asked him to keep contact with them. On his way out, [[Frank Schlichting (Earth-616)|Constrictor]] and Taskmaster, in a thank-you for his help against the villains, posed for a picture that made it appear as if Schaub had beaten both of them unconscious. He posted this picture in his room and told his mother that Camp Hammond was the best time of his life.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}

===Shadow Initiative===
[[File:Shadow Initiative (Earth-616) from Avengers The Initiative Vol 1 26 001.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Enthusiastic Butterball]]
After [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] took control of the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] and relocated it to [[Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.]], a former [[Hulkbuster Base]] in [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]], Schaub was recruited into the [[Shadow Initiative (Earth-616)|Shadow Initiative]]. In the meantime, he hadn't lost his fanboy habits, and asked for an autograph from the [[Keith Kraft (Earth-616)|Ringer]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #26}}

====The Taking of [[Prison 42|42]]====
The Shadow Initiative, now a team of expandable superhumans, was sent to [[Prison 42]] in the [[Negative Zone]] to fight [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]] and his forces in order to take back the prison. They were promised by Taskmaster to be soon joined by the "big guns", but were in fact sent in first to soften up Blastaar's army for the superhumans deemed more valuable.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #27}}

Schaub naturally was used as a shield by his teammates. He of course survived, but was traumatized by the deaths of teammates [[Firearms (Earth-616)|Firearms]], [[Slaughter Boy (Earth-616)|Slaughter Boy]] and [[Jonathan Logan (Earth-616)|Johnny Guitar]]. 

He contacted Taskmaster for reinforcements, and consequently learned that they were in fact cannon fodder. With the assistance of [[Roger Brokeridge (Earth-616)|Hardball]], an inmate, and the arrival of the promised big guns ([[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Penance]], [[Frank Payne (Earth-616)|Constrictor]], [[Arthur Parks (Earth-616)|Living Laser]], [[Steven Hudak (Earth-616)|Scorcher]]), the facility was retaken.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #27}}	

====Aftermaths====
[[File:Avengers The Initiative Vol 1 28 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Propaganda figure]]
Butterball was subsequently used as a propaganda figure, and surprisingly received lot of support from middle America people. Osborn stated that it was because he was ''"'''fat''' and '''stupid''', just like '''them'''"''.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #28}}

During the attack of the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|Avengers Resistance]] on Camp H.A.M.M.E.R. in order to free [[Donyell Taylor (Earth-616)|Night Thrasher]], Butterball was unable to wake up and take his post.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #29}}

===[[Siege (Event)|Siege]]===
As most of the [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] and Initiative were heading at [[Asgard]], [[Oklahoma (State)|Oklahoma]], the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|Avengers Resistance]] attacked [[Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.]], all of the Stark's Initiative members were confined to quarters by the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #33}} As [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Penance]] freed himself, smashing his cell and the noise was heard by Butterball, [[James Santini (Earth-616)|Batwing]] and [[Duc No Tranh (Earth-616)|Bengal]] who left their quarters. This last wanted to take a role in the action, but Butterball intended to stick to the guards' instructions, until Penance showed up, convincing him to join Avengers Resistance fight against the [[Norn Stone]]-powered Shadow Initiative. They made explode the building, and presented their resignation to the Hood before joining the brawl. Butterball himself battled [[Badd Axe (Earth-616)|Badd Axe]], helping [[Greer Grant (Earth-616)|Tigra]]. As [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] took back control of the stone's power to power [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]'s allies, the Avengers Resistance was able to easily defeat the troops of Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #34}}

===[[Heroic Age]]===
[[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] was defeated, the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] repealed, and Butterball and Batwing went to the former's hometown, [[Morganton]], and created their [[Batwing and Butterball's Team (Earth-616)|own team]] in order to replace the disgraced and incarcerated [[U-Foes (Earth-616)|U-Foes]] in the role of [[North Carolina (State)|North Carolina]] protectors.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #35}}

During that period, they were the only initial members, of that team.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #3}}{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #35}}

In his [[Heroic Age: Heroes Vol 1 1|files]], [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]] repeated War Machine's statement about Butterball having a role in search-and-rescue and hazardous environment exploration. He didn't see Butterball as qualified for active duty with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], but still considered him to be a potential asset for specific missions.{{r|Heroic Age: Heroes #1}}

A dance was held in the [[Infinite Avengers Mansion]] for the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]] students, and other teen or young adult heroes were invited, including the [[Young Allies (Modern) (Earth-616)|Young Allies]] and some former members of the Initiative, and Butterball enjoyed himself on the dance-floor with [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat]]. When [[Madeline Berry (Earth-616)|Veil]] informed her that Butterball was invulnerable and so unexpected to be harmed by her radiations, which caused the former to be upset about the fact that the people immune to her powers weren't good-looking, causing an argument with [[Ken Mack (Earth-616)|Mettle]] and leading them to a relationship. Emery seemed to particularly enjoy the party, which ended with a battle between [[Roger Brokeridge (Earth-616)|Hardball]] and [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Speedball]]'s telekinetic bubbles.{{r|Avengers Academy #13}}

===[[Fear Itself]]===
[[File:50-State Initiative (Earth-616) from Fear Itself Youth in Revolt Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|330px|right|Assisting to [[Washington, D.C.]] [[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Prodigy]] speech]]
About one week later,{{r|Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt #1}} when [[Worthy|magical hammers]] crashed to [[Earth]], [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Commander Steve Rogers]] asked Butterball's former teammate [[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Prodigy]] to gather heroes on a volunteer basis, to help keep the peace by leading a new Initiative without forced conscription or registration. He gathered the heroes for a meeting at [[Washington, D.C.]], among them Butterball and Batwing.{{r|Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt #1}}

Soon afterward, he was on the field, dealing with riots and drawing fire by having projectiles thrown at him instead of others who were more vulnerable.{{r|Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt #1}}

He was among the heroes dispatched to [[Las Vegas]] to deal with the impact of earthquakes caused by a brawl between [[Roger Brokeridge (Earth-616)|Hardball]] and [[Greg Willis (Earth-616)|Gravity]], but he wasn't of much use. He was seen looking disoriented, standing still and stating he had always wanted to go to Vegas while the other heroes struggled with the quakes and strove to save themselves, their teammates or civilians.{{r|Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt #5}} When the [[Heavy Hitters Hotel and Casino]] fell, he was buried under it, and found a few days later in the ruins, safe but seemingly shocked.{{r|Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt #6}}	

===[[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]]===
[[File:Avengers Academy (Earth-616) from Avengers Academy Vol 1 20 0001.jpg|thumb|220px|Arriving on the new [[Avengers Compound|campus]]]]
In the aftermaths of that crisis, Butterball, Batwing and many other heroes were recruited by [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]] into the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]] which was relocated to the [[Avengers Compound]], former headquarters of the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avenger]].{{r|Avengers Academy #20}} Butterball was one of the part-time students.{{r|Avengers Academy #21}}

Along with his teammates, he was present to witness Jocasta's body after she was seemingly "murdered",{{r|Avengers Academy #21}} and was here to witness as well the arrival of [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] who came to help to solve the crime.{{r|Avengers Academy #22}}

He seemed to have a great time at the Avengers Academy,{{r|Avengers Academy #21}}{{r|Avengers Academy #24}} hanging out with other students.{{r|Avengers Academy #23}}

After the arrival of [[James Marks (Earth-616)|Hybrid]] at the Compound, he proposed to play the new "Crystar, the Crystal Warrior" video game with [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-616)|Reptil]] who was possessed by his [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-11511)|older self]] and was helping Hybrid in his evil plans. His goal was to leave the timeline and the [[Earth-11511|future]] unchanged so his [[Maria Lopez (Earth-11511)|daughter]] would be born. He consequently oriented Butterball to Hybrid, telling him he was a big fan of that video game, for him to capture and fed on Butterball. Hybrid was thrilled by the potential of Emery, whom he stated to be immortal and that he could feed off him forever.{{r|Avengers Academy #24}} When Hybrid was forced to attack the Academy, Butterball was one of the Avengers who kept floating around for him to feed and not of those mind-controlled to battle their teammates, until a magical backlash of [[Ava Ayala (Earth-616)|White Tiger]]'s [[Amulets of Power|amulet]] allowed him and the other to free from Hybrid's control and to join the fight against him.{{r|Avengers Academy #25}}

Instants later, the campus was visited by [[Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616)|Jeremy Briggs]] and the [[Briggs Chemical LLC (Earth-616)|Briggs Foundation]] heroes, intending to shut down the Academy. At Briggs' proposal, Butterball refused, astonished that some people with hero potential might prefer be and act as normal persons.{{r|Avengers Academy #26}}

===[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]===
After the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]]-[[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|powered]] [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] came to the Avengers Compound to destroy [[Juston Seyfert (Earth-616)|Juston]]'s [[Sentinel (Juston) (Earth-616)|Sentinel]], [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Giant-Man]] and [[Greer Grant (Earth-616)|Tigra]] decided to shut down the Avengers Academy for the duration of the [[Avengers vs. X-Men]] conflict, and gave a speech, which Butterball assisted.{{r|Avengers Academy #33}}

He rejoined the Academy at some time after it reopened.{{r|Avengers Arena #13}}

===Helping the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]]===
In order to battle [[Mother (Interdimensional Parasite) (Earth-TRN287)|Mother]], [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|Prodigy (David Alleyne)]] called for [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Transonic]] and [[Alexander Power (Earth-616)|Alex Power]] and more reinforcements, including [[Abigail Boylen (Earth-616)|Cloud 9]] who contacted Butterball.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 11}}

He battled among the ''"Thin Spandex Line"'' in [[Central Park]], against hordes of alternate [[Young Avengers]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 13| credits}} It is unknown if he attended to the [[Young Avengers Vol 2 14|after/New Year party]].<ref>He wasn't seen in {{cl|Young Avengers Vol 2 14}} or {{cl|Young Avengers Vol 2 15|#15}}</ref>

| Powers                  = '''Immutability/Invulnerability/Immortality:''' Butterball is invulnerable to numerous forms of physical harm; being shot at, blown up, burned, drowned, electrocuted, etc., along with psychic attacks, allow his body to nullify the effects of others powers against him. He once withstood being whipped with rags by [[Alexander Ellis (Earth-616)|Annex]], [[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Prodigy (Richard Gilmore)]] and [[Andrea Roarke (Earth-616)|Sunstreak]] while sleeping, without even waking up.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}} It was stated that he was also immune to [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat]]'s radiations,{{r|Avengers Academy #13}} though it wasn't demonstrated. If a weakness exist, it still hasn't been found.{{r|Heroic Age: Heroes #1}}

It was also speculated by the [[Earth-11511|future]] [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-11511)|Reptil]] that Emery would live forever and never get old. [[James Marks (Earth-616)|Hybrid]] confirmed that statement, stating that he ''"does not die! I can feed off him '''forever'''"''.{{r|Avengers Academy #24}}

That invulnerability come with a few other powers and characteristics:
* '''''Superhuman Stamina/Modified Metabolism:''''' Due to a metabolism different from normal humans, he is stuck in his shape, and doesn't get tired of performing actions available to him: For example, he can run all day without breaking a sweat, albeit slowly. He also can not get drunk. It was speculated that a near-starvation regime could made him lose weight after a couple of years,{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}} but [[James Marks (Earth-616)|Hybrid]] stated while controlling him that he could feed off him forever,{{r|Avengers Academy #24}} hinting that Emery is immortal and would seemingly never lose weight. While his strength is minimal his endurance is virtually inexhaustible. While lifting 150 pounds would be impossible, he could easily lift and carry 150 one pound objects consecutively without tiring.
* '''''Selective Telepathic Immunity:''''' Emery was even stated to be protected from being harmed by telepaths, but still vulnerable to mind control.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}} However, that statement of [[Criti Noll (Clone) (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]] was proven partly wrong as [[James Marks (Earth-616)|Hybrid]] was able to not only control him but also to cause him "spiritual" pain.{{r|Avengers Academy #24}}
* '''Impaired Sense of Touch/Selective Pain Suppression:''' As he is invulnerable and has an impaired sense of touch, he was thought to be insensible to pain, but [[James Marks (Earth-616)|Hybrid]] was still able to cause him "spiritual" pain.{{r|Avengers Academy #24}} He could although sense laser impacts and felt them 'tickling' him.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}

* '''Impaired Sense of Touch:''' As a side-effect of his invulnerability, his sense of touch is impaired.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}
* '''''Superhuman Stamina/Modified Metabolism/"Frozen" Body:''''' He's also "frozen" at the physical state he was in when his powers were activated, making his body incapable of losing or gaining weight or muscle mass.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}} It was speculated that a near-starvation regime could made him lose weight after a couple of years,{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}} but [[James Marks (Earth-616)|Hybrid]] stated while controlling him that he could feed off him forever,{{r|Avengers Academy #24}} hinting that Emery is immortal and would seemingly never lose weight.
* '''Extreme Clumsiness'''{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}
