| History                 = Trevor Hawkins was one of the new mutants to manifest their powers after [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|the war between Avengers and X-Men]].<ref>See in the [[#Notes|notes]] of the page, compared to his [[Trevor Hawkins (Earth-13729)|future counterpart]]</ref> He quickly enrolled in the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 19}} due to teasing in his public school.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 22}}

He was among the students to go to [[Frankenstein's Monster (Earth-616)|Frankenstein's Monster]]'s [[Murder Circus (Earth-616)|Murder Circus]]. He was beaten up by a mind-controlled [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] and zombie clowns, and prompted [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] to break free of the spell making him believe that he was a clown.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 21|#23}}

Later, he was among the group sent on a field trip to the [[Savage Land]] with Wolverine.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 25|28}}

When [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] and [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]] opposed each other with humiliating bets and dared each other to break into [[Doctor Strange (Stephen Strange)|Doctor Strange]]'s [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], Trevor was assigned as the observer, his mutant ability permitting him to see if Pixie would cheat using magic. This power proved to be useful, as he detected [[D'Spayre (Earth-616)|D'Spayre]]'s attack on Strange, and directed his teammates to attack him enough to allow the Sorcerer Supreme to defeat the demon. Contrary to Pixie and Quire, he was rewarded by Strange, who gave him a magical lens enhancing his powers.{{r|A + X #9}}

During his time with the [[Special Class (Earth-616)|Special Class]], he was imprisoned by [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]] in the [[Mojoverse]] and gained new abilities for his eyes as a result of experiments conducted by Mojo.{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men #3}}

===Generation X===
When Kitty Pryde relocated the X-Men to New York and the school was renamed to Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach, Trevor decided to join. He became part of [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]]'s team, consisting of [[Nathaniel Carver (Earth-616)|Nathaniel Carver]], [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]], [[Benjamin Deeds (Earth-616)|Benjamin Deeds]], [[Roxanne Washington (Earth-616)|Bling!]], and [[Lin Li (Earth-616)|Nature Girl]].{{r|Generation X Vol 2 2}} When a mysterious shadow in Central Park started stealing mutants during the night, Quentin convinced his classmates to investigate. They found themselves face-to-face with [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]], who was possessing his sister [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]]'s body at the time.{{r|Generation X Vol 2 3|4}}

Lin and Trevor were tasked with babysitting [[Shogo Lee (Earth-616)|Shogo]], so in order to do it, Nature Girl brought the two to the Central Park Zoo, inside the Bears' Den. Eye-Boy expressed to her his concern about Nature Girl's idea, babysitting Shogo surrounded by bears. Shogo is seen having fun playing with the bears, when the bears sensed danger and roared viciously. Eye-boy picked up Shogo immediately and carried him away. Eye-boy asked Nature Girl what was that all about as they watched the bears go back inside their cave. Lin warned him that something was coming and that they needed to get back to the school fast. Indeed, somewhere underground, Emplate was currently hiding and feeding off one of the captured Morlocks. Being carried by vultures, Eye-boy, Shogo, and Nature Girl arrived at the school; they tried to warn the other students about what was coming to them. Nature Girl also informed Quentin Quire that whatever it was, was coming towards him.{{r|Generation X Vol 2 8}}

[[File:Trevor Hawkins (Earth-616) and Lin Li (Earth-616) Generation X Vol 1 87.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]
Monet, merged with her brother Emplate, arrived at the institute in order to try to kill the students and drain their life forces. While Jubilee, Husk, and Chamber battled the threat, inside the classroom, Trevor, Roxy, Benjamin, Nathaniel, and Quentin came up with a plan on how to defeat him. A few days later, the team was preparing a surprise party for Roxy, who was going home to visit her family for a while. At the party, Trevor approached Lin, concerned about the bargain she made with the rats. Lin responded not to worry about it and added that if ever that time came, she promised that she would keep him safe. Kitty Pryde arrived to congratulate Jubilee on keeping her class alive.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 87}}

===Death===
When [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)|the Hive]] invaded [[Earth]], they began forcing [[Symbiotes (Race)|Symbiotes]] to bond with various superhumans, so in turn a [[Poisons|Poison]] could assimilate both the symbiote and its host. When [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)/Members#Poison X-Force|a Poison version of X-Force]] invaded the X-Mansion, Trevor was their first target.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 1}} He was consumed by a Poison not long afterwards, when the X-Men helped fend off an assault on [[Oscorp Tower|Alchemax Tower]].{{r|Venomized Vol 1 4}}

===Return===
Despite his apparent death, Trevor has since been seen alive, living and training at the Xavier's School.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 40}}{{r|Iceman Vol 4 1}} Trevor also attended the first meeting of the [[Mindfulness of Mutant Appearances (Earth-616)|Mindfulness of Mutant Appearances]], a support group set up by [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] for mutants who can't pass as normal humans.{{r|Domino Annual Vol 1 1}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Trevor was one of many mutants to oppose [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]] as he attempted to impose his vision of the world upon it. When Nate Grey realized that his vision for the world would never come to pass as long as the X-Men were around, he wiped them out in an instant, including Trevor.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9|10}}

===Age of X-Man===
Trevor and the others were transported to a [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|reality]] create by Nate Grey and a [[Life Seed]] where he attempted to create a utopia for mutants to live in. Those Nate brought there had their memories of their previous lives erased so there was no resistance.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}

Trevor became a member of [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Murshid En Sabah Nur]]'s revolutionary group known as the [[X-Tracts (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|X-Tracts]]. He helped keep [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]] safe from [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Clerk Iceman]] as he looked for the two individuals. Trevor used a vial of what he called "flashkick" derived from [[Unveil (Sharesse) (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Unveil]]'s powers to keep him and Kitty safe while she was phased through a statue. The two briefly kissed after Trevor explained about the object that they took. Suddenly, Eye-Boy was summoned by Nur along with Kitty to come back to their hideout, [[Gilded Tomb|The Gilded Tomb]].<!-- {{r|Age of X-Man: Apocalypse & the X-Tracts Vol 1 1}} -->

Trevor showed up with the others in order for them to combine their minds together and to share their thoughts and feelings in a what Murshid called the Perfect X. They all placed their hands on Unveil for this to work. Apocalypse then announced that he would hold a rally in [[Central Park]] as a ruse so Eye-Boy and the other Light Riders could travel to [[Kazakhstan]] to free the Russian [[Homo superior|mutant]] [[Arkady Rossovich (Earth-616)|Omega Red]].{{r|Age of X-Man: Apocalypse & the X-Tracts Vol 1 1}}

Trevor was eventually allowed to return to the real world when Nate Grey decided to free the mutants he trapped in his reality after he realized the flaws in his approach to the reality.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

===Krakoa===
[[File:Trevor Hawkins (Earth-616) from X-Factor Vol 4 1 001.jpg|thumb|right|On Krakoa]]
Trevor later became a citizen of the mutant-only nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 7}} There he joins the mutant investigative team X-Factor.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 1}} It was on this team that [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]] discovered that Trevor had many powers that had been undocumented and he decided to keep them from the council.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 9}}

He attended the [[Hellfire Gala]], but had to leave early to help [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|David Alleyne]] apprehend Buck Thatcher. It was in doing this that he first revealed his ability to blast beams of light from his hands. He also used this ability against [[Thomas Shepherd (Earth-616)|Tommy Shepherd]] in an attempt to prevent him from discovering [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|his mother]]'s corpse.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 10}}

Along with the rest of X-Factor, Trevor helped investigate the murder of the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlett Witch]].{{r|X-Men: The Trial of Magneto Vol 1 1}}
