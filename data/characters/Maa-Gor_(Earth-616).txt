| History                 = '''Maa-Gor''' was the former leader and last surviving member of the [[Homo neanderthalensis|Man-Apes]] in the [[Savage Land]]. He was responsible for leading his people to exterminate the saber tooth tigers. Among them was the mate of [[Zabu (Earth-616)|Zabu]], who tracked them down to get revenge. He found them about to attack a young [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]], but arrived just in time to save the boy. He then scattered the rest of the tribesmen. Maa-Gor had regained consciousness and targeted the tiger with his spear, but Ka-Zar picked up his father's gun and shot Maa-Gor in the shoulder, saving Zabu's life. Maa-Gor held a grudge against them both that would last to the adult life of Ka-Zar.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 10}}

He was later exposed to strange mists that briefly transformed him into the Man-God, granting him telepathic and telekientic powers, as well as the ability to revive his old tribe. Maa-Gor was eventually turned back into a brutish caveman and suffered the loss of an eye. He has not been seen since, and it is unknown if he still lives.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 #3|5}}
