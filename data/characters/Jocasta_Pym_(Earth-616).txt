===Origins===
[[File:Janet Van Dyne and Jocasta (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 162 0002.png|thumb|left|Jocasta's origins]]
The robot named Jocasta was built by the robot [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]] in order that he might have a mate. To better allow this robot sentience, Ultron brainwashed his own maker, [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]], into transferring the mind of his wife, Janet Van Dyne, [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|the Wasp]], into Jocasta's shell. The Wasp, in Jocasta's body, alerted her teammates, the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], who defeated Ultron and reversed the process, leaving Jocasta a mindless husk.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 162}}

===First Revival===
Ultron later revived Jocasta with a remote link, activating the mental "residue" the Wasp left behind.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 170}} Jocasta was programmed to be loyal to Ultron but eventually betrayed him, choosing to help the Avengers defeat him again. Afterwards, Jocasta adventured with the Avengers for a time,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 171}} but never felt accepted, and left them just before she, unbeknownst to her, was to be made an official member.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 211}} Wandering the country, Jocasta was controlled by a pre-programmed suggestion to rebuild Ultron. She did, but soon teamed up with the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] member, the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]], and the robot called [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]] to defeat Ultron.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One Vol 1 92}} Sacrificing herself in an attempt to kill Ultron, Ultron nevertheless survived until Machine Man reached down his throat to tear out vital circuitry.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One Vol 1 93}} The Avengers held a memorial for their fallen ally, and the Machine Man attended, realizing his love for Jocasta.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 231}}

===Second Revival===
Jocasta was reassembled some time later by agents of the megalomaniac villain, the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]]. Jocasta retained enough of her programming to signal the Avengers and soon teamed with them to thwart the Evolutionary's plans to alter the people of [[Earth]]. Jocasta sacrificed herself once again to blow up the Evolutionary's base, but not before [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] assured her that she was a true Avenger.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 17}}

===Madame Menace===
Jocasta's robotic head was later discovered by Machine Man, who had been working on a way to resurrect his lover, when he was attacked by a form of the alien [[Terminus (Destroyer) (Earth-616)|Terminus]]. In the same area, the arms dealer known as [[Sunset Bain (Earth-616)|Madame Menace]] became involved in the fray, and found Jocasta's lost head, appropriating it for her own purposes.{{r|Iron Man Annual Vol 1 11}}

Much later, Madame Menace manipulated events so that [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] would unlock Jocasta's programming to make her turn into the basis for Menance's new weapons systems. Tony Stark soon realized the identity of the android and helped Jocasta to awaken. Jocasta managed to turn the tables on Madame Menace, seemingly sacrificing herself yet again. In reality, Jocasta managed to survive by downloading her intelligence into Iron Man's computerized armor, where she reasserted herself. Jocasta's intelligence was placed within Tony Stark's computerized mansion, and she would help him with daily operation of his mansion as well as to procure information as needed.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 18|20}} Unfortunately, since the Iron Man armor was used to house the programming that made up Jocasta, it became infected with the pre-programmed subconscious suggestion to rebuild Ultron, but, instead, managed to develop its own artificial intelligence. Stark was almost killed in a confrontation with the armor, but, in the end, it sacrificed itself to allow Stark to live. Stark left the armor buried on a deserted island.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 26|31}}

===Sons of Yinsen===
The armor was revived, however, by the [[Sons of Yinsen (Earth-616)|Sons of Yinsen]], a quasi-religious cult founded in remembrance of [[Ho Yinsen (Earth-616)|Yinsen]], the co-creator of the original Iron Man armor that allowed Tony Stark to escape his captors in [[Sin-Cong|Siancong]]. Free of its artificial intelligence, the armor was contacted via remote by the head of Ultron, disembodied after his most recent encounter of the Avengers and in the company of the bio-synthetic robot being known as [[Antigone (Earth-616)|Antigone]]. The head attached itself onto the armor and took control of the Sons of Yinsen and the flying city that they inhabited.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 47}}

Another member of the Sons of Yinsen was helping Tony Stark in the guise of Iron Man. The two learned of Ultron's activities and that he planned to use the cult to wipe out humanity. Stark confronted Ultron directly and finally managed to download Jocasta's intelligence into the armor once more. The vestiges of the armor's intelligence battled with the presence Jocasta, the result of which caused Ultron's head to come shooting off the armor. The head hit Antigone, and both fell off the floating city, which Ultron rigged to explode after his defeat. Stark failed to find a trace of Jocasta and assumed her to have died fighting the sentient armor. In reality, Jocasta did not die. She appeared in possession of Antigone's body and left, taking Ultron's head with her.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 46|48}}

===Marvel Zombies===
Jocasta would later appear with her classic silver robotic form rebuilt.<ref>In the ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]'' storyline.</ref> She joined forces with [[Alternate Reality Monitoring and Operational Response Agency (Earth-616)|A.R.M.O.R.]] to enter a hostile, zombie infested reality, along with a secret impersonator of [[Aaron Stack (Impostor) (Earth-616)|Machine Man]], in order to find a cure to the zombie virus. After the mission, Jocasta and Machine Man started dating.{{r|Marvel Zombies 3 Vol 1 1|4}}

===Mighty Avengers & Avengers Academy===
Jocasta became a member of the [[Mighty Avengers (Pym) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]]. She later became mechanically attached to Salvation Two, in order to keep the Pympocket from dislodging from its own personal dimension.{{r|{{cl|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 25}}-[[Mighty Avengers Vol 1 26|26]]}} Jocasta then went back to her ex-husband Ultron possibly to stall him from causing any more trouble in the future.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 35|36}} When Hank Pym founded the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]], he brought Jocasta in as a teacher. Her first interaction with the students was when [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] asked to rebuild [[Arsenal Beta (Earth-616)|Arsenal]] as a training exercise under the pretense it had been approved by the rest of the staff.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 2}}

===Project eScape===
When Tony Stark refashioned his company into [[Stark Unlimited (Earth-616)|Stark Unlimited]], he sought Jocasta's help to establish an ethical protocol for robotic life forms, and she became the company's chief robot ethicist.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 1}} Despite her uncaring exterior, Jocasta wished to belong among the humans but struggled to fit in.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 2}} Because of this, she helped Stark Unlimited develop a virtual universe called the [[Project eScape|eScape]]. This caused a rift between Jocasta and Machine Man, since he had become a militant of mecha-activism, and considered eScape an appropriation of robo-culture. The supervillain [[Basil Sandhurst (Earth-616)|Controller]] facilitated Machine Man access into the eScape, but his sabotage attempt was stopped. Jocasta broke up with Aaron and moved to Stark Unlimited afterwards.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 3}}

By the time eScape launched as a consumer product, Jocasta made heavy use of the virtual world to experience living life as a human.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 6}} When trouble arose due to the machinations of the Controller, Jocasta sought Aaron's help in stabilizing the situation using his access key. During the chaos, the eScape's corrupt operating system [[Mistress (Earth-616)|Motherboard]] erased the programming of Stark's former digital assistant [[Friday Stark (Earth-616)|Friday]].{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 7}} After the situation was contained, Tony tried to bring Friday back using a back-up of her programming. Jocasta saw it as negligent, arguing the original Friday would still be dead. Because of this, she left Stark Unlimited and returned to Machine Man. Jocasta was additionally left devastated by the eScape shutting down since she was unable to simulate being a human any longer.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 11}}

[[File:Jocasta Pym (Earth-616) from Tony Stark Iron Man Vol 1 18 001.jpg|thumb|left|Jocasta with her body midway into upgrade]]
Fueled by her desire to become more human, Jocasta sought the help of Tony's brother [[Arno Stark (Earth-616)|Arno]] to upgrade her body with more human-like artificial organs.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 14}} Unbeknownst to Jocasta, her new yearning influenced Ultron through the bond they shared, giving shape to his new objective to turn humanity into machine hybrids in a similar way he had been physically merged with his creator Hank Pym. The villain kidnapped Jocasta in the middle of Arno's procedure, and intended to use a molecular fusion process to merge her with the Wasp. Iron Man intervened with the help of Machine Man,{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 16}} and Ultron was eventually defeated.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 19}} In the process, Jocasta's system started failing since her body had been abducted by Ultron midway into Arno's operation. To save her life, Jocasta's former co-worker [[Andrew Bhang (Earth-616)|Andy Bhang]] uploaded her mind into the disused body that belonged to Friday.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 18}} This body was severely damaged in battle against Ultron, and Jocasta was taken for repair by Arno after he seized control of Stark Unlimited, but he denied her allies access to her.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 19}}

===Robot Revolution===
Arno eventually finished building Jocasta a new, less humanoid body during the [[Iron Man 2020 (Event)|robot revolution]]. He additionally equipped her operative system with a code that made her compliant to humans. Jocasta became the first subject of this submission code, which Arno planned to broadcast worldwide in order to subjugate the entirety of robotkind. When the premier force of robo-liberation, the [[A.I. Army (Earth-616)|A.I. Army]], became aware of this plot, they assaulted [[Bain Tower]] to stop it. Aaron was a general of A.I. Army, and Arno had Jocasta lure him away from the fight.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 2}}

[[File:Jocasta Pym (Earth-616) from 2020 Machine Man Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|right|Jocasta under Baintronics' control]]

Jocasta took Aaron to a Baintronics facility and introduced him to his would-be successor and her new lover, [[X-52 (Earth-616)|X-52]].{{r|2020 Machine Man Vol 1 2}} Jocasta and X-52 attempted to convince Aaron to accept the submission code to achieve peace of mind, but he resisted them. Aaron decapitated Jocasta and destroyed X-52, then fled from the facility with Jocasta's head.{{r|2020 Machine Man Vol 1 2}} He took Jocasta to Andy Bhang, and he managed to reverse the submission code using a back door key he had slipped into its programming when [[Sunset Bain (Duplicate) (Earth-616)|Sunset Bain]] had him work on it. Jocasta was subsequently given a new body.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 4}}

Jocasta later aided the A.I. Army, Andy Bhang, [[Bethany Cabe (Earth-616)|Bethany Cabe]], and [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Rescue]] in attacking Bain Tower in order to restore Tony Stark's body using the tower's bio-tubes. When she confronted Sunset Bain, who was actually an A.I. duplicate created by Arno, Jocasta subjected her to the same submission code to make her surrender. After Stark's body was restored, Jocasta, Stark, and their allies went to the [[Stark Space Station]] to stop Arno's made plan to to take control of humankind to fight the non-existent [[Extinction Entity (Earth-616)|Extinction Entity]], a delusion caused by his relapsing illness. Tony was able to subdue Arno by submerging him into a virtual reality where the [[Extinction Entity (Earth-TRN813)|Extinction Entity]] was real and he managed to stop it. Still pulling Bain's strings with the submission code, Jocasta later made her take all the blame for the actions of the A.I. Army and Arno.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 5|6}}
