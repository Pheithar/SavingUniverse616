===Early Life===
Delroy Garrett, Jr. grew up to become a track star and competed in the [[Olympic Games]]. After he tested positive for steroids, he lost his three gold medals. In despair, he turned to religion, specifically the [[Triune Understanding]]. This group's founder, [[Jonathan Tremont (Earth-616)|Jonathan Tremont]], had found one of three fragments of a mysterious object and used it to give Garrett the powers of [[3-D Man]]. Garrett assumed that his powers were because of his newfound spiritual enlightenment, and Tremont never disabused him of the notion.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 50}}

[[File:Delroy Garrett Jr. (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 3 8 0001.jpg|thumb|left|as Triathlon]]
Triathlon served as the Triune Understanding's spokesperson for a while. While at JFK Airport, he witnessed the capture of the Avengers by [[Moses Magnum]] and freed them.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 #8|9}} He crossed paths with the Avengers again when [[Lord Templar]] and [[Pagan]] disrupted the dedication of a Triune Understanding facility, during which the facility sustained heavy damage.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 15}} Tremont launched a public relations campaign that painted the team as biased and irresponsible, which was only a ploy to force them to recruit Triathlon. It worked.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 27}} Either because he believed Tremont's public statements about the Avengers or because he felt sensitive about his standing, Triathlon had difficulty fitting in at Avenger's Mansion. With time, though, he developed friendships with [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Pulsar]] and [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Warbird]] and got past his initial hostility.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 2 2001}}

While [[Kang the Conqueror]] was conquering Earth, a giant pyramid arrived from space. Triathlon learned that the universe had somehow created three artifacts as a response to this Triple-Evil; that Tremont had set up the Triune Understanding as a means to locate the three artifacts; and, most important, that he and Tremont both possessed a fragment. The Avengers (including Triathlon) and Tremont boarded the pyramid. Only then did they learn that Tremont, instead of hoping to destroy the Triple-Evil, wanted its immense power for himself. Triathlon refused to give up his fragment, and when he found the third fragment in the pyramid, he took Tremont's fragment. Uniting all three fragments gave him the power to seize control of the pyramid and defeat Kang (with a little help from the Avengers). Soon afterward, Triathlon (as well as others) left the team when it restructured. He also left the Triune Understanding.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 #47|55}}

===[[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]] and Post Civil War===
[[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] recruited Triathlon for the [[Secret Avengers (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]], a team that worked against the [[Superhuman Registration Act]].{{r|Civil War #5}} Following the defeat of Captain America's Anti-Registration Forces, Triathlon became a member of the [[Initiative]]. After graduating from [[Camp Hammond]]'s Initiative trainee program, Triathlon was given the new identity of 3-D Man and assigned to [[Point Men (Earth-616)|Hawaii' team]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #1|12}}

===[[Secret Invasion]]===
Delroy arrived in [[Hawaii (State)|Hawaii]] and was greeted by Point Men team members [[Star Sign (Earth-616)|Star Sign]] and [[Paydirt (Earth-616)|Paydirt]]. He encountered [[Eric Payne (Earth-616)|Devil-Slayer]] on the way to the base, who stated that he has sensed portents of doom all day. When he met the final team member [[Magnitude (Earth-616)|Magnitude]], the goggles Delroy obtained from the original 3-D Man allowed him to identify Magnitude as a Skrull impostor. The Skrull Magnitude (who had the powers of [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], and [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]]) attacked and severely wounded Star Sign and Paydirt, but Delroy killed the Skrull with a sword magically summoned by Devil-Slayer.

Devil Slayer then used his Shadow Cloak to teleport Delroy to Camp Hammond, where he announced to everyone assembled that the Initiative had been infiltrated by Skrulls. The [[Z'Reg (Earth-616)|Crusader (Z'Reg)]], fearing that he would be exposed as a Skrull, used the Freedom Ring, and suddenly 3-D Man saw every non-Skrull surrounding him as a Skrull. Crusader persuaded 3-D Man to take a [[Quinjet]] and get help, but only because it would take him out of range of his ring's influence. Mid-flight, the Quinjet was affected by the virus the Skrulls used to infect all Starktech systems, and 3-D Man crashed somewhere in [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]].

There, he met and joined the [[Skrull Kill Krew (Earth-616)|Skrull Kill Krew]] after they vanquished the Skrull posing as [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|She-Thing]]. He assisted them when his goggles identified [[Blacksmith (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Blacksmith]] of the [[Desert Stars (Earth-616)|Desert Stars]] as a Skrull and immediately killed him. Delroy Garret's goggles also identified [[Terrance Sorenson (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Equinox]] as a Skrull who was then killed by [[Abigail Boylen (Earth-616)|Cloud 9]]. While in [[Philadelphia (Pennsylvania)|Philadelphia]], the [[Revolutionary (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Revolutionary]] was revealed as a Skrull and defeated by [[Greg Willis (Earth-616)|Gravity]] and [[Ariana Diamante (Earth-616)|Hope]].

When they came across a fight between [[Tarene (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Thor Girl]] and [[Tsu-Zana (Earth-616)|Ultragirl]], Delroy's goggles identified Thor Girl as a Skrull. With help from Gravity, Delroy used Thor Girl's own hammer to kill the Skrull impostor. When it came to a crowd uprising dealing with Skrulls in the form of civilians, Delroy's goggles were broken giving his allies a hard time finding out which civilians were Skrulls. During the struggle, Delroy discovered that he could see who was a Skrull without his goggles. This turned the tide against those Skrulls disguised as crowd members. When it came to the fight at Camp Hammond, Delroy's Skrull-detecting abilities detected Crusader as a Skrull after he killed [[Criti Noll (Clone) (Earth-616)|Criti Noll]] and Delroy shot Crusader, unaware that Crusader was not part of the invasion forces.

Delroy left the Initiative, noting the hostility of [[Wallace Jackson (Earth-616)|Red Nine]], [[Alex Ellis (Earth-616)|Annex]], [[Delilah Deerborn (Earth-616)|Geiger]], [[James Santini (Earth-616)|Batwing]], and [[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Prodigy]] over the shooting of Crusader, and joined [[Ryder (Earth-616)|Ryder]] to hunt for any Skrulls still hiding out on Earth.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #14|20}}

===Agent of Atlas===
Delroy approached the [[Agents of Atlas (Earth-616)|Agents of Atlas]] in helping investigate strange questions regarding his history and powers. He was later asked to join the team, an offer he accepted.{{r|Atlas #1|5}}

===AXIS===
In the wake of the [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]], [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]'s personality was inverted, along with that of numerous heroes and villains. After having seen the errors of his ways, Doom planned to redeem himself. After the Avengers disappeared, having being captured by the inverted and evil [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]], Doom tasked [[Valeria Richards]] with the mission to assemble a group of certain available heroes, including 3-D Man, each having specific skills which could be utilized. The new [[Avengers (Doctor Doom's) (Earth-616)|Avengers]] assembled in Doctor Doom's Castle, and jumped into action when the evil [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] arrived to [[Latveria]] to have revenge on Doom.{{r|Avengers World #15}}

The Avengers fought the Scarlet Witch and saved villagers trapped in the crossfire. 3-D Man managed to get hold of the Witch and take her to a machine Doctor Doom had created to specifically canalize her abilities. Soon after being put into the machine, the Scarlet Witch escaped and set out to find Doom, leaving the Avengers behind. After condensing a portion of Scarlet Witch's powers into the device, Valeria informed the heroes their job was done.{{r|Avengers World #16}}

===[[Secret Empire (Event)|Secret Empire]]===
After [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]] revealed himself to be a [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] sleeper agent and established a Hydra Empire,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} Delroy, like many heroes, was on the run. At some point, he got turned in by Deadpool, who found him "pumped up" with "muscle relaxers" & "Goofy Pills".{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 33}}
