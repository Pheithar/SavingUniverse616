===Origins===
According to legend, Agamotto emerged from the tear of [[Oshtur (Earth-616)|Oshtur]], benevolent [[Elder Gods of Earth|Elder Goddess]] of Earth, as she was moved by the unyielding joy of a blind boy, circa 25,000 BC,{{r|Avengers: Roll Call #1|; Agamotto's profile}} though it is now known that Agamotto was already an adult and the [[Sorcerer Supreme]] during the [[Stone Age]], in 1,000,000 BC.{{r|Marvel Legacy #1}} He was born a mortal{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 7|; Magic - Index: A: Commonly Invoked Mystic Principalities: [[Watoomb (Earth-616)|Watoomb]]'s profile}} (but not a [[Homo sapiens|human]]).{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 7|; Magic - History of the [[Sorcerer Supreme]]: [[Hermes Trismegistrus (Earth-616)|Hermes Trismegistrus]] was "the first human male to bear the title" of Sorcerer Supreme}}

[[File:Agamotto (Earth-616) from Marvel Legacy Vol 1 1 Deodato Wraparound Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Agamotto's human form (1,000,000 BC)]]
===Early years===
He was initially tutored by Oshtur, and his subsequent journey to discover the secrets of magic and find Oshtur led to the formation of the paths of magic power. Agamotto also served as Earth's first [[Sorcerer Supreme]], defending it and its reality against such threats as [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]]{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Mystic Arcana: The Book of Marvel Magic #1}} and the [[Zgreb (Earth-616)|Fallen]] alongside other powerful beings assembled as the [[Avengers (1,000,000 BC) (Earth-616)|Stone Age Avengers]].{{r|Marvel Legacy #1}}

Agamotto created a number of magical artifacts. The [[Eye of Agamotto]] and the [[Orb of Agamotto]] were used by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]].{{r|Marvel Premiere #5}} Agamotto is also credited<!-- ,{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 7|; Magic - History of Sorcerer Supreme}} at least partially,{{citation}} --> with the creation of the [[Book of the Vishanti]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 7|; Magic - History of Sorcerer Supreme}}

The fourth [[Rings of Raggador|Ring of Raggadorr]] was freed from the [[Dungeons of Dyzakk]] by Agamotto during his travels throughout the dimensions.{{r|[http://www.marvunapp.com/ohotmu/appendixes/mdapp.htm Mystic Dimensions - From the Journals of Ian McNee at the Appendix]: The [[Consecution of Colour|Outer Planes (The Consecution of Colours)]], [[Raggadorr (Dimension)|Raggadorr]]'s profile}}

At some point, he became one of the few mortals sorcerers, such as [[Watoomb (Earth-616)|Watoomb]], to become a [[Glossary:Principalities|principality]], a higher being invoked for power.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 7|; Magic - Index: A: Commonly Invoked Mystic Principalities: [[Watoomb (Earth-616)|Watoomb]]'s profile}}

===Modern days===
Agamotto and the Vishanti were worshiped at the [[Temple of the Three]].{{r|Doctor Strange and Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment Vol 1 1}} His avatar was [[Cody Fleischer (Earth-616)|Cadaver]], the Pale Horseman.{{r|Secret Defenders #15|17}} [[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Doctor Druid]] was forced to unmake Agamotto's [[Moebius Stone]], but not before it transformed Cody Fleisch into Cadaver, Agamotto's agent.{{r|Secret Defenders #16}}

During the [[War of the Seven Spheres]], the [[Vishanti (Earth-616)|Vishanti]] battled their rivals, the [[Trinity of Ashes (Earth-616)|Trinity of Ashes]]. Despite an initial refusal, Doctor Strange was enlisted to serve them in the war. After their victory, he was returned to Earth.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #48|49}}{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #80}}

Agamotto's appearance varied when he was encountered in his realm. He was known to appear to Doctor Strange as a caterpillar smoking a pipe in a realm that appeared to be out of ''Alice in Wonderland'', capable of human speech and was not intimidated by [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]]. He is actually the entire dimension itself, as was why Galactus was unable to destroy him permanently. During a quarrel with Galactus, he assumed a more menacing version of the same form.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #43}}

When [[Isaiah Curwen (Earth-616)|Silver Dagger]] was placed into the dimension, Agamotto tried to convince him to stay. Silver Dagger eventually escaped. This was later revealed to be a ploy by Agamotto to see if Silver could change when in possession of an old version of the Eye Of Agamotto.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 #1|5}}

====Heroic Age====
Agamotto was behind the demonic invasion of earth as he saw the previous Sorcerer Supreme, [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]], as a failure and the current one, [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Brother Vodoo]], as inexperienced. He first appeared to [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]] after possessing him and dragging him to the spirit realm.  Using the guise of the [[Yao (Earth-616)|Ancient One]], he convinces Rand that Dr. Strange stole the Eye of Agomotto and is unworthy of it. After a brief fight, Iron Fist realizes that he has been tricked. They soon realize that Iron Fist did not meet Ancient One, but rather someone else. Agamotto then appears in the figure of a tiger, but he shapeshifts into his true form, then possesses the New Avengers to attack Strange. Doctor Voodoo then arrives and frees the New Avengers. He then tells Agomotto that they challenge him to a fight, and empowers [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] with the powers of Iron Fist and [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]]. Wolverine is sent into Agamotto's plane and they fight, but Wolverine begins to lose. Meanwhile, the spirit of [[Daniel Drumm (Earth-616)|Daniel Drumm]], which has become trapped there attacks Agamotto. Seeing that Agamotto would call this as cheating and once again invade Earth, he steps into Agamotto's realm. Brother Voodoo then sacrifices his life to kill Agamotto by destroying the eye and orb of Agamotto.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 #1|6}}

Despite his death however, Agamotto still has a mystical connection to [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]] whom he previously trapped in his dimension when his power possessed Iron Fist in interfering with the Immortal Weapons mission in closing the gate to the Eighth City until [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] knocked Iron Fist out.{{r|Iron Man 2.0 #5|7}} [[Gwendolyn Poole (Earth-TRN565)|Gwenpool]] claimed Agamotto gave her her magic rocket launcher.{{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 25}}

| Powers                  = As the [[Sorcerer Supreme]] of the [[Marvel Universe]], and the spawn of an [[Elder Gods of Earth|Elder God]] of [[Earth]], a realm where magic appears especially attuned, Agamotto possesses extremely powerful magical abilities, which he can channel to certain mystics, mainly the [[Sorcerer Supreme]] of the mainstream Earth dimension, sufficient in strength for him to usually defend his reality. Agamotto has held his own against entities of such power as [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]] and [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] on several separate occasions when they clashed, making it apparent his full power can rival either's. It has been hinted that he is more powerful than both [[Oshtur (Earth-616)|Oshtur]] and [[Hoggoth (Earth-616)|Hoggoth]] combined, despite being the spawn of the former. As the Vishanti, their power and omniscience is even further magnified. Agamotto specializes in divination and truth, such as the [[Eye of Agamotto]]'s all-revealing light. Agamotto is described as "all-knowing," implying omniscience in dimensions even beyond his own, or at least potent mystic sensory abilities. So powerful are his abilities to gather knowledge, that he even has classified information concerning [[Abstract Entities|Cosmic entities]] in other universes, such as Galactus, since he was aware that he had been Galan and of his origins. Such is the magical potency of Agamotto that the [[Sorcerer Supreme]], Doctor Strange, was unable to banish him back to his own realm, even when invoking the united strength of Dormammu, Cytorrak, Watoomb, Raggadorr, Denak, the Seraphim, the Faltine, Ikonn and Valtorr to fuel the spell. Agamotto is even capable of resurrecting others, as he did to Cadaver, as well as opening time portals.

*'''Magical Manipulation:''' Agamotto is one of the three mystical entities known as the Vishanti. He created some of magical artifacts used by the Sorcerer Supreme such as [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]] and [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Doctor Voodoo]]. Agamotto can create and manipulate magical attacks.

*'''Shapeshifting:''' Agamotto can shapeshift to other creatures or entities.

| Equipment               = Agamotto's "pipe" is actually a powerful magical artifact that assists Agamotto with his magics. He is also in some way powerfully linked to the [[Orb of Agamotto]] and the [[Eye of Agamotto]], able to recall them across dimensions from even the grasp of a Sorcerer Supreme at whim.
