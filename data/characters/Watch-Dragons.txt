Two large red flying "dragons" created by [[Casiolena (Earth-616)|Casiolena]] to protect the mobile stronghold of [[Ollerus (Earth-616)|Ollerus]]. The creatures resembled pterodactyls but were sentient and could speak. The first was defeated by [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]], enabling the other to capture her, before its death at the hands of [[Harokin (Earth-616)|Harokin]].{{r|Defenders Vol 1 67}}
