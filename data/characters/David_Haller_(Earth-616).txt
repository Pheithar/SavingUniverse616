===Early life===
David Haller is the son of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]] and [[Gabrielle Haller (Earth-616)|Gabrielle Haller]], who later became the [[Israel]]i ambassador to the [[United Kingdom]]. Charles and [[Gabrielle Haller (Earth-616)|Gabrielle Haller]] had an affair in Israel nearly two decades ago, and Charles was unaware when he left Israel that Haller was pregnant with his son. Haller concealed the fact that Charles was the father of her son, David, and Charles himself only learned that he was David's father some time after founding the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]]. David was born a [[mutant]] with the potential for superhuman powers.{{r|New Mutants #1}}

It was later suggested by [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggert]]'s journals that David's birth had been engineered by Moira and Xavier. Xavier had identified the need for a mutant with the power to warp reality, and Moira had identified potential matches for herself and Xavier that might result in such a mutant.{{r|Powers of X #6}}

===Power Development===
When David was living in [[Paris (France)|Paris]] with his mother, who was a member of the Israel diplomatic service, her home was invaded by a terrorist assassination team out to kill every Israeli they could find there. They murdered David's stepfather, [[Daniel Shomron (Earth-616)|Daniel Shomron]], before his eyes. David's terror catalyzed his latent psionic powers, which he used to incinerate the brains of the assassins. However, as he did so, he found himself making telepathic contact with each of his victims, thus experiencing their thoughts and emotions as they died. The horror of all this deeply traumatized the gentle, loving David, forcing him into a catatonic state. The consciousness of the leader of the assassins, Jemail Karami, was absorbed into David's mind.{{r|New Mutants #28}}

Karami's consciousness merged with David's, and it took Karami years to separate his consciousness from his psychic captor's. Nevertheless, although Karami regained his sense of self, his consciousness remained trapped within David's mind. Karami discovered that he somehow gained control of David's mutant telepathic power and used it to read David's mind. Karami thus discovered that David was essentially a gentle, innocent person. Karami then read the minds of Gabrielle Haller and others, and with a better understanding of those around him, decided to restore David's mind to normalcy. The terrible trauma that David had suffered had splintered David's personality into multiple personalities. Each of these personalities controlled a different psionic power, many of which are as yet unknown. Karami began re-integrating these personalities into David's core personality, which was that of a little boy desperately needing parental help.{{r|New Mutants #28}}

However, some of these personalities resisted Karami's efforts, and two proved to be particularly formidable opponents: Jack Wayne, a swaggering adult roustabout adventurer who commanded David's telekinetic power, and Cyndi, a temperamental, rebellious girl who controlled David's pyrokinetic power. Wayne was especially hostile, and intended to destroy Karami's consciousness in order to preserve his own independent existence within David's mind. Karami found himself fighting a war against Wayne and the other resisting personalities in a dreamscape world within David's mind resembling a mad blend of Paris (from David's childhood memories) and Beirut (from Karami's memories).{{r|{{cl|New Mutants Vol 1 26}}-[[New Mutants Vol 1 28|28]]}}

===On Muir Island===
When David was in his late teens he had gone from being catatonic to being autistic and had been placed by his mother in the care of Dr. [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggart]], a renowned scientist engaged in the study of mutants, and a longtime colleague of Charles Xavier. David began to manifest his psionic abilities uncontrollably in the real world, and absorbed the psyches of two of MacTaggart's friends, Tom Corsi and Sharon Friedlander. MacTaggart summoned Xavier to her research center on Muir Island off the coast of Scotland, bringing with him several of the New Mutants, including [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]], [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Mirage]], and [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]]. David absorbed MacTaggart and Wolfsbane's consciousnesses, or their astral selves, into his mind. Xavier's attempted to probe David's mind, bringing Mirage's astral self with him for assistance. David's mind then absorbed the astral selves of Cypher and Gabrielle Haller, and those of Xavier and Mirage followed them. It was just before Xavier actually entered David's mind that he learned that David was his son and that the multiple personalities called themselves Legion (after the Biblical quotation Mark 5:9, "My name is Legion for we are many").{{r|New Mutants #26}}

All of the consciousnesses that Legion had just "captured" retained their independent existences within David's mind. The new arrivals found themselves teaming up with Wayne and Cyndi against Karami, having been deceived by Wayne as to Karami's true motives. However, Mirage prevented Wayne from destroying Karami, who told her and Gabrielle Haller how he had been trying to help David. Working with the reluctant Wayne, Mirage and Karami completed the task of restoring David's mind to near-normalcy, and Mirage and Karami returned the consciousnesses absorbed from outside (including Mirage's own) back to their own bodies. (Since Karami's body was long dead, his psyche remained within David's mind.){{r|New Mutants #28}}

However, Karami was unable to integrate the Wayne and Cyndi personalities into David's core persona, and so they remained separate personalities within David's mind. Wayne and Cyndi sometimes spoke to people in the real world through David, as could Karami, whose consciousness also remained an independent entity within David's mind. However, David himself was no longer autistic, and his normal, core personality was in control of his mind and body. David's dominant personality was still that of a ten-year-old boy, just as it was before he suffered the trauma. Apparently the conflict within David's mind among his splinter personalities affected his physiognomy, accounting for his unusual appearance. (Perhaps one of his personalities controlled shapeshifting powers.) It is not known whether or not David would have been more normal in appearance if his normal personality had retained control of his body.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 7}}
[[File:David Haller (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 40 (Cover).jpg|left|thumb]]
Some time later, an accident happened that would have killed Wolfsbane and Moira if David hadn't used his telekinetic power to save them. However, by doing this David allowed Jack to take control over his body and escape to Scotland to indulge himself. The New Mutants tracked him down and fought him. Jack forced Cyndi to help him. Cyndi didn't like being "anyone's puppet," but she didn't want to be locked up for only wanting to live. Sunspot had Magik take him and Legion into Limbo, warning Jack that unless he relinquished control, Magik would remove him from Legion's mind and obliterate him; in response, Jack retreated into David's subconscious, allowing David to resume control.{{r|New Mutants #44}}

Months later, Muir Island was attacked by Donald Pierce and his Reavers during their ongoing campaign against Wolverine and his friends. David was in the nursery playing with Sunder and the Warpies, who were taken in when the island became a safe haven for the lost souls. Again, David reached out with his telekinetic powers, hoping to defend his friends from harm, but once more allowed Jack Wayne to reach the surface of his mind. Now in control, Wayne thought it would be cute to reshape the telekinetic shield to protect only him, leaving Sunder vulnerable to the gunfire.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #254}}

Jack and Cyndi ran wild during the attack, doing as they pleased without any thought of the consequences, even after Freedom Force arrived to help fend off the Reavers. By snuffing out Pyro’s flame at a key moment, Cyndi accidentally ensured the death of Stonewall. Legion, while under the control of the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]], also assaulted the elderly precog, Destiny, who had sensed him in advance and sent her protector Forge away so that he would not suffer the same fate. Legion probed Destiny’s mind, only to see visions of his own uncertain future reflected in her precognitive sight. Panicking, Legion struck out with a telepathic blast and killed Destiny before she could show him anymore.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #255}}{{r|X-Men Forever #2}}

Legion's part in the day's tragedies remained unknown; due to the fortifying of the island's defenses and the overall negative emotional influence of Lorna Dane’s new powers no one noticed his changes. Jack Wayne assumed control over David’s body and all of his powers and decided to have some fun with the island’s inhabitants. He began by imprisoning Polaris in the Mutant X detention cell, since she was the only one unaffected by her own “negativity” force and therefore could discover the truth about him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #257}}

Jack acted like David Haller in the presence of others, and so he allowed himself to be used by Forge in an experiment to locate the missing X-Men with a Cerebro unit. Unfortunately, they made telepathic contact with something else, the Shadow King.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #259}} For unknown reason the Shadow King let go of his hold of the island when the New Warriors and New Mutants descended on Muir Island. Legion tried to use his power to reabsorb [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]]'s energy from [[Gilbert Benson (Earth-616)|Piecemeal]]. Unfortunately, the depth of Piecemeal's pain telepathically bled through Legion's mind, causing him to drop his telekinetic fields. The plan fell apart when Proteus’s energy burned out Piecemeal and re-birthed MacTaggart himself, who banished the heroes to a dimension of nothingness.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 15}}

X-Factor, who had made a failed attempt to stop Proteus and reclaim Edinburgh, were also banished. Jean Grey had been exposed to Proteus’s thoughts during the fight. She used Legion and Jemail’s telepathy to share the experience with everyone, showing them the peace Proteus had achieved in his incorporeal state and that his efforts to restructure Edinburgh were an attempt to recreate the same peace in the real world. Tragically, the gathering of heroes were forced to convince Proteus he could never find the same happiness in life that he found in death so Proteus chose to die again.{{r|X-Factor Annual #6}}

After returning to the Muir Island, the Shadow King, using Jack Wayne’s captive, Polaris, as a nexus for negative energy, expanded his influence over the globe, pushing the darkness within humanity to the surface. The X-Men, who had just returned from space with Professor X, attempted to infiltrate the island but were quickly discovered. Legion personally confronted Storm. David Haller resisted the Shadow King’s demands, but Jack Wayne was more than willing to carry out Farouk’s commands. The negative influence made Wayne strong enough to access all of Legion’s powers and he shot down Storm with a combination of telepathic, telekinetic and pyrokinetic power.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #278}} After the death of his primary host, the Shadow King took a new host, Legion himself and used his immense power to unleash a devastating blast that destroyed more than two-thirds of Muir Island.{{r|X-Factor #69}}

The Shadow King used David's body to torment Prof. X, mocking him while he thought that he was corrupting David. The Shadow King revealed that he'd merely given David self-control by healing his fractured mind, and that David enjoyed it. David's physical body was hurt by Storm and needed time to heal so the Shadow King retreated. When the Shadow King was finally defeated and pushed from David's mind, David was left in a vegetative state.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #280}} Prof. X didn't want to lose his son so he desperately searched for any trace of consciousness inside David's mind. Unable to locate any signs of activity, he reluctantly accepted that David was gone.{{r|X-Factor #70}}

===Legion Quest===
[[File:David Haller (Earth-616), X-Men (Earth-616), Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616), and Irene Adler (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 38.jpg|thumb|David's vision and awakening from his coma]]
David was consigned to an intensive care ward at a hospital in Tel Aviv, his body receiving the best of care in the hopes that his mind might someday return. Many months later, David awakened with his mind completely healed after visions of Destiny urged him on towards his true destiny.{{r|X-Men #38}} For a time David faked being in a coma while using his telepathic power to link his mind to his father's dreams. In them, he appeared as Magneto to try to convince his father that if Magneto was out of the way his dream of human/mutant unity would come true. However, David's attempts failed when Xavier refused to accept that Magneto's death would help realize his dream. Hearing this, David revealed himself and told his father he disagreed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #319}} When Mystique came to murder David for killing Destiny, he stopped pretending to be in a coma, telekinetically blasted her away, and claimed he was expecting her.{{r|X-Factor #108}}

Mystique fled, promising to return, and was pursued by X-Factor. Shortly afterwards, Gabrielle Haller was shocked and overjoyed when David called her mother, thinking that her son was finally whole again. David fainted again and in his mind made a tombstone for his splinter personality while having another vision of Destiny. When he awakened he seemed incoherent, and when his mother brought Forge to help him, he was gone. When David found Mystique battling Forge and Wolfsbane he stopped them so he could deliver Destiny's message to Mystique. He then teleported X-Factor away, saying they needed to be somewhere else. When Mystique questioned David, he said he would fix everything and "make it all better" before flying away.{{r|X-Factor #109}}

David flew to Negev Desert where he had another vision of Destiny. In it she claimed it was his destiny to heal the rift between humans and mutants thus making the world as his father had always wanted. Believing the visions, he started to construct a "psychic bunker".{{r|X-Men Vol 2 39}} In an effort to learn his goals, the military sent vehicles into the dome David constructed only to have them destroyed. Gabrielle Haller contacted the X-Men for help. Failing to enter David's "bunker," the X-Men's Blackbird was caught in a telekinetic field. David claimed to be happy to see his "step-siblings," thinking they were there to support him. Legion told the heroes to say what they wanted, but to watch their tone as he was no longer insane. Jean Grey tried to convince him that he was still not fully healed, but David disagreed. The young mutant insisted that he was whole at last and that he would complete his father's work. When Storm questioned him again, David pulled her through a time portal, arriving at the moment her parents perished. David told her she could save them which she tried to do, only to be wrenched back to the future. Storm claimed that what she saw was an illusion, but David insisted it was real time travel and that she simply was not fast enough to save her family. Realizing what Legion was trying to do, Storm asked Psylocke to link her mind with Bishop (who had just tried to absorb Legion's energy) and a moment later the mutants were dragged to the past with David.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #320}}

An alternate future dubbed the "[[Earth-295|Age of Apocalypse]]" was created when Legion went back in time to kill [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] before he could oppose Xavier's dream, but instead inadvertently killed Xavier himself.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 41}} Only [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] remembered the proper timeline, so he traveled to the moment of Xavier's murder and used Legion's own power to create a psionic loop, forcing the young mutant to see the damage he had caused. The energy released by this event was so intense that David apparently died. Since Bishop had prevented Legion from killing Xavier, the normal timeline was restored.{{r|X-Men Omega #1}}

===Return of Legion===
After [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]]'s attack, Legion disappeared into somewhere called the "no-time." Here David encountered and absorbed the psyches of many others, splintering many more times to create hundreds of new personas. He was found here by [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]]. She made contact with his Legion-personality and brought him back to [[Earth-616|Earth]] in exchange for his promise to help her destroy the [[Elder Gods]] and reclaim her soul.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 1|21}} David emerged near Westcliffe, [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]] where he met [[Marci Sabol (Earth-616)|Marci Sabol]]. She helped David, gave him water and played games with him. Unfortunately, one of Legion's murderous personalities emerged, killed the girl and absorbed her psyche into Legion's mind.{{r|{{cl|New Mutants Vol 3 1}}-[[New Mutants Vol 3 5|5]]}}

After embarking on a mission to investigate a report of mutant activity in Colorado, Danielle Moonstar and [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]] went missing. Karma attempted to reach out psychically for Marci and ended up trapped in Legion's mind. Meanwhile, Moonstar was arrested.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 2}} Upon learning of his former teammates' disappearance, [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]] formed a team to investigate, consisting of [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]], [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]], and [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]]. Cannonball and Sunspot found Karma's unconscious body in a backroom at a bar. Meanwhile, Magik and Magma found Karma's mind inhabiting Legion's body inside a metal box kept in the cellar of a private residence.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 1}}

While the rest of the team was battling Legion's body and numerous evil personas, Magik entered Legion's mind and killed Jack Wayne with her [[Soulsword]]. After finding Karma, Marci brought the girls to the cell holding David. The four then gained possession of a Moira doll and thereby gained control of David's body. Before leaving David's body, however, Karma used Magik's Soulsword to kill the persona who murdered Marci. [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] and [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] arrived soon afterward to help transport Legion and to "clean" the minds of the civilians.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 1|4}}

Once on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], the [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]] along with [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] and [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]], began repairing David's mind by cataloging and trapping the other personalities one by one.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 5}} After [[Charles Ulysses (Earth-616)|General Ulysses]] of the U.S. Marines returned from Limbo, captured the soul gems, and unleashed the Elder Gods, Magik put her plan into action. She sent Karma, armed with the Soulsword, back into Legion's mind, and freed his reality-warping Legion-personality. Legion honored his part of their bargain, using his powers to remove the Elder Gods from reality once and for all.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 1|21}}

===Legion joins the X-Men===
During [[Bastion (Earth-616)|Bastion]]'s [[Second Coming|attacks on the X-Men]], Cyclops asked Professor X to recruit Legion for the battle. Professor X reluctantly agreed and Legion was able to use his various powers to fight [[Nimrod (Earth-10076)|Nimrod Sentinels]] alongside the other X-Men.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 14}}

Not long afterwards, [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Doctor Nemesis]] began killing off Legion's sub-personalities, seemingly without any negative effects.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #244}} However, unbeknownst to Nemesis, Legion's mind created a [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-11326)|powerful new persona]] to protect itself.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #247}} This new persona used it's reality-warping powers to create a [[Earth-11326|world]] where David was a beloved hero.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #247}} David eventually became conscious of the fact that this reality was a fake created by him. He re-absorbed his rogue personality, and used its powers to restore reality to its original state.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 24}}

===Lost Legion===
As a consequence of his restoration of reality, several of David's personas escaped in corporeal bodies. With a small team of X-Men, Legion began to hunt down and reabsorb all of these rogue personas, but while capturing the last one he accidentally absorbed Rogue. Upon releasing her, he suffered a massive shock to his nervous system, leaving him in a coma.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #249|253}}

===Quest for Control===
David recovered from his catatonic state at some point and was seen on the shores of [[Ibiza]], [[Spain]] together with his father. He suffered intense pain - just as many other psychics did - when the Phoenix arrived to claim its host.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #5}}

After waking up, Professor Xavier sent Legion away to a commune for spiritualists in the [[Himalayas]]. Studying under a guru, [[Merzah (Earth-616)|Merzah the Mystic]], David gained a far greater level of control over his powers and split personalities. This would all come tumbling down however, when his father died. The psychic shockwaves caused by his father's death tore down the delicate system of control David had established inside his mind, and caused him to lose control over his powers, leading him to destroy the commune.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 1}}

His various personalities began struggling for control over his body, while David himself hid within his own mind. He received aid from a [[Luca Aldine (Earth-616)|mysterious stranger]], who saved his life, buying David time to subdue one of his rogue personas and claiming its power, telepathy, for himself. Reading the stranger's mind, David detected a great hatred for mutants, and learned of two imprisoned mutant twins in Japan, before the stranger disappeared.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 2}}

David tracked the twins down in Japan, only to learn that they - Karasu-Tengu and Sojobo-Tengu - were not captives but the heirs of one of [[James Logan (Earth-616)|Wolverine's]] enemies, [[Ogun (Ninja) (Earth-616)|Ogun]], a yakuza leader that was told Legion would come to destroy their clan. David was captured, but managed to convince the twins that he meant them no harm, and offered them freedom from the oppressive legacy of their father and the clan's demands of them. The twins accepted his offer to come with him, but the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] arrived, having been deceived by the [[Luca Aldine (Earth-616)|stranger]] into believing David was going to hurt the twins. A fight broke out, and David realized he was endangering the children, prompting him to leave them in the X-Men's care.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 3}} {{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 4}}

===Fighting for Mutantkind===
Seeking to follow the example of his father, but disagreeing with the reactive methods he and the X-Men espoused, David vowed to use his powers proactively, to snuff out threats to mutantkind before they had the chance to strike. David's growing confidence allowed him greater control over his powers, allowing him to subdue stronger personas within his mind. During his battle with the X-Men, David's mind had been invaded by [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]]. She declared herself his nemesis, before kissing him, only to suddenly be ejected by one of his personas. {{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 4}} David became determined to learn more about her, prompting him to make his way into the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School]]. In the process, he learned that the mysterious, mutant-hating stranger that had aided him was in fact Blindfold's brother Luca Aldine, who had stolen some of his sister's powers, and was using them to manipulate David, as his visions of the future had shown him that David would bring about the end of the mutant race. He had also killed Sojobo-Tengu, and used his body as a puppet to allow him the opportunity to kill his sister.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 5}}

David managed to foil the scheme, saving Blindfold's life. The X-Men offered to let him stay with them, but still disagreeing with their methods, he set off on his own. The rogue personality that had kicked Blindfold out of his mind, and had also briefly possessed him during his battle with Luca, made its presence known, assuming the form of David's father, [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]]. David would thenceforth refer to the personality as [[Charles Xavier (Legion Personality) (Earth-616)|the Fiend]]. {{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 6}}  

[[File:David Haller (Earth-616) from X-Men Legacy Vol 1 21.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Legion merged with his personalities]]
In an effort to aid mutantkind, David went in search for the journals of Luca Aldine, containing his visions of how David would bring about the end of the mutant race. He tracked down the group that turned Luca into a rabid mutant-hater and framed them for his summoning of a pack of [[Dire Wraiths]] to serve as a distraction when infiltrating the Jean Grey School. He hid the fact that he had retrieved Luca's journal from Blindfold, with whom he had a burgeoning romance.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 7}} Later he helped a new mutant whose power is to take credit for other people's work, setting him on the path towards happiness.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 8}}
[[File:David Haller (Earth-616), Karasu-Tengu (Earth-616), Sojobo-Tengu (Earth-616) from X-Men Legacy Vol 2 3 0001.png|right|thumb]]

While generally doing good things for the benefit of mutantkind and the world at large, David had issues trusting others. Luca's journals alerted him to the danger posed by [[Aarkus (Earth-616)|Aarkus]], a maddened protector of Earth who was planning to wipe mutantkind from the face of the planet. While on a date with Blindfold on the Moon, near Aarkus' base, David revealed to her that he had telepathically shut Aarkus' mind down, placing him in a coma, while the couple had been having an argument on whether or not David would be justified in doing so. He asked Ruth to take Aarkus to the X-Men, in the hopes that they would be able to heal his mind.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 9}}

After manipulating [[Peter Wisdom (Earth-616)|Pete Wisdom]] into helping him combat anti-mutant sentiment in the [[United Kingdom]], Wisdom had him arrested and turned over to the custody of his mother, [[Gabrielle Haller (Earth-616)||Gabrielle Haller]]. Finally re-united with his mother, David was initially angry with her for abandoning him, but the two reconciled, moments before Gabrielle was killed by a stray bullet aimed for David. David killed the assassins, an anti-mutant despot David had humiliated, and his bodyguard. {{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 16}}

In order draw out and stop Luca, David manipulated [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] by making them think he had come to kill Cyclops to avenge  his father. The scheme worked, as David was able to fool Luca into thinking that the moment when David ended mutantkind had arrived, allowing David to incapacitate him. However, David's trust issues would come back to haunt him. By not informing Cyclops of his plans, he and the X-Men had believed that David had lost control again and was a threat to the world. [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] and the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Cuckoos]] implanted a telepathic virus in David's mind, set to destroy his mind in case the X-Men failed to stop him. Learning too late that David had meant them no harm, the virus ravaged his barely restrained psyche, allowing the Fiend to escape his mind and possess the disembodied form of Luca Aldine. {{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 18}} The Fiend began wreaking havoc on the [[Astral Plane]], enhancing humanity's hatred in subtle ways that escaped the notice of most superheroes, but which would quickly result in the end of the world. {{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 19}}

David survived the virus, and was remanded into [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.'s]] custody. S.W.O.R.D. commander [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]], together with a recovered Aarkus and Karasu Tengu, created a scenario in David's mind, allowing him to not only gain control of his personalities' powers, but to re-absorb them into his core personality. {{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 20}} Realizing how his paranoia and lack of trust had been holding him back, David gradually began reaching out to and re-absorbing his personalities peacefully, in order to gain enough power to destroy the Fiend. {{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 21}} Despite his massive power, David was unable to overcome the Fiend. He subconsciously called out to the X-Men and other heroes that had aided him during his quest to save mutantkind, and they arrived just in time to stop a nuclear attack orchestrated by the Fiend. Together, they were abled to defeat the Fiend, who merged with David.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 22}}

Merging with the Fiend caused David to lose control. Just as he had begun drawing in his different personas, he now began to draw in all mutants on Earth, merging them into a monstrosity that would soon bring about the end of the Earth, unless Ruth could kill him. Ruth's love however, inspired David, allowing him to come to terms with his life of struggles, and allowing him to merge with his final remaining persona [[Weaver (Legion Personality) (Earth-616)|The Weaver]], possessing his powers to warp reality. Now complete, David used his godlike powers to undo the events that had caused him to end mutantkind. He re-wrote reality, attempting to right as many of the wrongs he had brought about, while keeping as much of the good he had accomplished, as possible. Finally, he wrote himself out of reality, leaving Ruth the only person that remembered him.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 24}} 

However, this would not prove to be permanent. Others' memories of him eventually returned, and finally, {{r|Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 2}}{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 7}} so did David himself.{{r|Legion Vol 1 1}}

===Lord Trauma===
After his resurrection, a personality of David's by the name Lord Trauma tried to take over his mind while David was taken into hospital after being found by an Amish couple. David manages to temporarily defeat Lord Trauma and heads to see Dr. Hannah Jones, a psychotherapist known for mainly working with celebrities.<!-- {{r|Legion Vol 1 1}} -->

As David is heading in her direction, Lord Trauma seeks her out and warns her not to treat David and trying to scare her through visual hallucinations. David pulls her out of one of the hallucinations and introduces himself, asking for her help.{{r|Legion Vol 1 1}}

Hannah accepts David's ask for help, and quickly is transported into his mind. Hannah is attacked by creatures sent by Lord Trauma and meets with Tami Haar, another of David's personalities. She leads Hannah away from the creatures and to the ancient cities, structures containing past memories.<!-- {{r|Legion Vol 1 2}} -->

Hannah witnesses a memory where David caused a psychiatric doctor to commit suicide after his temper snapped. Trying to help young David, Hannah and Tami are flung out of the memory by the young David and down to nightmare beach. The pair move past the bitter-sweet spores after Hannah unwittingly touches one and falls sick.<!-- {{r|Legion Vol 1 2}} -->

Back at the hospital, Lord Trauma keeps speaking to David and causes him to unknowingly shout at a patient, causing him to be taken away by security. This episode of paranoia causes his mindscape to become overwhelmed with voices in the form of extreme wind.{{r|Legion Vol 1 2}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Legion witnessed a vision of the future where [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] and his [[Horsemen of Salvation (Earth-616)|Horsemen of Salvation]] attacked the world in order to bring about X-Men's vision for the world. So, Legion took Multiple Man prison so he could make and take control of hundreds of Multiple Man dupes and sent them throughout the world. The dupes wreaked havoc, forcing the X-Men to intervene. When confronted by Jean Grey, Legion told her of his vision. However, it was too late, and the Horsemen of Salvation attacked.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 1|3}}

X-Man fought the X-Men and Legion, who teleported X-Man to a copy of his home reality inside his subconsciousness.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 8}} X-Man saw past the ruse and took control of Legion so he could use his power to kill the X-Men. After deciding nothing would improve with the X-Men around, X-Man made all the X-Men present disappear including Legion, leaving himself alone and unconscious.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 10}}

===Age of X-Man===
Legion and the X-Men who vanished were transported to a [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|different reality]] created by X-Man who attempted to create a utopia where all mutants lived in peace. The mutants sent there had their memories erased so they wouldn't resist.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}

Legion was placed in the [[Danger Room|Danger Room Prison Complex]] and was its most dangerous prisoner. Because of his abilities, he was placed in solitary confinement and not allowed out. He had been the one who has been altering the other prisoners' memories, and he was largely in control of all aspects of the prison.<!-- {{r|Age of X-Man: Prisoner X Vol 1 3}} -->

Legion was found by [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] who was also put in solitary. Bishop said he was crazy, but this was way beyond even David. Legion laughed at Bishop as he said Bishop wouldn't even remember their encounter the following day.{{r|Age of X-Man: Prisoner X Vol 1 3}}

Legion was later freed by X-Man and allowed to return to the real world after deciding to release the mutants he had trapped there.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

===Legion Reborn===
He was later listed as an active member of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], presumably on [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]],{{r|X of Swords Handbook Vol 1 1}} but this turned out to be false.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 1}}

It turned out that David had been captured by [[Orchis (Earth-616)|Orchis]] and had his brain harvested for the use of creating multiple probability scenarios in which to bring down the nation of Krakoa. Now stuck in an astral form, he reached out to [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Kurt]] for a favor in return, as Kurt himself had a psionic coin implanted in his mind and causing him mental distress. David got rid of it in return for Kurt gathering [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] and Doctor Nemesis to help him find his brain and destroy it. After David died at Kurt's hands, his husk was reborn on Krakoa, causing waves of emotion and power that could be felt by the Krakoans all throughout the island. His father, [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]], decided not to put his essence (mind) in his body because he was afraid that David still wasn't stable and could not be controlled. To everyone's surprise, he restored his own mind without the use of [[Cerebro]] after hearing everything that his father had said about him.

[[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] approached him about his plans for his fellow Omega-level mutants during the Hellfire Gala, but he rejected him and his father as he didn't trust either of them or the others on Krakoa due to the numerous secrets he claimed were floating around, with the exception of Kurt. David offered to help Kurt uncover the new secrets and mysteries that had occurred since Krakoa became a nation, revealing that the Patchwork Man was [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]].{{r|Way of X Vol 1 2}}

Legion employed [[Shen Xorn (Earth-616)|Zorn]] and [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]] to follow him around and disintegrate his mind if he ever lost control.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 4}} When [[Alani Ryan (Earth-616)|Loa]] and [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]] sought him out to teach them mental intimacy, like he used to do with Blindfold, he saw this as a good way to trap Onslaught. He allowed Onslaught to invade the mental fusion but he couldn't contain him and he escaped to [[Miranda Leevald (Earth-616)|Stacy X]]'s orphanage where he caused a fight between [[Lost (Earth-616)|Lost]] and [[Fabian Cortez (Earth-616)|Fabian Cortez]].{{r|Way of X Vol 1 3}}

David took the twins with him when he met with his father at the [[Green Lagoon]], the meeting was tense and aggressive with David admitting he loved his dad but refusing to tell him anything about his recent attempts to stop Onslaught. The meeting was cut short when Onslaught possessed everyone in the bar and tried to attack David and the twins and they casually disintegrated them all with their combined powers before leaving.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 4}} When resurrected with no memory of being possessed, Xavier went to [[Mars (Planet)|Planet Arakko]] to confront his son about his behavior and tell him not to return to Krakoa but David ignored him because he was trying to contact Nightcrawler telepathically. They were almost crushed when [[Phobos (Moon)|Phobos]] fell out of orbit but were saved by Nightcrawler.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 5}}

Originally, all of Legion's powers were psychically based, but since his resurrection Legion has also manifested physical mutations. Also, since his return, Legion's mind is shown as being inhabited by thousands of sub-personalities.

Some of Legion's persona's are in fact individual psyche absorbed by Legion upon their deaths (i.e. [[Marci Sabol (Earth-616)|Marci Sabol]] and [[Jemail Karami (Earth-616)|Jemail Karami]]), but many more are creations of Legion's own mind.

It is likely that after a sub-personality is killed or reabsorbed that Legion retains their powers, though this has not been confirmed.

However, killed personas were seen alive after their apparent death, such as [[Clown (Legion Personality) (Earth-616)|The Clown]] and [[Jack Wayne (Legion Personality) (Earth-616)|Jack Wayne]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy #250}}

One was [[telekinetic]], one was [[telepathic]], one was [[pyrokinetic]]. This was later expanded to an [[:Category:Legion Subpersonalities|unnamed number of personalities]], possibly thousands, all with a unique power.{{r|{{cl|New Mutants Vol 1 25}}-[[New Mutants Vol 1 28|28]]}}
