===Assassin Ninja===
[[File:Kwannon (Earth-616) from Fallen Angels Vol 2 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|Kwannon's child is taken from her.]]
Raised to be an assassin ninja by the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]], Kwannon was baptized as such to be "the enemy of peace". After falling in love with a boy and giving birth to a daughter, she displeased her masters, who in turn killed her lover and took her daughter away from her, as a lesson of mercy.{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 1}} As a mutant telepath, she built herself a notorious reputation as a killer who could "hear thoughts", being a loyal member of her clan.{{r|Psylocke Vol 1 1}}{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 2}} However, after years of psychological torture, Kwannon turned against her masters and assassinated them, finally breaking free.{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 5}}

Kwannon eventually became the prime assassin of Japanese crime lord [[Nyoirin Henecha (Earth-616)|Nyoirin]] as well as the lover of [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba (Earth-616)|Matsu'o Tsurayaba]], a high-ranking member of the Hand. When the interests of Nyoirin and the Hand came into conflict, Kwannon was honor-bound to face her lover in combat. During the battle, she fell from an ocean cliff and suffered injuries that left her brain-damaged. No hope for recovery was left for a comatose Kwannon, much to Tsurayaba's dismay.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 31}}

===Body Swap===
[[File:Kwannon (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 31 001.png|thumb|right|Operating as Lord Nyoirin's prime assassin]]
Shortly thereafter, the telepathic X-Man [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Betsy Braddock, a.k.a. Psylocke]], was found washed up on the shore of the Hand's island base in the South China Sea after passing through the [[Siege Perilous]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 255}} To save Kwannon, Tsurayaba sought the help of the sorceress [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]], a begrudging servant of [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]] (who had shown a marked interest in Psylocke prior to these events). Tsurayaba believed that Kwannon's limited psychic powers would allow her mind to withstand contact with a high-level telepath like Psylocke. Spiral, penchant for trickery and deception, transferred the two women's minds into each other's bodies, instead of simply recovering Kwannon.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 32}} Believing Psylocke was Kwannon, Tsurayaba attampted to manipulate her into becoming the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]]'s second-in-command. However, an encounter with [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] enabled her to break free of his mind control and rejoin the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 256|258}}

[[File:Kwannon (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 22 001.png|thumb|left|After her body swap with Psylocke]]
Meanwhile, Kwannon was recovered by her employer Nyoirin with the assistance of Spiral. The merge of bodies and minds between the two women led Kwannon to believe that she was truly Betsy Braddock. After months under Nyoirin's care, she was sent to the [[United States of America|United States]] to confront Psylocke.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 17|18}} As she infiltrated the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|X-Mansion]] and attacked Psylocke, the X-Men intervened. Kwannon (now assuming the codename "Revanche") claimed that Psylocke was not the real Betsy Braddock, but an impostor.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 20}} The other X-Men were unable to determine the true identities of the two women. According to Wolverine, their scents were identical, and Psylocke, subject to manipulation many times in the past, was unwilling to allow [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] to telepathically probe her mind in search of the truth. The X-Men then left for [[Japan]] to uncover the truth.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 22}} Reading Nyoirin's diary, they that Kwannon was supposedly the first person to happen upon the unconscious Betsy Braddock after her re-emergence from the Siege Perilous portal. Amnesiac and disoriented, Psylocke's telepathy ran unchecked and fused the two women's minds together.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 22}} Confronted by the X-Men, Nyoirin told them to search for Tsurayaba, but, as he was found, he revealed nothing about what had truly transpired.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 23}}

===Death===
[[File:Kwannon (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 31 002.png|thumb|right|100px|Asking Matsu'o to mercy kill her]]
Revanche returned to [[New York City|New York]] with the X-Men, becoming member of the team, much to Psylocke's discomfort.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 24}} During a mission to an island which housed a colony of [[Legacy Virus]] victims, Revanche revealed she had also contracted the deadly disease.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 2 2}} As the disease progressed,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 27|28}} her telepathic powers were slowly enhanced, allowing her to cut through the confusion and distortion of her own memories. Certain of her real identity, Kwannon chose to leave the X-Men, but not before forcibly removing the bionic eyes Mojo had implanted in Braddock's body years before, severing her connection with Spiral.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 30}} Finding her back in Japan and close to death, Kwannon asked Tsurayaba to end her life swiftly, so she would die of her own will and not as a victim of the disease. Matsu'o Tsurayaba killed Revanche with a tant≈ç.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 31}} As she died, she left a portion of her psionic energies within Tsurayaba, which allowed him restore Psylocke's mind and memories, making her full again. Kwannon's epitaph read "Kwannon, love that transcended body and soul".{{r|X-Men Vol 2 32}}

===Return===
When Braddock was attacked by the psychic vampire [[Sapphire Styx (Earth-616)|Sapphire Styx]], who absorbed her soul into herself,{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor Vol 1 1}}, her unconscious body was left apparently lifeless.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor Vol 1 2}} After Psylocke managed to recreate her original body, her previous body was later reanimated, inhabited by Kwannon once again.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor Vol 1 4}}

[[File:Kwannon (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 16 001.png|thumb|left|Decapitating Joseph]]
Kwannon's path would cross the X-Men again when the X-Men took on the latest incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] that reappeared in [[East Transia]]. As the X-Men found out that their leader, [[Magneto]], was actually the clone [[Joseph (Earth-616)|Joseph]], Kwannon killed him with her katana. She then claimed to the X-Men she was trying to remember them and that she was "nothing", as translated by Wolverine from Japanese. She alleged that she had killed Joseph because he was manipulated into being weapon to be used to erase mutants from the world.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 16}}

Though the X-Men incarcerated her in their [[Harry's Hideaway|hideout]], Kwannon was soon freed by Wolverine, who wanted her help in avenging [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]]'s death. Kwannon tracked Wolfsbane's killers and shared their memories with Wolverine, who in turn killed them after a brief confrontation against [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O.N.E.]] agents.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 17}} She also assisted Wolverine in a fight against [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]'s new [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]], being defeated by [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 19|20}}

===Krakoa===
Claiming the codename "Psylocke" for herself, Kwannon became a citizen of the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], which she considered a peaceful paradise that had no place for her. There, she experienced the apparent murder of her long lost daughter by a threatening artificial intelligence called [[Apoth (Earth-616)|Apoth]]. Since Krakoa was on a severe lockdown after the murder of Professor X, Psylocke turned to [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] for help in reaching Apoth. She recruited [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] and [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] for her mission and the group learned in Japan that Apoth was using children to disseminate a technological drug called Overclock. Sanctioned by Sinister, Psylocke promised to bring Apoth to him if her mission was kept hidden from the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council of Krakoa]].{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 1}} The group then found Apoth in [[Brazil]], where Psylocke communed with Apoth and learned that, back when she worked as an assassin, she was responsible for its conception.{{r|{{cl|Fallen Angels Vol 2 2}}-[[Fallen Angels Vol 2 4|4]]}} Sinister modified Overclock to allow Psylocke to interact with Apoth on a cyberspace. Psylocke killed Apoth and, as promised, delivered its remains to Mister Sinister.{{r|{{cl|Fallen Angels Vol 2 5}}-[[Fallen Angels Vol 2 6|6]]}}

Following the Apoth incident, Psylocke was assigned to monitor Mister Sinister's new team of [[Hellions (Essex) (Earth-616)|Hellions]], composed of mutants who were too violent or troubled to be around the rest of the Krakoans. Their first mission led them to taking down [[State Home for Foundlings|Mister Sinister's orphanage]], which was a cover for Sinister's still active [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] cloning farm.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 1}} When Kwannon and the Hellions arrived, they were met by the [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Goblin Queen]] and her perverse Marauders, who she had been magically and psychically torturing. After a swift defeat, most of the Hellions were captured, except for Psylocke and [[Kyle Gibney (Earth-616)|Wild Child]], who had the urge to attack her after believing she was faulting as the alpha of their "pack". After his quick defeat, Kwannon stabbed him with her psychic knife and broke his neck, forcing him to accept her as the one in charge.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 2|3}} Psylocke then managed to free her fellow Hellions, and the Goblin Queen was shot dead by [[John Greycrow (Earth-616)|Greycrow]], allowing the rest of the Hellions to escape safely to Krakoa.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 4}}

[[File:Kwannon (Earth-616) from Hellions Vol 1 6 001.png|right|thumb|150px|Abandoning the Hellions on Arakko]]
Before the start of a [[X of Swords|sword tournament]], that was set up to settle matters between Krakoa and [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]], the Hellions were tasked with infiltrating and sabotaging Arakko's forces. There, they learned not only that the contest had already started as they brutally fought the [[Locus Vile (Earth-616)|Locus Vile]] but also that their mission was a ruse. During the fight, Mister Sinister manipulated Psylocke into abandoning the Hellions in Arakko and return to Krakoa with DNA samples of the Locus Vile, something he intended to do since the very beginning. As she arrived in Krakoa, she was murdered by Mister Sinister as a way to cover his deceiving actions.{{r|{{cl|Hellions Vol 1 5}}-[[Hellions Vol 1 6|6]]}} After being [[Resurrection Protocols|resurrected]], most of the Hellions questioned Sinister's take on Arakko, but he was fiercely defended by Psylocke. It was then revealed that her loyalty came from the fact that Mister Sinister recovered Psylocke's daughter, now living a cybernetic existence, from the Apoth's remains she had delivered to him.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 7}}

Later on, Psylocke's loyalty was tested again when Mister Sinister arranged for the Hellions to be kidnapped by [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] and tortured by [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Mastermind]] as part of a trick to make Arcade a mental slave and take over his [[Murderworld]] clone farm, where Mister Sinister would be able to make clones without the Quiet Council's knowledge. In a nightmarish mental trap, Mastermind forced Kwannon to believe she had spent decades of her life being constantly hunted by Braddock. After Arcade was defeated and the Hellions were set free with no memories about what had really transpired, Mister Sinister told Psylocke he was working to restore her daughter in Arcade's Murderworld. If Psylocke ever told the Quiet Council about Mister Sinister's activities, they would have his research destroyed, including her daughter. With no choice, Psylocke watched as Sinister and Mastermind sent the Hellions home believing they had escaped on their own.{{r|{{cl|Hellions Vol 1 9}}-[[Hellions Vol 1 11|11]]}}

Having worked through her anger in this mental simulation,{{r|Hellions Vol 1 12}} Psylocke would later team up with [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] when Braddock went missing after her fight against [[Isca (Earth-616)|Isca the Unbeaten]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 18}} When [[Elspeth Braddock (Earth-13059)|Elspeth Braddock]] retrieved Braddock's spirit, [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] attempted to perform a ritual to return her to her body. When this failed, Psylocke set Braddock's spirit free and chased her mind down in [[Avalon (Otherworld)|Avalon]]. As the two women met, they finally had the opportunity to disucuss their sorrowful connection. As Psylocke offered to temporarily host Braddock's psyche once again, Braddock was fully resurrected. Excalibur then learned that Braddock's body had been previously possessed by [[Alice MacAllister (Earth-616)|Malice]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 19}} Psylocke, with newfound sympathy for Malice's situation, tracked her down on Krakoa and eventually fought her in a telepathic battle that ended with Psylocke killing her by destroying her necklace. Malice was then revived in a new body and had a second chance at life.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 20}}

Psylocke's growing, unspoken resentment for Mister Sinister reached a breaking point when the team were attacked again by the Locus Vile, who had come to Krakoa to retrieve the DNA samples Essex had stolen from them.{{r|Hellions Vol 1  13}} [[Tarn (Locus Vile) (Earth-616)|Tarn the Uncaring]] revealed to the whole team that Sinister had misled them. As the Hellions tried to attack Mister Sinister, he unleashed an army of clones as a distraction and left with [[Nathaniel Essex (Locus Vile) (Earth-616)|the clone he had sent to Amenth]] through an illegal gate to Murderworld that only he could access, leaving Psylocke back in anger and defeat.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 14}} 

Psylocke shared the truth about the Murderworld mission, and, after evading the Locus Vile, the Hellions went to confront Sinister in his spare clone lab. Though [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] and Greycrow wanted to destroy the facility, Psylocke begged them not to, finally sharing the truth about her daughter. However, [[Manuel de la Rocha (Earth-616)|Empath]] intervened and, under [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]'s orders, caused Havok to bring Psylocke's only chance of getting her daughter back to the ground.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 15}} Pulled out of the wreckage by the X-Men, the team returned to Krakoa for healing. After the Quiet Council planned to cover up Mister Sinister's wrongdoings for his relevance to the mutant society, Psylocke decided to give up on Krakoa and the Hellions, aiming to continue life as an assassin looking for death.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 16}}

| Powers                  = '''Telepathy:''' As a [[Homo superior|mutant]], Psylocke displays telepathic abilities which enable her to read minds, communicate with others by broadcasting her thoughts psychically and other talents. Originally, she had low-level empathic/telepathic abilities.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 32}} After having her body switched with Betsy Braddock, contracting the Legacy Virus and being a member of the X-Men, her powers developed significantly.
* '''Psychic Katana/Knife:''' In Betsy Braddock's body, she physically manifested her telepathic powers as a blade, created as an ornate psionic katana. The blade could disrupt the autonomic nervous systems of other living beings, incapacitating them instantly.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 20}} Kwannon could also use her psychic katana to force her way into an opponent's mind and reveal any thoughts that were originally shielded from her telepathic powers, including those of other telepaths.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 22}} After returning to her original body, she altered such a manifestation to one similar to Betsy's psychic knife, the focused totality of her powers.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor Vol 1 4}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 16}}{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 1}}
* '''Telepathic Detection:''' With her psionic senses, Psylocke can track other sentient beings by their psionic emanations. She did this to locate Wolfsbane's killers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 17}}
'''Telekinesis:''' On various occasions, Psylocke has demonstrated mid-level telekinesis, enabling her to levitate, move and manipulate objects and matter with her mind.{{r|{{cl|Hellions Vol 1 5}}-[[Hellions Vol 1 6|6]]}}{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 6}}
* '''Flight:''' Psylocke can use her psychic powers to levitate and even fly at higher speeds. She floats in the air when meditating{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 1}} and once created a pair of psionic butterfly wings to fly a longer distance.{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 6}}

| Abilities               = '''Master Martial Artist:''' Psylocke is highly skilled in different ninja fighting techniques and other martial arts, including sword fighting, as she was trained from very tender age and worked as an assassin for years.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 21}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 31}}{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 1}}{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 2}}

| Trivia                  = * The name "Kwannon" (Ë¶≥Èü≥, in Kanji character) is an archaic transliteration of her namesake, the bodhisattva of mercy, which would be rendered as "Kan'non" in current Japanese, pronounced as [kanÀêo…¥].{{r|wikipedia:Guanyin}}
* The name "Revanche" ([…π…ôÀàv…ëÃÉ É]) is not simply an alternate derivative of the word "revenge," but rather means a "policy designed to recover lost territory or status."{{r|wikipedia:Revanchism}} From French origin, it is pronounced as [ Å…ôÀàv…ëÃÉ É] in French.
* The name "Psylocke" ([Ààsa…™.l…ëÀêk] SEYE-lok) is assumed by some fans to be a wordplay with the words "psyche", "key" and "lock". As "psyche" is pronounced as "psy-key", "Psylocke" would be pronounced as "psy-lock".

|Overview = The woman named '''Kwannon''' by the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] was raised from birth to be a killer.{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 1}} As one of [[Japan]]'s top assassins, she ultimately abandoned the Hand and became the top operative of the crime boss [[Nyoirin Henecha (Earth-616)|Lord Nyoirin]]. This brought her into conflict with her lover and rival, Hand assassin [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba (Earth-616)|Matsu'o Tsurayaba]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 31}} 

After she nearly died in battle with Matsu'o, the Hand had Kwannon's body switched with that of [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Betsy Braddock]], the X-Man Psylocke.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 255}} Confused and believing herself to be Braddock, Kwannon took the codename '''Revanche''' and joined the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 20|22}} After discovering her true nature, she contracted the lethal [[Legacy Virus]]{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 2 2}}  and was mercy-killed by Matsu'o at her request. Braddock continued to live in Kwannon's body.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 31|32}} 

When Braddock was apparently killed by [[Sapphire Styx (Earth-616)|Sapphire Styx]], she telekinetically rebuilt her original body, and Kwannon was somehow resurrected in her own.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor Vol 1 4}} Kwannon soon became an ally to the X-Men once more, joining them on [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. There she claimed the codename '''Psylocke''', while Braddock became the new [[Captain Britain]] of [[Earth-616]].{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 2 1}} Forging an uneasy alliance with [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Sinister]] for the sake of her daughter, Kwannon took on a leadership role as the supervisor of  his troubled charges, the new [[Hellions (Essex) (Earth-616)|Hellions]].{{r|Hellions Vol 1 1}} After [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] became unable to fulfill his duties, she became a member of the [[Great Captains of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Great Captains of Krakoa]] in his place.{{r|Inferno Vol 1 1}}}}
