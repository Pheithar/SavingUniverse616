| History                 = Crosta is a member of the [[Homo mermanus]] race better known as Atlanteans. The Homo mermanus just like their cousins the [[Homo sapiens]] have [[Mutants]] born within their society. Crosta was secreted away by his mother, [[Proctidae (Earth-616)|Proctidae]], after the abandonment of [[Atlantis]], his father [[Opistho (Earth-616)|Opistho]] eventually discovered it. Proctidae brought the affair to the attention of their King [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] in order to keep the boy, as Opistho engaged a paternity suit.

When his mutant powers emerged he was ordered by Namor to attend a mutant school in [[San Francisco]] ([[Graymalkin Industries]], current home of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]), rather than remain with his mother or join his father in [[Latveria]] with the Atlantean military, he violently rejected the idea, attacking Namor. Reined in by Namor, he was sent to the X-Men.{{r|Dark Reign: The Cabal #1}}

Once the mutants were let free to go, he left, intending to return to [[Atlantis]].{{r|Avengers Academy #29|31}}
