===Stryker's gathering===
After [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|William Stryker]] killed his family, he started a mission to rid the world of all mutants. Stryker knew he could not do this task on his own, so he traveled around and recruited many mutant hating people to join his mission. Stryker was later stopped and sent to prison, but his followers, now called the Purifiers, kept on going.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #5}}

===[[Decimation]]===
William Stryker later returned as a major player right at the start of [[Decimation|M-Day]]. Deeming the sudden massive reduction in number of the mutant population a sign of God, he went on TV and declared "He made the first step and now we have to take the next".{{Citation}}

With the help of [[Joshua Guthrie (Earth-616)|Icarus]], one of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]]'s students, he caused a bus to explode, killing about 1/4th of the de-powered students from the academy. Then he planned the assassination of [[Laurie Collins (Earth-616)|Wallflower]], ordering one of his Purifier snipers to shoot her in the head. Next he tried to kill [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]]. [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] became suspicious and went under cover as Dust, getting shot herself. The deaths of Wallflower and Dust were Stryker's prime objectives, as he had been informed by [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] that both girls would be fundamental in the destruction of the Purifiers. Finally he attacked the institute with his Purifiers, killing [[Maxwell Jordan (Earth-616)|Quill]], leaving [[Sidney Green (Earth-616)|Onyxx]] and [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]] critically wounded, and hurting [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] and other students. After Stryker's Purifiers were defeated, he was killed by the enraged boyfriend of Wallflower, [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]].{{Citation}}

The Purifiers would later manage to acquire Stryker's remains from the authorities.{{Citation}}

===[[Messiah Complex]]===
The Purifiers attempted the kill the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|first mutant baby]] born after M-Day. They attacked the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] in Cooperstown, [[Alaska (State)|Alaska]], killing [[Michael Baer (Earth-616)|Blockbuster]] and [[Prism (Robbie) (Earth-616)|Prism]], but failed to kill the baby.{{r|X-Men: Messiah Complex Vol 1 1}} After being infiltrated by [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]], the group was attacked by the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]], who were seeking to prove their worth to the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. With the assistance of the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]], the New X-Men were nearly massacred, barely escaping.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 44}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 205}}

===Bastion and the Human Council===
Following those events, they managed to find and resurrect [[Bastion (Earth-616)|Bastion]], who then harvested the remains of [[Magus (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Magus]] and injected them into several living and dead known mutant killers ([[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]], [[Leper Queen (Earth-616)|Leper Queen]], William Stryker, [[Stephen Lang (Earth-616)|Stephen Lang]], [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]], [[Graydon Creed (Earth-616)|Graydon Creed]], and [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar Trask]]), turning them all into [[Technarch]]/human hybrids and "resurrecting" the dead members, much to [[Matthew Risman (Earth-616)|Matthew Risman]]'s objections. These people were then made into an inner circle of leadership for the Purifiers.{{Citation}}

===Internal conflict===
Meanwhile, the Purifiers used a brainwashed [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]] to attack [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]] and obtain his wings, which, even though they appeared to be fully organic, were still composed of [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]]'s techno-organic strain. Using the sample, the Purifiers employed a scientist named [[Adam Harkins (Earth-616)|Adam Harkins]] to duplicate the strain and use it to create an elite team of Purifiers called "[[Choir (Earth-616)|the Choir]]". After learning that Bastion was planning to remove Risman from the group's leadership, Risman led the Choir against Bastion's Purifiers in an attempt to destroy Bastion and the reanimated remains of Stryker, considering them unholy. Archangel later attacked the Purifiers in an attempt to reclaim the wings that were stolen from him, killing every member of the Choir. During that point, Matthew Risman was shot in the head by X-23 around the point where Matthew tried to kill Bastion.{{Citation}}

===[[Fear Itself]]===
...{{r|Fear Itself: Uncanny X-Force #1|3}}-->

Following the [[Fear Itself|Serpent's War]], Purifiers were seen tracking [[Jimmy Marks (Earth-616)|Hybrid]] in [[Los Angeles]]. When the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]] came, they tried to explain the threat of their target, but were all killed by the Dire Wraith/mutant hybrid before making the Avengers believe they committed suicide to avoid capture.{{r|Avengers Academy #23}}

===[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]===
After the conflict pitting the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] against the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], the Purifiers, now equipped with heavily armored and armed exoskeletons, attacked the transport truck carrying [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], but they were defeated by the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] members ([[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]], [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]], [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], and [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|The Thing]]) escorting it. They were then arrested by the [[San Francisco Police Department (Earth-616)|San Francisco Police Department]]. Though unsuccessful, their attack managed to make Luke Cage quit the Avengers and focus on his family.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 30}}

Later, the same heavily equipped Purifiers targeted [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] in [[Miami]], only to be defeated by [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|Cyclops' X-Men]] and the [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|time-displaced X-Men]].

The X-Men then tracked those Purifiers, locating them in [[Ocala]], [[Florida (State)|Florida]]. Attacking them, they were all taken down by the Purifiers' leader [[Jason Stryker (Earth-616)|Jason Stryker]].{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 19|20}}
