===Early life===
'''Eric Brooks''' was born in [[Soho (London)|Soho]], [[London (England)|London]], on the 24th October 1922.{{r|Blade Vol 3 3}} His father, [[Lucas Cross (Earth-616)|Lucas Cross]], a member of the secret society the [[Order of Tyrana (Earth-616)|Order of Tyrana]], sent his pregnant wife Tara to [[England]] before he was taken prisoner in [[Latveria]]. There she took the name "Vanessa Brooks" and found shelter with brothel owner Madame Vanity, another member of the Order of Tyrana.{{r|Blade Vol 4 6}} Experiencing labor complications, Tara was forced to seek a doctor's assistance. The doctor, [[Deacon Frost (Earth-616)|Deacon Frost]], was actually a ravenous [[Vampires|vampire]] and feasted on the woman as she gave birth, passing on a series of enzymes that altered her baby. The enzymes entered the infant's bloodstream, transforming him into a being tainted by a vampire's kiss, but not converted. In other words half-human, half-vampire also called a [[Dhampir]]. Frost was driven away before he could slay the child, but Tara perished, leaving the orphaned Eric Brooks to be raised at Madame Vanity's brothel.{{r|Blade Vol 4 1}}

===Training===
While he was growing up on the street of London, he ran into American veteran Vampire Slayer, [[Jamal Afari (Earth-616)|Jamal Afari]] and saved him from being killed by vampires with a grudge against the old man. Afari soon learned about Eric and his origins and decided to take him under his wing, becoming his mentor and foster-father and helping him to control his powers. Afari taught Eric everything he knew about hunting, fighting, and killing vampires.

Determined to avenge his mother's death, Eric fashioned himself into a vampire hunter like Afari while still a teenager and started calling himself '''Blade''', after the sharp weapons with which he used to kill vampires. Finally, Blade and Afari split up when Jamal willingly took the fall for murder when Blade killed a man (who was suffering from a derangement), whom he mistook for a vampire.{{r|Marvel Preview #3}}

===1968===
After stalking the night on his own for a number of years, Blade became a part of a small band of like-minded individuals hunting [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]] consisting of [[Musenda (Earth-616)|Musenda]], [[Orji Jones (Earth-616)|Orji]], [[Ogun Strong (Earth-616)|Ogun]], and [[Azu M'Dammen (Earth-616)|Azu]]. Blade went to Dracula and told him he represented a group of men who believed that in another sixty years vampires would rule the world, and that realizing humanity had no chance against their "superior," Blade would offer his and his associates assistance to carry on Dracula's bidding during the daytime. Blade further enticed Dracula with this idea telling him that they had facilitated a plan that would speed up global conquest by vampires to only ten years. Intrigued, Dracula agreed to go with Blade to meet his associates. Dracula met these associates: Ogun, Azu, Musenda, and Orji. However, Dracula would soon find that this was all a trap and that they were really a group of vampire killers. They nearly succeeded in destroying Dracula by driving a stake into his heart. It was during this battle that Blade's companion would try out wooden knives of his own design and find that they work just as well as stakes. However, Dracula soon was resurrected by his servants and exacted revenge by murdering the band of vampire hunters, leaving only Musenda and Blade alive.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #30}}

===Mighty Avengers (1970's)===
On November 7, 1972, the murder of a bat-like monster in New York brought Blade's attention. When looking for the corpse in a morgue, he discovered [[Kaluu (Earth-616)|Kaluu]] investigating the body with magic, and attacked him believing him to be a vampire and an enemy. As soon as detective [[James Lucas (Earth-616)|James Lucas]], [[Constance Molina (Earth-616)|Constance Molina]], and [[Adam Brashear (Earth-616)|Adam Brashear]] arrived at the scene, the fight was stopped when Blade realized he was among allies. They started investigating the murder as soon as [[Bear (Hybrid) (Earth-616)|The Bear]] appeared, and presented herself as the killer of that creature, in self-defense, as she wanted to prevent the [[Deathwalkers (Earth-616)|Deathwalkers]] from using it for a sacrifice.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 11}}

The Bear explained that she herself was the result of a failed attempt of the Deathwalkers to extinguish humanity in 1908 and that they would try to do it again. With the mystery solved, the people present formed the [[Mighty Avengers (1970s) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]], and went to find the Deathwalkers. Kaluu tracked down the magic they used in the were-bat to a secret subway below the City Hall. The Mighty Avengers then attacked the Deathwalkers before they could make their sacrifice. After Blade recovered the Talisman of Kamar-Taj, which was required to perform the sacrifice, Adam Brashear caused the subway to collapse above the Deathwalkers. With the Deathwalkers stopped, the team disbanded.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 12}}

===Tomb of Dracula===
[[File:Eric Brooks (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 3 1 0001.jpg|left|100px|thumb|Blade in his original costume.]]
Blade pressed on, often fighting alongside a team led by [[Quincy Harker (Earth-616)|Quincy Harker]], the great vampire hunter. The company's members included [[Rachel van Helsing (Earth-616)|Rachel van Helsing]] and [[Frank Drake (Earth-616)|Frank Drake]].{{r|Tomb of Dracula #10}} Blade and the team battled Dracula and attempted to kill him and rescue [[Elizabeth Langley (Earth-616)|Elizabeth Langley]].{{r|Tomb of Dracula #12}} Blade and the hunters chased Dracula across Europe. After being attacked by his thralls they reached Dracula's mortuary. The team managed to outnumber him, and eventually Blade got close enough to the vampire lord to stake him through the heart, effectively killing Dracula.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #13}}{{r|Tomb of Dracula #15}}However his death was short-lived and he was resurrected by his minions.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #14}} Blade attempted to once more slay Dracula. Dracula managed to overpower Blade and fed upon the vampire hunter before leaving him for dead.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #17}} Quincy Harker came across the body of Blade, and seeing that he had been bitten by Dracula, and him to be dead. Quincy Harker got a stake out and prepared to ram it through Blade's heart.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #18}} Before Quincy could strike, Blade suddenly revived and to Quincy's surprise, Blade has not changed into a vampire. Blade explained that he is immune to vampire bites due to the fact that his mother was bitten by a vampire while Blade was being born. Blade vowed to use his immunity to his advantage.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #19}} They traveled to London, and at Quincy's home he tried to convince Blade to stay and continue their quest to destroy Dracula. Blade declined the offer, feeling that he should get back on the case of the vampire responsible for killing his mother.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #21}} Blade returned to the flat that he shared with [[Safron Caulder (Earth-616)|Safron]] to find that a vampire had broken in and was attempting to feed upon his girlfriend. Blade easily destroyed her attacker. A friend, [[Trudy Taylor (Earth-616)|Trudy]], explained what happened and Blade agreed to go out looking for Dracula. After putting on his vampire hunting gear, Blade went out into the night and was soon attacked by Dracula in his bat form. Dracula knocked him down into the street with a car speeding toward him. Blade battled Dracula across the city, their fight took them to a sporting goods store. Dracula was forced to retreat when Blade managed to partially impale the vampire lord in the chest with a broken ski pole, and then later with one of his wooden daggers. With the battle over, [[Scotland Yard]] let Blade walk away from the scene, and he returned home to Safron and Trudy rest and told them he would explain everything in the morning.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #24}}	

When Dracula traveled to Boston, Blade was also there tracking down the vampire who killed his mother. Blade attacked the Vampire but was easily stopped in his tracks by Dracula who demanded that Blade accompany him back to Harold's home to meet with Quincy Harker. Dracula explained he has nothing to do with the murders and that the coven is acting on their own. Blade had no interest in getting involved in their battle with Dr. Sun as he came to destroy the vampire who killed his mother. When Dr. Sun was about to kill Dracula Blade arrived and offered assistance in killing Dr. Sun.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #41}} The two work together and destroy Dr. Sun. But after the fight Blade threatened Dracula telling him that if he does not help him find his mothers killer he would die by his hands.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #42}} Dracula refused to be ordered around, leading to a battle between the two.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #43}}

===Hannibal King===
Blade, still looking for his mother's killer, found a clue leading to their apartment. Blade attacked the occupant, but the vampire was revealed to be [[Hannibal King (Earth-616)|Hannibal King]], the vampire detective.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #44}} Hannibal easily defeated Blade but due to their mutual mission, they decided to work together. They waited in Frost's apartment for his recent victim to rise as a vampire. When he awoke, he explained that he had dug up a coffin containing an exact copy of Blade.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #45}} Blade and Hannibal King continued their hunt for Deacon Frost, they wondered how Frost intended to take over the world with a duplicate of Blade.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #46}} Blade and King went to London so Blade could visit Safron.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #47}} 

===Doppelgänger===
Blade and King found the "[[Eric Brooks (Doppelganger) (Earth-616)|Doppelgänger]]" and he revealed that he was created to destroy the original.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #48}} The two fought, but Blade stopped when the two began to fuse together on contact. Hannibal King tried to rush to Blade's rescue, however, he was too late to stop the merger from completing. With the vampire doppelgänger in full control of their unified body, it set its sights on King.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #49}} The Doppelgänger attacked King, and despite his savage fury, he is easily fought off by King who stabbed the faux-Blade in the chest with one of his own wooden daggers, defenestrating the imitator, allowing Hannibal to escape.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #50}} King fled from the vampire doppelgänger of Blade and their fight crashed into Dracula's party with Deacon Frost in attendance. Furious of Blade's interruption of his party, Dracula attacked and was shocked to find his longtime vampire hunter foe to be a vampire himself.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #51}} Blade appears to have the upper hand when he stabs Dracula in the back with one of his wooden daggers. However, Dracula turns around, and mocking the fake Blade's inferior skill to the original impaled the vampire doppelgänger in the chest with a stake, killing him.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #53}}
[[File:Eric Brooks (Earth-616) from Blade Vol 2 2 0001.gif|thumb|right|200px|"Daywalker"]]
===Nightstalkers===
The agency discontinued after Drake left and Blade was committed to a psychiatric hospital following a battle with a temporarily resurrected Dracula. [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] later arranged the release of Blade so that he could join Drake and King in reforming Borderline Inc. as the [[Nightstalkers (Earth-616)|Nightstalkers]].

The mother of all demons, [[Lilith (Earth-616)|Lilith]], hired Blade's agency to kill Ghost Rider -- the leather-clad, motorcycle-riding Spirit of Vengeance -- and bad-boy Johnny Blaze, the fiery skeleton's former host. After a protracted battle, Blade and company realized they had been duped. The team joined with Ghost Rider and Blaze against Lilith, battling her monstrous minion [[Meatmarket (Earth-616)|Meatmarket]].{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 28}} Blade, Drake, and King continued their partnership with Ghost Rider and Blaze. Along with Dr. Strange, [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]] the Living Vampire, and the [[Darkhold Redeemers]], they formed the [[Midnight Sons]], a group dedicated to preserving the boundaries between our world and the dark realms. The Midnight Sons clashed with Lilith and her demonspawn, the [[Lilin]], in a supernatural contest with Earth as the prize. The Midnight Sons proved victorious, destroying Lilith and her brood.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 31}} Blade also rescued his close friend [[Safron Caulder (Earth-616)|Safron Caulder]] from the [[Darkholders (Earth-616)|Darkholders]].{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #6}}

Blade's desire to destroy supernatural enemies led him to be tricked into using the [[Darkhold]]. As 'Switchblade' he attacked a number of supernatural beings and stole their power in the 'Midnight Massacre'. Eventually, Blade was stopped and another page of the Darkhold was used to restore things back to normal.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 40}}

The Nightstalkers also battled other threats, such as [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s [[Department of Occult Armaments (Earth-616)|D.O.A. (Department of Occult Armaments)]].{{r|Nightstalkers #2|4}}

Upon the eventual weakening of the [[Montesi Formula]], and the return of vampires, Blade encountered and staked a former ally, a now-vampiric [[Taj Nital (Earth-616)|Taj Nital]]. Blade, Drake, and King, who again had become afflicted with vampirism, began their crusade anew to cleanse the world of all bloodsuckers. Blade and his partners clashed with dread lord [[Varnae (Earth-616)|Varnae]], the supposedly first vampire and the demon who had visited the hellish curse upon men. King and Drake were slain in a bloody and futile battle. The loss of his compatriots only strengthened Blade's resolve to rid the world of vampires, regardless of the circumstances of their creation. Following their victory, King was cured of his vampirism. Subsequently, he and King formed a private-investigation firm.{{r|Nightstalkers #18}}	

===Dracula Returns===
Deacon Frost teamed up with [[Marie Laveau (Earth-616)|Marie Laveau]] to take over organized crime in [[New Orleans]] as a staging area for greater conquests. Blade was alerted by [[John Carik (Earth-616)|Bible John]], and the two fought Dracula and later Marie Laveau, who was attempting to resurrect Varnae. It appeared that King and Drake had somehow been merged into Dracula when he was resurrected, but the two had since been freed. Deacon captured Blade, Hannibal King, and Brother Voodoo to establish his rep among the undead in a power grab. The heroes freed themselves from the trap and Blade battled Deacon Frost to a stalemate. Deacon escaped and Blade vowed again to hunt him down.{{r|Blade Vol 1 1}}

===Sins of the Father===
The daughter of a vampire mafia Don manipulated Blade into attacking her father's estate with a story about seeking vengeance for being turned into one of the undead, but she and her husband really just want to eliminate the Daywalker and remove her father in a power grab. After she and her husband killed her father, Blade slayed the two of them.{{r|Blade: Sins of the Father #1}}

===Daywalker===
In New Orleans, Blade teamed with Brother Voodoo to stop Marie Laveau and Deacon Frost's plans to build an undead army. Later, Blade and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] encountered the vampire [[Henry Sage (Earth-616)|Henry Sage]] and learned of the development of the Daywalker formula, a version of the Sunlight Serum.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 2 7}} Blade helped Spider-Man try to capture their former ally Morbius, who was under the control of a vampire known as the [[Loxias Crown (Earth-616)|Hunger]]. During the battle, Morbius bit Blade, but his blood enzymes were not enough to protect him from Morbius' unique form of vampirism. This transformed Blade into a Daywalker: a vampire able to move about in the sunlight and lacking most of the vampire's traditional weaknesses. Blade was now driven by bloodthirst, however, but he was able to hold it back with a serum.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 8}}
Back in New Orleans, he was contacted by [[Dominique Levant (Earth-616)|Dominique Levant]]{{r|Blade Vol 2 1}} who led him into the midst of a vampiric coup which involved Morbius and the powerful [[Ulysses Sojourner (Earth-616)|Ulysses Sojourner]].{{r|Blade Vol 2 2}} Sojourner sought to unify all vampires on the East Coast, but Blade was able to stop his plans.{{r|Blade Vol 2 3}}

===Silvereye===
Blade was also temporarily in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody due to the machinations of [[Silvereye (Earth-616)|Silvereye]] as they sought to use him. Their plans for Blade failed. However, [[Darius Venginian (Earth-616)|Darius Venginian]]'s true agenda remains unknown.{{r|Blade: Vampire Hunter #1|6}}

===Battling the Tryks===
Blade encountered a new type of vampiric creature called a [[Tryks|Tryk]], which was fearless of vampires and hunted them.{{r|Blade Vol 3 1}} The queen of the Tryks was interested in a ceremony which would make Blade her king and an organization called the [[Seven (Earth-616)|The Seven]] was introduced which pursued a policy of 'vampiric equilibrium'. They killed both vampires and the Tryks which prey upon them, but only enough to regulate the numbers of both types. They were upset with Blade's recent escalation of vampire killings, as they didn't want an all-out war spilling over into the streets, so they authorized assassinating him.{{r|Blade Vol 3 2}} The Seven revealed that the [[Cilla (Earth-616)|Queen Cilla]] of the Tryks wanted Blade for her mate so that she could devour him and produce another queen. Blade went on a date with his new girlfriend Susan and told her that the vampires tricked him into slaying his former lover with a sword by drugging her and outfitting her with contact lenses and fake fangs. The vampires captured Fofo, Blade's weapons supplier, and placed a tracking device on him so that he would lead them to Blade after they dump him in the river. The vampires got the drop on Blade and captured him.{{r|Blade Vol 3 3}}

The Tryk captures the Seven agents who were sent to kill Blade while Blade escapes from the vampires. The Tryk brings the agents to his queen after Blade receives some I.D. from them which he traces back to their leader. The boy (since leaders of the Seven age backward) makes Blade the offer of a sword to invade the queen's stronghold and slay them so he can submerge himself in the queen's baths and become fully human.{{r|Blade Vol 3 4}}After Blade has sex with Susan, he finds out that she has been the Tryk queen in disguise all along. Blade enters the queen's baths but does not change, so he realizes the leader of the Seven was manipulating him. Blade then destroys the Tryk lair, but the now-pregnant queen escapes. Realizing the Tryk numbers have been so thinned by Blade, the Seven countermands its previous directive to assassinate Blade and let him have a free hand in the field.{{r|Blade Vol 3 5}} Blade later helps a woman put to rest her husband who was killed by a vampire being pursued by Blade.{{r|Blade Vol 3 6}}

===Meeting the Punisher===
Blade found the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] hiding on a rooftop he was viewing a deal between vampires and some thugs. The Punisher emerged from the shadows the two drew their weapons, Blade eventually lowered his and told the Punisher, that if he shot him, the vampires below would know. Then the Punisher attached a silencer to his gun and shot Blade in the back, Blade remains unharmed and they argued. They turn their attention to the crime below. Blade admitted that he admired the Punisher but suddenly there was an explosion a few blocks away, the vampires think it is the thugs and try to eat them, but Blade and Punisher jumped from the roof to kill them all.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 3 8}}

===Lucas Cross===
[[File:Blade Vol 4 11 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
Blade came into contact with Dracula again, and appeared to fully destroy the vampire once again, aboard the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier|S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Pericles V]].{{r|Blade Vol 4 1}} After taking on a time travel mission for [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], Blade received from Doom an elixir that would purportedly cure him of his thirst for human blood but would also remove the bloodlust he had killing the undead. During the mission in the past, Blade fulfilled part of a prophecy by freeing his imprisoned father.{{r|Blade Vol 4 2}}

Unknown to Blade, his wealthy father, [[Lucas Cross (Earth-616)|Lucas Cross]], was responsible for Dracula's resurrection. Lucas kidnapped his son and tried to force Blade to feed on a young virgin girl by starving him; in an attempt to fulfill the same prophecy that Blade had unwittingly begun. Blade escaped with the girl unharmed after biting through his own hand.{{r|Blade Vol 4 6}}

Blade returned home to [[England]] seeking answers about his past and the prophecy. Shortly after arriving he used his S.H.I.E.L.D. connections to learn of vampires running illegal weaponry, and killed them while procuring the guns he was unable to bring into the country. The deaths of these vampires altered a powerful vampire priest, [[Draconis (Earth-616)|Draconis]], to Blades presence. Draconis attacked Blade and was able to defeat him as he had spent decades building up an immunity to vampiric weaknesses including being staked in the heart, specifically to defeat Blade in vengeance for his time spent in London killing vampires when he was young.{{r|Blade Vol 4 7}} Blade survived this encounter thanks to a talisman which made vampires immortal and was aware he couldn't take Draconis on alone, after gathering information on him, and called [[Hannibal King (Earth-616)|Hannibal King]] for help in taking him down. Blade fed upon Draconis to make killing him easter, thus feeding on virgin blood and unknowingly fulfilling the prophecy.{{r|Blade Vol 4 8}} 

While still in England, Blade dug up his mother's grave and within her casket marked '[[Vanessa Brooks (Earth-616)|Tara Cross]]' he found a confession she wrote about having been married to Lucas Cross as well as being a member of the [[Order of Tyrana (Earth-616)|Order of Tyrana]] from whom she had been forced to flee. From [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] he learned that the Order were connected to the [[Knights of Pendragon (Earth-616)|Knights of Pendragon]] of which he learns [[Joseph Chapman (Earth-616)|Joseph Chapman]], the current [[Union Jack]], is a member as well as a vampire hunter. Chapman was already on Blade's trail and attempted to kill Hannibal for being a vampire. After getting Chapman to spot attacking them and speak with them instead, Blade learned more about the Order, including the fact that they were supposedly good people.{{r|Blade Vol 4 9}}

Blade returned to America and tracked his father down to a social club party in [[Washington, D.C.]] to get answers. Blade learned his father was a vampire and that everything he had been doing was in service to the prophecy. Blade had distracted his father long enough for Hannibal to obtain a copy of the prophecy, the details of which Blade recognised in his recent actions, including the freeing of his father from a [[Latveria|Latverian]] prison. Blade began working on stopping the prophecy which led him to try and track down Dracula's body, to aid in this he approached [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] in [[New York City]] (whose [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|uncle]] and [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|aunt]] he was unaware he had once saved from a vampire attack shortly after their marriage). Blade learned more about how Spider-Man was temporarily turned into a vampire, including the fact that [[Jamal Afari (Earth-616)|Jamal Afari]], an old friend and mentor of Blade's who he was forced to kill, had been the vampire to turn him.{{r|Blade Vol 4 10}}

Blade spent weeks searching the planet for Jamal but was unable to find him, until his father broke into his home to offer his help. Blade travelled alongside his father and Hannibal to [[Transylvania]] where his father assured him they would find Jamal at [[Castle Dracula]] according to the prophecy which he believed would give all vampires back their souls. Blade wasn't interested in potentially making vampires invulnerable by returning their souls and refused, at which point his father revealed he had been holding Jamal and would stake him dead if Blade did not cooperate. Desperately wanting the return of his soul, Hannibal turned against Blade who quickly killed him.{{r|Blade Vol 4 11}}

Moments after killing friend, Blade was confronted by Dracula who Lucas had returned to life and brokered a deal with. Dracula tried to force Blade to complete the prophecy by returning a piece of the stake used to kill him to the ground of his Castle but Blade refused, causing Dracula to target Jamal in an attempt to convince him. In the ensuing scuffle the sliver of stake touched the ground as Blade fumbled it, enacting the prophecy though not in the way Lucas Cross had expected. The prophecy did not return vampires lost souls to them but instead brought every dead vampire back to undead life including Hannibal. Blade then decided not to kill his father and instead left him to live with his actions. Later, in exchange for having killed him, Blade gave Hannibal the potion he obtained from Doctor Doom so Hannibal could live without bloodlust.{{r|Blade Vol 4 12}}

===Vanguard===
[[File:Vanguard (Black Ops) (Earth-616) from Marvel Comics Presents Vol 2 7 0001.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]
Blade was recruited into the [[Vanguard (Black Ops) (Earth-616)|Vanguard]], the name of a secret black-ops team of superheroes that carried out missions, including assassinations, on foreign soil. During one mission, [[Scott Wright (Earth-616)|Micromax]] was captured by [[Jaafar Yoosuf (Earth-616)|Jaafar Yoosuf]] and was forced to tell him about Vanguard and their most powerful operative, [[Trenton Craft (Earth-616)|Colonel America (Trenton Craft)]].

Blade believed that the only solution was to put her out of her misery. Wolverine warned him not to, prompting the vampire hunter to leave.{{r|X-Men Vol 3 6}}

===Mighty Avengers===
Blade secretly arrived at [[New York City]] in order to ask his associate [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Spectrum]] for help on a mission. However, they were interrupted by the invasion of [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos']] army on Earth. Monica convinced Blade to help, but since he wanted to stay under the radar, he wore a faux-Spider-Man suit from a superhero costume shop. As "Spider Hero," Blade became part of the team of heroes now named the [[Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]], named after a Twitter hashtag used to describe them.{{r|{{cl|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 1}}-[[Mighty Avengers Vol 2 3|3]]}}

[[File:Mighty Avengers Vol 2 4.INH Textless.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Ronin and Spider Hero]]

Following the victory of Earth's heroes over Thanos' army, Eric adopted [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye's]] former identity of Ronin.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 4.INH}} As Ronin, Blade accompanied his teammates to [[Attilan]].

[[File:Eric Brooks (Earth-616) from Mighty Avengers Vol 2 9 001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Ronin exposed]]

Even though he escaped captivity after being drained a portion of his blood, and the [[Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]] located him, Blade couldn't prevent the Deathwalkers from finishing their ritual. The successfully-finished ceremony merged them together into the [[Deathwalker Prime (Earth-616)|Deathwalker Prime]], a creature with control over the four elements, thus power over the fifth: the spirit, which would be the key for it to destroy humankind.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 13}}

However, the Mighty Avengers managed to get hold of the cup used in the ritual of merging, and using a similar procedure merged themselves into the [[Avenger Prime (Earth-616)|Avenger Prime]], which managed to destroy the Deathwalker Prime, mainly because unlike the Deathwalker, the different personas merged into it were truly spiritually bonded, while the personas composing the Deathwalker were fighting for control.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 14}}

===Avengers===
Blade was captured by vampires and eventually freed by [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 12}} On the advice of the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]], Blade joined the Avengers and aided them stem a civil war between the vampire community being waged by [[Xarus (Earth-616)|Shadow Colonel]] and the [[Legion of the Unliving (Vampires) (Earth-616)|Legion of the Unliving]], which turned out to be a ploy by Dracula to renew the [[Vampire Nation (Earth-616)|Vampire Nation]] by removing weaker elements from it.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 14|17}}

Blade chose to leave the Avengers and live in the Vampire Nation to keep the vampires in check with the full authority of the Avengers and the United Nations.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 45}}

===[[Heroes Reborn (2021 Event)|Heroes Reborn]]===
One day, Blade woke up to discover that the entire world had changed to [[Earth-TRN852|one]] where the Avengers didn't exist and the [[Squadron Supreme of America (Earth-TRN852)|Squadron Supreme]] was the world's premiere superhero team. Wanting to change the world back to its proper state, Blade sought to create the Avengers.

With the help of a [[Wakanda|Wakandan]] spaceship, Brandy Selby was discovered deep in space and was returned to Earth. The Squadron Supreme eventually caught wind of the Avengers and began investigating them. When the Squadron found the Avengers in the hidden nation of Wakanda, Blade and the Avengers were ready to fight the Squadron.{{r|Heroes Reborn Vol 2 4|7}}

Blade and the other Avengers were about to fight Nighthawk when reality was returned to normal when the source of the reality warp was destroyed, [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-TRN852)|President Coulson]]'s [[Pandemonium Cube]]. Blade was returned to Earth-616 and woke up to find himself back in Chernobyl. Blade surmised that his supernatural nature was what protected him from the reality warp.{{r|Heroes Return Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = '''Dhampir Physiology:''' Blade was born a human/[[Vampires|vampire]] hybrid, the enzymes in Blade's blood made him immune to normal vampire bites, uniquely attuned to sensing the supernatural and resistant to aging. Since being bitten by [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]], Blade has gained many of the traditional powers of the vampire without developing their weaknesses. He has superhuman strength, senses, and stamina, plus an accelerated healing factor.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 2}}
*'''Superhumanly Acute Senses:''' Blade's sense of sight and hearing are heightened to levels comparable to those possessed by true vampires. He is capable of seeing objects with perfect clarity at much greater distances than ordinary humans. He retains this same level of clarity even in near-total darkness. His hearing is similarly enhanced, allowing him to detect sounds that an ordinary human can't hear and enable him to hear sounds an ordinary human can hear but at greater distances. Blade is also able to sense the presence of supernatural beings or forces whereas an ordinary human would be oblivious to them.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 2}}
**'''Superhuman Sense of Smell:''' Blade possesses an incredibly pronounced sense of smell, easily able to discern what's human and what's not even from a good distance away.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 35}} Jen Walters likened his olfactory senses to that of Wolverine.
*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Blade possesses the strength of a vampire, allowing him to lift about 1 ton due to his half-vampire side. Blade has overpowered a vampiric Spider-Man, routinely makes prodigious jumps of hundreds of feet through the air, and has sufficient strength to easily rip the head off of another vampire with his bare hands.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 2}}
*'''Superhuman Speed:''' Blade is capable of running and moving at speeds greater than even the finest human athlete. He can also accelerate his movements to cover short distances in an instant, faster than the human eye can see, but he is not as fast as a pure vampire. His reflexes are similarly heightened. He moves so fast that everything else when compared to him, appears to be moving in slow motion. 
[[File:Eric Brooks (Earth-616) from Deadpool Vol 6 28 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
*'''Superhuman Agility:''' Blade's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete. He can leap several feet into the air and is able to move, jump, climb, flip, and run at incredibly fast speeds without difficulty or exhaustion. He can perform above-human parkour feats and virtually always land on his feet.
**'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Blade's musculature generates less lactic acid (i.e. muscle fatigue) during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. He can exert himself at peak capacity for several hours before fatigue begins to impair him.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 2}}
*'''Superhuman Durability:''' Blade's Vampire/Human Hybrid tissue allows him to sustain physical trauma to a certain extent. He can withstand powerful energy blasts, exposure to temperature extremes, and great impact forces without being injured. He's been seen tanking a blast from Lilith herself and walked away with minor burns and injuries. This also contributes to his healing factor, making him more resistant than a normal human.
*'''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Blade, like true vampires, possesses an accelerated healing ability that allows him to heal mild to moderate injuries with much greater speed and efficiency than ordinary humans.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 2}} He is capable of healing from severe slashes and puncture wounds within a matter of minutes to hours depending on the severity of the wound. Wolverine himself stated that his regeneration was almost on par with his during his fight with Blade in the Civil War. However, he is not able to regenerate missing limbs or organs.
*'''Contaminant Transferal:''' Eric can take any kind of ingestible or even metaphysical ailments coursing in the system of another living being, or willingly introduced into his system and pass it along in the same way Vampire transfer their mitochondria pathogen that turns others into their thralls.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 16}} Having used such a factor of his vamp-lite body to drain away the taint which remade Robbie Reyes into a more monstrous form of ghost rider, as well as used it to deliver a cure King T'Challa developed which nullifies the Roxxon B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R shocktrooper's hulk like transformation abilities.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 20}}
*'''Prolonged Lifespan:''' Although not a pure vampire, he does have the advantage of being a Hybrid. This includes a Pseudo-Immortality, greatly enhanced lifespan. This has also been noted in the Superhuman Registration act as one of his abilities. Also, no change of his appearance has been seen during his time on earth. Besides losing his hair sometimes.{{citation}}
*'''Immunity To Vampire Vulnerabilities:''' True vampires have numerous and very particular supernatural vulnerabilities, most of which Blade is totally immune to. For instance, Blade is unaffected by direct exposure to sunlight, whereas most vampires are either rendered comatose during the daylight hours or are quickly incinerated when exposed directly to sunlight. Vampires are also highly allergic to silver, supposedly because of the metal's mystical purity. As a result, silver blades or bullets are capable of killing vampires. If not killed, and merely injured, it will take a vampire much longer to heal than if the injury had been inflicted by another material. Blade himself could be injured by a silver weapon, much as an ordinary human would, but his healing powers would be able to heal it as if it were an ordinary wound. Blade is also immune to the effects of religious icons, such as crucifixes, whereas vampires are rendered almost powerless when confronted by them.
*'''Transformation:''' Blade seemingly possesses the ability to change to & from human form to a more monstrous state of being by force of will.{{r|Heroes Reborn Vol 2 2}}
**'''Wing Manifestation:''' Blades transformed state comes with the added proclivity of bat like aviary appendages that enable him to fly around at high speed. Picking up Steve Rogers in a flash before Hyperion could react in time to catch him.{{r|Heroes Reborn Vol 2 2}}

*'''Intimidation:''' Blade is well-known and feared among vampires and other supernatural beings who are hesitant about ever facing him in combat or invoking his wrath.

| Strength                = Blade was born a [[Dhampir]]. This altered his skeletal and cardiac muscle system on a cellular level. His skeletal muscles are more dense, more efficient and faster, allowing him to produce short and fast bursts of excessive force. Although this requires a lot of stamina, his cardiac muscle system has changed as well accordingly. The cardiac muscle system provides the skeletal muscle enough nutrition to allow his body to perform for several hours of maximum combat before fatigue begins to impair him. His hardened and thickened skeletal system support his superhuman strength somewhat contributing to his enhanced durability. He possesses the strength sufficient to lift about 1 ton.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 2}}{{citation}}

| Weaknesses              = 
* Blade does possess one weakness common to all vampires: the need to ingest fresh blood in order to stay alive. However, rather than consume blood, he ingests or injects a specially designed serum that provides even better nourishment that blood would provide. If Blade doesn't drink the serum for an extended period of time, he will weaken and his self-control will be stretched. He would be forced to attack a human and consume his or her blood if this period is more than a week. Blade does have a huge amount of blood-serum in his inventory and actually never runs out of energy. One serum is enough for 24 hours of extended combat or he can use it to quickly recover from grave wounds. Although he has a special meditation to maintain his self-control An extended period of time without consuming either blood or the serum will prove fatal.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Marvel Knights 2005 Vol 1 1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 2}}
* '''Vulnerability to Red Sunlight:''' While not affected by normal (yellow) sunlight and immune to all the weaknesses of traditional vampires, Blade has been shown to be vulnerable to red sunlight which is able to burn his skin. Longer exposure to red sunlight can be fatal.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 27}}

* '''[[Blade's Sword]]'''

| Notes                   = * It was implied that the identity of Ronin / Spider Hero was that of Blade before it was even revealed, because of three notable hints: his interest in vampires (or as he calls them, "walkers"), his cloak that he wears which is the same as his old one, and the fact that blades are always present around him when he appears somewhere.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 4.INH}}
