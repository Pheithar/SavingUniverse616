===Senator Kelly===
He later ran for office and became a Senator for his home state of Massachusetts.

===[[Days of Future Past]]===
To cope with this supposed danger, he promoted legislation such as the [[Mutant Registration Act]], requiring those with powers of genetic origin to disclose their abilities to the government.
