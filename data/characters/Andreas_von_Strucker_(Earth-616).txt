===Thunderbolts===
[[File:Andreas von Strucker (Earth-616) from Thunderbolts Vol 1 110 cover.jpg|left|thumb|"Swordsman"]]
Baron Zemo employed [[Zebediah Killgrave (Earth-616)|Zebediah Killgrave]], the Purple Man, to train Andreas as the new [[Swordsman]]. While receiving his training from Killgrave, Andreas was given a leather strap made from his sister's skin which he used as the grip on his sword to harness his powers.

===Secret Invasion===
When [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] was made leader of the new Thunderbolts, he attempted to give the team a new image in the public eye as a legitimate hero organization despite having an all-villain lineup. While active on this squad, Andreas was seemingly re-united with his deceased sister Andrea, who claimed to have been resurrected by [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]]'s cloning process. The two began a physical relationship while Osborn became suspicious of how quickly Zola was able to create her.
