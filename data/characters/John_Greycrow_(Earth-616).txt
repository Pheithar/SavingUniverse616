===Early Life===
John Greycrow was a Native American from an unidentified tribe{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #1}} who was taught to use firearms from an early age by his father.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 13}} He fought in [[World War II]] for the [[United States of America]], but was executed for murdering his fellow officers. He was shot by a firing squad and was believed killed. However, because of his regenerative powers he survived and became a mercenary.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 #14}} Decades later, he worked at a diner in Millstone, [[Arizona (State)|Arizona]] with [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Remy LeBeau]] and Claire DeLuc.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #324}} LeBeau later recruited him to join the Marauders on behalf of [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Sinister]].

[[File:John Greycrow (Earth-616) from Gambit Vol 3 9 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]
===Marauders===
Greycrow became a member of the Marauders, a band of assassins who were gathered together by the mutant thief [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] at the request of the enigmatic mastermind known as [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]].

===First mission: Kill [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]]===
For their first mission,{{r|X-Men: Messiah Complex - Mutant Files #1}} the Marauders were tasked with the assassination of Sinister's former pawn [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]]. Sinister had formerly erased any proof of her existence.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #221}}

Along with [[Philippa Sontag (Earth-616)|Arclight]], Greycrow posed as a paramedic while Madelyn was the sole survivor of a plane crash in [[San Francisco]]. She tried to escape but was hunted by Greycrow, Arclight,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #215}} [[Prism (Robbie) (Earth-616)|Prism]], and [[Kodiak Noatak (Earth-616)|Harpoon]],<ref>{{cl|X-Factor Vol 1 38}}: Flashback shows [[Prism (Robbie) (Earth-616)|Prism]] and [[Kodiak Noatak (Earth-616)|Harpoon]] along with Greycrow, while {{cl|Uncanny X-Men #215}} shows only Arclight with him</ref> and was eventually shot by Greycrow and left for dead,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #215}} only for her to recover in a hospital.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #206}}

===[[Mutant Massacre]]===
Sinister next sent the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] to murder the entire population of the underground [[Homo superior|mutant]] community known as the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]].<ref>Greycrow's [[Mutant Massacre]]: {{cl|Uncanny X-Men #210|#211}}; {{cl|X-Factor #10}}; {{cl|Power Pack #27}}; {{cl|X-Factor #11}}; {{cl|Uncanny X-Men #213}}</ref>

In [[Los Angeles]], the Marauders led by Greycrow attacked the Morlock [[Tommy (Morlock) (Earth-616)|Tommy]], killing her friend and [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] agent [[Richard Salmons (Earth-616)|Richard Salmons]], and letting her escape, only for her to involuntarily lead them to the [[Alley]], the Morlocks' secret home in the tunnels beneath [[New York City]]. After finding the Alley, Greycrow shot Tommy, and the Marauders entered the tunnels.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #210}}

Over the course of this mutant massacre, Greycrow killed countless Morlocks, including [[Annalee (Earth-616)|Annalee]] and her babies.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #211}}{{r|Power Pack #27}} He also clashed with the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]{{r|Uncanny X-Men #211}} and [[Power Pack (Earth-616)|Power Pack]].<ref>{{cl|X-Factor #11}} (flashback); Not seen in {{cl|Power Pack #27}}</ref> 

===Targeting [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] allies===
He was also tasked with the assassination of [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] alongside Arclight and [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]]. Destroying her house and tracking her, they were unsuccessful in eliminating Polaris, as she was already possessed by [[Alice MacAllister (Earth-616)|Malice]] who used the magnetic powers of her host to defeat the three Marauders. Taking the leadership of the team from Greycrow as Sinister intended, she also revealed that the mission was only a test of her power.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #219}}

Later, the Marauders were chastised by Sinister, as Madelyne Pryor wasn't dead, and he threatened to kill one of the Marauders if the mission wasn't accomplished. The Marauders consequently assaulted the [[San Francisco Memorial Hospital]], and Greycrow headed to Madelyne's room where he killed a nurse but was stopped in his execution by [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]]. Pryor used that opportunity to fight back, long enough for [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]] to hit him with a blast thanks to [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]]'s telepathic monitoring.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #221}}

Following that brawl, both X-Men and Marauders scattered across town. Greycrow took position on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], intending to shoot down Rogue, but was stopped by [[Longshot (Mojoverse)|Longshot]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]. He was quickly backed up by [[Kim Il Sung (Earth-616)|Scrambler]] and Sabretooth, and the two X-Men fell from the Bridge.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #222}} The Marauders then retreated from the city.

===[[Inferno (Event)|Inferno]]===
Later, the Marauders relocated their base to the Morlocks' tunnels, and Greycrow and Sabretooth were sent to scout for intruders, only to be both defeated by Dazzler.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #240}} The Marauders escaped from the sewers, only for the battle to continue in the streets, right in the middle of the "[[Inferno (Event)|Inferno]]" demonic invasion of [[New York City]]. Both mutant teams were also attacked by [[Demons]] and the armored soldiers of the [[Right (Earth-616)|Right]]. Greycrow himself targeted Rogue who took revenge on him for their San Francisco encounter.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #241}} All of the Marauders were killed during the invasion.

===Fighting [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]]===
Clones of the Marauders later clashed with the dimensionally-displaced young mutant known as [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]] after they attempted to assassinate Sinister's former servant, [[Melody Jacobs (Earth-616)|Threnody]]. Greycrow's clone was killed in this conflict, as X-Man telekinetically pulled the trigger of his gun, killing [[Prism (Robbie) (Earth-616)|Prism]] and wounding [[Janos Quested (Earth-616)|Riptide]], before being killed by the explosion of his ammunitions, again caused by X-Man.{{r|X-Man #13}}

===Post M-Day===
Greycrow was one of the still-powered mutants living in tents on the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] lawn after almost all mutants were depowered on [[Decimation|M-Day]].{{r|X-Men: The 198 Vol 1 5}} However, when [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] came seeking people for his cause, Greycrow chose to serve him. When [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] warned him, along with [[Fever Pitch (Earth-616)|Fever Pitch]] and [[Sally Blevins (Earth-616)|Skids]], that they were in way over their heads, Greycrow replied that Apocalypse had explained it all to them and was on their side.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 184}} Also during his time as a member of the [[198 (Earth-616)|198]], he became romantically involved with his Marauders compatriot, Arclight.

He left the institute at the request of Sinister and re-joined the Marauders and fought the X-Men to lay claim to the Mutant Messiah, [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 200}} In the aftermath of [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]], Greycrow was scared of the X-Men and ran away from the Marauders. He was located by [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], who apparently converted him to Christianity.{{r|X-Men Divided We Stand #1}}

He later joined the X-Men on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] after being brought in by [[Weapon Plus]] to deliver new versions of [[Predator X]] to attack the X-Men. He was granted sanctuary after warning the X-Men and helping them slay the beasts.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #515|517}} Greycrow fought alongside the X-Men during [[Second Coming]]{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 #14}} and was also a part of the [[Age of X]], an alteration of reality by the mad mutant [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]].

Later, Greycrow was tracked down by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], who seemingly severed his arms and legs leaving him crippled.{{r|Magneto Vol 3 6}}

He later returned with his limbs restored and became a pawn of Magneto along with the other Marauders to be used by Magneto for his own uses.{{r|Magneto Vol 3 15}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Greycrow and the Marauders struck off on their own, once again massacring the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlock]] population. This led an angered [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]], their new leader, to rejoin the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. When the X-Men re-encountered the Morlocks, the Marauders fought briefly, but ultimately surrendered, professing their innocence. Not believing them, Chamber burned them to death with his psionic flame.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 18}}

===[[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] & [[Hellions (Essex) (Earth-616)|The Hellions]]===
Greycrow later appeared revived, presumably resurrected by the [[Five (Earth-616)|Five]], and accepted Xavier's invitation to all mutants to join the nation of Krakoa. Being the only Marauder to join the island, however, he quickly fell into trouble after engaging in a shootout with multiple Morlocks, who sought revenge on him for his actions in the Mutant Massacre on the anniversary of the event. As punishment, Greycrow was placed on a new iteration of the [[Hellions (Essex) (Earth-616)|Hellions]] led by Mister Sinister, as a chance for rehabilitation, with their first job to capture Greycrow's ex-teammates in the Marauders who refused to come to the island. Greycrow took the job of handling a feral [[Kyle Gibney (Earth-616)|Wild Child]] on missions.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 1}}

During their first mission, he was captured along with [[Nanny (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Nanny]] and [[Orphan-Maker (Peter) (Earth-616)|Orphan-Maker]] while the others were off battling the rest of the Marauders and Goblyn Queen. While being cut open by a decaying, perverse Arclight, he was saved by his teammates Wild Child and [[Kwannon (Earth-616)|Psylocke]], and [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], who blew up the house, defeated the rest of the Marauders.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 2|4}}

John, after the mission, was seen enjoying himself at the Krakoan shore and was visited by Wild Child and Psylocke.
