| History                 = Abraxas presumably came into existence when the [[First Firmament (First Cosmos)|original universe]] that eventually branched out into the [[multiverse]] was formed, spontaneously assuming the embodiment of destruction that was the counterpart to the very act of creation embodied by the being known as [[Eternity (Multiverse)|Eternity]]. Abraxas grew within the core of Eternity, although into each reality Eternity made certain a being existed to keep Abraxas from emerging. This being would later be known as the planet devouring [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 #48}}

When the Galactus of the [[Earth-616|prime reality]] died,{{r|Galactus the Devourer #6}} Abraxas emerged. Abraxas soon began to cut a swath of terror through various alternate realities, including the murder of other versions of [[Galactus]]. Abraxas used the head of a Galactus to target and home in on the prime reality's [[Earth]] and to plant a mole in the form of an [[Frankie Raye (Earth-1462)|alternate universe version]] of the dead [[Heralds of Galactus (Earth-616)|Herald]] [[Frankie Raye (Earth-616)|Nova]]. On Earth, Abraxas attacked [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu the Watcher]] and stole half of his signature medallion.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #2001}}

Abraxas taunted the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] with the inevitability of his arrival, enticing the team to search for the [[Ultimate Nullifier]], the clues to the location of which were scattered among alternate realities. Ultimately, the Four found the Ultimate Nullifier when Abraxas suddenly appeared and stole it from them. Abraxas called forth an army of [[Frankie Raye|Novas]] to attack Earth and the Fantastic Four held no hope of defeating him. Instead, [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]], the son of the Four members [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]], combined his cosmic powers with those of his sister, [[Valeria von Doom (Earth-99315)|Valeria]], to reconstitute Galactus and thus restored balance to Eternity, at the cost of burning out his own powers. Galactus took the Ultimate Nullifier from Abraxas, giving it to Mister Fantastic who used the weapon, destroying himself and Abraxas. The result served to recreate a reality in which Abraxas never existed, and since all that was had ended, all that is was realigned, allowing Mister Fantastic to survive along with all those who died in Abraxas' reign of terror.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 #46|49}}

| Powers                  = As antithesis to the cosmic entity [[Eternity (Multiverse)|Eternity]], Abraxas is a powerful intelligence representing the embodiment of the destruction of the multiverse, and as such is far removed from the limits of human understanding. Presumably, Abraxas' humanoid form is a manifestation used to communicate, or is merely the perception of the individual witnessing his presence. His powers are limitless, and he can manipulate the fabric of reality to accomplish his ends. It is likely that only the [[Living Tribunal (Multiverse)|Living Tribunal]] and the [[One-Above-All (Multiverse)|One Above All]] can single-handedly overpower him.
