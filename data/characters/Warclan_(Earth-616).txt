| HistoryText             = Domina and her Warclan emerged attacking both [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Sinister]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. [[Domina (Earth-616)|Domina]] and [[Jaeger (Earth-616)|Jaeger]]'s daughter was one of the Neo killed due to loss of powers.

Jaeger was killed by [[Cecilia Reyes (Earth-616)|Cecilia Reyes]]. Interesting enoughly, some members seemed to think that [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]] was possibly a Neo. The clan eventually came to terms with the X-Men.

The returning [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto (Magnus)]] soon appeared wishing them to join him as part of his assembled forces on Genosha. [[Rax (Earth-616)|Rax]] and [[Salvo (Neo) (Earth-616)|Salvo]] attacked only to be ripped apart. Domina surrendered her clan.

Recently, the team returned, facing the [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]] team.

They were terminated with their entire kind, wiped out by [[Evolutionaries]] when the [[Guardian Clan (Earth-616)|Guardian Clan]] attacked [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]]
