===Reavers===
Nothing is known about the indigenous Australian identified only as Gateway prior to his forced servitude with the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]], a band of criminal cyborgs using his teleportation abilities to travel to remote locations to loot and pillage. The Reavers held him hostage by threatening to irretrievably destroy one of his people's sacred places, forcing his ancestral spirits to become demonically enslaved and walk forever lost in other-dimensional "Dreamtime".

His true name apparently known only to himself, it was the Reavers who bestowed the moniker "Gateway", treating the man more as a utility, spending virtually every moment sitting atop a rock near their Outback base of operations. Tracking the Reavers from a [[Hong Kong]] raid, the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] defeated them in battle. The Reaver [[Skullbuster (Earth-616)|Skullbuster]] told Gateway he would be released from all obligations to the cyborgs if Gateway would use his powers to liberate them one last time. Agreeing, Skullbuster and two others made good their escape.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #229}}

Having run off the Reavers, the then-transitory [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] took over their abandoned Outback town headquarters. Gateway began volunteering his abilities to facilitate the X-Men's travels, the telepathic [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] using her powers to directly communicate to him where they wanted to go. In many ways, Gateway became an unofficial member of the team during this time, yet remained a constant mystery.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #244}}

At one point, he brought the young mutant named [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]] to the X-Men's base after she followed the women of the team home from a California shopping spree. Gateway seemingly did so deliberately, and even verbally greeted Jubilation, but his reasoning is unknown.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 12}} Shortly after, the escaping Reavers returned, their numbers bolstered by the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club's]] [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]], [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]], and her own cybernetic henchmen: [[Angelo Macon (Earth-616)|Macon]], [[Wade Cole (Earth-616)|Cole]], and [[Murray Reese (Earth-616)|Reese]]. This reinforced lineup managed to the chase off the temporarily outnumbered X-Men, reclaiming their town and severing the heroes' relationship with Gateway.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #251}} Gateway was forced into serving the Reavers again, until a cadre of Sentinels wiped out the cyborgs.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #281}}

===[[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]]===
Some time later, Gateway appeared at the campus of the new [[Massachusetts Academy]] branch of [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Professor Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], wherein members of the young mutant team, [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]], received training in the use of their powers. Here, Gateway continued his mysterious meditations, though breaking his long silence at one point to utter the name of [[Hollow (Earth-616)|Penance]], a young mutant he had brought to the school. Gateway's presence at the school was evidently motivated by the redemption of guilt for playing a role in the destruction of another group of mutant students, the [[Hellions (Earth-616)|Hellions]]. It was also revealed that Gateway was a one-time mentor to the young mutant [[Claudette and Nicole St. Croix (Earth-616)|St. Croix Twins]], Claudette and Nicolette, when they were merged together to impersonate their older sister, [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]].{{r|Generation X #2|5}}

===[[X-Men (X-Treme) (Earth-616)|X-Treme X-Men]]===
Eventually, Gateway teleported away from the Academy, deciding his time with Generation X over. He later appeared to the renegade [[X-Men (X-Treme) (Earth-616)|X-Treme X-Men]] team after the apparent death of Psylocke, revealing to the X-Man [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] that he was his great-grandfather.{{r|X-Treme X-Men #4}}

===[[Endangered Species]]===
Gateway returned to Australia, resuming his life as a hermit. He was attacked and apparently killed by the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] for his knowledge of [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny's]] [[Destiny's Books|Diaries]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #202}}

===[[Secret Warriors (Earth-616)|Secret Warriors]] & [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]]===
He, however, reappeared, taking care of [[Eden Fesi (Earth-616)|Eden Fesi]], a teleporter. He was visited there by [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] who wanted to recruit him into his [[Secret Warriors (Earth-616)|Secret Warriors]], but refused to let his disciple go with him, and later made him join them when [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Quake]] and [[Sebastian Druid (Earth-616)|Druid]] came.{{r|Secret Warriors #4}}

[[File:Gateway (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 27.png|left|thumb|175px|Gateway is killed by Ultimaton]]

He was once more used by the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]] who were intending to blow up [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], and threatened to terminate his family and village if he refused to cooperate. He managed to call [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] via [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #5.1}}

He later opened a portal to return the [[X-Men (Earth-295)|X-Men]] of [[Earth-295]] to their world. Gateway would stay with X-Force until he was apparently destined to die again, this time by the hand of [[Ultimaton (Earth-616)|Ultimaton]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #27}} [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] managed to use Gateway's last breath to teleport them to a random location, which appeared to be a [[Earth-12928|possible future]]. His corpse was probably disintegrated in the explosion.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #29}}

===Dawn of X===
Gateway was later seen alive and well presumably resurrected in [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] by the [[Five (Earth-616)|Five]]. He was shown helping teleport Captain Kate Pryde and her [[Marauders (Pryde) (Earth-616)|Marauders]] from [[Taipei]] to [[London (England)|London]].{{r|Marauders Vol 1 2}} 

| Powers                  = '''Trans-Dimensional Gateways''': Gateway is in tune with the spiritual force of his people that allows him to create teleportation "gateways" from one location to another. Gateway creates these warp tunnels, which can traverse both time and space, by whirling his bullroarer over his head. Gateway somehow causes a burning fire to appear before him when he creates one of his gateways, though the role that the fire and the bullroarer play in the creation and functioning of the gateways is unclear. The gateways can be used for both observation and transport. The exact limits of how much mass can be transported is yet to be revealed.

There are no known limits to Gateway's teleportation range. He has, for example, transported the X-Men from Australia to the United States and back using his powers, as well as transporting them trans-dimensionally to another Earth. He also opened up gateways that observe past events, such as the one that allowed the feral X-Man [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and the ninja named [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]] to learn the truth behind the powerful psionic being known as [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]]. 

*'''''Trans-Realm Clairvoyance''''': This power enables him to view other times, dimensions, and physical planes. He is virtually omniscient, as he is described as "the repository of the knowledge of humanity, the living index of every hard earned scrap of information gleaned in our ascent from mindless savagery."

'''Psionic Speech''': Gateway also possesses psionic abilities that allow him to communicate with telepaths. Gateway apparently prefers this method of communication over the verbal method, having spoken out loud only twice during his association with the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 12}}{{r|Generation X #1}} It was this ability that allowed him to communicate with the X-Man Psylocke to ascertain where and when the X-Men wished to be teleported, as well as knowing when they wished to return or what their exact location was at the time they wished to come back. Gateway also once spoke to the telepathic Generation X member named [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]] psionically, as well as regularly communicating psionically with the St. Croix twins.
