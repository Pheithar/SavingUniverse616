===Origins===
'''Yelena Belova''' (Russian: '''Елена Белова'''; Ukrainian: '''Олена Бєлова''') was trained in the [[Red Room Academy (Moscow)|Red Room Academy]], where she claimed her physical test scores exceeded those of her rival [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]],{{r|Black Widow Vol 1 1}} but unlike those who were a part of the [[Black Widow Ops Program (Earth-616)|Black Widow Ops Program]] she underwent only physical training.{{r|Black Widow Vol 3 5}} One of her first known missions was delivering a device which would lower the barriers surrounding [[Attilan]] to aid in invasion.{{r|Inhumans Vol 2 5}} When the [[United States of America|United States]] and Russian governments sent Natasha Romanova after the [[Deathless Frenzy Serum|Deathless Frenzy]], [[Yuri Stalyenko (Earth-616)|Yuri Stalyenko]] sent Yelena from the Red Room, at her own insistence, to shadow Natasha to ensure that the serum ended up in Russian hands. After being fooled into thinking Natasha was dead, Yelena headed to [[Rhapastan]] to stop [[Colonel Khan (Earth-616)|Colonel Khan]] and the Deathless Frenzy. She failed and was captured. It was only through the efforts of Natasha Romanova that Khan's plans failed, although Yelena learned some important lessons from her failing.{{r|{{cl|Black Widow Vol 1 1}}-[[Black Widow Vol 1 3|3]]}}

===Black Widow===
Shortly after, Yelena was used by Natasha in her plans to find out what General Stalyenko was up to. Yelena was captured from her home by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. Natasha, [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Fury]], and a reluctant [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] had her face surgically swapped with Natasha's. Wandering [[New York City|New York]] in shock, Yelena nearly lost her mind. After the whole affair was over, Natasha revealed that she had done this to try and help Yelena see that spies were not heroes but tools who get used for nasty business. Yelena felt violated and compared it to a rape of her identity.{{r|Black Widow Vol 2 1|3}}

[[File:Black Widow Vol 2 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Face swap]]
Sometime after 'solving' the murder of her mentor [[Pyotr Vasilievich Starkovsky (Earth-616)|Lt. Col. Starkovsky]]{{r|Black Widow: Pale Little Spider Vol 1 3}} Yelena left the life of a spy behind her for a short time and began a lingerie model; she also owned a lingerie empire that turned over half a million dollars a month, a couple of soft-core porn channels in [[Moscow]], and homes in six different countries including [[Havana]], where she helped keep female sex workers safe and distributed medicine to those affected by AIDS. In return for a place to stay, Yelena asked Natasha for help in exporting stolen medical supplies from [[Miami]]. To Natasha's surprise, she found the medical supplies to be from [[Gynacon (Earth-616)|Gynacon]] and that the woman [[Sally Anne Carter (Earth-616)|Sally Anne Carter]] was actually taken by the mafia.{{r|Black Widow 2 Vol 1 1|2}} [[Kestrel (Earth-616)|Kestrel]] and [[Martin Ferris (Earth-616)|Martin Ferris]] captured Natasha in Miami and attempted to alter her mind using drugs to find out what she knew. Yelena, with the help of Daredevil, rescued Natasha, who then tracked and killed Kestrel and Ferris. In all the madness, Natasha learned that Sally Anne had been experimented on by Gynacon but had escaped.{{r|Black Widow 2 Vol 1 5|6}}

===New Avengers===
The [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] were confronted by Yelena and a rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. battalion illegally mining [[Vibranium]] in the [[Savage Land]]. They attacked the Avengers in order to kill them but an intervening [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]] burned Yelena's upper body severely. Once in ICU, she was offered a way to take revenge for what happened to her and eventually kill [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]] in the process.{{r|New Avengers #6}} A mysterious man approached her with [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] scientists in tow, promising to make her more powerful than before, even more powerful than the Avengers, which would make her the new Adaptoid.

Months later, just prior to the wedding of [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] and [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]], Yelena attacked the Avengers in their tower. The nature of the Adaptoid's powers made her unconquerable by her new ability to host every power she had been attacked with. Although strengthening herself by taking in the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]]'s powers, she weakened herself by also taking in the [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|Void]]'s. When the mysterious man behind this scheme saw that Yelena wouldn't be able to kill Spider-Woman, thus becoming disposable, he pushed the remote fail-safe button and seemingly killed her.{{r|New Avengers Annual Vol 1 1}}

===Vanguard & Thunderbolts===
Yelena later turned up alive and was working with the superhero black-ops team [[Vanguard (Black Ops) (Earth-616)|Vanguard]], but was again forced into hiding when the team disbanded.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 2 12}} After the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] approached Yelena when she was stealing from an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. However, this Yelena turned out to be Natasha, the original Black Widow in disguise under Nick Fury's order to infiltrate the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]]. However, Osborn had in fact known all along who she was and used her to strengthen the bonds of his Thunderbolts and lead him to Fury and [[Melissa Gold (Earth-616)|Songbird]] to be executed.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 133|136}}

===Secret Avengers===
After Natasha and Songbird managed to escape, while Fury was revealed to be an [[Life-Model Decoy|LMD]], Osborn decided to awaken the real Yelena, who had been kept in stasis within [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]]. She was later recovered by A.I.M., who invited her to join their High Council as the Minister of State in their newly formed country of [[Barbuda]].{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 2}}

[[File:Yelena Belova (Earth-616) from Secret Avengers Vol 2 5 001.jpg|200px|right|thumb]]
During a rescue mission in which the [[Secret Avengers (S.H.I.E.L.D.) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] tried to rescue [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]] from [[A.I.M. Island]], Yelena intercepted and fought the escaping Mockingbird. During the fight, the two of them fell behind a metal gate. Upon emerging, Mockingbird was shot by an A.I.M. operative. The Secret Avengers took her body and escaped in a submarine, only to discover the deceased Mockingbird was actually Yelena, whose belt contained a holo-camouflage device the actual Mockingbird sneaked into during the fight.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 15}}

===Death===
Several clones of Yelena were in the process of being grown by the reformed Red Room as part of a plan to bring back their best agents to their fold in case they died. When a [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|clone]] of the deceased Natasha Romanoff found out about this program and her own origin as a clone, she started working against her superiors. She used [[Yelena Belova (Clone 2) (Earth-616)|an amnesiac clone]] of Yelena to fake the death of one of her targets, ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Sally Blevins (Earth-616)|Sally Blevins]]. After being sighted at the scene by [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and the [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]], Natasha had [[Yelena Belova (Clone 1) (Earth-616)|another clone of Yelena]] impersonate her to throw them off. The Winter Soldier let this clone go after capturing her, but failing to get any information from her, and Natasha killed her when they met up.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 103}}
