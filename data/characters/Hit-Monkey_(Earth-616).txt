| History                 = 
Hit-Monkey lived in the mountainous wilderness as part of a clan of other monkeys. Members of this clan took in a fugitive assassin, nursing him back to health with herbal remedies and hot springs. Hit-Monkey disagreed with this, knowing that someone would eventually come looking for the assassin. Once the nameless assassin regained his health, he began to hone his skills once more, practicing on snowmen. 

Hit-Monkey had studied this assassin, who had warned him against these evil ways. Hit-Monkey resorted to physical violence against the members of his clan over the continued presence of the assassin and was exiled to walk alone. He happened upon a group of soldiers in the woods who were looking for the assassin, and returned to the clan to give warning, but did not make it in time. The assassin and his clan were slain and Hit-Monkey sought vengeance, pick up the assassin's pistols, and killing the soldiers.{{r|Hit-Monkey Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Hit-Monkey Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
His home and his tribe gone, Hit-Monkey set out on his journey as "a killer of killers" with a duffel bag full of guns. Searching for General Kato, the one who gave the orders to kill the nameless assassin he starts to kill every man Kato has engaged. After Kato realizes that a macaque is searching to kill him he hires [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]], his best man as a bodyguard.{{r|Hit-Monkey Vol 2 1}}

The spirit of the deceased hit-man starts to guide him to the city were probably Kato is. Hideki Hayashi, a politician involved in the plot too was his first target but Hit-Monkey shot his innocent assistant and ran away crying. The ghost assassin scolded him.{{r|Hit-Monkey Vol 2 1}} A thrown-away newspaper said that Kato's daughter was getting married so the perfect place for the hit was in Kato's garden. After arriving at the wedding, he realized that he needed a disguise to blend in, so he ended up stealing a young boy's suit and tie in order to sneak into the wedding as a ring-bearer. After initially failing to kill Kato and being kicked by a horse, he was stopped by Bullseye and flung chocolate face in his face in order to distract him. Hit-Monkey was then able to sneak into General Kato's safe-room and decapitate him, leaving the room a bloody mess. After overhearing Bullseye shoot down all of 
Kato's assistance (since they saw him lose to a monkey), Hit-Monkey became enraged and realized that all he had done up to this point had been in the name of revenge for himself and not in the name of the innocents who had been killed. That was until the young boy from earlier had found Hit-Monkey and went to give him a hug and was stabbed in the back by Bullseye. This led Hit-Monkey to realize that everything he did going forward would be in the name of the innocents whose blood had been spilled.{{r|Hit-Monkey Vol 2 2}} He has recently opposed [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 #19|#21}}

| Powers                  = * '''[[Wikipedia:Japanese Macaque|Japanese Macaque]]:''' Hit-Monkey has no superhuman powers. However he does possess the natural abilities associated with monkey species known as the Japanese Macaque.

* His abilities and intellect are maybe due to a mutant condition.<ref>According to Christian Grasse, the french redactor of the magazine Deadpool, Hit-Monkey is a mutant. No further information has confirmed this statement.</ref>

| Abilities               = '''Speculative existence''': Due to both his skill as a hit-man leaving few witnesses and the fact that he is a macaque, his existence sounds too ridiculous to be true. This works to Hit-Monkey's advantage since few are willing to believe that a monkey is a credible threat.

'''Intelligence''':  Hit-Monkey has a human or near human intellect, and has been shown interacting with the world at large more like a human than a monkey.

'''Fighting Skills''': As a monkey, Hit-Monkey naturally has above human agility and flexibility. Having opposable digits on his feet allows his to grip and wield guns while using his hands.
