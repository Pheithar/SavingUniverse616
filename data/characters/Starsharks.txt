| Overview                = '''Starsharks''', also called '''Star Sharks''' or '''Space Sharks''', are shark-like creatures that live in space. They are known to be present at least in the [[Pegasus System]].{{r|Unworthy Thor #3}} Because of their ruthlessness, it was known the [[God Tempest (Earth-616)|God Tempest]] was coming when even the Space Sharks fled in terror, but already too late to avoid it.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 12}} They vary greatly in size, reaching up to lengths ranging in the hundreds of feet.{{r|Contest of Champions II #2}} Starsharks are highly maneuverable and travel at high velocity in space, though they lack the natural ability to travel faster-than-light.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #164}}

As is the case with the [[Acanti]], Starsharks are regularly used by the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]], who infect the minds of the creatures,{{r|All-New Wolverine #24}} in order to use them as living craft that they modify, weaponize, and enhanced in order to serve their needs, as spacecrafts,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #162|164}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #166}} that they crash onto planets to invade them,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #218}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #232}}{{r|Civil War II: X-Men #2}} or even as steeds.{{r|Contest of Champions II #2}}.<!-- No need to overdevelop if their role doesn't go further to being a vessel. -->

Similarly, the [[Chitauri]] produced [[Leviathans (Chitauri)|Leviathans]] by bio-mechanically engineering and weaponizing [[Acanti]]-Starshark hybrids.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 13}} Some Starsharks were captured by the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]] for his [[Collector's Museum|collection]], but at least one crew were all eaten when a Starshark got loose inside the [[Collector's Ship]].{{r|Unworthy Thor #3}}

==[[Multiverse|Alternate Reality Versions]]==
===Home of King Thor ([[Earth-14412]])===
In [[Earth-14412]], Starsharks lived in orbit around [[Gorr (God Butcher) (Earth-616)|Gorr]]'s world, feeding on the dead gods who were cast into space over centuries of Gorr's rampage and slavery.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #8}}

They briefly attacked the Thors when they came to end Gorr, knocking [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] before being repelled by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-14412)|King Thor]].{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #8}} During the battle against Gorr, Young Thor then used one as a steed.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #9}}<!--

==Classification==
Seemingly at least a few types of Space Sharks exist:
* We know of the '''Great White Space Shark''',{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 17}} and most individuals seen seem to have a Great White Shark appearance.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #164}}{{r|Civil War II: X-Men #2}}
* A few others look like Hammerhead sharks.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #162|163}}

It is unknown if they are from the same species, or if all the main group are all indeed Great White Space Sharks.
