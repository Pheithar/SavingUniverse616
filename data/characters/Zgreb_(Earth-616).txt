| History                 = Zgreb the Aspirant was a [[Celestials (Race)|Celestial]] that came to [[Earth]] a million years ago in search of its fellow Celestial, the [[Progenitor (Celestial) (Earth-616)|Progenitor]]. Upon finding the Progenitor, the Fallen became inflicted with the same [[Horde (Race)|Horde]] that affected it,{{r|Avengers Vol 8 5}} causing it to become deranged. It was eventually defeated by the [[Avengers (1,000,000 BC) (Earth-616)|Avengers]] of the Stone Age and buried deep underground in what would become the modern-day country of [[South Africa]], bound by powerful spells. 

In modern times, a team of archaeologists uncovered the underground cavern where Zgreb had been sealed into, leading to their deaths at the hands of the Celestial. Later, [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]], the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] God of Mischief,{{r|Marvel Legacy Vol 1 1}} released Zgreb from its prison{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2018 Avengers}} and used it bring about the Final Host of [[Dark Celestials (Horde)|Dark Celestials]],{{r|Avengers Vol 8 1}} so that a threat of their magnitude would reassemble the modern-day [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 8}} Some of Earth's heroes attempted to fend off the invaders to no avail.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 2}}

[[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] used [[Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]]'s [[Omega-Level Warp Grenades]] to teleport the Dark Celestials to the [[Sun (Star)|Sun]] in an an attempt to destroy them, but it failed. They returned to Earth and traveled to the [[North Pole]], where Loki showed Captain America the corpse of the [[Progenitor (Celestial) (Earth-616)|Progenitor]], a Celestial infected by the Horde who had fallen on Earth four billion years into the past.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 3}} In the meantime, the Dark Celestials started bringing about the Earth's end, causing the ocean to boil and setting the air on fire.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 4}} The [[Roberto Reyes (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] tracked down the Dark Celestials. He rescued Captain America and abducted Loki, prompting the Dark Celestials to chase after them. All of the heroes convened in [[Sweden]] shortly afterwards. [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] charged themselves with the same energy as the Horde, which allowed them go toe-to-toe against the insects. [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] harnessed the power of the [[Blood of Ymir]] they had retrieved from [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]]. Ghost Rider used his powers to take hold of a dead Celestial's armor. Finally, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] suited up on the [[Iron Man Armor Model 61|Godkiller Armor MK II]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 5}}

Despite their combined strength, the Avengers failed to overpower the Dark Celestials, and in the middle of the battle, the Horde revived the bodies of the Celestials they had infected and felled. After learning of the connection between the Progenitor's death, the Horde and the genetic makeup of humankind, Iron Man rallied the Avengers to join their energies to form a [[Uni-Mind]], since he had been passed on the secrets on how to summon it by [[Ikaris (Earth-616)|Ikaris]] while investigating the Dark Celestials' arrival. Using the Ghost Rider as a conduit for the Uni-Mind, the Avengers rendered the Horde dormant, reviving the zombified Celestials. The Avengers and the Celestials combined their forces and defeated the Dark Celestials.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 6}} The Dark Celestials were subsequently apprehended by the Celestials and teleported away from Earth.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 8}}
