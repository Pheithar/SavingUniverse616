Janice Lincoln is the daughter of the super-powered mobster, [[Lonnie Lincoln (Earth-616)|Tombstone]]. Janice's mother was an ex-girlfriend of Tombstone during his early days in organized crime. Janice grew up a semi-normal life with Tombstone in and out of her life, usually showing up to help out with bills and schooling. However, Janice sought the thrill of her father's lifestyle.{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man #7}}

===Becoming the New Beetle===
It was a few years later that Baron Zemo and the Fixer provided Janice with a suit of Beetle armor and a nano-virus as part of their plan to destroy the new [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Captain America (Bucky Barnes)]]. She emerged from the rubble of an explosion she caused to confront Captain America (Bucky) and Black Widow.{{r|Captain America #607}}

The all new Beetle fought Bucky and Black Widow in a short battle and was defeated. Bucky unmasked her, and realized she was responsible for using the nano-virus on him, when she posed as a bartender to slip it into a drink while in a bar with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steven Rogers]] and the [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]]. She was imprisoned in the [[Raft]] where she revealed that she knew Captain America and Bucky are one and the same. While Janice resisted Bucky and the Widow's attempts to interrogate her for the identity of her employer, the Fixer asked Zemo whether they should punish her for her failure. Zemo was merciful, saying that she knew no information that would hurt them. Janice was  left to her own devices, and the heroes still managed to piece together Zemo's identity. However, Zemo still exposed Captain America's true identity to the general public.{{r|Captain America #608}}

===Sinister Six===
Through unknown means, she was apparently freed and became a member of [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang's]] [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Six]] fighting [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Superior Spider-Man]].{{r|Superior Spider-Man #1}} After being imprisoned, Boomerang was secretly contracted by the [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]] to recover the head of former [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] leader [[Silvio Manfredi (Earth-616)|Silvermane]] from the [[Leland Owlsley (Earth-616)|Owl]]. To this end, Boomerang deceived the team into agreeing to help him.{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man #1|2}}

[[File:Superior Foes of Spider-Man Vol 1 7 Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]

However, after the original Beetle, the reformed [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|Abe Jenkins]], was assigned to be Boomerang's parole officer, the team voted him out and Janice as their new team leader. [[James Sanders (Earth-616)|Speed Demon]]'s vote was motivated by his unrequited attraction for her. The others noted that the Beetle became more despotic as team leader, but attributed this as a reaction to the pressure to succeed and avoid incarceration. Boomerang secretly notified [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Power Man]] and [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]] of the Sinister Six's whereabouts. Janice and her teammates were arrested, but Boomerang freed them in transit to jail, reclaiming his leadership role.{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man #3|4}}

After assaulting the Owl's base, the Beetle, [[James Beverley (Earth-616)|Overdrive]], and Speed Demon were captured by the villain and interrogated. The Beetle tried to blackmail the Owl into releasing them while covertly calling for backup. Unimpressed, the Owl prepared to execute her when reinforcements arrived in the form of Tombstone who was revealed to be her father to rest of the group.{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man #5|6}}
<!--
===Ant-Man===
Janice appeared at [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]], claiming to have reformed, and applying for the open Head of Security position alongside [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|Prodigy]], [[Victor Mancha (Earth-616)|Victor Mancha]], and [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Scott Lang]]. After seducing [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], Janice tried to assassinate him at the behest of an unidentified client, but was disarmed by Lang, then pursued and presumably apprehended by Iron Man.{{r|Ant-Man #1}}
 
===Ant-Man Security Solutions===
She briefly worked for [[Ant-Man Security Solutions (Earth-616)|Ant-Man Security Solutions]] before it disbanded.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #9|13}} -->

===The Syndicate===
In an attempt to capture Boomerang, who had a bounty put on his head by [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]], Beetle broke into his apartment only to find one of his roommates, [[Randolph Robertson (Earth-616)|Randy Robertson]], alone. The two fell in love at first sight and began dating,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 63}} although Randy was skeptical about Janice's criminal career.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 28}} Around this time, and after surviving the hunting of various animal-themed supervillains in [[Central Park]] as part of an event orchestrated by [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 #16|23}} Janice formed a criminal enterprise called the [[Syndicate (Beetle) (Earth-616)|Syndicate]] with the objective to support female villains in their careers and bridge the gap in male-female disparity of organized crime. She was joined by [[Elaine Coll (Earth-616)|Scorpia]], [[Carolyn Trainer (Earth-616)|Lady Octopus]], [[Lorina Dodson (Earth-616)|White Rabbit]], [[Trapstr (Earth-616)|Trapstr]], and the female [[Francine Frye (Earth-616)|Electro]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 25}}

In one of their first missions, the Syndicate captured Boomerang, thrashing the [[Food, Emergency Aid, Shelter and Training (Earth-616)|F.E.A.S.T. Center]] in the process, which was Randy's workplace. After Randy chastised her for thrashing his workplace and kidnapping his roommate, Janice made amends my using her influence to have F.E.A.S.T. rebuilt and granted a permit.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 28}} Janice and Randy became distanced for some time,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 56}} but subsequently rekindled their romance just in time for their relationship to become noticed by both Tombstone and Randy's father [[Joseph Robertson (Earth-616)|Robbie Robertson]], a reporter enemy of Tombstone.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 62}} Following Tombstone and Robbie separate attemptes to convince each of their children to stop the relationship,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 63}} they found themselves working together once Janice and Randy were kidnapped by [[Giuletta Nefaria (Earth-616)|Madame Masque]] and [[Crime Master V (Earth-616)|Crime Master]] as part of a plan to take over Tombstone's criminal enterprise.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 64}} After Janice and Randy were saved by their parents with the help of Spider-Man and the Syndicate, the two lovers decided to move in together.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 65}}

Janice's armor seems to be loosely based on the armor designed by the Tinkerer for Abe Jenkins after his original Beetle armor was destroyed by Iron Man. However, the Zemo/Fixer costume does not seem to have the electro-byte offensive capability or the internal battle computer of Jenkins' suit.
