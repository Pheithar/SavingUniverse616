| History                 = Mr. Jip was born in the 15th century somewhere in the Far East, under another name.{{Citation}} At an early age, he left home seeking to acquire a vast amount of knowledge. He heard of an enlightened city called [[Kamar-Taj]], somewhere in the [[Himalayas]]. When he finally reached [[Kamar-Taj|the city]], he found nothing but hulking ruins. Saddened by the lost chance to gain more knowledge, he sank down and cried. The last citizen of [[Kamar-Taj|the city]] heard him, and thought he was weeping over the desolated occupants. The citizen, who would someday become the sorcerer supreme known as the [[Yao (Earth-616)|Ancient One]], took Jip on as his first student.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 2 11}}

Jip studied under the [[Yao (Earth-616)|Ancient One]] for many years, until he was caught practicing a black rite. The [[Yao (Earth-616)|Ancient One]] banished Jip, but allowed him to live. Jip continued his studies, but he was worried because he wouldn't live long enough to complete his quest for knowledge. He learned how to extend his life span by usurping the bodies of others. Unfortunately, he can only usurp the bodies of evil people, and his overuse of the body decays them at a rapid rate.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 2 11}}

He created the bizarre creature, [[Yipyap (Earth-616)|Yipyap]], to seek out evil people for him to usurp. Jip lived for many years in this manner, usurping body after body. In more recent years, Jip had created agents for him, called [[Lea C. Farr (Earth-616)|Night]] and [[Anthony Zerbe (Earth-616)|Day]].{{r|Strange Tales Vol 2 11}}

At one point, [[Yipyap (Earth-616)|Yipyap]] found the hero known as [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] and the darkness he contained. Jip planned to usurp [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak's]] body{{r|Strange Tales Vol 2 11}}, but [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] had learned how to keep [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak's]] darkness at bay with her light powers{{r|Strange Tales Vol 2 3|4|5|6|7|8}}. [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] feared that now he was normal, [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] wouldn't express the same care she did when he was [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]]. Jip realized this and set up a curio shop in the neighborhood where [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] and [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] lived.

Jip helped various people in the neighborhood, granting their hearts desires. [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] now desperate, hears about the miracles the shop provided and enters. Jip, in the guise of a middle-aged shopkeeper, gave him a black cube in return for future services.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 2 11}} A despondent [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] eventually gave in to temptation and consumed the liquid that dripped from the black cube, turning him back into [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]]. Jip knew that [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] would leave [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] if he accepted his powers again.{{Citation}}

[[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] did leave at first, but she returned just in time to find Jip in the process of usurping [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak's]] body. [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] defended [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] and defeated Jip's agents, [[Lea C. Farr (Earth-616)|Night]] and [[Anthony Zerbe (Earth-616)|Day]]. The battle caused the being known as 'the Predator' to exit through [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]], and attacked [[Anthony Zerbe (Earth-616)|Day]]. the Predator scared Jip so bad that he fled.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 2 11}}

Later, Jip contacted [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]], telling [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|him]] that he was in his debt for giving [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|him]] his powers back. He told [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] to take [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] to a certain spot and leave her, and then return to Jip. [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] agreed, planning to trick Jip. [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] teleported [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] to what he thought was a safe spot. In actuality, when Jip attempted to usurp [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak's]] body, Jip planted mental suggestions in [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak's]] mind.{{Citation}}

These suggestions caused [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] to leave [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] at a spot where [[Lea C. Farr (Earth-616)|Night]] was waiting. When [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] returned to Jip, Jip used a magic spell to stop him from going to rescue [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]]. Jip formed a scrying screen so that [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] could watch helplessly while [[Lea C. Farr (Earth-616)|Night]] attacked [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]]. Jip then left [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] alone to suffer while he went back to his studies. [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] eventually escaped Jip's mystic bonds, thanks to the help of a [[Lamar Plotnick (Earth-616)|child (Lamar Plotnick)]] and the [[Lamar Plotnick (Earth-616)|child's]] father.{{Citation}}

Meanwhile, [[Lea C. Farr (Earth-616)| Night]] had caused [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] to become evil. Luckily, the original mutant hero team [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] intervened, stopping [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] and turning her back to normal. [[Lea C. Farr (Earth-616)|Night]] disappeared before she could be apprehended.{{Citation}}

Mr. Jip has vowed to gain his vengeance on [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] and [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]]. Recently, Jip has gained control over [[Francis Xavier Delgado (Earth-616)|Francis Delgado]], a former priest who had become friends with [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]]. [[Francis Xavier Delgado (Earth-616)|Delgado]] had at the time only recently been released from an insane asylum.{{Citation}}

| Powers                  = Mister Jip is a powerful magic user, although the full extent and range of his spells remain unknown. He has performed such effects as mesmerism, endowing others with superhuman powers, and creating physical and psychic bonds to bind victims and to prevent teleportation. He also uses a spell that forces a victim's spirit to leave his body, as long as the victim is evil or filled with dark energy. He can then absorb the flesh of the abandoned body into his own, granting him a type of immortality even though bodies gained in such a manner decay at a rapid rate. Due to the nature of Jip's body, he has a number of extra limbs and sensory organs that he can extrude and use at will.

Jip's magically created servant, [[Yipyap (Earth-616)|Yipyap]], is able to split into two parts, each part having one eye. [[Yipyap (Earth-616)|Yipyap]] can fly, detect evil/dark energy, and physically link with Mister Jip to show him exactly what the creature has observed visually.
