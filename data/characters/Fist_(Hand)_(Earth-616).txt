| History                 = A Fist is a magical creature, a sentient corpse that can be created through rituals by [[Hand (Earth-616)|The Hand]]. It is the result of a sacrifice of one-hundred of their members to the [[Beast (Demon) (Earth-616)|Beast]].

A Fist, possessing the body of [[Church_of_the_Sheltering_Hands_(Earth-616)|Sheltering Hand]] follower [[Onehand (Earth-616)|Onehand]], was sent by The Hand to kill the [[Chinatown (New York)|Chinatown]] crime boss [[Tenfingers (Earth-616)|Tenfingers]], a former member of The Hand who had stolen power from them. The Fist then targeted several followers of the Tenfingers's church when he bestowed his power upon them to escape. The civilians were eventually rescued by [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], who neutralized the Fist by impaling it with its own weapon.{{r|Daredevil Vol 5 5}}
