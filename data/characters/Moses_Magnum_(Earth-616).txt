===Origin===
'''Moses Magnum''' was fascinated with weapons as a youth. When [[Italy]] invaded [[Ethiopia]] (1935-1936), he joined the invaders against his own people. He eventually became the world's foremost independent weapons manufacturer. When Magnum's [[Deterrence Research Corporation (Earth-616)|Deterrence Research Corporation]] (DRC) was hired to develop a toxic biochemical gas, he tested it on kidnapped innocents. The [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] and [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] shut down this operation, though Magnum narrowly escaped death.{{r|Giant-Size Spider-Man #4}}

As '''Magnum Force''', he established a mining operation on [[Katsyu Shima]] island to tap Earth's core's potential energy. His forces abducted geophysicist Amanda Sheridan for her knowledge of the region, but they were opposed by [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Power Man (Luke Cage)]], hired to protect her by Sheridan's grandmother Samantha, whose grandson and his family had been killed by Magnum. Magnum’s drilling triggered a massive earthquake which Cage and Sheridan escaped, but Magnum fell into the drill shaft to his apparent death.{{r|Power Man Annual #1}} He was saved by the mutant conqueror [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]], who gave Magnum seismic powers in return for his servitude.{{r|Classic X-Men #25}}

Supplied with additional technology by [[They Who Wield Power (Earth-616)|They Who Wield Power]], Magnum subsequently threatened to sink [[Japan]] if he was not proclaimed its ruler, destroying the port city of [[Agarashima]] to prove his intentions. Opposed by the visiting [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and national hero [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]], Magnum ultimately unleashed his power but was countered by [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], who burned out his own power to block Magnum’s seismic energy. The resultant explosion destroyed Magnum’s base, but Magnum survived.{{r|X-Men #118|119}} Re-establishing his company as Magnum Munitions, Magnum purchased the classified [[Deathlok]] cyborg technology from Cybertek. After the criminal High-Tech stole the technology, Magnum sent one of his agents in a massive “Terrordome” weapons platform to retrieve it, but was thwarted by [[Michael Collins (Earth-616)|Deathlok (Michael Collins)]].{{r|Deathlok Vol 2 #11}} Magnum subsequently bid against rival weapons manufacturers [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.)]] for a defense contract, destroying their world headquarters after they refused to withdraw their bid.{{r|Deathlok #22}}

===Conquering [[Canaan]]===
Magnum and his army took over Canaan, usurping the power of its king, [[Baru (Earth-616)|Baru]], thus acquiring [[diplomatic immunity]]. He used the countries money from contract to broaden Canaan's industrial base.{{r|Deathlok Vol 2 #22}} He sent [[Phreak]] to steal military secrets from [[Wakanda]]. He was stopped by [[Michael Collins (Earth-616)|Deathlok]] who was helping [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] fix some computer problems.{{r|Deathlok Vol 2 #22}} He then sent a [[Terrordome]] to steal the rest. They managed to stop the Terrordome and traced it back to Canaan. They traveled to the small nation to talk to King Baru, but they soon learned of Magnum's conquest of the country. Magnum then killed the Terrordome operator for his failure. They were forced to leave rather then create a diplomatic incident. He then sent [[Killjoy (Earth-616)|Killjoy]] to assassinate T'Challa in order to throw Wakanda into chaos.{{r|Deathlok Vol 2 #23}}He then claimed Canaan the homeland of African-Americans.{{r|Deathlok Vol 2 #23}} They defeated Killjoy, but both were injured in the fight. Magnum contacted Deathlok via hologram and offered him a place in his country if he would secure the [[Mena Ngai|Great Mound]] of [[Vibranium]]. He refused, so he sent a squadron of Terrordomes to assault [[Birnin Zana (Earth)|Central Wakanda]].{{r|Deathlok Vol 2 #24}} Deathlok was able to confront Magnum himself and defeated him after a short struggle. Without Magnum's leadership his armies surrendered and Canaan was free once again.{{r|Deathlok Vol 2 #25}}

===Avengers===
For his failures, Apocalypse punished Magnum by stripping him of control over his power, resulting in Magnum triggering an earthquake whenever he touched solid ground. Desperate to redeem himself, Magnum made base on the massive floating resort Evangeline and had his forces steal an experimental seismic cannon to help stabilize his powers, bringing them into conflict with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. With his control over his powers seemingly enhanced by the cannon, Magnum intended to destroy the U.S. Eastern seaboard, but was opposed by the Avengers and neophyte heroes [[Delroy Garrett Jr. (Earth-616)|Triathlon]] and [[Maria de Guadalupe Santiago (Earth-616)|Silverclaw]]. Knocked onto the nearby island of Martinique during the battle, Magnum triggered an earthquake that opened up a chasm beneath him, once again falling to his apparent death.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 #8|#9}}

Magnum represented Canaan in the [[Pan-African Congress on the Treatment of Superhumans (Earth-616)|Pan-African Congress on the Treatment of Superhumans]], hosted in [[Wakanda]] in search of a consensus on how to react to the [[United States of America|American]] [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. The representatives failed to reach an agreement before the Congress disbanded.{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report Vol 1 1}}

===Daken===
In an attempt to make [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]] more popular, [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] used Magnum and three other criminals to make him act as a hero. Daken was severely beaten by Magnum's seismic force and was left almost dead. The Dark Wolverine later tracked down and killed some of the criminals, but Magnum apparently survived.{{r|Dark Wolverine #80}}

Moses Magnum later resurfaced as a major figure in the international criminal underworld.{{r|Storm Vol 3 #4|5}}

| Powers                  = 
'''Seismic Wave Generation:''' Moses Magnum possesses the superhuman ability to generate powerful seismic waves from his hands, creating highly destructive effects. The vibrations can cause an inorganic object to shatter or crumble into dust. When directed against large objects like buildings or upon the earth itself, the vibrations can produce effects similar to those of an earthquake or avalanches within limited areas. Moses Magnum need not touch an object to affect it: he can direct the vibrations against it from some distance away.

Moses Magnum is himself invulnerable to the effects of generating these intense vibratory waves. However, if the vibrations were to be reflected back upon him, he would be injured by it.

| Abilities               = Magnum is a talented weapons designer whose creations include the Terrordome weapons platforms and armored Magnum Shell suits. 

Skilled in business and politics, and a capable tactician. He has also been shown to be a skilled hand-to-hand combatant.

| Weapons                 = Prior to his empowerment, Magnum’s weapons included finger-mounted force blasters and knockout gas.

| Notes                   = Originally, Moses Magnum's seismic powers were a spontaneous mutation caused by the accident he suffered in {{cl|Power Man Annual #1}}. {{cl|Classic X-Men #25}} altered the dialogue and added new scenes to {{cl|X-Men #119}} to show Apocalypse was responsible.
