===Origin===
A.I.M. first began during [[World War II]] when [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron von Strucker]] organized a group of brilliant scientists whose sole dedication was to acquire and develop power through technological means, that would overthrow the government.{{Citation}} 

[[File:Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1 0001.png|thumb|300px|left|[[Advanced Idea Mechanics Uniform|A.I.M. Uniform]]]]

Baron Wolfgang von Strucker used A.I.M. to develop advanced technological weaponry for his secret subversive organization, [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]. Although Hydra suffered a major defeat, it continued to exist secretly over the following decades, continually growing and building in strength. The group of scientists grew in number over the years, and made great advances in various fields: robotics, bio-engineering, bionics, and physics. Eventually the scientists publicly incorporated their organization under the name of Advanced Idea Mechanics. A.I.M. or Hydra's goals and activities were subversive and kept secret. Hydra's existence remained unknown for a time. A.I.M. was believed by both the public and by intelligence organizations to be an international cartel dealing with the development and marketing of new technological products. A.I.M. gained great influence with the U.S. government in its role as a supplier of hardware and weaponry to governmental and quasi-governmental agencies.{{Citation}}

{{Quote/draft|Don't trust the beekeepers, eh? Fair enough. I don't trust 'em either.|[[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]]|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 40}}

===Division of T.H.E.M.===
After [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D]] defeated Hydra, A.I.M. attempted to force S.H.I.E.L.D Director [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] out of his position. This attempt, publicly led by [[Bornag Royale (Earth-616)|Count Bornag Royale]], failed. Instead, Fury exposed A.I.M. as a subversive organization. Although S.H.I.E.L.D believed it had put an end to A.I.M.'s operation, much of the organization's membership escaped capture. A.I.M.'s links with the secretly active Hydra remained undiscovered.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 #146}} A.I.M. had created a wide variety of advanced technological weaponry, and - during the period when it was an arm of Hydra - made great strides in creating androids, which the organization employed as assassins. During this period A.I.M. members sometimes referred to themselves as agents of [[THEM (Earth-616)|T.H.E.M.]]. "T.H.E.M." was the code name of the Hydra core group which governed Hydra and its subsidiary.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 #147|149}} 

===[[Cosmic Cube]]===
[[File:Cosmic_Cube_from_Tales_of_Suspense_Vol_1_79.jpg|left|thumb|300px]]
The [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] hired A.I.M. to create the [[Cosmic Cube]], an unimaginably powerful object capable of restructuring reality. A.I.M. manufactured the containing device - the cube - not the reality-transforming energy itself, whose nature and origin remain mysteries.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 79}} 

An A.I.M. scientist was saved from a plane crash by Captain America. On the brink of death, the agent told Cap that they had created the Cosmic Cube, and that they were betrayed by the Red Skull. The Skull took control of key members of A.I.M. with neural devices in order to obtain the Cosmic Cube for his own use. Tracking the Skull to A.I.M.'s island base, Cap arrived too late to stop the A.I.M. agent under the Skull's control from handing the Cube over to his arch-foe and granting him the power to change reality.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 80}}

===[[M.O.D.O.K.]]===
[[File:Super-Villain Team-Up MODOK's 11 Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|left|thumb|M.O.D.O.K.]]
[[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|Dr. George Tarleton]] worked with the team to create the Cosmic Cube, a device with infinite capabilities. The [[Lyle Getz (Earth-616)|Scientist Supreme (Lyle Getz)]] decided they needed a way to study the cube, so they created project M.O.D.O.C. (Mental Organism Designed Only for Computing) to analyze and probe the Cosmic Cube and to improve the organization's productivity in its scientific endeavors, while still being subservient to the higher echelons of the organization. To that end, they mutagenically altered George into the super intelligent being, M.O.D.O.C. His massive cranium was too much to for his frail body to support so they placed him in a hoverchair dubbed the [[Doomsday Chair]]. These scientists unwisely did not take into consideration the theory that superior ability naturally leads to superior ambition.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 120}} It did not take long for M.O.D.O.C. to turn on his former masters and overthrow A.I.M. He adopted the new acronym for his title: M.O.D.O.K. (Mental Organism Designed Only for Killing) at this time as he was more of a ruthless killer than a bean counter in his own estimation.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 94}} 

===[[Super-Adaptoid]]===
A.I.M. created three major instruments of deadly potential which stand out above the rest: The first was the [[Super-Adaptoid (Earth-616)|Super-Adaptoid]], an android capable of duplicating the form and superhuman powers of another being.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 82}}

===Captain America===
[[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]] tried to infiltrate A.I.M. To prove to the members of A.I.M. that she was loyal to them she informed them that Nick Fury would be at a designated barbershop for them to assassinate. They sent an [[Mecho-Assassin (Earth-616)|A.I.M. android]] to attack their target at a nearby barber shop. [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] arrived and stopped the android from killing Nick. Defeating it, the creature dissolved leaving no trace behind.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 92}} Cap learned its origin and came to rescue Sharon from an A.I.M. submarine. He was undercover as an A.I.M. agent when his cover was blown.<!-- The submarine's cover was blown? This needs to be fixed. -->{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 93}} M.O.D.O.K. tried to destroy Cap with his mind bolts, but during his fight A.I.M. betrayed its leader and tried to free themselves. As they tried to escape, M.O.D.O.K. detonated the self-destruct leaving everyone only moments to get clear of the blast.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 94}}

...{{r|Captain America Vol 1 114}}

M.O.D.O.K. was later revealed to be alive and well and learned the Red Skull had stolen the Cosmic Cube and used it to swap minds with Captain America.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 #117|118}} He had survived the explosion of the AIM submarine by creating a mental force-field around him to protect himself from the blast, then using telepathy to call AIM scientists that were still loyal to him to recover him from the ocean.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 119}} M.O.D.O.K. and A.I.M. manipulated Captain America as a part of a plot to steal Professor Fosgrave's most recent atomic equations, but Cap was able to stop them.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 #120|122}} 

M.O.D.O.K. is unimpressed for with this recent failure. He turned one of his assassins into a [[Cyborg (Earth-616)|cyborg]] and sent him on a test run to rob a bank. On his return M.O.D.O.K. destroyed the money. He was then sent after Captain America, but failed in his mission to assassinate him.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 #124|127}} 

M.O.D.O.K. created an android duplicate of [[Bucky]] and sent him to work with Captain America. When it came down to it, the android's implanted memories of Bucky's loyalty would not allow him to kill Captain America, and it short circuited.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 132}} He then sent [[Bulldozer (M.O.D.O.K.'s Automaton) (Earth-616)|Bulldozer]], a giant robot, to kill Captain America.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 133}}

===Wakanda===
A.I.M. agents went to [[Wakanda]] to steal [[Vibranium]], but were confronted by [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|T'Challa]], however he was easily captured by A.I.M. and held prisoner. They soon revealed to T'Challa that they plan to use the Vibranium to construct devices to rule the Earth from space. Black Panther also learns that one of the A.I.M. members is [[B'Tumba (Earth-616)|B'Tumba]]. Ordering B'Tumba to execute T'Challa, B'Tumba found that he could not do it, and freed the Black Panther and joined him in battling the A.I.M. soldiers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 87}}

===Man-Thing===
[[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Dr. Ted Sallis]] worked on the lost [[Super-Soldier Serum|super-soldier serum]] on behalf of a government contractor. He set up shop in the [[Florida (State)|Florida]] [[Everglades]] with his assistant [[Ellen Brandt (Earth-616)|Ellen Brandt]]. What he didn't realize was that Brandt was actually a spy for A.I.M.. As soon as Sallis confirmed the success of his super-soldier serum, Brandt contacted her people. They raided the lab and tried to steal the formula from him. The only existing sample was contained within a syringe. Ted grabbed the sample and raced out towards his car while the thugs followed him. Driving away, Sallis realized that the only way that he might survive was to inject himself with it. If nothing else, he would succeed in keeping it out of criminal hands. After injecting himself with the formula, Ted's car veered off a bridge and into the swamp. The super-soldier serum coursing through his bloodstream interfaced with the surrounding vegetation and transformed Sallis into a mindless, shambling muck-monster that men would come to call the Man-Thing. The Man-Thing rose from the swamp and attacked the criminals. He grabbed one and shattered his spine against his knee. Ellen Brandt was present and began screaming. The Man-Thing discovered his empathic connection to all humans, and fear produced a swelling of rage within him. He grabbed Ellen by the face and secreted a corrosive substance from his pores, burning Ellen badly.{{r|Savage Tales Vol 1 1}}

[[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Bobbi Morse]] and [[Paul Allen (Earth-616)|Paul Allen]] came to investigate Ted Sallis' disappearance. They were attacked by A.I.M. but saved by [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]] and [[Zabu (Earth-616)|Zabu]]. During the investigation they learned of the Man -Thing. As they confronted the creature, they were all attacked again by A.I.M. as Ka-Zar and Man-Thing fell into a pit dug by A.I.M.{{r|Astonishing Tales Vol 1 12}} Now working with the Man-Thing, they attacked an A.I.M. base. During the fight, they learned that Paul was also working for AIM. He held Barbara at gunpoint until the Man-Thing burst through the wall and went after Paul. Paul let go of Barbara in fear of the Man-Thing, who grabbed Paul. Paul was burned to death by the Man-Thing's touch.

The [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Thinker]] took control of Iron Man's armor, steering him to fight M.O.D.O.K., who donned a [[M.O.D.O.K.'s Humanoid Body|giant battle suit]]. Learning that the Thinker, not the Lama, sent Iron Man, M.O.D.O.K grabbed his foe, traced the armor control to its source, and bought the fight to the Thinker's hideout.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 74}}

===Ms Marvel===
...{{r|{{cl|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 2}}-[[Ms. Marvel Vol 1 3|3]]}} Following her defeat at the hands of Grotesk, Ms. Marvel plummeted into a cavern, and was recovered by AIM who tried to give one of their agents Ms. Marvel's powers, however when this didn't work, they tried to condition her mind to be loyal to AIM.

===The Doomsday Connection===
Having followed M.O.D.O.K. across the country, Iron Man burst into a [[Nevada (State)|Nevada]] AIM base, but found it empty. He started to investigate an energy cradle but was attacked by two [[Guardian (Robot) (Earth-616)|Guardian]] robots. After defeating them he concluded that while the base was an energy relay station, M.O.D.O.K. was not storing the energy there, but would drain energy from the West Coast, blacking it out. He traveled to contact the nearby [[Champions of Los Angeles (Earth-616)|Champions]], but they didn't get his warning signal due to the blackout. He was attacked by [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] but the misunderstanding was quickly cleared up by the [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]]. Iron Man updated everybody on M.O.D.O.K. and AIM using his mini-projector, so they split up into three teams to investigate three AIM bases. Black Widow, [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] headed to [[Redwood National Forest]] where they were attacked by A.I.M. agents and captured. [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], [[Laynia Petrovna (Earth-616)|Darkstar]], and Ghost Rider headed to [[San Francisco]] where they found an underwater AIM installation and were attacked by A.I.M. agents and mutated sea creatures, injuring Darkstar. Iron Man traveled to the [[Mojave Desert]] where he came across a Franciscan mission. He asked a friar if he had seen any strange activity, but the friar attacked, revealing himself to be [[Stryke (Earth-616)|Stryke]], a biologically reconstructed, powerful fighter. Realizing he had been set up, Iron Man used his image reproducer to confuse Stryke so that he could escape. He headed back to the Nevada base, contacting the Champions on his way. Having allowed themselves to be captured, Black Widow's team broke free and headed for Nevada. Iceman rescued Darkstar and put her on life support in the [[Champscraft]] en route. Iron Man found M.O.D.O.K. at the AIM base, funneling all the stolen energy into his Doomsday Chair to amplify his mental powers. Once-Humans attacked Iron Man and the arriving Champions defeated them. M.O.D.O.K. escaped, destroying the installation behind him, trapping Iron Man and the Champions. Iron Man then used the remaining energy in the energy cradle to supercharge himself. He broke free and pursued M.O.D.O.K., only to accidentally appear to destroy him. Afterwards, Darkstar was brought to the hospital.{{r|Iron Man Annual Vol 1 4}}

===Defenders===
Carol Danvers' psychotherapist [[Michael Barnett (Earth-616)|Michael Barnett]] was captured by AIM in order to try and learn Ms. Marvel's weakness. Meanwhile, Ms. Marvel had a precognition that both Michael and the Defenders were in danger, so she sought out the Defenders aid. As it turns out, AIM learned that Ms. Marvel feared an attack from the Hulk, and so they went to capture the green goliath with their advanced robots. However, the combined efforts of Ms. Marvel and the Defenders foiled AIM's plot and Michael was released from captivity and freed from AIM's hypnosis by [[Clea (Earth-616)|Clea]].{{r|Defenders Vol 1 57}}

===New Cosmic Cube===
Red Skull and Hate Monger were visited by Dr. Clinton of AIM who assisted them in creating a new Cosmic Cube. As they went to the lab, they were briefed on the previous versions of the Cube.

S.H.I.E.L.D. tried to stop them but Red Skull fled with the new Cosmic Cube.{{r|Super-Villain Team-Up Vol 1 17}}

===Other Threats===

[[Team America]] moved against an AIM base, retrieving a strange crystal from it.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 6}}

AIM attacked [[Project Pegasus]] to steal from it. Captain America responded to Pegasus' distress call, arriving in time to stop [[Wundarr (Earth-616)|Aquarian]] from leaving with the Cube. AIM took advantage of Cap's misunderstanding of Aquarian's motives and captured the Cube. Cap and Aquarian followed AIM to their facility. As Cap battled AIM agents, [[Bernard Worrell (Earth-616)|Bernard Worrell]] took control of the Cube. Cap and Aquarian confronted Worrell. Despite Aquarian's warning that Worrell was causing the Cube pain, Worrell used the Cube to alter reality in multiple attacks. He however was stopped and the Cube was returned to its containment.{{r|Captain America Annual Vol 1 7}}

===[[Katherine Waynesboro (Earth-616)|Ms. M.O.D.O.K.]]===
M.O.D.O.K. was pushed out of his facilities by a rebel force of AIM.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 289}} The [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Abomination]] brought Kate Waynesboro to an A.I.M. facility in [[Maine (State)|Maine]]. He was surprised to discover that A.I.M. had rejected M.O.D.O.K. and preserved the facility for their own endeavors. The A.I.M. agents discovered that Kate was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, and decide to use her as the template for a new M.O.D.O.K. Unlike the previous M.O.D.O.K. however, this one would be completely subservient to A.I.M. The Hulk used a Gamma-tracker and followed Kate and the Abomination’s trail to Maine. Outside of the cliffside compound, he encountered M.O.D.O.K. The villain explained to him what A.I.M. intended to do with Dr. Waynesboro. The Hulk burst into the compound, but too late. A.I.M. agents had placed Kate inside of an alteration chamber, and when she emerged, she was a feminine version of M.O.D.O.K. known as Ms. M.O.D.O.K. Ms. M.O.D.O.K. rebelled against her A.I.M. creators and sided with M.O.D.O.K. M.O.D.O.K. pronounced the recreated Waynesboro as his new bride. They merged mental energies with one another in a bizarre display of shared intellect. Turning, M.O.D.O.K. attacked the Hulk and then the Abomination. Projecting a lethal dose of concentrated Gamma energy, M.O.D.O.K. disintegrated the Abomination before the eyes of his new bride. Ms. M.O.D.O.K. was repulsed by M.O.D.O.K.’s cruelty and turned against him. The two began fighting one another, and the Hulk leapt on top of M.O.D.O.K. The villain shot him with a mental blast and fired another blast at Ms. M.O.D.O.K. She fell backwards into the alteration chamber and reverted back to her human form of Katherine Waynesboro. M.O.D.O.K. continued firing blast after blast until he brought the entire laboratory crashing down. He then flew off and evaded capture. The Hulk emerged from the rubble and pulled the unconscious Waynesboro to safety.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 290}}{{r|Captain America Vol 1 309}}

===Venture Ridge===
The town of Venture Ridge, [[Wyoming (State)|Wyoming]] was located near a secret AIM base, where the organization performed research into new power sources. When the head of the base, [[Henry Joern (Earth-616)|Timekeeper]], realized that there was a powerful energy source within the town itself, he sealed off the town to the outside world so it couldn't be seized by others, leaving the people within on the edge of starvation and anarchy. Local Sheriff Joseph Ember’s eight-year-old daughter [[Holly-Ann Ember (Earth-616)|Holly-Ann Ember]] idolized superheroines, and made a wish on her newspaper clippings scrapbook for the heroines to come to her rescue. The heroines in question – [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]], [[Greer Grant (Earth-616)|Tigra]], and [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] - were suddenly torn from their normal lives and transported to Venture Ridge, feeling a touch of amnesia. The heroines soon discovered the town was surrounded by an invisible barrier. The heroines were tormented individually by the locals, the Timekeeper, the Timekeeper's girlfriend, and AIM. AIM had been developing various radiation weapons there for decades. The heroines discovered that Holly-Ann was the source of power that AIM sought, and they vowed to fight to protect her. The women battled AIM soldiers and a giant robot under their control with the aid of some of the townsfolk. Soon the villains were turned over to [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and the town and its inhabitants were saved. Storm left an [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] card with the mutant Holly, should she wish to explore her power further.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel Vol 1 16}}

===Death of M.O.D.O.K.===
A.I.M. was not happy with M.O.D.O.K.'s megalomaniacal and short-sighted leadership and he was frequently ousted only to return to power again. M.O.D.O.K. was so focused on his personal grudge with various superheroes that he ignored the scientific aspect of the organization and allowed it to stagnate. The other A.I.M. leaders eventually hired assassins to eliminate him. M.O.D.O.K. was supposedly killed by the [[Serpent Society (Earth-616)|Serpent Society]] during that group's first mission.{{r|Captain America #313}}

A.I.M. was responsible for an attack on Iron Man at the [[Avengers Compound]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 #201|206}} They took over the island of [[Boca Caliente]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 #207|210}} and unleashed a microbe aboard the Stark space satellite.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 #215|216}}

After being modified in a lab at AIM headquarters, M.O.D.A.M. was sent to retrieve the quantum bands of [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]] for A.I.M.'s client [[Minn-Erva (Earth-616)|Doctor Minerva]].{{r|Quasar Vol 1 #1|2}} M.O.D.A.M. failed at this mission, and was later assigned to retrieve [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]], [[Asp]], [[Anaconda]], and [[Black Mamba]] for another of A.I.M.'s clients, [[Deidre Wentworth (Earth-616)|Superia]]. M.O.D.A.M. succeeded this time but Superia's plans were thwarted and M.O.D.A.M. was defeated by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].

===Another Cosmic Cube===
The Red Skull's underlings detected another energy pulse indicating that A.I.M. had failed again at reconstructing the Cosmic Cube.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 386}} The Avengers landed on the island and attacked the A.I.M. guards and learned that they were adaptoids. The island was saturated with the Cosmic Cube's energies and thoughts were becoming reality (hence Bucky's spontaneous appearance). M.O.D.O.K. attacked Cap and Bucky just as Superia's solution wore off.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 387}}

===Sabretooth and Mystique===

===Zenith City===
Iron Man and Cap fought past automated defenses and AIM agents to reach [[Zenith City]], learning its origins from the locals. Suddenly, M.O.D.O.K. remotely mind controlled the population and used them as pawns against Iron Man and Cap. M.O.D.O.K. used the people's combined psychic energy to generate a psychic construct of himself to battle the heroes, but they destroyed it. With a fleet of AIM vessels coming to conquer Zenith, Iron Man determined a means to revert the population to normal and mostly useless to M.O.D.O.K.. However, Iron Man was so depleted from recent battles that he could not complete the operation, forcing Cap to take the action.{{r|Iron Man & Captain America Annual Vol 1 1998}}

===Red Hulk===
After the Hulk returned from exile and initiated [[World War Hulk]], General Ross and Doc Samson had a hand in the creation of the [[Red Hulk]], assisted by A.I.M. and the [[Intelligencia (Earth-616)|Intelligencia]].{{r|Hulk Vol 2 23}}

===Going Public===
More recently, A.I.M. went seemingly legitimate, creating an internationally-recognized government on [[Barbuda]], now known was the A.I.M. Island, gaining diplomatic immunity which allowed them to grow bigger.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 610}}

With a time machine, A.I.M. was provided with future technology by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-10943)|their future counterpart]],{{r|Avengers World Vol 1 9}} which they used to transform A.I.M. into a technologically advanced empire.{{r|Avengers World Vol 1 1}}

A.I.M. managed to taunt the Avengers and blame them for an explosion caused during a confrontation between a robot duplicate of Forson and Iron Man which killed seventy-four people. Forson then launched A.I.M. troops to seize the White House. Meanwhile, their technological growth was thwarted by the [[Next Avengers (Earth-10943)|Avengers]] of said future, who managed to copy A.I.M.'s data from them while destroying the one in possession of the terrorist organization.{{r|Avengers World Vol 1 11}} With their defenses quickly dropping, a strike team of Avengers stormed A.I.M. Island. At the same time, another five Avengers defeated A.I.M.'s forces in Washington.{{r|Avengers World Vol 1 14}}

===Time Runs Out===
[[File:New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 5 38 0001.jpg|right|thumb]]
When the existence of the [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]] was revealed to the world by the [[Cabal (Namor's) (Earth-616)|Cabal]], [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] decided to investigate and solve said problem, for which he decided to buy A.I.M.. Even though he had acquired ownership over the organization legitimately, Forson refused to give his empire to Da Costa.{{r|Avengers World Vol 1 18}} Sunspot traveled to A.I.M. Island, where he managed to convince A.I.M.'s agents to side with him, and only had to kick out Forson by force. After a fight between the two contenders for leadership, Sunspot defeated Forson, who was forced to retreat with [[Monica Rappaccini (Earth-616)|Monica Rappaccini]], who swore revenge.{{r|Avengers World Vol 1 19}}

[[File:New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 5 39 001.jpg|left|thumb]]
Subsequently, Sunspot used A.I.M.'s resources to investigate the incursions.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}} Once they managed to create a machine to propel individuals across the Multiverse, some of the heroes who were helping A.I.M. offered themselves to participate in a one-way trip to find the origin of the incursions.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 36}}

===Avengers Idea Mechanics===
In the following months, Sunspot removed any employee that posed a bad influence and rebranded his new company as [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|Avengers Idea Mechanics]], now located in the [[Hydrobase|Avengers Island]], with the purpose of helping the world, primarily by funding his [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] team.{{r|Avengers Vol 6 0}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 1}}

Some remnants of A.I.M. that fled when Sunspot bought out the organization sided with the [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]] and his organization [[World Headquarters for International Scientific/Philosophical Experimentation and Research (Earth-616)|W.H.I.S.P.E.R.]],{{r|Avengers Vol 6 0}} others sought out their former leaders and continued fighting on their behalf.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 18}} Da Costa's successor [[Toni Ho (Earth-616)|Toni Ho]] eventually decided to let these rogue cells reclaim their acronym while she rebranded her organization as [[R.E.S.C.U.E. (Earth-616)|R.E.S.C.U.E.]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 690}}

===Reformation===
A.I.M. eventually reformed under the leadership of Monica Rappaccini, and hired [[Amber Silverstein (Earth-616)|Seeker]], [[Jeanne Foucault (Earth-616)|Finesse]], and [[Brilliance (Justine) (Earth-616)|Brilliance]]. Having apparent knowledge on the [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]]/[[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]] Hybrid, A.I.M sent Seeker to steal a cube from [[Horizon Labs]]. Despite the interference from [[Nadia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]], Seeker was still able to retrieve the cube and escape, but not before informing Nadia that her deceased father, Hank Pym, was in fact alive, and would [[Ultron Virus|infect the human race]].{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 2 1}}

A.I.M launched an attack on [[Pym Laboratories (Location)|Pym Laboratories]] and stole a pair of makeshift [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] Gloves, while simultaneously defeating all [[Pym Laboratories (Earth-616)|Pym Labs]] members.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 2 3}} It auctioned a new Super-Adaptoid at the Criminal Technology Show Expo in [[Las Vegas]], and Rappaccini hired [[Gwendolyn Poole (Earth-TRN565)|Gwenpool]] to kill M.O.D.O.K.{{r|M.O.D.O.K.: Head Games Vol 1 2}}
