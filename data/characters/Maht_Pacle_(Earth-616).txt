| History                 = Five billion years ago, the Obliterator discovered that he was immortal and gave a meaning to his life by tracking and killing all of the people of his species but himself; that kept him busy while he was developing new means of destruction. He was also proud of his goals.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 6}}

After destroying his species, he decided to search for more living things to kill throughout the universe. He eventually found the [[Ord Zyonz (Earth-616)|Gardener]], who introduced him to others like them, immortal monomaniacs known as the [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elders of the Universe]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 6}} None of them could die because of a special agreement with [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]].

However, the Elders prepared a plan to insure absolute immortality, first by waging war on Death and later by destroying [[Galactus]]. They thought that Galactus' death would cause a new Big Bang and the creation of a new universe where each of the Elders would have Galactus-like powers.

[[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] and [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]] discovered the Elders' plan, and the Obliterator tried to kill them. Silver Surfer redesigned the Obliterator's equipment to render it harmless, and left him trapped, without weapons, on a world without animal life to kill.

Lacking a purpose in life, the Obliterator was obliterated. He was left sitting on that world, vainly waiting for something to evolve so that he could kill it.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 5}}

===Contest of Champions===
The Obliterator took part in a Contest of Champions between the Elders of the Universe to decide who would keep the [[Neutronium|Iso-8]] that was now abundant after the rebirth of the multiverse, his champions lost and he was eliminated from the contest.{{r|Contest of Champions Vol 1 6}}
