===Early Life===
Robert Farrell, born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], was the eldest of seven children. He became responsible for his younger siblings when his mother Emma Johnson Farrell died. Robert was a scientific prodigy, and when he realized he couldn't earn enough to support his family, he turned to a life of crime as the Rocket Racer.<!-- {{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 172}} -->

===Rocket Racer===
As Rocket Racer he snatched a courier's bulging briefcase. [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] couldn't stop him because he was moving too fast on his rocket powered skateboard. However, a car pulled out in front of him suddenly and Spider-Man was able to defeat him and leave him with the police.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 172}}

Farrell hired the [[Phineas Mason (Earth-616)|Tinkerer]] to redesign his skateboard after his first defeat by Spider-Man. He hired [[Jackson Weele (Earth-616)|Jackson Weele]] to steal evidence that might incriminate him. Farrell used the evidence to blackmail Weele. He attempted suicide but Farrell stopped him and mocked Weele calling him ''Big Weele''.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 182}} Weele was annoyed by Farrell and hired the Tinkerer himself to construct the [[Big Wheel (Vehicle)|Big Wheel]], to chase Robert around town with. Spider-Man assisted and Big Wheel seemingly fell to his death in the [[Hudson River]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 183|184}}

Later, Rocket Racer was saved by Spider-Man from the [[Tommy Barrett (Earth-616)|Bounty Hunter]].{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 104}}

He became a member of the [[Outlaws (Earth-616)|Outlaws]].{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 50}} Later Spider-Man gave him a break and he took a high school equivalence test which garnered him a perfect score. This test allowed him a special scholarship to [[Empire State University]]. At one point he fought another university student called Eddie the Cross who was a white supremacist. During a fight in the Science Laboratories, Rocket Racer fired a rocket at a jar he held above his head filled with Spider-Man's new web formula. Unfortunately this poured all over Eddie and he became the villain named [[Edward Cross (Skinhead) (Earth-616)|Skinhead]].{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 56|57}}

===Silver Sable International===
He was hired by [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]] as a freelance operative for [[Wild Pack (Earth-616)|Silver Sable International]] to prevent two youths from stealing the victims' weapons at the [[Bar With No Name]], the site of the [[Scourge (Delazny) (Earth-616)|Scourge]] massacre.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 10}}

===Great Game===
Seeing as he wasn't getting much work from Silver Sable, Farrell decided to get into the [[Great Game (Earth-616)|Great Game]] together with the [[Hobie Brown (Earth-616)|Prowler]]. Rather than following the game's rules, Robert and Hobie staged a fight and intended to split the earnings. They were targeted by another participant named el [[Sergio Torres (Earth-616)|Toro Negro]], who blasted them with a bazooka. Prowler shielded Robert from the ensuing fall, resulting in Rocket Racer surviving with only a broken arm, whereas Hobie broke most of his bones and fell into a coma.{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited Vol 1 14}}

===Troy===
[[Henry Sleeman (Earth-616)|Henry Sleeman]] was hired by an unnamed employer to befriend Farrell and steal his Rocket Racer tech. He did so, taking the name "Troy" and befriending him for months. When Farrell finally showed him the gear he knocked him out and stole it, pursuing Spider-Man with the intention of fighting him, only to be defeated when restaurateur Harry Sloane opened a door at just the right time for "Troy" to run into the door and knock himself unconscious.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 13}}

Farrell briefly joined [[Lonnie Lincoln (Earth-616)|Tombstone]]'s prison squad along with [[Benjamin Donovan (Earth-616)|Big Ben]] and [[Antoine Delsoin (Earth-616)|Hypno-Hustler]] where they provided Tombstone some protection while he underwent a heart bypass.{{r|Spider-Man's Tangled Web Vol 1 16|17}}

===M.O.D.O.K.'s 11===
Despite his attempts to reform, Farrell needed money to support his comatose mother and stop the repossession of their home. He joined the [[MODOK's 11 (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.'s 11]] a group of villains formed by [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]] The team consisted of  [[Antonio Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Armadillo]], [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]], [[Arthur Parks (Earth-616)|Living Laser]], [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]], [[Marvin Flumm (Earth-616)|Mentallo]], [[Tilda Johnson (Earth-616)|Nightshade]] (who he seemingly had a crush on), [[Thomas Fireheart (Earth-616)|Puma]], [[Monica Rappaccini (Earth-616)|Monica Rappaccini]], [[Johnathon Ohnn (Earth-616)|Spot]], and the [[Ultra-Adaptoid (Earth-616)|Ultra-Adaptoid]].

===Briggs Chemical LLC===
When [[Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616)|Jeremy Briggs]] came back to the [[Avengers Compound]] to offer other students a job at his company, Robert agreed to the proposition, both for the money offered by Briggs (intending to use it to pay for his siblings' college) and because he saw himself more as an engineer than as a hero.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 26}}
