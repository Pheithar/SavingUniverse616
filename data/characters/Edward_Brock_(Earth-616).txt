| Overview                = '''Eddie Brock''' is the former-villain-turned-hero '''[[Venom]]'''. Starting his career as a failed reporter unwittingly due to the actions of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], he would go to [[Our Lady of Saints Church]] to ask [[Yahweh (Earth-616)|God]] forgiveness before attempting suicide. However, [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a symbiote]] that was earlier discarded there by Spider-Man sensed his anger and merged with him, becoming one of the deadliest foes of Spider-Man.

Going by the alias of Venom,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 300}} he would give birth to [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|another symbiote]] that bonded with the serial killer [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Cletus Kasady]] to become [[Carnage]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 360}} For a time, Eddie agreed to a truce with Spider-Man and moved to [[San Francisco]], where he became the antiheroic "Lethal Protector" of an [[Underground City]], but returned to villainy following a failed stint as a black ops government assassin. Parting ways with the Venom symbiote, Eddie began to seek redemption for his dark past - bonding to the [[Anti-Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom]] and [[Toxin (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Toxin]] symbiotes,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 569}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 17}} before finally returning as Venom and attempting to become a true hero.{{r|Venom Vol 3 6}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 150}}

Coming into conflict with the God of the Symbiotes, [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]],{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} Eddie eventually discovered he had a son named [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 12}} Eddie freed Knull from his [[Klyntar (Location)|prison]] to save his son from Carnage,{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5}} but redeemed himself after vanquishing the dark god during his [[King in Black (Event)|invasion]] to [[Earth]], becoming the new [[King in Black]].{{r|King in Black Vol 1 5}} Eventually, as his body aged decades in a few months and he needed someone to protect Dylan while he managed the Symbiote Hive, he passed on his mantle of Venom to his son.{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}}

I know we can be... you know... a little '''erratic.''' We've been on both sides of the line so many times even I can't keep track. It's a fair question is what I'm trying to say. And the answer... I don't know. It's not easy... when this all started... when I first got the symbiote and... gave myself [[Venom|this "cool" name]], I... [[Yahweh (Earth-616)|Lord]] help me, I thought-- I thought I was doing the right thing. I genuinely thought that killing [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] was the right thing to do. I honestly did. And looking back at it now... God... <small>what was wrong with me?</small> I know. I know. That doesn't answer the question, right? But... it kinda does. You ask me if I'm a good guy or a bad guy, and, well... I mean, if I didn't think I was a bad guy when I was trying to '''kill Spider-Man,''' how can I trust myself to answer it now? I think the truth is that I... I '''so''' want to be. I want people to look at me the way they look at him. At Spider-Man. I've seen it. They see him, and they know '''everything is going to be okay.''' They look at me and... I don't know. Maybe I don't think I'm good enough of a guy to be a good guy. But... I'm trying. '''We're''' trying. Every day.

<center>''This is an abridged version of Eddie Brock's history. For a complete history see '''[[Edward Brock (Earth-616)/Expanded History|Eddie Brock's Expanded History]].'''''</center>

===Origins===

'''Eddie Brock''' was born to [[Carl Brock (Earth-616)|Carl Brock]] and [[Jamie Brock (Earth-616)|Jamie Brock]], who died in childbirth - leading to his father blaming Eddie for his wife's death and becoming cold and abusive towards him. Constantly seeking his father's approval, Eddie excelled academically but his achievements were met with half-hearted encouragement.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #375}} When Eddie was a teenager, he stole his father's car and snuck out to get drunk with some friends, attempting to sneak it back home before his father noticed. In the process, he accidentally killed his neighbour's young son, leaving him horrified. Carl brutally beat Eddie when he refused to plead innocent, and the charges were dropped when he plead not-guilty. However, covering up the incident almost bankrupted Carl Brock, ruining his reputation and further amplified his hatred and resentment towards his son.{{r|Venom Vol 4 10}}

In his teenage years, Eddie gained entrance to [[Empire State University|ESU]]'s journalism program by fabricating an internship, and he romanced law student [[Anne Weying (Earth-616)|Anne Weying]].{{r|Venom: Dark Origin #1}} Though exceptional in athletics, Brock switched his major in college to journalism after reading an article on the Watergate scandal. Upon graduating, he moved to [[New York City]] and married Anne. As a member of the Associated Press, he obtained a job as a journalist for the [[Daily Globe (Earth-616)|Daily Globe]]. He proved himself to be highly talented, though even this did not get his father's approval.{{r|Venom: Lethal Protector #1}} <!--''Venom: Dark Origin'' presents an alternate account of Eddie's youth where he did not excel athletically - being the sports teams' water boy - and was a lowly intern at the Daily Globe until the Sin-Eater incident.-->

[[File:Venom Vol 4 11 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Eddie as Venom.]]

===The Sin Eater Incident===

Eddie's big break as a reporter came when he intercepted a letter written to the Daily Globe by [[Emil Gregg (Earth-616)|Emil Gregg]], who claimed to be the serial killer [[Stanley Carter (Earth-616)|Sin-Eater]]. Contacting Gregg, Eddie wrote front-page exclusives interviewing the Sin-Eater, protecting his identity under the First Amendment, until a crisis of conscience and pressure from the police and his editor forced him to write an exclusive article revealing Gregg as the Sin-Eater.<!--{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #300}}-->

Although that edition of the paper sold out immediately, that same day [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] captured and revealed the true identity of the Sin-Eater to be Detective Stan Carter. Gregg was found to be Carter's delusional neighbor, making Brock a laughingstock among his fellow journalists. Fired from the Daily Globe, he was forced to write venomous drivel for a tawdry tabloid. Disgusted by Eddie's refusal to accept responsibility for his own mistakes, Anne left him, his father disowned him, and his future appeared to be over. Brock blamed all of these problems on Spider-Man and began an intense physical workout program hoping to reduce the stress of his life. Although his body was honed to physical perfection, Eddie's vengeful obsession with Spider-Man only intensified.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #300}}

===Birth of Venom===

[[File:Venom origin in church.jpg|thumb|left|Venom is born.]]

Ultimately overwhelmed by shame and despair, Eddie - who had been raised a devout Catholic - decided to visit [[Our Lady of Saints Church]] to beg forgiveness from God before intending to commit suicide. Once inside the church, he was caught by surprise when [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|the symbiote]] that had until-recently been posing as Spider-Man's Black Suit ambushed and bonded with him - drawn by their mutual hatred for Spider-Man. on which it fed. The symbiote bonded mentally and physically to Eddie, revealing Spider-Man's civilian identity to be Peter Parker.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #300}} Agreeing to bond to the symbiote in exchange for revenge against Spider-Man, Eddie agreed to the symbiote's suggestion to name their merged form "[[Venom]]" out of resentment over being forced to write drivel for tabloids.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 300}}{{r|Web of Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 8}}

===Early Career as a Supervillain===

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 299 001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Terrorizing Mary Jane.]]

Taking advantage of the symbiote's immunity to Peter's Spider-Sense, Eddie ambushed him several times.{{r|Web of Spider-Man #18}}{{r|Web of Spider-Man #24}} Driven by the symbiote's jealousy towards Peter rejecting it, Venom attacked [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]] at her and Peter's [[410 Chelsea Street|apartment]], leaving her terrified and traumatized.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #298|299}} Realizing the symbiote had returned, Spider-Man obtained a sonic blaster from the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] and battled Venom using it. Venom took advantage of Spider-Man's refusal to deal a fatal blow by knocking him out and attempting to kill him using Our Lady of Saints' bell, but Spider-Man escaped and tricked the symbiote into depleting its biomass through overuse of its organic webbing. With Venom incapacitated, Spider-Man turned him over to the Fantastic Four, who imprisoned him in a sonic containment cell before he was transferred to a government-run super-prison in the [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]] [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] called [[Vault (Prison)|the Vault]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #300}}{{r|Venom: Dark Origin Vol 1 5}}

Posing as a fallen [[Guardsmen (Earth-616)|Guardsman]], Venom murdered new recruit [[Hugh Taylor (Earth-616)|Hugh Taylor]] and escaped to New York City,{{r|Venom: Lethal Protector #1}} thwarting the criminal activity of a small militia in [[Missouri (State)|Missouri]] en route.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #25}} Hunting for Spider-Man, Venom came across Peter's former lover the [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]], and nearly beat her to death.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 316}} Getting Spider-Man's attention by menacing [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|May Parker]], Venom battled him on the beach of Montauk, [[Long Island]]. However, Spider-Man exploited the symbiote's desire to return to him in order to trick it into attempting to separate from Eddie. The trauma of trying to detach itself from Eddie's nervous system knocked both Eddie and the symbiote unconscious, and they were re-incarcerated in the Vault.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 317}} 

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 316 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Venom vs. Spider-Man.]]

After several foiled escape attempts,{{r|Avengers: Death Trap - The Vault #1}}{{r|Quasar #6}} Eddie faked his own suicide to escaped the Vault and attacked Spider-Man in [[Central Park]], but abandoned the battle to save an innocent baby. Approached by [[Jacob Eichorn (Earth-616)|Styx]] and [[Gerald Stone (Earth-616)|Stone]], who were also intent on killing Spider-Man, Venom escaped and lured Spider-Man into a confrontation in his sewer lair. Styx and Stone attacked them, and Venom - unwilling to let anyone but himself kill Spider-Man - intervened, resulting in Styx seemingly killing the symbiote with his carcinogenic touch. Returned to human form, Eddie Brock was sent to a normal prison at [[Ryker's Island]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #332|333}}

===Carnage Rules===
Eddie was placed in the same cell as the notorious serial killer [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Cletus Kasady]], and the two developed an intense mutual hatred of each other.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 12}} On the night Kasady attempted to murder Eddie, the symbiote - which had survived Styx's lethal touch due to being immune to Earthly diseases - infiltrated the prison and rebonded to Eddie. Venom once more, Eddie escaped to resume his campaign of vengeance against Spider-Man, but the Venom symbiote unwittingly left an asexually-produced [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|offspring]] behind. Unaware of this development, Eddie captured Spider-Man and battled him on [[Isla de Huesos|a deserted island]] in the Caribbeans, seemingly succeeding in killing him. With their revenge seemingly obtained, Eddie and the symbiote chose to peacefully settle down on the island,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #344|347}} though that peace was disrupted by arms-dealers,{{r|Venom Vol 4 25}} [[Christopher Powell (Earth-616)|Darkhawk]],{{r|Darkhawk #14}} [[Nightmare (Earth-616)|Nightmare]], and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #117}}

[[File:Peter Parker, Edward Brock and Cletus Kasady (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 365 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Carnage vs. Spider-Man vs. Venom.]]

Some time later, Eddie was enraged when Spider-Man and [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] abruptly arrived on the island, the former revealing that he had faked his death. Venom attacked them, but stopped when Spider-Man explained that Kasady had bonded to the Venom symbiote's offspring to become the monstrous Carnage and begun rampaging through Manhattan, killing hundreds of people, and that Spider-Man had been easily overpowered. Venom begrudgingly agreed to help Spider-Man stop Carnage in exchange for his freedom, to which Spider-Man reluctantly agreed.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #362}} While Carnage proved more powerful than Venom and Spider-Man individually, they managed to exploit the symbiotes' weakness to loud sounds using the [[Madison Square Garden]]'s sound system. Afraid that Venom would betray him, Spider-Man attempted to incapacitate him as well, but their fight was interrupted by the Fantastic Four, who Venom realized were behind this plan all along.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #363}}

==="Final Confrontation"===
After further misadventures that brought him into conflict with not only Spider-Man but Wolverine,{{r|Venom Annual Vol 1 1}} [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], [[Hag (Earth-616)|Hag]], [[Troll (Earth-616)|Troll]], [[Demogoblin (Earth-616)|Demogoblin]], [[Doppelganger (Spider-Man) (Earth-616)|Doppelganger]], [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]], and [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Johnny Blaze]],{{r|Web of Spider-Man #95}} Venom sought out Spider-Man in what was intended to be their final battle. Venom kidnapped Peter's recently-returned parents - who were actually robotic doppelgängers - in to use as bait,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #374}} but Spider-Man contacted Eddie's ex-wife, Anne Weying, in order to gain info on Eddie's past. Venom and Spider-Man's battle at the Thrill World amusement park, was interrupted by the [[Wild Pack (Earth-616)|Wild Pack]], resulting in a ferris wheel collapsing on Anne. Spider-Man assisted Venom saving her, and Eddie was persuaded by Anne to agree to a begrudging truce with Spider-Man, with both parties begrudgingly agreeing not to target each other.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #375}}

===The Lethal Protector===

[[File:Venom Lethal Protector Vol 1 2.jpg|thumb|left|Venom as an anti-hero.]]

Returning to San Francisco, Venom became the protector of an [[Underground City]] of homeless people descended from survivors of the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake. However, Venom became the target of the [[Life Foundation (Earth-616)|Life Foundation]], which hired [[Orwell Taylor (Earth-616)|General Orwell Taylor]] - vengeful father of the Guardsman Eddie had murdered - and the [[Jury (Earth-616)|Jury]] - a taskforce of former Guardsmen, to take down Venom. While the Jury's attack failed, Venom was captured and the symbiote forced to spawn five more symbiotes. Venom was confronted by Spider-Man, who reluctantly helped Eddie incapacitate the other symbiotes and foil [[Roland Treece (Earth-616)|Roland Treece]]'s plan to destroy the Underground City to excavate a large mass of gold supposedly buried within it.{{r|{{cl|Venom: Lethal Protector Vol 1 1}}-[[Venom: Lethal Protector Vol 1 5|5]]}}

When Carnage escaped from prison and [[Maximum Carnage (Event)|led a group of other supervillains in a massacre across New York City]], Venom set out to stop him, allying with a reluctant Spider-Man and other superheroes in an effort to stop Carnage. Once Carnage and his allies were subdued, Venom returned to San Francisco and resumed his tenure as the Underground City's protector; crossing paths with other superheroes, anti-heroes, and villains such as the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]],{{r|Venom: Funeral Pyre #1}} [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]],{{r|Venom: The Madness Vol 1 1}} Darkhawk,{{r|Darkhawk #35}} Daredevil,{{r|Daredevil #323}} [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]],{{r|Iron Man #302}} [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]],{{r|Venom: Enemy Within #2}} [[Shigeru Ezaki (Clone) (Earth-616)|Mace]],{{r|Venom: The Mace #1}} [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]],{{r|Incredible Hulk vs. Venom #1}} [[Michael Badilino (Earth-616)|Vengeance]],{{r|Venom: Nights of Vengeance #1}} and a second encounter with Darkhawk and Wolverine.{{r|{{cl|Darkhawk Vol 1 13}}-[[Darkhawk Vol 1 14|14]]}}{{r|{{cl|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 117}}-[[Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 122|122]]}} Eddie fell in love with [[Beck Underwood (Earth-616)|Beck Underwood]], a lawyer who was fighting to protect San Francisco's homeless population, but when Eddie - at the time infected with a [[Mercury Virus (Earth-616)|sentient virus]] that worsened his already unstable psyche and tormented by demons from the [[Realm of Madness]] - attempted to forcibly bond the Venom symbiote to her in a manner evocative of rape, Beck ended their romance; though she agreed to stay friends with him in recognition that he hadn't been in control of himself.{{r|{{cl|Venom: The Madness Vol 1 1}}-[[Venom: The Madness Vol 1 3|3]]}}

[[File:Venom The Hunger Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|right|Eddie struggles to fight the symbiote's carnivorous impulses.]]

Initially in-denial that the symbiote was turning him into a monster,{{r|Venom: Sinner Takes All Vol 1 3}} Eddie began to question his relationship with it - unwittingly kickstarting the [[Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)|Symbiote Hive]]'s first invasion of Earth when Spider-Man persuaded him to reject it.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Super Special Vol 1 1}} While Eddie re-bonded to the symbiote, its growing appetite for flesh - particularly brains - forced him to commit cannibalism and it abandoned him to hunt on its own when he refused to do so.{{r|Venom: The Hunger #1}} After Eddie was arrested, the villainous psychiatrist [[Thaddeus Paine (Earth-616)|Doctor Thaddeus Paine]] informed Eddie of his theory that the symbiote required phenethylamine to survive, and after escaping Eddie acquired some and tracked the symbiote down. When it attempted to devour him in a feral state, Eddie subdued it and fed it the drug to restore its stability. Dr. Paine ambushed them and captured the symbiote, but Eddie rescued and rebonded to it, draining the phenethylamine from Dr. Paine's brain as revenge. Learning that chocolate contained phenethylamine, Eddie began satiating the symbiote's hunger with that, but the symbiote quickly grew dissatisfied with this solution and tormented Eddie until he begrudgingly agreed to let it take over.{{r|{{cl|Venom: The Hunger Vol 1 2}}-[[Venom: The Hunger Vol 1 4|4]]}}{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 3 5}} 

===Government Agent and Return to Villainy===
Placed on trial for murdering a police officer during one of his prison escapes, Venom was recruited via an ultimatum by the government's Overreach Committee to be a special operations counter-terrorist agent.{{r|{{cl|Venom: On Trial Vol 1 1}}-[[Venom: On Trial Vol 1 3|3]]}} Eddie agreed, but was tranquilized and had a thermite bomb surgically implanted in his chest to assure complete and utter obedience. As a government agent, Venom was sent after threats such as neo-fascists and the Soviet terrorists [[Sergei Yesenofsky (Earth-616)|Dr. Yes]] and [[Aurelio Santurce (Earth-616)|Terachnid]]. However, he chafed against the orders of his handler [[Daryll Smith (Earth-616)|Agent Daryll Smith]] and his other superiors, who saw him as a loose cannon due to his proclivity for extreme violence.{{r|{{cl|Venom: License to Kill Vol 1 1}}-[[Venom: License to Kill Vol 1 3|3]]}}{{r|{{cl|Venom: Sign of the Boss Vol 1 1}}-[[Venom: Sign of the Boss Vol 1 2|2]]}} After misinterpreting a vaguely-worded order to intimidate [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]], Venom attempted to kill the news mogul and came into conflict with Spider-Man. Venom called off their truce and declared his intent to reveal Spider-Man's secret identity to the public, but was knocked unconscious by a dynamite explosion and awoke with partial amnesia - having forgotten Spider-Man's secret identity.{{r|Spider-Man: The Venom Agenda Vol 1 1}} Following this, the Overreach Committee decided to detonate the thermite bomb in Eddie's chest, but Eddie had the symbiote surgically remove the bomb and used the blast to escape.{{r|Venom: The Finale Vol 1 1}} Venom subsequently exposed the Overreach Committee to reporter [[Patricia Tilby (Earth-616)|Trish Tilby]], but was subdued by Agent Smith with help from Spider-Man and injected with an overdose of [[Symbiote Inhibitor|dopamine inhibitor]], forcibly separating Eddie from the symbiote and seemingly killing it.{{r|Venom: The Finale Vol 1 3}}

Free of the symbiote, Eddie came to fear its influence over him, but it forcibly rebonded to him.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 9}} Venom subsequently ripped the Carnage symbiote off of Cletus Kasady and devoured it to become stronger than ever, attacking J. Jonah Jameson and almost killing Spider-Man before departing to finish assimilating the Carnage symbiote.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 10}} For a brief period, Venom joined the [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Six]] but turned on them after they mocked the symbiote's mundane weaknesses.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 12}}{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 16}} Tiring of villainy, Eddie approached his ex-wife, but Anne had been severely traumatized by the symbiote and committed suicide after seeing Spider-Man wearing his black suit, intensifying Eddie's hatred towards Spider-Man even further.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 19}}

Relapsing into villainy again, Eddie became an unwitting pawn of the [[Ararat Corporation (Earth-616)|Ararat Corporation]] when they used a sample of the Venom symbiote to create [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a clone]] as part of a complicated scheme to wipe out all life on Earth. The clone symbiote eventually bonded to soldier [[Patricia Robertson (Earth-616)|Patricia Robertson]], who travelled to New York to kill Venom. Venom eventually absorbed the symbiote clone into the original Venom symbiote to become more powerful than ever and decided to go along with the Ararat Corporation's plot, which ultimately never came to pass.{{r|Venom Vol 1 1|18}} When the [[Hyborian Age|Hyborian]] sorcerer [[Kulan Gath (Impostor) (Earth-616)|Kulan Gath]] resurfaced in the modern era and attempted to conquer the world by turning it into a medieval-esque version of itself, Venom was one of the villains he enslaved using his magic. Venom was sent after [[Red Sonja (Earth-616)|Red Sonja]], who was indwelling the body of Mary Jane Watson, and attempted to devour her and Spider-Man before they escaped.{{r|Spider-Man / Red Sonja Vol 1 2}} Gath attempted to take the Venom symbiote for himself, but Venom broke free of his control and attempted to eat him; though he was defeated and had his symbiote stolen by the sorcerer.{{r|Spider-Man / Red Sonja Vol 1 3}} After Gath was defeated, the symbiote escaped him and returned to Eddie.{{r|Spider-Man / Red Sonja Vol 1 5}}

[[File:Venom Vs. Carnage Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Carnage vs. Venom.]]

When the Carnage symbiote was about to give birth, Venom tracked Carnage down wanting to raise the newborn as an ally, though Carnage felt threatened by this and attempted to first suppress the birth and then destroy the newborn. After Carnage implanted the baby symbiote in NYPD officer [[Patrick Mulligan (Earth-616)|Patrick Mulligan]], Venom named the new symbiote [[Toxin (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Toxin]] after himself but eventually realized that Toxin's first host being a police officer would influence it to be a hero, which would make it a dangerous enemy. Venom and Carnage agreed to a temporary alliance to kill Toxin, but were defeated with the assistance of Spider-Man and Black Cat.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vs. Carnage Vol 1 1}}-[[Venom Vs. Carnage Vol 1 4|4]]}}

===Life with Cancer===

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) from Sensational Spider-Man Vol 2 38 001.jpg|thumb|right|Eddie living with cancer.]]

Unbeknownst to Eddie, the symbiote had been modifying his memories and biochemistry to make him believe he had cancer and that it was the only thing keeping him alive; including falsifying memories of him having a sister named [[Mary Brock (Earth-616)|Mary Brock]] and an uncle named [[Daniel Brock (Earth-616)|Dan Brock]] who had died of cancer,{{r|Nova Vol 3 7}}{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 5}}{{r|Venom Vol 4 11}} and that he'd had terminal cancer prior to bonding to it. When this resulted in Eddie actually developing brain cancer, the symbiote attempted to forsake him and return to Spider-Man; while Eddie came to see it as a demon sent to punish him for contemplating suicide.{{r|{{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 1}}-[[Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 5|5]]}} After seeing a spiritual movie, Eddie had a religious reawakening and decided to sell his symbiote off in a supervillain auction, swearing off his life of vigilantism and to donate the money to charity. The winner of the auction was [[Maggia]] don [[Vincente Fortunato (Earth-616)|Vincente Fortunato]], who gave the symbiote to his nebbish son [[Angelo Fortunato (Earth-616)|Angelo]], in hopes that he would finally make a name for himself. Eddie attempted to warn Angelo of the risks the symbiote entailed, but his warnings were disregarded. Unimpressed with Angelo's cowardice, the symbiote eventually abandoned Angelo in mid-air, leaving him to fall to his death. After learning of Angelo's death, Eddie attempted to kill himself and was hospitalized.{{r|{{cl|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man Vol 1 5}}-[[Marvel Knights: Spider-Man Vol 1 8|8]]}}

Rapidly succumbing to his cancer, Eddie began experiencing hallucinations of the symbiote representing his dark side. After a while of being tormented by these hallucinations, Eddie spotted Mary Jane Watson watching over Aunt May, who had been seriously wounded by sniper hired by the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]]. Eddie's dark side persuaded him to order a black suit similar to Spider-Man's and put it on with the intent of murdering Aunt May while she was in a coma. Eddie killed a nurse for getting in his way, but after sneaking into Aunt May's room he had a change of heart, finding he could not murder someone as innocent and helpless as Aunt May. Peter entered the room moments later to find Brock sitting on the shattered window, having slit his own wrists dozens of times. Believing he had done too many terrible things to live on, Eddie jumped out of the window, but Peter broke his fall by catching him. Awakening chained to his bed, Brock decided to take control of himself for the remaining days he had left, telling the hallucination of the symbiote that he was in control.{{r|{{cl|Sensational Spider-Man Vol 2 38}}-[[Sensational Spider-Man Vol 2 39|39]]}}

===New Ways To Live - the Rise of Anti-Venom===

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 569 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Eddie becomes Anti-Venom.]]

Cured of his cancer by [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Martin Li]]'s [[Glossary:Lightforce|healing powers]], Eddie became a volunteer at the [[Food, Emergency Aid, Shelter and Training (Earth-616)|F.E.A.S.T.]] center. [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Mac Gargan]], who had become the Venom symbiote's host after Angelo's death, attacked the F.E.A.S.T. center having sensed the presence of a former host. Gargan mocked Eddie for having given up the symbiote, but it abruptly tried to leave Gargan and return to Eddie. A [[Anti-Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|white symbiote]] - formed from the remnants of the Venom symbiote inside Eddie's body being altered and fused to his white blood cells by Martin Li's powers - emerged from Eddie's body and repelled it. Dubbing himself [[Anti-Venom]], Eddie teamed up with Spider-Man to fight off the Thunderbolts and decided to call off his long-time vendetta after witnessing Spider-Man rescue an innocent old man. Anti-Venom was able to severely injure the Venom symbiote, forcing the Thunderbolts to retreat; and upon sensing remnants of the Venom symbiote in Peter's body he attempted to "cure" him as well. In doing so, Eddie almost ended up stripping Spider-Man of his powers, which began shorting out whenever they were in close proximity.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 570}}

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 570 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Anti-Venom befriends Spider-Man.]]

Anti-Venom helped Peter escape Osborn's plot to assassinate Spider-Man and infiltrate Oscorp, facing Gargan - who had been equipped with a Scorpion battlesuit to protect the recovering Venom symbiote - in a rematch. While "Ven-orpion" was able to incapacitate Anti-Venom using a toxin tailor-made to kill Eddie's new symbiote, the Venom symbiote refused to let Gargan kill Eddie and destroyed his Scorpion suit. Eddie's Anti-Venom suit reformed, and he planned to resume his former vigilante antihero career with an increased religious emphasis as the Anti-Venom; curing a young woman named [[Jenna Cole (Earth-616)|Jenna Cole]] from her heroin addiction and direct her towards F.E.A.S.T.

After finding out that Martin Li was the super-villain Mister Negative,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Extra! #2}} Eddie's mental instability worsened and he began working with Jenna Cole to fight street gangs and drug cartels in the sleazier areas of New York, coming into conflict with the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]], who he begrudgingly helped take down the [[Quintas (Earth-616)|Quintas]] cartel after they captured Jenna.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Presents: Anti-Venom - New Ways To Live #1|3}}

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 664 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Spidey, Wraith and Anti-Venom vs. Mister Negative's henchman.]]

Cutting ties with Jenna, Anti-Venom later teamed up with Spider-Man and the new [[Yuriko Watanabe (Earth-616)|Wraith]] to take down Mr. Negative, exposing his identity as Martin Li to the public.{{r|{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 663}}-[[Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 664|664]]}} 

[[File:Revengers (Earth-616) from New Avengers Annual Vol 2 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-Venom joins The Revengers.]]

Anti-Venom was recruited by [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Simon Williams]] to serve in his new Anti-Avengers team, the [[Revengers (Earth-616)|Revengers]], but they were defeated by both the Avengers and the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] and later imprisoned.{{r|New Avengers Annual Vol 2 1}}{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 3 1}}

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 2 7 001.jpg|thumb|right|The Chosen One.]]

At some point afterwards, Anti-Venom was either freed or escaped from prison, returning to [[Our Lady of Saints Church]]. During [[Spider-Island (Event)|the release]] of [[Spider-Virus|a virus]] that gave New York's civilians copies of Spider-Man's powers and ultimately mutating them into spider-monsters, Anti-Venom used his curative abilities to return people to normal. [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]] was sent to capture him so that the Anti-Venom symbiote could be used to make a cure, but Eddie sensed Venom's presence and a fight erupted between them. With the Anti-Venom symbiote having been weakened from Eddie overusing its healing abilities, the Venom symbiote abandoned Flash Thompson and re-bonded to Eddie. Flash managed to convince the symbiote to return to him, and took Eddie to [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon Labs]]. As an ultimatum, [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] proposed that Eddie use his Anti-Venom symbiote as a cure to be distributed to everyone; although this would result in its destruction. Eddie agreed, and as a result was considered the hero of [[Spider-Island (Event)|Spider-Island]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #667|673}}{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 2 6}}-[[Venom Vol 2 8|8]]}}

===Becoming Toxin===

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) becomes Toxin in Venom Vol 2 17.JPG|thumb|left|Brock becomes Toxin.]]

Despite having helped to save New York, Eddie was left homeless and poor. Not being bonded to a symbiote anymore, Eddie obtained an arsenal of anti-symbiote weapons and intended to hunt down Carnage, Venom, Toxin, and the other symbiotes to prevent an event called the Spawning; starting with [[Scott Washington (Earth-616)|Hybrid]] and [[Donna Diego (Earth-616)|Scream]].{{r|Venom Vol 2 16}}

When Eddie tracked down and tried to kill Agent Venom, he was knocked out in battle and captured by the [[Bennett Brant (Earth-616)|Crime-Master]], who bonded him to the Toxin symbiote in order to serve in his [[Savage Six (Crime-Master's) (Earth-616)|Savage Six]].{{r|Venom Vol 2 17}} Dominated by the Toxin symbiote, Eddie tracked down Venom in order to kill him but was incapacitated by a sonic weapon and webbed up by Venom. He later recovered and returned to Crime-Master's hideout. When Agent Venom arrived there searching for [[Elizabeth Brant (Earth-616)|Betty Brant]], [[Gregory Nettles (Earth-616)|Megatak]] faced him but was devoured by Toxin. Agent Venom attempted to free Eddie from the Toxin symbiote and immolate it, but the burning symbiote grabbed Eddie and both seemingly perished in the flames.{{r|Venom Vol 2 21}} However, both the symbiote and Eddie survived, feeding on numerous criminals and gang members to recuperate from their injuries, and agreed to work together as Toxin for the purpose of hunting down and killing Agent Venom.{{r|Venom Vol 2 30}}

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 2 35 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Toxin vs. Symbiote Slayer.]]

Using his investigative skills and the Toxin symbiote's superior sense of smell, Eddie tracked Agent Venom down to [[Philadelphia (Pennsylvania)|Philadelphia]] and found Thompson trying to reason with a man who had been parasitized by carnivorous alien machines called [[Symbiote Slayers]]. To prove his point that it was impossible to resist the predatory urges of the symbiotes, Toxin ate the cyborg before attacking Thompson and nearly killing him. Using the sedative he was saving for the Venom symbiote, Flash incapacitated Brock, who left the scene vowing to return. Toxin tracked down Flash to the high school he now worked in, hypocritically berating Flash for endangering the innocent children with his symbiote; but the alien machines whose host Toxin had killed infected a group of homeless people and tracked Toxin and Venom down. In order to save innocent lives, Flash convinced Brock to temporarily team up and defeat the monsters, who were ultimately killed. Realizing that Flash was doing good as Agent Venom and re-evaluating his own relationship with Toxin, Eddie offered Flash a deal: he would let Agent Venom live as long as he had control over the symbiote, but would mercy-kill him if he lost control.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 2 33}}-[[Venom Vol 2 35|35]]}}

===Anti-Symbiote Task Force===
After Flash left Philadelphia to join the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] and [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], Toxin filled the void and began taking down Philadephia's drug gangs, coming to accept and enjoy his bond with the Toxin symbiote. He was hunted down and captured by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|FBI]], but rather than kill him the FBI offered Eddie an opportunity to become an agent of the new [[Anti-Symbiote Task Force (Earth-616)|Anti-Symbiote Task Force]]. Eddie accepted, but his handler [[Claire Dixon (Earth-616)|Claire Dixon]] saw him as nothing but a monster, had him constantly dosed with symbiote suppressant drugs, and to Eddie's frustration only unleashed the Toxin symbiote as an absolute last resort.{{citation}}

Under Dixon's command, Eddie, [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]], and [[Manuela Calderon (Earth-616)|Manuela Calderon]] instigated a trap to capture Carnage that resulted in Jameson, Carnage, and several agents being trapped in Grey Ridge Mine, [[Virginia (State)|Virgina]], but the entire operation was part of a plan orchestrated by the mine's owner [[Barry Gleason (Earth-616)|Barry Gleason]] to sacrifice Carnage in a temple hidden deep within the mines for a [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthonic]] ritual. The team failed to apprehend Carnage, who had been empowered by the eldritch tome known as the ''[[Darkhold]]'' and escaped to investigate his new abilities and the dark god they came from.{{r|{{cl|Carnage Vol 2 1}}-[[Carnage Vol 2 5|5]]}}

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) from Carnage Vol 2 4 001.jpg|thumb|left|Toxin working for the FBI.]]

Even after the Anti-Symbiote Task Force was disbanded by the FBI, it continued operating with funding from [[Victoria Montesi (Earth-616)|Victoria Montesi]], an occult expert looking for the ''Darkhold''. Early into their new adventure, Dixon was captured by Carnage and bonded to [[Raze (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a ''Darkhold''-enhanced symbiote]] to become Raze. Soon afterwards, they were joined by [[Jubulile van Scotter (Earth-616)|Jubulile van Scotter]], a young woman who had assisted Kasady on her boat when she found him adrift, unaware he was a serial killer, and who had also been bonded to a ''Darkhold''-altered symbiote in a failed attempt by Carnage to control her.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 6}} Brock saw his team's subsequent quest to find Carnage and stop him from unleashing Chthon as a signal that God was giving him a second chance to atone for his past wrongs, and tried to become a better man. While tracking down Carnage, Brock also became very protective towards Jubulile,{{r|Carnage Vol 2 12}} who had been discovered to share a psychic bond with Carnage. After Carnage succeeded in unleashing Chthon, Eddie reluctantly gave Jubulile the Toxin symbiote, which she merged with her own and Raze's to enable her to vanquish the eldritch god.{{r|{{cl|Carnage Vol 2 6}}-[[Carnage Vol 2 15|15]]}}

===Back in Black===

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 3 6 001.jpg|thumb|right|Reunited at last.]]

Eddie returned to the FBI, seeking to recruit new replacement members into the Anti-Symbiote Task Force. When he heard rumors that Venom had returned to villainy, Eddie travelled to New York and volunteered his services. Upon arriving and seeing that his "darling" symbiote had indeed returned to Earth, Eddie tricked Spider-Man into helping separate the suit from its host, [[Lee Price (Earth-616)|Lee Price]]. Tired of being mistreated by his colleagues and learning that the symbiote was going to be imprisoned in an orbital facility, Eddie freed it from its containment and bonded to it to become Venom once again.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 3 5}}-[[Venom Vol 3 6|6]]}}

However, Eddie was not completely at-ease with being bonded to the Venom symbiote again, as its renewed bloodlust and outbursts of rage interfered with his desire to go straight and not relapse into being the Lethal Protector, at one point hospitalizing a priest Eddie was visiting for guidance.{{r|Venom Vol 1 150}} After taking the comatose priest to a hospital, Eddie overheard a young man say that his friends were killed and eaten by a humanoid monster with huge fangs in the sewers near Our Lady of Saints Church. Initially fearing the symbiote was responsible, Eddie became entangled in [[Vincent Stegron (Earth-616)|Stegron]]'s latest plot to conquer the world by creating [[Dinosaur-People (Earth-616)|an army of humanoid dinosaurs]]. Learning of Alchemax's involvement, Eddie struck a deal with CEO [[Elizabeth Allan (Earth-616)|Liz Allan]] to stop Stegron's plot in exchange for her company's help in finding out what was wrong with the Venom symbiote; and succeeded with the help of [[Lunella Lafayette (Earth-616)|Moon Girl]] and [[Devil Dinosaur (Earth-78411)|Devil Dinosaur]]. Alchemax astro-biologist [[Doctor Steven (Earth-616)|Dr. Steven]] discovered that the symbiote suppressant drugs that Eddie had been overdosed with by the FBI had rendered his body toxic to symbiotes, slowly killing the Venom symbiote and driving it insane, but he was able to create a medicine that could temporarily stabilize Eddie's metabolism and prevent the symbiote from degenerating.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 1 151}}-[[Venom Vol 1 153|153]]}}

[[File:Venomverse Vol 1 5 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Venoms vs. Poisons.]]

During a one-sided fight with [[Jack O'Lantern (Crime-Master's) (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern]], Venom was abruptly pulled through a portal into a post-apocalyptic version of New York, where he was recruited by [[Resistance (Venomverse) (Earth-22249)|a group of Venomized heroes and antiheroes]] - [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Mania]], [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-16348)|Agent Venom]], [[Wade Wilson (Earth-41715)|Venompool]], and Venomized versions of [[Scott Lang (Earth-12240)|Ant-Man]], [[T'Challa (Earth-21673)|Black Panther]], [[Stephen Strange (Earth-22249)|Doctor Strange]], [[Roberto Reyes (Earth-53912)|Ghost Rider]], [[James Howlett (Earth-17673)|Old Man Logan]], [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-18197)|Rocket Raccoon]], [[Peter Parker (Earth-28242)|Spider-Man]], [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-18119)|Spinneret]], and [[Laura Kinney (Earth-24398)|X-23]]; learning they were waging a war against a species of crystalline extraterrestrials called [[Poisons]], which could permanently bond to symbiotes by consuming their hosts. When Captain Venom was Poisoned and Venompool defected, Venom had Doctor Strange summon an incarnation of Carnage as a last resort. While the summoned [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-32231)|Carnage]] proved unpredictable, he was persuaded to cooperate with the Resistance, who were aided by Poison Deadpool - whose mental instability enabled him to resist being fully consumed. Carnage and Poison Deadpool created a distraction to allow the Resistance to plant a bomb on the Poisons' ship, and Venomized Doctor Strange sacrificed himself to return the surviving Venoms to their home dimensions.{{r|{{cl|Venomverse Vol 1 1}}-[[Venomverse Vol 1 5|5]]}}

After returning home from his confrontation with the Poisons, Eddie applied to the Fact Sheet, a tabloid branch of the [[Fact Channel News (Earth-616)|Fact Channel]]. As a result of an article Eddie published, [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]] came to New York to hunt the Dinosaur-People. Badly wounded and trapped by [[Frances Barrison (Earth-616)|Shriek]], Eddie sent the pterosaur hybrid [[Julia Fontana (Earth-616)|Tana]] to find help and retrieve the symbiote's medicine. Losing control of the symbiote and going berserk, Venom attempted to eat Kraven and Shriek, but Tana injected him with the medication and restored his sanity.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 1 155}}-[[Venom Vol 1 158|158]]}}

As the symbiote began to develop an immunity to Alchemax's serum, it increasingly relapsed into its bloodthirsty corrupted state. Eddie confronted Dr. Steven, who revealed he had developed [[Astrobiological Serum|a new cure]] based on the Anti-Venom symbiote. Before they could test it, Eddie was confronted by Flash Thompson, who sought to reclaim the Venom symbiote. Spider-Man arrived to see the Venom symbiote trying to bond to both Eddie and Flash at the same time, and doused them in the Anti-Venom Serum in an attempt to kill the Venom symbiote. This inadvertently cured Eddie of his destabilized metabolism, cleansed the Venom symbiote of its corruption, and mutated the half that had bonded to Flash into [[Anti-Venom II (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a new Anti-Venom symbiote]]. Agent Anti-Venom forcibly removed the Venom symbiote from Eddie, but he was still able to sense its presence and began searching for it. Encountering Black Cat, Eddie reunited with the Venom symbiote and learned that Lee Price had returned and stolen the Venom symbiote's clone from Andi Benton, who had travelled to New York to get it back. Venom, Black Cat, Spider-Man, Agent Anti-Venom, and Andi teamed up to take down Price - now calling himself Maniac - who had infiltrated and taken over the Five Families. With Lee Price in prison, Agent Anti-Venom brokered a truce between Spider-Man and Venom, who persuaded Black Cat to give up being a crime-lord.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc. Alpha Vol 1 1}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 159}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 793}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 160}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc. Omega Vol 1 1}}

When the space-pirates known as the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]] were captured by symbiote-clad alien bounty hunters, Venom was forcibly recruited by the [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|the time-displaced X-Men]] to help rescue them.{{r|X-Men: Blue Annual Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Venom Vol 1 162 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Venom and the X-Men.]]

Venom and the Young X-Men managed to hunt down the arms-dealer [[Haze Mancer (Earth-616)|Haze Mancer]], who specialized in weaponizing symbiotes, though the ensuing battle led to the Young X-Men bonding to symbiotes of their own.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 21}} Turning Haze Mancer over to the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]], they tracked down the bounty hunters - led by [[Killer Thrill (Earth-616)|Killer Thrill]] - but their battle to rescue the Starjammers was interrupted with the Poisons revealed they had invaded Earth-616. Killer Thrill, her crew, and Jean Grey were consumed, with Venom and the Young X-Men barely escaping.{{r|Venom Vol 1 162}}{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 22}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 163}}

En route to Earth, Venom and the Young X-Men contacted [[James Hudson Jr. (Earth-1610)|Jimmy Hudson]] and warned him of the oncoming threat. Upon arrival, Venom discovered they were too late when he was confronted by Spider-Man, who had been bonded to [[Character Index/Unnamed Symbiotes#Spider-Man's Fourth Symbiote|a symbiote]] and initially blamed Venom for the Poisons' attack.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 1}} Venom brought the superheroes who had been infected with symbiotes to Alchemax, protesting Liz and Dr. Steve's suggestion of using Agent Anti-Venom to kill the symbiotes and suggesting using Flash to annihilate the Poisons instead when it was discovered his touch was lethal to them. When [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] mentioned that he could still sense [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], Venom scolded him for falling for an obvious trap; though this resulted in Alchemax being attacked by a battalion of Poisons.{{r|{{cl|Venomized Vol 1 2}}-[[Venomized Vol 1 4|4]]}} Opting to directly attack the Poisons' mothership, Venom and Spider-Man battled [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)/Members#Poison Carnage|Poison Carnage]], who nearly killed them before being thrown into orbit. Venom then helped the Young X-Men take down the [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)/Members#Poison Queen|Poison Queen]], destroying the Hive and seeing to it that the surviving symbiotes were returned to Klyntar.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 5}}

===The Seventh Spawn of Venom===
Several weeks after being cleansed of his metabolic affliction, Eddie began to have recurring nightmares - unaware that the symbiote was pregnant with its seventh offspring. Eddie was initially confused by its odd behavior; but was captured by Special Agent Claire Dixon - who had been resurrected by the ''Darkhold'' and resumed command of the Anti-Symbiote Task Force. Informed of the symbiote's impending birth, Eddie was angered that the symbiote had not told him it was pregnant; and was further betrayed when Claire revealed the FBI had recruited Mac Gargan to be the newborn symbiote's host. Eddie was rescued by [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]] and - following an argument with the symbiote - travelled to Alchemax to confront Doctor Steve, who had unwittingly provided the FBI with the information. When Dr. Steve protested that he considered Eddie a friend, Eddie asked him for help delivering the symbiote's spawn. Forced to separate from the symbiote due to the strain its labor placed on his body, Eddie attacked the Scorpion when Gargan arrived to kill the Venom symbiote and claim its spawn. Dixon intervened before Gargan could kill Eddie, knocking him unconscious; but Dr. Steven lied that the baby symbiote had been stillborn to prevent any further violence. After Dixon left and Gargan was arrested, Eddie gave Alchemax custody of [[Sleeper (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|the newborn symbiote]], telling Liz Allan that they could study it non-invasively until he and the Venom symbiote decided it was ready to bond to a worthy host.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 1 164}}-[[Venom Vol 1 165|165]]}}

Following [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] bonding to the Carnage symbiote and becoming the Red Goblin, Eddie was blackmailed by J. Jonah Jameson into protecting Mary Jane, resulting in her initially attacking him with an anti-symbiote defense system. Venom was able to thwart the Red Goblin's attempt on Mary Jane's life with Spider-Man's help, and Eddie agreed to help even the odds against Osborn by loaning the Venom symbiote to his long-time rival, telling Spider-Man to take care of it. Spider-Man later declared to Flash Thompson that he forgave Venom moments before he passed away, and the symbiote separated from him and made its way back to Eddie. After reuniting with the symbiote, Eddie attended Flash Thompson's funeral.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800}}

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) and Sleeper (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Venom First Host Vol 1 3 001.jpg|thumb|left|Bonded to the Venom symbiote's seventh spawn, [[Sleeper (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Sleeper]].]]

Soon afterward, Eddie was outraged when Liz proposed utilizing the infant symbiote's unique chemokinetic abilities in order to turn a profit for Alchemax. After storming out of her office, he was attacked by a [[Skrulls|Skrull]] Warbride named [[M'lanz (Earth-616)|M'lanz]], who tried to sever his connection with the Venom symbiote. Eddie was saved by a [[Kree]] man named [[Tel-Kar (Earth-616)|Tel-Kar]], who informed him that he was the Venom symbiote's original host. Venom took Tel-Kar to Alchemax for medical treatment, the symbiote regaining its long-suppressed memories of being bonded to him during the [[Kree-Skrull War]]. Revealing that years of torture had filled him with vengeful hatred, Tel-Kar blackmailed the symbiote into rejoining with him by threatening its offspring. Bonding to the young symbiote - dubbed Sleeper, Eddie was forced into an alliance with M'lanz to stop Tel-Kar from unleashing a species-annihilating bioweapon the Skrull had developed during the war. Eddie was able to rescue the Venom symbiote and the Kree armada denounced Tel-Kar, destroying the research station. Venom returning to Earth alongside the Sleeper symbiote, cutting ties with Alchemax. Tel-Kar revealed he had followed Venom to Earth and intended to use the last remaining sample of the bioweapon to exterminate humanity, but the Sleeper symbiote forcibly bonded to Tel-Kar and lobotomized him as revenge for what he'd done to its parent; departing to explore the cosmos after thanking Eddie for raising it.{{r|{{cl|Venom: First Host Vol 1 1}}-[[Venom: First Host Vol 1 5|5]]}}

===Saga of the King in Black===
Not long after Sleeper's departure, Eddie lost his job at the Fact Sheet and became a freelance reporter. He additionally began suffering from recurring nightmares about [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|an ancient draconic symbiote]], accompanied by renewed outbursts of bloodlust from the Venom symbiote - at one point undergoing a dark transformation and declaring that its god was coming in an eldritch language after mutilating [[Jack O'Lantern (Impostor II) (Earth-616)|the new Jack O'Lantern]].

Venom was subdued by [[Rex Strickland (Earth-616)|Rex Strickland]], who recruited Eddie to rescue [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|a team of symbiote-augmented supersoldiers]] created during the [[Vietnam War]]. When Venom liberated the Sym-Soldiers, he discovered they were being controlled by the same malevolent force affecting the Venom symbiote, and unwittingly unleashed the symbiote-dragon from his nightmares.{{r|Venom Vol 4 1}}

After a short skirmish, Venom teamed up with [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Spider-Man (Miles Morales)]] to fight the symbiote dragon, subduing it with one of Miles' Venom Blasts. However, a humanoid entity manifested itself from the symbiote-dragon, introducing himself as [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] - an abyssal god who had created the symbiotes billions of years ago.{{r|Venom Vol 4 3}} Knull's avatar attempted to assimilate the Venom symbiote into the Grendel, showing Eddie the true history of the symbiotes and declaring his intent to conquer the universe. Eddie reclaimed the Venom symbiote and escaped with help from Miles, though its contact with Knull's avatar had unlocked new abilities - such as the ability to manifest a set of draconic wings. Venom confronted Rex, who revealed himself to be [[Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Tyrannosaurus]] - the symbiote that had once been bonded to the real Rex Strickland - and informed him that Knull was hunting him. In order to become strong enough to stop Knull, Eddie merged the Tyrannosaurus symbiote with the Venom symbiote. Using an arsenal of high-tech anti-symbiote weapons, Eddie weakened Knull's avatar enough for the Tyrannosaurus symbiote to sacrifice itself immolating the Grendel symbiote using a blast furnace; but the intense heat severely injured the Venom symbiote.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 2}}-[[Venom Vol 4 6|6]]}}

Eddie's body was found by soldiers working for [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|the Maker]] while obtaining [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a surviving sample]] of the Grendel symbiote. The Venom symbiote - reduced to a seemingly mindless feral state - took over Eddie and eluded capture for three weeks, eventually resurfacing on Carl Brock's doorstep. Carl allowed the Maker's soldiers to capture Eddie, and for the following two weeks, Eddie was repeatedly interrogated, suffering from partial amnesia due to the seemingly braindead symbiote instinctively erasing traumatic memories,{{r|Venom Vol 4 7}} like the death of Flash Thompson.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1053446665846185984|title=Donny Cates on Twitter: "A few people have mentioned this now. And yeah...remember that part in issue 7 where Maker says the symbiote is wiping things from Eddie's mind??"|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=19 October 2018|accessdate=20 February 2019}}}} Escaping from the Maker, Eddie resolved to face his inner demons and make something better of himself, returning to San Francisco hoping to make amends with his father. A violent confrontation ensued where Eddie learned that Carl had replaced him with a younger son named [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan]], and he fled after the Venom symbiote tried to eat Carl in retaliation for him punching Eddie.

Dylan tracked down Eddie - whose cancer had seemingly resurfaced - and revealed that Carl was physically abusive towards him, Eddie agreeing to help him before passing out after having a hallucination of Dylan turning into Knull. Taken to a hospital in a coma, Eddie interrogated the symbiote and learned that it was pretending to have been braindead, that his sister Mary and uncle Dan had never existed - having been false memories inserted by the symbiote in order to manipulate him, and that the symbiote had been responsible for him developing cancer by altering his biochemistry.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1098374597559361537|title=Donny Cates on Twitter: "Correct."|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=20 February 2019|accessdate=20 February 2019}}}} Eddie realized that Dylan wasn't his half-brother but his son, and - furious at this betrayal - told the Maker to separate him from the symbiote; but was knocked unconscious and awakened to find it had rescued Dylan as an act of redemption before departing to parts unknown.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 8}}-[[Venom Vol 4 12|12]]}}

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) and Venom (Dreamstone Simulacrum) from Venom Vol 4 13 001.jpg|thumb|left|]]

Eddie returned to New York with Dylan in tow, and as the [[War of the Realms]] broke out around them he was approached by of Malekith's war-witches, who offered Eddie a [[dreamstone]] and the power to keep himself and his loved ones safe in exchange for him serving Malekith. Despite Dylan's misgivings, Eddie took the dreamstone - which manifested [[Venom (Dreamstone Simulacrum)|an artificial symbiote]] from dark elf magic - and promptly turned on the war-witch. Eddie set out to help protect innocents from Malekith's invasion, discovering that the dreamstone symbiote fed off his negative emotions, and used his considerable rage to fuel his new suit at the risk of going berserk. Attacked by Jack O'Lantern, who had also been given a dreamstone by the war witch, Eddie adapted the dreamstone symbiote into a Venomized suit of Asgardian armor but realized that the war witch and Jack O'Lantern would continue hounding him until he succumbed to his rage and the dreamstone's corruption. Eddie used the dreamstone symbiote to empower civilians in the line of fire and help them escape, then defeated Jack O'Lantern with a bolt of mystical lightning -- causing him to drop his dreamstone. Eddie spared Jack, discarded his dreamstone, and returned to Rex's bunker to wait out the War of the Realms alongside his son.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 13}}-[[Venom Vol 4 15|15]]}}

Learning that Cletus Kasady had been reanimated by Knull and bonded to the sample of the Grendel, Eddie reluctantly rebonded to the Venom symbiote. Easily overpowered by the new-and-improved Dark Carnage, Eddie barely escaped and sought Spider-Man's help. When Peter reluctantly agreed, Eddie discovered the Maker had set up shop in Rex Strickland's warehouse and built [[Symbiote Codex Isolation and Thermo-Heated Extraction|a machine to extract codices]]. With Spider-Man refusing to let the Maker use his godson, [[Norman Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Normie Osborn]] - a former host of the Carnage symbiote - as a test subject, they set out to Ravencroft to retrieve Norman Osborn only to find that Cletus had laid a trap for them by infecting John Jameson with an offshoot of his symbiote. Cletus used his deific symbiote to turn Ravencroft's inmates into a horde of four-armed monsters and bonded Norman to another offshoot to turn him into a duplicate of Cletus' original Carnage form. As Dark Carnage unleashed his horde on the city, Venom and Spider-Man set out to save as many former symbiote hosts as they could find. Tracking down the Scorpion, whose fight with Miles Morales had been interrupted by Carnage's horde, Venom was unable to stop the Carnage-ized Osborn from rendering Gargan a paraplegic or infecting Miles with an offshoot of the Dark Carnage symbiote. Narrowly escaping with Gargan, Venom returned to Rex's warehouse to discover that the Maker had fled and [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] had completed the machine, dubbed the S.C.I.T.H.E. While the heroes had their codices extracted, Dark Carnage and his horde attacked and the Venom symbiote left Eddie to bond to Banner, who transformed into a Venomized version of the Savage Hulk. Taking up a Jury gauntler and Captain America's shield, Eddie freed Miles from his symbiote and learned that Dark Carnage planned to assimilate the Venom symbiote and attain apotheosis. Arriving too late to stop him, Eddie bonded to [[Venom III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a gestalt of the extracted codices]] and killed Cletus with a [[Glossary:Necrosword|Necrosword]], absorbing both the Venom and Dark Carnage symbiotes - unleashing Knull in the process.{{r|{{cl|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}}-[[Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5|5]]]}} 

[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) and Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 4 24 002.png|thumb|right|Possessed by [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage]]]]

Staying at Liz Allan's house, Eddie was offered a spot of the Avengers' roster but discovered that the Dark Carnage symbiote had survived and been indwelled by Cletus' consciousness. Returning to the Isla de Huesos, Eddie attempted to negotiate with Carnage, who assimilated the Venom symbiote and tried to take over Eddie's body to finish what he'd started. Eddie managed to free the Venom symbiote but was taken over by Carnage, though Dylan - revealed to be a symbiote-human hybrid with powers similar to Knull's - remote-piloted the Venom symbiote to rescue his father.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 21}}-[[Venom Vol 4 25|25]]}} Eddie subsequently told the Avengers about Knull, leaving them furious at him and exacerbating his self-loathing at having doomed the universe to save his son. Venom was attacked by Virus, a vigilante clad in a [[Virus Armor|suit of War Machine armor modified to kill symbiotes]], but fended him off.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2020 Spider-Man/Venom}} Worried about Dylan's powers, Eddie took him to see the Maker and discovered he'd bonded to [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-1610)|a synthetic symbiote]] from [[Earth-1610]] and built an interdimensional portal. Virus attacked and destabilized the portal, warping him, Venom, and Dylan to [[Earth-1051]] - a world where [[Edward Brock (Earth-1051)|Eddie Brock]] had committed suicide, [[Anne Weying (Earth-1051)|Anne Weying]] had become Venom, and [[Dylan Brock (Earth-1051)|Dylan Brock]] had become Knull's apostle Codex. Despite some tension, Eddie and Dylan allied with Anne and helped restore Codex's humanity, unmasking Virus as Mac Gargan - who blamed Eddie for being paralyzed by Carnage - and imprisoning him.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 26}}-[[Venom Vol 4 30]]}}

Spending a year on Earth-1051,{{r|Venom Vol 4 30}} Eddie and Dylan returned to Earth-616 to prepare for Knull's invasion, helping the Avengers and Earth's other heroes come up with a plan. When Knull and his horde of symbiote-dragons easily overpowered Earth's mightiest heroes, Venom offered to serve the dark god in exchange for Earth being spared. Knull refused, ripped the Venom symbiote off Eddie, and killed him by throwing him from the top of the Empire State Building.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} Eddie's consciousness was preserved in the Symbiote Hive-Mind as a codex, where he was reunited with Rex Strickland and Flash Thompson.{{r|Venom Vol 4 32}} With Dylan and Thor freeing the heroes taken over by Knull's symbiotes, Eddie, Rex, and Flash infiltrated the core of the Hive Mind and freed captured symbiotes who'd been severed from Knull's control. When Flash bonded to one and was incarnated as a symbiote-dragon, Knull took over Rex's symbiote and attacked Eddie. The Venom symbiote broke free from Knull's control and rebonded to Eddie's codex, incarnating as a gigantic version of Venom. Before they could attack Knull, Eddie was resurrected by the [[Glossary:Enigma Force|God of Light]], Knull's ancient nemesis and polar opposite.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 32}}-[[Venom Vol 4 34|34]]}} Transformed into a cosmic version of Venom, Eddie fused [[Mjolnir]] and the [[Silver Surfer's Surfboard]] into a battle-axe and easily overpowered Knull, ripping off [[Knull's Symbiote (Earth-616)|his symbiote]] and flying him into the core of the Sun before destroying his physical body. Using the God of Light's power, Eddie destroyed Dylan's symbiote half to prevent Knull from taking over him, and was imbued with a measure of Knull's power - becoming the nexus of the Symbiote Hive.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 5}} Sensing Carnage had resurfaced, Eddie used his new control of the symbiote hive-mind to direct a group of symbiotes freed from Knull's control to devour Carnage.{{r|Carnage: Black, White & Blood Vol 1 2}}

[[File:Venom Vol 4 35 Stegman Virgin Variant.jpg|thumb|right|"All hail the new King in Black!"]]

Moving his family into a house purchased by Tony Stark, Eddie began spending most of his time interfaced with the Hive, which let him remote-pilot any symbiote with its consent. Eddie began using this to repair the damage Knull had wrought and maintain peace across the universe. However, the strain of being the new King in Black took a toll on Eddie's still-mortal body, causing him to rapidly age over the course of a few months. Meeting with various heroes and heroic organizations via symbiote avatars, Eddie warned the Avengers, Quiet Council of Krakoa, Guardians of the Galaxy, and other gods and cosmic beings of the Maker's plan to conquer Earth-616 and turn it into a copy of Earth-1610. Learning that Dylan had bonded to the Venom symbiote, Eddie gave them his blessing to operate as Venom.{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}}

By his own admission, Eddie was never a particularly functional or mentally adjusted man, though he frequently made efforts to better himself.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Presents: Anti-Venom - New Ways To Live Vol 1 1}}{{r|Carnage Vol 2 14}} Obsessed with and desperate for success, as a child and into his adulthood he stole and lied in order to get the acknowledgement he desperately craved and further his career.{{r|Venom: Dark Origin Vol 1 1}} His self-loathing and obsession with protecting the innocent stem from a traumatic incident where he accidentally killed a young child as a teenager, which his father went to extreme lengths to cover up - including brutally beating him when he announced his intent to plead guilty.{{r|Venom Vol 4 10}} Despite excelling academically and becoming a successful journalist, Eddie was never able to impress his father.{{r|Venom: Lethal Protector #1}} Eddie possesses a great deal of intense rage, owing to the various traumatic and humiliating experiences he has endured over the course of his life.{{r|Venom Vol 4 14}} After the Sin Eater incident and bonding with the symbiote, Eddie focused this rage on Spider-Man and was initially obsessed with revenge against him at all cost. Early into his career as Venom he was little better than the criminals he would go on to take down, venting his rage on those unfortunate enough to cross his path, but after a fight with [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] he was inspired to use his powers for good - leading to him becoming the Lethal Protector.{{r|Venom Annual Vol 1 1}} His Catholic upbringing significantly influenced his actions, in particular as Anti-Venom, and for a time he came to see himself as having been chosen by God to cleanse Earth of the symbiotes.{{r|Venom Vol 2 7}} However, Eddie's faith was not unshakable, and he would occasionally find himself doubting whether God was listening,{{r|Carnage Vol 2 15}} which led him to ultimately abandon his faith.{{r|Venom Vol 1 150}} Eddie also has an odd habit of forming protective bonds to young women such as [[Beck Underwood (Earth-616)|Beck Underwood]], [[Jenna Cole (Earth-616)|Jenna Cole]], and [[Jubulile van Scotter (Earth-616)|Jubulile van Scotter]], using them as a moral compass to guide his actions.

Eddie's attitude towards the symbiotes has changed significantly over the years, though it has been characterized by often-toxic codependency brought about by his fear of being alone, his addiction to their power, and the mutual cycle of rage-induced corruption between symbiote and host. His love-hate relationship with the Venom symbiote is particularly convoluted. Eddie initially refused to believe that the symbiote could have a negative influence over him, telling Anne Weying that it could not make anyone do anything they didn't already subconsciously want to.{{r|Venom: Sinner Takes All Vol 1 3}} However, the symbiote's growing bloodlust began to unnerve him,{{r|Venom: Separation Anxiety Vol 1 4}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Super Special Vol 1 1}} and as its appetite for flesh grew, Eddie came to fear and despise it,{{r|Venom: The Hunger Vol 1 1}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 7}} considering it a demon that God had sent to punish him for contemplating suicide.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 1}} Even before divesting himself of the Venom symbiote, Eddie blamed it for the violent criminal actions he had committed,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Super Special Vol 1 1}}{{r|Carnage Vol 2 4}}{{r|Carnage Vol 2 12}}{{r|Venom Vol 4 14}} and after they parted ways he sought to redeem himself as Anti-Venom; though his worsening mental instability and occasional relapses into his Lethal Protector persona hindered this.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Presents: Anti-Venom - New Ways To Live Vol 1 1}} When bonded to Toxin, Eddie was initially dominated by the symbiote,{{r|Venom Vol 2 17|21}} but later worked out a "temporary" truce with it, taking umbrage with [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]]'s accusation that he was deluding himself and addicted to the power being bonded to a symbiote gave him.{{r|Venom Vol 2 34}} After receiving a lecture from Agent Venom,{{r|Venom Vol 2 35}} Eddie embraced being bonded to Toxin,{{r|Carnage Vol 2 4}} and slowly came to acknowledge that the Venom symbiote had not been solely responsible for the crimes he committed as Venom.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 14}}{{r|Venom Vol 4 14}} Following his return to New York, Eddie's attitude towards the Venom symbiote had taken a complete 180, as he not only possessively referred to it as his "darling" but enacted a complex plan to reunite with it.{{r|Venom Vol 3 6}} Despite living without a symbiote for some extended periods of time, Eddie's greatest fear is being alone,{{r|Venom Vol 4 6}} and that without the symbiote's voice in his head he will go insane.{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1 3}}

Despite reuniting with the symbiote, Eddie refused to relapse into his Lethal Protector mindset, determined to go straight and become a true superhero. The symbiote's re-corruption and renewed proclivity for violence, coupled with its volatile obsession with staying bonded to him, led Eddie to question his decision to reunite with it.{{r|Venom Vol 1 150}} However, Eddie resolved to stay bonded to it and find a way to help it recover.{{r|Venom Vol 1 151}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 153}} This magnanimity does not extend to non-humans, as he was willing to eat a Deviant Mutate to satiate the symbiote's hunger, devoured an alien he'd noticed spying on him and the Young X-Men,{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 21}} and wanted to eat [[Tel-Kar (Earth-616)|Tel-Kar]] for what he'd done to the Venom symbiote.{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1 5}} Even without the symbiote, Eddie bit off the hand of one of Malekith's war witches after receiving the dreamstone simulacrum "Magic Venom" symbiote, and devoured a chunk out of a frost giant.{{r|Venom Vol 4 14}}

Despite their rivalry, Eddie and Spider-Man eventually developed a sufficient degree of begrudging mutual respect that Eddie was willing to let Spider-Man bond to the Venom symbiote in order to even the odds against the Red Goblin.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800}} Eddie also showed that he had developed a sufficient degree of respect for Flash Thompson after their battle against Maniac, as seen by his attending the fallen soldier's funeral;{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800}} begrudgingly acknowledging Flash as having been a badass Venom despite his jealousy over the symbiote's remaining affection towards him.{{r|Venom Vol 4 7}} This led to a mutual respect when they both meet eachother at the [[Astral Plane|Symbiote Hive-Mind]], Flash saying it meant a lot to him and that Eddie was a hero too.{{r|Venom Vol 4 33}} Eddie and Peter finally put their differences aside for good and became friends/allies in order to stop Carnage from freeing Knull.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}} Eddie would later express regret over trying to kill Peter in the past.{{r|Venom Vol 4 25}}

| Powers                  = '''God of Symbiotes:''' After vanquishing [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], Eddie Brock became the new nexus of the [[Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)|Symbiote Hive]] and inherited his title of the King in Black.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 5}} While this gave Eddie access to several of Knull's powers, it placed an immense amount of strain on his still-mortal body and caused him to rapidly age over the course of a few months.{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}}
* '''Telepathy:''' Eddie is able to sense and telepathically communicate with symbiotes, their hosts, and manifested codices through the Hive-Mind.{{r|Carnage: Black, White & Blood Vol 1 2}} For unknown reasons, the Venom symbiote is the only one he cannot sense or communicate with.{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}}
* '''Symbiote Domination:''' Through the Hive-Mind, Eddie is able to remote-pilot symbiotes, enabling him to see through their eyes, speak through them, and manipulate their biomasses even when not in direct contact with them;{{r|Carnage: Black, White & Blood Vol 1 2}} using them to create avatars of both his Venom and human forms. Having severed it from the Hive by freeing it from Knull's control, the Venom symbiote is the only one he cannot remote-pilot.{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}}
* '''Temporal Manipulation:''' Being capable of seeing through the eyes of every symbiote that ever existed, Eddie theorized that he might be able to use the symbiote hive-mind to effectively time-travel and thus alter the past -- much like Knull once tried to do to prematurely bring about his awakening.{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}}{{r|{{cl|Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 1}}-[[Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 5|5]]}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Powers
| body  = Eddie Brock bonded with three symbiotes over the years, formerly returning with Venom. The other two were Toxin, the offspring of Carnage; and Anti-Venom, a non-sentient symbiote composed of the remnants of the Venom symbiote in Brock's bloodstream fused with his white blood cells by Martin Li's [[Glossary:Lightforce|Lightforce]].

<big>'''Venom'''</big>

{{main|Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)#Powers}}

'''Black-and-White Symbiotic Costume:''' The alien costume, which had grafted itself to the nervous system of Eddie Brock, somehow absorbed the powers of Spider-Man during its brief symbiotic relationship with him, seemingly due to the lasting impression that Spider-Man had on its psyche due to being rejected by him. These powers had been transferred to Brock, so long as he wore the costume, and combined with Eddie's natural bulk made Venom physically stronger than Spider-Man. Ultimately the costume's influence hurt more than helped Brock's psyche and when he finally realized this, he decided to auction it. Several years later, Eddie reclaimed it, becoming Venom once more; though the pair eventually had a falling out when Eddie discovered the symbiote had been altering his memories and making him sick in order to gaslight him into staying bonded to it. While connected to [[Dylan Brock (Earth-1051)|Codex]]'s hive-mind, the symbiote acquired the ability to manifest an arm-cannon capable of firing powerful energy beams, but this was lost upon returning to Earth-616. The symbiote grants Eddie the following powers:
*'''Superhuman Strength'''
*'''Superhuman Speed'''
*'''Superhuman Agility'''
*'''Superhuman Senses'''
*'''Superhuman Stamina'''
*'''Superhuman Reflexes'''
*'''Superhuman Durability'''
*'''Regenerative Healing Factor'''
*'''Webbing Generation'''
*'''Wall-Crawling'''
*'''Offspring Detection'''
*'''Genetic Memory'''
*'''ESP'''
*'''Spider-Sense Immunity'''
*'''Constituent-Matter Generation'''
*'''Constituent-Matter Manipulation'''
*'''Invisibility'''
*'''Shapeshifting'''
*'''Night Vision'''
*'''Spider-Man Detection'''
*'''Venomous Fangs'''
*'''Telepathy Resistance'''
*'''Empathetic Empowerment'''
*'''Energy Transference'''
**'''Energy Absorption'''

<big>'''Anti-Venom'''</big>

When the symbiote abandoned him, Eddie's cancer began spreading at an exponential rate. After the events of [[Brand New Day]], Mr. Li cured him of his cancer and, due to the remnants of the symbiote left in his body, Eddie developed new powers. These remnants fused with Eddie's white blood cells which resulted in a new white symbiote that grants Eddie the majority of his old powers along with powerful new ones as Anti-Venom.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 568|570}}

'''White Symbiotic Costume:''' The alien costume's remnants remained grafted to the nervous system of Eddie Brock, and fused with his white blood cells. This new ''white'' symbiote seems to not only be different in appearance and abilities, but even acts completely different from the original symbiote it evolved from. For instance, Eddie Brock refers to himself in first person as Anti-Venom, and is in complete control of his actions. This relationship is somewhat similar to Cletus Kasady's and the Carnage symbiote: Both symbiotes are bonded to their hosts at the cellular level and seem to compliment the user's personality (the Carnage symbiote loves to kill, and the Anti-Venom symbiote wants to destroy Venom.) However the white symbiote, unlike the other members of its race, seemingly has no influence on Eddie's actions, which is a far cry from his first symbiotic relationship. 
* '''''External Symbiote Rejection:''''' Upon being assaulted by Mac Gargan, the Venom symbiote attempts to leave Gargan to bond with Brock again. However Brock's skin is caustic to his former symbiote, which means the white symbiote has the ability to reject the Venom symbiote and presumably all of its children as well.
* '''''Constituent-Matter Manipulation:''''' Anti-Venom can manipulate his matter to enlarge or stretch his body in order to augment his attacks. For example, he enlarged his fist and slammed it into Mac Gargan creating more of an impact. He can morph sections of his body, such as his hands or feet, into spikes, blades, axes or a shield.
* '''''Impurity Sense:''''' Anti-Venom can sense foreign substances within a person's body which includes symbiotes, radiation, narcotics, viruses, and diseases.
* '''''Internal Bodily Cleansing:''''' After sensing the impurity, Anti-Venom can forcefully "cure" the substance from the person's body. He uses this ability to almost completely destroy his old symbiote and to cure a young girl from her heroin addiction. This power can also be used to depower some superhumans, almost ridding Spider-Man of the radiation in his blood when attempting to destroy remnants of the symbiote, and nearly cleanses Radioactive Man of his powers in a similar fashion.
* '''''Spider-Power Negation:''''' After failing to cleanse Spider-Man of his symbiote remnants and radiation in his blood, whenever Anti-Venom is too close to Peter his powers are effectively canceled until Eddie becomes distant enough from him. Alternatively, when Anti-Venom ensnares Spider-Man by binding with the bits of the suit that is fired off as webbing, it also negates Spider-Man's powers until Spider-Man breaks free from it.
* '''''Fire Immunity:''''' In contrast to the other symbiotes, Anti-Venom is immune to fire and extreme heat. Examples of this includes withstanding the full force of one of the Punisher's flamethrowers and a superhot radioactive blast from Radioactive Man meant to immobilize Venom if he became out of control.
* '''''Sonic Immunity:''''' Besides immunity to fire and heat, Anti-Venom also shows strong resistance against sonic-based attacks. For example, he was capable of withstanding Songbird's sonic-blast without any discomfort.

Excluding these new powers granted by the ''white'' symbiote, Anti-Venom still retained almost every power Eddie had while bonded with the Venom symbiote, including:
* '''''Superhuman Strength''''' 
* '''''Superhuman Durability''''' 
* '''''Superhuman Stamina''''' 
* '''''Superhuman Speed'''''
* '''''Superhuman Agility'''''
* '''''Superhuman Reflexes'''''
* '''''Regenerative Healing Factor'''''
* '''''Camouflage Capabilities''''' 
* '''''Elasticity''''' 
* '''''Webbing Generation'''''  
* '''''Constituent Matter Generation'''''
* '''''Wall-Crawling''''' 
* '''''Offspring Detection''''' 
* '''''Genetic Memory''''' 
* '''''ESP''''' 
* '''''Spider-Sense Immunity'''''
* '''''Night Vision'''''

<big>'''Toxin'''</big>

'''Red and Black Symbiotic Costume:''' Toxin possesses the "unique" special abilities of his two symbiote predecessors. He can stick to walls, can change his identity to that of a completely different person and also has unlimited webbing, which takes on a shape of a steel chain in his case. Toxin can also blend in with its surroundings and become undetectable, and he can form solid weapons from his limbs like his father. Toxin also seems to have some sort of quick-healing ability like his predecessors, as his wounds from his first battle with Razor Fist healed instantly. Unlike the others, Toxin can track anyone, not just other symbiotes, as long as he has something to begin from, within the entire city of New York and possibly further. 

In addition, he seems to have a much stronger resistance to sonic attacks and intense heat compared to Carnage. As Toxin, Eddie can grow immensely in height whenever he is angry or loses control of the symbiote,{{r|Venom Vol 2 18}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 21}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 34}} and initially possesses a red body with black eyespots, small white eyes, and dozens of tendrils protruding from his back and shoulders.{{r|Venom Vol 2 17}} When confronting Venom in Philadelphia, Toxin's lower body and forearms were black with red veins.{{r|Venom Vol 2 34}} After joining the FBI, his appearance changed drastically, turning black with spikes on his legs, a red stylized spider emblem on his chest, eyespots, utility belt, pauldrons, and vambraces.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 4}}
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' He possesses vast superhuman strength, and is stronger than Spider-Man. Depending on how angry or upset he gets, he grows to a much larger size, with large claws and vicious fangs. His strength extends to his legs allowing him to leap heights and distances impossible for a normal human. 
* '''Superhuman Speed:''' He can move or run at speeds greater than any normal human being.
* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' He can exert himself for at least 48 hours until fatigue impairs him.
* '''Superhuman Agility:''' His agility is superior to any normal human being.
* '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' His reflexes are superior to any normal human being.
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' He is much more resistant to injury than Spider Man. The tissue the symbiote is composed of renders Brock's body much harder and much more resistant to physical injury than the body of an ordinary human. Brock can withstand high caliber bullets, great impact forces, powerful energy blasts, and falls from great heights without sustaining physical injury. He is durable enough that he can withstand multiple barrages of high-caliber weapons such as machine guns from close range completely unperturbed,{{r|Venom Vs. Carnage #3}} and can withstand blows from superhuman beings such as Wrecker, Spider-Man, Carnage, etc unharmed. He also possesses an extreme resistance to pain, and seems to feel it only to a certain extent.{{r|Toxin #1}}
* '''Genetic Memory:''' The symbiote possesses some limited psychic ability, making it capable of obtaining information from its hosts and even other people and symbiotes simply by touch. It can, however, be forced to forget information if the symbiote is inflicted with heavy trauma.
* '''Offspring Detection:''' The symbiote is also capable of psychically detecting its offspring; however, with effort, this ability can be blocked.
* '''Spider-Sense:''' Brock is also granted an extrasensory ability similar to Spider-Man’s spider-sense. This response is not as complicated as Spider-Man’s inherent sense since the alien costume can detect danger from every direction and conduct Brock in plenty of time. It's a lot more efficient than Spider-Man’s spider-sense because it is more simplified to where the danger is.
* '''Spider-Sense Immunity:''' Due to Spider-Man being a host to the symbiote, Brock is able to bypass Spider-Man's spider-sense. As such, Brock is capable of attacking Spider-Man without alerting him, making him a deadly opponent.
* '''Constituent-Matter Generation:''' Toxin can also use the same substance comprising the symbiote in the form of constituent black matter or he can generate tentacle-like appendages from various parts of his body, which he often uses either in combat situations or to restrain someone.
* '''Shapeshifting:''' Toxin can manipulate his matter to enlarge or stretch his body in order to augment his attacks. He can morph sections of his body, such as his hands or feet, into spikes, blades, axes or a shield.
* '''Elasticity:''' Although it is wide known that the Symbiote can stretch and deform itself, recently it was able to perform this ability while being bonded with a human host.
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' He is capable of healing injuries in the host at a faster rate than normal human healing allows. The symbiote is even capable of healing injuries and illness that current human medical care cannot such as cancer and severe burns.{{r|Venom Vol 2 21}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 30}}
* '''Invisibility:''' The symbiote is capable of mimicking the appearance of any form of clothing, camouflaging with its surroundings, and even mimicking other people.
* '''Wall Crawling:''' Much like Spider-Man, Toxin has the ability to cling to virtually any surface. He can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slick/wet surfaces.
* '''Webbing Generation:''' Toxin can project a powerful, organic web-like substance similar to the webbing Spider-Man has. He typically uses this webbing to swing from building to building or as a means of immobilizing someone. The webbing is incredibly strong.
* '''Poisonous Fangs:''' An ability developed by Brock when he bonded with the symbiote. Toxin's fangs not only intimidate foes but deliver a powerful, toxic bite.{{r|Venom Vol 2 21}}
* '''Night Vision:''' Toxin can see in the dark.
* '''Superhuman Olfactory Senses:''' Toxin has a highly-developed sense of smell, and is able to track and identify targets through scent alone.{{r|Venom Vol 2 32}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 35}}

<big>'''Dreamstone'''</big>

'''Artificial Symbiotic Costume:''' After parting ways with the Venom symbiote, Eddie tricked one of Malekith's war witches into giving him a [[dreamstone]] - a dark elf artifact that can transform into whatever its user desires. The dreamstone initially manifested an artificial symbiote - influenced by Eddie's memories of and desire for the Venom symbiote, and replicated many of the Venom symbiote's powers and weaknesses.{{r|Venom Vol 4 13}} After being set ablaze by Jack O'Lantern, it reconfigured itself into a Venomized suit of Asgardian armor.{{r|Venom Vol 4 14}} Rather than let it corrupt him into a pawn of Malekith, Eddie relinquished it after defeating [[Jack O'Lantern (Impostor II) (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 15}}

<big>'''Codex-based Symbiote'''</big>

'''Black-and-White Symbiote Costume:''' After losing the Venom symbiote to Dark Carnage, Eddie smashed open a container holding various removed codices to create a new Venom. While still physically resembling Venom and possibly retaining his powers, this symbiote also grants Eddie Captain America's strategic mind, Hawkeye's keen vision, Wolverine's animalistic rage, and the Thing's incredible strength;{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 4}} as well as the ability to manifest draconic wings and a [[Glossary:Necrosword|Necrosword]].{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5}} However, the gestalt codex symbiote was absorbed into the Venom symbiote and these additional abilities eventually burnt out, returning Venom to his base power set.{{r|Venom Vol 4 20}}

<big>'''[[Glossary:Enigma Force|God of Light]]'''</big>

'''[[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]] Form:''' To stand against [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], Eddie was chosen as the host of the [[Glossary:Enigma Force|God of Light]], which resurrected him.{{r|Venom Vol 4 34}} Choosing the form of [[Venom]] with glowing eyes and spider emblems, and constellation-like markings, Eddie was able to easily overpower Knull, strip him of his [[Knull's Symbiote (Earth-616)|symbiote-armor]], and seemingly vanquish him once-and-for-all. After removing Knull's corruption from [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan Brock]], the God of Light left Eddie and the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]] rebonded to him.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 5}}
}}

| Abilities               = '''Expert Reporter:''' Before his bonding with the symbiote, Eddie Brock was an incredibly skilled reporter for the Daily Globe, and knew how to investigate. He also had many sources of information that aided him in helping with his plans.

'''Expert Marksman:''' Eddie is an expert marksman, as shown when he was hunting symbiotes{{r|Venom Vol 2 15}} and taking down Maniac's [[Inklings (Earth-616)|men]].{{r|Venom Vol 1 160}}

'''Skilled Hand-to-Hand Combatant:''' Although he's had no proper training, Eddie is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant when using symbiotes.

'''Skilled Symbiote Hunter:''' Even though he is only human, Eddie was been able to take on and defeat several symbiotes. This was shown when he killed Scream and Hybrid while using advanced and normal weaponry.{{r|Venom Vol 2 15}}
| Strength                = Class 70; Eddie Brock worked his body to the natural peak human level of a man of his height, age, weight and build exercise. He is able to lift no more than 700 lbs without any symbiotic suit.{{r|Spider-Man The Ultimate Guide #1}} The Venom symbiote has enabled Eddie to lift up to 70 tons in their regular size, but this is not their true limit as their strength increases with their variable muscle mass.

{{Navigation

| body  =
<big>'''Anti-Venom'''</big>

Class 50-70; As Anti-Venom, Eddie possessed superhuman strength enabling him to lift about 13-70 tons in his regular size.{{r|Spider-Man: Brand New Day Yearbook #1}}

<big>'''Toxin'''</big>

Class 100; When Eddie was infused with the Toxin symbiote, he was able to lift 60 to 90 tons when in a calm state. This base strength exponentially increases when he is angered or excited as his physical size and strength drastically increase enabling him to lift in excess 100 tons.
}}

| Weaknesses              = '''Mental Instability:''' Eddie has been repeatedly shown relapsing into his unstable "lethal protector" mindset. As both Anti-Venom and Toxin, he reverted back to this persona, killing criminals just as offhandedly as when he was Venom. He is also addicted to the power bestowed upon him by being bonded to a symbiote, which has caused drastic shifts in his personality.{{r|Venom Vol 2 34}}{{r|Carnage Vol 2 4}}{{r|Venom Vol 3 6}}

'''Sonic and Heat:''' The Venom symbiote, like all others of its kind, is extremely vulnerable to heat and sonic based attacks. They can cause the symbiote physical pain and discomfort, whereas "more powerful" attacks might be completely ineffective.

'''Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder:''' Eddie developed Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) following his encounters with [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 10}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Weaknesses
| body  = 
<big>'''Anti-Venom'''</big>

'''Osborn's Cure:''' As Anti-Venom, he can only be weakened by poisons that infect the body. The white symbiote takes the damage leaving Eddie powerless. Norman created the virus using [[Freak (Vagrant) (Earth-616)|Freak]]'s DNA.

'''Mister Negative's Powers:''' As Martin Li's [[Glossary:Lightforce|power]] was the source responsible for the creation of the Anti-Venom suit, the symbiote is vulnerable to Mister Negative's [[:Glossary:Darkforce|power]]. Similarly to Osborn's cure, it can weaken or nullify the suit's healing powers until Mister Negative's power is no longer directly in contact with it.

'''Antibody Overuse:''' If Anti-Venom overuses his healing powers, the symbiote becomes weakened and can potentially be overwhelmed and purged.{{r|Venom Vol 2 7}}

<big>'''Toxin'''</big>

'''Sonics and Heat:''' The Toxin symbiote, like all others of its kind, is extremely vulnerable to heat and sonic based attacks. They can cause the symbiote physical pain and discomfort, whereas "more powerful" attacks might be completely ineffective. However, the Toxin symbiote is more resilient to these attacks than most other members of its species.

<big>'''Venom'''</big>

'''Altered Metabolism:''' As a result of being exposed to high concentrations of symbiote-suppressant drugs while bonded to the Toxin symbiote and working for the FBI, Eddie's metabolism was altered to make his body inhospitable to symbiotes. This has exacerbated the Venom symbiote's psychological corruption and caused it to begin to lose physical cohesion.{{r|Venom Vol 1 152}} Eddie's altered metabolism was cured when he was doused in Alchemax's Anti-Venom serum by Spider-Man.{{r|Venom Vol 1 161}}

'''Anti-Venom:''' Flash Thompson's Anti-Venom suit is toxic to the Venom symbiote. Its touch is very painful to Venom and its host, and prolonged contact will eventually kill it.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 792}} However, the Anti-Venom replica died along with Flash Thompson when the Red Goblin murdered him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800}}

'''Knull:''' Knull, a dark god who created the symbiotes, is able to mentally influence and dominate them, including Venom, driving them insane with bloodlust and enslaving them to his will. If Eddie is wearing the symbiote while Knull is controlling it, he loses control over it.{{r|Venom Vol 4 1}} However, since Eddie himself has killed Knull and become the new King in Black, he is no longer susceptible to Knull's influence.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 5}}

| Notes                   = * Despite Venom made a oath to himself and fellow allies such as Spider-Man to never take a innocent life and remain a vigilante of justice, Eddie Brock broke this oath at least three times in the past: he murdered a young and innocent nurse by stabbing the woman several times with a knife in a fit of rage and despair when he was terminally ill with cancer,{{Citation}} nearly killed Aunt May when she was hospitalized but stopped after coming to his senses,{{Citation}} and also killed a police officer and maximum security prison guard by suffocating them with his symbiote suit.{{Citation}}<ref>[https://screenrant.com/venom-characters-people-killed-marvel-comics/ 15 People Venom Has Killed]</ref>
* Despite the common belief that Eddie did not indulge in cannibalism during his original tenure as Venom and that [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Mac Gargan]] was the first and only host to do so, there have been several incidents where Eddie engaged in cannibalism, alluded to having done so, seriously attempted to do so, or otherwise used his symbiotes' fanged jaws to kill or maim opponents in combat: 
** In {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 302}}, Venom bit off the head of an android body-double of [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]], believing it to be the real Tony. After being repelled by Iron Man, Venom voiced his intent to eat Tony if he didn't satisfactorily prove his innocence.
** Venom killed one of the [[Sunrise Society (Earth-616)|Sunrise Society]]'s High-Tech Ninja in {{cl|Venom: The Mace Vol 1 3}} by biting down on his head. 
** Venom attempted to eat the third [[Michael Engelschwert (Earth-616)|Sin-Eater]] in {{cl|Venom: Sinner Takes All Vol 1 3}}, stopping when he realized he was biting into a dummy.
** Venom ate a man's brain while under the influence of the Venom symbiote in {{cl|Venom: The Hunger Vol 1 1}}, after which Eddie was revolted by the symbiote's carnivorous appetite and stated that he'd never intended his frequent threats of cannibalism as anything more than a joke.
** After sustaining mild amnesia and relapsing into villainy, Venom declared his intent to actually carry through with his threats of cannibalism while fighting Spider-Man; ate a chunk of [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]], nearly killing Baker in the process; and attempted to eat Spider-Man before being driven off by a lighter in {{cl|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 16}}.
** Venom attempted to eat Spider-Man while under the influence of [[Kulan Gath (Impostor) (Earth-616)|Kulan Gath]] in {{cl|Spider-Man / Red Sonja Vol 1 2}}, using an attack resembling his "Venom Predate" Forward-Heavy move from the [[Marvel vs. Capcom (Series)|''Marvel vs. Capcom'' series]]. After breaking free of Gath's control, Venom attempted to eat the sorcerer and licked his blood off his claws after scratching him in {{cl|Spider-Man / Red Sonja Vol 1 3}}.
** While bonded to the [[Toxin (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Toxin symbiote]], Eddie bit off [[Gregory Nettles (Earth-616)|Megatak]]'s head in {{cl|Venom Vol 2 21}} and devoured two [[Symbiote Slayers|symbiote slayer]]-infected individuals in {{cl|Venom Vol 2 34}} and {{cl|Venom Vol 2 35}}.
** Both [[Cullen Bunn|Cullen Bunn]] and [[Mike Costa]] have implied in {{cl|Venom Vol 2 35}}, {{cl|Venom Vol 1 157}}, and {{cl|Venom Vol 1 158}} that Eddie had succumbed to the Venom symbiote's hunger off-panel on other occasions; with Costa having intended for Venom to eat people during his run but having been unable to fit it in beyond the symbiote desiring to devour people as its corruption worsened and attempting to do so while berserk.{{r|Venom Vol 1 155}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 158}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc.

** In ''[[Poison-X]]'', Eddie threatened to eat [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]]'s brain but was rebuked by the symbiote, which had been cleansed of its corruption. Later, Eddie attempted to eat [[Haze Mancer (Earth-616)|Haze Mancer]] but was ironically stopped by the symbiote and the [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|time-displaced X-Men]].{{r|Venom Vol 1 162}}
** In [[David Michelinie]]'s story for {{cl|Venom Vol 4 25}}, "Paradise Interrupted", Eddie references eating people to feed the symbiote and laments that the arms dealers' corpses - which he refers to as "fresh meat" - were buried when the island's mine collapsed.

| Trivia                  = * In the book ''[[Comic Creators on Spider-Man]]'', [[David Michelinie]] revealed that when creating a new character to be bonded to the symbiote, his original idea was for the villain to be a woman. Her origin would be that she was pregnant about to give birth, her husband tried to get a taxi in order to go to the hospital. However, the taxi driver was distracted by a sighting of Spider-Man and accidentally ran over the husband, killing him. This caused the woman to go into labour, losing her baby and her sanity. Eventually she would regain her sanity but have a deep hatred for Spider-Man, and the symbiote would bond to her in order to get revenge on Spider-Man - which is why the hands that shove Peter Parker in front of a train in {{cl|Web of Spider-Man #18}} and grabs his ankle in {{cl|Web of Spider-Man #24}} resemble a woman's. This idea, however, was rejected by [[Jim Salicrup|Jim Salicrup]], who stated that a woman wasn't threatening enough to make a serious super villain.
* Eddie Brock is the second human who most bonded to symbiotes, only surprased by Cletus Kasady. He's been bonded to [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom]], assimilated the [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|orignal Carnage symbiote]]{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 10}} and [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Mania]] through Venom,{{r|Venom Vol 1 18}} [[Anti-Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 569}} [[Toxin (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Toxin]],{{r|Venom Vol 2 17}} [[Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Tyrannosaurus]] merged with Venom,{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}} [[Sleeper (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Sleeper]],{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1 3}} [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Dark Carnage]],{{r|Venom Vol 4 24}} and [[Venom III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom/"Legion"]].{{r|{{cl|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 4}}-[[Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5|5]]}}
* Eddie believed that [[Miguel O'Hara (Earth-928)|Spider-Man 2099]] stole his costume design from him.{{r|Spider-Man 2099 Meets Spider-Man #1}}
* According to a 2021 interview with CBR, Venom's series of miniseries in the 1990s arose as a compromise between Marvel executives who disliked the character but wanted to capitalize on the character's runaway popularity as an antihero. Furthermore, according to Flavio Sette, Venom's reversion to villainy in the late 1990s and early 2000s was due the miniseries' decline in sales.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-maximum-carnage-influences/|title=Spider-Man: The Influences Behind the Creation of Maximum Carnage|work=CBR.com|first=Brian|last=Cronin|date=19 January 2021|accessdate=9 February 2021}}}} 
* During his [[Venom Vol 2|''Venom'']] run starring Flash Thompson, writer [[Cullen Bunn]] originally planned for Eddie Brock to take the [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|clone of the Venom symbiote]] with the [[Hell-Mark]], becoming a second hellish version of Venom. However, since Eddie was bonded to Toxin around that time and he decided they could stay together longer, Bunn decided to keep the plot point, but introduce [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Andi Benton]] to become the symbiote clone's host instead.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://cullenbunn.tumblr.com/post/66222227144/a-while-back-you-said-mania-ended-up-being-someone|title=Ending One 2nd @ a Time, A while back you said Mania ended up being someone...|work=Tumblr|first=Cullen|last=Bunn|date=11 June 2013|accessdate=15 June 2018}}}}
* In [[Rick Remender]] and [[Cullen Bunn|Cullen Bunn]]'s plans for their prospective "War of the Symbiotes" arc in ''Venom'' Vol. 3, Eddie Brock was planned to sacrifice himself to stop the Toxin symbiote when it went "into heat" and began producing countless spores that would result in a worldwide plague of symbiotes -- the "Spawning" event alluded to in [[Venom Vol 2|''Venom'' Volume 2]].{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/remender/status/1246864538726621187|title=Rick Remender on Twitter: "Digging back into the HD.

* For Eddie Brock's return as Venom starting with {{cl|Venom Vol 3 6}}, the character's exaggerated musculature and more monstrous features were toned down in favor of a look which called back to his earliest appearances. The monstrous aspects have instead been used thematically as a visual cue to reflect the symbiote's mental state.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/books/2017/07/14/marvel-legacy-spider-man-venom/|title=Marvel Legacy first look at Spider-Man, Venom|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Christian|last=Holub|date=14 July 2017|accessdate=14 July 2017}}}}
* Eddie is a fan of [[Francis Sinatra (Earth-616)|Frank Sinatra]]{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 363}} and [[Rolling Stones (Earth-616)|The Rolling Stones]].{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1 4}}
* Eddie was raised as a devout Catholic - disparaging the notion of gods aside from [[Yahweh (Earth-616)|the Abrahamic one]] as blasphemy and even developed a messiah complex after becoming [[Anti-Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom]].{{r|Venom: Dark Origin Vol 1 1}}{{r|Carnage Vol 2 8}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 7}} Feeling abandoned by God, Eddie eventually came to question his faith,{{r|Carnage Vol 2 15}} and eventually forsook it.{{r|Venom Vol 1 150}} However, Eddie is not a true atheist as he currently acknowledges the existence of gods such as [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] and [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 23}}{{r|Venom Vol 4 6}}
