| Quotation               = See, Cordyceps Jones...he's '''alien'''. He's not like you and me. You ever hear about that fungus that takes over ants? It starts out as a spore on the breeze...then it gets into an ant, and it lodges in his teeny tiny little '''brain'''. And it grows. And while it's growing, it makes Mr. Ant climb -- higher, right to the top of the nearest plant. Where the fungus can spore again. Doesn't end too well for the ant. And that Cordyceps. He's not a humanoid -- he's a '''spore'''. A fungus, taking over host bodies and making them climb, right to the top.
