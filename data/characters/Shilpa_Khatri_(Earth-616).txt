| History                 = Trinary was a young [[Homo superior|mutant]] from [[India]] who used her technopathic abilities to top up the accounts of every working Indian woman from the accounts of the twenty-five highest-earning CEOs in the country. Trinary's father reported her, and she was eventually caught and imprisoned by the [[Indian Mutant Defense Force (Earth-616)|Indian Mutant Defense Force]]. However, in anticipation for her capture, Trinary recorded a message asking [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] for help. The message reached its recipient in [[Wakanda]], resulting in Trinary's liberation from IMDF imprisonment by Jean Grey and her allies.{{r|X-Men: Red Vol 1 2}} Trinary took control of a [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] deployed by the IMDF and used it to escape with her rescuers. When they reached Wakanda, the mutant group was intercepted by [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], secretly under the influence of [[Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-616)|Cassandra Nova]].{{r|X-Men: Red Vol 1 3}} After Storm was incapacitated and the [[Nano-Sentinels|Sentinite]] controlling her was extracted from her brain with Trinary's help, Jean Grey decided to move her base of operations to [[Searebro]].{{Citation}}<!--

Trinary was among the mutants that formed Jean Grey's own [[X-Men (Jean Grey's) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] team to pursue the surfaced enemy.{{r|X-Men: Red Vol 1 4}} -->

===X-Men Disassembled===
Trinary was one of the many mutants that fought a crazed [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] from remaking the world in his image. When X-Man felt that the world would never be improved with the X-Men around, X-Man made all his enemies vanish, including Trinary.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9|10}} While most of the X-Men were sent to a different plane of existence ruled by X-Man, Trinary wasn't one of them. Where she was during his time is unknown.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}

===House of X===
Trinary eventually returned and was living on the sovereign nation-state of Krakoa for mutants, created by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]], [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], and [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira X]]. Moira and Charles Xavier tasked several technopath mutants such as [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]], [[Sage (Earth-616)|Sage]], and Trinary with creating a system called "Sleeping Giant" to monitor for Nimrod technological thresholds being reached and/or the attempted creation of a "[[Mother Mold (Earth-616)|Mother Mold]]", a replicating, adaptive Sentinel factory that was self-aware and capable of creating other Sentinels. Xavier and Magneto then tasked the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] with destroying the Mother Mold and preventing the creation of Nimrod. With the help of Jean Grey and [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet St. Croix]], Trinary coordinated the communication between team members and X-Men base in Krakoa. The X-Men accomplished their goal, but the entire team was killed in the attack{{r|House of X Vol 1 4}} thought later resurrected.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}

Trinary remained in Krakoa and aided [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] in tracking down the creators of the anti-Mutant website Dox.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 12}} Later, Monet St. Croix hired Trinary to be part of the board of the [[X-Corporation (Earth-616)|X-Corporation]].{{r|X-Corp Vol 1 1}}
