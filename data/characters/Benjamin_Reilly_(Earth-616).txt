| Overview                = '''Ben Reilly''' is a genetic clone of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]], the super hero Spider-Man, who went on to determine his own identity as the '''[[Scarlet Spider]]'''.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 52}} Ben was created by [[Miles Warren (Earth-616)|Miles Warren]], the super villain known as the Jackal, to torment the hero, and seemingly died in their first encounter.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 149}} The clone survived and exiled himself for five years, only returning to New York after learning that Parker's [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|Aunt May]] was sick. After making amends with Peter, Ben fought alongside him as the Scarlet Spider.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 52}} For a brief time, Ben and Peter were tricked by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] via [[Seward Trainer (Earth-616)|Seward Trainer]] to believe Ben was the real Peter Parker.

Ben was later brought back to life by Miles Warren using a new cloning method, and spent years being constantly killed and resurrected by his creator to improve on the cloning technology. Driven mad, Ben managed to escape and overthrow Warren, becoming the new '''[[Jackal]]'''.

===Spider-Man... or Spider-Clone?===
[[File:Peter Parker (Earth-616) vs. Peter Parker (Ben Reilly) (Earth-616).JPG|thumb|left|The first battle]]
Created from [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]]'s DNA by the [[Miles Warren (Earth-616)|Jackal]], this clone was made to fight him as part of Jackal's torment of Spider-Man, whom he blamed for [[Gwendolyne Stacy (Earth-616)|Gwen Stacy]]'s death. In the fight, only one could survive in order to save [[Edward Leeds (Earth-616)|Ned Leeds]] from a bomb. The Jackal activated the bomb, seemingly dying and killing the clone.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #149}} Spider-Man retrieved the "corpse" and buried him at a industrial chimney. The clone, however, was alive and managed to survive due to the Jackal injecting him with something earlier while he was unconscious. In an attempt to sow confusion between Peter Parker and the clone, the Jackal dumped [[Spider-Skeleton (Earth-616)|a different, already dead clone of Peter Parker]] down the same smoke stack Peter Parker dumped the living clone in after the Jackal had rescued him. After regaining consciousness, this clone witnessed Parker and [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane]] in an embrace, and concluded that he must be the clone as the clone's feelings wouldn't have developed to the point where he could emotionally accept his feelings for Mary Jane.

===Exiled===
The clone spent the next five years in exile from [[New York (State)|New York]], believing himself to be a worthless clone. He dubbed himself "Ben Reilly", using his [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|Uncle Ben]]'s first name and his [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|Aunt May]]'s maiden name.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #223}} After a period where he was stricken by influenza, he met scientist [[Seward Trainer (Earth-616)|Seward Trainer]], who inspired him with confidence to be his own person. Trainer also helped Ben by providing him with fake references to find work. Seward's references and Ben's own skills would allow him to work for a month or so at a time until people learned that his credentials were fake, forcing Ben to move on. Although he attempted to avoid attracting attention to himself, Reilly was unable to simply hide when his spider-sense went off, resulting in him helping the local police deal with various gangs during a stop-over in [[Salt Lake City]]. During his time there, Reilly found love with college student/waitress Janine Godbe, but she later revealed that her true identity as [[Elizabeth Tyne (Earth-616)|Elizabeth Tyne]], a fugitive who killed her father after enduring his repeating incestuous abuse. Although Ben spent some time living with Janine, she apparently committed suicide out of guilt at her past crimes, leaving Reilly to be constantly followed by [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]], who vowed to deny Reilly happiness for as long as he could.

During this particularly bleak time, Ben began working as a janitor in a [[Portland]] high school using the alias "Henry Jones", initially allowing himself to be regarded as mentally handicapped until he rescued a woman from home invaders, which helped him realize that he could still make a difference. Following this, he lived for a short time in [[Italy]], where he worked as an English teacher, but he was forced to leave after a Mafia boss discovered Reilly's past after his daughter expressed an interest in Reilly. The Mafioso learned about the gaps in Reilly's work record and forced him to leave the city.

===Scarlet Spider===
Returning to New York when he found out about Aunt May's failing health, Ben came face-to-face with Peter and had to explain his reasons for returning. His presence also inspired Peter to get through his current dark mood after recent tragedies.{{r|Web of Spider-Man #117}}

[[File:‏‎Ben Reilly (Earth-616) from Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 118 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]
After an initial distrust of each other, Peter and Ben became friends and worked side by side as Spider-Man and the Scarlet Spider it was revealed by Seward Trainer that Peter was the clone and Ben had been the real Peter Parker all along. This drove Peter almost insane and left Ben stunned. They agreed to keep their names, since Ben still didn't feel like he deserved the name. Peter soon gave up the webs when he found out that Mary Jane was pregnant, leaving Ben as New York's only web-slinger.

While Peter Parker was on trial for a murder he didn't commit, Ben Reilly took Peter's spot in prison; giving Peter the mantle of Scarlet Spider, while the police figured out how to prove Peter Parker innocent. It was later revealed Kaine had committed the murder and due to being a clone, they thought it was Peter's fingerprint on the skeleton.

With Peter and Mary Jane leaving New York to lead a more quiet life in Portland, Peter offered Ben his Spider-Man suit. Ben, having turned down Peter's original costume,{{r|Web of Spider-Man #128}} continued to operate as the Scarlet Spider, and joined the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]],{{r|New Warriors #62}} though none of the team members fully accepted him because he refused to reveal his identity. After Peter and Mary Jane moved away however, he took over the role of Spider-Man.

He soon quit the New Warriors after [[Carolyn Trainer (Earth-616)|Lady Octopus]] and [[Alistaire Smythe (Earth-616)|Alistaire Smythe]] ruined his reputation using a holographic copy. Reilly concluded that the deception had worked because he was too new to the group for them to trust him.{{r|Web of Scarlet Spider #4}}

===As Spider-Man===
[[File:Ben Reilly (Earth-616) from Sensational Spider-Man Vol 1 0 0001.png|thumb|left|Ben Reilly as Spider-Man]]
Although most people accepted that the 'new' Spider-Man was the same person as the old one, various heroes and villains learned the truth, including [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]], [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]], [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Firestar]], [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]], [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]], the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]], [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]], [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]], [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].

Having become Spider-Man, Ben began to enjoy the chance to have his own adventures, working as a waiter at local coffee house the [[Daily Grind]], dying his hair blonde to distinguish himself from Peter, and dating local university students [[Jessica Carradine (Earth-616)|Jessica Carradine]] (until it was revealed that she was the daughter of the [[Burglar (Earth-616)|burglar]] who killed Uncle Ben) and [[Desiree Winthrop (Earth-616)|Desiree Winthrop]].

During Christmas, New York had been enthralled by a new channel: Mystery-Vision; save for some lucky individuals.{{r|Sensational Spider-Man #1}} It was discovered that it was [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]], who had discovered a chip that would create 3-D images instantly, without the use of an entire crew, manipulating it to become attractive to the human gaze. Ben defeated him and put a stop to his plans.{{r|Spider-Man #65}}

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man The Complete Ben Reilly Epic Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|As Spider-Carnage]]
Peter Parker and Mary Jane then returned to New York, due to missing it. Peter got a job at the Daily Bugle, using Ben's predicament as Spider-Man as a way of getting good cash.

When the [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage symbiote]] escaped [[Ravencroft Institute|Ravencroft]],{{r|Sensational Spider-Man #3}} Ben Reilly bonded with it to stop it harming anyone else,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #410}} managing to keep himself under control long enough for [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]] to drive it out with a potentially fatal blast of microwave radiation, forcing it to return to [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Kasady]].{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #233}} Soon after this confrontation, Seward Trainer disappeared as Peter was trying to research his background, and Ben was framed for arson when the Grind was burned down. It was later revealed that it was actually the new [[Jason Macendale Jr. (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]] that was hired to burn down the diner.{{r|Spider-Man #69}}

Ben Reilly's old girlfriend, [[Elizabeth Tyne (Earth-616)|Janine]], eventually found him in back in New York, seemingly out of nowhere. After a short while of bliss, Kaine had come back and seemingly killed Janine. In anger, Ben chases him down only to get drugged and was sent into a hellish trip. [[File:Ben Reilly (Earth-616) from Spider-Man Vol 1 75 001.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Ben Reilly is killed... for the time being]]Kaine then reveals that Janine was also drugged to appear dead and after a long anguish filled battle, Ben convinced Kaine to stop attacking them; and give himself in. Following Kaine's footsteps, Janine turns herself in; claiming that she was done running and wanted Ben to finally be happy.{{r|Spider-Man: Redemption Vol 1}}

During the [[Onslaught (Event)|Onslaught event]], Sentinels invaded the city,{{r|Sensational Spider-Man #8}} which Ben and Peter helped fight off before the other heroes were sent to [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]]' [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Pocket Dimension]].

Eventually, it was revealed that Trainer was working for [[Mendel Stromm (Earth-616)|Gaunt]] and [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]. Norman had survived the glider to his chest all those years ago and created the whole clone saga in order to drive Peter mad.

During a confrontation between the Green Goblin and the two Spider-Men, Norman impaled Ben Reilly with his glider and Peter watched as he seemingly disintegrated, proving that Ben was the clone all along. Peter dispersed Ben's ashes across New York City from a rooftop.{{r|Spider-Man #75}}

===Ghosts of the Past===
Years later, Peter was attacked by a man named [[Damon Ryder (Earth-616)|Damon Ryder]] (using the name Raptor), believing him to be Ben Reilly. Raptor showed Spider-Man a sketch of the arsonist and revealed that the arsonist looked like Peter and Ben.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #36}}

Ryder then appeared in New York City and confronted Peter, still believing him to be Ben Reilly and repeatedly calling him "Ben". The two fought in the middle of the office of [[Daily Bugle (Front Line) (Earth-616)|Front Line]] after Raptor threatened to target Peter's family. Ryder gained the upper hand before Peter's coworkers got in the way, then left after handing over the article on the arsonist, with [[Benjamin Urich (Earth-616)|Ben Urich]] noting that it appeared to be Peter in the sketch. Ryder ditched his jacket not knowing a spider-tracer was on it, and headed to Peter's apartment to seemingly attack his roommate. When Spider-Man reached the tagged jacket, he was attacked by Kaine.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #608}} After a scuffle with Kaine, Peter returned to his apartment and found his roommate unharmed, though she gave him the address of Aunt May's home. Peter headed there, only to find Raptor holding [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Harry Osborn]] and his cousins hostage at gunpoint. As Raptor announced his plans to burn his friends and family to death right in front of him after he admitted his "true identity" as Ben Reilly, Kaine arrived, revealing that he had been working with Raptor. Kaine exposed both Peter's identity and his status as a "clone" of Reilly to Raptor, encouraging him to kill him, since if Reilly was a murderer, then Peter could be driven to kill as well. Refusing to accept this, Peter beat Raptor unconscious, while affirming his and Reilly's innocence and the fact that they would never murder anyone. He was forced to flee when the police arrived, which allowed Kaine and Raptor to escape.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #609|610}}

===Dead No More===
Ben Reilly was brought back to life by Miles Warren through a new cloning procedure he devised that allowed his subjects to retain old memories, in the case of Ben, to the point of his death. As the procedure caused the clones to suffer from cellular degradation, Reilly was constantly killed and resurrected by Warren in an attempt to find a cure for it. Reilly managed to break free from the shackles used to restrain him and attacked Warren, almost killing him. However, at the last second, Reilly realized there were other ways to deal with Warren and decided to knock him unconscious instead and cloned him. Tricking Warren into thinking he was a clone, Reilly convinced him and [[Miles Warren Clones (Earth-616)|his clones]] to work for him in return for [[New U Pills|the pills]] he created to keep the cellular degeneration at bay. Ben took on the identity of the Jackal, impersonating the real Miles Warren, and created [[New U Technologies (Earth-616)|New U Technologies]] with the intention to use Warren's new cloning technology for good.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 22}}

[[File:Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 2 Bagley Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|As the Jackal]]
As the Jackal, Ben started laying a network of influence across the United States, using New U's cloning procedure to bring back to life the loved ones of members of government, law enforcement agencies, medical institutions, and even the media.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 3}} At one point, Ben also resurrected [[Gwendolyne Stacy (Earth-616)|Gwen Stacy]], offering her a place in his circle because he couldn't "trust himself with this." At first, she wasn't enthusiastic about it until she encountered her father, [[George Stacy (Earth-616)|George Stacy]], whom Ben had resurrected earlier, which convinced her to join.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 1}}

In order to strengthen his enterprise, the Jackal recruited numerous of Spider-Man's foes, including the [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 2}} the [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Lizard]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 4}} and a depowered [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 10}} He also attempted to approach the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]], who refused, claiming the Jackal had tainted the memory of his dead wife [[Vanessa Fisk (Earth-616)|Vanessa]], whom Ben had brought back to provide Fisk with an incentive.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 19}}

Ben eventually had New U come to light, appearing in the world as a pharmaceutical company which provided high-end medical solutions using cloned organs. As part of Ben's plan to slowly convince Peter Parker to join his enterprise, he had New U doctor [[Rita Clarkson (Earth-616)|Rita Clarkson]] enter in contact with Peter Parker to offer him to save the life of his step-uncle [[John Jonah Jameson, Sr. (Earth-616)|Jay Jameson]]. Peter was initially reluctant, but ended up paying for New U's services, albeit for another patient, an employee of his named [[Jerome Salteres (Earth-616)|Jerry Salters]] who had suffered a near-fatal accident while working at [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]] and had but hours left to live.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 16}} However, when [[Jerome Salteres (Clone) (Earth-616)|the "cured" Jerry Salteres]] triggered his spider-sense, Peter became suspicious of New U, and had his ally the [[Hobie Brown (Earth-616)|Prowler]] investigate their [[New U Headquarters|base of operations]] at [[San Francisco]].

The Prowler arrived at New U's base when the Jackal attempted to submit Electro to a procedure that would restore his powers, but ended up powering up his lover [[Francine Frye (Earth-616)|Francine Frye]] instead, who Reilly had resurrected in order to make Dillon cooperate. The Prowler was accidentally killed by Frye when he was discovered snooping around, but Ben made a [[Hobie Brown (Clone) (Earth-616)|clone]] of him and convinced him to join his cause.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 17}}{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 5}}

The Jackal later brought back to life the late wife of [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|John Jonah Jameson]] to use his [[Fact Channel News (Earth-616)|news chain]] for publicity,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 16}} as well as countless of friends and foes of Spider-Man.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 1}} Through the machinations of [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|a duplicate of Doctor Octopus]], Ben also acquired the corpse of [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|the original Doc Ock]]. The duplicate agreed to work for Ben once he took control of his new cloned body.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 20}}

[[File:New U Technologies (Earth-616) from Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Presenting Spider-Man New U's clones]]
After Jerry Salteres mysteriously disappeared, having being taken by New U after suffering from cellular degeneration when he forgot to take his pills, Spider-Man personally investigated New U. When he infiltrated their base of operations, Peter was confronted by the Jackal,{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 1}} along with all of the villains who had been resurrected by him, Gwen and Captain Stacy. Ben offered Peter a chance to join him, in order to use the combined power of New U and Parker Industries to help the world, but Peter turned him down. When Gwen Stacy was outed as an impostor, with the original having being replaced by [[Gwendolyn Stacy (Earth-65)|her superpowered counterpart]] from [[Earth-65|an alternate universe]] who had been investigating the Jackal's operations, Peter found the chance to escape with her.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 2}}

Eluding capture from other villains, Ben caught up with Peter, who overpowered him easily. Finally, Ben unmasked and revealed his identity to Peter. He made his offer again to Peter, this time offering up the chance to bring back [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|Uncle Ben]] as an incentive.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 3}} After hearing Ben's story of his resurrection,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 22}} Peter accompanied him to [[Transamerica Pyramid|his secondary base of operations]], seemingly giving Ben a chance.

[[File:Ben Reilly (Earth-616) from Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 3 001.png|thumb|right|Ben reveals himself to Peter]]
Once there, Ben showed Peter the apparent utopia he had built, a place where Spider-Man's friends and foes coexisted peacefully. Having realized that Ben possessed power but not responsibility, Peter reprimanded him, prompting Ben to order the villains he had brought back to attack him. Reilly returned to the lab, where Doc Ock and Ben's hostage [[Anna Maria Marconi (Earth-616)|Anna Maria Marconi]] had discovered it was a specific type of frequency which caused the cellular decay, and an inverse frequency could stop the decay altogether.

Doc Ock amplified the frequency responsible for the decay and piped it throughout the base after discovering that the Jackal was a clone, having decided to sabotage his enterprise for having disrespected Anna Maria, whom Otto loved. When all the clones in the base began to break down and turn into [[Carrion|Carrions]], Ben decided to broadcast the decaying signal across the entire world, causing an outbreak of the [[Carrion Virus]] globally, with the intention to bring every single person back as a clone once they had died.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 4}}

Ben kept fighting Doctor Octopus while Spider-Man hacked into the emergency system of his [[Webware]] and had all of these devices globally emit the inverse frequency, stopping the outbreak and curing all those who hadn't yet completely broken down. During their fight, Octavius shattered Ben's Webware, preventing both of them from being cured.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 5}} Ben then attempted to transfer his mind to a prototype body of New U's ultimate clone template created by Octavius. However, Octavius was already expecting Ben to do so and set a trap on the mind-transferring device that rendered Ben unconscious.

When Ben woke up, the proto-clone was gone and Doc Ock's old body was dissolved, suggesting that Octavius was able to transfer his mind to the clone before his body broke down and fled. After using the dissolved remains of a Miles Warren clone to make it seem he had perished, Ben escaped the building and stole a Webware to stabilize his own body.

Arriving at his safe house, which had been built by the Miles Warren clones to resemble Aunt May's house, Ben was confronted by the real Miles Warren in his original Jackal costume, bent on getting revenge on Reilly for stripping him of his identity. The Jackal started a fire to burn what was left of New U's resources and attacked Ben, but was ultimately defeated and buried under the wreckage of the burning house. After leaving the Jackal to die (metaphorically and literally), Ben set out to pave a new future for himself.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 24}}

===Life in Las Vegas===
Ben relocated to [[Las Vegas]] in an attempt to begin a new life, returning to mantle of Scarlet Spider in the process. Ben's past still haunted him, seemingly in the form of Dissociative Identity Disorder, which caused Ben to hallucinate with his past alter-egos.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 1}} Not long after that, Reilly was forced into an alliance with one of his former clients from New U, influential businesswoman [[Cassandra Mercury (Earth-616)|Cassandra Mercury]], whose terminally-ill daughter [[Abigail Mercury (Earth-616)|Abigail]] had been one of the many people replaced with healthy clones by the Jackal. Reilly reluctantly agreed to investigate Abigail's disease and find a cure for her condition.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 2}} On Ben's trail was Kaine, who wanted to kill Reilly for his actions as the Jackal.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 3}} Once both Scarlet Spiders came face to face,{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 4}} Kaine agreed to let Ben go until Abigail was cured.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 5}}

[[File:Ben Reilly Scarlet Spider Vol 1 20 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Return of the Scarlet Spider]]

In an unusual turn of events, Ben was confronted by the personification of [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]] itself, who had become fixated on Reilly due to the many times he had died and come back to life. Death warned Ben that his many passings through the afterlife had corrupted his soul, though it would eventually heal in due time to the point he could return to being the hero he once was; however, one more death and resurrection would forever contaminate his soul. As a parting gift, Death offered to bring either Kaine, who had been killed by Death when he tried to attack Ben, or Abigail, who had died of her injuries, back to life, prompting Ben to offer his own life in order to save theirs. Amused, Death not only resurrected Kaine and Abigail but healed the scars in Ben's face too.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 7}} In the middle of continuing his research on Abby's disease, the Scarlet Spider came into conflict with [[Silas Burr (Earth-616)|Hornet]], who had seemingly returned from the dead.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 8}} Although he learned that his restoration by Death came at the price of regaining his scars if he compromised his heroism,{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 11}} Reilly collected himself to confront the newly-reformed Slingers and their accusation of his recent beating of a man responsible for stealing food from the Mercury Casino. Learning that the Hornet was actually Cyber and the Black Marvel a demon,{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 12}} Reilly worked alongside Kaine and the Slingers to exorcise the demon. The Slingers accepted Reilly's apology for the earlier beating, recognizing that there were shades of grey.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 13}} On the advice of [[Cassie St. Commons (Earth-616)|Dusk]], Reilly investigated reports of [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Quentin Beck]] in Las Vegas, but departed satisfied at Beck's story that he had decided to retire after his recent experiences, since that reminded Ben that he came to Las Vegas for the same reason as Quentin: having a second chance.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 14}}

Ben became entangled in a demonic conflict that erupted in Las Vegas, since the mysterious [[Diogenes Initiative (Earth-616)|Diogenes Initiative]] coerced him into assisting the [[Midnight Sons (Earth-616)|Midnight Sons]] stop [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]]'s attempt in taking the souls of the residents of the city.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 15}} During the conflict, Mephisto approached Ben offered him to save Abigail's life and purify his soul in exchange for helping him stop the Midnight Sons.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 16}} Ben accepted the offer, but ultimately went back on his word.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 17}}

[[File:Ben Reilly Scarlet Spider Vol 1 25 Textless.jpg|thumb|Ben is resurrected once again]]

Continuing his search for a cure for Abigail's disease, Ben crossed paths with the Diogenes Initiative again and met its leader, the [[Angels (Monotheism)|Angel]] [[Gabriel (Angel) (Earth-616)|Gabriel]]. Gabriel gave Ben a vial containing his own blood to cure Abigail.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 22}} However, when Ben was about to inject the cure on Abigail on her deathbed, a lesser demon posing as Mephisto{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 9 5}} acted on Ben's defiance. It created created a complex deception that stopped Ben from saving Abigail, falling under the belief that the cure would condemn her to an immortal existence at her current age, and subsequently altered Kaine and Cassandra's memories so that they would try to kill Ben; believing that Ben willingly withheld the cure for his own profit. After learning of the Mephisto-lookalike's deception, Ben injected the cure on Abigail, but since she had passed away it didn't have an immediate effect.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 23}} Although Ben was killed by Kaine just as the hour ran out,{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 24}} his spirit was saved by Abigail's as she ascended to an spiritual level of existence because of his cure. Abigail rewarded Ben for all of his sacrifices by offering to give him his life back. Ben refused, recalling Death's words that his soul would be shattered if he came back to life once again, nevertheless, Abigail revived him. Initially fearing the consequences of Death's warning, Ben quickly discovered that he had been driven sociopathic due to the damage to his soul, and he enjoyed it. Afterwards, Ben assaulted Kaine and fatally injured him, threatening him to leave Las Vegas if he survived. However, after he left, he soon broke down in an alleyway, crying.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 25}}

===[[Spider-Geddon]]===
[[File:Spider-Geddon Vol 1 4 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Ben being "sacrificed" by Otto Octavius]]
When the [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Superior Octopus]] approached Kaine and revealed that the [[Inheritors (Earth-001)|Inheritors]] had used New U's cloning technology to escape their prison, Ben followed them and volunteered his services - wanting to take responsibility for his villainous actions. Otto initially refused, still holding a grudge over Ben's deception as the Jackal, but Ben explained that having been killed and resurrected so many times had driven him insane and that he was trying to redeem himself - something that Otto should be able to identify with.{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 2|3}} Otto begrudgingly allowed Ben to join the team, but after [[Norman Osborn (Earth-44145)|Spider-Nor-Man]] and [[Spiders-Man (Earth-11580)|Spiders-Man]] sundered Earth-616's connection to the [[Web of Life and Destiny]] he betrayed Ben - giving him to the Inheritors in exchange for the other Spiders being left alone.{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 4}} Jennix consumed Ben, but was driven insane by being forced to relive the memories of his 27 deaths and resurrections. Ben was resurrected a 28th time by Otto, who revealed he and Ben had planned for this to happen; and Ben stated it had given him a clean slate. Not only his scars disappeared, but apparently this last death/resurrection has made him sane again, as he declared it has put him "back to factory settings". After the Inheritors were defeated, Ben, like the rest of the Spider-Army, returned home.{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 5}}

Ben returned to Las Vegas where he fought [[Conan (Earth-616)|Conan]] and [[Nyla Skin (Earth-616)|Nyla Skin]], thinking they were bad guys, but they were able to knock him out.{{r|Conan: Battle for the Serpent Crown Vol 1 2}}

===Books of Korvac===
At some point, Ben returned to New York, taking on a part-time job as a night shift security guard for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. During this period of time, Ben, along with [[Isaac Christians (Earth-616)|Gargoyle]], [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]], and [[Eugene Patilio (Earth-616)|Frog Man]] were recruited by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and [[Halcyon (Earth-616)|Halcyon]] to aid in their mission of finding and defeating the resurgent [[Michael Korvac (Earth-691)|Korvac]]. Ben and the others went to an [[Overstock Warehouse]] in hopes to find Korvac but they were instead lured to a trap where the ship they were on exploded, though they were saved by Gargoyle projecting an energy dome around them.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 5}} When questioned about why didn't he use his spider-sense, Ben said that he assumed his spider-sense was going off because they were about to run into Korvac's acolytes.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 6}} The team then joined Iron Man in continuing to pursue Korvac into outer space. Once they got close to Korvac's vessel, Tony went missing and Korvac decided to open fire on them.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 7}} Iron Man's ship flew through space with Korvac's vessel on its trail firing energy blasts at it. Inside the cockpit, [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] told the Scarlet Spider via the comms to lay down more cover fire and the team later managed to escape from the attack thanks to [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 8}}

All the heroes then decided to go into [[Worldship (Taa II)|Taa II]] by themselves instead of waiting for Tony, Once there, the heroes discovered that Tony somehow managed to get there and they all fought off Korvac's agents.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 12}} Ben was attacked by the [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] who was being controlled by a Controller Disc and the heroes eventually witnessed how both Korvac and Tony reached into the Power Cosmic.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 13}}

===Beyond Corporation===
[[File:Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616) from Free Comic Book Day 2021 Spider-Man Venom Vol 1 1 001.jpg |thumb|right|Ben returns as the new Spider-Man]]
Ben eventually was contacted by the [[Beyond Corporation (Multiverse)|Beyond Corporation]] to become Spider-Man once again and use a new suit made of impact-thickening, foam-based polymers. While hesitant at first, Ben decided to give the suit a test drive in [[Dallas]], [[Texas (State)|Texas]], where [[Carl Burbank (Earth-616)|Bushwacker]] was attacking a building. After beating Bushwacker, Ben returned to the base of the Beyond Corporation and explained his concern of being mistaken for the [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|other Spider-Man]], to which one of the members of the corporation responded that as far as the Beyond Corporation was concerned, Ben was the real Spider-Man going forward.{{r|Free Comic Book Day 2021: Spider-Man/Venom Vol 1 1}}

The Beyond Corporation also agreed to release his old girlfriend, [[Elizabeth Tyne (Earth-616)|Janine Godbe]], from the Bedford Falls Correctional Facility. Ben reunited with Janine after she got out and the two went home, ignoring that this was just a means for Beyond Corp to hold onto Ben's loyalty as their corporate Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 74}} He later went to recruit [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]] so that they could train him in the Beyond Facility.

Ben eventually met up with Peter and told him about how he was the new Spider-Man of the Beyond Corporation as they had bought the Spider-Man trademark from [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]] and he took up the mantle without his blessing. The [[Empire State University]] was later attacked by the [[U-Foes (Earth-616)|U-Foes]] and Ben sprang into action, with Peter joining in later to the fight during which both Spider-Men recieved large amounts of poisonous gas and radioactive blasts. While Ben's high-tech suit protected him, Peter was exposed to the ionizing radiation, which poisoned him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 75}} Ben quickly took Peter to the McCarthy Medical Center and called both [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|Aunt May]] and [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|MJ]] while posing as Peter before leaving. After arriving at the [[Beyond Tower]], Ben started to worry about Peter's condition and went back to the medical center in order to talk to him. At the medical center Ben received Peter's blessing to be Spider-Man as he deserves it, Ben thanked Peter and went after the U-Foes.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 76}}

After training with Misty Knight and Colleen Wing Ben had a talk with [[Maxine Danger (Earth-616)|Maxine Danger]] before going to his therapy session with Dr. [[Ashley Kafka (Earth-616)|Ashley Kafka]] where he tried to recall a memory with his [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|Uncle]] but couldn't remember what he said. Ben then visited Janine before going to another mission where he encountered [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]], Ben fought the Living Vampire but was quickly bitten by him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 77}}

| Powers                  = As a clone of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], Ben possesses the same powers he does.
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' The Scarlet Spider possesses the proportionate strength of a spider, granting him superhuman strength. He is capable of lifting 10 tons or more when under extreme stress. The Scarlet Spider's strength extends into his powerful leg muscles which allows him to leap heights and distances far beyond human capability.
* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' The Scarlet Spider is able to exert himself at peak capacity for several hours before fatigue begins to impair his performance.
* '''Superhuman Speed:''' The Scarlet Spider is capable of running and moving at speeds that are far beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete. Scarlet Spider has shown to be fast enough to catch up to an accelerating car while on foot, but preferred to travel by webs.
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' The composition of the Scarlet Spider's skeleton, inter-connected tissues, and nervous system had all been enhanced. His bodily tissues are somewhat more durable and resistant to impact or trauma than an ordinary human, although he is certainly not invulnerable. While his body is tougher than an ordinary human, he can still be injured in ways comparable to an ordinary human. He is seemingly killed when impaled in the back by the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]]'s goblin glider. He was able to catch a bullet at close range in his hand, although the act was very painful.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 5}}
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' If injured, his body is capable of regenerating faster than an ordinary human being is capable of.
* '''Superhuman Agility:''' The Scarlet Spider is extraordinarily limber and his tendons and connective tissues are twice as elastic as the average human being's, despite their enhanced strength.
* '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' The Scarlet Spider's [[reflexes]] are faster than an average human by about a factor of 40 (he his often able to dodge bullets only inches from hitting him). His practical reaction time is at least a dozen times that of a normal human. In combination with his spider-sense, the speed of his reflexes allowed him to dodge almost any attack, even bullets only inches away from his face.
* '''Superhuman Equilibrium:''' The Scarlet Spider possesses the ability to achieve a state of perfect equilibrium in any position imaginable. He seems able to adjust his position by instinct, which enables him to balance himself on virtually any object, no matter how small or narrow. He had developed a unique fighting style that made full use of his agility, strength, and equilibrium.
* '''Spider-Sense:''' The Scarlet Spider possesses an extrasensory "danger" or "spider" sense which warns him of potential immediate danger by the manifestation of a tingling sensation in the back of his skull, and links with his superhuman kinesthetics, which enable him to evade most any injuries, unless he cognitively overrides his automatic reflexes. The precise nature of this sense is unknown. It appears to be a simultaneous clairvoyant response to a wide variety of phenomena (everything from falling safes to speeding bullets to thrown punches), which has given several hundredths of a second warning, which is sufficient time for his reflexes to allow him to avoid injury. The sense also can create a general response on the order of several minutes: he can not discern the nature of the threat by the sensation. He can, however, discern the severity of the danger by the strength of his response to it. The Scarlet Spider's spider-sense is directional and could guide him to or away from hidden weapons and enemies. Sudden and extreme threats can cause his spider-sense to react with painful intensity. The Scarlet Spider can also sense and dodge attacks directed randomly or by a computer. Using his spider-sense to time his enhanced reflexes, the Scarlet Spider can casually dodge attacks up to and including automatic-weapons fire, provided there is sufficient distance. His spider-sense is sufficiently well-linked to his reflexes to the point that a threat could trigger them even when the Scarlet Spider is asleep or stunned. His spider-sense has helped him preserve his secret identity since it alerts him to observers or camera when changing into or out of his costume. The spider-sense does react to those who Ben does not consider to be a threat, such as Aunt May. The Scarlet Spider can choose to ignore his spider-sense, and distraction or fatigue diminish its effectiveness. The Scarlet Spider's fighting style incorporates the advantage that his "spider-sense" provides him. An interesting side-note was that, because Ben was not the host of the [[Venom]] Symbiote and was cloned before the Symbiote was bonded to Peter, his spider-sense did not see the Venom symbiote as himself, and Venom therefore triggered his spider-sense.
* '''Wall-Crawling:''' The Scarlet Spider possesses the ability to mentally control the flux of interatomic attraction (electrostatic force) between molecular boundary layers. This overcomes the outer electron shell's normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail. The mentally controlled sub-atomic particle responsible for this has yet to be identified. This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to the Scarlet Spider's body (especially concentrated in his hands and feet) and another object, with an upper limit of several tons per finger. Limits to this ability seem to be psychosomatic, and the full nature of this ability has yet to be established.

{{Navigation
| title = Former Powers	
| body  = Ben received a few new powers when he bonded with Carnage symbiote. Mostly, he didn't use these powers.
* '''Enhanced Superhuman Strength:''' Originally able to lift 10 tons, after merged with symbiote, he could lift about 80 tons.
* '''Camouflage Capabilities:''' The symbiote possessed limited shape-shifting abilities in the sense that it was able to immediately change itself to appear as any type of clothing or garment.
* '''Constituent Matter Generation:''' Ben was able to generate tentacle-like appendages from various parts of his body.
* '''Constituent-Matter Manipulation:''' With symbiote, Ben was able to morph sections of his body, such as his hands or feet, into bladed weaponry such as spikes, blades, or axes. He could also detach this bladed weaponry if he chose to.

| body  = '''Pill Dependency:''' Originally, Ben Reilly was most perfect & successful clone of Peter Parker that created by Jackal since he didn't suffered the cellular degradation like other clones. However, after being brought back to life through Miles Warren's new and experimental cloning procedure, Reilly's body suffered from cellular degradation, requiring him to ingest [[New U Pills|a pill]] he created daily in order to keep it at bay. Currently, this weakness no longer exists due to him being cured by [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]], making him a perfect clone again.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 7}}

'''Mental Illness:''' Recently, Ben has been experiencing hallucinations of his "Scarlet Spider" and "Jackal" personas as a result of the trauma he suffered from Miles Warren's experiments. The Scarlet Spider persona encourages Ben to make moral decisions while the Jackal persona urges him to be more selfish and apathetic.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 1}}

| Equipment               = 
| Transportation          = 
| Weapons                 = '''[[Web-Shooters]]:''' Ben originally had web-shooters that were duplicates of Peter's. After his first encounter with Venom, Ben redesigned his web-shooters to use twisting wrist motions as opposed to Peter's double tap. He also added the following to his arsenal:
* '''Impact Webbing:''' Web pellets that, upon impact (hence the name), release tendrils that ensnare the target.
* '''Stingers:''' Metal darts with a paralytic element that is used to temporarily incapacitate foes.

| Notes                   = * Between his first appearance and the Clone Saga, modern science seemed to conclude that cloning wasn't possible. {{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 8}} and {{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 149}} attempted to address this revelation by having the High Evolutionary determine the Jackal's clones of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy weren't clones at all, but individuals who were exposed to a recombinant-DNA virus that altered them into exact doubles. The Spider-Man Clone was therefore "really" a man named [[Anthony Serba (Earth-616)|Anthony Serba]], under the influence of the RNA virus. When the second Clone Saga brought back the clones (and medical science swung back to believing cloning was possible), {{cl|Scarlet Spider Unlimited Vol 1 1}} just had the High Evolutionary admit he lied, and Ben Reilly was a clone, not Anthony Serba.
* Ben claimed that he has found a cure for degradation cellular in the form [[New U Pills]]. They apparently prevent the cloned bodies from breaking down as a consequence of a flaw in their cloning process, and need to be ingested daily since the effect of these pills isn't permanent. Ben himself suffered from the same cellular degeneration as the other clones recently resurrected by [[New U Technologies (Earth-616)|New U]].
* ''[[Spider-Geddon]]'' seems to ignore the events of {{cl|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 24}} and {{cl|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 25|#25}}, as Kaine is alive and well and Ben seems to genuinely want to atone for his sins. As well, his absorption by Jennix is treated as his 28th death and not his 29th. His resurrection by the Superior Spider-Man did not appear to permanent corrupt him, and he even claims he has been returned to "factory settings."
| Trivia                  = * During his brief tenure as The Sensational Spider-Man, Ben dyed his hair [[:Category:Blond Hair|blond]], to lessen his resemblance to Peter Parker.{{r|Sensational Spider-Man #0}} Since his return in ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'', the hair has returned to being brunette. It was suggested by Peter that Ben has kept it this way so he could replace Peter should he not go along with his plans.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 4}} After being contacted by the Beyond Corporation to become Spider-Man once more, Ben dyed his hair blond again.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 75}}
* Ben, like all of Peter's clones, does not set off Peter's Spider-Sense and vice versa.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #217}}
* Venom was not hidden from Ben's Spider-Sense as the symbiote was never bonded to him; however, in {{cl|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 16}}, he claims that wasn't true.
* In the story "What If Spider-Man's Clone Had Lived?" from {{cl|What If? Vol 1 30}}, an alternate climax to ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #149 is presented, in which the clone knocks Peter out, thinking he is the clone, and is able to rescue Gwen Stacy's clone and Ned Leeds. He then locks Peter in a Cryo Tube and, after living Peter's life for a day, realizes that he is the clone. He wakes Peter up and informs him about the Kingpin challenging him. After the defeat of the Kingpin, Peter and his clone agree to live together and share duties as Spider-Man. Since, in this tale, he doesn't go in to exile, the clone is never referred to as Ben in this story.
* In the [[Earth-9602|Amalgam Universe]], Ben (during his time as Spider-Man) was combined with [[w:c:dc:Kon-El (New Earth)|Superboy]], creating [[Peter Ross (Earth-9602)|Spider-Boy]].
* Ben's first death on Halloween day.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #240}}
* The one to give Ben the Scarlet Spider moniker was [[Ken Ellis (Earth-616)|Ken Ellis]].
* At some point, [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] created a group of clones that all claimed to be Ben Reilly.{{r|Wolverines #5}}
* The costume Ben Reilly temporarily wore in [[Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1|his new series]] was stolen by him from a cosplayer.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 1}}
* Ben's computer password is "Kaine." He claims it's because he's a sucker for sentiment.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 4}}
* According to [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]], Ben has died more than anyone else in the universe.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 7}}
* [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]] noted that Ben is slower on his right side.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 77}}
