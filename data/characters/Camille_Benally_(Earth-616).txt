===Origin & Drax===
Camille "Cammi" Benally was an average, 10-year-old human girl with an absent father and [[Mavis Benally (Earth-616)|an abusive alcoholic of a mother]] in the small town of [[Coot's Bluff]], [[Alaska (State)|Alaska]]. She encountered [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax the Destroyer]] when a prison ship he was on board crash landed on Earth just outside of her town. Cammi befriended Drax and protected Coot's Bluff from [[Paibok (Earth-616)|Paibok]], [[Lunatik (Mercenary) (Earth-616)|Lunatik]], and the [[Gh'Ree and R'Hos Blood (Earth-616)|Blood Brothers]]. During the battle, Drax gained a new body. A second prison ship later arrived and arrested both Drax and Cammi.{{r|Drax the Destroyer Vol 1 1|4}}

[[File:Camille Benally (Earth-616) from Annihilation The Nova Corps Files Vol 1 1 001.jpg|100px|thumb|left|Cammi]]
After arriving on [[Xandar]], Cammi joined with Drax, [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]], and the other [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] to take on [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]] and [[Annihilation Wave (Earth-616)|his Wave]].{{r|Annihilation: Prologue Vol 1 1}}{{r|Annihilation: Nova Vol 1 1|4}}{{r|Annihilation Vol 1 1|6}}

===Murderworld===
After the [[Annihilation (Event)|Annihilation War]], Cammi separated from Drax and became a space bandit. For eighteen months, she committed crimes against the [[Badoon]], [[Kree Empire|Kree]], [[Shi'ar Empire|Shi'ar]], and several others planets, races, and empires. She was eventually apprehended by [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] while stealing from a Shi'ar Warhawk. Cammi was interrogated by [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Special Agent Abigail Brand]], who offered to "lose" her and return her to [[Earth]] rather than extradite her to another's jurisdiction. Cammi adamantly requested not to be returned to Earth, but before the interrogation could progress further, Cammi was abducted by [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]].{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 3}}

Along with fifteen other young superheroes, Cammi was brought to [[Murderworld]] by Arcade for an all out death match.{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 1}} Cammi almost immediately separated from the others and began setting traps and spying on other camps to protect herself.{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 2}} She formed a temporary alliance with [[Christopher Powell (Earth-616)|Darkhawk]] before he disappeared,{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 3}} and was saved by [[Nico Minoru (Earth-616)|Nico]] and [[Chase Stein (Earth-616)|Chase]] of the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]], with whom she formed an alliance.{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 5}}

[[File:Camille Benally (Earth-616) from Avengers Arena Vol 1 17 001.jpg|thumb|150px|Cammi as "Cammihawk"]]
From then on she struggled to keep the peace among the other participants and was forced to take Chase by surprise and break his leg so that she could remove the [[Raptor Amulet|Darkhawk amulet]] from him and stop Nico from killing [[Cullen Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Cullen Bloodstone]].{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 17}}

Chase stopped the battle between them because [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat]] was losing control over her powers and was going to explode. [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-616)|Reptil]] turned into a dinosaur form to carry Hazmat out into the water away from everyone else. [[Katy & Timothy Bashir (Earth-616)|Apex]] tried to attack all the remaining survivors with the entire arsenal that Arcade had at his disposal, and because Chase was immobilized, Cammi returned the Darkhawk amulet to him to make him able to fight again. After [[Rebecca Ryker (Earth-616)|Death Locket]] killed Apex, the survivors were rescued and were treated by paramedics and Avengers while Cammi was treated by agent Abigail Brand.{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 18}}

===Undercover===
Over the course of the next few months Camille would try her best to blend in with normal society, having gotten back together with her mother Mavis. The weight of mundane living was slowly eating away at her sense of self, however as she would regularly sit through her parent's personal help talk meetings in order to make her family reunion work.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 1}} Eventually however her longing for adventure and redemption would lead her to seek out the other surviving teen heroes in response to Cullen's more erratic behavior posted on the web.

[[File:Camille Benally (Earth-616) from Avengers Undercover Vol 1 3 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cammi undercover]]
Worried about their brother in battle, she and the rest of them reconnoitered back at House Bloodstone to check up on him after [[Aiden Gillespie (Earth-616)|Anachronism]] sent out the call when he last lost sight of Cullen, still broken and bitterly obsessed with revenge. The crew tracked down his last whereabouts near of [[Bagalia City]], where his latest video showed him leaping into a pit without wearing his Bloodstone Ring.

When they got there and were spotted by young supervillains upon their entry into enemy territory. They were all shocked and surprised to find Cullen alive and well, partying in a bachelor pad owned by Arcade. Cammi was just as disoriented by his behavior as everyone else but chose to mingle at the party to take her mind off of things alongside Hazmat and Aiden.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 2}} She grew more and more distressed by how easily everyone else was taken in the the festivities when approached by senior members of the villain league, wanting to leave in that instant. 

She and the others were persuaded by Bloodstone to accompany him to murder their tormentor, Arcade, at a lavish new Murderworld galla.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 3}} Initially Camille was livid at Cullen for wrapping them up in a hot mess where rich billionaires murdered each other at the behest of their insane benefactors' bloodsport, but was quickly dissuaded by Nico who retorted that they all needed closure in order to heal.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 3}} After they were assailed by Arcade himself, who still had all of his powers from the previous Murderworld Arena he trapped them in; Death Locket managed to cut power and connectivity to his suit's systems. She and the rest of her compatriots proceeded to pummel him mercilessly, but was stunned and horrified when a previously-comatose Hazmat outright eviscerated him in cold blood right in front of them, to which she voiced concerns as to how their outright killing a man on a live, global television broadcast would most definitely land them all in jail or worse, right around the time a [[Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] capture team blew open the doors and arrested everyone.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 4}}

While imprisoned, Cammi's mother visited her in jail to give moral support, stating that no matter how bad things were, her daughter was the only reason she got up out of bed in the mornings; only for her and the rest of her friends to be snatched away via teleportation spell courtesy of [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]], wherein she and others were cordially invited by [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] to luxurious eats with an invitation to their supervillain gathering.

[[File:Camille Benally (Earth-616) from Avengers Undercover Vol 1 10 001.jpg|thumb|God Mode blasting off]]
Feeling  baited by everything that had happened so far Takeda, Aiden, and herself ruminated on their options presented to them. Either reject the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters]] generosity and be arrested again, or stick with them and become true supervillains. After hearing their idea to join up as undercover spies however, Camille flatly rejected the offer and decided to head home before things went south, only to be intercepted and detained again by [[Frank Payne (Earth-616)|Constrictor]] for rejecting the offer.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 5}} Back in lockup she spent the next span of time digging a hole in the wall in order to escape, only to find her exit lead directly to the Masters of Evil's main penthouse and that Arcade was in fact still alive.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 7|8}}

As the Masters and their new acolytes began their endgame after stealing a [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]] and crippling their organization's worldwide network with their help. Cammi managed to escape and somehow snuck aboard before they took off to terrorize the world.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 9}} 

She and Arcade worked out how to siphon Murderworld's God Mode setting through the commandeered warship's mainframe into her own space suit, but was snatched by Constrictor and [[Giuletta Nefaria (Earth-616)|Madame Masque]] scant moments after the download finished, both of whom were impressed by her achievements thus far. With the application in full swing, Camille managed to depose [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Zemo]] and his entire crew while using his live feed to reveal how she and her friends-turned-criminals initially infiltrated his order to find some kind of redemption from their atrocious past. She revealed that Arcade was still alive, but shamed the public for judging kids for wanting to kill their jailer while they watched his stream of the massacres in complacency on their cozy armchairs, before giving a final heartfelt farewell to her mother and flying off into space under her own power, admitting as she no longer felt she belonged on Earth.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 10}}

===Mercenary Adventures===
Over the coarse of her explorations, Cammi eventually partnered up with space adventurer [[Planet Terry (Terry) (Earth-616)|Planet Terry]] and coming into service of [[Pip Gofern (Earth-616)|Pip the Troll]], forming a mercenary crew.{{r|Drax Vol 1 #6}} She and Terry went to capture Drax to cash in on a bounty Pip had put on him. While feigning leaving him in peace, she had actually stashed several Cryo-Fusion detonators on Drax's ship, flash-freezing everyone onboard.{{r|Drax Vol 1 #7}}

While the two conversed in the brig of her partner's spaceship, she told him about her time stuck in Arcade's Murder World arena. When Drax commented on her trying to capture him, she assured him it was nothing personal, reinforcing the fact she '''did''' capture him. Drax responded by ripping a hole in the side of his captors' ship, miles above planetary surface, where she followed him outside gun blazing, only realizing what she'd done until her score spelled it out to her. After being rescued by Planet Terry, they both make surface fall in time to catch Pip's explanation of why he put the hit out on Douglas in the first place. With everything now full circle Cammi, Pip, and Terry help Drax escort the remaining kids in his care back to their respective home planets.{{r|Drax Vol 1 #8}} 

Along the way they're attacked by space pirates where Cammi and Terry jest about Drax not knowing they cannot communicate while in an airless vacuum. After depositing the princess in Drax's care whom Pip wanted safeguarded for a reward, she and the rest of the crew ruminated on why various other bounty hunters were still after him, she mentioned her time back in the arena she lived through. Saying what got her through the darkness was thinking about what he would've done in that situation, only to realize just how empty such a life truly is and she pitied him for it.{{r|Drax Vol 1 #8}}

Together with Planet Terry and Pip, Cammi joined [[Yondu Udonta (Earth-616)|Yondu]]'s mercenary band, the [[Ravagers (Earth-616)|Ravagers]]. They became involved with a group of refugees from an alien species who had the natural ability to materialize their prayers into diamonds, helping them move from planet to planet to escape [[Chargazel (Earth-616)|Chargazel]]'s [[Raiders (Chargazel) (Earth-616)|Raiders]]. They eventually settled on [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego the Living Planet]], where the [[Asgardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Asgardians of the Galaxy]] stumbled into them. Shortly afterwards, the Raiders assaulted the refugee camp,{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 6}} but the two groups worked together to repel them. They parted ways afterwards; the Ravagers remained on Ego while the Asgardians continued their way.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 7}}

Cammi eventually joined a different entourage of pirates after they fished her out of an interstellar penitentiary, but didn't have much of a relationship with them as her old crew. While claiming some stuff from a destroyed [[Shi'ar Empire]] incarceration facility, including a [[Frank Castle (Earth-TRN666)|skull]], she went back to her own deal doing personal stuff, while listening to music, unbeknownst to her at the time however. The skull begun killing all of the crew in order to reform its own body. After discovering the corpse of the captain, she faced the Cosmic Ghost Rider, who destroyed the entire ship and used his [[Penance Stare]] on her. She was revealed to be immune, since she hadn't any terrible sins to weigh down her soul.{{r|Revenge of the Cosmic Ghost Rider Vol 1 1}} The two began fighting various criminals throughout the universe, but they eventually faced the [[Cosmic King (Earth-616)|Cosmic King]] who then devoured Cammi.{{r|Revenge of the Cosmic Ghost Rider Vol 1 2|3}} Instead of being eaten she instead went back in time shortly after Thanos was killed. She met the Cosmic King's children, and then witnessed an "ancient space demon parasite" killing the Cosmic King and making his corpse its new host. Cammi then returned to the present, and reunited with Frank who had recently got his soul back. However, [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] arrived wanting to get back the soul he rightfully owned, but instead got Cammi's soul as replacement for Frank's.{{r|Revenge of the Cosmic Ghost Rider Vol 1 4}} As a soul Cammi tried to talk her way out with Mephisto, but was then imprisoned. After Frank gave his soul back to Mephisto to exchange it with Cammi's, she returned back to life. Sadly it was all in vain, as the alien demon reawakened and killed Cammi again turning her its new host.{{r|Revenge of the Cosmic Ghost Rider Vol 1 5}}
