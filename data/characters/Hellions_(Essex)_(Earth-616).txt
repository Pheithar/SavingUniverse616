| HistoryText             = When [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] established a new mutant nation state on [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], all mutants were granted Krakoan citizenship.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}. Though most Krakoan mutants rapidly adapted to life in this exclusively mutant society, some proved to be problematic cases to Krakoan authorities. [[Manuel de la Rocha (Earth-616)|Empath]], [[Orphan-Maker (Peter) (Earth-616)|Orphan-Maker]], [[Nanny (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Nanny]], [[Kyle Gibney (Earth-616)|Wild Child]], [[John Greycrow (Earth-616)|Greycrow]], and [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] were mutants considered by the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council of Krakoa]] to be pariahs even among their own race, since their hostile and violent behavior constantly led to aggressive interactions with other Krakoans. To solve the problem these mutants posed, [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] proposed to assign them to a special group in order to channel their unstable attitude into something productive to Krakoan interests. [[Kwannon (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] was invited by [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] to act as a watchdog for the team, since her powers, personality and training were considered to be adequate to handle the group. Sinister's first mission for his new team was to destroy [[State Home for Foundlings|his former orphanage]]'s clone farms. However, the orphanage was the new home of the [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Goblin Queen]], who was in charge of Sinister's former [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]].{{r|Hellions Vol 1 1}}
