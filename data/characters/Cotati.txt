| HistoryText             = The '''Cotati''' evolved on the planet [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]], alongside the [[Kree]]. The Cotati were a pacifistic race whereas the Kree were warlike barbarians. Due to these cultural differences, the two races had little to no interaction with each other.{{r|Avengers #133}}

===Conflict with the Kree===
<!-- Might revise this -->
About a million years ago, the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] arrived on Hala. At that point, the Skrulls were a peaceful race and wished to share their knowledge and technology in exchange for loyalty. To avoid any dissension between the two races regarding which would represent Hala, the Skrulls proposed a test: They would take seventeen Cotati and seventeen Kree. The race that accomplished the most in that time would win.

[[File:Cotati from Road to Empyre The Kree Skrull War Vol 1 1 002.jpg|thumb|left|Primitive Cotati]]
Seventeen Kree were dropped on the dark side of [[Earth]]'s [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]] for a year, while the Cotati were dropped on another planetoid. Over the course of the year, the Cotati grew a beautiful garden by using their mental powers to search out ancient seeds and water. Meanwhile, the Kree built an entire city on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]]. Angered by their city losing to a simple garden, the Kree led by [[Morag (Earth-616)|Morag]] ambushed and killed the Cotati on Hala.{{r|Empyre Handbook Vol 1 1}}

===Priests of Pama===
As the Cotati died, they dropped seed pods into the ground. Over time and unbeknownst to the Kree, these seeds reached full maturity and uprooted themselves. To better conceal their existence, the Cotati hid in the basement of an abandoned Kree building. Over the centuries, the Cotati relinquished their mobility, believing it would lead to further conflicts with the Kree.

In the Kree year 476, the Cotati and a group of Kree pacifists entered into an agreement where the Cotati would teach the pacifists their knowledge of telepathy in exchange for protection. A century later, these pacifists became known as the [[Priests of Pama (Earth-616)|Priests of Pama]]. The Kree Empire grew to despise the Priests and had them exiled. Through the machinations of the Cotati, the Priests were permitted to travel to inhabited planets in groups of two. The Priests secretly took the Cotati with them, planting them throughout the known universe, which included [[Earth]],{{r|Avengers #134}} and [[Zenn-La]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 7|8}}

===The Celestial Madonna===
A prophecy soon arose which stated that the perfect human, the [[Celestial Madonna]], would mate with the perfect Cotati, the [[Swordsman (Cotati) (Earth-616)|Eldest Cotati]], to give birth to the perfect child, the [[Celestial Messiah]]. After [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]] and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] buried the body of [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]] inside the priest's temple the Cotati elder possessed Swordsman's body in order to mate with Mantis.{{r|Giant-Size Avengers Vol 1 4}}

===The Celestial Messiah===
After Mantis gave birth to the pod that would become the Celestial Messiah,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 4}} the Cotati decided they were more fit to raise the child and stripped Mantis off her powers and stole away the pod.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 323}} The Cotati went to a pyramid on Earth, having allied themselves with [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]]. They ordered Mantis and her allies, the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] and the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]], to cease her quest of retrieving her son. When they refused Kang and the Priests of Pama attacked the heroes, Mantis was able to overpower the Priests and confront the High Cotati thanks to her training. The Cotati fled to their chosen realm of pure thought pursued by Mantis who once again left her physical body behind.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 325}}

Mantis was seemingly able to retrieve her son as she spent roughly a year raising her son, [[Sequoia (Earth-616)|Sequoia]] in [[Connecticut (State)|Connecticut]], before sending him to the Cotati's new homeworld [[Tamal]].{{r|Avengers: Celestial Quest Vol 1 2}}

===Silver Surfer===
When Mantis was attacked by the [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elders of the Universe]], she sent a telepathic cry for help to the Cotati of Zen-La, who then contacted [[Shalla-Bal (Construct) (Earth-616)|Shalla-Bal]] to help Mantis.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 7|8}}

When [[Reptyl (Earth-616)|Reptyl]] planned to capture Silver Surfer to use him as a energy source, one of the Cotati aboard his ship told the other members about this. The Cotati discussed wherever help or not the Silver Surfer, but eventually decided to help him, and manipulated [[Clumsy Foulup (Earth-616)|Clumsy Foulup]] who started the events which lead to the rescue of the Silver Surfer.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 12}}

When the Silver Surfer was involved in the second [[Kree-Skrull War]], the Cotati, wanting to befriend the Silver Surfer, told to Shalla Bal about the Skrull [[Nenora (Earth-616)|Nenora]] who had disguised herself as a high Kree Imperial.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 20|30}} After Shalla Bal finally found out that Nenora was actually a Skrull,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 27}} Nenora drugged Shalla in order to keep her disguise a secret, but the Cotati were able to use their mental powers to free Shalla from the drugs' influence.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 29}}

When a [[Tath Ki (Skrull) (Earth-616)|imposter]] disguised as the [[Tath Ki (Earth-616)|Contemplator]] tried to seize the [[Kree Empire]], Clumsy Foulup and some white-skinned Kree soldiers sought the help of the Cotati who agreed to help them. When the imposter tried to use his mental powers to take over the [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]], the Cotati used their own mental powers to drive the imposter mad and take control of the Supreme Intelligence to make Clumsy the new emperor of the Kree.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 31}}

===Celestial Quest===
Mantis and the Avengers went to Tamal in order to protect Quoi from [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]], and were welcomed by many Cotati, including "Swordsman".{{r|Avengers: Celestial Quest Vol 1 3}} However, despite their protection [[Raptra (Earth-616)|Raptra]] managed to kidnap Quoi. This angered the Cotati collective who accused the Avengers for their failure and assaulted them. Luckily, the Avengers managed to escape.{{r|Avengers: Celestial Quest Vol 1 5}}

===[[Annihilation: Conquest]]===
An unnamed Cotati who dwelt with the Priests of Pama on a Kree planet began assisting [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-616)|Phyla-Vell]] after she acquired the [[Quantum Bands]] which had been corrupted by [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]]. The Cotati was eventually slayed during the onslaught brought by the [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]] and [[Super-Adaptoid (Earth-616)|Super-Adaptoid]].{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Quasar Vol 1 1}}

===Starbrand & Nightmask===
After the destruction of Hala, [[Kree-Pama]] seemingly became the homeworld for both Kree and Cotati. [[Trrunk (Earth-616)|Trrunk]] was a Cotati living on Kree-Pama who received the powers of [[Justice]] after the [[White Event]], but was killed alongside [[Mar-Sohn (Earth-616)|Nightmask]] by the [[Va-Sohn (Earth-616)|Starbrand]].{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask Vol 1 2|5}}

===[[Empyre (Event)|Empyre]]===
Under the influence of his father, the Cotati Swordsman,{{r|Empyre Vol 1 4}} Quoi became convinced that animal life was the root of evil in the universe. The Celestial Messiah led his people into abandoning their peaceful ways to take revenge for the slaughter of their ancestors and take over the entire universe. They first started experimenting with a power-enhancing flower called the [[Death Blossom]] in the Skrulls' [[Kral (Star)|Kral System]], but escaped before the Skrulls destroyed the system using a star-detonating device called the [[Pyre (Item)|Pyre]].{{r|Empyre Vol 1 2}} The Cotati continued cutting a swathe through Skrull and Kree territory alike, and the two warring empires agreed to put aside their differences and unite, becoming the [[Kree/Skrull Alliance (Earth-616)|Kree/Skrull Alliance]].{{r|Lords of Empyre: Emperor Hulkling Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Empyre (Earth-616) and Kree Skrull Alliance (Earth-616) from Empyre Vol 1 3 001.jpg|thumb|right|Cotati soldiers fighting the Alliance on Earth]]
The Cotati attempted to stop the consolidation of the Alliance, murdering key Alliance sponsors [[Bel-Dann (Earth-616)|Bel-Dann]] and [[Raksor (Earth-616)|Raksor]], but the Kree and the Skrull moved faster and appointed Kree/Skrull hybrid [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]] as their figurehead.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 2}} After the Cotati converged in the Blue Area of the Moon, foresting it into a garden to plant a Death Blossom, Quoi and Swordsman sent a distress call to the Avengers, using their pacifist pretense to convince the heroes that they were the innocent targets of a genocide by the Alliance.{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 0}} When the Alliance's war fleet arrived at the Moon, the Avengers and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] intercepted them, buying the Cotati enough time for the Death Blossom to bloom. With its power-boosting energies, the Cotati ravaged the Alliance fleet and launched an invasion on Earth.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 1}} The Cotati stretched the Alliance's and Earth's forces thin by attacking different points in the planet, with their endgame being to invade [[Wakanda]] and plant a Death Blossom on its [[Vibranium]]-enriched soil, which would span the Cotati's reach to a galactic level.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 3}}

After the Cotati breached into Wakanda and planted the Death Blossom, [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] led a final contingent of Earth's heroes against the invaders, using an [[Mister Fantastic's Armor|armor]] designed by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] that could disrupt the Cotati's plant-controlling powers. The final battle saw Swordsman hold his own son at sword-point in an attempt to escape, after which he was stabbed by the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] using Hulkling's [[Excelsior (Star-Sword)|Star-Sword]], and then pushed into the Death Blossom, destroying both. Afterward, the Cotati surrendered.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 6}} They were rounded up and teleported to a secluded planet in uncharted space, where they would live in peace in a new garden without the ability to pose a threat to anyone.{{r|Empyre: Fallout Fantastic Four Vol 1 1}}
