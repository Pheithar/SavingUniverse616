Flavius Scollio was a soldier for [[Caligula (Earth-616)|Emperor Caligula]] stationed at an outpost in [[Africa]]. He was sent by his commander to investigate an anomalous phenomenon, which he discovered was a crashed alien spacecraft. The craft was inhabited by a single alien, which Flavius killed. He then donned the armor which imbued him with power to mentally manipulate his surroundings and advanced longevity. Using the armor, Flavius created the [[Black Tower of M'Kumbe]] in [[Wakanda]], which housed a kingdom modeled after ancient Rome inside, where he resided for nearly two thousand years. Over the years, Flavius captured people from the surrounding area to be his subjects.

Flavius captured the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] and [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] when they arrived to investigate the tower. Flavius fancied the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Girl]] with the intention of making her his wife, but his plan was foiled when she removed the helmet. With the helmet removed, revealing his body had long since been eaten away by the power of the armor, which only his amplified intellect remained, now gone, everything he created was destroyed created and reduced his people to a pile of dust and bones.{{r|Fantastic Four #241}}
