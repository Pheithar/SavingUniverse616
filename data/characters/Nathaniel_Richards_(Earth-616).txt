===Early life===
Dr. Nathaniel Richards was a brilliant scientist, expert in several fields. He became very wealthy and respected in the scientific community. He met and married [[Evelyn Richards (Earth-616)|Evelyn]] and together they lived in [[Central City]], [[California (State)|California]]. They had a son [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed]] who, like his father before him, was a child prodigy with special aptitudes for mathematics, physics, and mechanics. Evelyn died when Reed was seven. Nathaniel encouraged and guided young Reed in his scientific studies, and fostered in his son an insatiable love of science, exploration, and discovery, as well as a respect for the consequences of such science.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 570}}

[[File:S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 5 Stark & Richards Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|250px|"Brotherhood of the Shield"]]
===Brotherhood of the Shield===
He was approached by a mysterious organization called the [[Brotherhood of the Shield (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of the Shield]] who had appointed themselves the protectors of [[Earth]]. The group had protected the human race from threats for centuries. Back in 1953, just after the death of [[Joseph Stalin (Earth-616)|Joseph Stalin]], the leader of the Soviet Union, two prominent [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, billionaire industrialist [[Howard Stark (Earth-616)|Howard Stark]] and scientist Dr. Richards, recruited a mysterious young man named [[Leonid (Earth-616)|Leonid]] who possessed amazing superhuman powers. They took the powerful young man to the Brotherhood of the Shield High Council in the [[Immortal City]] under [[Rome (Italy)|Rome]]. The High Council made them aware of "The Final Fate of Man", and appointed themselves the task of protecting the Earth until that event. They revealed to Leonid his destiny to help in their endeavor.{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 2 1|6}}

Leonid met [[Leonardo da Vinci (Earth-616)|Leonardo da Vinci]], who had apparently traveled through time to use his device to save the world. Da Vinci's return was met with resistance from [[Isaac Newton (Earth-616)|Isaac Newton]] who saw it as a threat to his reign as leader of the organization. This eventually lead to the organization splitting into two factions: one led by Newton and one led by Da Vinci. Richards, Stark, and [[Nikola Tesla (Earth-616)|Night Machine]] traveled to the [[Immortal City]] and tried to stop the two battling factions by placing the decision of leadership in Leonid's hands, so he chose Da Vinci over Newton and escaped into the future. As a result of Nathaniel's time with them, he was present at the death of a quantum-powered superhuman. As a result, he gained the ability to propel himself through time.{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 2 1|4}}

===Time Traveler===
However, this accident dropped him in Earth's distant future, as well as drawing all parallel universe versions of him to the same locality. This gathering was found by Immortus, who gave the group a sadistic choice: one lives, or all die. The various versions of Nathaniel Richards were forced to kill each other in a cosmic game of cat-and-mouse.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 581}} In an effort to avoid the slaughter, Nathaniel spent much of the following years on the run, away from his family. Three years before the accident that gave Reed his powers, Nathaniel disappeared seemingly for good, leaving his son two billion dollars and retaining the family's butler and maid, Mr. and Mrs. Peacock, in the family estate. He did this to ensure that no one would declare him dead before he returned.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 271|272}}

Richards was actually in hiding on [[Earth-6311]], a parallel Earth. He found himself on a planet that had been devastated by a war that occurred centuries before, between the people of the Earth and the human colonists of the Moon, ending in the destruction of the Moon itself.{{r|Fantastic Four #272}} Nathaniel traveled around the war-torn planet, helping people with his scientific knowledge, until one day he met the Queen of the dominant race of humans. He gave her the information to better her people and create for them amazing machines, including flying, metal dragons that they rode on. In gratitude, the Queen gave Nathaniel her eldest daughter to marry. Nathaniel later discovered a citadel that held powerful, yet ancient, machines and rebuilt it to live in. The Queen and her people left him with a workforce made up of ape-like mutates from the Southern parts of the planet, but returned three years later to find the citadel transformed into a fortress, and Nathaniel seemingly calling himself the Warlord. The Queen discovered that, soon after the construction of the fortress was finished, the Warlord had attacked the nearest township and declared himself the ruler of the world.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 272}}

In fact, the Warlord was not Nathaniel, but his wife, [[Cassandra Richards (Earth-6311)|Cassandra]]. She kept him lulled in his citadel, pretending to love him and eventually bearing him [[Warlord's Son (Richards) (Earth-6311)|a son]]. But she secretly lusted after power and disguised herself as Nathaniel, in his armor. It was to this newly ravaged world that the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] traveled, searching for Reed's father so that Reed could fill in certain holes in his memory. They found people dressed as cowboys from the Old West, but carrying laser guns and riding on flying, metal steeds. The four soon met with the Queen, who told them the history of the Warlord, and Reed himself approached the fortress, alone, to reason with his father. Yet the Warlord attacked him, sending her troops against his team, until [[Wyatt Wingfoot (Earth-616)|Wyatt Wingfoot]] snuck around and threw a rock into a powerful, antimatter weapon that the Warlord prepared to end the fight with. The resulting explosion knocked Wyatt out but killed the Warlord, Nathaniel's wife. When Wyatt recovered, Nathaniel had joined them and spoke with his son. He was ashamed that he had been fooled for so many years by his wife and vowed to rebuild the world that his technology had devastated. The Fantastic Four left shortly afterwards, returning to their own time.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 273}}

===Return to the Past===
Years later, Nathaniel appeared in [[Four Freedoms Plaza]] and explained to his grandson, [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]], that he had come to help him. The Fantastic Four soon arrived, and Nathaniel greeted his son, and his daughter-in-law, the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]]. He explained that while traveling through the time-stream he found a possible future of his home-Earth, where [[Sentinels]] took over the planet and eventually killed most of the mutant populace, including Franklin. Though [[Agatha Harkness (Earth-616)|Agatha Harkness]] announced that she detected truth in his words, she also revealed that he was hiding something that involved Reed. Nathaniel told them that the Sentinels were efficient because they used technology invented by Reed, himself. When Reed interrupted the conversation to speak with [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]], their attorney, concerning the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]]'s brush with the law, Nathaniel was left with Agatha. She told him that she knew his mission, but would stay silent because she felt it necessary, and asked if they would hate them for it. Nathaniel replied that they would, as they should.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 376}}

Once Reed was distracted with the problem of the Sentinel's circuitry, Nathaniel made his move and fired at his own son, knocking him out. He revealed that his true goal was to remove Franklin-who he described as a danger to the entire universe-completely from their timeline. But Susan refused to allow him and prepared to fight him, but Agatha tried to stop her with her sorceress powers. Franklin himself turned on Nathaniel, angered that he had turned Agatha against Franklin's mother, and used his psychic powers to fire blasts of mental energy that Nathaniel's suit could barely protect him from. Susan quickly subdued Agatha, and Nathaniel fended off [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] who jumped in to help, whom he quickly subdued as well. Then Reed appeared and he and his wife fought Nathaniel together, though Nathaniel fired a neuro-scrambler at Susan to distract them. She blasted it out of air, and pointed at Nathaniel too late, as he grabbed Franklin and disappeared into the time-stream. While Reed, Susan, and Agatha argued with each other about whose fault it was, a figure reappeared moments later in Nathaniel's armor. They assumed it was Nathaniel himself, but the figure revealed himself to be a [[Franklin Richards (Earth-6311)|teenage version of Franklin]], sent back from the future by his grandfather.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 376}} 

Nathaniel later transported to [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]'s castle and reprogrammed Doom's robots to believe that Nathaniel was Doom, himself. He then disguised himself as Doom and revealed himself to the people of [[Latveria]] as their monarch. Nathaniel used Doom's machines to contact his grandson, Franklin, telling him to turn to Nathaniel's son to save the world, though he pointedly did not specify which son. While searching for Reed, Nathaniel's daughter-in-law appeared at Castle Doomstadt, investigating rumors that Doom had returned. But she found Nathaniel in his place, who announced that he was searching for his son, and asked for her help, but explained that Reed was not the son he sought. Nathaniel told Susan that he searched for his son, which he had fathered during his travels through the time-stream, who became the absolute ruler of [[Latveria]], implying to her that Doom was his own son, as well as Reed. But his responses to her questions gave her little reason to trust any explanation or facts he gave her. Together they traveled to Tibet and the Monastery of Doom. While she fought the armed guards, Nathaniel found his own way inside and fired at Susan's back when she discovered two sealed, person-sized containment tubes.

While Susan looked on in horror, Nathaniel opened the pods to reveal [[Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)|Kristoff Vernard]] and Doom's servant, Boris (who was actually [[Artur Zarrko (Earth-6297)|Zarrko]] the Tomorrow Man in disguise). Then Nathaniel, Kristoff, Susan, and Boris joined up with the rest of the Fantastic Four to fight against [[Aron (Earth-616)|Aron]] the Rogue Watcher, who had disguised himself as [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu]]. But when they transported to Uatu's base on the Moon, and Aron revealed himself and attacked them, Nathaniel retreated rather than face his powers.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 397|400}} 

===Fantastic Force===
Nathaniel's grandson, Franklin, and his [[Fantastic Force (Earth-616)|Fantastic Force]] team later followed one of the flaming apparitions of Susan that warned them to help the Fantastic Four, back to its source, using [[Tara Richards (Earth-6311)|Huntara]]'s scythe. What they found was Nathaniel, posing as Doctor Doom, and using the fake apparitions to control his grandson and daughter-in-law. Huntara attacked Nathaniel, intending to kill him for his traitorous crimes, but Franklin stopped her before she could finish him. Then, Nathaniel took them to the Watcher's base to join the Fantastic Four. After Huntara rescued Susan from the [[Negative Zone]] where Aron had thrown her, the entire group jumped into the cosmic rift that swallowed Uatu, and found themselves in the middle of a trial. The defendant was [[One (Watcher) (Earth-616)|the One]], the repository of all Watcher knowledge, judged by [[Arishem (Earth-616)|Arishem]], the Celestial Judge. After finding the last piece of a super weapon they needed to defeat Aron, Susan sent the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] and the Fantastic Force to face Aron, while Nathaniel and the rest turned on the [[Celestials]] to save the Watchers very existence. They faced off against [[Exitar (Earth-616)|Exitar the Executioner]], who had been powering up for centuries to obliterate the One, and Nathaniel explained to Susan that her powers came from hyperspace, where the Celestials existed, and so they were enough to damage them. Susan used her force powers to tear a hole in the side of Exitar's body, and they entered him to destroy him.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 400}}

They eventually reached the core of the Celestial, where a mirage of Susan appeared to reason with them and explain the purpose of the Celestials. Though it recounted the history of the Celestials, and informed Susan that they needed to survive-over the Watchers-she lashed out and blew apart its nerve center when it attacked the One. The group inside the Celestial fell to the ground when it disappeared, and Uatu gathered them together in his shield, explaining that they had only stalled the confrontation between the Watchers and Celestials by a few millennia-as each group would eventually rebuild its strongest member. Then, when pressed, Uatu joined them and the other group against Aron, and used his own power to erase Aron from existence. [[He Who Summons (Earth-616)|He Who Summons]] appeared moments later and cast Uatu out of the Watchers for his crimes and excessive involvement, but Uatu was left with enough power to send the whole group back to Earth.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 400}}

===Hyperstorm===
After Nathaniel accidentally robbed the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] of its artificial atmosphere, creating a panic in the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] that was only fixed when the Fantastic Four shrunk Attilan to save them, Nathaniel offered his services to [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]] to restore the city to its original size. He interrupted his attempts to save the city when Hyperstorm began to plot against the Fantastic Four. Nathaniel tried to stop them from traveling to Latveria, but failed, and while transporting out his beam was intercepted by [[Jonathan Richards (Earth-967)|Hyperstorm]]. His future descendent trapped Nathaniel and taunted him with his failure to stop his own plans to destroy the Fantastic Four. Imprisoned, Nathaniel mocked Zarrko, making him insecure, which inadvertently sent him into the room with an equally imprisoned Doctor Doom, who had recently freed his mind enough to lock Zarrko's gaze with his, and transfer his mind into Zarrko's body. Zarrko then freed Nathaniel and they plotted to surprise Hyperstorm. Together the two fought their way through Hyperstorm's robots, but Nathaniel separated from Doctor Doom-Zarrko when he saw his son, Reed, returned and being attacked by Hyperstorm's robots, along with his family.

Nathaniel arrived to the fight in time to direct Susan to use her powers, as she had against the Celestials, and she tore apart Hyperstorm's destructoids. But Hyperstorm appeared directly afterwards, and they turned to battle him. Hyperstorm turned out to be too powerful, and Nathaniel and Susan convinced Reed that his abilities were better suited to finding a solution in Doom's labs; so then Nathaniel and Reed left Susan to fight Hyperstorm alone. Reed tried to convince Doom, who used some of his own mechanisms to attack Hyperstorm, to work with him to defeat his future descendant, but Doom's ego would not allow him to. Soon enough, Hyperstorm appeared and shuttled Doom off to his own Latveria, in his own timeline, in order to embarrass him with his inability to defeat Hyperstorm. Then, instead of crushing the surrounding heroes, Hyperstorm healed the Thing's face-that [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] had scarred-and sent them home, as well, commanding them to leave him to his plans, and not interfere again.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 405|408}}

When Susan later collapsed in a fight with an out of control [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]], Reed blamed his father for teaching her to use her powers to an extent that turned out to be too dangerous. Nathaniel countered that he was merely teaching her, her true potential. He watched as his son worked feverishly to come up with a solution to the threat of Hyperstorm, though Nathaniel warned him continuously that he was wasting his time, and endangering himself. Reed even went as far as trying to contact the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] or [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] to assist them, though the Surfer revealed that Galactus had seemingly died at the hands of his former herald, [[Morg (Earth-616)|Morg]]. When Reed returned from his visit to the Surfer, Nathaniel and his son's family watched as a [[Time Platform|time platform]] descended on Franklin, from Hyperstorm, returning Franklin to his true age. Forced by the situation, Nathaniel explained that he had previously stolen and aged Franklin because Franklin was destined to, one day, father Hyperstorm along with [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]], the child of [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]]. Nathaniel continued to explain that-in all the timelines he had researched-the Fantastic Four were fated to die at the hands of Hyperstorm.

Despite Nathaniel's warnings, Reed was insistent that he would find a way to defeat Hyperstorm. To that end, he traveled to the last known location of Galactus-with his family and friends stubbornly following him-and set up a machine to recall the world devourer. Hyperstorm soon appeared and attacked the collected heroes, and even Nathaniel turned on him and poured fire upon him, until Hyperstorm swatted him away. Then, as it seemed that Hyperstorm would win, Reed managed to hit a button on his device and open a portal to where Galactus lay exiled by his own hand, and the devourer grew angry at being summoned. Though he immediately sensed a source of unlimited power and energy in Hyperstorm and attacked him, feeding off of the hyperspace energies that Hyperstorm controlled. Reed's device then shut back off, sealing both Galactus and Hyperstorm in the dimensional void, ending the threat.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 409|414}}

Before they could celebrate, the entity known as [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]] attacked Four Freedoms Plaza-looking for Franklin Richards. Nathaniel jumped on his back, planning to use his armor to siphon off psionic energies from Onslaught; but Onslaught's power was too strong, and he shattered Nathaniel's armor, leaving him defenseless. After Onslaught kidnapped Franklin, Nathaniel gave his son one last, final warning, revealing to him that he had seen in the timelines that the Fantastic Four and many of Earth's heroes were destined to be obliterated while fighting Onslaught. Reed ignored him, and Nathaniel left them to their fight against Onslaught. Seemingly true to Nathaniel's portents, Reed and many of Earth's heroes disappeared from existence while fighting and defeating Onslaught, but in fact they were actually drawn into a [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Counter-Earth]] created by Nathaniel's young grandson, Franklin, then later brought back out to their home reality.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 415|416}}{{r|Onslaught Marvel Universe Vol 1 1}}

===Future Foundation===
Just after the death of [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Johnny Storm]] at the hands of [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]], Nathaniel returned to the past, to help his son and the [[Future Foundation (Earth-616)|Future Foundation]] using his knowledge of the future.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 588}}

Due to the presence of Reed Richardses of alternate universes, Mr. Fantastic made an alliance with many villains such as [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]], [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]], [[Esteban Corazón de Ablo (Earth-616)|Diablo]], and [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] to plan how to stop them.{{r|FF #1|2}} Then they lead the battle to High Evolutionary's city where one of the Richards escaped with Doctor Doom and the others two were captured by the Kree army. After returning to the [[Baxter Building]], Richards reunited other heroes to fight the Inhumans in Attilan, but at the time they were preparing to go at the rooftop, a Kree invasion started. Reed used Iron Man's armor and Sue's power to create a force field around Manhattan, at the same time the [[Cult of the Negative Zone (Earth-616)|Cult of the Negative Zone]] opened the portal to the [[Negative Zone]] after [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] failed at stop them, the portal revealed a living Johnny Storm with an enslaved [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 600}}

Then Johnny gathered the team by drawing the symbolical "4" at the sky above the Baxter Building with his fire. Reed, Sue, Ben and Peter boarded one of the [[Annihilation Wave (Earth-616)|Annihilation Wave]]'s ships controlled by Johnny, who used the rest of the ships to battle the Kree army until the Inhumans asked to finish them by their own hand. Meanwhile the other heroes on Earth where dealing with the scraps of the battle which could damage the Earth, Reed and Sue summoned Galactus, who completely destroyed the Kree army.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 601|604}}

Meanwhile, in [[Latveria]], Nathaniel and the rest of the Future Foundation helped the [[Reed Richards (Earth-12498)|Reed-Alpha]] from the other universe to rebuild the Bridge (an interdimensional portal) to return to his universe, but the Mad Celestials kill him, as well as Doctor Doom. Using the bridge, the [[Celestials (Race)#Mad_Celestials_.28Earth-4280.29|Mad Celestials]] appeared to destroy this universe. Although the team tried to use the Hub (a weapon of mass destruction created by the Reeds), they couldn't defeat the Mad Celestials. Then, a future version of [[Franklin Richards (Earth-10774)|Franklin]] and [[Valeria Richards (Earth-10774)|Valeria]] appeared as part of Nathaniel's plan. The Future Franklin used his power to heal Galactus and destroy the Mad Celestials, saving the day.{{r|FF Vol 1 2|15}} In the aftermath, Nathaniel decided to return to his travels and reach out to the alternate versions of Reeds that grew up without a father because of the contest.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 611}}

At some point in time, Nathaniel eventually died. In preparation for this, he constructed an artifact called [[Prize|The Prize]] intended for Reed. Mister Fantastic managed to get his hands on it after thwarting Immortus' attempt to obtain the device, and reconstructed it. The Prize turned out to be a pre-recorded message in which Nathaniel confessed to Reed the existence of a half-sister from a second marriage he had had on Earth.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 15}}
