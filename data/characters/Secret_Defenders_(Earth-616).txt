===Doctor Strange===
With the Defenders disbanded, Dr. Strange organized his own "Secret Defenders" project, recruiting whichever heroes he required for a given mission, with no ongoing members.

When Dr. Strange would foresee dangers, he would use tarot cards to determine who would be best suited to help him battle the coming evil. If necessary, Strange would also teleport the team to the location they were needed. At times there seems to be a subtle pattern among those who choose to serve, such as [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] and [[Eric Masterson (Earth-616)|Thunderstrike]], [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Ant Man]] and [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] etc.

===Doctor Druid===
Strange later forced [[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Doctor Druid]] to take over for him while he was dealing with Salome and the War of the Seven Spheres. Druid and [[Jillian Woods (Earth-616)|Shadowoman]] were asked to protect the [[Moebius Stone]] from evil forces. The Stone ended up empowering [[Cody Fleischer (Earth-616)|Cadaver]], and the three became a regular team of sorts, based out of [[Doctor Druid's Sanctum]] in [[Boston]].

However, Druid grew tired of leading the group. Summoning the demon [[Slorioth]], he faked his death and the team disbanded, although Cadaver, Shadowoman and [[Joshua Pryce]] agreed to help each other if needed.
