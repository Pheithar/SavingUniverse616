During the fight, Flumm revealed what he'd done to everyone present, and escaped by releasing a psychic attack knocking everyone out.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Family Business Vol 1 1}}

===Pleasant Hill===
Sometime after this, Mentallo was captured and imprisoned by S.H.I.E.L.D. in [[Pleasant Hill]], a prison in the form of a small town where its inmates had their memories and appearances tampered with using a sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] named [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]], in order to transform them into model citizens.
