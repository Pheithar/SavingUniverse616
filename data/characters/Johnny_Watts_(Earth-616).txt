===Hawkeye Investigations===
Johnny first encountered [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Kate Bishop]] while on patrol after she had rescued a girl from some fraternity members in an alleyway near the [[Venice Police Department]] during her investigation into [[Take Back Control (Earth-616)|T.B.C.]]'s connection to the disappearance of Ramone's girlfriend, [[Mikka Nguyen (Earth-616)|Mikka Nguyen]].{{r|Hawkeye Vol 5 2}} The siblings joined [[Hawkeye Investigations (Earth-616)|Hawkeye Investigations]] and helped Hawkeye rescue Mikka from [[Aggregate (Greg) (Earth-616)|Aggregate]] in neighboring [[Marina del Rey]].{{r|Hawkeye Vol 5 2|4}}

He grew closer to Kate during investigations into the disappearances of both [[Rebecca Brown (Earth-616)|Rebecca Brown]],{{r|Hawkeye Vol 5 6}} as well as [[Liam Donnelly (Earth-616)|Liam Donnelly]],<!-- {{r|Hawkeye Vol 5 8|9}} --> unaware that Hawkeye's increasingly reckless behavior was a result of her having uncovered [[Derek Bishop (Earth-616)|her own father]]'s connections to both T.B.C. and her arch enemy, [[Giuletta Nefaria (Earth-616)|Madame Masque]].{{r|Hawkeye Vol 5 7|9}} Johnny, Ramone, and [[Quinn (Hawkeye Investigations) (Earth-616)|Quinn]] subsequently took it upon themselves to tip off [[Los Angeles Police Department (Earth-616)|LAPD]] [[Detective Rivera (LAPD) (Earth-616)|Detective Rivera]] to save Hawkeye from [[Clem (Fight Club) (Earth-616)|Clem]] and an underground fight club.{{r|Hawkeye Vol 5 9}}

Johnny's feelings for Kate became increasingly complicated when she was secretly replaced by Whitney Frost in a cloned body of Kate Bishop, who subsequently took their relationship to a physical level during a night out at the [[Mad House Danceclub]] on the [[Sunset Boulevard|Sunset Strip]] in [[West Hollywood]].{{r|Hawkeye Vol 5 10}} Hawkeye eventually confronted Madame Masque in the [[Hollywood Hills]], with their ensuing fight in [[Griffith Park]] forcing Kate to reveal to her friends Derek Bishop's connection to Mikka's kidnapping. These events also forced Kate to admit she'd been harboring feelings for Johnny as well.{{r|Hawkeye Vol 5 11}}

===West Coast Avengers===
Kate next sought to reform the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]] and naturally Johnny, now calling himself '''Fuse''', joined her endeavor, moving into the [[Hawkeye Investigations Office]] with Kate, which was being renovated to accommodate the new team's expanding roster.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 1}}
