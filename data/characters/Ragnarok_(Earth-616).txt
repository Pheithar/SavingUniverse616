===Origin===
Years ago when the Avengers first started, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] found a strand of hair that had fallen off of Thor's head. Tony kept the hair sample in case he might need it for later use.{{r|Civil War #4}}

When the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]] attempted to gain ratings for their reality show by capturing a group of escaped supervillains, [[Robert Hunter (Earth-616)|Nitro]] used his explosive powers which killed most of the New Warriors and children at a nearby school at a wide range. The government then proposed the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] to have all people with superhuman powers register with the government. When the Superhuman Registration Act became law, Tony knew that they would need some serious strength on their side and the time had come to use the strand of Thor's hair. Stark created a clone of Thor from the strand where he fused the clone DNA with [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]] technology. He did this by working together with [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] and Henry Pym, who unbeknownst to Stark was actually Skrull impostor [[Criti Noll (Earth-616)|Criti Noll]].{{r|Civil War #3}}

[[File:Thor (Clone) (Earth-616) Civil War Vol 1 7.png|thumb|left]]
===Civil War===
The Pro-Registration side eventually set a trap for the Anti-Registration group, who were now known as the [[Secret Avengers]]. When the Secret Avengers attempt to escape, the Thor clone used his mechanical hammer to blast a hole through [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Goliath]]'s chest, killing him instantly. The Thor clone continued his assault until the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]] uses her powers to protect the Secret Avengers and allow them to escape. The Thor clone was immediately shut down and taken back to base. Once they returned, Reed Richards began to examine what could have gone wrong with the clone.{{r|Civil War #4}}

The Thor clone provoked a wave of shock among the opponents.{{r|Civil War: Front Line #6}}{{r|Iron Man/Captain America: Casualties of War #1}}

During the final battle of the Civil War, Thor led [[Khn'nr (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] and the [[Order (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Order]] to the fight.{{r|Civil War #7}} He faced [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], unleashing his wrath upon her and causing damage to the [[Wakandan Embassy (New York City)|Wakandan Embassy]]. Storm was quickly joined by [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Susan Storm]] who wanted to destroy her husband's creation, but both were replaced by [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]],{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 25}} who destroyed him.{{r|Civil War #7}}

===Camp Hammond===
Under repair at [[Camp Hammond]], the clone was activated by a safety measure built into it by the [[Skrull]] that posed as Henry Pym, [[Criti Noll (Clone) (Earth-616)|Criti Noll]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #20}} Thinking he was Thor, the clone retook his hammer. But when [[Wernher von Blitzschlag (Earth-616)|Baron Von Blitzschlag]] told him that he was simply a clone, he was apparently killed for it. The clone, codenamed Ragnarok, went on a rampage, easily dispatching the [[Initiative]] and the New Warriors, who rushed to stop his violent march of destruction.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #21}} Baron Von Blitzschlag, who survived his previous encounter with Ragnarok, confronted him, goading him into attacking him with lightning, which only strengthened the old man.

Ragnarok was about to vanquish Von Blitzschlag with pure physical force when the crafty Baron dismissed the notion as futile. He stated that while he could easily kill everyone here or even in the world, this would not change what he was in fact: an android-clone of the real Thor. Unconvinced, Ragnarok was shown proof that such methods were possible when one of the [[Scarlet Spiders (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spiders]] revealed he and his "brothers" were all clones as well.

[[File:Thor Odinson (Ragnarok) (Earth-616) 0001.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Ragnarok as a member of the Dark Avengers]]
===Siege===
Blitzschlag told Ragnarok that the real Thor was living in [[Asgard]], which was now physically in the realm of Earth (or Midgard), floating above Oklahoma. Ragnarok resolved that it mattered not whether he was or wasn't a clone, but rather that his warrior's resolve was true.{{r|Thor #607}} He flew off to presumably confront Thor and his fellow Asgardians and battled [[Volstagg (Earth-616)|Volstagg]] during the [[Siege (Event)|Siege of Asgard]].{{r|Thor #608}} Ultimately, Ragnarok was killed by the real Thor.{{r|Thor #610}}

===Dark Avengers===
[[File:Thor Odinson (Ragnarok) (Earth-616) from Dark Avengers Vol 1 190 005.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ragnarok and Moonstone]]
Ragnarok's body was recovered by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], who lacked the resources to repair it. However, when A.I.M. joined a reborn [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] they finally were able to, and [[Monica Rappaccini (Earth-616)|Monica Rappaccini]] promised to rebuild it for [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s new team of [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 18}} They fought the Avengers on Osborn's behalf but were eventually defeated and imprisoned together with Osborn.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 #19|23}}

===New Thunderbolts===
After the Thunderbolts went missing in the timestream, the Dark Avengers were recruited as a replacement team. They were implanted with nanites in order to prevent them from going rogue and placed under the leadership of [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]]. On their first mission Ragnarok and the Dark Avengers were sent to the new nation of [[Sharzhad]].{{r|Dark Avengers #175}}

| Powers                  = Much like the original Thor, the Thor clone's strength, endurance and resistance to injury are greater than the vast majority of his superhuman race and most superhumans. He is immune to conventional disease and nearly invulnerable to injury. His flesh and bones are several times denser than a human's. However he wasn't anywhere near as powerful or as strong as the original [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] and only possessed a portion of his power and strength. While the real Thor was at the very least an equal to [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] in hand-to-hand combat and clearly superior when using his hammer, Hercules defeated the Thor Clone and crushed his head with his own hammer although the clone was able to do surprisingly well against Hercules and held his own for a period of time.

Despite this, Ragnarok was still a force to be reckoned with, as he was able to effortlessly take on Storm, killed Goliath, and was taking on the entire Initiative and defeating them by himself.{{r|Avengers Assemble #1}}
