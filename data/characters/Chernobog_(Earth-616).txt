===Origins===
'''Chernobog the Black'''{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #2}} was the [[Dievas|Slavic god]] of chaos, night,{{r|Incredible Hulks #621|; A Quiet Night}} and darkness,{{r|Avengers Vol 8 10}} and one of the "evil soldiers" in the war between good and evil fought among the [[Russia]]n gods.{{r|Incredible Hulks #621|; A Quiet Night}}

===Early Years===
He was allegedly worshiped by the sick and the dying, and the witches and warlocks.{{r|Incredible Hulks #621|; A Quiet Night}}

In 893 AD, along the Banks of the [[Neva River]], he and [[Perun (Earth-616)|Perun]] were allegedly coming to help their [[Slavs]] worshipers against the Norsemen led by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], but were both killed by [[Gorr (God Butcher) (Earth-616)|Gorr the God Butcher]] (only Perun's blood and a beheaded Chernobog were witnessed),{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #2}} in an unnamed town.{{r|Incredible Hulks #621|; A Quiet Night}}<!-- It is unclear if both account of death are the same -->

===Modern Day===
<!-- happening after {{cl|Incredible Hulk #189}} -->In that very town, an unnamed bartender made a deal with him, serving as a host to manifest on the Earth plane, the bartender picking on the tourists he despised for disrepecting his country and not caring of its history, while Chernobog was free to "haunt" the streets, looking for people to feed on in order to gain energy and one day rejoin the war. Their link was seemingly working around a lamp.<!-- {{r|Incredible Hulks #621|; A Quiet Night}} -->

One day, he attacked tourists but was confronted to [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk (Bruce Banner)]], whom Chernobog proved unable to drain before overloading. Banner deduced the relation and confronted the bartender.{{r|Incredible Hulks #621|; A Quiet Night}}

In light of an increase of global tensions in the superhuman community, marked by the Avengers answering to [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|King T'Challa]] of [[Wakanda]] and the formation of the [[Defenders of the Deep (Earth-616)|Defenders of the Deep]] by [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] to drive off human presence in the oceans, a mission that included the attack of Russian submarines in the [[Black Sea]], the Russian government decided to revamp the Winter Guard. As part of the expanded roster, Chernobog joined the Winter Guard. Chernobog shared ranks with another Slavic deity, the god of storm [[Perun (Earth-616)|Perun]]. During one of their earliest missions, Chernobog and Perun came to blows since neither wanted the other to claim the chance to deal Namor the final blow during battle.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 10}} Following this episode, both Chernobog and Perun appeared to have been removed from the team.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 32}}

| Powers                  = Chernobog was allegedly the "strongest one there was". He could feed on the "souls" of mortals, or rather energies. He also used a mortal host to manifest himself in the Earth plane.{{r|Incredible Hulks #621|; A Quiet Night}}
| Abilities               = 
| Strength                = 
| Weaknesses              = Chernobog could not withstand tremendous amounts of energies, such as the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]'s.{{r|Incredible Hulks #621|; A Quiet Night}}

| Equipment               = 
| Transportation          = 
| Weapons                 = Chernobog rode a winged stallion.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #2}}

| Notes                   = 

* Even saying his name was considered bad luck.{{r|Incredible Hulks #621|; A Quiet Night}}

| Trivia                  = 

* "Chernobog" means Black God in English.
* Chernobog's overall appearance bears a striking resemblance to the similarly named "[[disney:Chernabog|Chern'''a'''bog]]" from the 1940 animated film ''[[disney:Fantasia|Fantasia]]'' by Marvel's parent company Disney.
