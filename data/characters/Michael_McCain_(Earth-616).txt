===Mutant Liberation Front===
Forearm was one of the founding members of the terrorist organization known as the [[Mutant Liberation Front (Earth-616)|Mutant Liberation Front]] (or MLF). One of their first missions under the leadership of [[Nathaniel Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]] was to liberate the incarcerated [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] members [[Russell Collins (Earth-616)|Rusty]] and [[Sally Blevins (Earth-616)|Skids]]. They broke them out of prison and the pair joined the MLF out of confusion (and, as later evidence showed, neural implants kept them there).{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 87}} Forearm continued to be a mainstay in the team's ventures, including fighting [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] and other heroes.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 77|78}}

Under the leadership of [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], the New Mutants became the paramilitary organization known as [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] and began to be more aggressive in their campaigns. In one such mission X-Force discovered a hidden MLF base and, while fighting Forearm, [[Pantu Hurageb (Earth-616)|Reaper]] and other members of the team nearly lost their lives when Stryfe ordered the destruction of the base.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 1}}

Later, [[Garrison Kane (Earth-616)|Garrison Kane]] stumbled upon Forearm, [[Richard Gill (Earth-616)|Wildside]], and [[Jun Tenta (Earth-616)|Sumo]] in the Canadian mountains and, after a brief scuffle, followed them through their teleportation portal, where he was tortured.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 10}}

After a series of supposedly unconnected art thefts (all of which were related to [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]]), Forearm and Reaper approached [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] on behalf of Stryfe and proposed a trade. In exchange for a genetic matrix (none other than the [[Legacy Virus]] which Stryfe owned), Sinister handed over the captive [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]]. In the end, all of the MLF members were taken into custody.{{Citation}}

====Reignfire's Leadership====
Soon after, a tyrannical despot named [[Reignfire (Earth-616)|Reignfire]] decided to restart the MLF. He broke Forearm, Reaper, Wildside, and [[Heather Tucker (Earth-616)|Tempo]] out of prison and gave them their first mission: kill [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Peter Gyrich]]. The MLF also picked up new members [[Rayna Piper (Earth-616)|Locus]] and [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Moonstar]]. Their assassination attempt was foiled by X-Force. Locus and [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] become lost, but [[Maria Callasantos (Earth-616)|Feral]] defected to the MLF after having a heated discussion with Gyrich. The team left and was taught teamwork by Moonstar, as, at the time, their ranks were once again down to four--Moonstar, Wildside, Forearm, and Feral.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 26|28}} During this time Forearm and Moonstar began to form a close friendship, as she saw something in him that was different from the other members of the terrorist outfit. During the time Moonstar was part of the team, Forearm ended up battling forces from the other-dimensional realm of [[Asgard (Realm)|Asgard]]. They had appeared due to Moonstar's past history with the realm.{{r|X-Force and Cable Annual Vol 1 '97}}

Sometime later Reignfire began to hunt down his followers, taking Wildside and Forearm out first. All would have been lost if not for X-Force and Locus teleporting in to stop Reignfire.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 43}}

===Legacy Virus Data===
Next, the MLF traveled to [[Muir Island]] where they meant to steal the [[Legacy Virus]] data from [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggert]]. While there, they learned about the [[Xavier Protocols]], and decided to try and steal them. They were confronted by members of the super-team [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]]. If not for the covert efforts of Moonstar, the mission would have been a success, but instead the team teleported away.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 104|105}}

The MLF once again tried to steal data on the Legacy Virus, this time from a government institution who was trying to manufacture their own strain of the disease. They infiltrated the building and took the scientists hostage. Again, through the sabotaging efforts of Moonstar, members of X-Force managed to enter the building in an attempt to stop them. However, three of the scientists revealed themselves to be [[Prime Sentinels (Earth-616)|Prime Sentinels]] and attacked. The two groups pooled their resources, but only X-Force, Moonstar, and Forearm managed to escape. The remaining members of the MLF were captured by operatives of Operation: Zero Tolerance. During their time together, Moonstar revealed to him that she had been an undercover agent for [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] meant to infiltrate the organization and feed the government information. Feeling betrayed, Forearm parted ways with the team.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 67|69}}

===Death, Resurrection, and Depowering===
When he surfaced next Forearm was part of a fighting championship in [[Madripoor]] called [[Bloodsport (Event)|Bloodsport]] where superpowered opponents fought to the death. However, in an unfortunate turn of events, Forearm was killed during a fight with former [[Serpent Society (Earth-616)|Serpent Society]] member [[Blanche Sitznski (Earth-616)|Anaconda]], who broke his neck.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 167}} However, he would later appear inexplicably, alive and well, again as a member of the MLF.{{r|X-Force Vol 2 4|6}}

In the events of [[M-Day]], most of the world's mutant population lost their powers due to the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]. Forearm was among them.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 18}}

===Back with the MLF===
Under unknown circumstances, Forearm regained his mutant powers and reunited with the Mutant Liberation Front. The team first attacked Fairview Medical Labs, blasting the [[X-Men Blackbird]] down from the sky and injuring several students. While battling [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]], Forearm revealed the laboratory was manufacturing a vaccine to wipe out the mutant gene. [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] intervened, with [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] slashing the members of the MLF into defeat.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 1}}

Forearm and the MLF, now led by [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], later ambushed the X-Men. Forearm was defeated by [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]] and taken into custody by [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] posing as [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 15|16}}

===House of X===
Forearm was eventually welcomed to the new mutant island of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], created by Xavier, Magneto, and [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira X]]. He entered through the teleportation gateway alongside other villainous and fractious mutants, who had been invited to join the nation in order to heal mutantdom and start over as a whole species together.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}

Forearm would eventually join [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] security division,{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 5}} and [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]]'s [[Dark Riders (Krakoa) (Earth-616)|Dark Riders]].{{r|X-Men: Curse of the Man-Thing Vol 1 1}}

A group of [[Mutant Liberation Front (Earth-616)|MLF]] members including [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Moonstar]], [[Tamara Kurtz (Earth-616)|Dragoness]], Forearm, [[Rayna Piper (Earth-616)|Locus]], [[Heather Tucker (Earth-616)|Tempo]], and [[Richard Gill (Earth-616)|Wildside]] were stated to include '''Alpha Class Mutants'''.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 67}} It is unknown if all or only part of them were included in the statement, or if it was even a true statement and not a pretext for [[Operation: Zero Tolerance (Earth-616)|Operation: Zero Tolerance]] to step in.
