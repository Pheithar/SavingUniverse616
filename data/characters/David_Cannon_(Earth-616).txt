===Early Life===
[[File:David Cannon (Earth-616) from Tales to Astonish Vol 1 50 003.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Causing trouble as a child.]]
David Cannon was born a [[Homo superior|mutant]] with the ability to move his body at great speeds. As a child in [[Kansas City]], [[Missouri (State)|Missouri]], he learned that he never became dizzy, and could make himself nearly untouchable by spinning in a tight circle like a top. He used his natural abilities first as a bully, and during his teens, as a petty criminal. He later found legitimate employment as a circus performer, a professional wrestler, and finally an ice-skating competitor. His talents were noticed by small-time criminals that operated a betting syndicate, and soon he was fixing races for them. When the criminals warned him of possible police investigation, Cannon scoffed and decided to use his talent for crime flamboyantly.{{r|Tales to Astonish #50}}

===Human Top===
[[File:David Cannon (Earth-616) from Tales to Astonish Vol 1 55 001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Human Top Costume]] Designing himself a costume, Cannon dubbed himself the Human Top and embarked upon a series of heists of jewelry and department stores. Dr. [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]], then known as Giant-Man read of the Human Top's exploits and decided to bring him to justice. Pym believed that stopping the Top was beneath his abilities. However when his ants reported that the Human Top intended to rob the Danly's Department store, the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] convinced him to do something about it. When the Top attempted to rob the department store, Giant-Man went into action to try and stop him. However the gigantic hero proved no match for the Top's speed and his larger size proved to be more of a detriment and the Human Top managed to escape.{{r|Tales to Astonish #50}} 

[[File:David Cannon (Earth-616) from Tales to Astonish Vol 1 50 002.jpg|left|thumb|200px]]
Giant-Man then began training to try and stop the Human Top when he next resurfaced trying to increase his speed through improvements in his growth serum as well as physical training. Ultimately, Giant-Man realized that intelligence was the only way to defeat the Human Top when he managed to steal top secret plans. With the help of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], they intercepted some spies who were seeking to buy the plans from the Top. When the Human Top attempted to make the delivery, Giant-Man was waiting in the spy's place. When the Top attempted to escape, he found that the authorities had fenced off the entire neighborhood and Giant-Man soon captured him and turned him over to the authorities.{{r|Tales to Astonish #51}}

[[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] met and defeated the Human Top with a blow to the head. With his last conscious thought, the speedster states that he needs to add a helmet.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #37}}

Not long after this the Human Top escaped from prison again and sought to get revenge against his foes. He followed Giant-Man and the Wasp back to their headquarters where he managed to succeed in obtaining some of Giant-Man's growing pills. Despite his increased size, the Human Top was defeated by Giant-Man and the Wasp, restored to his normal size, and incarcerated once again.{{r|Tales to Astonish #55}} At one point attempting to manipulate the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] into attacking Pym.{{r|Tales to Astonish #59}} Then, he redesigned his costume to enable him to fly for short distances and kidnapped the Wasp in order to lure Pym into a trap. Pym still managed to thwart him and turned him over to the authorities.{{r|Tales to Astonish #68|69}}

He was among the many costumed menaces assembled by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] to disrupt the wedding of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] and [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Susan Storm]].{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #3}}

===Whirlwind===
After serving a prison term, Cannon settled in lower [[Manhattan]] and refrained from criminal activity for a time, practicing new fighting techniques using his spinning ability. Hoping to make a fresh start in his criminal career, he devised himself a new costume and renamed himself Whirlwind. He sought revenge upon Pym and the Wasp for the humiliating defeats he suffered at their hands but decided to proceed patiently. Creating the false identity of '''Charles Matthews''', he acquired a portfolio of false credentials and was hired by Janet van Dyne, the Wasp, as her chauffeur. Thus gaining access to the [[Avengers Mansion]] garage, he broke into the mansion and trapped Pym and the Wasp inside an ant colony Pym was studying, then planted a time bomb nearby. Pym managed to escape however and warn the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] about the bomb. Whirlwind fled the mansion, managing to elude the grasp of [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], also a superhumanly fast mutant.{{r|Avengers #46}}

===Masters of Evil II===
Whirlwind accepted the invitation of the Crimson Cowl (revealed to be [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron-5]]) to join [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Klaw]], the [[Chen Lu (Earth-616)|Radioactive Man]], and the Melter in the second Masters of Evil. The Masters ambushed and took the Avengers hostage, but the Avengers escaped. All the Masters were apprehended except Ultron and Whirlwind.{{r|Avengers #54|55}} Whirlwind briefly reunited with Klaw, Melter, and Radioactive Man as the Masters in Rutland, [[Vermont (State)|Vermont]].{{r|Avengers #83}} 

===Batroc's Brigade===
Whirlwind teamed with [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc]] and [[Alexander Gentry (Earth-616)|Porcupine]] on a mission for "The Hood" (actually an LMD of [[Wolfgang von Strucker (LMD) (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]]),{{r|Captain America #130}} and then rejoined with some of the Masters of Evil for a minor skirmish with the Avengers in Vermont. He finally got another chance at revenge upon Pym when Pym was trapped at ant size, but he did not succeed in killing his old enemy.{{r|Captain America #132}}

===Charles Matthews===
Whirlwind remained undercover as Janet van Dyne's chauffeur "Charles Matthews" for several years, trying to devise a foolproof scheme to steal the van Dyne fortune.{{r|Avengers #46}} He also tried, though unsuccessful, to initiate a relationship with the already married Janet. Her multiple rejections made him attack the team more, also causing him to begin a strange fixation with her. Whirlwind's chauffeur identity was finally exposed during a battle with Yellowjacket when Whirlwind showed knowledge of Pym's new disruptor gun that only the Avengers and Charles had seen before.{{r|Marvel Feature #6}}{{r|Avengers #139|140}}

===Vision===
Whirlwind used his know-how to turn a pack of cigarettes into a bomb that blew open a hole in his cell allowing for him to escape and plot revenge against the Avengers once more. The ruckus caused by Whirlwind's escape alerted the Vision to the situation. When Whirlwind attempted to attack the Vision, the android easily defeats him by utilizing his density powers and his solar energy weapons.{{r|Avengers Annual #6}}

===Lethal Legion I===
After that, Whirlwind restricted himself to group efforts once more. He joined with the [[Arthur Parks (Earth-616|Living Laser]] and the original [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Power Man]] to work as [[Luchino Nefaria (Earth-616)|Count Nefaria]]'s henchmen, and was sent to jail after a clash with the Avengers.{{r|Avengers #164}} Count Nefaria used the Legion to give himself their powers.{{r|Avengers #165}}

===Defenders===
Whirlwind was recruited into a criminal version of the [[Defenders (Villains) (Earth-616)|Defenders]].{{r|Defenders #63|65}}

===Masters of Evil III===
He was freed from jail by [[Elihas Starr (Earth-616)|Egghead]], who wanted Whirlwind to join his Masters of Evil. Somewhat stir crazy from the confinement, Whirlwind disobeyed Egghead and prematurely attacked the Avengers to get revenge on the Wasp, leading the Masters to an early defeat.{{r|Avengers #222}} 

===Iron Fist===
He managed to escape, however, and months later, at his high school reunion, encountered [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]] and managed to leave the scene unscathed.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #106}}

===Masters of Evil IV===
When [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Helmut Zemo]] was organizing his Masters of Evil, Whirlwind petitioned to join. But Zemo, perhaps hearing of how he was a deficit to the previous Masters, assigned Whirlwind the task of detaining Captain America, rather than joining in the main force that was going to take over Avengers Mansion. Whirlwind realized the slight, however, and was determined to prove his worth to the group. He contacted the Tinkerer, one of the underworld's major armorers, and had him create some weaponry for Whirlwind to use; whirling wrist-mounted saw blades. Whirlwind then joined forces with the [[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Trapster]], who also hoped to better his reputation, and the two set a road trap for Captain America. Unfortunately, Captain America outsmarted them, and they were both taken into custody.{{r|Captain America #324}}

Whirlwind escaped shortly thereafter and traveled to [[San Francisco]] to rendezvous with [[Tiger Shark]], who had learned of a valuable piece of technology located there, while he was with the Masters of Evil at Avengers Mansion. Both Tiger Shark and Whirlwind were apprehended by [[Greer Nelson (Earth-616)|Tigra]], [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]], and Henry Pym while trying to procure it.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #16}}

===Bambi Arbogast===
Iron Man and Whirlwind fought in the skies outside Stark Industries. Their fight caused them to crash through the window of Tony Stark's personnel office. A secretarial applicant named [[Bambina Arbogast (Earth-616)|Bambi Arbogast]] rushed in and began organizing all of the papers that were strewn around during the fight. She distracted Whirlwind by telling him that there was an important telephone call for him. While Whirlwind's head was turned, Iron Man had the opportunity to knock him out. Arbogast's brave assistance landed her the job as Tony Stark's personal secretary.{{r|Iron Man Annual #11}}

===Daughters of the Dragon===
Whirlwind, [[Jeff Hagees (Earth-616)|8-Ball]], [[Buchanan Mitty (Earth-616)|Humbug]], and [[Jack Croft (Earth-616)|Freezer Burn]] skipped bail and teamed up to rob the penthouse apartment of a wealthy publisher, but got more than they bargained for. [[Daughters of the Dragon (Earth-616)|Daughters of the Dragon]], [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]], were on the case.{{r|Daughters of the Dragon #1}}

===Long Way Down===
[[File:David Cannon (Earth-616) from Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 513.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
Returning to his life of crime, David was upgraded and employed by [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]] along other villains of Iron Man in Mandarin's vengeance against the hero.{{r|Invincible Iron Man #513}} He fought Iron Man in the Wilmington Oil Field and later took part in the battle against [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]], in which the hero faked his own death to help Tony Stark in a plan to defeat the Mandarin.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 514}}

Due to the Mandarin implanting a bomb in him as well as in the rest of the villains, Whirlwind decided to help Mandarin's prisoners, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and [[Ezekiel Stane (Earth-616)|Ezekiel Stane]] when they rebelled against the villain.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 524}} He, a new [[Blizzard (Jim) (Earth-616)|Blizzard]], and the Living Laser attacked the Mandarin's armories. During the assault, Whirlwind's enhancements were damaged, and he couldn't partake in the final showdown against the Mandarin and his [[Titanomech|Titanomechs]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 525}}

===Infinity===
Following the death of the Mandarin, Whirlwind returned to the usual business of robbing banks along with [[Donald Gill (Earth-616)|Blizzard]]. When the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] left Earth in order to battle the [[Builders (Race)|Builders]], he and Whirlwind were approached by [[Spymaster (Ted Calloway) (Earth-616)|Spymaster]], who offered them to join a group of villains of Iron Man who planned to assault the almost-defenseless [[Stark Tower]].{{r|Infinity: Heist #1}}

[[File:David Cannon (Earth-616) from Avengers X-Sanction Vol 1 1 001.png|left|200px|thumb]]
After Blizzard was revealed to be an [[Inhumans (Race)|Inhuman]] when [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] set off a Terrigen Bomb, Whirlwind supported him in his decision to leave Spymaster, but they were forced into taking part of the assault on [[Stark Tower]].{{r|Infinity: Heist #2}} Once there, Spymaster used teleporter discs to teleport some Iron Man Armors to his buyers, but he escaped and left Whirlwind and the rest of his accomplices to be discovered by the heroes which were using the tower as a base. They managed to defeat the heroes, and they were offered to be taken to Spymaster by Titanium Man. When they arrived to a spaceship where Spymaster was, they were ambushed by him and Titanium Man, who revealed himself as [[At-Lass (Earth-616)|Captain Atlas]] of the [[Kree]], the buyer.{{r|Infinity: Heist #3}}

They managed to escape custody and started fighting Spymaster, Titanium Man and the army of Iron Men, controlled by the first. The actual [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] arrived to the spaceship, after having tracked down the armors, and helped Whirlwind and his allies defeat the enemies. During the fight, Blizzard used the powers he discovered of being like a human battery to overcharge the armors and deactivate them, but he fainted and fell of the spaceship's cargo door. A suit Iron Man was controlling rescued him, but in order to let his friends escape, Blizzard froze himself and the suit.{{r|Infinity: Heist #4}}

===Pleasant Hill===
At some point, Cannon was caught by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and sent to their new secret prison known as [[Pleasant Hill]], were they used [[Cosmic Cube]] fragments to transform criminals into model American citizens. Whirlwind was transformed into a teenager known as Scotty, and was good friends with an ice cream vendor named Harold. One day, Scotty came to Harold to tease him about his dance with Sheriff Eva, whom Harold had a crush on. But in that moment, [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] started an uprising against S.H.I.E.L.D. and the prisoners changed back to their real selves. Whirlwind and the [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]]--"Harold's" real self--went on a rampage in the town. But [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]] arrived to stop them from killing everyone, revealing herself to have been Sheriff Eva. Cannon saved Creel before Elektra could stab him, but he was so shaken by having his life twisted by S.H.I.E.L.D. that he was ready to surrender. But they were both rescued by Absorbing Man's wife [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]] and the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]], who had come to rescue Creel and took Whirlwind with them. The Hood latter offered both of them to join his [[Illuminati (Hood's) (Earth-616)|Illuminati]], which Whirlwind accepted.{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 6}}

===Ant-Man Security Solutions===
Whirlwind, along with [[Darla Deering (Earth-616)|Miss Thing]], [[Janice Lincoln (Earth-616)|Beetle]], [[Magician (Guardineer) (Earth-616)|Magician]], [[Jason Cragg (Earth-616)|The Voice]], and [[Hijacker (Mercenary) (Earth-616)|Hijacker]], recently joined [[Ant-Man Security Solutions (Earth-616)|Ant-Man Security Solutions]].{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 9}} However, after Cannon helped [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] infiltrate [[Cross Technological Enterprises (Earth-616)|Cross offices]], he chose to depart with ill-gotten gains rather than help Ant-Man.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 10}}

===Aiding A.I.M.===
With news of Pymtron (Ultron Pym) returning to infect the world after his plaguing alien worlds, [[Monica Rappaccini (Earth-616)|Monica Rappaccini]] convinced Cannon that Janet Van Dyne's continued affection for her dead husband was a machination by the long time villain. Once hired by A.I.M. after learning this, Cannon sought out Janet and locked her in an enclosed room sealed off while Rappaccini 'drafted' the young scientists at the G.I.R.L. Expo. His attempts at swaying her fail and Janet beats him into unconsciousness, then hurting him more, Janet warns Cannon not to threaten the girls under her care or else his life would be made into a living hell.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 2 8|10}}

===[[Sins Rising]]===
Whirlwind rejoined the Lethal Legion when Count Nefaria reassembled the team to help him find a new source of power in the [[Catalyst (Item)|Catalyst]], a device created by [[Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. (Earth-616)|Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S]]. After raiding the [[Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Facility]] to kill the scientist who discovered it and prevent his knowledge from being shared to anybody else,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 41}} the Lethal Legion attacked a public demonstration for the Catalyst taking place at the [[Empire State University]]. The attack was interrupted by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], but he was overpowered by the villains.

The Lethal Legion was ultimately stopped by the vicious vigilante [[Stanley Carter (Earth-616)|Sin-Eater]], who shot each member of the Legion and Nefaria. However, due to his new supernatural nature, when the Sin-Eater killed the Letha; Legion, he also stole their powers. This process also returned Cannon and the rest of the villains back to life, filled with a new-found sense of repentance for their crimes. They were all transferred to the [[Ravencroft Institute]], where they became model patients.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 46}} After the "sins" accumulated by the Sin-Eater were transferred into the [[Order of the Web (Earth-616)|Order of the Web]]{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 50}} and then they were expunged from this corruption,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 52}} they went back to their original hosts, causing Whirlwind to regain his powers and return to his normal self.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 56}}

When the Sin-Eater's master, the demonic [[Kindred]] twins, enacted their final attack against Spider-Man, they used their powers to pull into their service an army of super villains, including the Whirlwind, due to his involvement in the Sin-Eater's rampage. They participated in a battle royale for Spider-Man's head until [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] freed himself and the other contestants from the Kindreds' control.{{r|Sinister War Vol 1 3}}

| Powers                  = '''Bodily Rotation''': Whirlwind is a [[mutant]] who possesses the ability to rotate his body around its lengthwise axis at superhuman speeds. He can spin as fast as 400 revolutions per minute, and still speak, hear, and see his environment while spinning. Virtually nothing can touch him; most people and objects are repelled by the centrifugal force if they try to impede his motion.{{r|Dark Reign Files #1}}
**'''Superhuman Speed''': His spinning ability makes it possible for him to move along the ground in any direction at superhuman speeds. He can travel at up to 50 miles per hour in a straight line for 30 minutes without tiring appreciably. While spinning, Whirlwind cannot be touched or caught due to the tremendous angular momentum created by his rotation. His agility and maneuverability are such that he can usually twist and turn to avoid any obstacles.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #6}}
**'''Superhuman Balance''': Whirlwind's sense of balance is no longer determined by his inner ears' semi-circular canals, but seems to be derived from his sight, this allows him to maintain his equilibrium at all times, making him immune to vertigo or common dizziness.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #14}}
**'''Superhuman Reflexes''': His reflexes and reaction time is near-instantaneous, making him fast enough that he can, while spinning, pick up objects, change his clothes, or punch an attacker.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #8}}
**'''Altered Physiology''': Even though Whirlwind does appear to be human, his physiology isn't normal because of his body adapting to his abilities. Because of this, the body fluids within Cannon are thick as heavy oil and his organs are more thick and durable than normal human physiology.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #12}}
* Whirlwind has taught himself several applications of his spinning ability for combat.
** '''''Flight''''': He has taught himself, through concentration, to fly like a helicopter for up to 10 minutes reaching a top speed of up to 120 miles per hour.{{r|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}}
**'''''Force Field''''': He can create a windscreen to deflect matter as massive as a falling boulder.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #6}}
**'''''Partial Whirlwind''''': Instead of having his entire body spinning in a whirlwind, he could ride the whirlwind that his body made, leaving his upper body exposed.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #6}}
**'''''Surface Climbing''''': With sufficient momentum, he can spin up vertical surfaces.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #6}}
**'''''Tornado Creation''''': By rapidly spinning his arms, he could form small tornadoes that could be used against opponents. These miniature tornadoes are capable of sucking in or blowing away people and objects as large as auto mobiles.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #6}}
**'''''Wind Jet Stream''''': He can focus the air currents created by his spinning into a jet stream powerful enough to blast a hole through a brick wall.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #6}}

| Abilities               = After awhile, Whirlpool managed to manipulate his abilities and reflexes to where he could pick up any objects while spinning, quickly change in and out of clothes while spinning, and physically attack a person while spinning.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #4}}

| Strength                = Whirlwind possesses superhuman strength, particularly in his legs. While he can lift (press) approximately [[Strength Scale#Peak Human|1000 pounds]], he can leg-press approximately [[Strength Scale#1 Ton|2000 pounds]] under optimal conditions.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #4}}

| Weaknesses              = 

| Equipment               = 
| Transportation          = 
| Weapons                 = * '''Whirlwind Blades:''' Whirlwind employs two 10 inch diameter saw blades mounted on metal bracelets and driven by two DC servomotors each. Activated by switches on the palm, the twin blades spin at approximately 1600 revolutions per minute. Their hardened tool steel composition enables them to saw through virtually any substance softer than steel. When employed while Whirlwind spins, they are extremely deadly weapons. Whirlwind also employs shurikens (throwing stars) which he can propel at high velocities. He sometimes replaces them with other weapons that compliment his powers such as arm-blades.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #4}}

| Notes                   = * In {{cl|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 522}}, an exchange between Whirlwind and Titanium Man implied that both characters during "[[Long Way Down]]" and "[[Future (Story Arc)|The Future]]" were new bearers of their respective mantles. However, in {{cl|Infinity: Heist Vol 1 1}}, a comment by [[Firebrand (Amanda) (Earth-616)|Firebrand]], who was also involved in the aforementioned story arcs, directed at David implies that he was in fact the Whirlwind involved in those stories.
| Trivia                  = * Whirlwind was one of the [[198]] [[Mutants]] to survive [[M-Day]], when [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] used her powers to reduce the Mutant population.{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}}
* Whirlwind was accused of being a stalker of the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]], who he was so obsessed with that the Masters of Evil let him go so that he wouldn't ruin any of their plans when going up against the Avengers. Whirlwind denied these accusations but also seemed to confirm them unwittingly as he claimed to believe that the Wasp loved him and that they would someday be together and that other people just didn't understand.{{r|Daughters of the Dragon Vol 1 1}}
