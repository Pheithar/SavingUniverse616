===Origins===
Perun was one of the [[Dievas]], the Slavic gods of Eastern Europe, and was the god of storm, thunder and lightning, born in [[Iriys]], [[Svarga]], to [[Svarog (Earth-616)|Svarog]] and [[Lada (Earth-616)|Lada]].<!-- {{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #2|; Perun's entry}} -->

Svarog attributed shares of his power to his sons, but Perun and [[Svantovit (Earth-616)|Svantovit]] usurped their other brothers' share of powers to gain their father's favor, ultimately turning on each other, with Svarog refusing to involve himself.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #2|; Perun's entry}} Perun managed to obtain the largest share of power.{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; The [[Dievas]]' entry}}

===Early Years===
Perun prevented the [[ocean goddess]] [[Jurate (Earth-616)|Jurate]] from marrying a mortal, as she was betrothed to Perun's uncle [[Potrimpo (Earth-616)|Potrimpo]].<!-- {{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #2|; Perun's entry}} -->

He married with [[Saule (Earth-616)|Saule]]. When she was kidnapped by the death god [[Veles (Earth-616)|Veles)]], Perun chased him across the Earth, defeated him and returned him back to his realm of [[Vela]]/{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #2|; Perun's entry}}[[Virey]], despite Veles transforming into a dragon.{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; The [[Dievas]]' entry}}

He later seduced [[Ros (Earth-616)|Ros]] the river goddess, who bore him a son, [[Dazhbog (Earth-616)|Dazhbog]], who was destined to succeed to Perun as the lightning god.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #2|; Perun's entry}}

In 893 AD, along the Banks of the [[Neva River]], he and [[Chernobog (Earth-616)|Chernobog the Black]] were allegedly coming to help their [[Slavs]] worshipers against the Norsemen led by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], but were both killed by [[Gorr (God Butcher) (Earth-616)|Gorr the God Butcher]] (only Perun's blood and a beheaded Chernobog were witnessed).{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #2}}

===Christinanity===
In 980 AD, king [[Vladimir the Great]] converted to [[Christianity]], and hundred of oak statues sacred to Perun were thrown into the [[Dneiper River]]. The Dievas were forced back to [[Svarga]],{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #2|; Perun's entry}} as Svarog determined it was in the Dievas' best interest to return to their native realm and cut off most ties with the [[Earth]] realm.{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; The [[Dievas]]' entry}}

===Modern Day===
For reasons unknown, Perun was stripped of his godhood and bound to an amulet. That amulet was later found by Russian agent [[Valeri Soyloyev (Earth-616)|Valeri Soyloyev]] who used it to share his body with the headstrong deity, much to his distaste.{{r|Soviet Super Soldiers #1}}

Under unrevealed circumstances, Perun was drafted into working as an an agent of the Russian government, becoming their analogue to the Norse god [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] in the United States.{{r|Captain America #352}}

In light of an increase of global tensions in the superhuman community, marked by the Avengers answering to [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|King T'Challa]] of [[Wakanda]] and the formation of the [[Defenders of the Deep (Earth-616)|Defenders of the Deep]] by [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] to drive off human presence in the oceans, a mission that included the attack of Russian submarines in the [[Black Sea]], the Russian government decided to revamp the Winter Guard. As part of the expanded roster, Perun joined the Winter Guard. Perun shared ranks with another Slavic deity, the god of darkness [[Chernobog (Earth-616)|Chernobog]]. During one of their earliest missions, Perun and Chernobog came to blows since neither wanted the other to claim the chance to deal Namor the final blow during battle.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 10}} Following this episode, both Perun and Chernobog appeared to have been removed from the team.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 32}}

| Powers                  = Perun possesses various superhuman attributes common to the Russian gods.

*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Perun possesses vast superhuman strength of as yet unknown limit. However, he is one of the physically strongest of his race and can lift in excess of 100 tons.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 14}}
*'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Perun's musculature produces almost no fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting him nearly limitless physical stamina in all activities.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 14}}
*'''Superhumanly Dense Tissue:''' Perun's skin, muscle, and bone tissue has about 3 times the density of the same tissue in the body of a human being. This contributes, somewhat, to Perun's superhuman strength and weight.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 14}}
*'''Superhuman Durability:''' Perun's body is considerably harder and more resistant to physical injury than the body of a human being, or most other Russian gods for that matter. Perun is capable of withstanding great impact forces, high caliber bullets, exposure to temperature and pressure extremes, falls from great heights, and powerful energy blasts without sustaining injury.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 14}}
*'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Perun's reaction time is enhanced to a level that is beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 14}}
*'''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Despite his high resistance to injury, it is still possible to injure Perun. If injured, he is capable of rapidly regenerating damaged tissue with far greater speed and efficiency than a human being. However, he is unable to regenerate missing limbs or organs.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 14}}
*'''Extended Longevity:''' Although not immortal, Perun ages at a pace considerably slower than that of human beings. He is also immune to all known Earthly diseases and infections.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 14}}
*'''Energy Projection:''' Perun is capable of channeling great quantities of electrical energies and focus them through various weaponry that he carries as powerful bolts of destructive energy on a level equal to [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 14}}
