Proxima Midnight was a servant of [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] who she had served for an unknown number of years. She used to serve in Thanos' [[Butcher Squadron (Earth-616)|Butcher Squadron]], an elite team that carried out barbaric acts of murder that Thanos ordered carried out without question.{{r|Thanos Vol 3 1}}

===Invading Earth===
Years later, Proxima Midnight was a member of Thanos' [[Black Order (Earth-616)|Black Order]], and one of the best combatants of the Mad Titan's army. When Thanos targeted [[Earth]] as the next planet he would raze, Proxima Midnight was dispatched to [[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantis]] to retrieve [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]]'s [[Power Stone|Infinity Gem]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 8}} But first she would opt to (literally) make landfall in the heart of New York City after the Avengers' main team went off to battle against the [[Builders (Race)|Builders]] in space, in order to make way for the decimation of Earth as a tribute to her dark master. Taking a contingent of Thanos's army where she would proceed to lay waste to the city and its denizens, eventually coming into conflict with [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] and the latest incarnation of the [[Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]].{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 2}}

While in pitched battle with the motley crew stand in for Earth's protectors, Midnight managed to incapacitate the group's leader, [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Spectrum]] by lancing her with a fatal anti-photon charge, crippling her light form, then proceeding to pummel Cage into the ground with force and fury. Assured of her own victory, Proxima would soon find resistance in the local civilian bystanders who kept chanting the words 'Avengers Assemble', when she made a move towards them in an irate rage she was stopped by a roused Cage who fought her to a standstill. Just as Thanos projected towards her location in Times Square, voicing his disappointment in her failings as [[Ebony Maw (Earth-616)|Ebony Maw]] proceeded with his own particular end game Incensed she gets in one last sucker punch On Luke before departing. Finding Atlantis in rubble and Namor devastated, Proxima deduced that Namor did not have the gem in his possession. She made clear her intentions to kill him and destroy Atlantis to Namor, and offered to spare him and his nation in exchange for the location of the gem. Namor pledged her his and Atlantis' allegiance and told her that she could find the gem in [[Wakanda]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 9}}

After her fellow Black Order member [[Black Dwarf (Earth-616)|Black Dwarf]] failed to break Wakanda, Proxima, [[Corvus Glaive (Earth-616)|Corvus Glaive]] and Thanos himself departed for Wakanda, defeating its defenders and breaching their city wall. They narrowed down the potential location of the gem to the [[Necropolis]], the secret base of the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 11}} When Ebony Maw located Thanos' son, [[Thane (Earth-616)|Thane]], in [[Greenland]], the Black Order departed to said country.{{r|Infinity Vol 1 5}} Meanwhile, Proxima sent [[Kaldera (Earth-616)|Kaldera]] to take care of the new [[Samuel Alexander (Earth-616)|Nova]] under Thanos' orders.{{r|Nova Vol 5 8}} When she failed her mission, Proxima sent her to the "Midnight Sphere," where she would be tortured as a punishment.{{r|Nova Vol 5 9}}

When the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] arrived in Greenland in order to defeat Thanos, Proxima Midnight was trapped by Thane in an amber construct along with Thanos, which left them in a state of "living death." The two were then taken to the Necropolis.{{r|Infinity Vol 1 6}}

===The Cabal===
Proxima along with Thanos and Corvus, who had regenerated in the amber construct, were freed from their prison by Namor, who had had a falling out with the Illuminati for destroying an Earth during an incursion, for the purpose of saving universes from the [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]] as the Illuminati had resolved to rather die than kill the Earths, and joined his [[Cabal (Namor's) (Earth-616)|Cabal]] to destroy an Earth during other incursion and spare both universes.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 23}}

===[[Time Runs Out]]===
Eight months after the formation of the Cabal, the Cabal had found some degree of legitimacy on Earth. The world stood by and allowed the Cabal to raze [[Wakanda]], and claim the ruins as their base of operations. The Cabal continued to protect the universe by destroying colliding Earths, but Namor had grown weary and disgusted with the Cabal's habit of engaging in wholesale slaughter of the colliding Earth's population, as opposed to simply planting the bomb and leaving.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 24}}

Namor, now willing to turn himself in for his crimes, devised a plan with the Illuminati to destroy the Cabal. A new incursion was on the horizon, one in which the incursive world had been ravaged by the [[Sidera Maris (Multiverse)|Sidera Maris]]. Namor would lead the Cabal to said world, activate the anti-matter injector without their knowledge, and leave them to die with said Earth, preventing them from escaping with the use of an A.I.M. platform capable of creating an impenetrable barrier between the two colliding Earths. As the Cabal engaged the Sidera Maris in combat, Namor set his plan in motion. However, he was betrayed by Black Panther and Black Bolt, who pushed him off the platform into the soon-to-be-destroyed Earth.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 40}}

As the Cabal approached the fallen Namor, who lied about his intentions, they discovered an unusual event was occurring. The Earth they were in was, in addition, in an incursion with another universe at the same time. Unable to return to Earth-616, the Cabal made their way to the second incursion point, and escaped from the doomed planet into the third universe, the [[Earth-1610|Ultimate Universe]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 41}}

The Cabal allied themselves with the [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]], and began preparing with him for the eventual end of everything.  Anticipating that the final incursion would take place between their world and the Maker's, they ensured [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-1610)|Nick Fury]] would rally his world to fight theirs, buying them enough time to complete their [[Future Foundation's Life Raft|life raft]], which would enable them to survive the end of the [[Multiverse]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 44}}

===Battleworld===
As the final incursion raged, the Cabal were hard at work putting the finishing touches on their life raft, a device designed to allow them to survive the end of the Multiverse, based on the designs of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]]. During the battle between Earth-1610 and Earth-616, the Maker used his [[Children of Tomorrow (Earth-1610)|Children of Tomorrow]] to buy additional time for the Cabal to complete their work. They were able to finish their craft before the incursion ended, allowing them to live past the end of everything.{{r|Secret Wars #1}}

[[File:Cabal (Namor's) (Earth-616) from Secret Wars Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|right|The Cabal awaken on Battleworld]]
Eight years after the end of the Multiverse, the Cabal's life raft was unearthed on [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]], a patchwork planet created from the remains of several universes by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]. As they emerged, they killed a [[Thor Odinson (Thor Corps) (Earth-15513)|Thor]], one of the peacekeepers of Battleworld, and learned the name of the world they were on from a local.{{r|Secret Wars #2}}

The Cabal began wandering the wasteland of [[Utopolis]] where they had awoken, making camp to rest and plot a course. While resting, they were attacked by an army of [[Thor Corps (Earth-15513)|Thors]] who had come to bring them to justice. The Cabal were more than capable of holding their own against the Thors; however, prompting [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Sheriff Strange]] to intervene, along with the surviving heroes of Earth-616 who had escaped the end of the Multiverse in their own life raft. The heroes and the Cabal clashed, and when God Emperor Doom himself arrived, Stephen used magic to disperse all those present and scatter them around Battleworld.{{r|Secret Wars #3}} Several weeks later, Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive were found by [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-51518)|Apocalypse]] in [[Domain of Apocalypse|his domain]]. They were contained and brought to Castle Doom, where they were kept in stasis tubes and had their minds probed for information about them and the other survivors.{{r|Secret Wars #6}}

===Quest for Mjolnir===
Proxima was returned to Earth-616 when the Multiverse was restored to its proper state by [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] after Rabum Alal was defeated.{{r|Secret Wars #9}} She served as the tip of her husband's spear in [[Black Order (Corvus Glaive's) (Earth-616)|his Black Order]],{{r|Black Order #1}} but returned to work for Thanos after he killed Corvus.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 1}} When a mysterious cloaked figure wanted to curry favor with Thanos by bring him an alternate reality Mjolnir as a tribute,{{r|Unworthy Thor Vol 1 2}} she, the cloaked figure, and [[Yabbat Ummon Turru (Earth-1365)|Black Swan]] snuck aboard the ship of the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]], who was in possession of the Mjolnir, to steal the hammer from him. The villains unexpectedly encountered [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] (who was going by the name of Odinson) and [[Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616)|Beta Ray Bill]]{{r|Unworthy Thor Vol 1 3}} who had been captured by the Collector after they attempted to get back the City of Asgard and take the hammer from the Collector.{{r|Unworthy Thor Vol 1 2}}

Thor had already knocked out Bill after undergoing the Warrior's Madness. Thor himself was then knocked out by Proxima and Black Swan so they could take Bill's hammer [[Stormbreaker]]. The cloaked figure, however, told them that Stormbreaker wasn't their target. So, Proxima and her companions continued their search of the Collector's ship and eventually found the City of Asgard where the hammer was located. Proxima and her companions attacked the Collector but were repulsed by an energy blast from the Collector.{{r|Unworthy Thor Vol 1 3}}

Then Thor and his allies entered the fray leading to a three-way fight between the Black Order, Collector's side, and Thor's side.{{r|Unworthy Thor Vol 1 4}} Proxima and her companions were finally knocked out when Thor unleashed a blast of energy from the hammer. Thor then left with his allies, the hammer, and Asgard using the hammer's teleportation power. Proxima was forced to return to a now free Thanos empty-handed. When Thanos threatened the cloaked figure for failing to bring him a tribute, the figure decided to prove herself to Thanos by brutally killing Proxima with her own spear before revealing herself as the Asgardian death god [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]].{{r|Unworthy Thor Vol 1 5}}

===The Challenger's Contest===
Proxima Midnight was returned to life by the [[Challenger (Elder of the Universe) (Earth-616)|Challenger]] as part of his plan to reassemble the Black Order and have it fight the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]]'s [[Lethal Legion (Grandmaster) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 681}} The two teams were teleported to Earth in order to survey it, since the planet had been chosen as battleground. A fight broke between the competing teams, but was interrupted by the gamemasters since the contest was yet to begin. In preparation for the first round, the Black Order attacked the [[Avengers Mansion]] by surprise and blew it up.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 676}} The heroes managed to survive, however, having been teleported away from danger at the last second by [[Va Nee Gast (Earth-616)|Voyager]].

For the first round, the teams were divived in half to fight for each of the two [[Pyramoids]] deployed by the Grandmaster and the Challenger. Proxima was among the members of her team fighting in Cusco, [[Peru]], where they confronted one of the halves of the Lethal Legion.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 677}} A group of Avengers interrupted the fight,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 678}} with the round ending after the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] touched the Pyramoid. Meanwhile, the other Pyramoid had been claimed by [[Black Dwarf (Earth-616)|Black Dwarf]], scoring one point for the Black Order. The two people that touched the Pyramoids were teleported to the Grandmaster's Cosmic Game Room, though in a manner it seemed like they had been disintegrated.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 679}}

The following round, the Black Order in its entirety traveled to [[Antarctica]], where one of the new pair of Pyramoids had been activated.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 680}} Only Proxmia Midnight and Black Swan could retreat, since Ebony Maw had been knocked down, Corvus Glaive had been killed by [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], and [[Supergiant (Earth-616)|Supergiant]] incapacitated by [[Ferene (Earth-616)|Ferene]] of the Lethal Legion.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 681}} During the contest's final round, the last Pyramoid was teleported from its designated location to the [[Avengers Auxiliary Headquarters]] by the Grandmaster's secret agent, Voyager.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684}} Proxima Midnight and Black Swan followed the Challenger's own ace in the hole, the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], to the Pyramoid's new location,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 685}} but were defeated by the heroes left in the wake of Hulk's rampage.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 686}} Following the end of the contest and the Avengers' victory over the Challenger, the Black Order regrouped and escaped to the planet [[Angargal]], where they were approached by the Grandmaster with an offer.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 690}}

| Powers                  = '''Nigh-Invulnerability:'''{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 9}} Proxima Midnight was shown to be able to fall from space through Earth's atmosphere with no discomfort during landing and even while burning through planetary re-entry,{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 1}} she has also survived a confronting [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] receiving only minor wounds.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 2}}

'''Superhuman Strength:'''{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 9}} Proxima Midnight has incredible levels of physical strength, she has easily made [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] bleed and even cracked some of his ribs during their confrontation.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 2}}

'''Superhuman Speed'''{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 9}}

'''Superhuman Endurance:''' Proxima Midnight did not seem in the least concerned and showed no sign of suffering when [[Shuri (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] stabbed her shoulder with a spear causing her a big wound.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 11}}

It was created from a sun trapped in distorted space-time, acting and operating as a star, supernova, and black hole at once. Once thrown, it may become a lance of multi-arcing energy carrying the tremendous mass of its template sake. Proxima also suggested that she was able to exert control over its density. An arm which never misses its mark, it acts as a lethal projectile and may release a form of energy netting which turns jet black after ensnaring, weighing down, and effectively immobilizing a target. It must first hit a target to cause this effect. The lance also carries an incredibly lethal toxin with it upon contact, which can kill about anything be it flesh or even [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|living energy]] within moments.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 2}} The appellation was powerful enough to match and bind the immense strength of the Hulk, as well as revert him back into Bruce Banner once upon drawing it out of him.{{r|Infinity Vol 1 6}}
