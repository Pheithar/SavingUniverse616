| History                 = Bowman is Hydra's version of [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]].

| Trivia                  = It's said by a HYDRA member, that the cast of the HYDRA Four have all been genetically modified. Whether this means Bowman was genetically altered to be a marksman or not is not revealed

In the first panel that the HYDRA Four are introduced, we can see the silhouettes of Hammer, Militant, and Tactical Force, clearly outlined to look like their respective inspirations. The fourth member however is not wearing a Hawkeye uniform, and has a cape, striking the image as possibly a HYDRA version of Vision. This oversight is never explained or mentioned again
