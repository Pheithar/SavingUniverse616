| HistoryText             = The '''Rigellian Recorders''' are a race of sentient robots created by the [[Rigellians]] with the purpose of exploring new territory and reporting back to the Rigellians. Recorders are also used by various cosmic entities such as [[Recorder 211 (Earth-616)|Recorder 211]], who lived at [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu the Watcher]]'s home in the [[Blue Area of the Moon]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 136}} He recorded the events of the death of the X-Man, [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], whilst she was possessed by the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 137}}

[[Arthur Zix (Earth-616)|Recorder RT-Z9]] worked for the [[Living Tribunal (Multiverse)|Living Tribunal]]'s [[Magistrati (Multiverse)|Magistrati]], including [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]].{{r|She-Hulk Vol 1 7}}

Recorder 211 later accompanied the [[Asgardian]] hero [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] on a mission to the [[Black Galaxy]] to find [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego the Living Planet]]. The Recorder performed well gathering an unprecedented amount of rare data, including witnessing Thor's struggle against [[Mangog (Earth-616)|Mangog]], that the [[Rigellian Grand Commissioner (Earth-616)|Rigellian Grand Commissioner]] permitted it to retain its memories of the events rather then having them erased; it was arguing with the Asgardian that transcended his programming making him a sentient being.{{r|Thor Vol 1 132}}

Recorder 211 was later captured by the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] and reprogrammed and reconstructed as the Analyzer.{{r|Thor Vol 1 422}} 

Recorders also have a certain amount of legal authority among the Rigellians. When renegade commander [[Arcturus (Rigellian) (Earth-616)|Arcturus]] split his ships away from the main fleet, a Recorder tracked him and his followers to [[Luna (Moon)|Earth's Moon]], exposed the commander's crimes and had him arrested for several violations of Rigellian law.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 112}}
