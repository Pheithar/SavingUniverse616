He was [[Glossary:Mutate|mutated]] into a green behemoth, the living personification of rage, fueled by pure physical strength and would come to be known as nearly mindless "[[Incredible Hulk]]". Fearful of the damage that Hulk could inflict, as well as fleeing from the military, he went on the run.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 1}} He later found a home among the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], the Earth's Mightiest Heroes, for a short time.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 1}}

<center>''This is an abridged version of Bruce Banner's history. For a complete history see '''[[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)/Expanded History|Bruce Banner's Expanded History]]'''''</center>

===Early years===
[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616), Brian Banner (Earth-616), and Rebecca Banner (Earth-616) from Incredible Hulk Vol 1 603 001.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Bruce's [[Rebecca Banner (Earth-616)|mother]] killed by his [[Brian Banner (Earth-616)|father]] in blind fury]]
Robert Bruce Banner is the son of [[Brian Banner (Earth-616)|Dr. Brian Banner]], an atomic physicist, and his wife [[Rebecca Banner (Earth-616)|Rebecca]]. Although Rebecca deeply loved Bruce, who returned her affection, Brian hated their child and was driven by an insane jealousy of Bruce for being an object of Rebecca's love. Further, Brian believed that his radiation work had altered his DNA and given him a [[Homo superior|mutant]] son.{{r|World War Hulk: Gamma Files #1}} These factors led to Brian abusing Bruce physically. One of the people who helped Bruce cope with Brian's tantrums was his paternal cousin [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|Jennifer Walters]], with whom Bruce used to spend summers in the public library reading for hours, losing themselves to books.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 72}}

Bruce's life reached a turning point when Brian murdered Rebecca, and was placed in a mental hospital after being removed from his father's negative influence. After that, Bruce was raised by his aunt and father's sister, Susan Banner, who understood his great pain and rage over his childhood sufferings. Susan raised Bruce with love and care, as if he were her own child. Susan never wanted to deal with her brother after what he had done to Bruce and Rebecca. Bruce, grew up as a highly withdrawn, intellectually gifted youth, in fact, a child prodigy.{{r|[http://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Encyclopedia-DK-Publishing/dp/0756655307 ''Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe'', p.134]}} His fathers abuse caused Bruce to start to develop dissociative identity disorder which would go undiagnosed for years, partly due to the fact his D.I.D. was suppressed.{{r|Immortal Hulk #38}}

After fifteen years of confinement, the doctors believed that Brian was ready to rejoin society. Despite his reluctance, Bruce let his father temporarily stay with him. During this time, Brian began acting strange, causing tensions to escalate between the two. After Brian lashed out at his son, blaming him for his insanity, Bruce left to visit his mother's grave since it was the anniversary of her death. Brian followed him and started harassing Bruce, calling him a mutant and a monster. The confrontation quickly became physical, and Brian knocked Bruce down. While on the ground, Bruce pushed him back with his foot. Brian stumbled back and the impact of his head on Rebecca's gravestone killed him. Bruce blocked the memories of Brian's stay with him and his subsequent death, making himself believe that, as the two of them fought at Rebecca's grave, Brian had simply beat him and left, later being killed by muggers.{{r|Incredible Hulk #312}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #-1}}

===Education===
[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) and Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Indestructible Hulk Annual Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tony and Bruce at Oxford University]]
After graduating from Science High School, Bruce studied nuclear physics in [[Navapo]], [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]], at [[Desert State University]] as the star student of Professor [[Herbert Josiah Weller (Earth-616)|Herbert Josiah Weller]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #226}} He also studied for a time at [[Harvard University]].{{Citation}} He later transferred to [[Pennsylvania State University]] where he briefly worked with Canadian student [[Walter Langkowski (Earth-616)|Walter Langkowski]] finding a similar interest in gamma radiation.{{r|Incredible Hulk #313}}{{r|Alpha Flight #11}} He also worked with [[Peter Corbeau (Earth-616)|Peter Corbeau]], and [[Raoul Stoddard (Earth-616)|Raoul Stoddard]]. It was during his time at Penn State that Banner found inspiration from noted scientist [[Albert Einstein (Earth-616)|Albert Einstein]] and like the famous scientist, bought a wardrobe consisting entirely of purple suits.{{r|Incredible Hulk #367}} 

As a young student, Bruce first met another student with a brilliant mind; [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]. Ever since, they both attended [[Derenik Zadian (Earth-616)|Dr. Derenik Zadian]]'s "Forward Thought Conference" at [[Oxford University]]. This would lead to a life-long scientific rivalry between the two. They also became best friends. They eventually teamed up and joined the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Indestructible Hulk Annual Vol 1 1}}

Bruce obtained his doctorate in nuclear physics at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], alongside [[Philip Sterns (Earth-616)|Philip Sterns]], who later became [[Madman]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #367}} Eventually, as an adult and a genius in nuclear physics, Banner wished to pursue philanthropic brands of science, but couldn't receive any financial funding for his projects,{{r|Indestructible Hulk Annual #1}} and thus in lack of other options, went to work at a [[United States]] Defense Department nuclear research facility at [[Los Diablos Missile Base|Desert Base]], [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]]. There Banner met General [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Thaddeus E. "Thunderbolt" Ross]], the Air Force officer in command of the base, and his daughter [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Betty Ross]]. Banner and Betty eventually fell in love with each other. Banner designed and oversaw construction of the "[[Gamma Bomb]]" or "G-bomb," a nuclear weapon possessing a high gamma radiation output.{{r|Incredible Hulk #1}}

===Becoming the Hulk===
Banner was present in the instrumentation bunker at the test site for the first underground test detonation of the Gamma Bomb. Observing that a civilian had breached security and entered the restricted test area, Banner told his colleague [[Igor Drenkov (Earth-616)|Igor Starsky]] to delay the countdown while he tried to escort the civilian to safety. Starsky, secretly a Soviet agent, did nothing, confident that Banner would die in the explosion, bringing the project to a halt. Reaching the civilian, a teenager named [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]], Banner threw him into a protective trench.{{r|Incredible Hulk #1}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Incredible Hulk Vol 1 1 002.jpg|left|thumb|300px]]
Before Banner could get himself to safety, the Gamma Bomb detonated, and intense waves of radiation reached the surface. Banner was irradiated with highly charged radioactive particles. Bruce died, but the Gamma Bomb had created the first manifestation of a metaphysical barrier called the [[Green Door]] that connected Earth with the [[Below-Place]], the bottom layer of the [[Multiverse]]. The Green Door brought Bruce back to life, but the time span between his death and resurrection was so short, his death went unnoticed.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684}} The Gamma Bomb also caused Bruce to alter his body, causing him to frequently transform into the vastly powerful, grey-skinned, humanoid monster whom General Ross named "the Hulk."{{r|Incredible Hulk #1}}

At first Banner changed into the Hulk at sunset and reverted to human form at dawn. However, Banner's body eventually changed so that his transformations into the Hulk were triggered by the release of adrenaline when he became intensely excited or angry, no matter what time of day or night it was.

Usually the Hulk possessed little of Banner's memory and intelligence and was easily enraged. While the military attempted to contain the Hulk, he thwarted their every attempt, with Rick Jones, feeling responsible for Banner becoming the Hulk, trying to help keep him away from the military. The Hulk ultimately thwarted an attempt to destroy America by the [[Yuri Topolov (Earth-616)|Gargoyle]], another being mutated by gamma radiation. The Hulk changed back into Banner and help cure the Gargoyle, who helped Banner escape back to the U.S., where, with the help of Rick Jones, he maintained his identity as the Hulk a secret and attempted to keep the Hulk contained at night.{{r|Incredible Hulk #1}}

===Early adventures===
When Bruce next turned into the Hulk, his skin was green, a skin tone that remained the most constant for the Hulk. Banner became a target of the so-called [[Tribbitites|Toad Men]], who sought to invade Earth. Although at first their attempts to exploit Banner's intelligence made him appear to be a traitor to his country, Banner was able to use his might as the Hulk to thwart the Toad Men's invasion and thereby clear his name.{{r|Incredible Hulk #2}}

In an effort to control his transformations, Banner began using a [[Gamma Ray Projector]] to force transformations into the Hulk and Banner vice-versa; however his Hulk persona was reluctant to transform back into Banner.{{r|Incredible Hulk #2}} After the Hulk was shot into space and passing through a radiation storm Rick Jones briefly found himself able to control him. They worked together to stop the [[Circus of Crime (Earth-616)|Circus of Crime]]. Jones' control over the Hulk faded away. The Hulk's transformations were not limited to nightfall after this adventure.{{r|Incredible Hulk #3}}

[[File:Fantastic Four Vol 1 25 Vintage.jpg|left|thumb|The Hulk vs. the Thing!]]
The Hulk next foiled a hoax perpetrated by the Russian agent [[Boris Monguski (Earth-616)|Boris Monguski (Mongu)]] aimed at trying to learn the secrets of the Hulk's strength,{{r|Incredible Hulk #4}} saved Betty from the underground ruler [[Romulus Augustulus (Earth-616)|Tyrannus]], and battled the Chinese General Fang.{{r|Incredible Hulk #5}} When Gamma Base was the subject to sabotage, the Hulk was blamed and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] were called in to deal with him. This led to the first of many clashes between the Hulk and the Fantastic Four's [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]]. In the aftermath, the scientist [[Karl Kort (Earth-616)|Karl Kort]] was ultimately held responsible.{{r|Fantastic Four #12}} Shortly thereafter, the Hulk prevented [[Molyb (Earth-616)|Metal Master]] from invading Earth.{{r|Incredible Hulk #6}}

===[[Ultron Forever]]===
Hulk, along with other heroes from different time periods, were then abducted by [[Doombot (Avenger) (Earth-14831)|"Doctor Doom"]] from an [[Earth-14831|alternate future]] where [[Ultron (Earth-14831)|Ultron]] had successfully taken over the world. Doom asked the heroes to help him free the world from Ultron's control to which they complied. While [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] and [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] distracted the [[Avengers (A.I.) (Earth-14831)|A.I. Avengers]] Hulk, alongside [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] and [[Danielle Cage (Earth-15061)|Captain America]], infiltrated the [[Stark Tower (Columbus Circle, Rebuilt)|Avengers Tower]], but were ambushed by Ultron's [[Natalia Romanova (A.I.) (Earth-14831)|Black Widow]] and her [[Cyborgs|Bio-Slaves]], and managed to decapitate the Hulk using Captain America's [[Captain America's Shield|anti-gravity shield]].{{r|Avengers: Ultron Forever Vol 1 1}} Despite that, Hulk was able to survive that as Bruce's head emerged from the neck. Banner explained that he had done experiments to rid the Hulk from himself which might have caused further mutations. Banner then reattached Hulk's head to his body and the two heads began fighting the reactivated Bio-Slaves. As Ultron's factories began shutting down thanks to the heroes effort, Doom recalled them and revealed that he had taken over Ultron's system becoming the new ruler of the world. He tried to send the heroes to their respective time, but Thor managed to evade that and hide within this timeline.{{r|New Avengers: Ultron Forever Vol 1 1}} Arriving to [[Asgardia]] Doom sent billions of [[Ultron Sentinel]]s to attack them. They were hardly able to destroy one ship carrying the sentinels, as other ships arrived. Luckily, Iron Man managed to free the imprisoned [[Asgardians]] who then joined the battle. After that the heroes went to Doom who was revealed to have been a [[Doombot]] and was convinced by Vision to free the imprisoned humans and become their kind hearted leader. Afterwards, all of the heroes returned to their times.{{r|Uncanny Avengers: Ultron Forever Vol 1 1}}

===Sentry===
[[File:Sentry Hulk Vol 1 1.jpg|right|thumb]]
[[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|The Sentry]] met the Hulk and found that somehow his powers soothed the Hulk's raging temper. They were partners for a time, battling the Sentry's eternal enemy, the [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|Void]]. Eventually Sentry had to erase his existence from the minds of the world, and the Hulk forgot about his one-time partnership with the Sentry for many years.{{r|Sentry/Hulk #1}}

===Avengers===
The Hulk became a pawn of [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]], who tricked the Hulk into battling his half-brother, [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]. This plot was foiled, leading to the Hulk, Thor, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]], and the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] joining forces to form the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and defeat Loki.{{r|Avengers #1}} The Hulk was a founding member of the group and together they clashed with [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]].{{r|Avengers #1.5}} The group's mistrust in him became apparent when they were manipulated by the [[Space Phantom (Temporal Limbo)|Space Phantom]], and coupled with [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] in the form of a snake speaking lies to him,{{r|Avengers Vol 8 38}} prompted the Hulk to quit.{{r|Avengers #2}} The Avengers began hunting down their unpredictable former ally. The Hulk found an ally in the [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]], and clashed with the heroes, Thor in particular,{{r|Journey Into Mystery #112}} but the Hulk was defeated and disappeared in the water.{{r|Avengers #3}}

The Hulk soon resurfaced in [[New York City]] seeking revenge against the Avengers, clashing with them as well as the Fantastic Four, leading to a rematch with the Thing. The battle ended with Hulk being swept away in the New York harbor.{{r|Fantastic Four #25|26}} The Hulk resurfaced back in [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]], where he was tricked by the Avengers into aiding them in preventing the [[Lava Men]]'s attempt to eradicate human life on Earth's surface.{{r|Avengers #5}}

While hiding out in a cave near [[Hollywood]], the Hulk was disturbed when the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]]'s plot to use the [[Enforcers (Earth-616)|Enforcers]] to kill [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] encroached into his hiding spot, leading to a brief clash between the Hulk and Spider-Man before the Hulk fled the scene.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #14}} Later, the Hulk was manipulated into battling his former Avengers comrades, Giant-Man and the Wasp, by their enemy, the [[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Human Top]].{{r|Tales to Astonish #59}}

===Back at Gamma Base===
Banner continued his stint as a scientist at Gamma Base. Meanwhile, General Ross suspected Banner of being a spy and having some sort of connection with the Hulk. The base soon became the target of the [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]] who had been hired to steal a new experimental robot tank designed by Banner.{{r|Tales to Astonish #60}} Banner's attempt to stop the spy was complicated by the arrival of [[Glenn Talbot (Earth-616)|Lt. Glenn Talbot]], who shared General Ross' suspicions, at Gamma Base.{{r|Tales to Astonish #61|62}} When the military decided to move Banner and his tank to another base, the Chameleon's employer, the [[Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)|Leader]], deployed his [[Humanoid (Leader)|Humanoid]] to steal it. The Hulk battled the Humanoid and prevented it from stealing the device, but Banner himself was arrested by the military under suspicion of having something to do with this attempted theft.{{r|Tales to Astonish #62}} Banner remained a prisoner until Rick Jones revealed Banner's double identity to the [[President]] of the U.S., earning him a pardon.{{r|Tales to Astonish #63}}

Banner went to Astra Island with his new experimental Absorbatron device. The island was attacked by Leader's Humanoids, but Hulk defeated them.{{r|Tales to Astonish #63}} The battle ended with Banner being captured by Communist agents. Banner refused to work for the Communists and the Hulk freed himself and the other captured scientists.{{r|Tales to Astonish #64}} Thanks to the sacrifice of one of these scientists, the Hulk was able to fight his way out of Russia and ended up in [[Mongolia]].{{r|Tales to Astonish #65}} There Banner was picked up by thief [[Kanga Khan (Earth-616)|Kanga Khan]], who attempted to hold Banner for ransom for safe return to America. Glenn Talbot, believing him to be a traitor, was sent to retrieve Banner,{{r|Tales to Astonish #66}} but the Hulk left Talbot behind and returned to the U.S., where Banner was arrested.

Banner was again pardoned by the President and was allowed to return to Astra Island for another test.{{r|Tales to Astonish #67}} The Leader's Humanoids attacked again, and the Hulk and the Absorbatron were once again captured.{{r|Tales to Astonish #68}} Banner used one of the Leader's devices to bring the army to the site. By the time they arrived, Hulk had sent the Leader fleeing. The military drove the Hulk back, only to find a seemingly dead Banner when they searched the site of the battle.{{r|Tales to Astonish #69}}{{r|Avengers #17}}

Rick Jones stole Banner's body and attempted to revive him in his lab. Another bombardment with the Gamma Ray Projector triggered a transformation into the Hulk, but for the first time ever, Banner's mind possessed the Hulk. This came at a cost: if the Hulk ever reverted to Banner, he would die due to a shrapnel fragment lodged in his brain. The Leader showed the power of the stolen Absorbatron to potential buyers by sending a gigantic Humanoid to attack Gamma Base.{{r|Tales to Astonish #70}} The Hulk and Rick Jones were knocked away from the battle when General Ross fired his new "Sunday Punch" missile destroying the giant Humanoid. When the Hulk and Rick sought refuge in one of Banner's secret labs the military followed them. Banner sent Rick out to hold up the military during an air strike. The Leader teleported the Hulk away, seeking to form an alliance with him. The military assumed that their assault had atomized the Hulk.{{r|Tales to Astonish #71}}

The Hulk refused to ally himself with the Leader. Realizing something was wrong, the Leader bombarded him with more gamma radiation and removed the shrapnel from his brain. He then sent the Hulk to the [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Watcher]]'s home planet in order to steal the [[Ultimate Machine]].{{r|Tales to Astonish #73}} There the Hulk clashed with the [[Qnax (Earth-616)|Amphibion]], an alien who also sought the Ultimate Machine; after the Hulk had bested the Amphibion in combat, he was returned to Earth. The Leader took the Ultimate Machine from the Hulk and attempted to use the device. The Leader's plan backfired, as the machine seemingly killed him.{{r|Tales to Astonish #74}}

[[File:Tales to Astonish Vol 1 73.jpg|right|thumb|Hulk vs. [[Qnax (Earth-616)|Amphibion]]]]
Learning that Rick Jones was a prisoner of the military for refusing to reveal the Hulk's true identity, the Hulk attempted to seek a Presidential pardon for his friend. In [[Washington, D.C.]], he was ironically attacked by the last weapon Banner had invented for the military: the T-Ray.{{r|Tales to Astonish #75}} The T-Ray transported the Hulk to the distant future of [[Earth-6676]], a post-apocalyptic world ruled by [[Arrkam (Earth-6676)|King Arrkam]]. There, the Hulk battled his enforcer, the Executioner. Ultimately, the effects of the T-Ray wore off and the Hulk was returned to his native [[Earth-616]].{{r|Tales to Astonish #75}}

===Outed as the Hulk===
Rick Jones, believing Banner dead, revealed the Hulk's true identity to General Ross and Glenn Talbot.{{r|Tales to Astonish #76}} Learning that the Hulk was alive and well, Talbot hounded the Hulk again with Banner's replacement, [[Konrad Zaxon (Earth-616)|Konrad Zaxon]]. This prompted Rick to also tell Betty about Banner's double identity.{{r|Tales to Astonish #77}} Ultimately, the Hulk killed Zaxon for trying to use the Hulk as a battery for weapons he hoped to use to take over the Earth. The military chased after the Hulk, not knowing of Zaxon's true plans.

The Hulk, fleeing from [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], had a brief clash with [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]].{{r|Tales to Astonish #78}} Then, the Hulk was used as a pawn by Tyrannus who was then at war with another underground dweller, the [[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Mole Man]], over the [[Fountain of Youth]].{{r|Tales to Astonish #79}}{{r|Tales to Astonish #81}} Later, the Hulk was caught in the middle of the [[Secret Empire (Earth-616)|Secret Empire]] agent [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]]'s attempt to steal the new Orion missile, taking Betty as his prisoner. The Hulk managed to defeat Boomerang and then repeatedly battered him to an unrecognizable stoop saving Betty.{{r|Tales to Astonish #82}} The Hulk sought out the Avengers in [[New York]], only to be hounded by the authorities.{{r|Tales to Astonish #84}} While in New York, the Hulk was hounded by Spider-Man who sought to capture him in an attempt to earn membership in the Avengers, a mission in which he would fail due to his sympathy for the Hulk.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #3}}

Number One of the Empire attempted to use the [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]] to destroy the Hulk; however, this plot failed and Number One accidentally blew himself up. A spy for the Empire sent the Orion Missile off its testing course to impact with New York City.{{r|Tales to Astonish #85}} Banner redirected the missile to explode harmlessly in the ocean.{{r|Tales to Astonish #86}} Getting into a battle with the Leader's [[Hulk-Killer (Earth-616)|Hulk-Killer]] android, the Hulk eventually short circuited the Hulk-Killer, although Rick Jones was injured in the fight.{{r|Tales to Astonish #87}} For his part in stopping the Orion Missile from destroying New York, the Hulk was hailed as a hero and received a full Presidential pardon; however, the media frenzy frightened the Hulk off. The Hulk was attacked by Boomerang, seeking a rematch, seemingly ending in Boomerang's death.{{r|Tales to Astonish #88}}

===A Menace once more===
The [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]] attempted to use the Hulk to wipe out most of humanity hoping that the survivors would build a better world before leaving for the stars.{{r|Tales to Astonish #89}} Not wishing to be a menace, Banner attempted to kill himself with a powerful burst of gamma radiation. Banner was arrested by Glenn Talbot and locked up, leaving the spy [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Emil Blonsky]] to be mutated into the Abomination. The Hulk battled the Abomination, whom the Stranger found more useful to his goals.{{r|Tales to Astonish #91}}

The Hulk attempted to force the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] to take him into space.{{r|Tales to Astonish #93}} The Hulk was next captured by hunters in the employ of the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]]. The High Evolutionary attempted to advance Banner's evolution by ten million years to use him to keep his invading [[New Men]] at bay.{{r|Tales to Astonish #95}}

The Hulk was then tricked into helping the [[Lords of the Living Lightning (Earth-616)|Lords of the Living Lightning]] capture Gamma Base. The Hulk turned against them for threatening Betty and put an end to their organization. In the aftermath the Hulk was once again believed to be dead.{{r|Tales to Astonish #99}} The Hulk fell under the control of the [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]] who had him attack Rick, estranging him and the Hulk for a time, and then sent him after the Sub-Mariner. Coincidentally, this was at a time after Namor had been exiled from Atlantis and was seeking an alliance with the Hulk. The clash between the two ended in a giant tsunami that ruined the Puppet Master's base and reverted the Hulk to Bruce Banner. Not recognizing the Hulk in his human form, the Sub-Mariner returned to the sea.{{r|Tales to Astonish #100}}

[[File:Incredible Hulk Vol 1 103.jpg|right|250px|thumb]]
Loki once again attempted to use the Hulk as his pawn, transporting him to [[Asgard]], leading to a clash with the [[Warriors Three (Earth-616)|Warriors Three]], the [[Skurge (Earth-616)|Executioner]], and an army of Trolls. [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] banished the Hulk into the deep reaches of space{{r|Incredible Hulk #102}} where he clashed with the [[Randau (Earth-616)|Space Parasite]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #103}}

===Hunted by everyone===
The Hulk was captured by the US military, now fully backed by his longtime ally, Rick Jones. Banner was targeted by the newly restored [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]], who was seemingly killed in a fuel truck explosion.{{r|Incredible Hulk #104}} Briefly back in human form, Banner was shot by crooks, but he transformed back into the Hulk when being chased by police. The Hulk next battled the [[Lincoln Brickford (Earth-616)|Missing Link]], an irradiated prehistoric man sent to attack America by Chinese communists. The Link was seemingly destroyed in an explosion when it reached critical mass despite interference from Glenn Talbot, [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] and his Russian counterpart [[Yuri Brevlov (Earth-616)|Yuri Brevlov]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #105}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #106}} During this battle, Rick Jones was injured by the Hulk and then taken in by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] to become the new Bucky.{{r|Captain America #110}}

Attracting the attention of the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]], the Hulk was tested by the villain who hoped to work with him, but the Hulk rejected the offer,{{r|Incredible Hulk #107}} trashed the Mandarin's castle, and escaped.{{r|Incredible Hulk #108}} The Hulk accidentally freed the evil [[League of Evil Inhumans (Earth-616)|Inhumans]] led by [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]], who attempted to overthrow [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]]'s rule of [[Attilan]]. The Hulk wanted nothing to do with their rebellion and easily trounced them. Black Bolt offered the Hulk a place with the Inhumans, but after realizing that the other Inhumans feared him, the Hulk left the hidden land.{{r|Incredible Hulk Special #1}}

[[File:Hulk vs. Fin Fang Foom Vol 1 1.jpg|left|thumb]]
After a battle against [[Fin Fang Foom (Earth-616)|Fin Fang Foom]],{{r|Hulk vs. Fin Fang Foom #1}} the Hulk was dogged by the Chinese military. The Hulk hitched a ride on an experimental rocket which crashed in the Antarctic. Banner awoke in the [[Savage Land]] and got captured by the [[Swamp Men]] who attempted to sacrifice him until he was rescued by [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #109}} Hulk clashed with the alien robot [[Umbu (Earth-616)|Umbu the Unliving]] and destroyed it with Ka-Zar's help and saved the Earth. Banner suffered from exposure to Umbu's radiation.{{r|Incredible Hulk #110}} Having detected the destruction of Umbu, the [[Galaxy Master (Earth-616)|Galaxy Master]] captured the dying Banner and revived him. The Hulk battled the Sagittarians on a distant world{{r|Incredible Hulk #111}} and the seemingly destroyed the Galaxy Master, freeing its slaves.{{r|Incredible Hulk #113}}

The Mandarin sent the [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]] against the Hulk, resulting in the Sandman being fused into glass. The Hulk was once again captured by General Ross.{{r|Incredible Hulk #114}} With the Hulk in captivity, the Leader returned alive and well and offered his services to neutralize the threat of the Hulk once and for all. To this end he trapped the Hulk in a Plasticine prison.{{r|Incredible Hulk #115}} Betty freed the Hulk, but by then it was too late to stop the Leader from attempting to use the base's nuclear weapons to jump start World War III.{{r|Incredible Hulk #116}} Although Bruce Banner stopped most of the missiles, the Leader launched a second one, prompting Banner to become the Hulk again to stop it.{{r|Incredible Hulk #117}}

===No happiness for Bruce Banner===
[[File:Incredible Hulk Vol 1 123.jpg|left|thumb]]
[[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] of the Fantastic Four developed a cure for Banner's condition that worked to a degree. Banner gained the ability to transform into the Hulk at will while maintaining his intelligence. Vowing to never become the Hulk again, Banner proposed to Betty, who accepted.{{r|Incredible Hulk #123}} Sadly, the Leader recruited the Rhino and fired a gamma ray during Bruce and Betty's wedding, again causing Banner to turn into the Hulk. The Hulk clashed with the Rhino and the Leader, hospitalizing General Ross and destroying his home. The Hulk escaped, and Glenn Talbot vowed to Betty that he would destroy the Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk #124}}

Returning to the desert, the Hulk was sought out by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] who were seeking one of Banner's inventions that could heal their injured leader, [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]]. Although they briefly clashed, Banner returned long enough to give the X-Men what they needed to save their leader.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #66}}

Banner agreed to work with Glenn Talbot to try and stop a radioactive comet threatening Earth.

The Hulk once again became a pawn in the ongoing war between Tyrannus and the Mole Man. This time Tyrannus attempted to win the Hulk's cooperation by making him befriend his robot [[Mogol (Earth-616)|Mogol]]. When the Hulk learned that the creature was really a robot, he considered it a betrayal and destroyed him, and left Tyrannus' realm.{{r|Incredible Hulk #127}} Trying to get the surface, the Hulk nearly caused a massive earthquake by effecting fault lines on the west coast, leading to a clash with his old team, the Avengers.{{r|Incredible Hulk #128}} The Hulk was targeted by the Leader who revived the Glob and sent him after the Hulk in a plot that ultimately ended in failure.{{r|Incredible Hulk #129}}

Betty Ross suffered a nervous breakdown from the stress of dealing with Banner's double life as the Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk #132}}

===Have Hulk, will travel===
[[File:Incredible Hulk Vol 1 134.jpg|left|thumb]]
The Hulk ended up in the nation of [[Morvania]] and helped the resistance remove its dictator, [[VÃ¡clav Draxon (Earth-616)|VÃ¡clav Draxon]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #133|134}} Trapped in the future and seeking revenge against the Avengers, [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]] sent the Hulk back in time to [[World War I]] to kill the [[Karl Kaufman (Earth-616)|Phantom Eagle]].

Confused, the Hulk fled the scene.{{r|Sub-Mariner #25}}

The Leader sought to exert the Hulk to the point where the monster would die of a heart attack. He created psycho projections and led him towards the hospital where Betty Ross was, threatening to shatter Betty's fragile glass form. Thanks to interference from Jim Wilson, the Leader's plot was foiled.{{r|Incredible Hulk #139}}

The Hulk was captured by the military with aid from Mister Fantastic and Charles Xavier; however, he was teleported away by the insectoid [[Psyklop (Earth-616)|Psyklop]]. Psyklop sought to shrink the Hulk down in size and use him as a power source to bring his masters, the [[Dark Gods (Kai)|Dark Gods]], to Earth. The Avengers interrupted, causing the Hulk to shrink out of sight{{r|Avengers #88}} and get transported to the [[Microverse]] world of [[K'ai]]. On K'ai, the Banner persona was restored, and the Hulk joined a rebellion led by [[Jarella (Earth-616)|Jarella]] against the evil warlord [[Visis (Earth-616)|Visis]].

With vague memories of his adventure on K'ai, Banner was taken back to the military when psychiatrist [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Leonard Samson]] came up with a dual solution for curing Banner and restoring Betty to human form. Samson was successful in this; however, he used the siphoned gamma radiation to mutate himself into a gamma spawned Adonis. Samson romanced Betty Ross, making Banner so jealous that he purposely bombarded himself with gamma radiation and again became the Hulk to fight Doc Samson. When Betty vocalized concern for Samson over the Hulk, the Hulk fled the scene.{{r|Incredible Hulk #141}}

The plot ended in failure and Samantha reverted to normal.{{r|Incredible Hulk #142}} His next rampage through New York made Banner the subject of a military manhunt. He was rescued by Doctor Doom,{{r|Incredible Hulk #143}} who smuggled Banner into Latveria in order to exploit his brilliant mind and then sent the Hulk out with a bomb in order to annex neighboring countries into Latveria. This was opposed by Doom's childhood love [[Valeria (Latverian) (Earth-616)|Valeria]], and led to a battle between Doom and the Hulk. The Hulk fled when he realized Valeria could have been harmed if the fight continued.{{r|Incredible Hulk #144}}

Doctor Strange recruited the Hulk, the Sub-Mariner, and the Silver Surfer to stop [[Yandroth (Earth-616)|Yandroth]] from setting his Omegatron to destroy Earth. They formed a loose knit team of heroes known as the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]]. The Hulk answered a call from the Avengers to help to stop [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]] and the Enchantress from fulfilling a prophecy that would have given him mastery over the entire world.{{r|Avengers #100}} The Hulk later ended up in [[Egypt]], where he was talked into taking a part in a movie being filmed there. Banner was fired from the movie set and was caught in the middle of the [[Horusians]] God-Spawn battle, destroying their champion, the Colossus.{{r|Incredible Hulk #145}}

===Project: Greenskin===
The US military built Project: Greenskin, aka [[Gamma Base|Hulkbuster Base]], as a specialized facility to capture the Hulk. Upon its construction, General Ross was replaced with a robot by the Leader. The Leader was disguised as Glenn Talbot in the hopes of not only destroying the Hulk, but replacing the President and Vice President with robot duplicates.{{r|Incredible Hulk #146}} The Hulk foiled the Leader's plot, and in the aftermath of the battle, Doc Samson lost his powers. The Hulk fled into the desert, briefly encountering a mirage city that would vanish as quickly as it appeared.{{r|Incredible Hulk #147}}

The Hulk was again captured by the military and cured by [[Peter Corbeau (Earth-616)|Peter Corbeau]]. Jarella transported herself to Earth to seek the Hulk.

When it was determined that Jarella's presence on Earth risked the planet's destruction, Jarella willingly returned to K'ai.{{r|Incredible Hulk #148}} Sedated at Project: Greenskin, the Hulk battled the High Evolutionary's exiled New Man, the [[Inheritor (Earth-616)|Inheritor]], when the creature came seeking radiation to prolong its evolved state.{{r|Incredible Hulk #149}} When the Hulk came across [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Lorna Dane]], he confused her for Jarella and captured her. Lorna was saved by her fellow X-Man, [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]]. Betty heard Bruce calling out for Jarella, prompting her to begin a romance with Glenn Talbot.{{r|Incredible Hulk #150}}

Banner sought out Henry Pym in Washington D.C. to find a means to shrink small enough to return to Jarella's world. There, Banner learned Pym's talk had been canceled; this enraged him so much that he transformed into the Hulk, who went on a rampage. The Hulk ultimately saved Washington from [[Morton Clegstead (Earth-616)|Senator Morton Clegstead]] who, while trying to find a cure for cancer via gamma radiation, had mutated into a massive pile of ooze.{{r|Incredible Hulk #151}} Returning to the Nevada desert, the Hulk was captured by Project: Greenskin and [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Banner was put on trial for the Hulk's rampage in Washington, D.C. Lawyer [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]] (secretly Daredevil) represented Banner.{{r|Incredible Hulk #152}} It seemed likely that the Hulk would be sentenced to death until Reed Richards offered to try and cure Banner with his Nega-Gamma Gun; however, this only strengthened the Hulk further, allowing him to escape.{{r|Incredible Hulk #153}}

The Hulk broke into Pym's lab and consumed one of his shrinking formulas. This caused him to shrink to miniature size, and he was captured by the Chameleon, who was then working for Hydra. The Hulk attempted to escape Hydra's clutches with the help of Ant-Man; however. the unstable formula shrank him down to the Microverse.{{r|Incredible Hulk #154}} As he shrank down to size, he ruined the fantasy world created by the [[Shaper of Worlds (Earth-616)|Shaper of Worlds]] for the former Nazi [[Otto Kronsteig (Earth-616)|Kronsteig]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #155}} Finally reaching Jarella's world, the Hulk, with Banner's intellect restored, again helped Jarella overthrow Visis.

The Abomination lost the fight, but he succeeded in his task. Learning that Betty was heading to [[Niagara Falls]], he pursued her.{{r|Incredible Hulk #159}}

[[File:Defenders Vol 1 10.jpg|right|thumb]]
The Hulk got sidetracked when he was recruited by Doctor Strange to rejoin the Defenders in searching for the Silver Surfer, clashing with [[Calizuma (Earth-616)|Calizuma]].{{r|Defenders #2}} The group ended up in the realm of the Undying One, battling their leader the [[Nameless One (Undying Ones Leader) (Earth-616)|Nameless One]] and rescuing Barbara Norris.{{r|Defenders #3}} They next clashed with the Enchantress and Executioner, ending with Barbara being revived as the Valkyrie.{{r|Defenders #4}} The Defenders were then called to clash with the Omegatron, which, with the Valkyrie's aid, they destroyed.{{r|Defenders #5}}

===Separated From the Hulk===
Leonard Samson captured the Hulk{{r|Incredible Hulk #314}} and succeeded in separating Banner's psyche and atomic structure from the larger atomic structure of the Hulk. The Hulk's body, with all personality and memory removed, was inert until Samson stimulated the brain within the body. This new incarnation of the Hulk escaped and became a greater menace than ever before.{{r|Incredible Hulk #315}}

Banner became leader of a new [[Hulkbusters (Banner) (Earth-616)|Hulkbusters]] task force which he headed from Gamma Base.{{r|Incredible Hulk #317}} Banner finally married Betty Ross, believing himself free of the curse of the Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk #319}} During the honeymoon, Bruce became gravely ill and was hospitalized.{{r|Incredible Hulk #320}} Due to his separation from the Hulk, Bruce's body began to lose molecular cohesion. The Hulk's body soon followed suit and he was defeated by the Avengers.{{r|Incredible Hulk #322}} With the aid of the synthezoid known as the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], Bruce was re-merged with the Hulk. The original Hulk persona assumed control of the body;{{r|Incredible Hulk #323}} however, the reintegration was unstable, and an attempt to stabilize, and possibly cure, Bruce in a nutrient tank resulted in the Hulk returning to his original gray incarnation who only manifested at night.

Rick Jones absorbed the excess gamma radiation and became a light green Hulk-like creature when he was pushed into the nutrient bath by General Ross, who was attempting to sabotage the experiment and kill the Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk #324}} Bruce reasoned the best way to cure Rick was to use the machine from the [[Hulk's Cave]] to change himself into the Hulk. Little did he know that this was a subliminal suggestion placed by the Hulk himself, who, once free, smashed the machine to avoid turning back into Banner. Complicating matters, the Leader arrived, having followed the Hulk in hopes of regaining his faded intellect. When he found the machine destroyed, the Leader made a deal with the now-smarter Hulk to transfer Rick Jones' gamma radiation into himself. Shortly after, a dishonored Thaddeus Ross managed to take control of the energy creature [[Zzzax (Earth-616)|Zzzax]]. Ross and Jones were defeated and the radiation energy was transferred from Jones to Sterns which caused an explosion in the lab leading to the Leader's supposed death.{{r|Incredible Hulk #332}}

===Ground Zero===
Little did either the Hulk nor Banner know that the Leader had survived, and sent the vampiric [[Tony Masterson (Earth-616)|Half-Life]] after him. The Hulk tore off Half-Life's limbs close to daybreak before the villain could pull himself together.{{r|Incredible Hulk #334}}

The [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Council decided they had enough Gamma bombs so that Banner was no longer required and ordered [[Clay Quartermain (Earth-616)|Agent Quartermain]] to murder him. The mutant bounty hunters [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] managed to locate the Hulk and freeze him in place before placing a call to S.H.I.E.L.D. After transporting the Hulk back to [[Gamma Base]], Quartermain went against the orders of the Council before blowing up several large explosive charges that wiped out Gamma Base. Quartermain took Banner and Rick Jones away from S.H.I.E.L.D. While on the way to the government stash of gamma bombs, Betty Banner was released from the Leader's captivity to help stall them. She revealed that she was pregnant with Banner's child. The Hulk decided to keep Betty safe, despite her being Bruce Banner's wife, not his. The quartet made their way to the government facility, but they found out -- too late -- that the Leader's henchmen [[Samuel John LaRoquette (Earth-616)|Rock]] and [[Craig Saunders Jr. (Earth-616)|Redeemer]] had already taken a gamma bomb. When the Leader detonated the gamma bomb in [[Middletown (Arizona)|Middletown]] with the Hulk at ground zero, the Hulk was assumed to be dead.{{r|Incredible Hulk #344|345}}

In reality, the Hulk had been transported to [[Jarella (Earth-616)|Jarella]]'s world moments before the detonation. There, the Hulk helped a group of minor wizards to overthrow the "Grand Inquisitor" in return for a spell which was promised to rid him of Bruce Banner for good.{{r|Incredible Hulk #351|352}}

===Joe Fixit===
[[File:Hulk Smash Avengers Vol 1 4 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Joe Fixit]]
When the Hulk returned to Earth, he took a job as an enforcer at a casino. Calling himself Mr. Fixit, the Hulk spent several months without reverting to human form. It was during this time that he met and dated [[Marlo Chandler (Earth-616)|Marlo Chandler]], who would one day marry Rick Jones. Banner eventually returned and the Hulk's life as Mr. Fixit soon came to an end through the machinations of the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #347|348}}

===Multiple Personas===
Banner found Betty working in a convent when he was attacked by [[Prometheus (Pantheon) (Earth-616)|Prometheus]], an agent of a team called the [[Pantheon (Earth-616)|Pantheon]]. The stress and anger of being unable to get to Betty caused the Savage Hulk persona to resurface and sent Bruce's psyche into turmoil. The Grey Hulk managed to keep the Green behind a mental door, but knew that since he had been unleashed once, it was only a matter of time before the Savage Hulk would take over.{{r|Incredible Hulk #372}}

When the Hulk was needed to fight the [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super Skrull]], the Grey Hulk convinced Banner to bring him out instead of the Savage Hulk. The Gray Hulk managed to outsmart the Super Skrull and managed to save Betty. Inside Banner's mind, the Gray Hulk and the Green Hulk were fighting for dominance. Through hypnosis, Samson created the green intelligent "Merged" Hulk - an integration of Banner's separate personalities.{{r|Incredible Hulk #377}}

===The Pantheon===
This incarnation of the Hulk joined the [[Pantheon (Earth-616)|Pantheon]]. The Pantheon were led by [[Vali Halfling (Earth-616)|Agamemnon]], an immortal offspring of an Asgardian and a human. Unknown at the time was that centuries earlier, Agamemnon had offered any of his offspring to the alien [[Troyjans]] in exchange for the ability to pass his godhood down to his descendants.{{r|Incredible Hulk #421}}

As a favor to their friend Jim Wilson, the Hulk and Rick agreed to help out at an AIDS benefit concert with Rick headlining and Hulk providing security. The concert was disrupted by the drug-addicted assassin [[Joss Shappe (Earth-616)|Speedfreek]], who was sent to kill one of the concert attendees. Jim was stabbed defending the man, and the Hulk got rid of Speedfreek before he could kill anybody.{{r|Incredible Hulk #388}}

During one of his missions with the Pantheon, the Hulk fought alongside a rebel force in [[Trans-Sabal]] against both S.H.I.E.L.D. issue [[Mandroids]] and the government mutant team [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]. Tran-Sabal's dictator, [[Farnoq Dahn (Earth-616)|Farnoq Dahn]], had promised the US government energy assistance if they helped him keep his place as unchallenged ruler. He was exposed as a psycho when he tried to win the war by tying a mother and child to two separate missiles and threatened to launch them if the Pantheon did not withdraw. The Hulk and X-Factor, working together, stopped him. The tyrant was forced to face his people for the crimes he had committed, but most of them still saw him as a god and bowed at his feet. He was then shot and killed by a traumatized Rick Jones.{{r|Incredible Hulk #390|392}}

Pantheon member [[Atalanta (Pantheon) (Earth-616)|Atalanta]] was shot down in the [[Himalayas]] by the Troyjan warrior [[Trow-Mah (Earth-616)|Trauma]], so the Hulk, [[Walter Charles (Earth-616)|Ulysses]], and [[Hector (Pantheon) (Earth-616)|Hector]] were sent to find her. Trauma found Atalanta and confessed his love to her before the Hulk showed up and brought down an avalanche on top of him.{{r|Incredible Hulk #394}}

During this time Marlo was killed by a woman posing as Rick's mother. Because the Leader shared a mental bond with Rick, he offered to bring her back to life. The Leader attacked the Pantheon's headquarters, [[Mount|The Mount]], using both his gamma soldiers and the [[U-Foes (Earth-616)|U-Foes]] to distract the Hulk so that he could ask Agamemnon for help against [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]. Agamemnon agreed to help and the Hulk left in anger. Agamemnon betrayed the Leader by sending the Hulk to Freehold in order to kill him. The Hulk crashed into Freehold during the middle of the Hydra invasion and when the Leader was trying to resurrect Marlo. Overcome with anger, the Hulk ignored Rick's pleas to stop and destroyed the machine because he thought that the Leader was lying and taking advantage of his grieving friend. The Leader was seemingly killed in the battle. The Hulk knocked the helmet off of Redeemer, saw the resurrected General Ross, and realized his mistake.{{r|Incredible Hulk #400}}

When Agamemnon felt it was time to venture out into the world to reconnect with the common people, he appointed the Hulk as his replacement. On his first mission as leader he traveled to the [[Amazon Jungle|Amazon]] to investigate a new company that was cutting down the rain forest. There, he was jumped by the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] who was working as an enforcer for the [[New World Order (Earth-616)|New World Order (NWO)]] and their leader, the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]]. The Hulk was captured and brainwashed into fighting the Avengers, believing that the Juggernaut was Banner's own abusive father. The Hulk was able to shake off the mind control when the Juggernaut praised him and he realized that Banner's real father would never have shown such kindness. The psychic backlash released the creature [[Gilbert Benson (Earth-616)|Piecemeal]] from his holding container.{{r|Incredible Hulk #404}}

The Hulk began showing signs of instability when he began referring to himself as "Hulk" or "the Hulk" instead of "Bruce." As a favor to a former Pantheon member [[Scott Shannon (Earth-616)|Perseus]], the Hulk traveled to [[Loch Ness]] to investigate reports of a monster in the lake, which turned out to be [[Piecemeal (NWO) (Earth-616)|Piecemeal]]. The Hulk was about to defeat him when the [[Philip Sterns (Earth-616)|Madman]] interfered. After Perseus was killed, the Hulk killed Piecemeal and appeared to kill the Madman, but no body was found. Using his new power as leader of the Pantheon, the Hulk led a strike against a maximum security prison to free an ex-girlfriend who had been falsely imprisoned.{{r|Incredible Hulk #407|411}}

Trauma returned and kidnapped Atalanta to make her his bride. With the help of the Silver Surfer and the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]], the Hulk and the Pantheon attacked the Troyjan home world. Upon arriving they were all shocked when Trauma's father, the Troyjan leader, Lord Armageddon, told them the truth about Agamemnon. If they tried to take Atalanta back, then the Troyjans would take back the extended lives of the entire Pantheon. The Hulk, not caring about the deal, attacked Trauma, accidentally impaling Trauma on his own shoulder spike. With his last words, Trauma pardoned the Pantheon and asked his father to let them all leave in peace.{{r|Incredible Hulk #413|416}}

===Maestro===
{{Quote|You don't know what lies ahead for you. I do. Listen to me, Bruce... they're going to take it all away. You're going to end up with nothing and no one. Why go back to that... when you can stay here and have everything|[[Bruce Banner (Earth-9200)|Maestro]]}}

The Hulk was taken into the future by Rick Jones' granddaughter [[Janis Jones (Earth-9200)|Janis]] to fight his future self, [[Bruce Banner (Earth-9200)|Maestro]]. Maestro was a tyrant who had killed all the heroes and villains on earth and named himself emperor of the post-apocalyptic world. He had the intelligence of Banner and was twice as strong as the Hulk, their first fight ending with the Maestro breaking the Hulk's neck and keeping him prisoner for the next few days as his wound healed. After the Hulk confirmed that he couldn't defeat his future self in a straight fight, Maestro was killed when the Hulk sent him back in time to ground zero at the moment the gamma bomb that created him had gone off, having determined that only a ground-zero nuclear blast would be enough to kill him. After killing Maestro the Hulk was sent back to the present, haunted by the thought of losing control and becoming Maestro.{{r|{{cl|Hulk: Future Imperfect Vol 1 1}}-[[Hulk: Future Imperfect Vol 1 2|2]]}}

===Betty moves in===
Soon after this, Rick and Marlo were married. At the wedding Betty told the Hulk that she wanted to move into the Mount to be with him. After the wedding, the Hulk was attacked by the disgraced Skrull warrior [[Talos (Earth-616)|Talos the Tamed]]. In an effort to gain back some honor, Talos wanted to be killed by Earth's strongest warrior. The Hulk refused to fight because of how well his relationship with Betty was going and he did not want to risk losing his temper again. Later, the Hulk received news that his old partner Jim Wilson was at an AIDS protest that was getting out of control. He took him back to the Mount to give him treatment, but despite the advanced technology, Jim still died.{{r|Incredible Hulk #418|420}}

===Trial of Agamemnon===
Having discovered the truth about Agamemnon, the Hulk and the rest of the Pantheon made him stand trial. Agamemnon resurrected all of the dead Pantheon warriors to kill everyone in the Mount. Agamemnon tried to escape, but he was instead killed by Atalanta, which brought an end to the undead warriors. [[Helmut Halfling (Earth-616)|Achilles]], still loyal to Agamemnon, tried killing teammate Ulysses, but the bullet ricocheted and hit Betty. The Hulk became so angry that he reverted to Bruce Banner's body with the Hulk's brain, apparently the result of a psychic failsafe he had created during the initial merging of his personas to prevent the return of the Savage Hulk. Even in his human form he gave off enough gamma radiation to make Achilles vulnerable, and Ulysses killed him.{{r|Incredible Hulk #421|425}}

===Betty's death and resurrection===
The Pantheon fled their former base, and the still mindless Bruce was taken into custody and temporarily placed in the care of Doc Samson while Betty was treated for the bullet wound. [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] took Banner into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody because he was a fugitive. During Bruce's transport, Betty died and her soul was given the chance to go to heaven. First she wanted to visit Bruce to see if he still loved her. He calmed down when he saw her and was able to transform and escape. After seeing how important she was to him Betty decided to live and returned to her body. The Hulk visited the destroyed Mount and saw a hologram set up by Paris, telling him that he was now the leader of the Pantheon and that the Hulk had been fired from it.{{r|Incredible Hulk #426}}

===Living in Florida===
Living under the last name Danner, the Hulk and Betty moved to a small town in Florida. To hide his green skin, the Hulk wore bandages all over his body and claimed to be a burn victim. Soon after their move a child was killed by a gigantic shadowy figure, and the Hulk was suspected of the crime because of his size. Upon investigation, the Hulk found out that the true killer was a deranged old man living in the everglades with the [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]], and rescued a child. A few days later the Hulk and Betty offered their help to a young pregnant homeless girl. While at the clinic protesters attacked, and the girl was shot and killed. The Hulk offered the girl's father his help in bringing her killer to justice. They learned the killer was just a kid who had accidentally shot her when someone pushed him. The father revealed himself to be Speedfreek and tried to kill the kid. The Hulk hurled a car battery at Speedfreek, which covered him in battery acid, burning most of the skin off his face and causing him to flee.{{r|Incredible Hulk #427|430}}

The Hulk learned that the [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Abomination]] was fighting cops in the sewers of New York and decided that it was his problem. The homeless were being cleared out because the police commissioner was working for a drug lord who needed the sewers for new drug routes. While the Hulk confronted the Abomination, the cops used the opportunity to clear out the homeless by killing almost all of them. The Abomination snapped and started killing all the cops, then took his battle with the Hulk to the surface. They crashed through the [[Daily Bugle Building|''Daily Bugle'']] before the Abomination jumped onto a news copter and crashed it. He used the opportunity to escape while the Hulk was distracted.{{r|Incredible Hulk #431|432}}

===Ghosts of the future===
An army squad led by [[William Matthew Talbot (Earth-616)|Matt Talbot]] captured Betty. After the Hulk saw Matt shoot Betty in both legs, he went so far over the edge that he reverted to his Banner form, and Banner was taken into custody. During a jailbreak Bruce, still with the mind of the Hulk, ran towards a grenade and nearly died when it went off. He was able to transform into the Hulk before he could be killed, but a shrapnel fragment was left in his brain, extremely hindering his intelligence.{{r|Incredible Hulk #436|437}}

Seeking a device to remove the shrapnel, the Hulk traveled to the Leader's Freehold. With the Leader dead, the hidden arctic sanctuary Freehold had been placed in the care of [[Burt Horowitz (Earth-616)|Omnibus]]. Omnibus believed that there would eventually be a nuclear war that would kill everyone on Earth so he decided to speed it up by ordering terrorist attacks across the world to cause strain on global relations. He had also mentally controlled many high ranking government officials including Talbot which explained his insane behavior. [[Jess Harrison (Earth-616)|Jailbait]] overheard Omnibus' plan and exposed him to the people of Freehold and he was sentenced to death. The Hulk decided that the best way to save the world would be to pose as Maestro and claim to be the man behind the terrorist attacks. A psychotic [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] was sent to defeat him. It was a close battle until an atom bomb was dropped on top of them. The Hulk was believed dead by most of the world, but he had actually used a hidden Pantheon base to survive.{{r|Incredible Hulk #438|440}}

===[[Onslaught (Event)|Onslaught]]/[[Heroes Reborn (1996 Event)|Heroes Reborn]]===
Traveling through Alaska, the Hulk ran into Janis and took her to an unused Pantheon, He was then mentally ordered by [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]] to find and kill [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]]. Cable and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] were able to free the Hulk from Onslaught's control, and they joined the rest of the heroes in New York for the battle against Onslaught. The Hulk and Banner were separated after he destroyed Onslaught's body. Banner was among the heroes who sacrificed themselves to destroy Onslaught,{{r|Onslaught Marvel Universe #1}} and the Savage Hulk was again unleashed on the world. Banner was seemingly killed when Onslaught was destroyed, but like all the other heroes who had seemingly sacrificed their lives, Banner had actually been transported to the [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Counter-Earth]] [[Dimension F|pocket dimension]] created by [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #443|445}}{{r|Onslaught Marvel Universe Vol 1}}

In this new pocket-universe, Banner and the new heroes were reborn. He lived a new life where he had gone to State University with Reed Richards, Victor von Doom, Tony Stark, and Henry Pym. Along with Tony's friend [[Conner O'Reilly (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Conner "Rebel" O'Reilly]] they formed the Atomic Knights of the Round Table. Banner worked with them on an exosuit project; however, none of them could decide how to use it. Banner shifted his focus to gamma radiation research instead. After university, he began working for [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 2 5}}

Stark Industries became a target of the terrorist organization, [[Hydra (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Hydra]], secretly funded by Victor von Doom. At the time Banner was creating a gamma bomb for the military which Hydra set off with Banner inside. The resulting explosion mutated Banner into a new incarnation of the Hulk. He clashed with Stark in his new persona as Iron Man.{{r|Iron Man Vol 2 #1|2}} The Hulk escaped and was later manipulated by [[Loki Laufeyson (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Loki]] to attack the newly formed [[Avengers (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Avengers]] at their [[Hydrobase|Avengers Island]] headquarters. The battle injured many of their members, decimated their base, and caused a breach in its power supply, the powerful gamma core.{{r|{{cl|Avengers Vol 2 4}}-[[Avengers Vol 2 5|5]]}} The Hulk aided the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], Iron Man, and the Avengers in containing the breach and saving the eastern United States from destruction.{{r|Avengers Vol 2 6}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 2 6}}

The Hulk and his cousin, [[Jennifer Walters (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Jennifer Walters]], sought the aid of [[Leonard Samson (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Leonard Samson]] to find a means to stabilize the Hulk's mutation. Samson, also mutated by gamma rays, received a blood transfusion to stabilize his mutation, and Jennifer impulsively took a transfusion as well mutating herself into the She-Hulk. They joined together as the [[Hulkbusters (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Hulkbusters]] and offered their services to Tony Stark.{{r|Iron Man Vol 2 #9|11}}

The Hulk aided the world's heroes in stopping [[Galactus (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Galactus]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 2 12}}{{r|Avengers Vol 2 12}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 2 12}}{{r|Captain America Vol 2 12}} The Hulk also aided the world's heroes when the Counter-Earth dimension was briefly merged with a universe from a distant cosmos (designated [[dcdp:Earth-50|Earth-50]]) to create [[Earth-13]] and prevented an invasion from the Skrulls and the Negative Zone before the proper status quo was restored.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 2 13}}{{r|Avengers Vol 2 13}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 2 13}}{{r|Captain America Vol 2 13}}

===Back on Earth===
[[File:Incredible Hulk Vol 1 453.jpg|right|thumb]]
While Bruce Banner was reborn into a new life on Counter-Earth, the Savage Hulk, again freed from Banner, still existed independently on Earth. The Hulk's body began giving off radiation equivalent to a nuclear bomb. The army found that anything that came within five feet of him would be melted by radiation. Betty showed up and the Hulk broke free. Moments later [[Jason (Pantheon) (Earth-616)|Jason the Renegade]] stepped from the shadows and shot the Hulk with a Pantheon gun which caused the soldiers to panic and begin shooting. The Hulk laughed off the bullets and escaped with Janis, leaving Betty in tears.{{r|Incredible Hulk #446|447}}

The Pantheon had become a democracy and had outvoted Paris to bring the Hulk back into the group. Paris approached [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Gyrich]] with a proposition to take down the Hulk for good. The Pantheon attacked Janis and appeared to kill the Hulk, but what he really destroyed was actually nothing more than a mindless cloned body the Pantheon had created. The Hulk destroyed their ship and headed towards Washington, D.C., with Janis, where she told the military that the Hulk would not run any longer. If they attacked him, then he would attack a major city in retaliation.{{r|Incredible Hulk #448}}

While he was traveling through the Midwest, the Hulk and Janis were attacked by the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], whom he easily defeated. He then destroyed a dam to fulfill his promise of retaliation. The Hulk began having chest pains that would force him to keel over in pain, although at the same time he was physically becoming more powerful. [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] found that because of his split from Banner, excess energy from an alternate universe was channeling through him that could destroy the universe.{{r|Incredible Hulk #449|450}}

Under extreme emotional stress, the Hulk returned to the Gamma Base where he had been created. He was ambushed by the newest person placed in charge of capturing the Hulk, Colonel Cary St. Lawrence. The Hulk considered this the ultimate invasion of privacy because he considered the Gamma Base "his place." He was about to kill her when he had the idea to take over an island in the [[Florida Keys]] which he renamed Hulk Island. He saved the inhabitants from a hurricane, and they grew to respect him.{{r|Incredible Hulk #451}}

A few days after the hurricane, Janis showed up with an alternate incarnation of the Hulk who had come to Earth when the Hulk was teleported away by Doctor Strange. He offered his help to the Hulk, but the shrapnel in his brain was making him angry at everything; thus, he fought him until he was taken back to his own time.{{r|Incredible Hulk #452|453}}

===Horseman of Apocalypse===
[[File:Incredible Hulk Vol 1 457.jpg|right|thumb]]
The Hulk was manipulated by [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] into becoming one of his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horsemen]]. The Hulk agreed to serve Apocalypse if he would remove the shrapnel from the Hulk's brain. As War, he battled the [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]] and the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]], but they had been sent by the NWO with Rick and Janis Jones to stop this new incarnation of the Hulk, who was using the power of the [[Celestials (Race)|Celestials]]. He nearly killed the Absorbing Man and the Juggernaut, but Rick jumped in and the Hulk swung at him. Seeing the crippled body of his best friend caused the Hulk to break free of the mind control and flee in shame.{{r|Incredible Hulk #456|457}}

The alien [[Abigail Wright (Earth-616)|Mercy]] sensed the Hulk's desire for death and sent him on a path to fight [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mr. Hyde]], but the Hulk wanted a good death and refused to be killed by what he considered an unworthy foe. Wanting to help put the Hulk out of his misery, Mercy sent him to one of his deadliest enemies, the Abomination. Sulking through New York, the Hulk found the Abomination, but because of all the damage done to his own brain, he hallucinated that he was in the Abomination's place and began letting out all his built-up rage from the last few months on him.{{r|Incredible Hulk #458|459}}

===Heroes return===
By this point, the Celestials had come to judge which universe would live and which one would die: Universe-616 or Franklin Richards' Counter-Earth pocket dimension. They sent their agent [[Ashema (Earth-616)|Ashema]] to Earth to show Franklin Richards his handiwork and force him to choose between one world and another.{{r|Heroes Reborn: The Return #1}}

At this point, the Hulk on Earth-616 was on a rampage through New York City, bringing Doc Samson, Hercules, Spider-Man, and the Thunderbolts together to try and stop him. Meanwhile on Counter-Earth, the Banner-Hulk was on rampage through New York City as well clashing with the Thing and Thor. Doctor Strange found a link between the trans-dimensional energies coming from the Hulk's body and from Franklin Richards' mysterious blue ball. Bringing the ball into close proximity to the Hulk caused both him and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] to be transported to Counter-Earth; there, the two Hulks clashed, attracting the attention of the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and Doctor Doom. It was decided that to save both realities from destruction, all the Earth-616 heroes would have to return to their native world. Both the Hulk and Banner were brought back with them. When they breached the gulf between both worlds, the Hulk and Banner were merged back together again.{{r|{{cl|Heroes Reborn: The Return Vol 1 1}}-[[Heroes Reborn: The Return Vol 1 4|4]]}}

===Self-destruction===
After finally being reunited with Banner, the Hulk was transported to the site of his birth, the gamma bomb test site. The strain on his body was slowly killing him, and he was giving off massive amounts of radiation that were sufficient enough for the Maestro to absorb and return to life. Maestro was taken by trolls to be the newest mind to inhabit the [[Destroyer (Enchanted Armor)|Destroyer]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #460|461}}

Bruce and General Ross were attacked by the Destroyer and his troll minions. During the battle the Destroyer stepped in a pool of the Hulk's blood. It recognized that the Hulk and Maestro were the same being and drew the Hulk's mind inside of it. The Hulk was able to outsmart Maestro and crush him under a rock slide. Bruce was brought back to Gamma Base, where he established some kind of control over the Hulk, started rebuilding his life with Betty, and made peace with her father, General Ross.{{r|Incredible Hulk #461|462}}

Later, the Troyjans attacked and Bruce and agreed to meet with their leader, Lord Armageddon. After seeing Bruce leave with the aliens, the press believed that he had heroically sacrificed himself to save the president's daughter. Armageddon wanted the Hulk's help in resurrecting his son Trauma with the device the Leader had previously used to bring Marlo back to life. The device needed a very large gamma power source in order to work and he planned on sacrificing the Hulk to do it. Bruce refused, but the Hulk agreed and stepped into the machine. During the process, however, the Hulk gave off too much radiation and incinerated Trauma's body. Armageddon agreed to live in peace out of fear of punishment from the Silver Surfer, but after the Hulk left, he leveled Freehold and killed everyone living there, including the gamma beings Jailbait and [[Louis Lembert (Earth-616)|Hotshot]]. Bruce was given a secret pardon for his crimes as the Hulk for saving the president's daughter.{{r|Incredible Hulk #463|464}}

===Death of Betty Banner===
Just when everything started going right with the Hulk, Betty nearly died due to gamma radiation poisoning that resulted from her time with the Hulk. Bruce was able to find a cure using his blood in a transfusion. But then she was pushed over the edge by the transfusion when the Abomination secretly switched it with his blood instead as revenge. Bruce went insane and tried to kill himself seconds after Betty was pronounced dead. Doc Samson stopped Banner, but he later transformed into the Hulk and escaped from Gamma Base. Banner began coming up with elaborate scenarios to kill himself, but he would always transform into the Hulk seconds before death.{{r|Incredible Hulk #465|467}}

With Betty dead and Bruce believed to have killed her, General Ross again started to hunt the Hulk. Bruce figured out the truth behind Betty's death when he went to the homeworld of the [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Watcher]] and was given infinite knowledge. He returned to Earth to get revenge on the Abomination, but he let him go. Confronting General Ross, Banner told him that they were both to blame for Betty's death.{{r|Incredible Hulk #468|474}}

===Mental cure===
[[File:Incredible Hulk Vol 2 77 Textless.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Incredible Hulk]]
Due to the deteriorating effects of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the chaos ravaging his mindscape,{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 12}} Banner struck a deal with the Hulk's three dominant personalities--the Green Hulk, the Gray "Joe Fixit" Hulk and the "Professor" Hulk--essentially to time-share their existence in return for stabilizing his fractured psyche and providing him with release from his disease.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 13}} Despite the intervention of General [[John Ryker (Earth-616)|John Ryker]],{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 20}} Bruce was able to retain control until the Leader provided the means to cure Bruce,{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 31}} using genetic samples taken from the corpse of [[Brian Banner (Earth-616)|Brian Banner]] and added to the Hulk's DNA by [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]]. The transformation back into Bruce Banner triggered a catalytic reaction that repaired the damage to Bruce's cellular structure and cured the disease.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 32}}

===Order===
The original [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]], including the Hulk, re-formed when [[Yandroth (Earth-616)|Yandroth]] surfaced again to menace the world. Though the heroes defeated his plan, Yandroth used his sorcery to levy a deathbed curse upon their heads, binding them to come together in times of crisis.{{r|Defenders Vol 2 1}} The curse magnified the egos of the cursed quartet until they became mentally unstable. They became the Order, seeking to end all threats to the Earth by taking control of it. Other heroes fought them, and the energies unleashed by the battle were harnessed to resurrect and further empower Yandroth. Coming to their senses, the Defenders stopped fighting and Yandroth was reduced back to his human form, defeated, and imprisoned.{{r|{{cl|The Order Vol 1 1}}-[[The Order Vol 1 6|6]]}}

===Planet Hulk===
{{Main|Planet Hulk}}
[[File:Incredible Hulk Vol 2 92 Textless.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Planet Hulk]]
Banner sought refuge and peace in [[Alaska (State)|Alaska]], where he lived as a hermit loosely connected to the town community. He was eventually tracked down by Nick Fury of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who required his help in defeating the Hydra space weapon called the [[Godseye (Earth-616)|Godseye]], which could detonate all the nuclear bombs in the world. Sent up as the Hulk, he discovered that the Godseye was actually a rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. weapon that could match the strength of any enemy. In the ensuing battle, the Godseye found that though it could try, it could not match the increasing power of the Hulk, since it was unable to duplicate Banner's unique ability to '''''channel''''' gamma energy even if it could '''''duplicate''''' the energy itself, and it exploded.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 89|91}}

A S.H.I.E.L.D.-commissioned space shuttle was sent to retrieve the Hulk, or so he believed. Seizing the opportunity to be rid of the Hulk, a group of superheroes known as the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] decided to jettison the shuttle into space to a planet with no intelligent lifeforms. Unfortunately, there was a navigation error, and the Hulk landed on the planet [[Sakaar]], a world filled with barbarian tribes, gladiator battles and ruled by a corrupt empire. The planet was situated near a portal, which gave it access to several different cultures and technologies. The Hulk was captured and became a gladiator. The Hulk subsequently ushered an uprising, overthrowing the current regime.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 92|102}}

Installing himself as king, the Hulk met and fell in love with a queen named [[Caiera the Oldstrong (Earth-616)|Caiera Oldstrong]]. Together, they ushered in a new age of peace and prosperity for Sakaar. Caiera became pregnant with the Hulk's child, but died when the shuttle that brought the Hulk to Sakaar suddenly exploded, killing millions of people.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 103|105}} Driven to new heights of rage and fury, the Hulk swore revenge against the Illuminati, whom he held responsible for the death of Caiera Oldstrong. With his allies, the [[Warbound (Earth-616)|Warbound]], the Hulk rode atop the prow of an alien warship as it set course for Earth.{{r|World War Hulk Prologue: World Breaker #1}}

===World War Hulk===
{{Main|World War Hulk}}
Reaching the moon, the Hulk defeated the Illuminati member [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] -- who was actually a [[Blackagar Boltagon (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Skrull impersonating Black Bolt]] -- not the real one. The Hulk then proceeded to New York City, where he demanded that the city be evacuated and the presence of the Illuminati. As the time limit for the evacuation of New York had passed, the Hulk defeated Iron Man, and [[Stark Tower (Columbus Circle, Original)|Avengers Tower]] was destroyed in the process.{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1}}

The heroes engaged the Hulk and his Warbound, but were defeated. After the Hulk became allied with [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], [[Aquaria Neptuna (Earth-616)|Namora]], and the [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]], General "Thunderbolt" Ross called in the U.S. Army to dispatch the Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 107}} Despite the army's best efforts, including the use of adamantium bullets, the Hulk instead defeated them. Alongside his Warbound, he transformed an area near [[Madison Square Garden]] into a gladiatorial arena.{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 3}}

Doctor Strange, mystically invoking a powerful old enemy, [[Zom (Earth-616)|Zom]], battled the Hulk. Barely holding back the demon Zom, Doctor Strange began to exhibit some of the demon's own traits. Strange sent the Hulk crashing into a building that crumbled upon him and the innocent bystanders who had gathered to watch the fight. The Hulk had protected the innocent bystanders. Distraught by his actions almost killing innocents, Doctor Strange stopped fighting, and, uncaring, the Hulk gave Strange a lesson on control and pummeled him into the ground.{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 3|4}}

After implanting "obedience disks" in all of the captured heroes, the Hulk set Black Bolt, Mister Fantastic, Doctor Strange, and Iron Man into the arena. The Hulk had them fight each other. In the end the Hulk spared them, declaring he intended justice and not murder. The Hulk planned to destroy New York City and leave the Illuminati to their shame. Soon, a nearly insane [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] arrived on the scene and a cataclysmic battle ensued between him and the Hulk. Sentry unleashed forces that nearly destroyed what was left of New York, but ultimately, it was a stalemate between the two. The Hulk then briefly reverted to Bruce Banner, and the Sentry reverted to Bob Reynolds. In their human forms, Bruce Banner was able to knock out Bob Reynolds.{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 4|5}}

Warbound member [[Miek (Earth-616)|Miek]] impaled the Hulk's longtime friend Rick Jones, and revealed that he had intentionally allowed the mass deaths on Sakaar to happen, knowing they were caused by former followers of the Red King and not the Illuminati. The Hulk and the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] [[No-Name (Earth-616)|No-Name]] attacked Miek in retaliation. Betrayed and enraged, the Hulk unwillingly began releasing energy that threatened the Eastern Seaboard, and prompted Tony Stark to activate a series of satellite devices that opened fire and eventually left the Hulk in his Bruce Banner form, whom the devices rendered unconscious. S.H.I.E.L.D. imprisoned Banner in a facility three miles underground, and the other Warbound members were placed under U.S. custody.{{r|World War Hulk #5}}

===Red Hulk incident===
While Banner was incarcerated at Gamma Base, a new mystery revealed itself when the Abomination was found murdered in his homeland of Russia. The perpetrator soon revealed himself as a massive creature referring to itself as the [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]]. This new incarnation of the Hulk decimated the likes of the She-Hulk, Iron Man, Rick Jones in his new powered-up identity of a creature named A-Bomb, and even Thor.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 5}}

Banner was set free when the clash between the Red Hulk and A-Bomb caused an earthquake that damaged his prison. The potential threat to Banner's life triggered his transformation into the original green Hulk, and he wasted no time in confronting his new nemesis. The Hulk, caught unprepared for the Red Hulk's fighting style, was defeated in their first meeting and suffered a broken arm in the process, but the outcome was much different during their second meeting where the Hulk found a potential weakness in the Red Hulk and exploited it. Once the Red Hulk was beaten, the Hulk left without finding out the Red Hulk's true identity; however, Banner began spending his time trying to track down the Red Hulk before he could do more damage. On his journey, Banner ended up in Las Vegas where the Hulk had to team up with [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]], [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]], [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]], and even [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Brother Voodoo]] to quell a pack of [[Wendigo (Race)|Wendigo]] from devouring everyone inside a casino.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 #7|9}}

===Skaar===
Meanwhile, on Sakaar, the Hulk's thought-dead son, [[Skaar (Earth-616)|Skaar]], had risen. Skaar was progeny of Hulk and Caiera the Oldstrong. After Caiera's death a cocoon containing Skaar fell into the lake of fire. After a period of time, Skaar emerged from the cocoon, appearing to be the age equivalent to a human preteen. He quickly grew into what seemed to be an adult. Skaar wanted revenge on the Hulk because he felt the Hulk had abandoned him and his world to death.{{r|Skaar: Son of Hulk Vol 1 1}}

Skaar was exiled from his planet and was warped to Earth. Skaar confronted his father, who was then in his savage persona. Skaar was disgusted with his father's diminished intelligence. The Hulk engaged Skaar in a fight, which created a fissure that endangered a nuclear power plant. The Warbound were trying to prevent a nuclear catastrophe when they were unexpectedly aided by the Hulk and Skaar. Skaar, using the [[Glossary:Old Power|Old Power]], sealed the containment building and saved the workers at the plant. Skaar subsequently impaled the Hulk and left, claiming he would come back when he was worth killing.{{r|Skaar: Son of Hulk Vol 1 12}}

===Defenders vs. Offenders===
Sometime later, the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] came to the Hulk with a proposition: if the Hulk chose to participate in a game and won, Grandmaster would bring his love, Jarella, back to life. The Hulk agreed, and was told he could pick a group of allies to aid him in the game. The Hulk chose his former teammates in the Defenders: Namor the Silver Surfer, and Doctor Strange. When the time came to meet their opponents, the Collector appeared with the Hulk's nemesis, the Red Hulk, and his team -- consisting of [[Karl Mordo (Earth-616)|Baron Mordo]], [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax]], and [[Todd Arliss (Earth-616)|Tiger Shark]] -- and known as the [[Offenders (Earth-616)|Offenders]]. The Grandmaster gave the Savage Hulk Bruce Banner's mind and had each team member transported to the times and places from which the Hulk had gathered the Defenders. The Hulk faced off against the Red Hulk in [[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantis]], where the Red Hulk pierced the Hulk's heart with a cosmic energy-charged trident. The Hulk was eventually revived by the Grandmaster, after which he knocked out the Red Hulk with one punch.{{r|{{cl|Hulk Vol 2 10}}-[[Hulk Vol 2 12|12]]}}{{r|Hulk Vol 2 10|12}}

===Hulk no more===
Afterwards, Banner was captured by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], and was detained underneath Gamma Base to be used to create a gamma-powered super-soldier program, headed by [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]] and backed by General Ross. M.O.D.O.K. was responsible for the creation of the Red Hulk, Rick Jones' transformation into A-Bomb, and the evil split personality of Doc Samson. The plot was uncovered by the She-Hulk. To infiltrate an A.I.M. base, Jennifer recruited reporter [[Benjamin Urich (Earth-616)|Ben Urich]] to help uncover the truth, and Urich, in turn, recruited Peter Parker to aid in the photography. A battle soon ruptured the tank containing Banner, causing him to transform into the Hulk. When the two Hulks clashed, the Red Hulk used his radiation absorption abilities to steal the gamma energy from inside the Hulk, preventing him from ever becoming the Hulk again. As the base reached critical mass, the defenseless Bruce Banner was rescued by a now-intelligent A-Bomb.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 600}}

In the aftermath of the explosion, [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] sent [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]] to learn if Banner could still turn into the Hulk. When Ares attacked Banner, Rick rushed to his defense, but was quickly defeated. Ares was soon outsmarted by Banner, and he was locked inside a room built to hold the Hulk. After evading Ares, Bruce and Rick parted ways.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 13}}

===Training Skaar===
Banner confronted Skaar in the [[Mojave Desert]]. After much deliberation, Skaar grudgingly agreed to allow Bruce Banner to train him on how to defeat the Hulk, should he ever return.{{r|Incredible Hulk #601}} Bruce lured the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] into fighting Skaar,{{r|Incredible Hulk #602}} and then [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #603}} Soon after, the pair encountered [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Femme Fatales (Earth-616)|Femme Fatales]], [[Victoria Hand (Earth-616)|Victoria Hand]] and [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]].{{r|Dark Reign: The List - Hulk #1}} Bruce discovered Betty Ross was alive, and was immediately attacked by a Harpy who turned out to be Marlo Chandler.{{r|Incredible Hulk #604}} The pair come to the aid of the Fantastic Four, who were in the middle of a battle with the Mole Man and later Tyrannus.{{r|Incredible Hulk #605}} Later on, Bruce saved Skaar from Doctor Doom.{{r|Incredible Hulk #606}} Bruce and Skaar tried to protect Hank Pym from the Leader, but in this, they failed.

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Incredible Hulk Vol 1 610 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce absorbing Gamma Radiation and Cosmic Radiation.]]
Bruce then assembled his own group of Avengers to try and save Betty.{{r|Incredible Hulk #607}} Betty, who was angry with him for having married another woman, was used by the Leader to distract Bruce so that he could "hulkify" many A.I.M. marines and heroes. Bruce was captured by the Leader and hooked up to a virtual reality machine.{{r|Incredible Hulk #608}} He was unwilling to leave the virtual world until he was convinced by Doctor Doom, who was also trapped. When Bruce escaped, he was saved from Doctor Doom by the Red She-Hulk, who was stabbed by Skaar and turned out to be Betty herself.{{r|Incredible Hulk #609}} The Leader escaped and the [[Cathexis Ray Generator]] machinery was reversed, and all the radiation from the Hulked-Out Heroes returned back to the Helicarrier. Bruce then absorbed all the energy to contain it at the behest of Reed Richards. Doc Samson died trying to help. The Helicarrier crashed, and from the rubble, there emerged a new incarnation of the Hulk, who came to be called the Worldbreaker Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk #610}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Incredible Hulk Vol 1 610 0002.jpg|thumb|318px|Return of the Worldbreaker]]
Skaar had his chance to fight the Hulk at last. During the confrontation, the Hulk rescued innocent bystanders endangered by their fight. Skaar reacted to this act of compassion by ceasing his assault, but the Hulk continued his, causing Skaar to revert to human form. The Hulk was reminded of Banner's own abusive father and reverted to human form as well, recognizing that he would never be able to continue that fight without Bruce becoming Brian Banner. Banner apologized and embraced his son, and Skaar accepted his love.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 611}}

===Scorched Earth===
The Red Hulk set himself up in the [[White House]], planning to take over America. However, the Hulk showed up to foil his plan. After having Ross imprisoned in Gamma Base, Steve Rogers released him to stop the Leader's and M.O.D.O.K.'s joint contingency plan, called Scorched Earth. Banner was put in charge of countering the program and learned how to shut it down with clues from the depowered M.O.D.O.K.. Banner assisted the Red Hulk and shut down the Living Supercomputer running Scorched Earth, not knowing that this was a distraction created by M.O.D.O.K to cover the trail of his cloned successor, [[M.O.D.O.K. Superior (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K Superior]].{{r|Hulk Vol 2 25|29}}

===The Hulk Family===
The Hulk family, composed of Skaar, Korg, A-Bomb, the Hulk, the She-Hulk, the Savage She-Hulk, and the Red She-Hulk all went into seclusion, ignoring the attempts of the government to bring them out of hiding. The Hulk's other son, and Skaar's twin, [[Hiro-Kala (Earth-616)|Hiro-Kala]], set his sights on Earth, planning to destroy it with the planet K'ai. Hiro-Kala was confronted by his father. Skaar used his own old power to seal Hiro-Kala in a sphere of stone. Hiro-Kala was merged with the Worldmind to create a miniature sun, to use the Old Power to warm K'ai.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 612|617}}

===Heart of the monster===
After a wishing well's power was unleashed, the Hulk found himself facing some of his mightiest foes. One of them was the alien warlord [[Arm'Cheddon (Earth-616)|Arm'Cheddon]]. He defeated and depowered the She-Hulk and A-Bomb as part of his revenge scheme against the Hulk. He then revealed that he had reconfigured his power-channeling abilities so that he could channel the Hulk's energy; the stronger the Hulk got, the stronger '''''he''''' got. When the [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Red She-Hulk]] interfered with the conflict, he hit her with the full force of his power. In a rage, the Hulk defeated Arm'Cheddon.{{r|Incredible Hulks Vol 1 632}}

===[[Fear Itself]]===
[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) and Sanjay (Earth-616) from Fear Itself Hulk vs. Dracula Vol 1 2 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Nul, Breaker of Worlds.]]
When the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]] was freed by [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Skadi]], he called seven hammers to Earth.{{r|Fear Itself Vol 1 1}} The Hulk was transformed by one of these hammers, becoming one of the Worthy: [[Nul]], Breaker of Worlds.{{r|Fear Itself Vol 1 2}} Rampaging through [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], which led to a conflict with the Avengers.{{r|Fear Itself Vol 1 3}}{{r|Avengers Vol 4 15}} Nul was eventually transported to [[New York City]] where, teaming with the [[Angrir (Earth-616)|Angrir]]-possessed Thing, the two began battling a lonesome Thor.{{r|Fear Itself Vol 1 4}} After defeating the Thing, Thor stated that he never could beat the Hulk, and instead removed him from the battle by launching him into [[Earth Orbit]], after which Thor collapsed from exhaustion.{{r|Fear Itself Vol 1 5}} Landing in [[Romania]], Nul immediately began heading for the base of the [[Vampires|vampire]]-king [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]]. Opposed by Dracula's forces, including a legion of monsters, Nul was seemingly unstoppable.{{r|Fear Itself: Hulk vs. Dracula #1}} Only after the intervention of [[Raizo Kodo (Earth-616)|Raizo Kodo]]'s [[Forgiven (Earth-616)|Forgiven]] was Nul briefly slowed.{{r|Fear Itself: Hulk vs. Dracula #2}} Ultimately, Nul made his way to Dracula's castle where the timely arrival of Kodo and Forgiven member [[Inka (Earth-616)|Inka]], disguised as Betty Ross, was able to throw off the effects of the Nul possession. Throwing aside the hammer, the Hulk regained control, and promptly left upon realizing "Betty's" true nature.{{r|Fear Itself: Hulk vs. Dracula #3}} Claiming that he wanted to be alone, the Hulk somehow appeared to separate himself from Bruce Banner and disappeared.{{r|Fear Itself Vol 1 7}}

===Asunder===
In truth, the Hulk resorted to Doctor Doom to separate himself from Bruce Banner, resulting in him removing the portion of the brain controlled by Banner and moving it to a gamma-free cloned body of [[Bruce Banner (Doom's Clone) (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]].{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 5|6}} The Hulk moved underground, where he lived with a tribe of [[Moloids]] until [[Amanda von Doom (Earth-616)|Commander Amanda von Doom]] contacted him for help to hunt an insane Bruce Banner.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 1}}

The Hulk helped the [[Mad Squad (Earth-616)|Mad Squad]] (Doom's team) to assault an island which Banner used as a base, where he was creating gamma-mutated animals in a series of experiments to become the Hulk again. The attack resulted in Banner's vaporization in a gamma bomb, which resulted in Bruce Banner again sharing the Hulk's mind, but still with his insane mind, and the Hulk refused to have any memories of his time as Banner. With the transformation shifted so that the Hulk was the 'dominant' persona, reverting to Banner when he became too calm, Bruce Banner led the Hulk to a journey in different locations around the world, including an old Russian space station, the [[City of Sasquatches]]; there, he protected the [[Sasquatch (Race)|Sasquatch]] from [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]], and an old S.H.I.E.L.D. base, which ended with the Hulk waking up strapped to a chair with a needle pointed above him and Banner talking on a video screen. The recording of Banner revealed that he had finally discovered the cure for the Hulk, the components of which being what the Hulk had been gathering throughout his "journey;" however, Banner also revealed that he was no longer interested in controlling the Hulk, having come to recognize that he was a better person with the Hulk than he would have been without him. This prompted the two personas to join forces again to investigate Doom's latest plan, using the gamma cure that Banner had devised to restore the animals on Banner's former island headquarters to normal.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 13}}

===Weapon of S.H.I.E.L.D.===
Bruce's reunion with his persona as the Hulk caused a reversion of the Hulk's intelligence. While spending time alone in the American desert, the Hulk was caught in the middle of a conflict between the army and [[Aquarius (Thanos' Zodiac) (Earth-616)|Aquarius]] of the [[Zodiac (Thanos') (Earth-616)|Zodiac]].{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 1}} The Hulk brought the Avengers a piece of Aquarius' suit that he had torn from the villain to investigate his identity, and he remained with the Avengers to confront the Zodiac,{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 2}} as well as [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos the Mad Titan]], who revealed himself to be the group's master.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 #3|8}} The Hulk additionally assisted the Avengers during their [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|war]] against [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and the [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]].{{r|{{cl|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 #11}}-[[Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 #12|12]]}}

[[File:Indestructible Hulk Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
After officially returning to the Avengers' ranks,{{r|Avengers Vol 5 1}} Bruce Banner approached S.H.I.E.L.D. to offer them a new way to put both his and the Hulk's abilities at their service. Bruce's intelligence could be used to create new technology for the betterment of humanity, and the Hulk's strength would be used against S.H.I.E.L.D.'s enemies. During his tenure working for S.H.I.E.L.D., the Hulk battled the [[Quintronic Man (Earth-616)|Quintronic Man]]{{r|Indestructible Hulk Vol 1 1}} and the [[Agence Byzantine (Earth-616)|Byzantine]].{{r|Indestructible Hulk Vol 1 9}} The Hulk even became part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secret splinter branch named [[Temporal Irregularity Management and Eradication (Earth-616)|T.I.M.E.]] to fight a group of time-travelers called the [[Chronarchists (Multiverse)|Chronarchists]], who intended to reknit history in their image.{{r|Indestructible Hulk Vol 1 11}}

===Becoming Doc Green===
One of Bruce's own S.H.I.E.L.D. assistants, [[Melinda Leucenstern (Earth-616)|Melinda Leucenstern]], shot him in the head on orders of the [[Brotherhood of the Shield (Earth-616)|Ancient Order of the Shield]] because they determined he was going to cause an extinction-level event.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 8}} Having suffered severe brain damage,{{r|Hulk Vol 3 1}} Bruce was eventually cured by Tony Stark using the [[Extremis virus]], which further increased Bruce's mental capacity as a side effect.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 4}} Not long afterwards, the Hulk and many other heroes were exposed to countless secrets kept by the late [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu the Watcher]].{{r|Original Sin Vol 1 2}} The vision he witnessed made Bruce mistakenly believe that Stark was responsible for him becoming the Hulk, since he had secretly tampered with the shielding of the Gamma Bomb on behalf of General Ross.{{r|Original Sin Vol 1 3.2}} As part of his misguided revenge attempt against Iron Man, Bruce used his new intellect to tweak the Extremis dose in his body and unleash a new persona for the Hulk, the super-intelligent Doc Green.{{r|Original Sin Vol 1 3.2}} Doc Green made peace with Tony after learning that the Gamma Bomb's original shielding had been over-bolstered, and thus Tony's tampering had actually refined the bomb's explosive potential so that it would not disintegrate everyone within the blast radius, with the result having been that Tony's actions had actually saved Bruce's life.{{r|Original Sin Vol 1 3.4}}

[[File:Hulk Vol 3 6 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|As Doc Green]]
After coming to the conclusion that the world was in danger due to its many Gamma mutates, Doc Green determined that they needed to be neutralized. He developed a serum made from Adamantium nanobots that absorbed gamma energy{{r|Hulk Vol 3 5}} and used it to depower A-Bomb,{{r|Hulk Vol 3 6}} [[Skaar (Earth-616)|Skaar]],{{r|Hulk Vol 3 7}} [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Red She-Hulk]],{{r|Hulk Vol 3 8}} the [[Gamma Corps (Earth-616)|Gamma Corps]],{{r|Hulk Vol 3 12}} and finally, the Red Hulk.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 15}} The only Gamma mutate Doc Green did not depower was the She-Hulk, since he determined she was the only Gamma mutate whose life had been genuinely improved by her condition. Doc Green additionally realized that his intellect was slowly declining and would eventually return to its normal levels, those of the original primality of the Hulk.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 16}}

===Immortal Hulk===
When an experimental fusion reactor started melting down, Bruce used the Hulk to absorb all of its radiation.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 1}} However, the new type of radiation being used on the plant threatened to cause the Hulk to detonate. The Hulk's friend Amadeus Cho assisted the Hulk, and in the process of saving his life, he used special nanites to transfer Banner's powers to himself.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 4}} Even though he had become effectively gamma-free,{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 6}} Bruce started experimenting on himself with gamma-irradiated cells at his laboratory in Utah.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 3}} Bruce's experiments caused him to become the target of one of the visions of an [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] precognitive named [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses Cain]], who foretold that Bruce would eventually transform into the Hulk and cause an onslaught.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 2}} When a contingent of superheroes confronted Bruce Banner about the vision, they learned of his experiments. Banner became agitated, and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] shot him in the head with an arrow equipped with a special custom-built tip.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 3}} It was eventually revealed during Hawkeye's trial that the arrow tip had been provided by Bruce Banner himself, and he had requested Clint to shoot him if it even became apparent that he would again transform into the Hulk.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 15 001.jpg|thumb|left|Temporarily resurrected by the Hand]]
Bruce's body was stolen by the ninja clan known as [[Hand (Earth-616)|The Hand]] shortly after his funeral.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 14}} The [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]] attempted to stop The Hand's resurrection ritual, but arrived too late.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 15}} Following a brief confrontation, the rampage of the Hulk, now again mindless, was finally contained within a magical doorway of Voodoo's creation, which allowed the sorcerer to enter Banner's soul and cleanse it from the Hand's corruption. Banner reverted to his human form and died in the process.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 17}} When [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] took over the United States by the hand of an evil doppelganger of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America]], head scientist [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]] resurrected Bruce Banner to use the Hulk in an assault against the resistance known as the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 5}} Even though Banner refused to assist Hydra, the side of him that was the Hulk complied with pleasure.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 6}} As a result of a time-delayed device Zola had implanted, the Hulk's resurrection was temporary. Shortly before the destruction of the Underground's base, The Mount, his body deteriorated and he again died.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 6}} Banner's body was left behind beneath the ruins of the Mount.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 679}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 684 001.jpg|thumb|Hulk's resurrection at the hands of the Challenger]]
The Hulk's third consecutive resurrection came by the hand of the [[Challenger (Elder of the Universe) (Earth-616)|Challenger]], an exiled [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elder of the Universe]] who had returned for a rematch against the Grandmaster. He related to the Hulk's rage, and brought him back to life to act as his ace in the hole during the final round of a contest between each of the Elders' teams, the [[Black Order (Earth-616)|Black Order]] and the [[Lethal Legion (Grandmaster) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]], whose objective had been to seize the [[Pyramoids]] deployed on Earth by their masters during each round.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 679}} The Hulk agreed to help the Challenger retrieve the final Pyramoid since the Earth was going to be destroyed as soon as the contest ended, and the Hulk saw it as a way to free himself of the nuisance of humanity.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 686}} By this time, Bruce Banner's persona, who had been overwhelmed by the Hulk's psyche, came to the realization that this succession of resurrections was not a coincidence, but simply a manifestation of the Hulk's innate immortality.

During the final round, the Hulk rampaged to the [[Avengers Auxiliary Headquarters]], where [[Va Nee Gast (Earth-616)|Voyager]], the Grandmaster's own secret agent within the Avengers, had teleported the final Pyramoid.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684}} The Hulk quickly defeated the Avengers that tried to stand on his way,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684}} and he even destroyed the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 685}} Even though the Hulk managed to make his way to the vault where Voyager was hiding the Pyramoid, [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] convinced him that the Challenger was as much at fault as the rest of humanity of not leaving him alone. When the Pyramoid was within his grasp, the Hulk destroyed it instead, costing the Challenger his victory.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 686}} Following the Challenger's defeat,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 689}} Banner went under the radar, with the resurrection of the Hulk becoming nothing more than a rumor to the general public.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 1}} Bruce started travelling the country aimlessly looking for ways to put the Hulk to use as a tool to bring justice in order to atone for his own sins.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 2}} Around this time, the predominant personality of the Hulk became that of the Devil Hulk, a repressed alter of Bruce who was articulate and spiteful, but was entirely devoted to protecting Bruce, whose transformation was triggered mostly only when injured or killed, and after sunset.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 15}}

===Shadow base===
Following his return, the Hulk was targeted by enemies in two fronts. The U.S. Hulk Operations, rebranded as Shadow Base and led by [[Reginald Fortean (Earth-616)|General Fortean]], set out to capture and analyze the Hulk,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 6}} while the demonic and otherworldly entity known as the [[One Below All (Multiverse)|One Below All]] began to use the soul of Bruce's father Brian to influence the land of the living from the [[Below-Place]], the deepest layer of reality even below [[Hell]] itself, and the secret source of gamma radiation.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 12}} It was because of this connection to the Below-Place that gamma mutates could be reborn, since they were plunged into the Below-Place after death, and could return to the real world through the metaphysical [[Green Door]] that connected both planes of existence.{{r|Immortal She-Hulk Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Immortal Hulk Vol 1 12 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Hulk facing the One Below All]]
Due to the machinations of the One Below All, Brian's soul possessed Bruce's former colleague Walter Langkowski, the gamma mutated Sasquatch.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 4}} The Hulk managed to stop the rampaging Sasquatch by draining him of his gamma energy, inadvertently absorbing Brian's possession as well.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 5}} Under Brian's influence, the Hulk traveled to the Los Diablos Military Base where he came to blows against the Absorbing Man, who had become a Shadow Base operative. By absorbing the Hulk's gamma energy, Creel became possessed by Brian,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 9}} who used him to absorb all the residual gamma radiation from the gamma bomb's detonation, opening a Green Door that plunged him and the Hulk into the Below-Place, as well as a third party interested in the Hulk also present at the scene, the task force [[Gamma Flight (Alpha Flight Space Program) (Earth-616)|Gamma Flight]].{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 10}} In the Below-Place, the Hulk and Bruce Banner were split apart,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 11}} and Brian attempted to make of Bruce the One Below All's new vessel to bring the Below-Place to Earth. After making his way through the One Below All's demons,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 12}} the Hulk managed to foil Brian's plans once Gamma Flight member [[Eugene Judd (Earth-616)|Puck]] convinced the Absorbing Man to make things right. The Absorbing Man funneled gamma energy into the Hulk, giving him the strength to disperse the One Below All with a single thunderclap. Afterward, the Hulk merged back with Bruce and closed the Green Door, returning everybody to Earth.

Due to the traumatic experience in the Below-Place, Bruce reached out to Betty Ross, with whom he hadn't established contact since returning from the dead.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 13}} [[Carl Burbank (Earth-616)|Bushwacker]], a Shadow Base operative on Bruce's trail, killed Betty when she was reunited with Bruce,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 14}} triggering a transformation into a red form of the vicious Harpy.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 18}} In the turmoil of Betty being shot, the Hulk was approached by Doc Samson, who had also returned to life through the Green Door and sought Bruce for answers about it. Together with Samson, the Hulk investigated Shadow Base and the disappearance of the body of Rick Jones, who had died during Hydra's short-lived empire.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 15}} In a confrontation with Bushwacker, Bruce manifested his Joe Fixit persona, albeit with no accompanying physical transformation.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 16}} While hiding from Shadow Base, Bruce was attacked by a mutated Rick Jones, turned into Abomination by his pursuers.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 18}} With Harpy's help, the Hulk managed to evade Shadow Base and dig up Rick Jones from the mutagenic shell that had turned him into Abomination.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 20}} While in hiding, Bruce investigated the disappearance of General Ross' body, suspecting it to be the work of Shadow Base. As a result, he became tangled in the efforts of [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]] to stop [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]] from awakening an ancient [[Symbiotes (Race)|symbiote]] god named [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] by retrieving the traces of symbiotes left in the bodies, dead or alive, of anybody who had ever been bonded to one.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Immortal Hulk Vol 1 1}} For a brief time, the Venom symbiote chose the Hulk as a host in an attempt to stop Carnage,{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 3}} but his gambit failed and Carnage managed to defeat him.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 4}} Carnage would be subsequently killed by Venom.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5}}

[[File:Immortal Hulk Vol 1 26 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|In control of Shadow Base]]
When Rick awoke, he shared with Bruce and his allies the location of the Shadow Base's headquarters. They assaulted Shadow Base,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 22}} joining forces with Gamma Flight in the process, who were coincidentally raiding the facility at the same time.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 23}} The Hulk confronted and killed General Fortean, who had used the Abomination tissue on himself. In the aftermath, Banner seized command of Shadow Base's assets,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 24}} and set out to use its resources to wage war on the human world for their abuse of the environment, sparking a counterculture movement in the process that embraced his ideals.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 26}}

===Ascension of the Leader===
Unbeknownst to Bruce, the Leader had been studying the Below-Place and managed to replace Brian as the host of the One Below All. Sterns had additionally infiltrated Bruce Banner's circles, having taken control of Rick Jones' mind and having infiltrated Bruce's mindscape by taking over his Green Scar alter.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 39}} During his war against the human world, the Hulk combated [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]].{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 27}} In an attempt to rid of the Hulk, Roxxon's CEO [[Dario Agger (Earth-616)|Dario Agger]] enlisted the help of [[Xemnu (Earth-616)|Xemnu]],{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 28}} who used his hypnosis to brainwash the world into believing that he was the one true Hulk and everybody's hero.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 32}} In order to stop Roxxon's interference, the Leader, as the Green Scar, helped the Hulk fight back and put an end to Xemnu's brainwashing, while also caging the Devil Hulk persona within Banner's mindscape. Due to this, Savage Hulk became the Hulk's main manifestation again.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 33}}

The Leader eventually made his move when he used Rick Jones to overload the Hulk with gamma, causing him to decimate a town where he was present.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 35}} While the Hulk was fending off Gamma Flight to avoid capture,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 36}} the Leader tightened his hold over Banner's mindscape, subduing Bruce and Fixit as well. Devil Hulk managed to break free when the Leader attempted to bring Bruce to the Below-Place,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 38}} but the ill-timed intervention of the childish Savage Hulk to stop the conflict resulted in Sterns seemingly killing the manifestation of the Devil Hulk alter. Savage Hulk and Joe Fixit were left behind in Banner's body, which was being held prisoner by Gamma Flight aboard the [[Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station]]. In the Below-Place, Leader hooked Banner and the remains of the Devil Hulk to plant-like structures for some unrevealed purpose.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 39}}

Hulk was later met by Henry Gyrich, who was acting commander of the Alpha Flight Interstellar Defense and Diplomacy Initiative, which included authority of Gamma Flight. Gyrich informed Hulk that he would get to decide what happened to him. He also told Hulk that the manacles that held him could adjust in size, thus becoming Banner wouldn't get him free. Joe Fixit, however, was able to transform into Banner by emerging from the Hulk's body like a cocoon. Joe then knocked out Gyrich and the guards that were with him. While trying to escape, Joe was confronted by Gamma Flight and Doc Samson, resurrected in Walter Langkowski's body. Joe then used a gun he took from one of the guard to break open the space station's window and flee into outer space. Joe transformed into Savage Hulk, allowing him to withstand the reentry through Earth's atmosphere. Hulk landed near Coney Island where he was confronted by the Thing as he got ashore.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 40}} Thing battled Hulk until Hulk transformed into Banner and the Joe Fixit persona convinced Thing to stop. The two then talked it out, and Thing decided to let Hulk go.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 41}}

===On the run===
Joe Fixit and Savage Hulk went into hiding in [[New York City]]. Savage Hulk had been greatly weakened after having his gamma energy drained by the Leader after he took Banner and the Devil Hulk. So, Joe Fixit used thievery and scams to survive and tried to avoid becoming a hero so he didn't draw attention to himself. After witnessing two police officers harass a member of the [[Teen Brigade (Earth-616)|Teen Brigade]], however, Joe Fixit decided to be a hero and transformed into Savage Hulk to aid the teen. After scaring off the police officers, Hulk was attacked by the U-Foes who were hired by Henry Gyrich to take him out.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 43}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Immortal Hulk Vol 1 45 002.jpg|thumb|left|Cosmically-powered Hulk]]
The U-Foes took turns attacking Hulk, but when [[Simon Utrecht (Earth-616)|Vector]] accidentally sent Hulk flying all the way to New Jersey with a telekinetic attack, the U-Foes searched for him. After finding Hulk, [[James Darnell (Earth-616)|X-Ray]] finished Hulk off with a blast of anti-gamma rays ([[Glossary:Cosmic Radiation|cosmic rays]]), killing him. Savage Hulk and Joe Fixit both were sent to Below-Place and found themselves staring down an enlarged Leader, who was possessed by the One Below All.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 44}}

The Leader trapped Savage Hulk and Joe in the Below-Place by turning the Green Door into the Red Door and then sent various Qlippoth against Savage Hulk and Joe in an attempt to assimilate them. Unexpectedly, as X-Ray of the U-Foes bombarded Hulk's corpse with cosmic rays to prevent him from resurrecting, Joe Fixit was transformed into a Red Hulk and used his newfound power to smash through the Red Door, allowing him and Savage Hulk to escape. Joe then resurrected in the body of the Savage Hulk, no longer emaciated and with cosmic power running through him, much to the shock of the U-Foes.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 45}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) and Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616) from Immortal Hulk Vol 1 47 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Hulk and Betty make up]]
With his strength restored, Joe easily overwhelmed the U-Foes to the point where Vector was forced to send Joe flying toward Manhattan with his telekinesis to save him and his team. After learning the U-Foes had let the Hulk get away, Gyrich swallowed his pride and asked the Avengers for help. The Avengers confronted Joe at a bar where he was having a few drinks. As the Avengers were about to battle Hulk, Betty as the Harpy appeared to aid Hulk.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 46}} Later, Gamma Flight appeared to aid Hulk as well. During the fight, She-Hulk unexpectedly turned on her fellow Avengers to aid her cousin after learning from Betty that she also seen the Green Door. Gamma Flight eventually teleported away with Betty, She-Hulk, and Joe to a warehouse in Brooklyn formerly operated by the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]]. Joe and Betty then decided to make up and kiss.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 47}}

Later, Joe and Betty had intercourse in a hotel room. The two then had a heart-to-heart talk where Joe admitted he left Bruce Banner in the Below-Place and Betty revealed that she liked how Joe never hid anything from her but became upset after remembering that he used to be a criminal enforcer in Las Vegas. Tired of Bruce and his personas keeping secrets from her, Betty decided to leave again. Joe then talked with She-Hulk and Jackie, telling them he was done hiding and planned to rescue Bruce Banner from the Below-Place.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 48}}

Joe, Jen, and Jackie went to the Baxter Building to meet with the Fantastic Four and the Avengers. After a brief fight between Joe and the Avengers and other heroes, the Fantastic Four intervened and escorted Joe, Jen, and Jackie to the [[Forever Gate]], which had the ability to send Joe to the Below-Place to rescue Bruce Banner. Joe was reluctant to pass through at first, but he was motivated to by Jackie who passed through the Forever Gate with him.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 49}}

After arriving to the Below-Place, Joe Fixit and Savage Hulk separated into different beings and journeyed with Jackie through the Below-Place until they came across a fortress the Leader built to protect himself. Savage Hulk entered first and later Joe and Jackie. Joe and Savage Hulk fought a monstrously transformed Leader but were quickly overwhelmed. After coming to terms with her past, Jackie unleashed a beam of energy from her eyes that hurt the Leader, allowing Joe and Savage Hulk to separate the Leader from the One Below All and rescuing Bruce Banner. After confronting the One Below All who turned out to be an aspect of the One Above All who cryptically told them the purpose of the Hulk, Joe, Savage Hulk, and Jackie fled the Leader's crumbling fortress with Leader and Banner. They were then met by the Thing and Walt Langkowski resurrected in Doc Samson's body and traveled back to Earth using the Forever Gate. Banner merged back with Joe Fixit and Savage Hulk, and after receiving clothing from Reed Richards snuck out of the Baxter Building and into the outside world.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 50}}

==Personality==
{{Quote|When I was four, I saw [[Brian Banner (Earth-616)|my father]] kill [[Rebecca Banner (Earth-616)|my mother]]. And years later, I killed him. I didn't '''mean''' to. But I did it. I've got '''that''' kind of anger inside. '''That''' kind of capacity. But you... you have your own problems. And your Hulk's gonna have his own problems as a result. And you may not love everything you learn about yourself. But you're not a... you're not a monster. You're not me, [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus]]. You're not me.|Bruce Banner}}

Bruce Banner suffered severe trauma as a child inflicted by his father, and repressed it in his subconsciousness. This abuse resulted in the young Bruce Banner developing dissociative identity disorder and the early emergence of several alternate personalities.{{r|Immortal Hulk #26}} Indeed, each aspect of his complex mind represents a peculiar manifestation of Banner's multifaceted psyche.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Hulk 2004 Vol 1 1}} This was compounded later in life by the traumatic explosion that triggered his initial transformation into the Hulk,{{r|Incredible Hulk #1}} and further stimulated the emergence of other aspects of his personality. Following his Gamma accident, many of his alters now take Hulk forms, though some, like Joe Fixit, can remain in human form when they switch.{{r|Immortal Hulk #35}}

It was revealed by Doctor Samson that exposure to concentrated levels of gamma energy brings about the expression of the deepest parts of the collective unconscious. In this process, the darkest, most deeply-buried sense of self dictates the subject's mutation. Particularly in the case of Bruce Banner, it stimulated the expression of a repressed fury that played an essential role in his transformation into the Hulk. Banner became an obsessive-compulsive person. He finally sublimated his grief and rage over his childhood, diverting the drives spawned by his sufferings into the relative safety of science.{{r|Incredible Hulk #393}}

Because of that, Banner is often trying to hide his emotional damage, resulting predominantly in social isolation. Banner became a highly withdrawn intellectual unable to cope with emotions.{{r|Incredible Hulk #393}} In the course os his life, Banner has also been pursued by the destruction that Hulk causes, what culminates in more complications in his life. However, Bruce Banner is a self-sacrificing and heroic person. Endowed with a super-genius intellect, he is also one of the most brilliant and resourceful minds on Earth. Banner is constantly undertaken his career as a superhero while trying to find a cure for his condition. 

Banner and Hulk are frequently portrayed as mutually hating each other, but at times Banner strategically acts in full synchrony and consonance with his Hulk persona, thus giving the Hulk a purpose. During the Planet Hulk and World War Hulk arcs, for example, both acted in full cooperation, and the Immortal Hulk even declared to cherish and care for the Banner persona after all. Banner has also stated that the Hulk's reasoning and intelligence tend to fluctuate depending upon a number of factors at the moment of transformation, resulting in the Hulk's standard persona varying from a raging monster to a more calculating fighter.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #10}}

==Incarnations==
{{Quote|You... can't... break... a... man... who's... already... been... broken.|Bruce Banner}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 19}}

[[File:Hulk Incarnations from Immortal Hulk Vol 1 18 001.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A simplified list of Hulk incarnations]]
The Hulk initially is characterized as a separate entity from Bruce Banner, a distillation of his human anger that gradually develops its own personality and memories separate from Banner's. Banner suffers from "Dissociative Identity Disorder," which stems from the abuse he suffered as a child. The Hulk has many incarnations, each representing a different aspect of Banner's psyche; there are hundreds or possibly thousands of other personalities of the Hulk, but only a few major versions have been seen to date.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Hulk 2004 Vol 1 1}}

*'''Bruce Banner''' - Bruce Banner is the emotionally repressed core personality, possessed of genius intellect. Banner can transform into the different versions of the Hulk, whereas his alter egos seem to be able only to transform into Bruce Banner.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Hulk 2004 Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Incredible Hulk Vol 2 75 Textless.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Savage Hulk]]
*'''Savage/Child Hulk''' - The Savage, or more accurately described, "Childlike" Hulk is the most common version of the Hulk, and is one of the earliest known alters, existing and fronting since Bruce was just six years old. It possesses the mental capacity and temperament of a young child and typically refers to himself in the third person.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 12}} The Savage Hulk is the reflection of the young child abused by his father, which is the source of extreme rage and resentment from which his dynamic strength is derived. Samson theorized that the Savage Hulk represents Banner's unfettered id, seat of his survival instincts and childhood desires, always trying to get his way. He is in a constant infantile state of narcissistic innocence, resulting in a simple-minded baby-talking creature seeing the world only as an extension of himself. The Savage Hulk is portrayed as a lonely childlike being longing for friendship, acceptance, and love.{{r|Incredible Hulk #393}} In fact, he is naive, innocent, and kind. He often claims that he wants to be left alone, but this is because he is constantly attacked without the capacity to understand why. He really wants to be liked and is very loyal to his friends. The Savage Hulk is usually depicted as green-skinned and heavily-muscled with a loping, ape-like gait. While in a functionally calm emotional state, or at least as calm as the Hulk can be, the Savage Hulk is stronger than the Gray Hulk. While angry, he has the potential for limitless strength, depending on the height of his temper.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Hulk 2004 Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Hulk Vol 2 7 0001.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Joe Fixit]]
*'''Gray Hulk/"Joe Fixit"''' - The Gray Hulk worked for a time as a Las Vegas enforcer called ''"Joe Fixit."'' The Gray Hulk has average intelligence, although he occasionally displays knowledge and intellectual ability normally associated with Banner. He is cunning, crafty, hedonistic, arrogant, and distant, with a hidden conscience; various psychological assessments of the Hulks have identified this Hulk as the personification of the moody teenager that Banner never allowed himself to be. In most of his Las Vegas appearances, he appeared only at night. According to the Leader, the Gray Hulk persona is strongest during the night of the new moon and weakest during the full moon. This aversion to sun/moon light vanished when the Gray Hulk's night-induced transformation trigger was later removed. Although he is the smallest of the Hulks, the Gray Hulk towers over the average human. He prefers to dress in tailored suits. Joe Fixit's base strength level is also the lowest of the three primary Hulk incarnations.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Hulk 2004 Vol 1 1}} Following the Devil Hulk's takeover of the other Hulk personas, Joe gained the ability to manifest in the body of Bruce Banner, with the only noticeable difference in appearance being Banner's eye color changing from brown to gray.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 16}} This form of Joe can operate during the day time, which has lead to his self-given nickname "Sunshine Joe."{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 22}} When Xemnu mentally attacked Banner, he mentally imprisoned the Gray Hulk in Banner's mindscape in amber.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 33}} After Xemnu was defeated, Gray Hulk was freed from his prison.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 35}} While down in the Below-Place, exposure to cosmic rays to Hulk's corpse unexpectedly allowed Gray Hulk to transform into a Red Hulk, presumably giving him the same powers as well as the ability to smash through the Red Door. He was also able to take over the body of the Savage Hulk.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 45}} After opening up to Betty, Joe express regret for being selfish in the past, especially for leaving Bruce Banner in the Below-Place. After Betty left, Joe decided to stop hiding and rescue Bruce Banner.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 48}} He eventually traveled to the Below-Place with Jackie McGee using the Forever Gate, rescued Banner, and reunited with him while also retaining his Red Hulk form.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 49|50}}

[[File:Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 1 Marvel '92 Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Merged Hulk]]
*'''Merged Hulk/"The Professor"''' - The Merged Hulk was the merger of the personalities of Banner and the Savage and Gray Hulks.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Hulk 2004 Vol 1 1}} The Merged Hulk was far more well-adjusted than most incarnations, as well as an associate and leader of the team of superheroic philanthropists called the [[Pantheon (Earth-616)|Pantheon]]. Despite his exaggerated musculature, the Merged Hulk had a relatively normal looking face, resembling that of Banner. The Merged Hulk is the largest of the three primary Hulk incarnations and he also possesses a higher base strength level. While in a calm emotional state, the Merged Hulk is stronger than the Savage Hulk in a calm state. However, unlike the other incarnations of the Hulk, Bruce Banner subconsciously installed a type of safeguard within this incarnation. Although in the beginning he was stated to get stronger with his rage,{{r|Incredible Hulk #379}} when the Merged Hulk's anger reaches a berserk level, he will transform back into Bruce Banner, though with the mind and personality of the Savage Hulk. From this point, he was stated to turn weaker as he got angrier.{{r|Incredible Hulk #425}} It is unknown if he would currently have this limitation or not. For a while the Merged Hulk was renamed "The Professor," and instead claimed to be Banner's good side, or ideal self, as a personality created by Doc Samson.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 16}} However, the creator of this incarnation apparently later retconned this as one of the reality distortions created by Nightmare.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 81}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Secret Empire Vol 1 6 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|"Unnamed" Hulk]]
*'''Unnamed Hulk''' - After being resurrected, a previously unseen Hulk persona emerged, full of mindless rage and bloodlust. He was defeated by the Avengers;{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 6}} and was suppressed by the Devil Hulk persona, who imprisoned him in the depths of Banner's sub-conscience.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 15}} However, due to the Devil Hulk having been recently imprisoned himself,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 33}} this unnamed Hulk persona may now be free.

*'''Savage Grey Hulk'''- During Banner's early transformations, the Grey Hulk appeared as a child-like savage creature that shared many aspects with the Savage Hulk, such as referring to himself in third person and having the temperament of a child. After a few nights, the Grey Hulk gained an average human intelligence. Some time later, the Savage Grey Hulk re-emerged during his encounter with the Distorter, with his rage preventing him to be controlled by the Distorter. Many years later, after the Hulk was caught in a gamma explosion, the Savage Grey Hulk re-emerged once again, but this time he destroyed part of Las Vegas and fought the Fantastic Four members The Thing and the Human Torch during his rampage.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Hulk 2004 Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 1 0004.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Gravage Hulk]]
*'''Gravage Hulk/Post-Heroes Return Hulk''' - The Gravage Hulk is a merger of the Savage and Gray Hulk personas. It was caused when Banner tried to have control over the Hulk's personality after using his Gamma Projector, but the experiment didn't fully worked and, while this Hulk possessed part of Banner's scientist knowledge, the Hulk still referred to Banner as a separate person.{{r|Incredible Hulk #6}} This Hulk persona displayed the cunning intellect of the Gray Hulk and the raw power of the Savage Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk #4}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 60}} He did not have the ability to grow stronger with his rage, but instead drew upon dimensional nexus energies to gradually increase his base level.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 60}}

*'''Mindless Hulk''' - [[Nightmare (Earth-616)|Nightmare]], in an attempt to find new ways to hurt his enemy Doctor Strange by going through his friends, penetrated Bruce Banner's mind and discovered his influence had an unexpected side effect; a new personality began to develop out of Banner's worst visions of the Hulk. At this period in Banner's life, he had just gained control over the Hulk's body, but was constantly on alert and terrified this was just temporarily, and that the Hulk, which he saw as nothing but a savage and destructive beast, would break free once more when the world least expected it. Far from being identical with the original Hulk, this version was based on a nightmarish imagination made of all of Banner's worst fears and ideas of his former alter ego. Nightmare continued to manipulate and increase his influence, allowing this dark incarnation to gradually rise to the surface. It finally became its own personality after Banner made his "psychic suicide," allowing it to break free of Banner's domination. Eventually, with the assistance of three creatures created by his subconscious, (Glow, Goblin, and Guardian), this Hulk gained the ability to speak and behave much less savagely. Since then, this personality has not been seen again, and it has been suggested that it is no longer a part of Banner's personality. A part of the Hulk, with the assistance of Doctor Strange, entered the Dimension of Nightmare as a similar manifestation as Mindless Hulk, threatening to kill him. Nightmare was forced to seek out Spider-Man's help, as this Hulk was destroying the whole domain. Spider-Man eventually pushed the Hulk into another realm, but he pulled Nightmare in with him. Nightmare has since been seen still alive, but this Hulk seems to have disappeared.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Hulk 2004 Vol 1 1}}

*'''Dark Hulk''' - The Dark Hulk was the result of [[Shanzar (Earth-616)|Shanzar]], a Sorcerer Supreme from his dimension, possessing his body. In this form, the Hulk had a black color to him and was more vicious. The Hulk was freed from this form when Shanzar was sent back to his dimension by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] and Bruce Banner's psyche.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 370}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) and Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616) from Hulk Vol 2 30 001.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Compound Hulk]]
*'''Compound Hulk''' - The Compound Hulk was the result of [[Impossible Man (Earth-616)|Impossible Man]] using his magic to fuse the Hulk and the Red Hulk into the Compound Hulk to fight [[Xemnu (Earth-616)|Xemnu]] and the [[Kluh (Earth-616)|Kluh]], a deformed intelligent clone of the Gray Hulk. After Xemnu and the Kluh were defeated, Impossible Man split the Compound Hulk back into the Hulk and the Red Hulk.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 30}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Indestructible Hulk Vol 1 14 0001.jpg|thumb|Hulk Squared]]
*'''Hulk Squared''' - The Hulk Squared was a powerful, yet brief incarnation of the Hulk. When the Hulk and the [[Recording Observation Bot (Earth-616)|R.O.B.]] that contained Bruce's consciousness went back in time to stop the Chronarchists, they had to go back to the day of the Hulk's origin.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #14}} When they did, the Hulk got bombarded with a double dose of Gamma Radiation and R.O.B. had to download his mind into the past Bruce Banner to prevent himself from being erased from the time stream. It is not known if the Hulk Squared, also known as the Uberhulk, was stronger than the Green Scar, but it appeared as if that was the case. He was so strong that he was able to unleash powerful shock waves just by waving his arms around. The Uberhulk's intelligence was like that of the Mindless Hulk's; never speaking a word, simply grunting and roaring. When Banner realized the severity of the situation he manipulated one of the Chronarchist's armor so that he could go back seconds before the Gamma Bomb exploded, exposing him to the gamma radiation again. He and the Uberhulk briefly fought before Bruce had to shatter the time barrier to snap time back to its status quo.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #15}}

*'''Doc Green/Omega Hulk''' - An incarnation similar to the Merged Hulk, as it retains Bruce Banner's intellect and the Hulk's vast strength. It was created when Bruce Banner tweaked the [[Extremis virus|Extremis]] which had repaired his brain. It is considerably powerful, being able to destroy [[Retreat (Tony Stark's Malibu Mansion)|Tony Stark's Mansion]] with a single thunderclap,{{r|Original Sin #3.3}} and resist sonic and repulsors powerful enough to power a continent.{{r|Original Sin #3.1}} This incarnation also fabricated a time tunnel platform to teleport into Kang's Trophy Room at the edge of time-space, and easily ripped apart pure [[Adamantium]] from an inert Ultron shell with his bare hands.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 5}} Doc Green has recurring dreams of his alternate realty counterpart's Maestro persona, potentially suggesting Doc Green is an early manifestation of Maestro.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 9}} However, the days of Doc Green's existence are counted. It was discovered that the effects of the Extremis virus were diminishing, and Doc Green's intellect was extremely slowly reverting back to his regular Hulk persona, and at some point in the future it would be no more.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 11}} Doc Green came up with an Extremis supplement that could maintain his intellect for decades, but decided not to use it, fearing it could ultimately unleash his [[Maestro]] persona.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 16}} By the time the universe was restored, the Doc Green persona had vanished, and the Hulk had returned to his regular self.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Avengers & X-Men AXIS Vol 1 4 cover.jpg|thumb|right|Kluh]]
*'''Kluh''' - When the moral axis of numerous heroes were inverted during the casting of a spell meant to defeat the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Onslaught]], the Hulk reverted from Doc Green to his simple-minded persona, but unleashed a new one called the "Kluh" who was filled with sadness after the Avengers confronted him when he tried to prevent them from killing. The Kluh described himself as "the Hulk's Hulk" and had black skin, red lines, and a white mohawk. This incarnation possessed incredible power: he easily defeated his fellow Avengers shortly after emerging,{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #4}} and hit Sam Alexander with enough force to send him flying from Arizona in the United States to Paris, France.{{r|Nova Vol 5 23}} As the Kluh, Banner possessed a normal intellect, spoke informally, and all he wanted was to cause destruction and "bathe in the blood of the innocent."{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #4}} When fighting Sam Alexander, the Kluh showed a tendency towards cannibalism, attempting to bite off and eat the young hero's arm.{{r|Nova Vol 5 23}} This persona was lost when the Hulk was reverted by the reversion spell cast by [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], while possessed by the spirit of [[Daniel Drumm (Earth-616)|Daniel Drumm]], and Doctor Doom.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 9}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) Incredible Hulks Vol 1 632 001.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Worldbreaker]]
*'''Green Scar/"The Worldbreaker"''' - The Hulk of World War Hulk is a cunning and more powerful version than the previous incarnations, for he is the enraged version of the "Gravage Hulk." His rage is at its most focused, due to meditation training by his ally Hiroim. This incarnation has extremely high durability, shrugging off attacks that have hurt his other incarnations. He has had training in combat arms, including [[glossary:B#Broadsword|broadswords]], [[glossary:S#Spears|spears]], and battle shields, and is a capable leader and strategist. Another source of the Green Scar's strength in comparison to other versions was his lack of inner conflict, if not alliance, with Bruce Banner. There were several instances where the Hulk and Banner worked together strategically, such as acting to disable Dr. Strange. Caiera, the Green Scar's wife, understood Banner as well, and both personalities loved her equally. This was the driving factor in the Banner/Hulk alliance. As a result of being caught in the explosion of the warp core of his ship which brought him to Sakaar, which destroyed the planet, the Green Scar's base level of strength was dramatically increased. While in a calm emotional state, he is the strongest primary incarnation.{{r|Marvel Fact Files #5}}<br>During a burst of unexplained anger from the Hulk in New York City, [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] attempted to slow down the angered Hulk with intense power; however, the Hulk proved to be resistant to the Professor's psionic effects.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #1}} The Green Scar reached a new level of anger at the end of World War Hulk, after his fellow Warbound Miek attempted to provoke him to destroy the world. At this level, he started to release huge amounts of gamma energy from within his body, devastating New York, and causing quakes across North America. It would have taken but a couple of footsteps from the Hulk to completely destroy the eastern seaboard. If he had not let himself be stopped, then he definitely would have lived up to his "Worldbreaker" title, and would have completely destroyed the Earth.{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 5}} After World War Hulk, Banner suppressed the Green Scar, preventing him from surfacing. He momentarily reappeared in battle with the Hulk's son Skaar, still identifying himself as the "Worldbreaker."{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 611}} He seems to have resurfaced after Bruce regained his Hulk powers, his anger tempered from its "Worldbreaker" levels by another confrontation with Skaar, and was proven even strong enough to take down the Red Hulk without much of a fight despite the Red Hulk continuously absorbing the Hulk's radiation to empower himself.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 24}} The Hulk lived up to his "Worldbreaker" title by destroying a world (from a direct collision with the Red She-Hulk) in the Dark Dimension.{{r|Incredible Hulks Vol 1 634}} The Green Scar chose to remain in Banner's mindscape and help Banner mentally heal. While talking with the Savage Hulk persona, the Green Scar showed an arrogant side. He chained up the Devil Hulk, believing that he was bossy like Banner's father Brian and refused to free the Gray Hulk from his amber prison, believing him to be weak.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 33}} It was later revealed that his arrogant persona was actually the Leader who had hollowed out the Green Scar and was the one who sealed away the Devil Hulk. He then left Hulk's psyche for the Below Place, taking Bruce with him.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 38}} Though Bruce was eventually rescued and later re-merged with Joe and the Savage Hulk as they passed through the Forever Gate, the Green Scar did not accompany them.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 50}}<!-- In the same issues, it is revealed that the Worldbreaker is simply the Green Scar without holding back. -->

[[File:Immortal Hulk Vol 1 2 Zaffino Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Devil Hulk]]
*'''Devil/Immortal Hulk''' - This variation of the Hulk persona originated as a response to Banner's need for a protective father figure. Due to his abusive childhood he was unable to imagine the idea of love without pain, so the Devil Hulk took the form of a demonic, reptilian monster within Banner's mind.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 19}}{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 15}}<br>
[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Incredible Hulk Vol 2 19 001.jpg|thumb|right100px|The Devil Hulk as he appeared in Bruce's mind]]
The trauma of Bruce's death during the [[Civil War II|Second Superhuman Civil War]]{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 3}} and subsequent resurrection{{r|Avengers Vol 1 679}} allowed the Devil Hulk to suppress the other Hulk personas and become the "dominant" Hulk; though the Savage Hulk persona can still resurface if he is enraged enough.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 12}}{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 15}}<ref name="Freaksugar">{{cite web|url=http://www.freaksugar.com/al-ewing-immortal-hulk-interview/|title=Al Ewing on Horror & Judgment in IMMORTAL HULK|work=Freaksugar|first=Jed|last=Keith|date=20 June 2018|accessdate=19 July 2018}}</ref> He is extremely articulate, smart and cunning. For the most part, he acts in response to people that cause harm to others, and dispenses judgment on them mercilessly.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 2}} Unlike previous Hulks, he is content to wait inside Bruce, possessing a measure of power over Banner previous Hulks didn't have.<ref name="Freaksugar"/> When Banner is in control, the Hulk manifests as a gut feeling that guides him through to his objectives.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 2}} In addition to the Hulk's transformation period being limited to nighttime, Bruce can't transform whenever he wants, or even at the first sign of trouble.<ref name="Freaksugar"/> The Hulk always manifests when Bruce is fatally injured, but only once the sun is down,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 1}} though he eventually overcame this weakness with help from Banner.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 27}} Like every Hulk incarnation, the Devil Hulk possessed enormous strength but is proportionately stronger than ever. Examples of his strength include giving Thor a skull fracture following up a severe concussion that left him out of the fight, sending She-Hulk flying for at least two miles in a single blow, tearing apart the latest Hulkbuster Armor devised by Iron Man, and overloading Black Panther's vibranium-based [[Panther Habit]]; which was thought to be impossible, all while possessed by the [[One Below All (Multiverse)|One Below All]].{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 7}} The Devil Hulk also has incredible regenerative power. He quickly healed a large hole blown through his torso,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 3}} as well as put his body back together after it was sliced into pieces while possessed by the One Below All. In order for a part of his body to heal, though, it seemingly needed to be in close proximity to other pieces, and despite being segmented, Hulk was still able to move the separate parts of his body,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 8}} similar to [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 9}} The Devil Hulk also has a desire to completely destroy human civilization, arguing that they're just one misstep away from annihilation anyway.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 15}} When Xemnu mentally attacked Banner, the Green Scar persona took advantage of the chaos created to chain up the Devil Hulk as he found the Devil Hulk to be bossy like Banner's father Brian.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 33}} It was revealed that the Green Scar was being controlled by the Leader at the time.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 38}} Despite expressing regret for letting Devil Hulk take him over, Bruce still wanted to free Devil Hulk.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 35}} The Devil Hulk eventually broke free of his prison after being angered by the mistreatment Leader gave to Banner and the Savage Hulk, but was later devoured by Sterns.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 38|39}} However, some time later in the below place, while Bruce was within the mouth of the transformed Samuel Sterns who was being possessed by the One Below All, Bruce started talking to Hulk and as he was bonded with the seeming remains of Devil Hulk, it's implied that Devil Hulk isn't completely gone. Bruce learned that Devil "left some room" in Joe Fixit because he had a hunch about Joe which lead to Joe being able to absorb and incorporate cosmic energy into his body to become a red hulk and smash through the red door that was previously barring them from returning to the living world.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 45}} After Bruce reunited with his other alters, he mentioned one other personality still active beyond Joe or the Big Guy, potentially referring to the Immortal Hulk.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 50}}

'''Gamma Radiation Physiology:''' Due to Bruce Banner being exposed to the [[Gamma Bomb]]'s radiation culminating in his transformation into a powerful monster,{{r|Incredible Hulk #1}} the Incredible Hulk was for several times described as one of the physically most powerful beings in the entire [[Earth-616|Marvel Universe]],{{r|Fantastic Four #167}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #112}}{{r|Defenders #113}} with the potential for limitless levels of strength and durability (which scales directly with his strength).{{r|Marvel Fact Files #8}} The Hulk, in the full exercise of his potential, was described as the most powerful regular humanoid,{{r|Incredible Hulk #235}} and his maximum known strength level ranges beyond the limits of virtually any other known humanoid being.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 5}}{{r|World War Hulk: Gamma Files #1}} The gamma radiation mutated his body and fortified his cellular structure, adding over 800 lbs of bone marrow and muscle tissues to his body.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 5}} Additionally, during times of stress the Hulk's adrenaline level escalates, causing a corresponding escalation of brute strength. Thus, the madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.{{r|Incredible Hulk #316}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 5}} Moreover, the Hulk was stated to be an [[Omega Level Threat]] by both the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]]{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #4}} and [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #692}} and even "the '''Original''' Omega Level Threat" by [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Gyrich]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #5}} At one point, the Hulk was stated to be the strongest hero in the world.{{r|Marvel Fact Files #5}} [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]'s intel also classified him as Power Level 10+{{r|Secret War From the Files of Nick Fury #1}} and as the Merged Hulk he was described as part of the '''Omega-class entities''' by [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #600}}

*'''Transformation:''' The process by which Banner usually transforms into the Hulk is presumably the result of the chemical catalyst, adrenaline (a.k.a. epinephrine). As in normal human beings, Banner's adrenal medulla secretes large amounts of adrenaline in time of fear, rage, or stress, which hormonally stimulates the heart rate, increases blood-sugar levels, and inhibits sensations of fatigue. Whereas the secretion heightens normal physical abilities in normal human beings, in Banner's case it triggers the complex chemical-extra-physical process that transforms him into the Hulk. The total time of transformation falls anywhere from twenty-five seconds to five minutes,{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 5}} depending on the initial adrenaline surge, which will be determined by the original stimulus.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 5}} Soon after the transformation, the amount of adrenaline in the Hulk will return to more normal, reduced levels.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 5}} However, there have been instances in which Banner became the Hulk without any discernible increase in heart rate or adrenal levels, suggesting that the true trigger mechanism into the Hulk is far more psychological than physical. When the Hulk transforms back into Banner, the excess muscle mass and energy is lost, presumably to the same place he derives it. As the Hulk's transformation is mostly a stress reaction, it is virtually impossible to attack, wound or sedate him in his human form without the Hulk erupting almost instantaneously in self-defense.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 1}} As gamma mutates and their appearance/abilities are affected by their minds to become "metaphor people";{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 13}} Banner's Hulk form, and to an extent his abilities, change depending on which Hulk/alter is in control. Joe Fixit is weaker but more intelligent and cunning while only coming out at night, the Green Scar is full of wrathful fury while being able to erupt with gamma energy, and the Devil Hulk is more attuned with the mystical nature of gamma allowing him to perform impossible feats like overloading Vibranium, being alive and able to move while dismembered, or smelling lies and seeing into people's souls.

* '''Unlimited Strength:''' The Hulk possesses the capacity for essentially limitless physical strength, growing exponentially towards infinity without never really reaching it.{{r|Tales to Astonish #73}}{{r|Secret Wars II #8}}{{r|Tales to Astonish #78}}{{r|Tales to Astonish #89}}{{r|Indestructible Hulk #1}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #198}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #228}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #238}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #15}}{{r|Silver Surfer #4}} In an interview, [[Jack Kirby]] revealed that since the conception of the character he intended the Hulk to have unlimited strength.<ref>[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=zeeDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=%22The+Hulk%27s+strength+is+unlimited%22&source=bl&ots=TVYtFJ8Ku9&sig=ACfU3U315bI3XXWpjGV5cczbD6RNC7p3Gw&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiulfL9-fTrAhVtposKHZlGC2gQ6AEwGHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Hulk's%20strength%20is%20unlimited%22&f=false Jack Kirby statements]</ref> In effect, upon actually estimating the Hulk's raw potential, the mighty cosmic entity [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] stated outright that the Hulk's strength is intrinsically limitless. The Hulk's uttermost potential is indeed unlimited.{{r|Secret Wars II #8}} This statement has also been endorsed by the cosmic entity [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]] upon probing Hulk's capacity.{{r|Tales to Astonish #89}} The Hulk's boundless strength was further supported by the [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]]'s calculations, which could not stipulate limits.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #1}} Moreover, the Hulk's maximum strength output has also been consistently classified as power without defined limits.{{r|Marvel Fact Files #8}} The Hulk's reputation extends beyond Earth, with [[Skrulls]] proclaiming him as the strongest mortal on Earth,{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 419}} and the supreme [[Glossary:Skyfather|Skyfather]] [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] reflecting that he is the strongest mortal that [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] has ever faced.{{r|Journey into Mystery #112}} However, each of the primary Hulk's personalities possess a base strength level. While functionally calm, the Gray Hulk is the weakest whereas the incarnation commonly referred to as the "Green Scar" is the physically strongest of all primary Hulk's incarnations. After being exposed to the energies from the exploding core of the ship that originally brought the Hulk to [[Sakaar]], the Green Scar's base strength level was dramatically increased. The persona known as the Immortal or Devil Hulk is also substantially stronger than most incarnations and presumably rivals the Green Scar, being able to effortlessly outclass the combined might of an Avengers team consisting of powerful characters.{{r|Immortal Hulk #7}} However, while in an enraged state, adrenaline surges through the Hulk's body, magnifying his extraordinary strength drastically beyond his standard levels. The Hulk's immeasurable raw strength is directly proportional to his level of rage, excitement, and stress. The Hulk also grows stronger the more radiation{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 105}}{{r|Hulk: Future Imperfect #2}}{{r|Fantastic Four #534}}{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #2}} and dark magic{{r|Darkness/Incredible Hulk Vol 1}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 82}} he catalyzes. Finally, as [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus Cho]] theorizes, Bruce Banner subconsciously restrains the Hulk's maximum potential because he quantifies and calculates the external variables so that the Hulk could never hurt someone. Cho corroborates his thesis with a logical analysis of all the Hulk's historical conflicts.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 110}} However, if the suppression of Banner's restrictions occurs, the Hulk can neutralize this limitation, such as when he becomes the Worldbreaker.{{r|Incredible Hulks #634}} The Hulk has also performed impressive feats of strength in his career.[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Incredible Hulks Vol 1 622 0001.jpg|thumb|200px|Hulk demonstrating his massive leap.]]
**'''Superhuman Leaping:''' The Hulk is able to use his highly developed leg muscles to leap great distances. As the Hulk becomes enraged, his strength increases considerably, which means he can jump farther than usual. The Hulk has transposed about 1,000 miles with a single leap,{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 33}} and he jumped on top of the [[Mount Olympus]] from ground level.{{r|Hulk vs Hercules #1}}{{r|Incredible Hulks Vol 1 622}} On more than one occasion, the Hulk has nearly jumped into the Earth's orbit.{{r|Incredible Hulk #254}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #10}} The Hulk even managed to reach Mars' orbit with a single bound.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 24.NOW}} The Hulk also shows incredible precision with his ability to aim his jumps and landings. He grabbed missiles on multiple occasions and landed on islands barely visible from the height that he fell from.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 33}} While calm, the Hulk's leap has been measured to reach 473 mph.{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual Vol 1 #2000}}[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) and Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616) from Hulk Vol 2 24 0001.jpg|thumb|200px|Hulk easily overpowered Red Hulk with a single powerful clap.]]
**'''Superhuman Strength Utilizations:''' The Hulk can inhale great quantities of air for several effects. For example, he can expel the air at enormous speeds to knock down forests{{r|Incredible Hulk #273}} and armed troops.{{r|Incredible Hulk #5}} This resource also enables the Hulk to defeat several superhuman opponents, such as the [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]].{{r|Contest of Champions II #2}} The Hulk can slam his hands together to create a tremendously powerful sonic vibration that propagates through the air and has been compared to the strongest hurricane in history.{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #5}} This thunderclap has been powerful enough to disperse [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]]'s attacks,{{r|Incredible Hulk #113}} snuff out Johnny Storm's flame ability,{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 300}} and severely debilitate the [[Red Hulk (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]].{{r|Hulk Vol 2 24}} The Hulk can also hit the ground with his hands or legs to create violent tremors that thwart opponents{{r|Inhumans #12}} and destroy structures,{{r|Incredible Hulk #127}} being able to produce destructive shockwaves by stomping his foot.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 5}} He could also create shockwaves with enough power to shatter glass jars by simply snapping his fingers while possessed by the [[One Below All (Multiverse)|One Below All]].{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 8}}

{{Navigation
| title = Examples of the Hulk's Strength Demonstrations
| body  = The Hulk's feats are categorized according to their power output, ranging from below planetary level (Class D), planetary (Class C), multiplanetary (Class B), to at least solar system level (Class A). "Extreme rage" is equivalent to Class A, indicating that Bruce Banner was completely suppressed. This list is not exhaustive. The Hulk has a high proportion of high end feats compared to the total number of feats. Thus his peak is at least solar system level. Banner usually exerts a moderating influence on the Hulk, but these restrictions are neutralized in varying degrees when the Hulk is facing a more powerful and formidable opponent. Which is also a common feature of high-powered heroes who hold back.  
*The shockwaves from the Hulk's collision with Ironclad reached an infinite number of dimensions through the [[Crossroads (Dimension)|Crossroads]] nexus, creating cataclysmic upheavals and unimaginable destruction (Extreme rage, this feat diverges from the Hulk's average).{{r|Incredible Hulk #305}} Rupturing the space-time continuum with a powerful blow (Extreme rage, indicative of maximum known strength level).{{r|Incredible Hulk #135}} Applying force to the space-time structure in order to prevent the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] from being absorbed into a fissure (Class A. The Silver Surfer was helpless, despite being able to move in black holes without the board).{{r|Defenders #3}} Supporting and rising up despite being weighed down with a force equal to the weight of a star capable of going nova (Class B. With extreme effort. It has at very least about 460.000 times the mass of the Earth).{{r|Infinity #6}} Seriously injuring Arm'Cheddon, who withstood the Silver Surfer's energy blast at twice its maximum level (Extreme rage. The [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] can emit a destructive blast powerful enough to completely encompass an entire solar system).{{r|Incredible Hulks #632}} 
*Destroying a planet and a surrounding moon as a side-effect of a direct collision with the [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Red She-Hulk]] (Class B. The energy required to effectively destroy the nearby moon would destroy multiple planets).{{r|Incredible Hulks #634}} Disintegrating highly powerful beings such as the [[Bi-Beast (Earth-616)|Bi-Beast]], [[Arm'Cheddon (Earth-616)|Arm'Cheddon]], and an enhanced [[Fin Fang Foom (Earth-616)|Fin Fang Foom]] (Extreme rage. This was also an indirect consequence in consonance with the secondary effect described above).{{r|Incredible Hulks #634}} Overpowering and destroying the [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]]'s physical form (Extreme rage, indicative of maximum known strength level).{{r|Onslaught Marvel Universe #1}} Rupturing the space-time continuum again with a single punch (Extreme rage, indicative of maximum known strength level).{{r|Indestructible Hulk #15}} Shattering a glass wall tempered with [[Negative Zone]] particles, effectively traversing a space-time barrier obstructing his way (Class A. The Hulk also deflected adamantium bullets when heavily sedated).{{r|Hulk Vol 3 1}} 
*Pushing two spheres of matter and antimatter apart and throwing one into the outer space (Class C. It represented a threat to the very planet).{{r|Marvel Team-Up Annual #2}} Ripping apart an enormous device designed to fight against the [[Celestials (Race)|Celestials]] (Class A. Leveling down, it could plausibly be classified as a herald tier feat).{{r|Incredible Hulk #242}} Destroying an asteroid twice the size of [[Earth]] with a single punch (Class C. Self explanatory).{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #52}} Holding together the tectonic plates of a planet to keep it from collapsing (Class C. Self explanatory).{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 99}} Overpowering a field of energy endowed with sufficient power to alter the orbit of a planet (Class C. Self explanatory).{{r|Tales to Astonish #89}} Overpowering enhanced and gigantic incarnations of [[Bi-Beast (Earth-616)|Bi-Beast]] and [[Luc Lemay (Earth-616)|Wendigo]] (Class A. Both are regular foes of the Savage Hulk and were vastly enhanced).{{r|Incredible Hulks #631}} Overpowering a group of Avengers, including the [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]], [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Thor (Jane Foster)]] and [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] (Class A. The heroes, which included Rogue after assimilating a large fraction of the Hulk's power, are established top tier characters, with the exception of Wonder Man).{{r|Avengers #686}}
*Overpowering a group of several heroes, including [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Thor (Jane Foster)]] and the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] (Class A. Thor (Jane Foster) is an established top tier character).{{r|Secret Empire #6}} Overpowering the combined efforts of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], including a significantly weakened Juggernaut and [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], and breaking both arms of Colossus with ease in the process (Class B. This group consisted of a few planetary threats, since Juggernaut was weakened).{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #2}} Overpowering the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] before an outside interference changed the course of the battle (Likely Class A. The full extent of power that was at disposal to the Juggernaut has yet to be revealed. However, it is presumably equal to the power exerted by his classic incarnation).{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 2}} Overpowering Colossus in another encounter (Class C. Colossus scales with the Thing, who is a regular rival of a suppressed Savage Hulk, although inferior).{{r|X-Men vs. Hulk #1}} Lifting a "chunk" of [[Las Vegas]] and landing it perfectly on the ground with ease (Class D. Self explanatory).{{r|Incredible Hulks #631}} 
*Tearing Dracula's [[Adamantium]] netting with ease (Class C. Presumably Secondary Adamantium, which is far weaker than Primary Adamantium).{{r|Fear Itself: Hulk vs. Dracula #1}} Ploughing through [[Simon Utrecht (Earth-616)|Vector]]'s telekinetic repulsion while he was repelling reality itself (Class A. Vector is an occasional foe of the Hulk, and rivals an enraged Hulk).{{r|Incredible Hulk #305}} Almost breaking the East Coast and threatening to break the planet by the emission of energy from his body (Class C. The planet would certainly be destroyed if the Hulk did not have restrained himself).{{r|World War Hulk #5}} Bending Silver Surfer's board after hitting the opponent with it (Class A. Norrin's board is as invulnerable as the Silver Surfer himself).{{r|Defenders: The Best Defense #1}} Driving [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s claws back into his own skull, and therefore damaging Adamantium with Adamantium (Class A. This feat is regarded as impossible through conventional means).{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 12}} Overpowering a power-draining mechanism which contained much of the combined power of the Hulk himself, the [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] and the [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]], and no other Defender could break out of (Class A. Hulk and the Defenders were drained of their power, but the Hulk's rage increased exponentially in order to save them).{{r|Defenders Vol 2 8}} 
*Denting the [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]]'s Primary Adamantium shell (Class A. Primary Adamantium is regarded as virtually indestructible).{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #12}} Smashing through Adamantium itself (Class C. Secondary Adamantium).{{r|Incredible Hulk #228}} Crunching and twisting an Adamantium alloy around [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]], imprisoning and leaving him unable to break out, and throwing the sphere from New York to the mid-Atlantic (Class C. Secondary Adamantium).{{r|Marvel Team-Up #18}} Snapping Adamantium netting (Class C. Secondary Adamantium).{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 11}} Shattering the [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K]]'s Adamantium and steel alloy armor by just flexing his muscles (Class C. Secondary Adamantium).{{r|Incredible Hulk #167}} Briefly knocking down [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] with a sequence of powerful blows (Class A. The required power output to knock Thanos down should be at least on this scale).{{r|Infinity Gauntlet #4}} Destroying the [[Crypto-Man (Earth-616)|Crypto-Man]] after he was boosted with physical strength superior to that of Thor (Class A. Thor's striking power and brute strength are on this level).{{r|Incredible Hulk # 205}} 
*Destroying the [[Hammer of Nul]] (Class A. The Hulk was mystically enhanced).{{r|Fear Itself: Hulk vs. Dracula #3}} Breaking off solidified [[Adhesive X]] from his entire body with no leverage (Possible Class A. This had never been done with physical force, before or after).{{r|Captain America #257}} Performing a thunderclap that destroyed [[Dark-Crawler (Earth-616)|Dark Crawler]]'s pocket-universe (Class A. Pocket universes, while comparatively small, are still immense in size).{{r|Incredible Hulk #126}} Shrugging off the combined efforts of Namor and Silver Surfer to restrain him (Class A. Silver Surfer is a herald tier character, and was not considerably restricting his power in this context).{{r|Sub-Mariner #35}} Holding a 150 billion ton mountain which was dropped on them by the [[Owen Reece (Earth-616)|Molecule Man]] when no other hero could even react (Class D. Self explanatory).{{r|Secret Wars #4}} Hurting [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] numerous times.{{r|Hulk: Let the Battle Begin #1}}{{r|Thor #385}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #2001}}{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 7}} (Class A. Including fracturing his skull. Thor has incredible feats of durability, such as withstanding multiple blows from foes as powerful as the Silver Surfer). 
*Injuring [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] with three punches (Class A. Hercules' durability is on this scale).{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 107}} Overpowering a weakened Hercules (Class C. Hercules was much inferior than his classic incarnation).{{r|Incredible Hulk: Hercules Unleashed Vol 1 1}} Pushing a ten times stronger than normal warrior's madness Thor towards the ground with a single arm (Class A. Hulk was comparable to this Thor, who is ten times tougher in this state).{{r|Incredible Hulk #440}} Reflecting [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]]'s ocular beams back into his eyes, knocking him unconscious (Class A. The raw power required to engage the Gladiator in battle and overpower his ocular beams should be on this scale. Before entering the factory).{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual Vol 1 1997}} Stopping a strike from [[Roger Norvell (Earth-616)|Red Norvell]]'s [[Crusher (Hammer)|equal copy of Mjolnir]] in midair with only one hand (Class A. Red Norvell is practically equivalent to Thor in raw power).{{r|Incredible Hulk #422}} While the Hulk was holding back, he fought against [[w:c:DC:Kal-El (New Earth)|Superman]] and pushed him to his limits (Class A. Superman is one of the most iconic and powerful top tiers of the DC comics).{{r|Marvel Versus DC Vol 1 3}} 
*Matching the full power of the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]], and defeating the latter (Class A. Sentry stated outright that he was not holding back. Sentry is easily on this scale of power).{{r|World War Hulk #5}} Bringing the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] to his knees with two blows (Class A. The Juggernaut has incredible durability and a personal force field. Cain is a herald tier character).{{r|Incredible Hulk #404}} Shattering the crimson bands of [[Cyttorak (Earth-616)|Cyttorak]] (Possible Class A. It's raw power is inconsistent).{{r|Incredible Hulk #450}} Easily defeating the [[Hulkbuster]] Iron Man (Class A. The Hulkbuster is powerful enough to engage Hulk in battle).{{r|Iron Man #305}}{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1}}{{r|Original Sin Vol 1 3.4}} Matching the [[Super-Adaptoid (Earth-616)|Super-Adaptoid]], who had acquired raw power from one hundred heroes like Iron Man and Vision (Likely Class B. Iron Man constantly faces the Hulk, but he is inferior to the herald tiers. It is plausible that one hundred characters combined reach this power level).{{r|Incredible Hulk #469}} Matching [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax the Destroyer]] (Class A. This incarnation of Drax is a top tier foe, and his vast power was further magnified since he was in possession of the [[Power Stone|Power Gem]]).{{r|Warlock and the Infinity Watch #13}} 
*While holding back, without accessing the Worldbreaker mode, Hulk sent [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus]] flying with one powerful hit (Class A. Zeus is a powerful skyfather, and only herald tier characters can knock him down while enhanced and amplified by energy).{{r|Incredible Hulks Vol 1 622}} Destroying the latest Hulkbuster Armor, throwing [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] miles away with a single punch, and overloading [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]]'s [[Vibranium]] [[Panther Habit]], which was believed to be impossible (Class A. She-Hulk was enhanced above normal levels, the Hulkbuster is herald tier level, and the Panther Habit is extremely durable).{{r|Immortal Hulk #7}} Knocking the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] out with only three punches (Possible Class B. They were both weakened by the passage through the portal).{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 95}} Matching two [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] teams during a prolonged period of time in spite of becoming increasingly weaker due to the physical separation from Bruce Banner. (Extreme rage. The group consisted of highly powerful individuals such as [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], the only top tier, the [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], the Iron Man, [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]], [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor McKenzie]], and the [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]]).{{r|{{cl|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 321}}-[[Incredible Hulk Vol 1 322|322]]}} 
*Overpowering [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]], the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] and [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] (Class C. None of them were above planetary level){{r|Fantastic Four #25}} and afterwards matching the combined forces of the Avengers and the Fantastic Four (Class A. Thor was among them).{{r|Fantastic Four #26}}.  Matching the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], prior to [[House of M (Event)|House of M]], and [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]], [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], and the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], while the narration establishes that Hulk's power is greater than their combined might (Class B. Iron Man on a regular basis faces some incarnations of the Hulk, but he is inferior to top tiers. Wonder Man was always recognized as near the power level of a suppressed Thor, and Wanda was not manifesting her full potential).{{r|Hulk Vol 1 7}} When the Thing's physical strength was almost doubled, the Hulk still had the upper hand (Class C. The Thing is roughly the same power level of the Gray Hulk incarnation, who is a planet buster).{{r|Marvel Feature #11}} 
*Closing the doors to a nuclear reactor core that Thor and the Thing together could not budge (Class A. Thor is extremely powerful, and hence this feat is classified on this scale).{{r|Iron Man Vol 2 6}} Overpowering the combined efforts of the [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]], [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], and [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] to pin him down despite becoming gradually weakened due to the physical separation from Banner (Class A. Hercules is a herald tier character).{{r|Incredible Hulk #316}} Equaling a wet and all-out Namor in battle during a brief period of time (Class C. Namor, while in his native element, is recurrently portrayed as near the Hulk's, Hercules' and Thor's suppressed power level).{{r|Hulk Vol 2 10}} Overcoming his own strength, which was redirected against him (Class A. Self explanatory).{{r|Incredible Hulk #114}} Stopping the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]]'s charge and crumpling his helmet (Class A. The Hulk's power was amplified by Celestial technology).{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #3}} Ripping through a bunker designed to withstand the explosion of many thousands of megatons in magnitude (Class D. Self explanatory).{{r|Incredible Hulk #177}} 
*Breaking through heavy duty blast doors capable of withstanding a nuclear strike with a punch (Class D. Self explanatory).{{r|Incredible Hulk #140}} Punching away and knocking out the immovable [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]], and punching the [[Gunther Bain (Earth-616)|Unus the Untouchable]]'s force field with such force that the force field hit Unus himself and knocked him out (Class C. These characters were powerful, but bellow the top tiers).{{r|Marvel Fanfare #7}} Picking up and throwing the immense dragon [[Fin Fang Foom (Earth-616)|Fin Fang Foom]] directly to the moon (Class D. This was a reasonable feat given Foom's considerable size).{{r|Hulk vs. Fin Fang Foom #1}} Throwing the [[Soul Stone|Soul Gem]] through the interior layers of planet [[K'ai]], into its core (Class D. This was less impressive and should be around this level).{{r|Incredible Hulk #248}} Easily damaging and almost destroying the Iron Man's armor (Class C. Iron Man sometimes faces the top tiers on equal grounds and even subjugates them, but is significantly inferior overall).{{r|Incredible Hulk #321}}
*Thor has admitted that Hulk could be stronger than himself,{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #2001}} that compared to himself there appears to be no limit to the Hulk's vast strength,{{r|Thor #385}} and that he never could beat the Hulk.{{r|Fear Itself #5}} The mad titan [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] compared the Hulk's ever increasing strength to that of the former Champion of the Universe, [[Tryco Slatterus (Earth-616)|Tryco Slatterus]], when he was wielding the [[Power Stone|Power Gem]], and said that he had avoided a confrontation with the Hulk in the past because of this.{{r|Thanos Quest #1}}
}}

*'''Superhuman Stamina:''' The Hulk's body counteracts fatigue poisons that build up in his muscles during physical activity. In fact, the Hulk was capable to leap endlessly during an entire day without showing any signs of fatigue.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 25}} In an enraged state, the Hulk is capable of exerting himself at peak physical capacity for several weeks before fatigue begins to really affect him.{{r|Incredible Hulk #275}} However, just like his vast physical strength, the Hulk's stamina does increase as he becomes angrier.{{r|Incredible Hulk #112}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #340}} In an enraged state, the Hulk was able to successfully stalemate the warrior's madness Thor,{{r|Incredible Hulk #440}} a state which temporarily enhances Thor's strength and stamina to 10 times that of his normal state in exchange for adversely affecting his intelligence.{{r|Thor #502}} A giant robotic Sentinel has calculated the Hulk's stamina as almost unlimited.{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #7}} The Hulk, while in his Nul persona, also fought Thor until Thor collapsed exhausted on the ground.{{r|Fear Itself #5}} 
[[File:Incredible Hulks Vol 1 615 Textless.jpg|thumb]]

*'''Dynamic Durability:''' In addition to immense strength, the Hulk's body possesses a high degree of resistance to physical injury. The Hulk has survived tremendous amount of punishment throughout his career. The Hulk's skin is impervious to conventional blades, [[Adamantium]] and [[Vibranium]] being strictly the few known metals that can effectively pierce and penetrate his skin. The Hulk was even able to remove [[Adhesive X]] from his body without any injury.{{r|Captain America #257}} This invulnerability extends to the optic system since bullets,{{r|Incredible Hulk #395}} grenade shrapnel,{{r|Incredible Hulk #373}} [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]]'s arrows,{{r|Avengers Vol 3 75}} and even the Valkyrie's enchanted blade [[Dragonfang]]{{r|Incredible Hulk #207}} did not penetrate nor damage it. The Hulk is capable of withstanding high caliber bullets, powerful energy blasts, pressures extremes, falls from orbital heights,{{r|Defenders #34}}{{r|Marvel Team-Up #54}}{{r|Fear Itself #5}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #254}} maximized heat without blistering, maximized cold without freezing, and also massive impacts. The Hulk has withstood several times the impact of ground zero nuclear explosions,{{r|Incredible Hulk #121}}{{r|Fantastic Four #533}}{{r|Tales to Astonish #62}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #144}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #174}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #440|444}} the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]]'s Nova Blast,{{r|World War Hulk #2}}{{r|Fantastic Four #534}}{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 17}} with a maximum temperature of one million degrees Fahrenheit, and also the crushing pressures of 100Gs{{r|Tales to Astonish #73}} without suffering damage or harm. In fact, when the Maestro's Dog O' War, a robot claimed to be able to crush Adamantium in its jaws in 7.3 seconds, had Hulk's exposed neck in its jaws, it was unable to even lacerate his skin before being ripped apart.{{r|Hulk: Future Imperfect #1}} In another monumental example of his durability, the Hulk even withstood being subjected to a mechanism capable to easily soften and manipulate Adamantium.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #1}} The Hulk was also able to withstand a planet-devastating impact,{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 105}} a planet-shattering impact at point blank range,{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #52}} the [[Galaxy Master]]'s planet-destroying strongest attacks,{{r|Incredible Hulk #112}} a colossal blow from a [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]]'s empowered Cyclops,{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #12}} and a mighty blast from a somewhat hungry [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]].{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #9}} The Hulk even withstood magical energy calculated as over 100 times more powerful than [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]]' strongest blows.{{r|Incredible Hulks #629}} The Hulk also withstood a few of the incredibly powerful blows from [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus]] when relatively calm.{{r|Incredible Hulks Vol 1 622}} The full force of the [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]'s optic blasts, estimated by himself to be powerful enough to rip a small planet in half,{{r|Cyclops #1}} only caused minor damage.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #2}} The Hulk has also withstood multiple blows from beings such as [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]{{r|Thor #385}}{{r|Thor #489}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #440}} and the [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Abomination]]{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 #25}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 #54}}{{r|Incredible Hulks #618|619}} on a regular basis. The Hulk's durability, much like his physical strength, is fueled by rushes of adrenaline while angry.{{r|Incredible Hulk #340}} This was also exemplified when [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] stated during [[World War Hulk]] that the Hulk's skin was harder to damage,{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #2}} when the Hulk withstood a two times more powerful blast from the [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] than a blast that had previously damaged him,{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 4 2}} and when during a battle against [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] he stated that the harder he hits the Hulk, the less it seems to hurt him.{{r|X-Men vs. Hulk #1}} This was further exemplified when Wolverine's{{r|Wolverine: Origins #28}} and [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]]'s{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 15}} claws failed to hurt the Hulk.
[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Incredible Hulk Vol 1 398 0001.jpg|thumb|Hulk regains his mass and heals within seconds.]]
*'''Self-Regeneration Manipulation:''' As a Gamma Mutate with a connection to the [[Below-Place]], Bruce Banner/Hulk learned he possessed an autonoetic commandeering of his own recovery rate and extremital prehensility of his individual biomass, as had others in the past.{{r|Immortal Hulk: Time of Monsters #1}} Once having been pulled apart and put in a collective of several different jars only to compel his body to come back together by sheer force of will.{{r|Immortal Hulk #8}}
**'''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Despite the Hulk's high resistance to physical harm, it is possible to cause the Hulk injury. However, the Hulk is capable of regenerating damaged or destroyed areas of his entire body with much greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human. In fact, the Hulk was able to systematically regenerate his internal organs and tissues in an alternate reality.{{r|Incredible Hulk: The End #1}} He was also able to literally rip off a large fraction of his head allowing it to completely regrow.{{r|Incredible Hulk #446}} In a notorious episode, the Maestro persona molecularly rebuilt his body after being atomized.{{r|Incredible Hulk #460}} The Hulk also demonstrated his exceptional healing capacity when, during a battle with [[Simon Utrecht (Earth-616)|Vector]], all of his skin and most of his muscle mass were extracted from his body. The Hulk regained his mass and healed within only seconds.{{r|Incredible Hulk #398}} Even the Omega-Level biokinetic [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]]'s death touch could only retard him temporarily.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #1}} Most extreme depictions of his healing factor also include reintegrating members isolated from his body.{{r|Immortal Hulk #8}} The Hulk's regenerative healing factor also enables him to resist to physical transmutations.{{r|Incredible Hulk #262}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #363}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #266}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #5}}{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #2}} Additionally, the Hulk heals faster and more extensively the madder he gets.{{r|Incredible Hulk #340}} For example, [[Carmilla Black (Earth-616)|Scorpion (Carmilla Black)]] once injected into Hulk's body a chemical substance that counteracts his healing factor. [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus Cho]] then caused the Hulk to get enraged enough for his immune system to repel the substance.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 110}} Combined with the Hulk's superhuman durability, it makes him exceedingly difficult to defeat or incapacitate, as noted by Wolverine during their second battle.{{r|Incredible Hulk #340}}
***'''Disease Immunity:''' The Hulk is completely invulnerable to all known Earth-based diseases and viruses, including AIDS.{{r|Incredible Hulk #388}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #14}} He can operate under intense conditions for prolonged periods of time due to his body not developing fatigue toxins quickly.
***'''Decelerated Aging:''' For all intents and purposes; the Hulk lives indefinitely. Because of an enhanced healing factor, derived from the properties of gamma energy that empowers him, the Hulk has a prolonged lifespan. A possible future persona, the Maestro, was in his physical prime despite being over one hundred years old.{{r|Hulk: Future Imperfect #1}} In another alternate future it is implied that the Hulk's body effectively lasts forever,{{r|Incredible Hulk: The End #1}} further proven when both that worlds [[Bruce Banner (Earth-TRN781)|Bruce Banner]] and [[Craig Hollis (Earth-TRN781)|Mister Immortal]] were seen as the only two left alive to witness the end of the universe.{{r|Immortal Hulk #20}}
**'''Body Part Autonomy:''' In spite of his nervous system being badly dissociated, Banner/Hulk can willingly control each of his individual body parts as if they were still part of his uniformly whole physiology.{{r|Immortal Hulk #8}} Being able to operate his appendages and command his internal organs to move and act according to his will if he so chooses.
[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Indestructible Hulk Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Hulk running at incredible speed.]]
*'''Superhuman Speed:''' Regardless of his size, Hulk's superhumanly strong legs allow him to run at speeds that are well beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete. In fact, the Hulk's speed is so relatively high that, while tunneling underground from [[Subterranea]] to California, the Avengers feared that the Hulk could fracture the San Andreas fault line in a matter of few hours.{{r|Incredible Hulk #128}} In an excellent display of increased velocity, the Hulk easily outperformed an aircraft while on land.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #11}} Hulk's astronomical speed extends to his jumps, what allowed him to pursue and reach a space missile.{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #10}} The Hulk also possesses immense swimming speeds as well. He has been clocked to be swimming at 80 knots,{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 33}} and has even matched [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]]'s underwater speed,{{r|Incredible Hulk #118}} even while Namor was moving quickly enough to create a whirlpool,{{r|Tales to Astonish #100}} much to the Atlantean king's surprise. Referring to the Hulk's formidable speed, Banner pondered that the Hulk is able to run at eye-blurring speeds and swim fast enough to build propulsion.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #14}} The Hulk has been fast enough to several times capture or intercept mortar shells and missiles shot at him.{{r|Fantastic Four #26}}{{r|Savage Hulk Vol 2 #1}}{{r|Giant-Size Defenders #2}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #208}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #245}} The Hulk has also eventually been recognized to be extremely agile proportionally to his size.{{r|Fantastic Four #12}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #144}}{{r|Tales to Astonish #76}}{{r|Fantastic Four #25}}{{r|Comet Man #3}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #316}} In fact, his spectacular reflexes have even been described as "lightning-fast reflexes".{{r|Incredible Hulk #276}}{{r|Marvel Feature #3}} More examples of the Hulk's prodigious combat speed include easily catching the [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]'s shield throw,{{r|Avengers Vol 3 75}}{{r|Avengers: Season One #1}} catching an arrow fired by [[Clint Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]],{{r|Hulk Smash Avengers Vol 1 4}} hit [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] while he was running at high speeds,{{r|Incredible Hulk #175}}{{r|The Order Vol 1 3}} pursuing and touching the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] while the Surfer was maneuvering at supersonic speeds,{{r|Tales to Astonish #92}} while holding back tremendously against physically inferior opponents, he's hit both the [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] despite his heightened senses and extraordinary reaction time{{r|Daredevil #163}} and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] despite Peter's remarkable reflexes,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #120}}{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 #14}}{{r|Marvel Team-Up #27}} easily dodge bullets and missiles shot from a short distance away,{{r|Incredible Hulk #4}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #132}}{{r|Iron Man #131}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Special #2}} effortlessly capture a bullet in his teeth in mid-transformation,{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 43}} and also regularly match beings with virtually unparalleled combat speed such as [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]],{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual Vol 1 1997}} [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]],{{r|World War Hulk #5}} and the Silver Surfer.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 125}} The Hulk has also hit several speedsters, who were operating in an accelerated time flow, before they could even react.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #12}}

*'''Reactive Adaptation:''' There were several events in the past where the Hulk not only faced extended periods of time in oxygen-deprived outer space without suffocating, but he also frequently spoke in these inhospitable habitats. It was theorized by an [[Life-Model Decoy|LMD]] of [[Nicholas Fury (LMD) (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] that the Hulk could adapt to the environment of space as an inherent property of his mutation. He based this thesis on accumulated data about the Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 90}} For example, Hulk can harmonize his biological structure with the depths of the ocean.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 9}} Fury's hypothesis has been confirmed, since it was stated that the Hulk can adapt to any environment, even airless space.{{r|Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide Vol 1 1}} Therefore this evidences that the Hulk could adapt to a wide diversity of hostile habitats. It is plausible that this ability is enhanced and amplified by the Hulk's rage. Accordingly, it has also been stated that the Hulk does not always need to breathe.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 1}}
**'''Underwater Breathing:''' The Hulk has been on the ocean floor a number of times. The Hulk is able to breathe due to his body developing a gland which creates an oxygenated perfluorocarbon emulsion which fills his lungs and equalizes the pressure.{{r|Incredible Hulk #138}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #145}} He is therefore able to breathe fluid and avoid decompression and nitrogen narcosis.
*'''Telepathic Resistance:''' In many instances the Hulk has demonstrated great psychic resistance as a side-effect of his innate rage and the multiple personalities inside his mind.{{r|Incredible Hulk #203}}{{r|Tales to Astonish #89}}{{r|Defenders #12}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #259}}{{r|Cable #34}}{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #1}} When in ideal conditions it is extremely difficult to enslave the Hulk mentally. In parallel, this ability increases with his rage. This was demonstrated when Psyklop managed to enthrall the Hulk initially with his hypnotizing power, but was not able to subjugate an enraged Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk #203}} In an example of his mental prowess, the Hulk was even able to survive using the [[Ultimate Machine]], which contained the collective knowledge of an entire universe. While the Leader died, despite his heightened intellect, due to being unable to process the entirety of the information and having his brain overloaded, the Hulk was able to survive using it and find out that Rick Jones was in danger, after which he removed the device and leapt away.{{r|Tales to Astonish #74|75}} In an astounding exhibition of his telepathic immunity, the Hulk proved to be unaffected by the [[Xemnu (Earth-616)|Xemnu]]'s telepathic assault,{{r|Hulk Vol 2 #30}} which has been powerful enough to mesmerize the entire human population,{{r|Monsters on the Prowl #11}} put a mental block on Doctor Strange to prevent him from using his powers,{{r|Defenders #12}} or even engage the enormously powerful [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]] in battle.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest #1}} The Hulk was also the only one able to remember the Sentry after Sentry had used his psionic powers to remove his memories from everyone on the planet. When highly powerful psychics, such as Professor X, could only utilize his psionic powers to find out that their memories had been radically altered and twisted.{{r|Sentry #5}} The Hulk has withstood telepathic attacks from the powerful [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]],{{r|Tales to Astonish #89}} the [[Shaper of Worlds (Earth-616)|Shaper of Worlds]],{{r|Incredible Hulk #155}} [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]],{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #1}} [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]],{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #78}} [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]],{{r|World War Hulk #3}} the [[Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)|Leader]],{{r|Incredible Hulk #123}} [[Marvin Flumm (Earth-616)|Mentallo]],{{r|Incredible Hulk #403}} the [[Maynard Tiboldt (Earth-616)|Ringmaster]],{{r|Incredible Hulk #217}} etc.
*'''Extrasensory Perception:'''
**'''Astral Form Perception:''' The Hulk has the unique ability of being able to see "astral forms," or ghosts,{{r|Incredible Hulk #369}} and even physically interact with them.{{r|Incredible Hulk #371}} This power has come in handy when working with his fellow Defender, Doctor Strange, who is able to leave his body in an usually invisible, ghost-like state better known as an astral form. Bruce Banner subconsciously feared his father's ghost would come back to haunt him, and so the Hulk developed this mechanism to allow him to look out for him. More recent events have shown that the power to see astral forms may now extend to Bruce Banner. However, it was suggested the clarity of the astral forms is diminished when compared to the Hulk's ability to view them. The Hulk's ability to see astral forms may go beyond just seeing individual spirits. The Hulk once experienced a whole town in the middle of the desert that then faded away into nothing. While it is possible it was merely a mirage, it is possible the Hulk was able to see a town that did not exist in our plane of reality that no one else could see.
**'''Homing Ability:''' The Hulk also has a seemingly mystical homing ability that enables him to locate the area in New Mexico where Banner first became the Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk #314}} This applies even if the Hulk is in another dimension. An image of the Maestro once explained to Bruce that the reason he was able to do that was because the Maestro's spirit was there, calling to him.{{r|Incredible Hulk #460}} However, since the time Maestro was resurrected, the Hulk has continued to return to the gamma bomb site, suggesting that there is more to his ability than merely the Maestro's spirit. This homing ability has also been used to find people on rare occasions. For example, the Hulk was able to dig a tunnel underground exactly in the direction of Onslaught.{{r|Incredible Hulk #445}} While it is possible that Onslaught was mentally leading the Hulk to him, there were other instances of the Hulk demonstrating this ability. The Hulk's instincts led him to Rick Jones{{r|Incredible Hulk #268}} and Betty,{{r|Incredible Hulk #170}} and the Hulk located the Abomination with no prior knowledge of his whereabouts.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 25}} The Hulk was also able to know that the Vision was approaching while inside an underground tunnel, even though he could neither hear nor see the intangible Avenger's approach.{{r|Incredible Hulk #128}}
*'''Gamma Radiation/Energy Manipulation and Emission:''' Not usually a power associated with the Hulk, but there is enough evidence that Hulk possesses at least a limited ability to manipulate forms of energy, particularly gamma radiation. The Hulk's body works like a "gamma battery" by constantly creating and radiating gamma energy.{{r|Incredible Hulk #103}} The Troyjan emperor [[Arm'Cheddon (Earth-616)|Armageddon]] once wanted to employ the Hulk's own gamma radiation to power machines to revive his dead son again. However, the Hulk outsmarted him by consciously force feeding his energy into these machines at a rate too fast for them to handle, and they promptly overloaded and exploded.{{r|Incredible Hulk #464}} The Hulk also generated massive amounts of gamma radiation during World War Hulk,{{r|World War Hulk #5}} and produced considerable quantity while in the [[Dark Dimension]].{{r|Incredible Hulks #634}} The Hulk has also shown the ability to redirect gamma rays unleashed towards him. When the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] used the Gammatron Bombarder device on him, the Hulk deflected the blast at the device and destroyed it.{{r|Incredible Hulk #128}} During the battle against the [[Galaxy Master (Earth-616)|Galaxy Master]], Hulk resisted and reflected the enemy's "gamma bombardment" attacks, and further demonstrated a beam-shaped projection of gamma energy by using the accumulated gamma energy within himself against the entity.{{r|Incredible Hulk #270}} The Hulk is also able to absorb gamma energy. As Bruce Banner, he absorbed the tremendous amount of energy stored aboard the Intelligencia's Helicarrier.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 610}} As the Hulk, he has demonstrated the ability to absorb gamma radiation as he drained the second [[Robert Maverick (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 685}} [[Walter Langkowski (Earth-616)|Sasquatch]]{{r|Immortal Hulk #5}} and [[Rebecca Green (Earth-616)|Rebecca Green]]{{r|Immortal Hulk: The Threshing Place Vol 1 1}} of their gamma energy. The Hulk even managed to absorb the gamma radiation of several nuclear bombs, which made him grow to a huge size, to the point where he became much larger than [[Fin Fang Foom (Earth-616)|Fin Fang Foom]].{{r|Incredible Hulks Vol 1 635}} The exact extent to which the Hulk controls his own gamma radiation, and also extrinsic sources of gamma radiation, has yet to be established. 

{{Navigation
| title = Former Powers
| body  = **'''Retroactive Immortality:''' For all intents and purposes the Hulk cannot permanently die. The exact nature of this ability is unknown; however, it is suggested that, every time the Hulk or Banner is killed since the day that Bruce was hit with the [[Gamma Bomb]], the [[Green Door]] is opened and allows him to "walk through" in order to successfully enable self-resurrection. It is suggested that it is his other self who walks through, as Banner would rather be at peace than be revived as the Hulk. It is also suggested that damaging the hypothalamus, an area in the forebrain which controls the nervous system as well as emotions, can effectively kill the Hulk, but the attempts to perform this action have been interrupted by outside interference from those preferring to use the Hulk for their nefarious purposes.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684}} Following his resurrection by the Challenger,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 679}} if Banner should die, he would self-resurrect by transforming into the Hulk at nightfall.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 1}} This power was apparently lost after the Leader was separated from the One Below All which effectively shut down the Green Door.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 50}}

| Abilities               = [[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Incredible Hulk Vol 1 312 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Bruce as an infant, starts inventing a new project with his super-genius mind.]]
'''Super-Genius Intelligence:''' Doctor Bruce Banner is a super-genius in nuclear physics,{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia Vol 1 The Incredible Hulk}} possessing a mind so brilliant that it cannot be measured by any known intelligence test.{{r|Incredible Hulk #312}} Hence he is capable of extraordinary feats of intellect, such as to successfully reconfigure an advanced and especially sophisticated computer system (intended to be used to rule the world){{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 2}} in a matter of seconds.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 5}} In effect, Banner even accomplished to infect a computer system with a virus which even Tony Stark, employing his skills, was unable to counteract.{{r|A + X Vol 1 7}} Banner is regarded by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] as the most brilliant nuclear scientist (presumably on the planet),{{r|Incredible Hulk #153}} and another description corroborates Tony's statement upon indicating that Banner is the greatest nuclear scientist in the world.{{r|Incredible Hulk #117}} Banner also has expertise in several additional fields, such as engineering,{{r|Giant-Size Super-Stars #1}} architecture,{{r|Incredible Hulk #285}} and biology.{{r|Incredible Hulk #468}} Banner was referred as the only true expert on radiation-based mutation.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #2}} He was once estimated as the fourth smartest person on the planet,{{r|Dark Reign: The List - Hulk #1}} and even [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] recognizes him as one of the most intelligent person on Earth.{{r|Incredible Hulk #605}}

'''Master Combatant:''' The Hulk is a skillful and capable warrior, demonstrating vast versatility and intuition in the battle, like anticipating and exploiting the weakness of [[Hyperion]].{{r|Giant-Size Defenders #4}} The Hulk has consistently faced warriors with experience in combat, such as [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]],{{r|Defenders #10}}{{r|Hulk: Let the Battle Begin #1}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #440}} the [[Skurge (Earth-616)|Executioner]],{{r|Tales to Astonish #77}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #102}} and [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]].{{r|Tales to Astonish #79}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #316|322}}{{r|Hulk vs Hercules #1}} As the Green Scar, he has had training in multiple combat arms, including [[glossary:B#Broadsword|broadswords]], [[glossary:S#Spears|spears]], and battle shields.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 94}} As Doc Green, he received martial arts training from the expert martial artist [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Daniel Rand]].{{r|Hulk Vol 3 12}} 

'''Self-Restraint:''' When Banner is the Hulk he can influence the Hulk's behavior to a limited extent. However, several facts indicate that Banner subconsciously restrains the Hulk.{{r|Onslaught Marvel Universe #1}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 110}}{{r|Incredible Hulks #634}}{{r|Hulk vs Hercules #1}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 54}} For example, the Hulk asked for [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] to psionically shut Bruce Banner off so that the Hulk's sheer power could be unleashed against the threat of [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]]. In another occasion, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] has also deduced that Bruce Banner exerts a moderating influence on the Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk #316}} [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Doctor Samson]] even pondered that, while extensive destruction was caused by the Hulk, he never killed a single soul confronting the army.{{r|Hulk: Gray #3}} The Immortal Hulk recognized that Amadeus Cho's hypothesis about Banner exercising subconscious control on the Hulk is plausible, though it works only for the other classic incarnations of the Green Goliath.{{r|Immortal Hulk #20}} Upon being subjected to the [[Nightmare (Earth-616)|Nightmare]]'s machinations, the Hulk also aroused his uncontrollable inner savagery, revealing that Banner had lost ascendancy over the Hulk, which ultimately resulted in Banner's psychic suicide.{{r|Incredible Hulk #299}} In yet another instance, the [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]], before an imminent confrontation between the Hulk and the X-Men, scanned the Hulk's mind and discovered that Banner was in control and the Hulk posed no threat, which was soon confirmed by the team.{{r|Savage Hulk Vol 2 4}}

'''[[Multilingual]]:''' Banner learned Russian while getting his Ph.D.{{r|Incredible Hulk #259}} He also speaks Austro-Bavarian.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 5}}

| Strength                = Class 100+, although this strength chart is strictly made for comparison purposes among characters, and so it is not a literal description. The Incredible Hulk is one of the physically strongest beings in the Marvel Universe, and also the strongest mortal to ever walk the planet Earth.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20100111010836/http://www.brokenfrontier.com/columns/p/detail/hulk-skaar-hercules Greg Pak statements]</ref> The cosmic wanderer [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] regards the Hulk as the strongest living mortal he had ever encountered.{{r|Tales to Astonish #93}} In human form Banner possesses the normal human strength of a man of his age, height, and build who engages in no regular exercise. When the Hulk gets enraged his physical strength increases exponentially. The Hulk has no strength limit as his strength varies up to literally unlimited levels, according to the extremely powerful cosmic entity [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]].{{r|Secret Wars II #8}} Most currently, [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]]'s mathematical computations also inferred that the Hulk's strength is indeed incalculable.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #1}} The powerful entity [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]] further postulated that the Hulk's strength, for all practical purposes, is limitless.{{r|Tales to Astonish #89}} In fact, [[Jack Kirby]], who designed and created the character, referenced the Hulk's strength as being unlimited.<ref>[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=zeeDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=%22The+Hulk%27s+strength+is+unlimited%22&source=bl&ots=TVYtFJ8Ku9&sig=ACfU3U315bI3XXWpjGV5cczbD6RNC7p3Gw&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiulfL9-fTrAhVtposKHZlGC2gQ6AEwGHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Hulk's%20strength%20is%20unlimited%22&f=false Jack Kirby statements]</ref> Additionally, as the foundation of his phenomenal strength, his rage is also described as being limitless.{{r|Incredible Hulk #316}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #15}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #198}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #225}}
| Weaknesses              = '''Gamma Radiation Draining:''' The Hulk is sometimes portrayed as vulnerable to gamma radiation draining by sufficiently powerful energy manipulators.{{r|Incredible Hulk #250}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #391}} Reverting to human form may be necessary for the Hulk to recharge his gamma energy.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 53}} However, the Hulk is eventually characterized as possessing high degree of immunity to this weakness.<ref>As seen in [[Planet Hulk]] and [[World War Hulk]].</ref> For example, the mutant [[Armando MuÃ±oz (Earth-616)|Darwin]] was unable to drain his gamma radiation, and Hulk deliberately transferred his energy into an entire race of absorbing entities without collapsing. Even previous to these events the Hulk has displayed this potential. For example, the hero [[Rom (Earth-616)|Rom]] was unable to cure Banner from his condition,{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 296}} and the Hulk intentionally overloaded the Armageddon absorption mechanism.{{r|Incredible Hulk #464}}

[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) and James Darnell (Earth-616) from Immortal Hulk Vol 1 44 001.jpg|thumb|200px|Cosmic rays are "anti-gamma"]]
'''[[Glossary:Cosmic Radiation|Cosmic radiation]]:''' Cosmic radiation is the "opposite" of [[Glossary:Gamma Radiation|gamma radiation]].{{r|Immortal Hulk #44|45}}{{r|Immortal Hulk #50}} [[James Darnell (Earth-616)|X-Ray]] used this fact to weaken Hulk or even transform him back into Banner.{{r|Incredible Hulk #276}}{{r|Immortal Hulk #44|45}} The [[U-Foes (Earth-616)|U-Foes]] once even killed the Hulk with these "anti-gamma" rays and sent him to the [[Below-Place]], but they made the mistake of constantly feeding him cosmic rays. The cosmic rays seeped into the Below-Place, got absorbed by Joe Fixit, and turned him into a Red Hulk. The Red Hulk then smashed through the [[Green Door|Red Door]] that was keeping him in the Below-Place and Hulk came back to life, empowered by cosmic rays.{{r|Immortal Hulk #45}}

'''Gas Inhalation:''' Great doses of gas can temporarily neutralize the Hulk.{{r|Captain America #257}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #149}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #112}} However, it is not an insurmountable obstacle, since the Hulk can dissipate the gas with a powerful thunderclap, destabilizing the opponent with the resulting shockwaves.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 20}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #2001}} The Hulk has also occasionally resisted that.{{r|Incredible Hulk #455}}

'''[[Adamantium]] and [[Vibranium]] Blades:''' They have been shown capable of piercing the Hulk's skin; [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]], and the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]]'s claws can pierce it.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #1}}{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #3}} However, as the Hulk's rage increases they become progressively less effective, reaching an stage where they are completely unable to harm him.{{r|Incredible Hulk #181}}{{r|Wolverine: Origins #28}}{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 15}}

'''Adrenaline Suppression:''' Adrenaline inhibitors can be administered via syringes of Adamantium and Vibranium, aiming to revert the transformation. Amplified quantities can accomplish this purpose.{{r|AAFES Vol 1 7}} However, the Hulk has also withstood substances intended to sedate him by tactile contact.{{r|Incredible Hulk #199}}

'''Toxic Substances:''' Once, [[Carmilla Black (Earth-616)|Scorpion (Carmilla Black)]] injected him with a toxin especially designed to counteract the efficiency of the Hulk's healing factor. However, if the Hulk gets angry enough he can nullify this effect, as he quickly demonstrated.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 110}}

''' Rage Nullification:''' The Hulk's rage also can be neutralized; certain individuals can calm the Hulk down. [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Betty Ross]]{{r|Incredible Hulk #141}} and [[Sentry]]{{r|Sentry/Hulk #1}} successfully calmed the Hulk down in several instances. Telepaths with vast empathy potential can theoretically emulate this effect. The Inhuman [[Randall Jessup (Earth-616)|Randall Jessup]]'s ability to siphon away negative emotions makes him a particularly effective deterrent to the Hulk's rage factor.{{r|Indestructible Hulk Vol 1 19.INH}}

'''Strength Increasing Factor:''' The Hulk normally doesn't achieve high-end strength in the first moments after his transformation.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #3}} Unless there is a substantial and significant event that breaks Banner's restraints and triggers far superior amounts of adrenaline in his circulatory system, he can theoretically be defeated in earlier stages of transformation. His strength level at any given moment may still be inferior to that of his opponents.

'''Magic:''' Since the Hulk is empowered by dark magic,{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 82}}{{r|Darkness/Incredible Hulk Vol 1}} it is not properly a weakness. However, depending upon the Hulk's emotional state, his incarnation, and the power magnitude of the magic manipulator, this could be a potential threat.{{r|Tales to Astonish #101}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #102}}{{r|Incredible Hulks #622}} However, the Hulk has also been shown to be injured more easily by enchanted weapons than regular weapons.{{r|Defenders #1}}

'''Special Conditions:''' The Hulk can be hurt or killed by Cosmic entities and individuals with similar extraordinary levels of power. Under some conditions, he is more susceptible to mental manipulation by exceptionally powerful telepaths. In this context, the psionic control efficiency is inversely proportional to the Hulk's rage level.{{r|Incredible Hulk #203}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #217}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Weaknesses
| body  = '''UV Radiation:''' Due to the nature of the Devil Hulk, Banner is now vulnerable to concentrated UV radiation, which nullifies his Hulk transformation and reverts him back to human form.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 7}}{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 17}}{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 23}} He was eventually able to overcome this by working with the Devil Hulk.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 27}}
}}

| Equipment               = '''BannerTech PDA:''' Banner has a mobile operating system that can hack sophisticated systems within moments and seems to be controlled mentally for the most part.

'''BannerTech Shield/Gamma Dome Generator:''' Banner has created a gamma and old power fueled shield that protects him from most physical harm. It has been shown to protect him from beings as strong as Skaar and the Juggernaut. Banner is able to extend this shield to cover several other people and also redirect the energy to increase his strength.

'''BannerTech Satchel:''' Banner has a pocket teleporter in his satchel with which he can reach into his bag and grab things from his lab.

'''BannerTech Wrist-Watch Teleporter:''' A pocket sized teleport device Banner can spontaneously warp himself and others across vast distanced with.

A molecular repulsion field that could be used to simulate levitation.

A mini electromagnetic pulse blast.

'''BannerTech Nanoparticulates:''' microrobotic-particles able to hack and disable technological weapons. 

'''BannerTech Flyspy Cams:''' A spybot with hosts of scanners that are constantly performing advanced diagnostics on everyone within 50 feet of him, he also uses them to carry out thorough bioscans of a particular set of individuals under his surveillance.

Banner used to sew a survival kit into his pants so whenever he woke up, he could survive anywhere. The kit included a needle and thread, a pack of waterproof matches, and a debit card.{{r|Hulk: Let the Battle Begin #1}}

After joining S.H.I.E.L.D., Banner was able to build new technologies to help mankind:
* Banner has created a purification unit that could prevent all waterborne disasters for the next five years.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #1}}
* Banner has made the catalytic converter, which could save countless from smoking induced cancers.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #2}}
* Banner has designed a suit of his own, but its maximum capabilities are unknown.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #2}} Since, unlike the Hulk, Banner cannot breathe underwater, hence the suit enables Banner to breathe in oxygen-less environments.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #5}} The suit also allows him to survive absolute zero temperatures.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #8}}
* Banner also has constructed a contact lens which allows him to operate it like a computer. Using this he can monitor his vital functions.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #1}}

| Transportation          = When he lost his ability to turn into the Hulk, Banner reversed engineered the Leader's teleportation technology and used it as a transportation device.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 601}}
| Weapons                 = '''Old Power Taser:''' A stun gun built combining Old Strong power in conjunction with Bruce's Gamma Rays, emits pulses that are so strong the effects are measured on the Richter Scale. At a 1.4 it was able to send Logan clear across the street and according to Banner on a 6.9, it would be able to kill him.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 603}}

'''BannerTech Stun Gun:''' Handheld electrode discharging pistol which could be utilized to paralyze and incapacitate opponents, even affecting the likes of the [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]] in singular uses. According to Banner, prolonged application of said tool would have overwhelmed his durability and recovery capacity, leaving him indefinitely paralyzed.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 21}}

'''[[Hammer of Nul]]:''' As one of the Worthy,{{r|Fear Itself Vol 1 2}} the Hulk used it for melee and ranged combat that even enabled him to take on Thor, wielder of Mjolnir.{{r|Fear Itself Vol 1 4}}

| Notes                   = 
*Banner's identity is publicly known; however, the public does not know Joe Fixit was the Hulk.{{r|World War Hulk: Gamma Files Vol 1 1}}
*Bruce Banner is a graduate of ''Desert State University'' in Navapo, [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #130}} His college roommate was [[Peter Corbeau (Earth-616)|Peter Corbeau]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #148}}
*Bruce Banner is of French descent. He had an ancestor who fought for France in World War I.{{r|Incredible Hulk #135}}
*Banner is an atheist.{{r|Incredible Hulks Vol 1 622}}
*Hulk was initially gray-colored but, as the gamma radiation raged through his body, it was eventually turned green. The Hulk has reverted back to his gray skin tone a couple of times.{{Citation}}
*Through the transformation from Banner to the Hulk, his jeans or pants are generally the only item of clothing to sustain the shear forces in a muscular explosion.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 1}}
*[[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] once managed to "defeat" the Hulk by telling a joke which made him calm down and turn to his Bruce Banner alter-ego to laugh.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #2}} Another time, after Hulk was seduced by [[Umar (Earth-616)|Umar]], the Hulk was so satisfied that he reverted back to Bruce Banner, and wouldn't turn back into Hulk.{{r|Defenders Vol 3 2}}
*The fact that Bruce has turned into the Hulk without the use of anger or increased heart rate reveals that the adrenaline that Bruce uses to turn into the Hulk may simply be a catalyst, and that his transformation may be more psychological than physical. This implies that he can transform at will.{{r|World War Hulk: Gamma Files Vol 1 1}}
*Because of his troubled childhood and his identity disorder, Bruce is the only Hulk that does not fully control both of his forms, unlike the Red Hulk, the She-Hulk, and other Hulk entities.{{Citation}}
*Bruce set up a benefit corporation to administer his patents in order to collect money for victims of his rampages. By the time of his death, he had used it to give 230 million dollars to victims.{{r|Civil War II: The Fallen Vol 1 1}}
*[[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] briefly ran into Bruce Banner in [[Softlands|Purgatory]] at the time Bruce was dead following his brief resurrection in ''Uncanny Avengers''.{{r|Star-Lord Annual Vol 1 1}}
*Devil Hulk remembers how Spider-Man revealed his secret identity to the world, implying he was immune to Doctor Strange's spell. Bruce Banner, on the other hand, was affected and doesn't recall his identity. How the spell affected his other personalities is unknown.{{r|Immortal Hulk: Great Power Vol 1 1}}
| Trivia                  = * Years before Hulk became a part of the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] with [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]], [[Stan Lee]] considered merging their solo features in ''[[Tales to Astonish Vol 1|Tales to Astonish]]'' by making them form a team called "the Invaders." The idea was dropped, and years later, the name of the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]] was used by [[Roy Thomas|Roy Thomas]] when he pitched the idea of a team of superheroes set during WWII.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/hulk-namor-invaders/|title=Comic Legends: Did the Hulk and Namor Almost Form Their Own Team?|work=CBR.com|first=Brian|last=Cronin|date=31 August 2018|accessdate=31 August 2018}}}}
*The Merged Hulk was briefly renamed "The Professor" during writer Paul Jenkins' run, as a "revelation" that the Merged Hulk was not actually a merger of the three personalities but rather a separate personality altogether. Unlike the Merged Hulk, the Professor was physically distinguished by having a ponytail, which the Merged Hulk did not. However, these parts of Jenkins' run and Bruce Jones' entire run on the book, including "The Professor", "The Guilt Hulk", and "The Devil Hulk", were later retconned into hallucinations created by Nightmare, when writer Peter David returned to the title.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 81}} However, another retcon revealed that the Devil Hulk was indeed a real persona, not a hallucination;{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 15}} and the Guilt Hulk resurfaced in {{cl|Symbiote Spider-Man: Crossroads Vol 1 3}} as a real persona controlled by or believing itself to be [[Brian Banner (Earth-616)|Brian Banner]].
*According to him, the "Hulk loves puppies." S.H.I.E.L.D. once used a bunch of them to transform him back to Banner after a mission.{{r|Indestructible Hulk Special #1}} Similarly, the Hulk has claimed his favorite animals are dogs.{{r|Incredible Hulk #180}}
*When asked by Iron Man why build the gamma bomb, he said he wanted gamma energy to power the world, but got no funds and had to transform it into a weapon to get government funds.{{r|Indestructible Hulk Annual Vol 1 1}}
*An hour of his Hulk persona being in control equals to 7.3 hours of sleep to his Bruce Banner persona.{{r|Avengers: Millennium Infinite Comic Vol 1 5}}
*Hulk was ranked as 9th on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes in 2011.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/lists/comic-book-heroes/9|title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes|work=IGN.com|first=|last=|date=|accessdate=21 February 2019}}}}
*Hulk was also ranked as 4th in "The Top 50 Avengers."<ref>[https://www.ign.com/lists/avengers/4 The Hulk as the 4th top Avenger at IGN's official site]</ref>
*Stan Lee revealed that Hulk went from gray to green because at the time, Marvel had ink problems, causing the strips to look weird. So when Lee was asked to change Hulk's color, it became green, because it looked like a monster the most. He revealed this in the [[Hulk (film)|2003 movie]]'s bonuses.
*In ''Hulk: The Incredible Guide'' and the [[Hulk (film)|2003 movie]], [[Stan Lee|Stan Lee]] revealed the Hulk was based on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as well as Frankenstein.
*Australian actor Eric Bana portrayed Bruce Banner, the Hulk in the 2003 film version directed by Ang Lee. Edward Norton plays Bruce Banner in the 2008 reboot of ''The Incredible Hulk'' directed by Louis Leterrier.{{r|The Incredible Hulk (film)}}
**Ang Lee actually played the action scenes with the Incredible Hulk in motion capture, while Eric Bana is used to model the green behemoth's face.
*Lou Ferrigno starred in the 1970s television series of the same name as the character -- from Universal Studios and not Marvel Comics -- opposite Bill Bixby, who portrayed the David Banner persona instead of the true version; however, this did not follow the original plot from the comics. In the television series, Banner's first name was changed from Robert to David and he was never called by his middle name Bruce, only David. On the DVD commentary of the pilot, series developer and executive producer Kenneth Johnson explained that it was a way to honor his late son David. Also, according to Stan Lee, Universal changed the name because "Bruce" sounded, in the eyes of the network, like a "gay" name, and David sounded much better.{{Citation}} "Bruce" ultimately became the TV Banner's middle name, as it had been in the comics, visible on Banner's tombstone at the end of the pilot episode.{{Citation}}
[[File:Fantastic Four Vol 1 28 Letters Page 001.jpg|thumb]]
*Stan Lee never intended The Hulk's identity to be Robert Bruce Banner. Stan ran the first issues with Bruce Banner, then mistakenly ran some more with Bob Banner. Notified of his mistake, he announced the name of the Hulk's alter ego was Robert Bruce Banner.
*While the Hulk was intended to be the physically strongest character in Marvel, at the time Stan Lee created Thor in 1963, he intended to make a character who was "stronger than the Hulk, and smarter than Reed Richards, in a godly wisdom aspect." However, it should be noted that the above was simply Stan's intention in 1963, and whereas the Hulk has continuously grown in power since then, Thor has not. Under Stan Lee's watch, 10 years later during the 1970s, the Hulk stalemated Thor in strength,{{r|Defenders #10}} and during the late 1980s Stan wrote a Thor issue in which the title character was clearly outmatched against the Hulk without using Mjolnir.{{r|Thor #385}} His current, 2013, view on the topic, is that it simply depends on if the writer is a Hulk fan or a Thor fan. The subject over which titular hero is the strongest is the source of many debates between comic book fans.
*In DC Comics' [[w:c:dc:Doomsday Clock Vol 1 12|''Doomsday Clock'' #12]], when [[w:c:dc:Jonathan Osterman (Watchmen)|Doctor Manhattan]] looks forward into the history of [[w:c:dc:Superman (Clark Kent)|Superman]], he refers to Hulk (as a green behemoth) alongside Thor as part of an alleged event bound to happen in the year 2030 named the "Secret Crisis". In this story, Superman would be thrown into a brawl with Hulk and Thor, with [[w:c:dc:Doomsday (Prime Earth)|Doomsday]] dying to protect him against them.
*In {{cl|Tarot Vol 1 3}} the two halves of Hulk merged with the halves of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] to create [[Captain Cosmos (Earth-616)|Captain Cosmos]] and [[Hulkoid (Earth-616)|Hulkoid]].
