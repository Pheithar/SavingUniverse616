===First and second line-ups===
After the original X-Force seemed to sacrifice themselves, producer [[Spike (Freeman) (Earth-616)|Spike Freeman]] thought up an idea to have a public [[Homo superior|mutant]] team with government backing, under the management of [[Coach (Earth-616)|Coach]].

Most of the original members were killed, especially in a disastrous mission trying to save the 'boy band' pop group Boyz R' Us from kidnappers. This was secretly planned by [[Coach (Earth-616)|Coach]] and [[Axel Cluney (Earth-616)|Zeitgeist]], who felt the body count and changing rosters would add interest. Zeitgeist was regretful though, and ended up being one of the members killed, and only [[Edith Sawyer (Earth-616)|U-Go Girl]] and the recent recruit [[Tike Alicar (Earth-616)|Anarchist]] survived.{{r|X-Force #116}}

Based on those two and on [[Guy Smith (Earth-616)|Mister Sensitive]], a new roster was set up. The team also quickly fight with the original [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]], led by [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]], for the name of the team.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 117}}

Under the Orphan (Mister Sensitive)'s lead, the team started act also in a less interested way, saving a mutant child, [[Paco Perez (Earth-616)|Paco Perez]], from military interest and disobeying to the Coach.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 #118|119}}

[[Coach (Earth-616)|Coach]] tried to rape [[Edith Sawyer (Earth-616)|U-Go Girl]] and kill the Orphan on two occasions, helped by [[Smoke (Earth-616)|Smoke]] and [[Succubus (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Succubus]], but failed and the three were killed.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 #119|120}}

X-Force was among the numerous heroes captured by [[Franklin Hall (Earth-616)|Graviton]] and freed by the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]].{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 #57|58}}

===Targeted by the Brotherhood===
X-Force performed a mission in [[Japan]], against the [[Tokyo]] Cell of the mutant terrorist [[Brotherhood (Earth-616)|Brotherhood]], terminating all members of the group. In response, their leader [[Marvin Hoffman (Earth-616)|X]] gathered the remaining members of the falling-apart Brotherhood to hit X-Force, targeting especially [[Doop (Earth-616)|Doop]] the heart of the team, to both target what X sees as mutant collaborators to the system, and to send a message to mutantkind: Or they were with the Brotherhood, or they were against them. The murder attempted ended in a bloodbath, as the X-Force kill them without questioning and some Brotherhood's members fight each other. As the Orphan wondered what had just happened there, Edith answered that the Revolution was over, leaving the devastated field. Once more, [[Woodstock Schumaker (Earth-616)|Lacuna]] was seen with them, on publicities or during the parade. Therefore, she wasn't seen fighting either the Brotherhood Tokyo Cell or their last gathering.{{r|Brotherhood Vol 1 #8|9}}

===New Name===
As X-Force had to change name because of the [[X-Force (Earth-616)|original team]] pressure and because [[Spike (Freeman) (Earth-616)|Spike Freeman]] had money to pay every month to the original team, Edie finally proposed '''X-Statix'''. [[Spike (Freeman) (Earth-616)|Spike Freeman]] refused, as his collaborators had chosen another name, but Edie's name captured the attention of the public and was chosen (thank to Lacuna's emission), and was adopted by Freeman.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 #128|129}}

Freeman himself was killed after trying to have [[Woodstock Schumaker (Earth-616)|Lacuna]] murdered.

After saving [[Doop (Earth-616)|Doop]] from government hands, the remaining members decided to retire. However, on their last mission, a group of unknown gunmen ambushed them, apparently killing all.{{r|X-Statix #26}}

Only Doop has resurfaced since, joining the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]] on [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]]'s proposition.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #1}}

===Return===
When [[Katie Sawyer (Earth-616)|Katie Sawyer]], daughter of [[Edith Sawyer (Earth-616)|U-Go Girl]], was captured by [[Axel Cluney (Earth-616)|Zeitgeist]] and his team, the [[X-Cellent (Earth-616)|X-Cellent]] for her powers. The team was needed to reunite. [[Dead Girl (Moonbeam) (Earth-616)|Dead Girl]] and [[Doop (Earth-616)|Doop]] grabbed the once-dead [[Guy Smith (Earth-616)|Mister Sensitive]] and [[Myles Alfred (Earth-616)|Vivisector]]. They moved on to some of their teammates children. [[Michael Alicar (Earth-616)|The A]], son of [[Tike Alicar (Earth-616)|Anarchist]], and [[Phatty (Earth-616)|Phatty]], daughter of [[William Robert Reilly (Earth-616)|Phat]], were both recruited. After the battle, they teleported out. Katie declined at first, but soon accepted to join as their teleporter.{{r|Giant-Size X-Statix Vol 1 1}}

==Commercial and promotion aspects==
This X-Force was focused on the creation of fame and money.

Owned and financed by [[Spike (Freeman) (Earth-616)|Spike Freeman]], a young and arrogant trimillionaire, they were tasked to perform video-recorded missions (with [[Doop (Earth-616)|Doop]] as their cameraman) proposed by various sources, and all intended to create a spectacular and bloody show, with high kill-rates.

In order to produce more money, in addition to the TV show, a network of [[X-Force Café|X-Force Cafés]] ran by franchise-holders was created, selling many kind of merchandising, and creating a few minor events or meetings on some occasions. 

Several Fan Clubs were also set up, focused on the whole team,{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 41}} or on some members.{{r|X-Statix Vol 1 2}}

Every information, such as the death of members or the new recruitments, was treated by marketing counsellors in order to produce suspense and catch the customers' and fans' attention in order to make them buy more products.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 129}}

The team was also tasked to inaugurate various public and private buildings such as malls or the [[Doop Kiddies Hospital]],{{r|X-Force Vol 1 129}} and also to attend Conferences.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 41}}

Among the various stuff produced by or around the team are also the "X-Statix Mega Lottery".{{r|X-Statix Vol 1 4}} 

Additionally to X-Force/X-Statix merchandising, every members had their personal agent, agenda and merchandising, as [[William Robert Reilly (Earth-616)|Phat]] who had a range of weight-watching products, "Phat no more".{{r|X-Statix Vol 1 1}}

Additionally, others shows pop out around X-Force/X-Statix. First, [[Woodstock Schumaker (Earth-616)|Lacuna]] rejected an asked membership to create '''Lacuna and the Stars''', using her powers to infiltrate and drag intel about useless things about the stars, focussing on X-Statix. Later, the show [[O-Force (Earth-616)|O-Force]] was launch by [[Solomon O'Sullivan (Earth-616)|Solomon O'Sullivan]] as a concurrent team, where the membership was decided by public's vote and no internal selection.{{r|X-Statix Vol 1 #1|#3}}

| Notes                   = For being a mercantile team with no interest in the social fights for their kind but only for fame and money, this group was blamed by many mutants, including the original [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]]{{r|X-Force Vol 1 117}}, [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]{{r|X-Force Vol 1 120}} or the [[Brotherhood (Earth-616)|Brotherhood]].{{r|Brotherhood Vol 1 #8|9}} Also, they made induced a confusion in the public's mind, giving a false image of the mutants conditions.{{r|Chamber Vol 1 1}}

| Trivia                  = As X-Force had to change name, 
* The [[Guy Smith (Earth-616)|Orphan]] proposed '''X-Division''' and '''X-Heroes'''.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 125}} 
* [[Myles Alfred (Earth-616)|Vivisector]] thought about '''X-Foliates'''.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 125}} 
* A reporter talked about a rumor about '''[[X-squads|X-Squad]]'''.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 126}} 
* [[Edith Sawyer (Earth-616)|U-Go Girl]] proposed '''[[X-Men]]''' ("the perfect name for a group of [[Homo superior|mutants]] with the [[X-Gene]]").{{r|X-Force Vol 1 126}} and later '''X-Statix'''.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 #128|129}}
*[[Spike (Freeman) (Earth-616)|Spike Freeman]] was proposed by his collaborators the name of '''X-Storm'''.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 #129}}

----

In order to possess always ready members to be incorporated to the current line-up to replace deceased members, [[Spike (Freeman) (Earth-616)|Spike Freeman]] has set several "farms", with X-Forces in training. Among the potential recruits were referenced [[Arlo Summers (Earth-616)|Anti-Matter (Arlo Summers)]], [[James Hutchinson (Earth-616)|Sycamore]], [[John Lopez (Earth-616)|Washout]], [[Thomas Williams (Earth-616)|Mant]], [[Matt Corbin (Earth-616)|Lightning Bug]],{{r|X-Force Vol 1 #129}} and [[Timmy Glenn (Earth-616)|Corkscrew]].{{r|X-Statix Vol 1 1}}
