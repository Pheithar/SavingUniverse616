===Early Life===
Georges Batroc was born and raised in [[Marseilles]], [[France]], when he was old enough he joined the [[French Foreign Legion (Earth-616)|French Foreign Legion]]. He soon left and became a mercenary, gaining the nickname "Batroc the Leaper" due to his specialty in savate (also known as "La Boxe Française"), a form of French kickboxing.{{r|Tales of Suspense #75}} 

===Mercenary===
Now a mercenary he was hired by [[THEM (Earth-616)|THEM]] to steal the [[Inferno 42]] cylinder. This is when he first fought [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] during this mission. When Batroc introduced himself with typical bluster, Cap revealed, to Batroc's delight, that he had already heard of the mercenary.{{r|Tales of Suspense #75}}{{r|Tales of Suspense #76}}

Later, he was hired by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] to abduct [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]]. He lured Cap into a trap, in which he insisted Hydra not intervene, and again lost; however, when Hydra agents prepared to kill both Cap and Batroc, Batroc, incensed at such "men wizout honair," switched sides to help Cap against Hydra.{{r|Tales of Suspense #85}}

===Batroc's Brigade===
He sometimes works by himself, and sometimes employing helpers referred to as [[Batroc's Brigade (Earth-616)|Batroc's Brigade]].

Batroc and his Brigade teamed up to battle Cap again.{{r|Captain America #149}} However it turned out it wasn't the [[Stranger]], but [[Jakar (Earth-616)|Jakar]] who had contracted the Leaper to abduct children. He wanted to use their life energy to bring his people out of a species wide paralytic coma. Cap convinced Jakar that his wife would despise him for using innocent lives to save her.{{r|Captain America #150}}

===Iron Fist===
When [[Iron Fist]] tried to clear his name with [[Joy Meachum (Earth-616)|Joy Meachum]], she still will not believe him, and her [[Ward Meachum (Earth-616)|Uncle Ward]] has him attacked by his latest paid assassin: Batroc. Batroc has an army of assassins to try and defeat Iron Fist, however Daniel is able to hold them at bay, and eventually defeat them all.{{r|Marvel Premiere #20}} Batroc angrily left the Meachum building over a dispute about his payment.{{r|Marvel Premiere #21}}

Having discovered a creature from another dimension, Batroc attempted to steal transuranium, but was stopped by Captain America and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Marvel Team-Up #52}}

===Defenders===
Batroc later joined a villainous version of the [[Defenders (Villains) (Earth-616)|Defenders]].{{r|Defenders #63}} They committed crimes to tarnish their name, but they were defeated by the actual [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]].{{r|Defenders #64}}

Mr. Hyde threatened to kill thousands of people.{{r|Captain America #251}} Batroc showed again that there was a line he would not cross. He and Cap teamed up to take down Mr. Hyde.{{r|Captain America #252}}

===Lethal Legion===
Batroc joined the [[Lethal Legion (Porcupine) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]] led by the [[Porcupine]]. They were involved in a huge, pointless brawl with a group of random superheroes. What they actually wanted, if anything, is unclear.{{r|Marvel Age Annual #1}}

===New Brigade===
The next iteration of Batroc's Brigade were Batroc, [[Maximillian Zaran (Earth-616)|Zaran]], and [[Ferdinand Lopez (Earth-616)|Machete]], formed by Batroc to steal [[Captain America's Shield|Captain America's shield]].{{r|Captain America #302|303}}

[[Buck Chisholm (Earth-616)|Trick Shot]] then hired Batroc and his Brigade to take out the Avenger [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]].{{r|Solo Avengers #3}}

===Baron Zemo===
[[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Helmut Zemo]] hired Batroc's Brigade to retrieve fragments of the [[Bloodstone]]. They battled Cap and [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]].{{r|Captain America #357|362}}

===Eurohit===
Batroc was next employed by the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]], who was attempting to gain a business foothold in [[Europe]]. His cadre to spearhead the operation included Batroc, [[Roussel Dupont (Earth-616)|Rapido]], the assassin [[Aaron Cashin (Earth-616)|Snakebite]], and wheelman [[Armand Chauffard (Earth-616)|Chauffard]].

This team was tasked with assassinating key European crime leaders to create a vacuum for the Kingpin to fill. During the assignment they repeatedly clashed with the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] and his ally [[Morgan Sinclair (Earth-616)|Morgan Sinclair]]. But the mercs were generally successful and kept ahead of the opposition.

During this campaign, Batroc went for Castle. He caught up with the Punisher’s Jaguar convertible on a stolen motorbike, leapt from the bike into the Jaguar and beat the Punisher up. While he had the upper hand, Batroc was defeated when Sinclair stomped on the brake at a critical moment, ejecting him from the car.

The Punisher gathered more allies including the South American criminal [[Luis Alvarez (Earth-616)|Tarantula]]. Batroc wanted to duel him. Batroc disguised himself as a security guard during a London operation, and did get his solo shot at Alvarez. Batroc dominated the fight and won, but he was hit by one of Tarantula’s poisoned spikes, and had to run away to find an antidote.{{r|Punisher Vol 2 65|70}}

===Crossbones===
Cap disguised as "[[Crossbones]]" ran into Batroc, who reminded him of an old wager that Crossbones could defeat any five men in unarmed combat.

==="Death" of Captain America===
Batroc numbered among the many who mourned the "death" of Captain America, tearfully declaring "I will miss you, ''mon ami"'' out of respect for a brother warrior.{{r|Captain America #443}}

While the heroes were away fighting the [[Secret Wars (1984 Event)|Secret Wars]], New York Police Department faced many supervillains, including Batroc.{{r|Code of Honor #3}}

===Justice League===
When the [[Wikipedia:Justice League|Justice League]] came to the Marvel Universe; Batroc briefly confronted [[w:c:DC:Bruce Wayne (New Earth)|Batman]] when he was one of the villains recruited by Krona for his army.{{r|JLA/Avengers #4}}

===Batroc's Daughter===
Batroc has a daughter who teamed up with the daughter of similar B-List supervillain Tarantula. Both daughters adopted their fathers' respective costumes and titles. Taskmaster expressed his shock that Tarantula and Batroc were heterosexual before soundly beating the two villains' offspring, tossing them effortlessly off of a building, noting that he also "hates ethnic stereotypes."{{r|Agent X #6}}

===Invasion of Wakanda===
[[File:George Batroc (Earth-616) from Black Panther Vol 4 5 0001.png|thumb|right]]
Batroc was among the villains hired by Wallace [[Klaw]] for his invasion of [[Wakanda]].{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 4 3}}-[[Black Panther Vol 4 4|4]]}}

While the [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]], the [[Augustine du Lac (Earth-616)|Black Knight]], Klaw, and [[Nigandan Army (Earth-616)|Nigandan]] troops were battling on the frontline, Batroc and Klaw targeted [[Ramonda (Earth-616)|Queen Mother Ramonda]] in her personal apartments.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 5}}

Taking her as hostage, Klaw intended to force T'Challa to commit suicide, but the [[S'Yan (Earth-616)|Black Panther S'Yan]] and a couple of [[Dora Milaje (Earth-616)|Dora Milaje]] intervened and the two groups fought. While Klaw was in [[Cyberspace]], Batroc was beaten and tied up. After Klaw's death, Batroc remained in T'Challa's custody, wounded.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 6}}

===Great Lakes Avengers===
[[Douglas Taggert (Earth-616)|Grasshopper]] came across Batroc's Brigade breaking into the building and decided to try and stop them. The Great Lakes Avengers rush to aid Grasshopper with the robbery and ask him to join the team, Grasshopper accepts shortly before Zaran throws a dagger at his head.{{r|G.L.A. #2}} They tried to stop the Brigade with little results.{{r|{{cl|G.L.A. Vol 1 3}}-[[G.L.A. Vol 1 4|4]]}}

===London===
Batroc travelled to [[London (England)|London]] to try and convince Zaran and [[Mariano Lopez (Earth-616)|Machete]] to leave [[Radically Advanced Ideas in Destruction (Earth-616)|R.A.I.D.]], as he was against causing massive civilian casualties. The villains, however, would not listen to reason. Batroc was then approached by [[Joseph Chapman (Earth-616)|Union Jack]] who was seeking Batroc's friends in the hopes of stopping R.A.I.D. before it was too late. Batroc escaped, but did leave his cell phone behind with Zaran's number in it for the hero to find. Union Jack used this to track the position of the mercenaries and prevented the assassination of the British Houses of Parliament.{{r|Union Jack Vol 2 1}}

Batroc later battled [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] when he was working for [[Daniel Gump (Earth-616)|Daniel Gump]], a mob boss with powers derived from having sold his soul to [[Vetis (Earth-616)|Vetis]], as the Merc with a Mouth was being blackmailed by said demon to kill those who had made pacts with him. Deadpool broke Batroc's leg.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 10}} Because of this, Batroc held a grudge towards Wilson, and was one of the criminals contacted by [[Agent Gorman (Earth-616)|Gorman]], a corrupt S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who also wanted to kill Deadpool.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 21}} Batroc confronted Deadpool, but he quickly incapacitated Batroc and promised to kill him the next time they crossed paths.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 22}} Batroc later came across Deadpool in a subway, but got out alive because Wilson was under the control of his pacifist persona, Zenpool, at the time.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 37}}

[[File:Georges Batroc (Earth-616) from All-New Captain America Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
===All-New Captain America===
When All-New Captain America [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Sam Wilson]], with Steve Rogers' son [[Ian Rogers (Earth-616)|Nomad]], came to [[Ecuador]]'s Hydra base to neutralize it, Batroc was defending a machine that was absorbing the blood of an unknown boy. Wilson and Nomad engaged the mercenary to save the kid, with Georges almost defeating Cap. When Batroc was going to kill Sam Wilson, Ian Zola arrived and hit him with his [[Horde Crusher]] causing his fall, apparently killing the Leaper.{{r|All-New Captain America #1}}

Having survived the fall, Batroc reappeared to take revenge on Ian for trying to kill him when he and Wilson were heading to France to thwart Hydra's plan to spread the Lucas' (the Inhuman boy that Cap and Nomad saved from Batroc) blood, which contains an toxin capable of sterilizing human beings, upon the world.{{r|All-New Captain America #5}} Batroc was thrown out of the Hydra base they were in by Ian, falling to his death once again.{{r|All-New Captain America #6}}

===Agent of M.O.D.O.K.===
Having survive his encounter with Captain America, Batroc started working as a mercenary for an organization named [[Mercenary Organization Dedicated Only to Killing (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]] (Mercenary Organization Dedicated Only to Killing), led by the villain of the [[M.O.D.O.K. Superior (Earth-616)|same name]]. He was one of M.O.D.O.K.'s elite operatives, together with chemist [[Mega Tony (Earth-616)|Mega Tony]] and sorceress [[Terrible Eye (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Terrible Eye]]. Batroc was the first member of M.O.D.O.K. to find out their newest recruit, [[Gwendolyn Poole (Earth-TRN565)|Gwen Poole]] had actually no skills or powers whatsoever.{{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 2}} He was going to tell on her, but she convinced not to, so he instead helped her train.{{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 3}}

Shortly after Gwen overthrew their boss and became leader of M.O.D.O.K.,{{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 4}} Batroc and the other elite members were kidnapped by an army of [[Teuthidans]]. The aliens had invaded Earth looking for Gwen, who had allegedly killed a platoon of their soldiers, a mission she had actually taken the credit for. M.O.D.O.K's benefactor, [[Vincent Doonan (Earth-616)|Vincent Doonan]], even assisted the aliens in kidnapping Gwen's allies for leverage. He believed Gwen's plan to deal with the invasion was too irresponsible and chaotic, and believing forcing Gwen to surrender to the Teuthidans was a much more peaceful option.{{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 8}}

Gwen managed to defeat the Teuthidans and rescue her friends at the cost of M.O.D.O.K.'s mobile base. With the base and its equipment lost, and any ties with their backer surely cut, Batroc, Terrible Eye, and Mega Tony decided to dissolve M.O.D.O.K. and part their own ways, much to Gwen's dismay.{{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 10}}

Disguised as a father and daughter to get inside, Batroc and Gwen broke into [[Nicholas Powell (Earth-616)|Chance's]] [[Palace (Casino)|flying casino]] to steal money, with Gwen holding back the comic sound effects so Batroc could kick down the vault door. Though they escaped with the gold bars, Gwen intended to become a supervillain so her comic run could survive, but Batroc noted he had specifically chosen a job to rob a villain, meaning her share could help her be a hero. Believing herself unable to be a hero nor villain and that her story was ending, Gwen parted ways with Batroc, telling him that future writers would not remember to write him as she knew him. {{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 24}} Batroc later reunited with Gwen and the rest of the former M.O.D.O.K. agents in anticipation for M.O.D.O.K. Superior's return to [[Earth]]. He swore revenge upon them only for their collective might to scare him off. {{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 25}}
