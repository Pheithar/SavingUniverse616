===Origin===

===[[Forgotten Reign]]===
-->
===Deposed King===
After [[Agon (Earth-616)|Agon]] and [[Rynda (Earth-616)|Rynda]] were killed in a tragic accident, a new wise king started rulling [[Attilan]]. One day, when he and the two princes, [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]] and [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]], were contemplating a new monument the [[Alpha Primitives]] were building, they were attacked with neural inhibitors and the king was rendered unconscious. The princes began fighting to protect the King and, after Black Bolt's voice blacked every attacker out,{{r|Inhumans: Once and Future Kings Vol 1 1}} Maximus killed [[Dkamas (Earth-616)|Dkamas]], the leader of the Uprising.{{r|Inhumans: Once and Future Kings Vol 1 2}}

Later, the corrupt viceroy [[Kadlec (Earth-616)|Kadlec the Seeker]] led the king to suspect the young princes were conspiring to steal the throne, and [[Elisha (Alpha Primitive) (Earth-616)|Elisha]], one of the Alpha Primitives, convinced the two brothers that the king was plotting their demise, due to being humiliated when they saved his life. When Kadlec branded [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] as a traitor, she and the two brothers escaped with Elisha and [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]] to [[New York City]].{{r|Inhumans: Once and Future Kings Vol 1 1}}

After this, the king dispatched Kadlec and [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]] to bring the teens back, but Karnak betrayed Kadlec and escaped to search for his missing brother [[Triton (Earth-616)|Triton]]. Meanwhile the king had already selected [[Gorgon Petragon (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] as his new viceroy and had given him the mission of understanding the real reason the teens had fled, since he was starting to distrust Kadlec.{{r|Inhumans: Once and Future Kings Vol 1 2}}

Some time later, he stole the [[Slave Engine]], his people's greatest weapon, along with the [[Xerogen Crystals]] it utilized and buried them somewhere in [[Tibet]], for fear that it would corrupt his people and become a power too great for any Inhuman to wield. This led to a duel between himself and the heir to the throne, young [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Blackagar Boltagon]] who advocated the possession of the Slave Engine for Attilan's protection. Despite being by far the strongest of the Inhumans, moving the Slave Engine had weakened the Unspoken which led to his defeat at the hands of Blackagar and his friends. His final stipulation was that his deeds be remembered, but Black Bolt had a crueler fate in mind: the King, his deeds, and the Slave Engine itself, were written out of Inhuman history. From that day, he would be remembered only as a bogeyman to frighten small children. He would be... '''Unspoken'''.{{r|Mighty Avengers #27}}

===Isolated in the [[Himalayas]]===
He was later recovered by the [[Alpha Primitives]], who cared for their fallen king. Realizing his mistake, the Unspoken plotted to return and reclaim his throne, cultivating the Xerogen crystals, only for [[Attilan]] to rise into the sky. Cheated of his redemption and later learning of the Silent War between the Inhumans and United States of America, the Unspoken decided to change his plans and conquer Earth, unearthing the Slave Engine and planned on transforming all humans on the planet into Alpha Primitives.{{r|Mighty Avengers #27}}

===Resurfacing===
In the 21st century, the Unspoken was detected in Tibet. [[Global Reaction Agency for Mysterious Paranormal Activity (Earth-616)|G.R.A.M.P.A.]] interpreted this as a possible alliance between communist China and the Inhumans but were unable to identify the Unspoken. Therefore, they called in [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], an expert on the Inhumans, and [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|US Agent]].

The former recognized the Unspoken and advised that they call all the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] teams to stop him. Unfortunately, even the joint forces of the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|Avengers Resistance]], and [[Mighty Avengers (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]] failed to stem the tide. Most of their force were mutated by the Xerogen mists, before the [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Wasp]] arrived. They both dueled each other at massive sizes. Wasp called him pathetic, for wallowing in his own misery for his own mistakes and not learning to move on.

The Unspoken was defeated when the chronal ray onboard the Slave Engine that accelerated the growth of the Xerogen crystals was used against him, aging him to the point where he was too weak to carry on fighting. The heroes then allowed the Alpha Primitives to allow the Unspoken to return to his cave to live out the rest of his days.{{r|Mighty Avengers #27|31}}

| Powers                  = * '''[[Terrigenesis|Terrigenesis Manipulation]]:''' The Unspoken is the living embodiment of Terrigenesis itself. He is able to mentally control his own mutations when exposed to Terrigen, allowing him to manifest new abilities on command. He has demonstrated enormous physical power and strength, enormous durability, size-changing, geokinesis, creation of hard light blades, exhalation of gale-force winds, and cosmic energy manipulation abilities.{{r|Mighty Avengers #27}} According to a Distress Call from Quicksilver, the Unspoken was classified as an '''Omega Level Threat'''.{{r|Mighty Avengers #29}}

| Weaknesses              = '''Terrigenesis  Dependence''': The Unspoken requires Terrigen to manipulate in order to access his powers. Depriving him of Terrigen crystals and their mists for long enough will revert him to a baseline Inhuman.{{r|Inhuman #5}}

'''Power Limitation''': The Unspoken cannot maintain his powers indefinitely as he as only been observed accessing a handful of powers simultaneously, turning off powers as new ones are accessed.{{r|Avengers Assemble #1}}
