===Origin===
[[File:Takeshi Matsuya (Earth-616) from X-Terminators Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
Takeshi "Taki" Matsuya (松矢 隆) was placed as a student at [[Saint Simon's Academy]], a private special education elementary school, shortly after losing the use of his legs in the same accident that killed both his parents. Taki held deep feelings of resentment toward his parents for abandoning him, which further isolated him from children of his own age.{{r|X-Terminators #1}}

A computer genius and novice inventor, Taki occupied his time creating small but fantastic electronic devices. During this period of isolation, Taki first manifested his mutant ability to technoform materials to function to his specifications, even to the point of being contrary to the laws of nature and science. Shortly after first manifesting this ability, Taki was befriended by [[Arthur Maddicks|Arthur "Artie" Maddicks]] and "[[Leech (Earth-616)|Leech]]" the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlock]], two [[Homo superior|mutant]] wards of the mutant group [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]], placed at the Academy to receive a mainstream education.{{r|X-Terminators #1}}

===Inferno===
[[File:Takeshi Matsuya (Earth-616) by Schiti 002.jpg|thumb]]
[[Inferno (Event)|During a time]] when demons from the dimension called [[Limbo]] were loose on [[Earth]], Taki, Leech, and Artie were captured by a group of demons and taken to [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]], demon leader of the Limbo denizens. Supposedly N'astirh was supposed to gather them for [[S'ym (Earth-616)|S'ym]], but he instead intended to collect the mutant children to use in an intricate magical spell which would increase his own power and potentially join the dimension of Limbo to Earth forever, thereby transforming Earth into an extension of Limbo and extending N'astirh's own power.{{r|X-Terminators #1}}

Discovering that the three mutants were too old for his purposes, N'astirh ordered them killed. Takeshi was able to save their lives only by displaying his mutant technoforming ability. N'astirh then ordered him to create a supercomputer which would allow him to cast several spells at once, layering his magic. This computer increased N'astirh's power exponentially, allowing him to open a portal between Limbo and Earth more quickly, accelerating the speed at which Limbo's inhabitants could spill out.{{r|X-Terminators #3}}

Feeling responsible for the ensuing horror that subsequently overtook [[Manhattan]], Taki rebelled against N'astirh and joined with the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] and the [[X-Factor (X-Terminators)|X-Terminators]] in closing the portal. During the fight, Taki was injured, but survived. N'astirh was defeated and eventually destroyed.{{r|X-Terminators #4}}

Shortly after returning to Saint Simon's Academy, it was attacked by the [[Alliance of Evil]], who were pawns of [[Gilbert Benson (Earth-616)|Piecemeal]] and [[Erika Benson (Earth-616)|Harness]] in a plan to resurrect [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]]. Taki was again injured in the skirmish.{{r|New Mutants Annual Vol 1 7}}

On another adventure, Taki, Leech, and Artie were mistaken for aliens while joyriding in a saucer of Wiz Kid's design. However, the situation was soon resolved.{{r|New Mutants Annual Vol 1 7}}

[[File:Takeshi Matsuya (Earth-616) from X-Force Annual Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]
Taki later developed a big schoolboy crush on his teacher. When he overheard the teacher's boyfriend and discovered he was secretly a mutant-hating bigot conspiring to kill the mutants of Saint Simon's, Wiz Kid was instrumental in the boyfriend's arrest.{{r|X-Force Annual Vol 1 1}}

===[[Decimation]] & [[Avengers Academy Vol 1|Avengers Academy]]===
After the [[Decimation]], Wiz Kid used his powers to break into [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s database to list himself as "depowered".{{r|New Avengers #18}}

When the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]] relocated to [[Avengers Compound]] in [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] and expanded its student body, Wiz Kid was one of the many recruits.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 21|22}} Along with [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] and [[Steven Shaffran (Earth-616)|Ricochet]], Wiz Kid was one of the few [[Homo superior|mutants]] who chose not to join the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and other mutants on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]].{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 22}}{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 30}} Wiz Kid also felt uncomfortable with mutant kids being detained at the Avengers Compound when the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers fought the X-Men]].{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 30}} Even after [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] opened the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]] in [[Westchester County]], Wiz Kid stayed enrolled at the Avengers Academy.{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 13}}

[[File:Takeshi Matsuya (Earth-616) from S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1 001.jpg|thumb]]
When the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] were fighting [[Mother (Interdimensional Parasite) (Earth-TRN287)|Mother]] in [[Central Park]], Wiz Kid was one of the many young heroes recruited to help as part of the "Thin Spandex Line".{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 11|13}}

===[[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D]]===
Wiz Kid later appeared as a member of [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]]'s mutant sub-team [[Six (Earth-616)|The Six]] under the command of [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]]. He was seen observing the tech inside [[Peak VII|The Peak]] where he was surprised to be greeted by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]].{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1}}

* '''Technological Intuition:''' Taki has a psionic aptitude for seeing how components can work together as a machine or technological implement, which helps guide his technoforming ability. This helps him understand how to refine and improve upon existing technology as well. His abilities extend to any form of technology including mechanical, electronic, bio-technology, and "mutant technology", where individual mutants' powers are the components coming together as a larger "machine".
