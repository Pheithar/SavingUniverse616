===Early Years===
Shiro Yoshida was born into the influential [[Clan Yashida (Earth-616)|Clan Yashida]], who operates in [[Agarashima]], [[Japan]]. His mother, a survivor of the atomic bombing in [[Hiroshima]], died on the night of his birth. Raised under the influence of his uncle, [[Tomo Yoshida (Earth-616)|Tomo]], Shiro was indoctrinated into hating the Western world. When visiting the ruins of Hiroshima with his uncle, Shiro had his [[Homo superior|mutant]] powers activated, turning him into a raging furnace of atomic fire. Trained by his uncle in the use of his abilities, he was given [[Sunfire's Suit|a costume]] that evoked Japan's imperial colors. As '''Sunfire''', Shiro, alongside his uncle, planned to get revenge against his enemies, the Americans. However, Shiro's father, [[Saburo Yoshida (Earth-616)|Saburo]], as one of Japan's greatest ambassadors, advocated for pacific relations with the West, which led him to disapprove his son's vindicative tendencies. Regardless, Sunfire attacked the [[United Nations Headquarters|United Nations Plaza]] during a diplomatic ceremony held by his father, where he was stopped by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] and [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], who had detected his mutant signature. After escaping, he attempted to destroy the [[Capitol Building]], but was fended off this time by the X-Men [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]]. During the conflict, Saburo was murdered by Tomo. In a burst caused by his immediate grief, Sunfire murdered his own uncle in retaliation. As his last words, Saburo asked Shiro to live for the future and to fight for peace.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 64}}

A divided Sunfire returned orphaned to the land of the rising sun. In [[Tokyo]], he met the [[Katsuo Sasaki (Earth-616)|Dragon-Lord]], who sought to restore Japan's status as a world power by threatening the world and found in Sunfire an agent for his goals. In the island of [[Krakinowa]], Sunfire was caught in a conflict with [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] when one of the Dragon-Lord's prisoners made contact with Namor's ally, [[Betty Dean (Earth-616)|Betty Prentiss]]. Later, as Sunfire was sent to capture an American cargo ship, Namor intervened. However, Sunfire ultimately burned the ship down. As destruction ensued, Sunfire realized the ramifications of his actions and was convinced by Namor to team up with him to rescue the shipwrecked and defeat the Dragon-Lord. After the Dragon-Lord was defeated, Sunfire attempted to have a revenge against Namor, though he failed miserably.{{r|Sub-Mariner Vol 1 52|54}} They would clash again when [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and Namor battled in [[Osaka]] over a piece of the [[Evil Eye|Evil Eye]] during the [[Avengers/Defenders War|conflict between the Avengers and the Defenders]]. Sunfire interrupted them and took the Eye for himself feeling neither of them had the right to fight over it in his homeland. He held it for a moment before Namor knocked him out of the sky, causing it to fall into Captain America's hands.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 117}}

In order to regain his honor in Japan, Sunfire took it upon himself to advance Japan's reconstruction work in [[Vietnam]]. There, a Vietnamese Major proposed an agreement for him to eliminate [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] to gain top priority from his government, which was just a deception to off the golden avenger for his benefit. Sunfire gladly agreed, considering taking out the bodyguard of Tony Stark, whose [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|corporation]] rivaled those of Japan's. When Sunfire ambushed Iron Man and [[Roxanne Gilbert (Earth-616)|Roxie Gilbert]], the two heroes fought until Sunfire was suddenly teleported to the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]]'s underwater base. Mandarin, trapped in the [[Milos Masaryk (Earth-616)|Unicorn]]'s dying body, baited the trapped Sunfire into powering his Mind-Exchange Machine to return him and Unicorn to their proper bodies.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 68}} As Iron Man attacked the Mandarin's base, Sunfire realized the potential for his escape. However, the ensuing destruction of Iron Man and Mandarin's fight resulted in the base flooding, and Sunfire nearly drowned, only to be freed with Iron Man's assistance.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 69}} Later, Sunfire endeavored to defeat [[Ultimo (Earth-616)|Ultimo]], whom Mandarin summoned to take back [[Mandarin's Castle|his castle]] from the [[Plan Chu (Earth-616)|Yellow Claw]]. He had very little success, though, due to using up most of his solar power earlier in his escape. Sunfire tried to use his remaining solar power to fly away, but he wasn't fast enough and ended up in its grasp. Fortunately, Iron Man managed to free him once again, and they worked together again to trick the alien robot into burying itself under a mountain. As Sunfire parted ways with Iron Man, seeing him as an ally and reconsidering his views of America.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 70}}

===[[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]===
When most of the original X-Men were trapped by [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], Sunfire was one of the mutants recruited by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]] to rescue his original students. Though he had no interest in joining other mutants, Sunfire agreed by feeling honor bound and wishing to reintroduce himself as a warrior to the world. During the mission, Sunfire formed an assault team with [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]]. The rescue was a success{{r|Giant-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}} but, right after the mission, Sunfire left the team, alleging his loyalty lied with his country only and departing on bad terms with the X-Men.{{r|X-Men  Vol 1 94}}

Working to protect Japan's sacred honor in his views, Sunfire attacked [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]], claiming Tony Stark's interventionist approach in Japan was disgraceful since he allegedly bribed Japanese officials to perform his transactions. Stark went to protect his facilities, wearing the [[Guardsman Armor]], which prevented Sunfire to recognize him as Iron Man. The fight was interrupted by [[Michael O'Brien (Earth-616)|Michael O'Brien]], who wore the Iron Man suit. However, the Mandarin, seeking revenge for his last defeat, captured O'Brien with a teleportation device, believing him to be the real Iron Man.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 98}} When Stark returned to the fight, this time as Iron Man, he believed Sunfire had blasted O'Brien out of existence and a battle ensued. With the intervention of [[Jasper Sitwell (Earth-616)|Jasper Sitwell]] and [[Fujiko Watanabe (Earth-616)|Fujiko Watanabe]], Sunfire was knocked out.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 99}}

Sunfire and the X-Men met again when the latter, after becoming adrift following an incident in the [[Savage Land]], were rescued by the [[Jinguichi Maru]] ship's crew and docked at Agarashima. The city was devastated by a fire, a result of an earthquake. As the X-Men attempted to help, they were confronted by Sunfire, who led a team of combat troops and ordered their arrest. Sunfire was stopped by the [[Daughters of the Dragon (Earth-616)|Daughters of the Dragon]], the detectives [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]]. The groups settled at the Yoshida Manor, where they were surprised by another earthquake and attacked by mercenaries wearing [[Mandroid Armor|Mandroid Armors]]. After Sunfire and the X-Men defeated the villains, the architect behind the attacks was revealed to be [[Moses Magnum (Earth-616)|Moses Magnum]], who schemed to threaten the Japanese government into crowing him Emperor of Japan.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 118}} Sanctioned by the Prime Minister of Japan, Sunfire accompanied the X-Men in infiltrating Magnum's complex in the [[Kuril Islands]]. With [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]]'s effort, Magnum's base was destroyed and his plans foiled. Sunfire then signalled the Daughters of the Dragon to rescue the X-Men and welcome them back to his home during Christmas.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 119}} As the X-Men left, Sunfire for the first time declared he regarded the fellow mutants as friends.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 120}}

===Japan's super warrior===
Sunfire rose as Japan's greatest super-hero warrior, always operating for the Japanese government's best interests. When several heroes of Earth were abducted by the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] and [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]] to be part of the [[Contest of Champions]], Sunfire was part of the large group of players. Grandmaster battled Death over the right of restoring his brother, the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]] to life. Sunfire was recruited to be part of Death's first team of champions, who were tasked of assembling the [[Golden Globe of Life]].{{r|Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions Vol 1 1}} On the [[North Pole]], alongside [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Girl]] and [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], Sunfire was supposed to compete against [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], [[Laynia Petrovna (Earth-616)|Darkstar]] and [[Talisman (Australian) (Earth-616)|Talisman]]. However, he chose to act without his teammates' consent and search for the prize by himself and attacked Darkstar, causing a conflict between the two groups. When Daredevil claimed a piece of the globe, Sunfire's squad found their defeat.{{r|Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions Vol 1 2}} At the end of the contest, the heroes returned home.{{r|Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions Vol 1 3}}

When the X-Men returned to Earth coming from an adventure in the [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]], they emerged in the [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] with [[Puff (Earth-616)|giant dragon]] who had disrupted their teleport. As the dragon headed to [[Tokyo]] seeking to destroy it, the Japanese defenses forces, assisted by the lord of Yashida Clan, Sunfire's cousin [[Mariko Yashida (Earth-616)|Mariko]], sent Sunfire to help with the crisis. Sunfire joined forces with his allies, the X-Men, in combating the dragon, who was eventually convinced by [[Lockheed (Earth-616)|Lockheed]] to leave.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 181}}

As Japan's prime hero, Sunfire tried to keep his community free from menaces, like super-villains such as the [[Jackson Day (Earth-616)|Corruptor]], who believed Japan provided opportunities for his activities as a bank robber. As Shiro Yoshida, however, he maintained a humble disguise, by enrolling at the [[University of Tokyo]] as a student. When attending the inauguration of a new science building he had built for Tokyo university, Yoshida had the opportunity to encounter the funder of the building, [[Kishi Oramosha (Earth-616)|Dr. Kishi Oramosha]], as he discoursed to the crowd. Oramosha, much to Yoshida's disappointment, revealed himself to be an ultranationalist terrorist named Deadline and shared his plans of destroying major cities, using a solar-based device to force an international union against corporate exploitation of Earth. His first chosen target was Tokyo, a city with no super heroes. Enraged by this revelation, Yoshida came out as Sunfire and fought Deadline, hopelessly trying to destroy his machine. Being supported by his colleague, Erin, a French exchange student, Sunfire redirected the machine's energy using his powers, rendering it useless. With Deadline arrested, Tokyo was saved.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 32}}

Sunfire was eventually enlisted by by [[Character Index/Y#Yoritomo|Yoritomo]], a Japanese nationalist who had been Shiro's idol since he was a child. With Yoritomo by his side, Shiro Yoshida rose as a powerful businessmen, making deals with [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]] to acquire [[Cybertek (Earth-616)|Cybertek]] weaponry. After a transaction was made with [[Harlan Ryker (Earth-616)|Harlan Ryker]], Yoshida and Yoritomo discussed their plans of creating an army of super-agents to restore Japan's grandeur. However, a disagreement ensued between the two partners, as Yoshida wished to restore Japan's honor with a defensive task force and Yoritomo sought for revenge and power. Enraged, Yoritomo secretly attempted to murder Yoshida using [[Terminal Armor|Terminal Armors]], who had no chance against the power of Sunfire. Though Ryker was framed by Yoritomo, Sunfire learned the truth after being restrained by Ryker's unwilling bodyguard, [[Michael Collins (Earth-616)|Deathlok]]. With [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s assistance, the heroes joined forces to stop Yoritomo's plans of nuking [[Washington, D.C.]]{{r|Deathlok Vol 1 4}}

When an experimental drug, known as [[Sleet]], was introduced to the water supply of a small village in Japan, its inhabitants tragically perished in an act of chemical warfare. The Japanese government commissioned Sunfire to investigate, and the clues brought him to [[Madripoor]]. There, he contacted one of his father's respected friends, [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], whose investigation, similarly to Sunfire's, led him to reach the [[Mutant Liberation Front (Earth-616)|Mutant Liberation Front]]. Teaming up with Cable's [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]], Sunfire confronted some MLF's members and invaded their hideout. Sunfire and the New Mutants were captured by [[Nathaniel Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]], who confirmed the MLF was behind the production of Sleet, part of a plan to poison the major capital cities of the world.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 93}} As Sunfire and the New Mutants broke free, the MLF was fended off with the help of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], allowing Sunfire to incinerate the Sleet supply.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 94}}

===[[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] and [[Big Hero Six (Earth-616)|Big Hero Six]]===
When [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] disrupted Earth's magnetic field by unleashing a massive electromagnetic pulse, Sunfire was unprotectedly caught by the onslaught wave.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 25}} The experience caused him to uncontrollably release his atomic blazes upon Tokyo. Though no one was harmed by this incident, the Japanese government, fearing a potential nuclear disaster, reacted with extreme caution by imprisoning Sunfire. He was freed by his cousin, the new leader of the Clan Yashida, [[Keniuchio Harada (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]], with the assistance of Wolverine. Concurrently, [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]] saw an opportunity to carry out his [[Operation: Zero Tolerance (Event)|Operation: Zero Tolerance]] against mutants all over the globe, including Japan, convincing the Japanese government to reactivate the mechanoid [[SJ3RX (Earth-616)|Red Ronin]] as an anti-mutant asset. The Silver Samurai, a mutant himself, asked for Wolverine's and Sunfire's help in shutting the Red Ronin's installation down. After the Red Ronin was activated, Sunfire lost control of his powers one more time in order to escape from being crushed by the already deactivated robot. Wolverine managed to calm him down and suggested him to get support in [[Canada]], with [[Department H (Earth-616)|Department H]], since Sunfire's reputation was damaged by the Japanese media.{{r|Wolverine Annual Vol 1 1996}}

Now a man without a country, Sunfire arrived at Department H, where he was immediately identified and aprehended as an intruder.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 2 1}} As a prisoner, Sunfire was experimented on as part of the "Helios Project" run by [[Horatio Huxley (Earth-616)|Dr. Horatio Huxley]], who claimed Sunfire was afflicted by radiation poisoning.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 2 2}} Unexpectedly, Sunfire was rescued by [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] rookie members [[Jared Corbo (Earth-616)|Radius]], [[Arlette Truffaut (Earth-616)|Murmur]] and [[Adrian Corbo (Earth-616)|Flex]], who left Department H.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 2 3}} However, the band of runaways became victims of [[Mesmero (Vincent) (Earth-616)|Mesmero]]'s mental manipulation powers in a restaurant. Though Sunfire initially resisted Mesmero's control, he was ultimately forced to act as a cook for his restaurant. Although Murmur managed to break them all free from Mesmero, the other, more experienced, members of Alpha Flight were targeted instead.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 2 4}} As a battle ensued, Sunfire and Alpha Flight overpowered Mesmero, who managed to escape.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 2 5}}

As Sunfire worked with Alpha Flight, his condition worsened, evidenced by a dark spot developing on his abdomen.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 2 7}} Still subjected to Huxley's experiments, Sunfire's entire right half of his body was covered by the black splotch.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 2 8}} Since he found no help in Department H and Alpha Flight, Sunfire decided to return to Japan, even if it meant for him to be imprisoned.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 2 9}} Before leaving, he helped Alpha Flight to counter an invasion performed by the [[Zodiac (Ecliptic) (Earth-616)|Zodiac]].{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 2 12|13}}

Sunfire made a private return to Japan, settling in an abandoned ancient temple in the Quonon province, where he intented to await for his end in peace. However, his was located by [[Hiro Takachiho (Earth-616)|Hiro Takachiho]], a young genius who idolized Sunfire as a hero and tracked his bioatomic signature. Their reunion was interrupted by the Silver Samurai and his new super-hero group, the [[Big Hero Six (Earth-616)|Big Hero Six]], who wished to recruit both Sunfire and Hiro for the team. Sunfire refused, alleging his heroic days were over,{{r|Sunfire and Big Hero Six Vol 1 1}} but accepted help from Big Hero Six to assess his condition. However, Hiro's mother was kidnapped by the villain [[Everwraith (Earth-616)|Everwraith]], in an blackmailing attempt to have Sunfire. When Hiro approached Sunfire a second time, he found only a shadow of a hero and lost his hope for help.{{r|Sunfire and Big Hero Six Vol 1 2}} Hiro and the Big Hero Six attempted to stop Everwraith, in order to recue his mother and protect Tokyo. Sunfire decided to join the group as a hero and learned Everwraith wished to forge a stronger Japan by causing destruction. When Everwraith tampered with Sunfire's powers, Hiro suggested him to release it as a way to control it, assuming a bio-kinetic charge had been introduced to his organism, causing conflicts with his solar-based powers. The action caused Everwraith's defeat, apparently at the cost of Sunfire's life. However, Hiro once again met him, as he was sure his hero had survived. As Sunfire departed back to Canada to investigate his condition, Hiro shared Sunfire had not only a fan but also a friend.{{r|Sunfire and Big Hero Six Vol 1 3}}

===[[Apocalypse: The Twelve|The Twelve]]===
Sunfire was named as one of the mythical "[[Twelve (Mutants) (Earth-616)|Twelve]]" by [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]], representing the power of nature along with [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] and [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 #377}}

During this time, Prof. Charles Xavier was kidnapped by Magneto, who threatened to start a third World War. [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey-Summers]] called Sunfire in hopes that he would once again answer the call to join them, but he was still recuperating and sent his sister, [[Leyu Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunpyre]] who had very similar powers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 #392}}

After being exposed to "Zero Fluid," Sunfire began having problems with his power. The [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus Project]] falsely told him his powers and the fluid had formed cancer throughout his body and that he would have had to serve them for the necessary treatments. After refusing, Sunfire was shot by [[Kyle Gibney (Earth-616)|Wild Child]] and was thought dead, though he managed to survive.{{r|Weapon X: The Draft - Wild Child Vol 1 #1}}

With a new outlook on life after his near death experience, Sunfire looked at things differently, re-joining the X-Men after they went global.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 #133}}

===Blindspot===
It was then publicly leaked that Sunfire and his uncle had dealings with [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], [[Blindspot (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Blindspot]], and [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] back in the day. They plotted to steal the plans for the [[Adamantium]] bonding process. Tomo wanted to form "an army of invincible samurai" with this process, and the Brotherhood would have received a substantial amount of money. The plot failed and Blindspot removed the memories of all involved as well as [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]]. Deathstrike's cybernetics enabled her to find the missing memory. Silver Samurai was reverted to being a criminal by Blindspot. Rogue contacted Shiro and the two sought to learn the truth. The Silver Samurai fled after being absorbed by Rogue.{{r| Rogue Vol 3 #7|9}}

During a battle with Deathstrike, Sunfire's powers triggered the sprinkler system, filling the room with steam. Lady Deathstrike moved behind him and severed his legs from his body. {{r|Rogue Vol 3 10}} 
While prisoners to Deathstrike, he told Rogue to absorb his powers so she could fight her. She agreed, but only a momentary touch so as not to strain his condition. Blindspot then pushed Rogue onto Sunfire, and she absorbed his memories as well as powers. Shiro was presumed to be dead, although the X-Men were unable to find his body.{{r|Rogue Vol 3 #11|12}}

===Horseman of Apocalypse===
In actuality, Shiro was taken to a hospital and kept under watchful guard by members of Clan Yoshida and the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] who were trying to convince him to accept prosthetic limbs. Shiro however was suicidal, and asked only for a sword so that he could end his misery. He then received a visit from the newly resurrected Apocalypse who gave him an enticing offer to join him in saving mutantkind, in return for which Apocalypse would restore his powers and his lost limbs. Shiro agreed.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #182}}

During the process of being transformed into the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horseman]] [[Famine]], Shiro's heroic side returned and he knew what he was doing was wrong. He struggled with his choice and thought about escaping, but he did not want to leave the mutant [[Gazer (Earth-616)|Gazer]] to suffer, who was also being turned into a Horseman. Shiro finally decided that he couldn't let Gazer suffer more and tried to save him, but he was too late and they were both turned into horsemen of Apocalypse.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #182}}

During his time as Famine, Shiro attacked the X-Men, using his flares to give their eyes and brain imagery that made them feel like they were starving. During the X-Men's battle with Apocalypse, Gazer as [[War]] was killed while [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] as [[Death]] and [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] as [[Pestilence]] were captured. Despite Apocalypse being defeated and having escaped, Shiro was still under his mental control and tried to save his former horsemen from the X-Men. While Polaris was able to refuse Shiro's offer, Gambit went with him. Shiro tried to use his fire to cleanse Gambit of the ways of the X-Men as he was having doubts about Apocalypse, but during their training they were approached by [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Sinister]] who was building a mutant army to find [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny's]] [[Destiny's Books|diaries]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #183|187}}

===Marauders===
Under Sinister's guidance, Gambit and Shiro were re-brainwashed, and cleansed from a lot of the damage done by Apocalypse, with only enough still standing that they would work for him. During his time as a [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauder]], Shiro attacked [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] alongside Gambit and left under the impression that they had successfully murdered him.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #200}}{{r| Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 #42}} He fought against the X-Men on numerous occasions,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #201|205}} and joined the Marauders in killing the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] when they went after the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|first mutant baby]] born after [[M-Day]], an act Shiro took a lot of pleasure in.{{r|X-Men: Messiah Complex Vol 1 #1}}

During the final battle to get the baby on [[Muir Island]], Sunfire was knocked out while most of the other Marauders died or escaped. He was last seen unconscious when [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] used his flame powers to close up his wounds before going after Cable and the baby. When he awoke, he saw that the battle was over, Sinister dead, and the Marauders disbanded. Lost and facing an identity crisis, Shiro gave up his Sunfire identity and wandered for a year in a drunk haze.{{r| X-Men Vol 2 #207}}

===Uncanny Avengers===
Shiro eventually found himself back in Japan where [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] found him and recruited him to be a part of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Squad]]. However, Shiro regarded himself as disgraced and no longer a superhero. Wolverine told him what the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] had done to Charles Xavier, which prompted Shiro to accept.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 5}}

Shiro later assisted Rogue in fighting off the [[Eric Williams (Earth-616)|Grim Reaper]], which ended with her killing him. He then joined Captain America on a trip to the [[Peak VII|Peak]] to review footage of the [[Apocalypse Twins (Earth-616)|Apocalypse Twins]], who appeared and attacked the Peak. Shiro wanted to stay and fight, but Captain America convinced him otherwise; when Captain America's escape pod wouldn't open. Shiro sacrificed his pod to save Captain America. As the escape pods drifted away, the Twins' ship blasted the Peak in half. Shiro fell to Earth, but managed to survive.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 7|8}}

While destroying a huge chunk of debris that threatened to destroy a city, he met up with Thor, who also came to destroy the debris. They traveled to an old Apocalypse base and found a recording which revealed that Wolverine and his X-force killed the child Apocalypse and then later [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Dark Angel]], the twins' father.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 9}}

Shiro joined Wolverine in the team's dispute alongside Thor and Rogue. He later found Wolverine, after he had been crucified by Daken. Sunfire later learned of [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch's]] betrayal of the team, and paired up with Rogue to stop her from calling the mutants to the Twins' ship. He would ultimately fail, and was last seen in a pod next to Wolverine, deep in a cryo-sleep.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 10|15}}

Following a confrontation with the [[Celestial]] [[Exitar (Earth-616)|Exitar]], who had come to judge Earth due to the machinations of the Apocalypse Twins, Sunfire was apparently killed by [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Beforehand, however, he used his power to transform his body into a state of pure energy that could absorb most of the Celestials' energy.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #22}}

===AXIS===
Months later, Sunfire and the Unity Squad traveled to the island of [[Genosha]] to aid the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], [[X-Men (Earth-616)|Storm's X-Men]], and [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|Cyclops' X-Men]] in the fight against Red Skull, who had become Red Onslaught and was causing havoc all over the world with his tremendous telepathic power. Onslaught eventually deployed two [[Stark Sentinels]], a model of Sentinel programmed with knowledge of different superheroes that allowed them to turn the heroes' strengths against them.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 1}} Sunfire was captured along with the other heroes and stored within one of the Stark Sentinels after being shrunk using [[Pym Particles]].{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 2}}

Sunfire and the other heroes were freed when Magneto led a [[Astonishing Avengers (Earth-616)|team of super-villains]] against the Stark Sentinels. Scarlet Witch and [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] then defeated Red Onslaught by casting an inversion spell to force a fragment of Charles Xavier's psyche trapped within Red Onslaught to emerge and knock Onslaught out.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 3}}

It was later discovered that the inversion spell had inadvertently caused most of the heroes to become evil, including Sunfire. Sunfire joined the X-Men at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]] to declare the unification of mutants and to reveal their new agenda of no longer wanting coexistence between humans and mutants. The heroes wanted to stand above them, with the help of [[Evan Sabahnur (Earth-616)|Evan Sabahnur]], who had become Apocalypse due to the inversion spell.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 4}}

Led by the new Apocalypse, Sunfire was among the X-Men who appeared above New York City and proclaimed their intent to conquer Manhattan, issuing an ultimatum that all humans be evacuated within three hours or perish.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 5}} They also broadcast a warning for [[Homo sapiens|humankind]] and revealed that they had created a gene bomb designed to kill everyone on Earth that didn't have the X-gene in their body.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 6}}

Sunfire and the X-Men got into a fight with the [[Astonishing Avengers (Earth-616)|Astonishing Avengers]] formed from Magneto's team of supervillains that had been inverted on Genosha. The X-Men defeated them,{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 7}} but an inverted [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]] sacrificed himself to prevent the X-Men's gene bomb from killing all non-mutants.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 8}} Later, the [[Axis (Earth-616)|inverted Avengers]] attacked the X-Men. In the ensuing battle, an inverted Doctor Doom and Scarlet Witch, possessed by the spirit of [[Daniel Drumm (Earth-616)|Daniel Drumm]], cast another inversion spell that returned almost returned every hero and villain to normal, including Sunfire.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 9}} After the incident, Sunfire chose not to return to the Avengers Unity Squad.

===Weirdworld===
After Cyclops started a revolution in Washington, D.C., Sunfire sided with him. They came into conflict with the Inhumans, and something terrible happened that resulted in Cyclops' death. Sunfire was later seen with some other mutant refugees on [[Weirdworld (Battleworld)|Weirdworld]] when the X-Men arrived.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 6}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Shiro was one of the many mutants that opposed the crazed [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] from remaking the world in his image. When X-Man realized that his vision of the world would never come about with the X-Men around, X-Man made his enemies vanish in an instant, including Shiro.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9|10}}

===Age of X-Man===
Shiro and the other mutants were transported to a [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|different reality]] created by X-Man and a [[Life Seed]], a world where everyone on Earth was a mutant and familial and romantic relationships were strongly discouraged or illegal. Sunfire became a Civil Management instructor at the Summers Institute for Higher Learning in [[Westchester County]]. Like its mainstream reality counterpart, [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], the Summers Institute taught mutant children how to control their mutant abilities. [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Dean Angel]] showed new arrival, [[Luna (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Luna]], the classroom where Shiro was seen teaching his students how to keep and manage the peace.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 1}}

Mr. Yoshida was later seen telling everyone about embarking on the mentorship program with [[Department X (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Department X]] clerks. They had a special guest from the department, [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]], who shared with the students on the daily routine of the clerks.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 1}}

Fearing the threat of the mutant drug Unveil and its impact on her friends, [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] interrupted a meeting between Sunfire and Dean Angel to express her concerns about [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]] and [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]]. Warren immediately called in [[Department X (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Department X]] to deal with the issue. [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]] and [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] arrived to investigate and were let into Anole's room by Warren and Sunfire.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 4}}

Although not shown on panel, it can be assumed that Sunfire returned to the mainstream reality with the rest of the trapped mutants through Nate Grey's portals.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

===X-Men===
During the [[Hellfire Gala|Hellfire Gala]] Sunfire was elected to the X-Men team.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 21}} and moved to a [[Treehouse]] in Central Park.{{r|X-Men Vol 6 1}}

After forming this team fought off two alien attacks, one by the [[Mind Reaver (Earth-616)|Mind Reaver]] in Manhattan, the other by the Annihilation Wave in Kansas. This was the work of the intergalactic crime lord [[Cordyceps Jones (Earth-616)|Cordyceps Jones]] who had been running bets on who could destroy the Earth first on his casino [[Gameworld]].{{r|X-Men Vol 6 1|2}}

|Powers                  = Sunfire is an '''Alpha-[[Homo superior|mutant]]''':{{r|X-Men Vol 2 97}}

'''Solar Radiation Manipulation''': Shiro's mutant powers enable him to absorb solar and other radiation to generate the process of ionized matter (usually air) through a mentally-triggered unknown biochemical process so that it is converted to plasma, the superheated state of matter. Plasma is the state in which matter making up the sun exists; hence, Sunfire refers to his projecting "solar fire". Hence he can sheath his body in flame.
*'''''Flight''''': He can use his powers to create super-heated air currents which push him forward through the air, enabling him to fly. Sometimes this super-heated air is visible as a trail of flame behind Sunfire. The upper limit to the speed Sunfire can achieve in flight is not yet known, although it is known to be greater than that of the Angel, who can reach 150 miles per hour. 
*'''''Plasma Blasts''''': He has the ability to project the flames he generates as powerful blasts of energy.
*'''''Plasma Emanation''''': Sunfire can generate plasma temperatures which match those that can be generated by the Human Torch, reaching about 1,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit at maximum level. He can also use his power in a massive blast similar to Johnny Storm's "Nova Burst". However, Shiro has much more control over the area of effect, enough to where one person may feel like they have been sunbathing all day to total incineration of another target.
*'''''Heat Signature Sense''''': He has the ability to sense beings by the heat signature that they give off.
*'''''Plasma Shield''''': He has the ability to manipulate the plasma around him to form an aura that can melt incoming bullets or stave off other attacks.

'''Solar Shielding Psi-field''': He is protected from the heat and radiation he emits by a short-range psionic force field which automatically comes into being whenever there is air friction, and also prevents excessive amounts of light from the plasma from reaching his eyes so as to blind or damage them. Sunfire's body emits a protective field whenever he uses his powers. However, it is speculated that he can generate power in excess of his natural protection.<br>

He has also retained some abilities from [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]]'s enhancement:
*'''Bio-Oxygen Generation''': When Sunfire was transformed into the Horseman of Famine, he was given the ability to produce oxygen, allowing him to maintain his flames and breathe in areas lacking oxygen, like deep space.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #8}}

{{Navigation
	
| title = Former Powers
	
| body ====='''[[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horsemen of Apocalypse]]'''====
As the Horsemen of Famine, Sunfire was capable of:
*'''Solar Hunger''': He has ability to manipulate the light patterns he generated to stimulate the optic nerve and make the brain believe the body is starving.

===='''Zero Fluid'''====
Shiro was once exposed to the ''Zero Fluid'' that powers [[Jack of Hearts (Jonathan Hart)]], his right side becoming blackish like Jack's. While the fluid was active his physical stats increased and he was able to discharge "bio-energy" in addition to his plasma. His body eventually rid itself of the fluid's properties and he returned to normal.}}

| Abilities               = '''Martial Artist:''' Sunfire is trained in karate, Japanese Samurai swordsmanship, and kendo.{{r|The Marvel Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the Marvel Universe (2006)}}
| Strength                = Normal human male with moderate regular exercise. Since his transformation into Famine, Shiro's strength is unknown.

| Notes                   = *Although Shiro never seemed to officially accept [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Xavier's]] invitation of X-Men membership, he is considered a member because he did agree to help in the very important mission in {{cl|Giant-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}}. Many years later, he unequivocally became an X-Man in {{cl|X-Men Vol 5 21}}.
*Both "Yoshida" and "Yashida" seem to be correct spellings of his surname; however, while the word is plausible in the Japanese romanization system, "Yashida" as a family name does not exist.
*When he was Famine his costume looked similar to that of his Earth-295/Age of Apocalypse counterpart. 
*According to the narration of [[Alpha Flight Vol 2 7]] (February, 1998), Sunfire's grandfather was in [[Nagasaki]] during [[World War II]]. When the atomic bomb fell in the city, the grandfather was exposed to the radiation. He died of radiation poisoning. {{r|Alpha Flight Vol 2 7}}
