===Early Years===
====Avalon====
Allegedly, islands remained of [[Atlantis (Empire)|Atlantis]] after it sank. On the largest of those islands, [[Avalon (Atlantis)|Avalon]], [[Igraine (Earth-616)|Igraine]] was a sea-princess. Igraine had a daughter named Morgan with a man from the [[Sacred Clan (Earth-616)|sacred clan]].<!-- {{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #62|; Beware the Tides of March}} -->

As the custom went, Morgan was taken to be trained at the [[House of Virgins]] to serve as Avalon's sea-princess, the great sun temple of the [[Crystal City (Ruta)|Crystal City]] of the volcanic island of [[Ruta]]. The women were given in marriage to men of the sacred clan for magical purposes, forbidding Morgan the love she sought.<!-- {{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #62|; Beware the Tides of March}} -->

A young priest, [[Merlyn (Otherworld)|Myraddin]] was warned of the upcoming and long foretold [[Post-Hyborian Cataclysm|catastrophe]] that was going to occur. The ancient priest of the sun entrusted Myraddin with his secret scrolls, and with his daughter Igraine. Myraddin and Igraine rushed to the House of Virgins where they took Morgan, and flew on a merchant ship from [[Tingail]], while the remaining islands of Atlantis were drowned by great tidal waves caused by the burst of the volcano.{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #62|; Beware the Tides of March}}

====Britain====
They ended up on the Isle of [[Britain]], where Myraddin changed his name to Merlin and established his druid worship in [[Stonehenge (Location)|Stonehenge]]. He arranged for Igraine to marry [[Gorlois (Earth-616)|Gorlois]], Duke of the [[Tin Islands]], who adopted Morgan. Gorlois was killed by [[Uther Pendragon (Earth-616)|Uther Pendragon]], who took Igraine for queen. She birthed a son, [[Arthur Pendragon (Earth-616)|Arthur]].<!-- {{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #62|; Beware the Tides of March}} -->

Growing into a fine young woman, Morgan followed Merlin to [[Aran Island]] to become his apprentice, in exchange to also becoming his lover, but failed to her pledge.{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #62|; Beware the Tides of March}}

Protesting the conversion of Great Britain to Pauline [[Christianity]], Morgan opposed her half-brother, [[Arthur Pendragon (Earth-616)|King Arthur Pendragon]] of [[Camelot]]. To this end, Morgan attempted to used the [[Darkhold]] and was possessed by [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]].{{citation}}

Later, when Merlin and the [[Percival of Scandia (Earth-616)|Black Knight]] went off to battle Morgan, a mutated [[Glossary:Nordheimr|Nordheimr]] [[Vanir (Nordheimr)|Vanir]] [[Maha Yogi (Earth-616)|impersonated Merlin]], and [[Sir Percival (Earth-616)|Sir Percival]] was slain by [[Mordred (Earth-616)|Mordred]].{{citation}}

Merlin thwarted numerous attempts to bring ruin to Camelot, and eventually imprisoned her within [[Castle Le Fey]].<!-- {{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #62|; Beware the Tides of March}} -->

Morgan kept projecting her [[astral form]] into various periods of the future, seeking a means to escape her physical prison.{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #62|; Beware the Tides of March}}

===[[Modern Age]]===
In modern times, Morgan's astral form battled [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]]{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #62|; Beware the Tides of March}}<!-- remove if the flashback is from a clash with the Avengers (and not Spider-Woman only) --> and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{citation}}

She briefly altered the world to her [[Earth-398|own twisted version]] with the team serving as her [[Queen's Vengeance (Earth-398)|Queen's Vengeance]].{{citation}}

[[File:Dark Avengers (Earth-616) vs. Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616) from Dark Avengers Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Morgana forcing the Dark Avengers into retreat]]
====Doctor Doom====
[[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] traveled back in time to ask for her help in defeating the [[Mighty Avengers (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]]. During his many visits, they became lovers. She taught him magic but asked for a gift from the future. Doom claimed he couldn't, as it would cause disruption to the timeline. However, Doom did not consider their affair disruptive, as it was contained. Doom asked Morgan to tutor him further in the dark arts, including summoning an army of demons he used successfully to take down the Mighty Avengers.{{r|Mighty Avengers #9}}

Morgan traveled into the future with an army of demons to avenge Doom's betrayal.{{r|Dark Avengers #1}} At first, she attempted to kill Doom when he was a child, but then decided to go ahead several decades, so that Doom would fully know why she was going to kill him, and engaged Doom in [[Latveria]]. When the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]] arrived to rescue Doom, the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] tore off her head. She subsequently violently reappeared in his place and took control over the new [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Spider-Man (Mac Gargan)]], who attacked [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]].{{r|Dark Avengers #2}} She was killed again by the new [[Bullseye (Earth-616)|Hawkeye (Bullseye)]], but she reappeared again. Morgan turned Ares into stone, while Doom and [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Iron Patriot]] traveled back in time to kill her in her own time.{{r|Dark Avengers #3}} There, Doom chanted a spell of a language that even she possessed no knowledge of to forcibly send the sorceress into her own enchanted cauldron, despite her screams and pleas. Though Morgan lived, she was sent to 1,000,000 BC where she ran from a tribe of cavemen fighting a [[Tyrannosaurus rex|T-Rex]]. Doom magically restored Latveria, and the revived Dark Avengers headed back to America.{{r|Dark Avengers #4}}

[[File:Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616) from Avengers World Vol 1 12 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Morgan, Queen of the World]]
====Avengers World====
After having been freed by her daughter [[Caroline Le Fay (Earth-616)|Caroline Le Fay]] from her own magic cauldron that Doom trapped her in,{{r|Fearless Defenders #12}} Morgan Le Fay took over a [[City of the Dead]] underneath [[Velletri]], [[Italy]], a mystical necropolis of which there are many below European cities.{{r|Avengers World #1}} From here she launched a massive attack with armies of the dead all over Europe.{{r|Avengers World #10}}

The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and the [[Euroforce (Earth-616)|Euroforce]] joined forces to take her down, but they were easily overpowered by the hordes of the dead.{{r|Avengers World #11}} [[Sebastian Druid (Earth-616)|Sebastian Druid]] tried to aid the heroes, but he was killed by le Fay shortly after arriving at the city.{{r|Avengers World #12}} However, killing Druid worked out against Morgan's plans. He became a ghost of the city which, being one of them, allowed his magic to work, pulling back the armies back to their respective necropolises, severely weakening le Fay. The Avengers and the Euroforce proceeded to beat her up, forcing her to retreat.{{r|Avengers World #14}}

====Excalibur====
When [[Flowers of Krakoa]] grew on [[Otherworld]] to form a [[Gateways|Gateway]] to [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], it infected [[Camelot]], causing its queen, Morgan Le Fay to find a way to destroy it, as there have been already enough damage from the attacks of the [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|White Witch]]. In order to achieve this, she needed to terminate the "[[Homo superior|Witchbreed]]", who were responsible for this. After [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Brian Braddock]] and his twin sister, [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Betsy Braddock]] came to fix the Gateway, le Fay apprehended them and took control of Brian, making him to turn on his sister. However, he managed to give to Betsy his [[Amulet of Right|amulet]], which allowed her to escape. Morgan then allied with the [[Coven Akkaba (Earth-616)|Coven Akkaba]] in order to deal with the Witchbreed.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 1|3}} During her attack, [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] challenged Morgan in a battle between their knights, Betsy and Brian Braddock for the throne of Avalon. Betsy involuntarily defeated her brother, which allowed Apocalypse to name [[James Braddock Jr. (Earth-616)|Jamie Braddock]] the new king of Avalon and imprisoned le Fay. Afterwards, Apocalypse began studying her body in order to proceed with a ritual.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 5|6}} She was eventually freed from her confinement by her Coven using a magic ritual involving [[Peter Wisdom (Earth-616)|Pete Wisdom]]'s blood, and she escaped through the gate to [[Braddock Lighthouse]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 21}}

====Mother Morgan Comes to Me====
Morgan resurfaced in the present with her powers greatly diminished, now living in Queens, at a time when Doom had been blamed for the destruction of a CO<sub>2</sub> waste conversion station, the Antlion Project, on the dark side of the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]]. Doom told her about glimpses of a future he was recurrently seeing, so Morgan decided to take him to meet the [[Witness (Prophet) (Earth-616)|Witness]]. The meeting was cut short when [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] sniped Victor in the head, instantly killing him in front of her.{{r|Doctor Doom #2}}

| Powers                  = Morgana possesses a gifted intellect, and as a former pupil of [[Merlin (Earth-616)|Merlin]], she knows a great deal of magical lore, considered one of the greatest sorceresses in Earth's history. To prove this, the Eye of Agamotto appeared to Morgan as it considered her as a possible replacement for Doctor Strange as Sorcerer Supreme.{{r|New Avengers #53}}
She is also a sea-priestess,{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #62|; Beware the Tides of March}} and a high priestess of the Earth goddess ([[Gaea (Earth-616)|Gaea]]), invoking her Celtic name, Danu.{{citation}}
*'''Spell Casting:''' Morgana is a very powerful sorceress capable of casting prodigious spells. Morgana once cast a spell that resurrected the entire sunken continent of Atlantis, killing the vast majority of its water-breathing inhabitants in the process.{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #62}}{{r|Fantastic Four: Atlantis Rising #1}} Morgana can cast location spells. She once cast a spell to locate Doom to see where he was hidden through time and space. She used this same spell to watch him in the modern day from her location in medieval times.{{r|Dark Avengers #1}} Morgana can cast spells to control her enemies. She cast a spell to enslave Thor into doing whatever she asked.{{r|Fantastic Four: Atlantis Rising #1}} And she also cast a spell to take control of Spider-Man's symbiote form to attack his teammates.{{r|Dark Avengers #2}} Again proving her power, Morgana cast a spell to trap the Elder god [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]] within Mount Wundagore, where he remained for centuries until he was able to use the Scarlet Witch in the modern day to escape.{{r|Avengers #187}} Morgan has used the ''[[Crimson Bands of Cyttorak]]'' to bind Doctor Strange and Balor, proving her capabilities of manipulating extra-dimensional mystical energies from the [[Octessence]] if needed.{{citation}}
*'''Reality Warping:''' Morgana once cast a very powerful spell to warp all of reality in her image by harnessing the [[Norn Stones]]. She was able to do this because of her own link to the Asgardians since she is half-Faerie, the same race as the Dark Elves. She also used the [[Twilight Sword (Surtur)|Twilight Sword]] in this effort. However, she required the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] to bridge the gap between her own magic and the sword itself.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 1}} Morgana once again cast a spell to warp all of reality around the globe by just using the masculine energies of [[Mordred (Earth-616)|Mordred]]. However, the spell was foiled by the Black Knight. This brings into question the necessity of the Norn Stones, the Twilight Sword, and the Scarlet Witch in her previous effort.{{r|Black Knight Vol 2 4}}
*'''Time Travel:''' Morgana was very skilled in magical time travel. It was one of her most frequently used magics. She once traveled back in time to kill Doom as a child but didn't, having decided that she wanted him to know why she was going to kill him instead.{{r|Dark Avengers #2}} Morgana used time travel to transport her entire army of monsters from medieval times to the modern day.{{r|Dark Avengers #3}} Morgan's skill at time travel is sufficient for her to remain ongoing enemies with opponents centuries apart. She can manipulate the rules of time travel to repeatedly undo her own death and return unaffected to the same battle.{{r|Dark Avengers #2|3}}
*'''Necromancy:''' Morgana was very powerful in necromancy, so much so that Doom actually traveled back in time in order to learn from her how to create an army of monsters, something she frequently did.{{r|Mighty Avengers #9}} Morgana also cast a spell to re-animate every person killed by the sword Excalibur by using a shard of the sword itself in an effort to create an army of the dead.{{r|Iron Man #150}} Morgana also used necromancy to unleash a global-sized army of the dead all over Europe by utilizing the hidden cities of the dead.{{r|Avengers World #10}} Morgana once used necromancy to create an entire army of monsters that she unleashed upon the Dark Avengers. She also transported this army through time and space from medieval times to the modern day to fight her enemies.{{r|Dark Avengers #3}}
*'''Resurrection:''' Morgan has proven capable of surviving the death of her physical body.{{r|Spider-Woman #50}} Morgan can possess the bodies of women and, over time, reform them into perfect duplicates of her original.{{r|Iron Man #209}}{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #60|62}} As a result, she can be perpetually reincarnated so long as her spirit survives. Her spirit can exist independently of any host, apparently for centuries and with little loss of power.{{r|Avengers #241}}
*'''Power Granting:''' Morgana has demonstrated the ability to grant powers to others. She once enchanted a stone petal from the [[Ebon Rose]] and told [[Ian McNee (Earth-616)|Ian Mcknee]] to swallow it. She told him that the petal would allow him to speak with Gaea's children, both flora and fauna, giving him control over them.{{r|Mystic Arcana Scarlet Witch #1}} She also granted Ian all of her powers for a period of time to help him use the cornerstones of creation.{{r|Mystic Arcana Sister Grimm #1}}
*'''Flight'''{{r|Dark Avengers #3}}
*'''Teleportation:''' Morgana was capable of teleporting across great distances.{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #62}}{{r|Fantastic Four: Atlantis Rising #1}} She has also demonstrated an ability to teleport entire armies and to relocate her entire castle into another dimension. She once used teleportation to kill the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] by literally teleporting into his physical form and causing him to explode.{{r|Dark Avengers #2}} 
*'''Omnipresence:''' Morgana has demonstrated an ability to be everywhere at once. In the pages of Avengers World, she unleashed an army of the dead all over Europe. She proceeded to watch that same army by projecting her image into the skies, watching over the various cities and speaking down to the public regarding her take over.{{r|Avengers World #10}}{{r|Avengers World #11}}
*'''Shape Shifting:''' Morgana has demonstrated an ability to change her shape and form. She has on occasion used magic to grow in size to assume a giant version of herself.{{r|Avengers World #11}}{{r|Avengers #241}} She has also assumed different forms altogether, including a dragon.{{citation}}
*'''Transmutation:''' Morgana has demonstrated the power to transform one thing into another. She once cast a spell that turned various suits of armor into a monstrous creature to attack the Black Knight.{{r|Black Knight Vol 2 1}} Morgana once cast a spell to turn normal trees into monstrous ones and sent them to fight Ian McKnee.{{r|Mystic Arcana Black Knight #1}} Morgana turned Ares to stone when she battled the Dark Avengers.{{r|Dark Avengers #3}}
*'''Energy Projection:''' Morgana is able to her magical energy in the form of bolts, beams and various others when battling, has on several occasions proved devastating. When she battled Doom in a magical fight, her energy projection proved far too strong for him and she left him completely comatose for a period of time until he was able to get help from the Dark Avengers.{{r|Dark Avengers #1}}
*'''Illusions:''' Morgana has demonstrated the power to create illusions. Not only this, but she actually sent her illusions through time and space to 'haunt' Spider-Woman in the present day.{{r|Spider-Woman #50}}
*'''Astral Projection:''' Morgan has frequently displayed the ability to project herself in astral form. While in astral form, she has also been able to utilize her entire array of magical powers. She has also been able to bring others into an astral plane of existence too and battle them there. She can also affect physical beings and objects while in astral form.{{r|Avengers #241}}
