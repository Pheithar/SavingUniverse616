| History                 = A thousand or so years ago Spite fought her brother D'Spayre.  After losing she was banished to the Crimson Cosmos.  She eventually became a servant of Cyttorak while there.  She remained trapped there until [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] was sent to the Crimson Cosmos by [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]].  Cyttorak told her to bring Juggernaut to him so that he could possess his body, then the two of them would leave the Crimson Cosmos.  But Spite apparently betrayed him and was seemingly eaten by Cyttorak.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 12}}

She later showed up in New Mexico where she talked Juggernaut into helping her fight D'Spayre.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 1 1}}
