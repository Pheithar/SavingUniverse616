| History                 = When [[United States of America|American]] businessman [[Howard Stark (Earth-616)|Howard Stark]] formed the paramilitary espionage organization known as [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]],<ref>Although it was originally stated that Howard's adopted son [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] founded S.H.I.E.L.D. in {{cl|Strange Tales #135}}, now it has been retconned into being Howard Stark as per the [[Glossary:Sliding Timescale|Sliding Timescale]] of [[Earth-616]]. Howard Stark has been active as S.H.I.E.L.D. Chairman from its foundation, which is set between 1958 and 1961, until his death in a car accident set up by rival company [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Republic Oil & Gas]], happened twenty years before the present day according to ''[[International Iron Man Vol 1|International Iron Man]]'' series.</ref> former [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Army]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|C.I.A.]] Colonel Rick Stoner was appointed as the espionage agency's first public Executive Director.{{r|Secret Warriors #1|; S.H.I.E.L.D. Timeline}}

In 1965,<ref>{{cl|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 9}}'s second story reports that [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum Dum Dugan]] joined S.H.I.E.L.D. in 1965 on the behalf of the organization's newest Executive Director, longtime friend and former head of [[Howling Commandos (Earth-616)|Howling Commandos]] in [[World War II]], [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]. </ref> Rick Stoner was reported to have been killed by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] operatives during a mission.{{r|Secret Warriors #1|; S.H.I.E.L.D. Timeline}} Years later, however, Stoner's replacement as Executive Director, [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]],{{r|Strange Tales #135}}{{r|Secret Warriors #1|; S.H.I.E.L.D. Timeline}} discovered that his predecessor never actually died, but was instead left for dead and abandoned by S.H.I.E.L.D.; seeking revenge on the espionage organization, Stoner, under the codename Fallen Angel, led Fury to a project based on [[Cosmic Cube]] power capable of creating a pocket reality accessible only to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Director. Both Fury and Fallen Angel fell through the portal opened to the Cosmic Cube's fabricated world, but Stoner died during the conflict.{{r|Fury / Agent 13 #1|2}}

===Continuity Notes===
* Rick Stoner first appeared in {{cl|Fury #1}}, a special one-shot published in March 1994 with the purpose of clarifying the complex and messed up S.H.I.E.L.D. history; in such issue, Stoner was revealed to have been a superior of Nick Fury in the United States Army during [[World War II]], as well as a ranking C.I.A. operative who worked alongside Canadian Special Services agent [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]] in at least a circumstance, ultimately ending up being assassinated by Hydra agents. However, since the events of that one-shot have become outdated and unconciliable with the [[Glossary:Sliding Timescale|Sliding Timescale]] of [[Earth-616]], Stoner's appearance has to be considered apochryphal.
