===Origin===
Lord Deathstrike was the son [[Kenji Oyama (Earth-616)|Kenji Oyama]], a.k.a [[Lord Dark Wind]] and the brother of [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Yuriko Oyama]], a.k.a [[Lady Deathstrike]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 304}} After the death of his father, he became a professional assassin.

Years later he was hired by the [[Red Right Hand (Earth-616)|Red Right Hand]] to kill [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], but despite his incredible skills and technology he failed, as Mystique was killed by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 9}} 

===Joining Sabretooth's army===
Soon after he was hired to kill the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]]'s leader [[Azuma Gōda (Earth-616)|Azuma Gōda]], but after successfully shooting him in the head, he discovered that Mystique, who was resurrected by the Hand, impersonated Gōda in order to face him as revenge for almost killing her previously.

After a brief fight, Mystique revealed to him her true intentions and asked him if he was interested into working for the soon to be invisible King of Asia, [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]], which he accepted.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 303}} After facing the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]],{{r|X-Men Vol 3 26}} he was reunited with his sister and they were both invited alongside several other villains to [[Lowtown (Madripoor)|Lowtown]], [[Madripoor]], where Sabretooth held a party to celebrate his rise to the top of the Asian criminal empire. But Wolverine heard about it and decided to crash the party, defeating Lord Deathstrike and every other villain present before wishing an "happy birthday" to Sabretooth as revenge for what he did to him in the past.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 304}}

Some time later, Lord Deathstrike was seen as an instructor at the [[Hellfire Academy (Earth-616)|Hellfire Academy]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 20}} and fought against Wolverine once more.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 32}} He then tried to kill [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Venom]] and [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Mania]] after the criminal mobster [[Lord Ogre (Earth-616)|Lord Ogre]] put a price on their heads,{{r|Venom Vol 2 37|39}} before rejoining Sabretooth's organization as Sabretooth was about to strike Wolverine after hearing he lost his healing factor. After luring Wolverine to [[Howlett Estate|the place he was born]], Sabretooth used his ninja army, Mystique, Lord Deathstrike, and the [[Shingen Harada II (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]] to break Logan. Once done, Sabretooth appeared and beat Wolverine to a pulp and left him broken, both physically and mentally.{{r|Wolverine Vol 5 10|13}}

After this victory, Lord Deathstrike helped Sabretooth steal a strange sphere of incommensurable power in Madripoor.{{r|Wolverine Vol 6 1|9}} Sabretooth's goal was to swap [[Earth-616|this reality]] for another one in order to create a new primal world where there was no technology, no rules, and no powers that weren't physical. This world would benefit the strongest and in there Sabretooth would be a god.{{r|Wolverine Vol 6 10}} His plans failed when Mystique, Lord Deathstrike, the Silver Samurai, and the Hand were defeated by Wolverine and his allies.{{r|Wolverine Vol 6 11}} After his army fell, Sabretooth was ultimately defeated by Wolverine and, alongside the rest of his army, was taken into [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s custody.{{r|Wolverine Vol 6 12}}

===Assassin Guild===
Lord Deathstrike somehow escaped from S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody and resumed his assassin career. He was hired to retrieve a robot that could predict the future, which put him in conflict with [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] and the [[Mercs for Money (Earth-616)|Mercs for Money]]. {{r|Deadpool & the Mercs for Money Vol 1 1|5}} He then tried to assassinate [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] after hearing there was a bounty on his head, but he was defeated by the masked vigilante.{{r|Daredevil Vol 5 15}}

He later joined the [[Assassins Guild (Earth-616)|Assassins Guild]] and faced Deadpool again, but he was shot and beat alongside the rest of the guild.{{r|Deadpool: Assassin Vol 1 1|5}}
