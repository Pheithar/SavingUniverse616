| History                 = Andrea Hope was a researcher for [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] who was in charge of gathering information involving something referred to as the "Chaos" detail. But she was called in by Director [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] to help investigate the death of one of their own, Agent [[Damon Dran (Earth-616)|Damon Dran]]. Andrea wondered why Hill wanted her to handle this since she was only a researcher and that the mission seemed quite dangerous for someone of her experience.

Hill explained that Andrea had applied for operation status three times and she knows what it was like to be overlooked. After giving her a field agent promotion, Andrea asked if the death of Dran involved Chaos at all, but Hill did not know, all she had was a file which included classified details about [[Michael Collins (Earth-616)|Michael Collins]] and the [[Deathlok]] program.{{r|Deathlok Vol 5 1}}
