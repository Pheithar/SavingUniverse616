===Project: Troubleshooter===
'''General Robert L. Maverick''' worked for [[Project Troubleshooter (Earth-616)|Project: Troubleshooter]], the [[United States of America|United States]]' latest off-the-books facility for the production of human weapons. He oversaw the procedure that turned [[Todd Ziller (Earth-616)|Corporal Todd Ziller]] into a giant lizard monster, who would be nicknamed "American Kaiju" by Maverick.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 9}}

When [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|Avengers Idea Mechanics]] performed an illegal operation to rescue [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] from [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody, Maverick suggested to retaliate with the American Kaiju.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 8}} Maverick later observed as the American Kaiju was deployed against A.I.M. and witnessed as it was defeated and reverted back to his human form.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 10}}

[[File:Robert Maverick (Earth-616) from U.S.Avengers Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
===[[U.S.Avengers (Earth-616)|U.S.Avengers]]' [[Red Hulk]]===
Some time later, when A.I.M.'s leader [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Bobby Da Costa]] defeated the villainous [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]], he decided to bring him to the United States' government and for Maverick to be in their good graces and motivate cooperation between them.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 17}} Da Costa's alliance with Maverick resulted in A.I.M. being absorbed by S.H.I.E.L.D. and working with the American government, having become [[American Intelligence Mechanics (Earth-616)|American Intelligence Mechanics]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 17}} With the rebranding of A.I.M., Maverick became a member of its [[U.S.Avengers (Earth-616)|U.S.Avengers]]. Using an improved version of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Hulk Plug-In|Hulk Plug-Ins]], Maverick became the new '''[[Red Hulk]]'''.{{r|U.S.Avengers #1}}

The time-limit imposed by the Hulk Plug-In power caused Maverick to feel feeble. A [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] double-agent named [[Agent Kyle (Earth-616)|Kyle]] working within A.I.M. took advantage of this to offer Robert a nanite injection that could bypass the safety cutout.{{r|U.S.Avengers #5}} The nanites also allowed Hydra to take control of Red Hulk's body,{{r|U.S.Avengers #6}} forcing him to do their bidding and spent Hulked-out for the entirety of their short-lived reign in control of the United States.{{r|U.S.Avengers #7}} Even though da Costa burned the nanites from Maverick's blood,{{r|U.S.Avengers #8}} the nanites prevented him from turning back. Additionally, he had remained in Red Hulk state for roughly 800 times longer than he should've.

[[File:Robert Maverick (Earth-616) from U.S.Avengers Vol 1 11 001.jpg|thumb|right|Maverick's human form after having overtaxed]]
Following Hydra's defeat, Maverick underwent a painful and long process to revert back to his regular form because he couldn't remain as the Red Hulk due to pressing health concerns. Robert emerged from the procedure with heart damage, bone density loss, muscle tearing, high blood pressure and with his skin's pigment being permanently red.{{r|U.S.Avengers #10}} Maverick could still access to the Hulk Plug-In, but making use of it wasn't recommendable.{{r|U.S.Avengers #11}}

When the different teams of Avengers were caught in the middle of a contest between the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]]'s [[Lethal Legion (Grandmaster) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]] and the [[Challenger (Elder of the Universe) (Earth-616)|Challenger]]'s [[Black Order (Earth-616)|Black Order]], the Red Hulk was part of a group of Avengers deployed in [[Peru]] to investigate a fight between the competing teams to seize a [[Pyramoids|Pyramoid]].{{r|Avengers #677}} Maverick tried to claim the Pyramoid himself, but was beaten by the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]].{{r|Avengers #678}} Luckily for Maverick, whoever touched a Pyramoid was teleported away in such a manner it looked like they were disintegrated.{{r|Avengers #679}}

[[File:Avengers Vol 1 685 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Red Hulk's final stand]]
As soon as his Hulk Plug-In gave in, Red Hulk was benched and retreated to the [[Avengers Auxiliary Headquarters]].{{r|Avengers #680}} The final Pyramoid was teleported to the Auxiliary Headquarters by the Avengers infiltrator and the Grandmaster's secret player, [[Va Nee Gast (Earth-616)|Voyager]], who locked herself in a safe room with it. When the resurrected [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] attacked the Auxiliary HQ on behalf of the Challenger to claim the Pyramoid in Voyager's possession, Red Hulk faced him sporting [[Toni Ho (Earth-616)|Toni Ho]]'s [[Iron Patriot Armor Model 4|Iron Patriot Armor]].{{r|Avengers #684}} Maverick barely managed to fend off the Hulk, and was rather quickly overpowered. The Hulk drained all of the gamma energy from the Hulk Plug-In, additionally returning Robert his original skin tone. The [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] managed to distract the Hulk, giving [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] enough time to step into the scene and take Maverick to safety.{{r|Avengers #685}}

| body  = '''[[Hulk Plug-In]]:''' Maverick has an implant in his left arm that allows him to transform into a Hulk for one hour every day and a half, approximately.{{r|U.S.Avengers #1}} However, since this plug-in device was re-modified by Agent Kyle (who secretly was a Hydra double-agent), it seems that now he can stay in a Hulk form more than one hour.{{r|U.S.Avengers #9}} This grants him the following abilities:
* '''Super-Strength:''' Allegedly to the same level as the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], making Maverick strong enough to destroy the [[Secret Empire (Earth-616)|Secret Empire]]'s volcano island floating base by crash-landing into it.{{r|U.S.Avengers #1}}
** '''''Superhuman Strength Utilization:'''''  He also can slam his hands together to create a powerful sonic vibration that propagates through the air to knock down his opponents.{{r|U.S.Avengers #9}}
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' As the Red Hulk, Maverick possesses a high degree of resistance to physical injury that may instantly kill a human or lower level super humans.{{r|U.S.Avengers #4}}

| Abilities               = '''Skilled Combatant:''' as a trained soldier, Maverick is an expert in hand-to-hand combat.
| Strength                = Maverick possesses the normal human strength of a man of his age, height, and build who engages in moderate regular exercise. As Red Hulk he is listed as class 100.
| Weaknesses              = '''Health Issues:''' As a consequence of overtaxing his body when Hydra forced him to stay in Red Hulk form for longer than he should, Maverick suffers of severe health issues, including heart damage and high blood pressure. Because of this, he would need to be regularly medicated for the rest of his life.{{r|U.S.Avengers #10}}
