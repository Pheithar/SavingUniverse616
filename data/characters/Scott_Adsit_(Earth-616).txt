| Name2                   = {{r|Deadpool Vol 5 4}}{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 11}}

| History                 = Scott Adsit was a Level 6 agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.,{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 21}}{{r|A + X #18}} having worked for the agency for ten years,{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 8}} and a good friend of [[Emily Preston (Earth-616)|Agent Preston]]. He helped her and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] defeat numerous dead Presidents which were revived into zombies by a [[Michael Hawthorne (Necromancer) (Earth-616)|Necromancer]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 #1|6}}

After Preston was killed by the zombie [[George Washington (Earth-616)|President Washington]], he was one of the few people Deadpool told Preston's consciousness had survived after being put in his mind by the Necromancer, Adsit agreed to help them find a way to bring her back.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 11}}

Adsit tried to get S.H.I.E.L.D. to build a [[Life-Model Decoy|LMD]] in which Preston's mind would be transferred, but discovered one had already been built. As part of a bait to trap corrupt [[Agent Gorman (Earth-616)|Agent Gorman]], who was revealed to have built the LMD for shady purposes, Adsit told him about Preston's survival. He later met with [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-616)|Agent Coulson]], the one who wanted to set the bait.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 21}}

Scott alerted Deadpool that the LMD of Preston he found was evil, and told him they were now part of Coulson's plan. When they were cornered by criminals who wanted to kill Deadpool for the price Gorman put on his head, Adsit and Deadpool were saved by Coulson, who took them in [[Lola (Car)|his own S.H.I.E.L.D. flying car]] to [[Underground Liberated Totally Integrated Mobile Army To Unite Mankind (Earth-616)|U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.]]'s own helicarrier, where Gorman was meeting with the terrorist organization.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 22}}

After Deadpool destroyed U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.'s helicarrier and slaughtered their members,{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 23}} the organization tried to have revenge on him by killing his family and friends, Adsit was targeted while traveling in Manhattan, and even though he managed to defeat his attackers, he was heavily injured, but survived. After Deadpool retaliated and murdered all of U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.'s agents, he decided to give up his life as Deadpool. As he was celebrating the start of a new life with his friends and family, an [[Glossary:Incursion|incursion]] between [[Earth-616]] and the [[Earth-1610]] caused the collision and destruction of both universe's planets Earth, with Deadpool and his allies dying in the process.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 45}}

When the universe returned to life, so did the Earth and all of its inhabitants, including Scott. He left Deadpool's life,{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 1}} but when he discovered Deadpool was planning on finding out his parent's killers, Adsit decided to pay him a visit and tell him the truth before anything bad could happen. However, the Deadpool he confessed to resulted being an impostor of the real one, who stabbed Scott in the back after learning of this information.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 2}} The impostor kidnapped Adsit, and had him tortured and tied to a chair until he was found by the real Deadpool, who had been lured by his copycat, who was ultimately revealed being [[Madcap (Earth-616)|Madcap]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 3}}

Deadpool rescued Adsit and brought him to the [[Linda Carter (Earth-616)|Night Nurse]], who took care of him until Emily Preston had him leave.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 4}} Scott was later asked by Deadpool to join his mercenary agency, the [[Mercs for Money (Earth-616)|Mercs for Money]] in an organizational and tactical capacity.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 8}} Additionally, Adsit's new job allowed him to secretly oversee Deadpool and his teammates for S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 9}}

He was later seen throwing away his S.H.I.E.L.D. badge before going with other ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to aid in the reformation of the Nova Corps. Since the new incarnation of the Corps did not share the Nova Force with the new recruits, Scott's experience with conventional weapons and his S.H.I.E.L.D. training allowed him to quickly elevate to the rank of commander.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 30}}

When members of the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]] returned [[Warbringer (Earth-616)|Warbringer]] to Nova Corps custody, Adsit took custody of [[Samuel Alexander (Earth-616)|Sam Alexander's]] Nova helmet.{{r|Infinity Countdown: Champions Vol 1 2}} Sometime later, [[Kaldera (Earth-616)|Kaldera]] and Sam arrived at one of the Nova Corps outposts where the helmet was located. The two took Adsit hostage and was forced to return the helmet, which he agreed to mostly because no one knew how to work it. To their shock, the helmet was missing. Upon discovering a member of the [[Thieves Guild (Earth-616)|Thieves Guild]] stole the helmet right under their noses, Adsit bemoaned both his hostage situation and losing the helmet.{{r|Champions Vol 3 7}}

Later, the Nova Corps was wiped out by an alternate-reality [[Universal Church of Truth (Earth-TRN666)|Universal Church of Truth]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 7}}{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Nova Vol 1 1}} Whether Adsit was one of the Nova Corpsmen that perished or not is unknown.
