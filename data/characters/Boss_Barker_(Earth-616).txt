| Powers                  = * '''Skrull Shape-Shifting''': Like other [[Skrulls]], is a shape-shifter. They can mentally cause the unstable molecules that comprise his or her body to become pliant, enabling him or her to assume other forms through muscular expansion and contraction. Once a new shape has been assumed, it takes a conscious act of will to assume another form or revert to natural. Hence, Skrulls do not spontaneously lose their assumed form when asleep or unconscious. Skrulls in altered form will, however, revert to their original forms at the moment of death. 
| Abilities               = * '''Skrull Military Training''':  is a trained [[Skrulls|Skrull]] soldier.

There is a limit to the size of the object or person a Skrull can imitate. The average Skrull cannot distend his or her mass any more than 1.5 times as large a volume as his or her original volume, nor can he or she contract his or her mass any more than 0.75 a volume as his or her original. 

| Equipment               = * '''[[Skrulls|Skrull]]-Military Uniform''': wears a [[Skrulls|Skrull]]-military uniform, which alters as he changes shape and size.
