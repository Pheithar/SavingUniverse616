When she was first seen, Black Lotus had been hired, along with several other assassins, by [[Damon Dran (Earth-616)|Damon Dran]] to capture the [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]]. Black Lotus helped to initially subdue the Widow with a kick to the head. However, she, along with the other assassins, was instead defeated by the Black Widow after she came to her senses.{{r|Marvel Fanfare #11|12}}

Later, Black Lotus was one of the costumed "super-women" recruited by [[Deidre Wentworth (Earth-616)|Superia]] to come to Femizonia Island and join her all-female army, the [[Femizons (Earth-616)|Femizons]]. While en route to Femizonia, the heroes [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]] located them, but were discovered. Black Lotus participated in the en masse assault by the Femizons that resulted in the capture of the two heroes.{{r|Captain America #391}}
