| History                 = 
===Early Life===
Shang was raised to become a deadly assassin by his father, the immortal crime lord and sorcerer [[Zheng Zu (Earth-616)|Fu Manchu]]. However, Shang-Chi became aware of his father's evil nature and defected after his first assignment.{{r|Special Marvel Edition #15}} He then began to attack various elements of his father's criminal empire and allied himself with his father's archenemy, [[Denis Nayland Smith (Earth-616)|Denis Nayland Smith]], and [[MI6 (Earth-616)|MI-6]].{{r|Master of Kung Fu #18}} In retaliation, Fu Manchu sent a number of assassins to kill him.

His travels led him to meet a number of other martial artists and superheroes around the world: he met his rival, [[Shen Kuei (Earth-616)|Cat]];{{r|Master of Kung Fu #38|39}} and teamed up with [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], [[Jonathan Hart (Earth-616)|Jack of Hearts]], and [[Hector Ayala (Earth-616)|White Tiger]] to take down the [[Corporation (Earth-616)|Corporation]].{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #31}}

After years of playing at "games of deceit and death", Shang-Chi retired from the espionage world. He resurfaced to assist his old friends from MI-6 against the Si-Fan ninjas.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #1|8}}

===Marvel Knights===
When [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] wanted a task force to help him finally capture the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] and make him face legal justice, Shang-Chi became a part of that group. The martial artist assisted Daredevil, [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], and their allies against the Punisher and several other threats before the group went their separate ways.{{r|{{cl|Marvel Knights Vol 1 1}}-[[Marvel Knights Vol 1 15|15]]}}

===Heroes for Hire===
When the Superhuman Registration Act was signed into law, Shang-Chi joined [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]] as part of [[Heroes for Hire (Knight & Wing) (Earth-616)|their Heroes for Hire team of investigators and superhuman bail bondsmen]].

During this time, he developed romantic feelings for his teammate [[Maria Vasquez (Earth-616)|Tarantula]], but her overly violent nature shamed him, and he lost his center. During [[World War Hulk|the Hulk's invasion of Manhattan]], their teammate [[Buchanan Mitty (Earth-616)|Humbug]] killed one of the insect-like hatchlings as they infiltrated the hive. Humbug was then seduced into an insect hive-mind with [[No-Name (Earth-616)|No-Name]] of the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]].

When the hive tried to identify the hatchling's killer, Humbug gave the hive Tarantula's name instead. Shang-Chi infiltrated the hive with the intent to rescue Humbug and hopefully sever his link to the newborn hive. After hearing of Humbug's betrayal of Tarantula, however, Shang-Chi lost his temper and murdered Humbug. Grieving over how completely he had lost his way, Shang-Chi left the Heroes to meditate and renew his connection to his spirit.{{r|{{cl|Heroes for Hire Vol 2 1}}-[[Heroes for Hire Vol 2 15|15]]}}

===Secret Avengers===
Shang-Chi's illustrious father returned to the world with the assistance of the [[Shadow Council (Earth-616)|Shadow Council]]. Shang teamed up with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]] and [[Secret Avengers (Black Ops Unit) (Earth-616)|his Secret Avengers]] to oppose his father.{{r|Secret Avengers #6|10}} After that, he became an important ally for Rogers' unit, aiding the team whenever they needed.{{r|Secret Avengers #18}}{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #3}}

===[[Spider-Island (Event)|Spider-Island]]===
Before the events of Spider-Island, the new Madame Web, [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Julia Carpenter]], asked Shang-Chi to train [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] in martial arts to compensate for the loss of his spider-sense. He donned special magnetic gloves and shoes during their sparring sessions to help Spider-Man develop a [[Glossary:Way of the Spider|unique fighting style]] that complemented his spider powers.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Infested Vol 1 1}}

When ordinary New Yorkers started developing spider powers, Spider-Man was forced to rely on Shang-Chi's training in several situations. When his spider-sense returned, it worked in harmony with the techniques Shang taught him, turning the tide in a decisive battle against [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Tarantula]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #672}}

Eventually, Shang-Chi became infected by [[Spider-Virus|the spider plague]] and developed the same set of powers as Spider-Man. Shang then fought alongside other heroes in defending New York against the threat of spider-powered criminals.

During this time, he had horrible nightmares that involved the [[Immortal Weapons (Earth-616)|Immortal Weapons]] and himself as a spider attacking innocent civilians. When he discussed with Madame Web about his nightmares, she left him only with a cryptic fortune. After joining Iron Fist in combat, the two discovered that they had been sharing the same nightmares. Their meeting was cut short when the [[Bride of Nine Spiders (Earth-616)|Bride of Nine Spiders]] joined the fray and asked Danny to speak with her on a rooftop in private. Sensing something was wrong, Shang followed the two and witnessed the Bride attack and incapacitate Iron Fist. Jumping to his friend's defense, Shang utilized his newly acquired spider powers to easily pin down the Bride, but was caught off-guard and knocked out by his assailant's supernatural fighting technique.

Awakening later on at his apartment and aided by [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]], Shang-Chi concluded that the Bride of Nine Spiders was the source of his nightmares. He identified a street sign in one of his dreams and tracked the Bride to an abandoned house in Hamilton Heights. The house had adverse effects on Shang's senses, weakening his reflexes despite his acquired spider powers. After overcoming several hallucinations and physical traps, he was able to find the Bride and the other Immortal Weapons whom she cocooned in webbing. While Shang was able to hold his own against the Bride despite his affliction, he took the opportunity to free Iron Fist and increase their odds.

Badly weakened due to being incapacitated, Danny was nevertheless able to muster enough chi energy to strike the Bride with his signature punch, setting her up to receive a vicious knock-out kick from Shang. While Danny attempted to heal the Bride of Nine Spiders, Shang-Chi succumbed to the spider plague and passed out, becoming a spider in the process. Simultaneously, [[Ai Apaec (Earth-616)|Ai Apaec]] descended from the ceiling and revealed himself as the true mastermind behind the kidnapping of the Immortal Weapons. The South American chimera god then explained that he had been working with the [[Adriana Soria (Earth-616)|Queen]], and the Bride was offered as payment for his services. After Iron Fist used his Chi force to cure Shang-Chi, leaving himself weakened, Iron Fist and the rest of the Immortal Weapons evacuated the building, prompting Shang-Chi to collapse it on top of Ai Apaec leaving him trapped for the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] to imprison him once more.{{r|{{cl|Spider-Island: Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 1 1}}-[[Spider-Island: Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 1 3|3]]}}

===Joining the Avengers===
After the events of [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers vs X-Men]], Captain America and [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] wanted to make a new, bigger, stronger Avengers team. Shang-Chi was among the first heroes to be chosen for this new initiative. He then accepted an offer from Captain America and saw it as an opportunity to challenge himself. Although Stark acknowledged Shang as an extraordinary hand-to-hand combatant, he wanted to take advantage of Shang's mastery of traditional weaponry and providing him with personalized equipment. 

During a mission on [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]], several core members of the Avengers were captured by The Garden, leaving Captain America to assemble the rest of the team to mount a counterattack. Shang was among the many heroes who join a second assault on Mars, as part of a rescue effort to retrieve their companions. During the battle, he faced off against [[Aleph (Garden) (Earth-616)|the world-razing robot Aleph]] and critically damaged its left leg. Although the damage was eventually self-repaired, Aleph is shortly destroyed by [[Tamara Devoux (Earth-616)|Tamara Devoux]], [[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]], when the robot refused to stand down. The Avengers eventually triumph over The Garden and allow them to continue their purpose on Mars, granted they leave [[Earth]] alone for good.{{r|{{cl|Avengers Vol 5 1}}-[[Avengers Vol 5 3|3]]}}

A short while later, Shang was asked by Rogers and Stark to interview the new Captain Universe and find out what the purpose of her presence was. Shang felt it more appropriate to speak with the Uni-Power's host, Tamara Devoux, and 'lured' her out with pie. Using meditative techniques, he helped piece together Tamara's traumatizing past. It was revealed afterwards that the Uni-Power manifested at this time because of the Earth's pivotal role in events to come, and it chose Tamara as a host because she was dying, much like the universe itself.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 6}}

Later on, Shang and a team of Avengers went to a casino in Macau to investigate [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] activities. While following his own leads, Shang was attacked by ninjas lead by a mysterious armored figure. After utilizing a pair of electrified nunchaku provided by Stark, Shang defeated their leader and took his helmet as a souvenir. He reveals to his teammates that A.I.M. was bidding to hire mercenaries, and that the insidious organization was preparing for a large scale conflict.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 11}}

===[[Infinity (Event)|Infinity]]===
Shang-Chi was with the Avengers when they joined the [[Galactic Council (Earth-616)|Galactic Council]] to fight against the [[Builders (Race)|Builders]] and their crusade against all life in [[Earth-616|the universe]]. When several allies were captured by the enemy, Shang formed a rescue team with [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]], and [[Eden Fesi (Earth-616)|Manifold]]. Wielding a pair of energy projecting gauntlets, Shang's timely intervention prevented his friends from being vaporized by an [[Alephs|Aleph]].

After the Builders were defeated by the alliance forces, the Avengers returned to Earth with their new Galactic Council allies to face off against an even bigger threat back home - an untimely assault by Thanos. Shang was sent along with Black Widow and Manifold the infiltrate the Peak and shut down Thanos' first line of defense. However, the team was intercepted by the [[Black Dwarf (Earth-616)|Black Dwarf]] and a complement of guards. As Manifold returned to grab reinforcements, Shang and Natasha managed to defeat the entire security force, save the general who proved to be too much for even the Master of Kung Fu. The combined might of [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]], [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan]], and other Council members eventually made short work of the Black Dwarf and allowed Shang and the infiltration team to complete their mission.{{r|Infinity #1|6}}

===Avengers World===
[[File:Shang-Chi (Earth-616) and Pym Particles from Avengers World Vol 1 14 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Using [[Pym Particles]]]]
With the threat of both the Builders and Thanos thwarted, Shang-Chi was sent to [[Madripoor]] along with [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|Avengers World #1}} The [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] and the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] used a ritual to awaken a dormant dragon below the island. Shang-Chi tried to oppose him but failed.{{r|Avengers World #3}} The dragon then proceeded to fly to [[Hong Kong]], where it encountered the resistance from the [[Ascendants (Earth-616)|Ascendants]].{{r|Avengers World #7}}{{r|Avengers World #13}} Using [[Pym Particles]], Shang Chi was turned into a giant, and defeated the dragon in combat, but before that he tore off Gorgon's headquarters from Madripoor and threw it several miles away.{{r|Avengers World #14}}

===[[Time Runs Out]]===
After one of [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]]'s origin bombs hit the city of [[Kobe (Japan)|Kobe]] in [[Japan]], Shang-Chi volunteered to explore the site along with [[Aikku Jokinen (Earth-616)|Pod]]. Once they arrived there, they came across a malleable genesis matter that was both the bi-product and the collective remains of the people of Kobe. It was revealed by Sunspot that a Hand and two S.H.I.E.L.D. teams disappeared in the collective matter because they tried to resist it, but Shang-Chi submitted to it.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 38}} While in the matter, he experiences a vision of a dragon and an old man. The old man challenges him to a test in a dojo to see if he is worthy of the power of the Kobe site and faces him with another Shang-Chi. Both Shang-Chis begin to fight, with the other one gaining the upper hand, until Shang-Chi realizes that he must accept his demons instead of battling them, thus gaining the power of the Kobe site, which was replication.{{r|Avengers World #20}}{{r|Avengers Vol 5 38}} 

===Deadly Hands of Kung Fu===
Shang-Chi was drawn back into the world of espionage when his former lover [[Leiko Wu (Earth-616)|Leiko Wu]] was murdered by [[Douglas Scott (Earth-616)|Razor-Fist]] while on assignment in [[London (England)|London]]'s Chinatown. Shang-Chi reluctantly joined forces with [[Chao Sima (Earth-616)|Skull Crusher]] to investigate Leiko's death. Both of them discovered that Leiko's death had been orchestrated by [[White Dragon (Chinatown) (Earth-616)|White Dragon]]. Shang-Chi and Skull Crusher broke into [[White Dragon's Estate]], where they discovered the decapitated heads of several [[Triad (Earth-616)|Triad]] leaders. [[M'Nai (Earth-616)|Midnight Sun]] revealed himself to be behind the deaths and used black magic to restrain Shang-Chi and Skull Crusher. Midnight Sun explained that the heads of the Triads were required for a ritual to gain influence and control over the Triads, granting him power to rule China as his adoptive father Zheng Zu planned. Midnight Sun decapitated Skull-Crusher and White Dragon, who willingly offered his life, as the last steps of the ritual. Instead of giving him power, the ritual resurrected Leiko, who Skull Crusher named as the head of his clan before their deaths. Leiko used her newfound powers to drag Midnight Sun into the netherworld, free Shang-Chi from his restraints and maim Razor-Fist. When the [[Daughters of the Dragon (Earth-616)|Daughters of the Dragon]], [[Sons of the Tiger (Earth-616)|Sons of the Tiger]], and [[Jack Tarr (Earth-616)|Black Jack Tarr]] arrived to back up Shang-Chi, Leiko fled the estate.{{r|{{cl|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 2 1}}-[[Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 2 4|4]]}}

===The Protectors===
Shang-Chi joined the Asian American superheroes [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Hulk]], [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Silk]], [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]], [[James Woo (Earth-616)|Jimmy Woo]], and [[Jake Oh (Earth-616)|Jake Oh]] for a fundraiser in [[Flushing]], [[Queens]]. While the group was spending the night out in [[Manhattan]] they were ambushed by [[Phalkan (Earth-616)|Prince Regent Phalkan]] and his army. Shang-Chi and his allies briefly fought off the invaders before they and a large group of bystanders were teleported near [[Seknarf Seven]], where Phalkan demanded that the group offer a few people as a sacrifice. Dubbing their group "The Protectors", Woo rallied the group and bystanders into working together to escape, while Shang-Chi led an attack with Silk and Ms. Marvel. The Protectors were eventually able to free themselves and defeat Phalkan and his forces with the help of the bystanders. Afterwards, the [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight Space Program]] arrived to rescue the Protectors and bystanders and arrest Phalkan.{{r|{{cl|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 15}}-[[Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 18|18]]}}

===New Agents of Atlas===
Shang-Chi and the Protectors were recruited by Jimmy Woo into the [[Agents of Atlas (Earth-616)|Agents of Atlas]] and headed to [[Seoul]] to defend it from [[Sindr (Earth-616)|Sindr]] and [[Fire Demons of Muspelheim|her forces]] of [[Muspelheim]], joining forces with a few [[South Korea|South Korean]] superheroes. When Sindr and her Fire Goblins proved to much for them, Shang-Chi, the New Agents of Atlas and their allies were forced to retreat, allowing Sindr to capture Seoul. Running out options, [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Brawn]] summoned more Asian-based superheroes to assist Atlas and formulated a new plan to defeat Sindr. Per Brawn's strategy, the team was split up, with Shang-Chi's group being sent to Atlas' ally [[Sun Wukong (Earth-616)|Monkey King]] in Northern [[China]] where Shang-Chi began training the team for their last stand against Sindr. With Shang-Chi's training, the New Agents of Atlas were able to defeat Sindr and her forces, although Monkey King and [[M-41 Zu (Earth-616)|M-41 Zu]] were killed in the battle. When Sindr used the [[Black Bifrost]] to flee, Shang-Chi and the others followed her to the [[Great Wall of China]] where they helped [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] defeat her.{{r|{{cl|War of the Realms: New Agents of Atlas Vol 1 1}}-[[War of the Realms: New Agents of Atlas Vol 1 4|4]]}} Shang-Chi also assisted in routing the remaining Fire Goblins from [[Shanghai]] with [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], and the [[Warriors Three (Earth-616)|Warriors Three]].{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 5}}

After the War of the Realms, Shang-Chi encountered [[Lin Lie (Earth-616)|Sword Master]] in [[New York City]] searching for his missing father and took him under his wing.{{r|Sword Master Vol 1 1}} Shang-Chi and Sword Master were reunited with the New Agents of Atlas when [[Flushing]] and other Asian communities in every major city were merged into the portal city of [[Pan (Portal City)|Pan]] by tech mogul [[Michael Nguyen (Earth-616)|Mike Nguyen]]. Despite their suspicions of Nguyen and his hired mercenary, [[Isaac Ikeda (Earth-616)|Issac Ikeda]], the "Protector of Pan", the New Agents of Atlas agreed to protect the city after it was besieged by [[Wyverns]] and [[Sea Serpents]].{{r|{{cl|Agents of Atlas Vol 3 1}}-[[Agents of Atlas Vol 3 3|3]]}} Shang-Chi and Sword Master were confronted by [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]], who demanded Lin Lie's [[Sword of Fu Xi]] to confront the kidnapper of his son [[Drakon Ismenios (Earth-616)|Ismenios]], who Ares believed was another god. Coming to a truce, the three were able to track Ismenios to a temple in [[Madripoor]], where they confronted his kidnapper, the Mother Goddess of Madripoor [[Davi Naka (Earth-616)|Davi Naka]]. Naka explained that she imprisoned Ismenios for his protection after the young drakon was caught stealing from [[Atlantis]]' treasure hoard during the absence of [[Kala Teer (Earth-616)|its sea serpent guardian]]. Despite Naka's attempt to placate the kingdom. [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|King Namor]] was still outraged over the missing dragon.{{r|{{cl|Sword Master Vol 1 2}}-[[Sword Master Vol 1 6|6]]}} It was later revealed that Atlantis' dragon had been captured by the [[Big Nguyen Comapny (Earth-616)|Big Nguyen Company]], who had been harvesting her scales to power Pan's portals. Upon this discovery, an enraged Namor launched an invasion of Pan to reclaim his stolen dragon.{{r|Agents of Atlas Vol 3 5}}

Shang-Chi and the other New Agents of Atlas were summoned by Brawn during his confrontation with Namor, who warned the group to return Atlantis' dragon in a day or else face the wrath of Atlantis before retreating. Shang-Chi and the other New Agents were subsequently introduced to the original Agents of Atlas by Woo. When Woo sent [[Aquaria Neptunia (Earth-616)|Namora]], [[Venus (Siren) (Earth-616)|Venus]], [[Lei Ling (Earth-616)|Aero]], and [[Pearl Pangan (Earth-616)|Wave]] to Atlantis for a diplomatic mission, Brawn discretely ordered Shang-Chi and Sword Master to spy on Namora, due to her familial ties with Namor. The dragon was eventually released from captivity, but upon arriving home she unexpectedly went berserk and attacked the underwater kingdom. Witnessing the destruction caused by the dragon, Shang-Chi relayed to Amadeus that Atlantis' scientists discovered an implant embedded in the dragon's scales to be the source of her behavior and that Namor believed Amadeus to be behind the sabotage, prompting the king to resume his attack on Pan.{{r|{{cl|Atlantis Attacks Vol 1 1}}-[[Atlantis Attacks Vol 1 2|2]]}} When Amadeus was forcibly transformed into the Hulk and put under Nguyen's control with Sirena tech in a last ditch effort to destroy Atlantis, Shang-Chi was able to remove the device from Amadeus, freeing him from Nguyen's control and reverting him back into Brawn. After the conflict, Shang-Chi admonished Woo for using the team as his pawns and subsequently left Atlas.{{r|Atlantis Attacks Vol 1 5}}

===Five Weapons Society===
While working as a baker in [[San Francisco]]'s [[Chinatown (San Francisco)|Chinatown]], Shang-Chi was approached by Leiko, who informed him that MI-6 had discovered his father's organization was active again. The two were attacked by assassins but were rescued by Shang-Chi's previously unknown half siblings, [[Brother Sabre (Takeshi) (Earth-616)|Brother Sabre]] and [[Sister Dagger (Esme) (Earth-616)|Sister Dagger]]. The two revealed that Shang-Chi had been chosen by Zheng Zu's spirit as the next Supreme Commander of the [[Five Weapons Society (Earth-616)|Five Weapons Society]], the true name of their father's organization, and requested his help to depose its illegitimate leader, [[Zheng Shi-Hua (Earth-616)|Sister Hammer]], who sought Shang-Chi's death to maintain her control. Realizing that Sister Hammer was his long lost full sister, Shi-Hua, Shang-Chi instead decided to save her from their father's cult. Shang-Chi arrived at the [[House of the Deadly Staff]] in [[London (England)|London]] to meet Shi-Hua, who surprisingly greeted him warmly. Shi-Hua recounted the history of the Society and its five Houses, including its many names and aliases, to Shang-Chi, who tried to convince her to leave the Society by revealing Zheng Zu's true nature. Shi-Hua refused, having been brainwashed by Zheng Zu's upbringing, and expressed outrage that he would choose his son, who killed him, over her. 

Shang-Chi fell unconscious due to the poison Shi-Hua discreetly fed him and awakened in a lab, where he was attacked by a swarm of [[Jiangshi]]. Shang-Chi was grievously wounded by a jiangshi but was rescued by Brother Sabre and Sister Dagger, who took him to the [[House of the Deadly Dagger]] in [[France]] to recuperate. As Shang-Chi noticed his wound had begun turning him into a jiangshi, he was approached by the [[Ghost|ghost]] of his uncle, [[Zheng Yi (Earth-616)|Zheng Yi]], who directed him to a map in the House's shrine room. Shang-Chi and his siblings followed the map to his uncle's tomb in [[Henan]], whose spirit appeared in full view to his nephew. Shang-Chi requested Yi's guidance on stopping Shi-Hua and her jiangshi army and for a cure for his wounds. Instead, Yi told Shang-Chi to stop running away from his family as they would always be a part of his life, otherwise he would lose his way like his father and revealed the truth behind Zheng Zu's past. As Shi-Hua and her jiangshi army laid waste to London, Shang-Chi and his siblings arrived as reinforcements for Leiko and MI-6, providing them with Taoist amulets to purify the jiangshi. During the battle, Shang-Chi's wound further mutated him into a jiangshi, allowing Shi-Hua to exert control over him. When Shang-Chi began resisting, Shi-Hua placed a microchip on him to completely control him. Recalling his uncle's words, Shang-Chi stopped resisting and calmed himself. Upon doing so, the two found themselves transported to the [[Astral Plane]] where they witnessed Shi-Hua's memories of her harsh upbringing in the [[House of the Deadly Hammer]] in [[Russia]]. When a vision of Zheng Zu attacked them, Shang-Chi defeated and restrained him, showing Shi-Hua Zu's true nature to her. Finally realizing what their father truly was, Shi-Hua renounced him, causing her jiangshi to collapse and Shang-Chi's wounds to heal. However, Shi-Hua rebuffed Shang-Chi's attempt for reconciliation, blaming him for robbing her of her life's purpose. When Leiko attempted to shoot Shi-Hua, Shang-Chi caught the bullet, allowing Shi-Hua to flee. Shang-Chi was subsequently named the new Supreme Commander of the Five Weapons Society and vowed to use it to protect all humankind. After the ceremony, Shang-Chi was visited by Zheng Zu's spirit, who remarked that his throne suited him and that he was destined to become just like him.{{r|{{cl|Shang-Chi Vol 1 1}}-[[Shang-Chi Vol 1 5|5]]}}

===Enter the Phoenix===
When the cosmic force known as the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] returned to Earth, it staged a contest to determine its next host, and Shang-Chi was one of many individuals summoned to the [[White Hot Room]] for it. The Phoenix empowered the assembled champions and had them fight each other in trials by combat.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 40}} For his first round, Shang-Chi was pitted against [[Mark Milton (Mephisto's Simulacrum) (Earth-616)|Hyperion]]. Due to the Phoenix Force's influence overloading his senses to the point of insanity, Hyperion immediately forfeited the match, granting Shang-Chi an easy victory.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 41}}

For his next match, Shang-Chi was pitted against Captain America. Believing Shang-Chi to be the best suited of all the candidates to becoming the Phoenix's next host, Captain America convinced a reluctant Shang-Chi to defeat him in their battle to help him control its power. During the fight, Shang-Chi was able to draw in and control more of the Phoenix's power. Just as he landed the final blow, Shang-Chi refused to use his powers to kill, which caused the Phoenix to intervene and eliminate him from the tournament, giving Captain America the win.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 41}} 

===Supreme Commander===
While shutting down a rogue Society-operated drug ring with Sister Dagger in [[Manhattan]], Shang-Chi took a rare break from his newfound duties as Supreme Commander to take [[Delilah Wang (Earth-616)|Delilah Wang]] on a romantic dinner. However, Sister Dagger interrupted his date by delivering a captured drug dealer to the restaurant. While Shang-Chi and Sister Dagger argued, the dealer attempted to kill the two with his clawed hands but was defeated. Discovering that the dealer had a [[Spider-Tracer]] on him, the two were approached by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], who was tracking the criminal while investigating a weapons ring. Believing the two groups were connected, Spider-Man offered to help Shang-Chi with his investigation. Shang-Chi reluctantly accepted but did not tell Spider-Man about the Society. The three discovered that the two rings were being led by [[King Wild Man (Earth-616)|King Wild Man]], a loyal follower of [[Zheng Zu (Earth-616)|Zheng Zu]] who manufactured and trafficked [[Yeren Root]] that transformed users into monstrous [[Wikipedia:Yeren|Yeren]]. Refusing to accept Shang-Chi as the new Supreme Commander, King Wild Man attached a root onto Spider-Man which transformed him into a Yeren. Shang-Chi and Sister Dagger were able to free Spider-Man from the root while King Wild Man escaped during the confusion. Feeling guilty for Spider-Man's injuries and Sister Dagger's accusations that he was ashamed of his family, Shang-Chi revealed his family's history and his new title to Spider-Man and summoned the [[Warriors of the Deadly Dagger (Earth-616)|Warriors of the Deadly Dagger]] to remove all traces of the Yeren root from King Wild Man's warehouse.{{r|Shang-Chi Vol 2 1}}   

Discovering that the [[Iron Eighty-Eight (Earth-616)|Iron Eighty-Eight triad]] were auctioning off a [[Cosmic Cube]], Shang-Chi and Brother Sabre traveled to [[Macau]] to prevent the Cube from being purchased by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] and [[Hand (Earth-616)|the Hand]]. The two attended the auction while representing the Five Weapons Society, pretending to maintain the Society's' villainous nature to not arouse the suspicions of the other attending criminals and hostess [[Lady Iron Fan (Earth-616)|Lady Iron Fan]], Brother Sabre's former lover. When a representative of the Hand unexpectedly outbid the Society for the Cube, Shang-Chi used a hidden communicator cuff link to alert [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], who interrupted the auction. Shang-Chi and Captain America worked together to apprehend the criminals and secure the Cube, which Shang-Chi gave to Captain America. Unbeknownst to Shang-Chi, Brother Sabre, hurt that Shang-Chi did not inform him of his plans with Captain America and for ruining his relationship with Lady Iron Fan, used the Cube's power to trick Captain America into taking a duplicate of the Cube and to help Lady Iron Fan escape.{{r|Shang-Chi Vol 2 2}}  

When footage of his exiled half-sister [[Zheng Zhilan (Earth-616)|Zheng Zhilan]] resurfaced on social media, Shang-Chi traveled with Brother Sabre and Sister Dagger to [[Ireland]] to bring her back to the Society.  The reunion escalated into an all-out confrontation, which was interrupted by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], who revealed that Zhilan was a [[Homo superior|mutant]] and believed Shang-Chi had embraced his father's evil and was trying to kill her.  During their fight, Shang saved Wolverine from falling into a ravine, which convinced him and Zhilan that his intentions were pure.  Realizing that Shang-Chi had been implementing the same reforms that she sought for the Society, Zhilan rejoined her family as the new Sister Staff.{{r|Shang-Chi Vol 2 3}}

'''Phoenix Force:''' During the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]]'s tournament, Shang-Chi became empowered by a portion of its power. Shang-Chi gained superhuman strength, cosmic pyrokinesis and the ability to create a three-pronged staff out of cosmic energy. Due to the lack of darkness in Shang-Chi's soul, the Phoenix rejected him as a host, and disqualified him from the contest.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 42}}

| Trivia                  = 
* Although Shang-Chi was a uniquely Marvel Comics creation, many of his supporting cast members including Fu Manchu, Fah Lo Suee and Sir Denis Nayland Smith, were actually the creation of early 20th century novelist [[Wikipedia:Sax Rohmer|Sax Rohmer]]. Fu Manchu and Denis Nayland Smith made their literary debuts in the 1916 novel, ''The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu''.
* In 1995, Marvel Comics almost outsourced the production of a line of four interconnected series to Milestone Media. Shang-Chi was going to star one of these books. The pitch of the story, written by [[Dwayne McDuffie]], consisted of Shang-Chi traveling around the globe to dismantle his father's criminal empire and also adding firearms to his combat repertoire. The entire project fell apart since McDuffie had arranged it with [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Mark Gruenwald]]. DeFalco would be soon replaced as Editor-in-Chief, and Gruenwald would pass away a year later.<ref>[https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-milestone-media-1995 Comic Legends: Did Milestone Almost Do a Marvel Comic Line in 1995?]</ref>
