===Early Life===
[[File:Jerome_Beechman_(Earth-616)_from_Defenders_Vol_1_90.jpg|thumb|left|Mandrill's origin!]]Jerome Beechman was the mutant son of Frederic Beechman, an atomic research scientist at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], in [[Los Alamos]], [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]], and his wife Emily. Prior to his conception, Beechman's father, a Caucasian scientist, as well as [[Gemma Sinclair (Earth-616)|Gemma Sinclair]], a black cleaning woman, were exposed to a massive dose of radiation when faulty electrical wiring caused an explosion that breached the facility's small experimental nuclear pile. A year later, the scientist's son was born with black skin and tufts of body hair. Equally distressing to Gemma Sinclair and her husband was the birth of their daughter Nekra, who was born with chalky-white skin and fangs. The boy grew up hated by his peers and parents for his freakish appearance. When Beechman was ten, his father drove him out to the middle of the American desert and abandoned him. The boy swore to find his way back and exact revenge on his parents.{{r|Shanna, The She-Devil #4}}

===Nekra===
While in the desert, he encountered the Sinclairs' mutant girl, [[Nekra Sinclair (Earth-616)|Nekra]], who had been similarly mistreated and was running away from home. The two became partners and wandered the Southwest, protecting one another and shunning all other human companionship, surviving by stealth and cunning. For six years, the two educated themselves by listening outside of schoolroom windows and reading stolen books. One night, angry New Mexican townspeople discovered them, having heard rumors about "monsters" invading their hometown, and attacked them with pitchforks and guns. That night, Beechman and Sinclair discovered that sheer hate released latent mutant powers within them, powers they used to slay their tormentors.{{r|Shanna, The She-Devil #4}}

===Mandrill===
As his mutant powers surfaced, Beechman's appearance became more apelike, prompting him to take the alias '''Mandrill.''' With Nekra's aid, he developed plans for the overthrow of three small West African nations with the intent of creating a Utopian society, free from the American values which caused the two of them to be treated as outcasts. Their plan failed, however, when they were thwarted by the jungle adventurer [[Shanna O'Hara (Earth-616)|Shanna the She-Devil]]. The villains escaped and, while doing so, they killed Gerald O'Hara, Shanna's father.{{r|Shanna, The She-Devil #4|5}}

Mandrill and Nekra regrouped and formed [[Black Spectre (Criminal Organization) (Earth-616)|Black Spectre]], an organization of black women dedicated to the overthrow of the American government - which firstly led the Mandrill to fight [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|The Thing]] and [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] on his own{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #3}}. This conspiracy, which culminated on the White House lawn, was finally thwarted by the hero Daredevil with the help of Shanna and the [[Natasha Romanoff (Earth-616)|Black Widow]]. This time, both the Mandrill and Nekra were defeated, although the Mandrill escaped capture.{{r|Daredevil #110|112}}

Nekra was taken into custody by the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], while Mandrill escaped. Forsaking his longtime ally, Mandrill, still dedicated to world conquest, organized the [[Fem-Force (Mandrill) (Earth-616)|Fem-Force]], another woman's army composed of American radicals and dissidents.{{r|Defenders #78|80}} Aiding them was the third team of evil mutants [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] had organized and abandoned, a group he called the [[Mutant Force (Earth-616)|Mutant Force]]. When his mutant allies were taken captive by the hero team Defenders, Mandrill sent the Fem-Force to the Indian Point Nuclear Power Generating Facility, where his father and mother were now employed, to seek revenge upon them.{{r|Defenders #85}} Once again opposed by the Defenders, Mandrill was stopped when his own mother shot him. Mandrill escaped capture, however, and was rescued by members of his army.{{r|Defenders #89|91}}

[[File:Eric Williams (Earth-616) and Jerome Beechman (Earth-616) from Avengers West Coast Vol 2 66 0001.jpg|left|thumb]]
Later, Nekra had successfully raised her former ally, the [[Eric Williams (Earth-616)|Grim Reaper]], from the dead, although he promptly killed her. Trying to get revenge on the Grim Reaper for her death, Mandrill confronted the Reaper, but was seemingly killed himself as the Reaper drained his body's life-force.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #66}}

Somehow, the Mandrill survived and was captured, shrunk using [[Pym Particles]] and sent to the experimental [[Big House|Ant-Hill]] prison. A massive break-out was stopped by the [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]].{{r|She-Hulk #5|6}} The Mandrill was transferred to another prison, [[The Raft]], from where he escaped.{{r|New Avengers #1|4}}

The Mandrill joined [[William Cross (Earth-616)|Crossfire]] as a member of his team of evil mind-controllers, [[Crossfire's Crew (Earth-616)|Crossfire's Crew]],{{r|Spider-Man: Breakout #1|5}} but he was captured again, this time by [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]].{{r|I (heart) Marvel: Web of Romance Vol 1 1}}

===Hood's Gang===
The Mandrill recently joined the crime syndicate of [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|The Hood]], who would attempt to take advantage of the split in the superhero community.{{r|New Avengers #35}} The Mandrill was sent to fight the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], but was defeated by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]].{{r|New Avengers Annual #2}}

Mandrill was seen in [[Alexei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Alyosha Kravinoff]]'s zoo of animal-themed super-villains. [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|The Punisher]] fought Mandrill and injured his eye.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 14|15}}

Mandrill was among the animal-themed superhumans captured by [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady (LMD) (Earth-616)|Black Ant]] for [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter's]]'s Great Hunt sponsored by [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]]'s company [[Arcade Industries (Earth-616)|Arcade Industries]]. Mandrill was mentioned by Spider-Man as one of the many deaths during the The Great Hunt.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 19}}

<!-- Hood and his gang of criminals interrogated a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, asking him to tell them everything he knew about [[Skrulls]].{{r|New Avengers #46}}{{r|New Avengers #50}} He remained with the gang as they teamed up with the [[Dark Avengers]] to battle the Avengers.{{r|Marvel Zombies 4 #2}}{{r|New Avengers #55}}{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #26}}{{r|Dark Reign: The Hood #4}}{{r|New Avengers #56}}{{r|New Avengers #57}}

| Powers                  = * The Mandrill is a [[Homo superior|Mutant]] and possesses a number of superhuman attributes.
**'''''[[Mind Control via Pheromones]]:''''' The Mandrill's primary mutant power is the ability to secrete an odorless pheromone capable of affecting human females, leaving them extremely submissive and open to the Mandrill's manipulations. The pheromones have a maximum effective range of 250 feet and are highly addictive. Initial contact with Mandrill and subsequent reinforcement over a period of a few months is sufficient to keep most women in his power almost permanently. If, however, the woman is removed from his presence after the initial contact, she will go through a mild period of "withdrawal" and be free after a period of a few months. The Mandrill's mutant pheromones are released at a rate of 2,000 parts per million, several thousand times that of a normal human.
** '''Superhuman Strength:''' Due to his simian physique, the Mandrill possesses the proportionate physical strength of an actual 270 pound Mandrill. At his peak, the Mandrill possesses low level superhuman strength sufficient to lift approximately 2,700 lbs.
**'''Superhuman Speed:''' The Mandrill can run and move at speeds that are slightly beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete. At short sprints, he can reach speeds of up to 40 miles per hour.
**'''Superhuman Stamina:''' The Mandrill's superior musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of a normal human. At his peak, he can exert himself for a period of several hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him.
**'''Superhuman Durability:''' The Mandrill's bodily tissues are harder and more resistant to certain kinds of injury than those of a normal human, though he is far from invulnerable. The Mandrill's body can withstand great impact forces. He can withstand impacts, such as falling from several stories or being repeatedly struck by a superhumanly strong opponent, that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury to himself. However, he can be injured by bullets or bladed weapons composed of conventional material as easily as normal humans.
**'''Superhuman Agility:''' The Mandrill had the agility, balance, and bodily coordination of a great ape. His agility is beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.
** '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' The Mandrill's reflexes are similarly enhanced and are superior to those of the finest human athlete.

| Abilities               = Although the Mandrill has had no formal training, his powers make him a formidable hand to hand combatant in most situations. He uses a freestyle type of fighting that allows him to make full use of his agility.
| Strength                = 
| Weaknesses              = If a woman under his thrall suffers a powerful electric shock, it often negates the effects of the Mandrill's pheromones. Exceptionally strong willed women, such as Shanna and the Black Widow, have proven capable of resisting the pheromones in the past. There is at least one occasion, however, in which the Black Widow was completely under the Mandrill's control.
