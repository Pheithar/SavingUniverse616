===Origin===
Maddy's powers first occurred after an embarrassing incident at her high school. [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] later asked her to join the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]]. Maddy agreed, not knowing Osborn's evil intentions, and signed up.{{r|Avengers Academy #1}}

After months of experimenting they managed to duplicate the event that turned Maddy to gas, though the experimentation was very traumatic to her. After Osborn was taken down, [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]] took up her case and determined the limits of her powers and the effects of Osborn's experimentation. Because Osborn forced her body to undergo such drastic changes before she was ready she was slowly dissipating and would one day completely disappear.{{r|Avengers Academy #1}}

===Avengers Academy=== 
Maddy is then recruited to join the newly formed [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]] alongside other young potential heroes [[Ken Mack (Earth-616)|Mettle (Ken Mack)]], [[Brandon Sharpe (Earth-616)|Striker (Brandon Sharpe)]], [[Jeanne Foucault (Earth-616)|Finesse (Jeanne Foucault)]], [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-616)|Reptil (Humberto Lopez)]], and [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat (Jennifer Takeda)]]. As soon as Maddy, now calling herself Veil, was dressed in her new costume, she walked in on trainees Reptil and Mettle. She panicked upon seeing the latter's face and dissipated, before reforming herself. She was then properly introduced to her other classmates, Finesse and Striker. She, and the rest of the class were lead to believe they were among those most likely to become heroes, but they quickly uncovered files on them revealed they were most likely to become villains.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 1}}

===Fear Itself===
In [[Washington, D.C.]], the Avengers Academy students were busy evacuating civilians through the dimensional doors. Veil noticed one girl standing idly by and pushed her out of the way of falling rubble. Veil survived by turning into gas. She then approached the girl, asking where her mother was. When pointed in the right direction, Veil went searching beneath the debris and found the girl's mother and revived her. But as soon as she freed her from the rubble, the mother was shot down by the [[Thule Society (Earth-616)|Thule Society]] mechs. Enraged, Veil turned into gaseous form and killed the drivers. She then turned to an approaching medic, advising him to take care of the girl. Veil then reflected on her failure to save the mother.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 16}}

When the [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]] attacked the [[Infinite Avengers Mansion]], Veil was knocked unconscious along with Mettle and Reptil; leaving Hazmat, Finesse, and Striker to hold off them off. However their instructors arrived and saved them just in time. She later told the team she was quitting because she was fed up living in a war zone and being put in a position where the students are forced to sacrifice their lives. She began working for [[Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616)|Jeremy Briggs]] at [[Briggs Chemical LLC (Earth-616)|Briggs Chemical LLC]].{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 20}}

===Final Exam===
Hazmat received a call from Briggs, saying he had found a cure. Mettle and Hazmat were joined by [[Julie Power (Earth-616)|Lightspeed]], Striker, Finesse, and [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]]. Veil revealed to the students that she had been cured with [[Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616)|Alchemist]]'s new invention "Clean Slate". Mettle and Hazmat took the cure, and than Jeremy revealed his true intentions: to extract each superhuman's power from them to regift them only to the people who would use them properly. [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]] tried to stop him, but Briggs switched her body to a locked office. After defeating the depowered Reptil, [[Ava Ayala (Earth-616)|White Tiger]], Lightspeed, Finesse, and X-23, Briggs extended his offer to Mettle, Hazmat, Striker, and Veil who accepted.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 34}}

Jeremy Briggs however revealed his true plan to Veil and Striker. He planned to remove all superpowered beings' powers, only allowing the worthy to possess them. Veil ran to tell Mettle and Hazmat and persuade them to take the so-called antidote and restore their powers for good. Mettle and the group confronted Jeremy and his accomplice the [[Sylvie Lushton (Earth-616)|Enchantress (Sylvie Lushton)]] on the rooftop of the building.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 35}} 

White Tiger and Reptil drew on the full power of their magic, gaining an extreme upper hand on the Enchantress. Sensing her defeat she teleported away but not before getting her face slashed by White Tiger.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 36}} X-23 did some slicing and dicing of Briggs, so he released an acid attack on her stomach, destroying it in the process. Finesse noticed this as the perfect opportunity to use X-23's hands as weapons. Finesse grabbed X-23's wrists, and stabbed two of Briggs' most important arteries. As he sat there bleeding to death, he freaked out, and Finesse started to stem the loss of blood by cutting off the flow. Finesse reminded Briggs about why they were recruited, that they were at risk of being villains. As she said this, she untied the cloth that had been keeping Briggs from bleeding to death, and walked off as he died.

In the aftermath, Hazmat told Mettle that killing Briggs was completely worth it, and that she had no remorse.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 37}} 

Now de-powered and without fear of dissipation, Maddy left the Avengers Academy, returning to her normal life as a human once again.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 37}}
