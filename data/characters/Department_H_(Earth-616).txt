| History                 = Department H is a branch of the Canadian government that sanctioned, supported, and monitored all the superhuman activity in [[Canada]]. It also oversaw the superhuman team [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]].

[[Parliament Hill]] created Department H as a research and development program under the umbrella of the Ministry of Defense, and selected [[James Hudson (Earth-616)|James Hudson]] to act as the department's administrator. During this time, he met [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]. When James Hudson saw a newspaper article of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] having been formed in the United States, he decided to form a defensive response team for Canada.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 3}} When the [[Flight (Earth-616)|Flight]] became Alpha Flight, Wolverine joined up with them amongst others.{{r|Wolverine: First Class Vol 1 5}}

Department H sent James Hudson in his Weapon Alpha suit to capture Wolverine and bring him back to Canada. When James Hudson found Wolverine hunting a deer, he reminded Wolverine that he was still the property of the Canadian government.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 109}}

In the next attempt to reclaim Wolverine, James Hudson as Vindicator led Alpha Flight to down the [[X-Jet]], forcing it to land using a blizzard summoned by [[Michael Twoyoungmen (Earth-616)|Shaman]]. Alpha Flight managed to capture Wolverine and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]]. Following a fight between the X-Men and Alpha Flight, Wolverine decided to surrender himself to Alpha Flight and Department H. Yet Wolverine managed to escape from Department H and reunite with the X-Men on the X-Jet.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 121}}

Department H unofficially sent [[Walter Langkowski (Earth-616)|Sasquatch]], [[Jeanne-Marie Beaubier (Earth-616)|Aurora]], and [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]] to the United States to detain [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]] after seeing the footage where they thought he defeated [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]].{{r|Machine Man Vol 1 18}}

[[File:Alpha Flight Vol 1 1 001.JPG|thumb|left|James Hudson muses on the first closing of Department H]]
The Department was shut down due to operating costs, forcing the disbandment of Alpha Flight.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 1}} Some time later, the decision was reversed, to a degree, with the Department being re-established solely as an organization to support Alpha Flight.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 29}}

Department H sent [[Omega Flight (Heroes) (Earth-616)|Omega Flight]] (consisting of [[Validator (Earth-616)|Validator]], [[Boxx (Earth-616)|Boxx]], [[Kingdom (Earth-616)|Kingdom]], and a [[Wendigo (Omega Flight) (Earth-616)|Wendigo]]) to investigate one of the Origin Bomb sites left by [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]] in Regina, Canada. Validator was changed by the Origin Bomb site while the rest of the Omega Flight members were killed in action by the hostile organisms.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 10}}
