===Origins===
After rescuing [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Laurie]], [[Gabriel Cohuelo (Earth-616)|Gabriel]], and [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie]]; [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]], [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], and [[Lights (Earth-616)|the Lights]] traveled to the [[Ukraine]] to find the next light. However, when they arrived in [[Kyiv]], he was gone. They tracked him over most of [[Europe]] and finally found him in [[Miami Beach]], [[Florida (State)|Florida]]. Like the other Lights, Hope stabilized Teon's powers with her touch, but unlike the others she also "tamed" him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 529}} After Teon joined her team, the group set off for [[Japan]] to stop the [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|fifth light]] from destroying [[Tokyo]].{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 1|4}}
[[File:Teon Macik (Earth-616) sparring James Howlett (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Teon sparring with [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].]]

===The Five Lights===
In [[Tokyo]], Teon continued to show great loyalty to Hope. When Teon met [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], he instantly viewed him as a foe.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 1|4}} Once on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], Wolverine and Teon sparred. Although Teon was able to hold his own, he was eventually bested by Wolverine.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 4}} Their sparring sessions continued.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 6}} Like the other Lights, [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Doctor Nemesis]] performed tests on Teon to discover some of the nature and limits of his new powers.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 4}}

Teon willingly followed Hope and accompanied the Lights to [[Berlin]] on their first mission to find a [[Sixth Light (Earth-616)|new mutant]]. It was discovered that Teon had some limited telepathic shields, and proved immune to the Sixth Light's psychic powers. He was the only team member who was able to persuade the boy to be born.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 6|7}}

After that, the Lights returned to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], as his parents were suing the X-Men to get their son home. However, Teon convinced his parents that he had changed, "sprouted" from the child they knew, and together with the Lights he was much happier then ever. His parents then returned to Ukraine, leaving Teon in the custody of the X-Men.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 8}}

===Schism & Regenesis===
After the attack launched by [[Kade Kilgore (Earth-616)|Kade Kilgore]] and his [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]], the X-Men fractured into two groups: Cyclops' group who stayed on Utopia and Wolverine's who planned to restart the school as the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey Institute for Higher Learning]]. Teon decided to remain on Utopia with the other Lights except [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie]], who left with Wolverine's group. Teon later joined the remaining Lights in a scrimmage battle between them and the [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. The team was however defeated and had to leave to get their wounds treated. During that time Teon attempted to mate with the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]].

The group soon were called on a mission to search for a new light in [[Pakistan]], which turned out to be the mind wiped [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]] who was being used by terrorist as a human bomb.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 13}} After rescuing Shaw and recruiting him to the team they returned to Utopia, where they had to confront Cyclops and Emma.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 14}}

The team later had to face their own teammate Kenji who was plotting to kill Hope. The battle soon ended when [[Martha Johansson (Earth-616)|No-Girl]] used her telepathic powers to kill Kenji.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 17}}

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
When the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] arrived enforce on Utopia to take Hope into custody before the arrival of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]], Cyclops and the X-Men forcibly tried to stop them. During the melee, Hope escaped, but the Lights and young X-Men were left behind as Cyclops and many of his X-Men fled. Not wanting the younger X-Men to join the war, the Avengers decided to quarantine them at the [[Avengers Compound]] with the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]].{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 29}} However, the teenage mutants didn't want to remain in custody, and were eventually allowed to leave.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 30|31}} The Lights returned to Utopia in search of Hope,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 13}} but when they couldn't find her they joined the other young mutants in [[Westchester County|Westchester]] at [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School For Higher Learning]].{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men Vol 1 15}}

[[File:Lights (Earth-616) from Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 15 0001.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Oya showing her old teammates around the new school]]
The Lights were functionally disbanded with the departure of Hope and the enrollment of Teon and the remaining members into the Jean Grey School.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men Vol 1 15}}

===Age of X-Man===
When [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]] tried to impose his vision of the world, the X-Men opposed him. Believing that the X-Men were only making things worse in the world, Nate made them vanish in an instant, including Teon.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 10}}

Teon and the others were transported to a [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|reality]] created by Nate and a [[Life Seed]] where he tried to create a utopia where mutants could live in peace. Nate erased the memories of those he trapped there so they didn't resist.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}

Teon became one of the students who were part of the Civil Management Division at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Summers Institute for Higher Learning]]. He along with [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]] and [[Megan Gwynn (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Pixie]] were attending [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Professor Yoshida]]'s class where [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Clerk Psylocke]] was providing a lecture on [[Department X (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Department X]].{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 1}}

Teon returned to the real world when Nate decided to allow the mutants he trapped in his reality to leave after realizing the flaws in his approach to his reality.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}} Teon became a citizen of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] and was shown hanging out with other mutants at the [[Green Lagoon]]. {{r|X-Force Vol 6 9}}

| Powers                  = {{Quote|I am the pursuit of happiness embodied.|[[Teon Macik (Earth-616)|Primal]]|Generation Hope Vol 1 8}} Teon is one of post-[[Decimation|M-Day]] [[Homo superior|mutant]] activations. His feral powers include:
'''Feral Mind''': Teon is much more animalistic in his habits and behaviors. He can still parse complex ideas, but does not in favor of utilizing a simplistic view of his world. An example, Teon sees the people around him as potential threats ("flight"), foes ("fight"), or lovers ("mate").
* '''Hyper-instincts''': He is able to find solutions to any of civilization's problems that he faces given the right motivation. Place him near a fridge he will eat what will keep him alive and most likely stay in top physical form. Place him in a court room and he will develop the intellect and eloquence to win a trial.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 8}}
* '''Psionic Shields:''' Teon's animalistic mind seems to possess a natural defense against [[Telepathy|telepathic]] reading or attack.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 6}}

'''Enhanced Strength'''<br>
'''Enhanced Speed''' and '''Reflexes'''<br>
'''Enhanced Senses'''<br> 
'''Enhanced Stamina'''<br> 
'''Enhanced Agility'''<br>
'''Enhanced Healing'''<br>
'''Enhanced Durability'''

That status of post-[[M-Day]] activated mutant gave him also the following characteristic:
* '''Lights Bonding:''' The Lights were shown to be linked to each other, to [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]], and to the new activations, with some low level control from Hope over them. They were also affected by the suicide of [[Zeeshan (Earth-616)|Zeeshan]].{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 9}} That situation was witnessed by [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Transonic]] and [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Zero]],{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 8}} and later by [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]].{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 12}} Also, when the [[Sixth Light (Earth-616)|Sixth Light]] activated, all of the Lights were able to sense it.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 6}}
| Abilities               = * Teon's powers allow him to instantly master fields: Shooting,{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 5}} rhetoric,{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 8}} ...
* He also trained with [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] on a few occasions at least.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 539}}

| Notes                   = 
* The only person Teon obeys is [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]], whom he recognizes as "Master".
* Creators [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Kieron Gillen]] loosely based the [[Lights (Earth-616)|Five Lights]] mutant powers on the the archetypal power-sets on the original five [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] (with the exception of [[Gabriel Cohuelo (Earth-616)|Gabriel]]).<ref>[https://www.cbr.com/x-position-kieron-gillen-3/ X-POSITION: Kieron Gillen]</ref>

* Teon's surname at first seemed to be the point of some confusion. Teon's surname was identified in promotional material as '''''Savko''''', a name also accidentally used in {{cl|Heroic Age: X-Men Vol 1 1}}. However, his actual surname has been recently confirmed as '''''Macik'''''.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 6}}
