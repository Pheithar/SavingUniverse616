| History                 = Elsbeth von Strucker was the wife of [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi]] criminal [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]]. A devout Satanist and social nihilist, she helped Strucker fund the foundation of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], but was unknown to [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] for almost the whole of her life. According to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s research, she was stated to be the 4th richest person in the world, 175 years old, a chess grandmaster, the lover of the four kings and three presidents (among others), and a close personal friend of the late [[Helena Blavatsky (Earth-616)|Madame Blavatsky]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 23}}

Based on political machinations presaging a regime change within Hydra, Elsbeth entered the chain of command, forming a personal and sexual alliance with the [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]]. Together, the two led a merger of the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] and Hydra on a campaign which was intended to destroy civilization and the planet Earth. They also created a [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Clone) (Earth-616)|clone]] of Baron Strucker who posed as the original in a ritual suicide when he abdicate power to them.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 23|25}}{{r|New Thunderbolts Vol 1 17}}

However, their scheme was foiled by Wolverine, who killed Elsbeth by firing a rocket-propelled grenade into her bedroom with Gorgon.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 30}}
