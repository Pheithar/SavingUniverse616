===Origin===
'''Tanya Sealy''' was born in [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]]. She worked as a call girl for some time until she was chosen by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon Oil Company]] to partake in a covert operation to retrieve the mystical [[Serpent Crown]]. The executives at Roxxon surgically implanted a special component in her brain which enables her slight telepathic abilities. Under unknown circumstances, she also gained the ability to project a cloud of energy known as [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]]. She most often uses her combined abilities to use the image of her opponent's loved one and suffocate them with the darkforce projection. As part of her first mission, she was assigned to work with other snake-themed villains [[Seth Voelker (Earth-616)|Sidewinder]], [[Blanche Sitznski (Earth-616)|Anaconda]], and [[Roland Burroughs (Earth-616)|Death Adder]] as part of the [[Serpent Squad (Roxxon Oil) (Earth-616)|Serpent Squad]]. Their search for the Serpent Crown put them in conflict with the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]], [[Walter Newell (Earth-616)|Stingray]], and [[Triton (Earth-616)|Triton]]. The Serpent Squad found the crown, but Sidewinder accidentally trapped Black Mamba, Anaconda, and Death Adder underwater.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #64|65}}

Anaconda managed to free herself and her teammates, and the trio plotted to steal a weapon simply known as the microscanner from [[Stark Enterprises (Earth-616)|Stark Enterprises]]. [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] discovered their plan and defeated the Serpent Squad.{{r|Iron Man #160}}

Black Mamba, Anaconda, and Death Adder then sought out Sidewinder for revenge for abandoning them during their first mission.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 307}} However, when confronted, Sidewinder gave the trio their earnings from the Serpent Crown mission and proposed a way for them to earn far more money as long as they'd put aside their desire for revenge and listen to his pitch. Black Mamba, Anaconda, and Death Adder agreed to attend Sidewinder's gathering of serpent-themed criminals.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 308}}

===Serpent Society===
Sidewinder's proposal of a criminal union that provides health care, pensions, camaraderie, and the promise to never face long-term prison time proved appealing to Black Mamba, and she accepted the invitation to join the [[Serpent Society (Earth-616)|Serpent Society]].{{r|Captain America Vol 1 310}}

One of her earliest missions partnered Black Mamba with the [[Gustav Krueger (Earth-616)|Rattler]] as they investigated an underwater [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] facility. Their mission was cut short when Sidewinder ordered them to a shopping mall in [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]] to hunt down [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]], who had betrayed A.I.M. At the mall, [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] ambushed the Serpent Society, with Black Mamba assisting [[Cleopatra Nefertiti (Earth-616)|Asp]] and [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]] in attempt to stop him. Black Mamba began creating a darkforce phantom of Captain America's lover [[Bernadette Rosenthal (Earth-616)|Bernie Rosenthal]], but was knocked unconscious when Asp blasted the phantom while it was still connected to her. Nevertheless, Death Adder and [[Burchell Clemens (Earth-616)|Cottonmouth]] managed killing blows on their target.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 313}} Shortly after, Black Mamba joined Anaconda, Asp, and [[Klaus Voorhees (Earth-616)|Cobra]] as they retrieved M.O.D.O.K.'s corpse from the morgue and delivered it to A.I.M.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 315}}

After Death Adder's murder, Black Mamba revealed his death to his parents and asked if their son had any enemies that they knew of.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 319}}

When the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] assaulted the [[Avengers Mansion, Inc. (Earth-616)|Avengers Mansion]], Black Mamba was hired by [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Helmut Zemo]] to seduce and drug [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 274}}

Around this time, Black Mamba began a romantic relationship with Sidewinder. When [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]] infiltrated the organization, she shot and stunned Black Mamba. Dressed in Black Mamba's maid disguise, Viper attempted to poison and kill Sidewinder, though he managed to escape. The captive Black Mamba remained loyal to her lover, so Viper injected poison into her veins. Diamondback, who had contacted Captain America for help, found Mamba, Asp, and [[Quincy McIver (Earth-616)|Bushmaster]], the only members who had stayed loyal to Sidewinder, and administered the anti-toxin to save their lives.{{r|Captain America #341|344}}

After Cobra claimed leadership of the Serpent Society, the organization was hired to seek out mystical items. Black Mamba was joined by Anaconda, [[Beatrix Keener (Earth-616)|Coachwhip]], and [[M'Gula (Earth-616)|Rock Python]] as they searched for a Native American totem. The [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] interrupted their mission, and Black Mamba used the illusion of [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Lorna Dane]] in attempt to smother [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]]. Havok managed to overcome the darkforce phantasm and defeat Black Mamba.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 13}}

Over the years with the Serpent Society, Black Mamba became close friends with Diamondback and Asp.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 368}} With Anaconda, the women helped Diamondback's date with Captain America (unbeknownst to the others at the time) go smoothly.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 371}} When the Serpent Society learned that Diamondback had been dating their arch-rival, they held a vote over whether to punish Diamondback for treason. Black Mamba was one of the few members to vote against the death penalty. Diamondback was ultimately sentenced to death. Black Mamba, wishing to save her friend, contacted Sidewinder and had him teleport the captive Diamondback to safety. However, King Cobra learned of this and captured Black Mamba and Asp. They were quickly freed by Captain America and allowed to remain at large at Diamondback's request.{{r|Captain America #380|382}}

===B.A.D. Girls and Femizons===
With Diamondback ousted from the Serpent Society and the majority of its members in prison, Black Mamba joined her friends in forming [[B.A.D. Girls, Inc. (Earth-616)|B.A.D. Girls, Inc.]]. They acquired new costumes and planned to work as freelance mercenaries. Soon after, Anaconda, Rock Python, and [[Gordon Fraley (Earth-616)|Puff Adder]], all of whom avoided arrest, found and attacked the trio by crashing their [[Serpent Saucer]] into [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]]'s apartment. Black Mamba was buried under the rubble of the building. Her unconscious body, along with Asp and Diamondback, were taken aboard the Serpent Saucer. While flying away, [[Olinka Barankova (Earth-616)|M.O.D.A.M.]] appeared and threw Puff Adder and Rock Python from the saucer. She invited Black Mamba, Asp, Diamondback, and Anaconda to join [[Deidre Wentworth (Earth-616)|Superia]]'s all-female band of criminals, the [[Femizons (Earth-616)|Femizons]]. Black Mamba and her allies reluctantly agreed to join the group.{{r|Captain America #385|387}}

While aboard Superia's cruise ship, the B.A.D. Girls befriended [[Impala (Earth-616)|Impala]]. When a fight broke out between Anaconda and [[Quicksand (Nguyet) (Earth-616)|Quicksand]], Black Mamba cheered on Anaconda. While distracted, Black Mamba didn't notice a figure grabbing Diamondback.{{r|Captain America #388}}

Black Mamba and Asp later found Diamondback in the infirmary, having been thrown overboard and left for dead. Traumatized, Diamondback told her teammates that she planned to retire.{{r|Captain America #389}} Soon after, Black Mamba and Asp discovered that Captain America and Paladin had slipped aboard the S.S. Superia.{{r|Captain America #390}}

After finding out Superia's plans to transform all male human life into women, Black Mamba realized they needed to free Captain America as she didn't want to live in a world without men. She and Asp rescued Captain America and Paladin and disguised themselves as guards, while the two men donned Mamba's and Asp's B.A.D. Girls costumes. Black Mamba joined Captain America as they searched for Superia. In the ensuing battle, Mamba attempted to use her darkforce on the villainess, but Superia quickly knocked her out.{{r|Captain America #391}} When she recovered, she found Captain America outmatched by a group of Femizons. She assisted him against [[Philippa Sontag (Earth-616)|Arclight]], and later joined Captain America, Asp, Diamondback, and Paladin at the docks as they were rescued by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Captain America #392}}

===Modeling Career===
For a brief period of time, Black Mamba lived in [[Hollywood]] and worked as a fashion model. When Puff Adder approached her and asked for her to return to the Serpent Society, she refused and told him she made more money as a model.{{r|Deathlok Vol 2 7}}

===Masters of Evil VII===
Under unknown circumstances, Black Mamba abandoned her modeling career and served in [[Justine Hammer (Earth-616)|Crimson Cowl]]'s Masters of Evil as they battled the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]].{{r|Thunderbolts #64|71}}

===Returning to B.A.D. Girls===
She eventually returned to the Serpent Society for a brief time{{r|Captain America Vol 4 30|31}}, and then once again left to be with Diamondback and Asp and continue their operations as the B.A.D. Girls. During one mission, to find the "Dominus Objective," Black Mamba severely embarrassed [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] when she revealed his darkest fantasy -- to be given a back massage by his partner in crime, [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] (although her power similarly affected everyone she used it on in this appearance). She also fought [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] and [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], and was shocked to realize her group had been hired by Cable himself.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #20|22}}

===Civil War===
During the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], Black Mamba appeared along with her friends Diamondback and Asp as a member of Captain America's anti-registration group, the [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]].{{r|Civil War #5}}

===[[Dark Reign]]===
She later joined the [[Women Warriors (Earth-616)|Women Warriors]], a female team part of the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] as the [[Delaware (State)|Delaware]] team.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #26}}

The Women Warriors, along with [[Frank Payne (Earth-616)|Constrictor]], confronted [[Radically Advanced Ideas in Destruction (Earth-616)|R.A.I.D.]],{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #29}} and later participated to [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Osborn]]'s attack on [[Asgard]].{{r|Siege Vol 1 1}}

===Assassins Guild===
Following the Dark Reign, Black Mamba apparently became an independent assassin, being hired by the [[Assassins Guild (Earth-616)|Assassins Guild]] in their battle with [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]]. She fought against [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]], who shot her in the shoulder. Later, she attacked [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] who stabbed her in the chest, seemingly fatally wounding her. Despite being on the brink of death, she was healed by [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]].{{r|X-Force: Sex and Violence Vol 1 3}}

The Assassin's Guild later hired Black Mamba, alongside her former Serpent Squad teammates (with [[Theodore Scott (Earth-616)|Theodore Scott]] replacing Roland Burroughs as Death Adder), to hunt down and kill [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]], [[Cape Crow (Earth-616)|Cape Crow]], [[Kento Roe (Earth-616)|Kento Roe]], and [[Matchmaker (Earth-616)|Matchmaker]].{{r|Elektra Vol 4 6}}

===Serpent Solutions===
When [[Jordan Dixon (Earth-616)|Viper]] took over leadership of the Serpent Society and rebranded it as Serpent Solutions, Black Mamba once again rejoined the organization.{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson Vol 1 4}} 

Alongside Anaconda, Asp, [[Zelda DuBois (Earth-616)|Princess Python]], [[Teresa Vasquez (Earth-616)|Fer-de-Lance]], and [[Ariana Saddiqi (Earth-616)|Black Racer]], Black Mamba burst from a giant cake during the Thing's bachelor party. The female members of Serpent Solutions battled the superheroes in attendance, but were eventually defeated and taken into custody.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 5}}

===Hunted===
Black Mamba was among several animal-themed super-villains captured by [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady (LMD) (Earth-616)|Black Ant]] to serve as hunting targets in [[Central Park]] for a host of wealthy participants controlling robotic drones, part of a plot [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]] and [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] concocted.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 16|17}} Banded together with the other super-villains, Black Mamba supported the idea of [[Adrian Toomes (Earth-616)|Vulture]] leading them to battle the drones.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 19}} The group soon ambushed several drones, revealing that damaging them injures the user, which Kraven had planned for all along.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 20}}

When the force field keeping the criminals inside Central Park dissipated, several superheroes attacked and apprehended Black Mamba and the other escaped villains.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 23}}

Later, Black Mamba was hired by the Cynadine Oil Company to guard their facility in the Northwest Territories. When [[Lin Li (Earth-616)|Nature Girl]] and [[Curse (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Curse]], two young mutants who left [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], attacked the facility, Black Mamba attacked Nature Girl. She threatened to use her darkforce on the pair unless they fled.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Infinity Comic Vol 1 8}} When they refused to leave, Black Mamba used her powers to hypnotize Curse while she battled Nature Girl with martial arts. She eventually used her darkforce illusions on Nature Girl, who managed to overcome the darkforce. When the Oil Company guards regrouped around Black Mamba, she ordered the young mutants to surrender. Suddenly, [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]] flew to the Oil Company in search of revenge for his destroyed laboratory.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Infinity Comic Vol 1 9}}

| Powers                  = 

* {{Darkforce}} Black Mamba possesses the ability to project an inky cloud of extradimensional energy known as the Darkforce. This energy is manifested by Black Mamba as a limited quantity of viscous semi-solid matter. It is not known how far Black Mamba can project this energy manifestation, but her control over it seems limited by her line of sight. It is also not known how much of it she can manipulate at once: so far she has not been observed using it against more than one person at a time. Black Mamba uses the [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]] (a process she refers to as "shedding her skin") to surround, constrict, and suffocate her opponents. The maximum amount of pressure she can generate through her Darkforce-projection is not known. However, the superhumanly strong Thing seemed unable to break its grip when he was encompassed by it. During the Superia crisis, after a suggestion by Captain America, Black Mamba discovered that she could surround herself (or someone else if they remained within her line of sight) with a cloud of darkforce, she could alter its appearance to disguise herself as someone else. 

* {{Hypnosis}} Black Mamba also possesses some form of hypnotic ability, enabling her to mesmerize her opponents into perceiving her Darkforce projection in the image of someone they love or trust. It is not known how irresistible this ability is, but the Thing, Iron Man, and Captain America have proven susceptible to it. As part of the hypnotic illusion, her opponent imagines him or herself in the embrace of his or her self-chosen loved one, and the implausibility of the loved one's sudden materialization and provocative behavior is overwhelmed by the sensation of euphoria she triggers in most human brains, if one remains in the grip of her illusory Darkforce projection for too long, he or she will succumb to suffocation. The amount of time this takes varies according to the stamina and breath control of her opponent. The victim dies, however, overwhelmed by ecstasy. Black Mamba may need to be within line of sight of her opponent not to direct the Darkforce, but to use it in conjunction with her hypnotic power.

| Abilities               = She is capable aircraft pilot and a decent hand to hand combatant. It's also shown that she can breathe underwater.
| Strength                = Black Mamba possesses the normal human strength of a woman of her age, height, and build who engages in moderate regular exercise.

| Weaknesses              = Besides those limits to her power described above, Black Mamba needs to concentrate in order to project her "snake-skin." Also, if her Darkforce projection is bombarded with certain powerful energies she will feel the force of that disruption against her body. This feedback effect may cause her pain or the loss of consciousness.
