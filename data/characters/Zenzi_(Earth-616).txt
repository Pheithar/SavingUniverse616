Zenzi became the leader of the Nigandan Army, and allied herself with [[Tetu (Earth-616)|Tetu]], the head of the [[Wakanda|Wakandan]] rebel movement known as [[People (Earth-616)|the People]], and used her abilities to incite riots.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 1}}

The [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] tracked her down two times. The first time, in the Nigandan Border Region, Zenzi made her escape while the Black Panther fell prey to her abilities.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 2}} The second time, Black Panther and his [[Hatut Zeraze (Earth-616)|Hatut Zeraze]] ambushed Zenzi, Tetu and several Nigandan soldiers in Southwest Wakanda. During the scuffle, Black Panther knocked out Zenzi, causing her to slip into a coma.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 3}} Tetu retreated with her and managed to wake her up several days later.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 4}}

Zenzi helped Tetu establish friendly terms with a coexisting rebel force, the [[Dora Milaje (Earth-616)|Dora Milaje]], by using her powers to thwart an attack of Black Panther's [[Hatut Zeraze (Earth-616)|Hatut Zeraze]].{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 6}} Zenzi later used her abilities to empower the members of the Nigandian Army and have them march towards the [[Birnin Zana (Earth)|Golden City]] in their final act to overthrow Black Panther.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 9}}

When the People approached the Golden City, Black Panther had old scholar [[Changamire (Earth-616)|Changamire]] speak out against Tetu and broadcast it through the [[Kimoyo Beads]]. His speech moved countless members of the People's army, which in turn caused the effect of freeing them from Zenzi's grasp. Tetu had her use those few who remained on their side to murder the would-be defectors. She then empowered the remaining soldiers, turning them into mindless brutes that managed to break into the Golden City.

Zenzi remained behind the People's forces, so she was not captured when Tetu and his soldiers fell at the hands of Black Panther and his allies, and instead observed from a distance as her enterprise collapsed.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 11}} Zenzi retreated towards the wilderness through Birnin Zana and met up with two of the People's allies, [[Ezekiel Stane (Earth-616)|Zeke Stane]] and [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]], and teleported away with them.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 12}}

Zenzi later joined forces with [[Johann Fennhoff (Earth-616)|Doctor Faustus]]{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 14}} and helped him and [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] take control of the minds of Wakanda's soldiers so [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] could force Black Panther to hand over the Cosmic Cube fragment he had hidden away.{{r|Captain America Vol 8 25}}

Zenzi was later recruited by [[Bast (Earth-616)|Bast]] to help the weakened goddess retake her power, which had been stolen by [[N'Jadaka (Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda) (Earth-616)|Emperor N'Jadaka]], and after doing so became the goddess' new host.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 25}}

| Powers                  = '''[[Empathy (Power)|Empathic Enliftment/Manipulation:]]''' Zenzi possesses the ability to read and control the emotions of others on a large scale. She is able to lift the emotional veil and reveal their deeper, truer selves and bring it to the surface.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 1}} She can also use her powers to push the limits of the human body, allowing the soldiers of the People under her influence to march day and night without rest.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 10}} At their maximum potential, Zenzi's powers are capable of turning people into mindless beasts with enhanced speed, strength and durability.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 11}}
