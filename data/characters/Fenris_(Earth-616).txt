===Origin===
The Strucker Twins  [[Andreas von Strucker (Earth-616)|Andreas von Strucker]] and [[Andrea von Strucker (Earth-616)|Andrea von Strucker]] were the children of Nazi supremacist [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]], who saw great potential in their future.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 194}} While still in-utero, the children were bio-engineered by [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Dr. Arnim Zola]] to have superpowers, using the [[X-Gene]] with each gaining the ability to fly and fire beams of concentrated plasma as long as they were in physical contact, usually accomplished by holding hands.{{r|X-Men: Phoenix Force Handbook Vol 1 1}} 

===Fenris Twins===
Now known as the Fenris Twins, like their father, the twins are white supremacists, have great sympathy for the Nazi agenda, and strive for the Fourth Reich. The two came into conflict with the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. While on safari, [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] interrupted Andreas' attempted assault on a native woman in Africa.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #194}} Andrea retaliated for Storm's humiliation of her brother by shooting her in the head and leaving her to die.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #196}}

The Strucker twins despise [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] for his role in their father's seeming death some years after World War II. They conducted acts of terrorism and finally attacked Magneto during his trial in Paris by the International Court of Justice for his crimes against humanity. The X-Men foiled their assassination attempt, but Fenris managed to escape by allowing themselves to be swept into the old city sewers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #200}} 

===Assembly of Evil===
[[File:Fenris (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 1 32 006.jpg|thumb|276px]]
The twins joined the [[Assembly of Evil (Earth-616)|Assembly of Evil]]. The Assembly confronted a small contingent of Avengers who were holding a press conference regarding the "[[Acts of Vengeance (Event)|Acts of Vengeance]]."{{r|Mutant Misadventures of Cloak and Dagger Vol 1 8}} The Avengers defeated the Assembly with the help of [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] and [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]], who had only agreed to join the villains so they could foil their plans. The Assembly was remanded to custody and the various members have never since banded together again.{{r|Mutant Misadventures of Cloak and Dagger Vol 1 9}}

===Madripoor===
At a certain point, the twins were informed by Moira MacTaggert (possessed by the Shadow King) that Forge and Banshee wanted to search and reunite the ''defunct'' X-Men. They explode their plane, injuring only the pilot, Cylla Markham, later recruited by Donald Pierce.
Fenris living in [[Madripoor]] met with [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba (Earth-616)|Matsu'o Tsurayaba]], the new leader of the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]]. [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] was sent to investigate the meeting taking place on a yacht docked at the harbor. Working with [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] they infiltrated the yacht and take out the gangsters, but find out they are impostors: the real meeting took place somewhere else in the meantime.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 268}}

===Excalibur===
The twins traveled to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] where they blackmailed [[Mesmero (Vincent) (Earth-616)|Mesmero]] into using his powers for them. He took control of [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] to attack Fenris. [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] was training as a cheerleader close by and left in the middle of the routine to help her team. After some debating, the other girls decided to help and used their hockey sticks that take out Fenris.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 34}}

===Crime Lords===
The twins joined a conference of powerful criminal leaders who intended to divide up the empire left by the fallen Kingpin.{{r|Nomad Vol 2 5}} Among the members of the conference were [[Ulysses Lugman (Earth-616)|Slug]], [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]], [[Lonnie Lincoln (Earth-616)|Tombstone]] and their sibling [[Werner von Strucker]]. The twins did not believe Werner was actually their sibling.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 #308|309}} This, and other arguments, caused the conference to degenerate into a shouting, shooting and blasting match. Fenris attempted to kill Hammerhead but he was rescued. Their sibling is soon after killed by their father, who had attended the conference disguised as the assistant to Werner.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 47}}

They fought Citizen V, though Andrea discovers that he is actually Baron Helmut Zemo.{{r|Citizen V and the V-Battalion Vol 1 #1|2}} Having been decapitated by Scourge under orders of Henry Peter Gyrich, Zemo had survived when Techno, to Zemo's own surprise, transferred Zemo's mind into the comatose body of the second Citizen V, John Watkins III. Zemo quickly killed Andrea to keep her from telling anyone his secret.{{r|Citizen V and the V-Battalion Vol 1 #3}}

===Clone===
After Andrea's death, Andreas became the fourth Swordsman and joined the New Thunderbolts.

===Return===

| Powers                  = 
As a result of genetic engineering when they were still in utero, the twins possess bio-energy powers which only function if the twins are in physical contact - usually by holding hands. Andrea generates blasts of destructive energy that can disintegrate matter, while Andreas fires bolts of pure concussive force. Their powers also allow them to fly, though again, only when they are in physical contact.
