| History                 = ===Origins===
'''Paibok''' was born on the planet [[Tarnax IV]], in the Tarnax System in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] and which was part of the [[Skrull Empire]], but has since been destroyed. Paibok was trained at the Skrull military academy, and became a Skrull espionage agent, and a captain in the Skrull armed forces.

Paibok was behind the plot to replace [[Alicia Masters (Earth-616)|Alicia Masters]] with [[Lyja (Earth-616)|Lyja]].{{r|Fantastic Four #358}}

===Fearsome Foursome===
When [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Johnny Storm]] went to trial for setting fire to [[Empire State University]], he was attacked in the courtroom by [[Paibok (Earth-616)|Paibok]] and [[Devos (Earth-616)|Devos]]. Simultaneously, Klaw attempted to have his revenge upon the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] by manipulating [[Tara Richards (Earth-6311)|Huntara]] into joining them. Working together they attacked the FF as the [[Fearsome Foursome (Earth-616)|Fearsome Foursome]].{{r|Fantastic Four #377}} However the Fantastic Four were [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]], [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]] and [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]]. They were winning until the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] arrived, so they decided to retreat through a portal opened by Huntara. Daredevil attempted to pursue, but the dimension in which he found himself confused his senses, and he had to be pulled out by Spider-Man.{{r|Fantastic Four #378}} On Paibok's starship they planned to destroy the FF at [[Four Freedoms Plaza]], where they lay in wait for the Fantastic Four's return. When the heroes returned, Huntara launched into battle with [[Franklin Richards (Earth-6311)|Psi-Lord]], leading the two of them away from the others. The remaining members of the Fantastic Four were taken out by knock-out gas delivered by Devos and Paibok. The two allies then teleported their captives to Paibok's ship, so that they could turn them over to the [[Skrull Empire]]. After they had disappeared, Klaw came out of hiding, and took the unconscious body of [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] prisoner.{{r|Fantastic Four #382}}

Paibok's triumph was short-lived, though -- once on Throneworld he discovered that Devos was a wanted criminal, a renegade with a price on his head and an entire world under his command. Devos promptly summoned his troops, took personal command of his ship and attempted to destroy Throneworld. The Empress blamed Paibok for this and repaid him by ordering his death.

Seeking to redeem himself, Paibok made his way on board the ship and confronted Devos. The ship's stardrive was damaged during their confrontation and the cruiser fell into subspace -- Devos and Paibok were both believed lost along with the ship.

===Earthfall===
Paibok somehow escaped from subspace and led a contingent of Skrull forces to Earth to capture the infant [[Watchers|Watcher]], [[Talmadge (Earth-616)|Talmadge]], but was stopped by the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] and [[Kree]] forces and arrested. While being transported to the [[Kyln]], the prison ship crashed in Alaska where he led the surviving prisoners in enslaving the native populace to repair what could be salvaged from the prison ship to leave Earth. [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax the Destroyer]], who was also on the prison ship, killed the other alien convicts and not wishing to engage in battle with Drax and wanting to get off Earth, he used a beacon he took from the corpse of a guard to hail another prison ship to collect them.{{r|Drax the Destroyer #4}}

===Annihilation===
However, while imprisoned in the Kyln the [[Annihilation Wave (Earth-616)|Annihilation]] Wave broke out which destroyed the Kyln. He was captured by Annihilus' forces and enslaved with mind-control parasites. Thus he fought for [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]] throughout the Annihilation incident.{{r|Annihilation #2}}

When Annihilus was defeated by [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]], the mind-control stopped having any effect and he escaped with [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax]] and [[Infant Terrible (Earth-616)|The Delinquent]] to a minor planet controlled by Randau the Space Parasite who had enslaved the native population and the crews of any ships that passed the planet. Together, they defeated Randau, whereupon Paibok (who accompanied Delinquent) and Terrax went on their separate ways.{{r|Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus #1}}

===S.W.O.R.D.===
Following the unification of the Skrull and Kree Empires into the [[Kree/Skrull Alliance (Earth-616)|Alliance]], Paibok became an ambassor for the new regime to [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]]{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1}}

| Powers                  = '''Skrull Shape-Shifting:''' Like other [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]], Paibok is a shape-shifter. They can mentally cause the unstable molecules that comprise his or her body to become pliant, enabling him or her to assume other forms through muscular expansion and contraction. Once a new shape has been assumed, it takes a conscious act of will to assume another form or revert to natural. Hence, Skrulls do not spontaneously lose their assumed form when asleep or unconscious. Skrulls in altered form will, however, revert to their original forms at the moment of death.

* '''Bio-Electrical Projection:''' Paibok possesses the ability to bodily generate electrostatic energy which he can release or harness for a number of effects.

| Weaknesses              = '''Shape-Shifting Limitations:''' Skrulls only take on the appearance of an object or person and none of that object or personâ€™s characteristics. There is a limit to the size of the object or person a Skrull can imitate. The average Skrull cannot distend his or her mass any more than 1.5 times as large a volume as his or her original volume, nor can he or she contract his or her mass any more than 0.75 a volume as his or her original.

| Notes                   = * Paibok is wanted by the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]] for crimes against the peace and murder.{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files #1}}
** The quadrant of these crimes are in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], [[Milky Way]].{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files #1}} Most likely due to his skirmishing with the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], and other conflicts on [[Earth]].
** He was stated to be a "local" threat level.{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files #1}}
** Due to his status as the ambassador for the newly formed [[Kree/Skrull Alliance (Earth-616)|Alliance]] to [[S.W.O.R.D.]] and the disbandment of the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]], his legal status is in question.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1}}
| Trivia                  = * Paibok claims to detest violence for the sake of violence.{{r|Drax the Destroyer #2}}
