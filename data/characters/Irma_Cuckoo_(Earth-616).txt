===Origin===
While [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] lay in a comatose state, [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Dr. John Sublime]] harvested eggs from her to begin experimentation. The [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus program]] then used the eggs to create thousands of identical [[Homo superior|mutant]] girls in the hope of developing a powerful weapon capable of killing every mutant on [[Earth]] by combining their [[Telepathy|telepathic abilities]]. The project was designated '''[[Weapon XIV]]''', and girls were incubated and artificially aged inside the subterranean level of [[The World]].{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #4}} While most girls remained dormant, five were sent to infiltrate the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] as student sisters to hone their talents for Sublime's purpose.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #3}}{{r|New X-Men #118}}

===Xavier Institute===
After the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] went public,{{r|New X-Men #117}} Mindee and her sisters were enrolled as orphan quintuplet sisters.{{r|New X-Men #118}} To protect their secret origins, the girls unconsciously placed mental blocks in the minds of the faculty, preventing them from investigating their background.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #2}}

[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 1 134 001.jpg|thumb|left|Mindee and her sisters strutting in the halls of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Institute]]]] 
The girls quickly gained the moniker "'''The [[Stepford Cuckoos]]'''", though their chosen codename was the '''[[Five-In-One]]'''. [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] took a special interest in the girls, and the Cuckoos became her protégés.{{r|New X-Men #126}}{{r|New X-Men #134}}

When [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Kid Omega]] led a rebellion of [[Omega Gang (Earth-616)|students]] at the X-Mansion, Sophie encouraged Mindee and the other Cuckoos to take action, and they covertly snuck into [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]]. Using [[Kick]] to amp up her powers, Sophie and her sisters were able to stop Quire. Unfortunately, Sophie died in the process.{{r|New X-Men #134|137}}

With the death of Sophie, the Five-In-One became the '''[[Four-In-One]]'''. The girls were furious with Emma Frost, whom they blamed for Sophie's death.{{r|New X-Men #138}} This mourning and anger was multiplied when Esme attempted to murder Emma, fled the X-Mansion,{{r|New X-Men #139|141}} and joined [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood]]. With the departure and later death of Esme, the Four-In-One became the '''[[Three-In-One]]'''.{{r|New X-Men #146|150}}

The girls were among the [[Xavier Institute student body|students]] temporarily relocated to an [[X-Corporation (Earth-616)|X-Corp building]] in [[Salem Center]] while the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Institute]] was being rebuilt.{{r|New X-Men #155}} It was here that Mindee's first boyfriend, [[Germaine Caruso (Earth-616)|Germaine]], died during an anti-mutant riot.{{r|New X-Men #156}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 #13}}

[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 15 0001.jpg|thumb|left|The Three-In-One as students in the [[Corsairs Squad (Earth-616)|Corsairs Squad]]]]
When the Institute was rebuilt under the leadership of co-headmasters Cyclops and Emma Frost, the students were organized into several [[X-Men Training Squads (Earth-616)|training squads]] with an assigned mentor staff member.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #1|3}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #157}} Mindee and her sisters were assigned to the [[Corsairs Squad (Earth-616)|Corsairs Squad]] under the tutelage of Cyclops with the girls serving equally as co-leaders of the squad.{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}

===M-Day===
On [[Decimation|M-Day]] the vast majority of the world's mutant population was depowered. Mindee and her sisters retained their powers, but they were three of only twenty-seven students to retain their powers. Fearing for the students' safety, Emma Frost ordered that the depowered students and staff leave the Institute. For their safety, the depowered students were brought through the [[Alley|Morlock Tunnels]] to an awaiting bus. Unfortunately, the bus of depowered students was bombed by anti-mutant zealot [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Rev. William Stryker]], killing all forty-two of the former students on board.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #24}}

The remaining students were placed by Emma Frost into an all-out brawl, and the ones deemed the best by Emma would become a group of [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]] in-training. This entire exercise was met with disgust by the Three-In-One, who promptly informed Cyclops of Emma's actions.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #23}}

===Warsong===
When an unstable fraction of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] sparked inside the girls, the dormant [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus]] nanotech inside their bones was activated. This nanotech briefly reanimated Sophie and Esme, who directed their sisters back to [[The World]] to activate [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Sublime]]'s plan for the destruction of the [[Homo superior|mutant race]].{{r|{{cl|X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 2}}-[[X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 5|5]]}}
[[File:Irma Cuckoo (Earth-616) from X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 3 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Mindee being pulled into [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Sublime]]'s [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus]] machine]]

The Phoenix and Sublime both wrestled for control of the Cuckoos when the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] arrived. Mindee appeared apathetic and consigned to her fate as part of Sublime's weapon. Soon Phoebe was captured and integrated into Sublime's machine, but the Phoenix was able to possess Celeste. When Celeste was finally merged into the machine, the Phoenix was divided between all the Cuckoos and trapped in their newly emerged second mutation, organic diamond hearts. This event finally activated the '''Thousand-In-One'''.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 2}}-[[X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 5|5]]}}

Celeste continued to resist the Phoenix and Sublime's machine long enough for the X-Men to forcibly disconnect them. In a rage, Phoebe triggered a power surge that caused an explosion, but Celeste was able take full control of the Phoenix. Celeste destroyed her new sisters, and trapped the Phoenix fragments inside the Three-In-One's flawless diamond hearts rendering them emotionless.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #5}}

===Endangered Species===
After returning to the Institute, the girls adopted a rebellious/mischievous streak. They helped [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]] telepathically gain a Ph.D. level knowledge of science and biology from [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]]'s brain.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #38}} Along with the other students, they were pulled into [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]], where they were rescued by [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|Prodigy]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #37|41}} To repay his kindness, the Cuckoos restored all of the knowledge he had previously gain with the use of his powers despite his powers being deactivated.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #42}} Mindee and her sister were briefly considered as potential candidates for recruitment to the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]].{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report #1}}

After [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|the birth of the]] [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Mutant Messiah]], the Stepford sisters were stationed in [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]] to search for the baby and act as central communication for the various X-squads.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 206}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 494}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 27}}

===Utopia===
The Stepford Cuckoos rejoined the X-Men and the last of [[Homo superior|mutantkind]] in [[San Francisco]]. During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], they assisted in the evacuation of a San Francisco Hospital, and later offered remote support to Emma while bringing down the Skrulls' psychic blockade.{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men #1|4}}

[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) and Scott Summers (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 517 0001.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix fragments]] abandoning the Three-In-One]]
During [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Osborn]]'s [[Utopia (Event)|assault on the X-Men]], Cyclops assigned Mindee to be captured.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #514}} Acting as a Trojan horse, through her link with her sisters Mindee was able to lead the X-Men to [[Alcatraz Island]], where Osborn had secretly been imprisoning mutants.{{r|Dark Avengers #8}}

Once they relocated to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], the Stepford Cuckoos frequently manned [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]].{{r|Nation X #2}}{{r|Generation Hope #9}} When [[Lobe (Earth-616)|Lobe]], with [[John Greycrow (Earth-616)|Scalphunter]], brought a group of [[Predator X|Predator Xs]] to attack Utopia the X-Men were forced to battle the mutant-eating creatures. The Cuckoos served as telepathic communication for the team, but during the battle the Phoenix fragments that were contained inside their diamond hearts escaped, mysteriously returned to space, and left the girls unconscious.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #517}} With the loss of the Phoenix, the girls fell into a depressive funk. Mindee began sneaking into [[San Francisco]] and purchasing horror film DVDs to help entertain her and her sisters.{{r|Nation X #4}}

After Cyclops and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] decided to part ways, Mindee wanted to remain on Utopia while Phoebe wanted to return to [[Westchester County|Westchester]]. With the deciding vote left to Celeste, she opted to stay on Utopia, partly because of Quentin Quire's presence at the school.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}}{{r|X-Men: Schism #5}} 

===Changes===
When the Phoenix Force returned to Earth searching for a new host leading to the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|war]] between the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], the Stepford Cuckoos were among the younger X-Men detained in the [[Avengers Compound]] with the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]].{{r|Avengers Academy #30|33}} Afterword they were reluctantly recruited to the new [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School]] where the manned Cerebra and witnessed the death of Professor X and the reemergence of mutantkind.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #12}}{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #18}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 #19}}

[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 4 002.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Three-In-One moving to the [[Weapon X Facility|New Xavier School]]]]
The girls were very displeased with the new school.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #15}} When Cyclops and his X-Men came to the school looking for recruits to their mutant rebellion, the Stepford sisters and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] volunteered to go.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 4}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 5|5]]}}

Since then Mindee and her sisters aided Cyclops' X-Men when they were again brought to Limbo, by temporarily removing the fear of the new recruits in battle with the forces of [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 5|7}} They also rescued [[David Bond (Earth-616)|David Bond]] from being killed by a police officer.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 8}}

[[File:Irma Cuckoo (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 9 0001.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Irma Cuckoo revealing her cut and dyed black hair.]]
Always the most individual of the Three-in-One, Mindee surprised her sisters by deciding to change her appearance by dyeing her hair black and cutting it short to find a "new me". While Celeste disapproved of it, Emma Frost defended her actions and [[Christopher Muse (Earth-616)|Triage]] complimented her, making her smile.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 9}}

She later participated in the training in Tabula Rasa, keeping Triage calm so he didn't panic while in the new situation.{{Citation}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Irma was one of the many mutants that opposed the crazed [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] from remaking the world in his image. When X-Man realized that his vision of the world would never come about with the X-Men around, X-Man made his enemies vanish in an instant, including Irma.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9|10}}

Irma and the others were transported to another [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|plane of existence]] by X-Man created in an attempt at a utopia where they and all other mutants would be at peace, altering their memories so they wouldn't resist.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}} Irma Cuckoo was made a producer and a professional assistant for [[Studio X (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Studio X]]. She and her sister, [[Celeste Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Celeste]], made sure that the studio was running smoothly and she also handled the needs of stars like [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Meggan Puceanu (Earth-616)|Meggan Puceanu]]. She attended an after party for one of Kurt's movies where she and Celeste helped out a little girl named Tiffany who wanted to attend the party also.{{r|Age of X-Man: The Amazing Nightcrawler Vol 1 1}}

While not observed, Irma was presumably returned to the real world when X-Man decided to release the mutants he forced to live in his plane of existence.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

===House of X===
Irma and her sisters joined the mutant-only nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. One of their duties was escorting a group of human ambassadors in the [[Jerusalem Habitat]] through a [[Gateways|Krakoan Gateway]] so they could meet with Magneto and Emma Frost to discuss potential recognition of Krakoa as an official nation.{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}}

| Trivia                  = * This character is first identified as <u>Mindee</u> in {{cl|New X-Men #156}}. However, later [[Matt Fraction]] [[Glossary:Retcon|retconned]] Mindee's name to actually be <u>Irma</u> to comply with creator [[Grant Morrison]]'s original desire for first letters the quintuplet's first names to spell "SPICE", hence Sophie, Phoebe, Irma (or Mindee), Celeste, and Esme. Her real name, seems to have been revealed (apparently as originally intended by Morrison) in {{cl|Uncanny X-Men #514}}.
* Mindee enjoys playing piano.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #157}}
