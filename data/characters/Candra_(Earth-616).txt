Candra, who has been referred to as The Benefactress and Candra of the Floating Spires, is part of a rare subspecies of immortal mutants called [[Externals (Earth-616)|Externals]], representing Guile.{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #13}}{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #14}}{{r|X-Force Vol 1 #37}} Other than Candra’s claim that nearly a millennia ago a mortal gained possession of an External heart and it cost her dearly,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #61}} dealings with the High Lords and her Heart-Gem, nothing is known of her past before her involvement with [[Assassins Guild (Earth-616)|Assassins]] and [[Thieves Guild (Earth-616)|Thieves Guild]] of [[New Orleans]], as well the [[Egyptian]] Thieves Guild.{{r|Gambit Vol 1 #1}}{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 #7}}

===High Lords===
During the twelfth century C.E., when some of her Externals formed the High Lords, Candra declined to join preferring not to share her power and play the "power broker" alone.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #60}} Fearing the wrath of the others she formed a plan to extract the life energy of her own immortal heart into a stone.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #60}} She summoned [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]], [[Garbha-Hsien (Earth-616)|Saul]], [[Crule (Earth-616)|Crule]], [[Nicodemus (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Nicodemus]] and [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|En Sabah Nur]], her fellow Externals to aid her. While the ritual took place, Nur felt as he sunk the blade into her heart that he could have taken her power, and some that it was theft to place a shared thing into a stone where she could hide it from them, though none moved against her.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 11}} With the ritual a success Candra now had the means to protect herself but at a cost; as with the gem, Candra has full access to her abilities. Without it, she is weakened and vulnerable.{{r|Rogue Vol 1 #4}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #60|61}}

===The Guilds===
Generations ago, Candra arrived at the new world where she established a pact with the [[New Orleans]] Assassins and Thieves Guilds. She provided the Assassins with great power,{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 #7}}{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #12}} enough to protect her should her immortal brethren intend to due her harm. She bestowed the thieves with [[Elixir of Life]]{{r|Special Marvel Edition Vol 1 15}}{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #12}}{{r|Gambit #1|3|4}} to extend their ability to divine and resurrect the Old Kingdom. These would be provided by monetary tribute from each guild every certain number of years through a ritual called “tithing".{{r|Gambit #1}}{{r|Rogue Vol 1 #2}}

===Stealing Power===
[[File:Candra_(Earth-616)_from_Gambit_Vol_3_14.jpg|thumb|left]]
In 1891 London, the Thieves Guild's failure to acquire the [[Momentary Princess]] forced [[Jacques LeBeau (Earth-616)|Jacques LeBeau]] and [[Rouler Marceaux (Earth-616)|Rouler Marceaux]] to gather as much monetary tribute. Candra kidnapped their kids [[Jean-Luc LeBeau (Earth-616)|Jean-Luc LeBeau]] and [[Belize Marceaux (Earth-616)|Belize Marceaux]].{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #12}} But the [[Tithe Collector (Earth-616)|Tithe Collector]], wanting to restore the way things were, helped Jacques bring her a text of gestation chamber [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|En Sabah Nur]]. Thanks to [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] from the future, alone with [[Jacob Gavin, Jr. (Earth-616)|Courier]] came back to help his father and the guild be free of Candra made her aware of the man [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Dr. Nathan Milbury]] that knew of the location of the gestation chamber.{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #12}}

As Candra went to America she sent the guild to find Nathan Milbury, while Gambit knowing Milbury was really Sinister tried to stop them. With his father Jean-Luc LeBeau, just a kid then and the rest of his guild captured by Sinister, long with his friend Courier he made a deal. If Sinister would free his clan and send them En Sabah Nur for Candra, as well as fix Courier and he’ll give him a piece of his brain in return.{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #12|14}}

Once the guild made it beneath the pyramids outside of [[Banī-Mazā]] in [[Egypt]] they were confronted by En Sabah Nur's servant [[Ozymandias (Earth-616)|Ozymandias]]. But unbeknownst to Guild LeBeau Candra had been fallowing them, after she appears she imprisoned Ozymandias with her telekinetic powers and waited for the guild who learned this place dates back to their earliest ancestry to translate the texts within the walls of En Sabah Nur ancient citadel which will give her powers to fold space through her magic as En Sabah Nur does through science. But before the guild could begin Gambit with The Courier and Sinister suddenly appeared using a transport ship Sinister got from En Sabah Nur years back, Gambit quickly attacks Candra catching her of guard. Candra enraged and deciding that she could take En Sabah Nur's power anytime begins to bring the sanctum down but she is stopped when attacked by Sinister who quickly over powers her with his new found metamorphic ability. Defeated she begs for him to stop and as he does Sinister reveals the High Lords who knew of her plans come to stop her for all of them know En Sabah Nor's citadel is not to be touched, his glacier crawl to power is not to be interrupted. For their greater glory awaits the Millennial Dawn{{r|X-Force Vol 1 #12}}{{r|X-Force #17}}{{r|X-Force #25}} and Candra's actions put that at risk.{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #14}}

But when Jean found it first he was attacked by Strucker, who he quickly beat when Candra appeared. She tried to get him to give it to her, but the Howling Commandos showed up and attacked her. As they tried to keep her busy Jean-Luc let go of the [[Momentary Princess]] and it disappeared, knowing it’ll be another 27-29 years before she’ll get a second chance left.{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #10}}

But with the dying [[Bella Donna Boudreaux (Earth-616)|Bella]] her brother [[Julien Boudreaux (Earth-616)|Julien]] returned, he planned to use his sisters then husband Gambit to get the Elixir of Life from his clan. Who though Candra was no longer the Thieves Guild benefactress, they still participated in the Tithing every generation. When this plan failed Julien with his assassins and thieves tried to take the elixir from Tithe Collector, but failed as the Collector escaped and went to Paris to warn Candra.{{r|Gambit #1|3}}

Gideon needing to handle business of his own left, but Candra would rather deal with her own affairs especially knowing Gambit was coming for the elixir. Candra kidnapped Gambit’s father Jean-Luc and when he arrived she was going to make him kill his father for the elixir, but Julien and his mercenaries attacked trying to kill Candra for the elixir. Gambit saved her and after she promised not to kill his father Gambit, using their past romance, stole the elixir from her cleavage while sharing a kiss.{{r|Gambit #3}}

After a few words and a brief fight between Bond and Gambit she left with Jamil much to El-Gibar's displeasure, but the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] went after them to save Jamil.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 #7}}

[[File:Candra_(Earth-616)_vs._Ororo_Munroe_(Earth-616)_from_X-Men_Unlimited_Vol_1_7_001.png|thumb|300px]]
After the X-Men extracted the whereabouts of Candra's palatial from some street urchins they are confronted by Jamil and his gang before they could go.

When Candra learned of the death of the Assassins Guilds leader Marius Boudreaux and his daughter Bella now in charge came to her at the funeral.{{r|Rogue Vol 1 #1}} Wanting to once again gain control over the guild, Candra used Bella’s anger towards [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] for having temporarily stealing her memories and Gambit for all he had done to achieve this goal. Once she returned to her former position as benefactress of the guild, Candra manipulated and watched as Bella went after Gambit's current love Rogue through [[Cody Robbins (Earth-616)|Cody]].{{r|Gambit Vol 1 #3}}{{r|Rogue Vol 1 #1}}{{r|Rogue Vol 1 #3}}

While showing Rogue the imprisoned Cody, Tante Mattie, and Gambit for sport, she temporarily removed their powers, the two enemies fight and even after continuing to fight when Bella stabbed her in the shoulder Rogue ran away trying to recover. Bella realizing Candra was using her had enough of Candra's games and confronts her but Candra threatens Bella by telling her that if she doesn't kill Rogue she will kill her and destroy all the other Guilds. Well Bella goes to deal with Rogue, Gambit frees himself and tries to attack Candra who easily overwhelms him. But lets him go when Rogue arrives with a beaten Bella, she drops him and turns to Cody and throws him through the wall. Rogue tries to get to Cody but her powers are not fully back, Candra despite starting to weaken well holding Cody in midair but plays with Gambit and Rogue.{{r|Rogue Vol 1 #3|4}}

the Guilds to whom she wasted so much time on was drained and needing to escape.{{r|X-Force #52|54}}{{r|X-Force #20}}{{r|X-Force #37}}{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #14}}{{r|X-Men #60|61}}{{r|Gambit #4}}{{r|Rogue Vol 1 #4}}

Due to an event called [[Black September]]{{r|Night Man Vol 2 ∞}} Candra found a doorway to another world like her own, but without [[Homo Superior|Mutants]], [[Externals (Earth-616)|Externals]] and Guilds in the [[Earth-93060|Ultraverse]] where she can start over. Apprehensive to go it alone, she reached out to one time love and on again off again foe [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]]. As she tried to convince an ignoring Gambit the power to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|X-Manson]] went out, he went to look he was attacked by a dying [[John Domingo (Earth-93060)|Night Man]] who came looking for [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|Night Man / Gambit Vol 1 #1}}

As Gambit fought Night Man the Sorceress [[Rhiannon (Earth-93060)|Rhiannon]] wanting to save the Night Man by reuniting the Night Men, opened an inter-dimensional rift sending her and an unaware Night Man to the X-Manson. But once there she found Gambit caring for a dying Night Man while her Night Man ended up elsewhere. In New Orleans Candra found a hurt and feral [[John Domingo (Duplicate) (Earth-93060)|Night Man]], knowing who he was and where he was from, she healed him and enhancing his strength followed him to the X-Manson. Back at the X-Manson Night Man tried to feverishly warn Gambit of Rhiannon plan to use his heart to heal him, the feral Night Man in his arrival causing Gambit to go investigate. As feral Night Man and Gambit fought the other Night Man tried to stop it but Rhiannon knocked them out.{{r|Night Man / Gambit Vol 1 #2}}

Once ready with the feral Night Man holding Gambit, she was about to kill Gambit when Candra, who had been staying back appeared. Candra declared both feral Night Man and Gambit belong to her, but she would allow Rhiannon to bleed him for a chance to be free on another world. But Gambit fought back to free himself when both Night Men confront each other, Rhiannon realized that it wasn’t Gambit’s flesh they needed but each other. Candra not wanting to lose her Night Man attacked Rhiannon, but having none of it Rhiannon throw her off with wind and dust. Though Gambit could not see through the black storm Candra could and throw Rhiannon’s knife at her, but the dying Night Man jumped in the way taking the hit. As the feral Night Man to Candra’s surprise, grabbed her by the throat, the dying Night Man told Rhiannon to use his sacrifice to send her and the feral one back home. Angry with Candra while unleash an elemental force to open the inter-dimensional rift, was going to destroy them all she stopped allowing them to live as she and the feral Night Man disappeared.{{r|Night Man / Gambit Vol 1 #3}}

As the doorway began to close Candra let it suck her in, but Gambit grabbed hold of her hand and promising her to help let go of the Guilds and find what she needs. Though Gambit did not know all of her reasoning, Candra was moved by his words and choose to stay and allow the doorway to close forever behind her.{{r|Night Man / Gambit Vol 1 #3}}

===Death of an Immortal===
[[File:Candra_(Earth-616)_Death_from_X-Men_Vol_2_-61.png|thumb|left|156px]]
When Candra through [[Jamil (Earth-616)|Jamil]] learned that it was Storm who stolen her Heart-Gem, she had the leader of the Egyptian thieves [[Karima (Earth-616)|Karima]] kidnapped. Controlling Cyclops’ mind she sent him to deliver the message, and in brutal fashion attacked Storm. Once Storm beat him Candra spoke to her through Cyclops, telling to bring her Heart-Gem to [[Manhattan]] at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in the Temple of Dendar section alone.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #60}}

Once Storm arrives Candra confronts her and when she threatens to destroy her Heart-Gem, Candra not only revealed a captured Karima but her ward Jamil. Jamil attacked Storms mind making her see herself in [[Wakanda]] with [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|T'Challa]], Storm thinking she wont be played with attacks them both, forcing them to the ground with powerful winds. But Jamil not only tricked her and took the Heart-Gem but turned on both Candra and Storm revealing himself to be the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]]. While the Shadow King announces he had been using Candra and declared victory, she watched as Storm encased him with her Heart in ice and snow. When Storm became distracted with Karima she used the opportunity to hit Storm with a telekinetic bolt and goes to reclaim her Heart-Gem, but as Candra digs for it she is suddenly hit and sent flying by [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] who exploded from the ice where the Shadow King had once been.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #61}}

When Storm with Karima comes to a hurt but not beat Candra, to confront her about Jamil becoming the Shadow King and then Juggernaut. Candra explains that its an extension of Jamil's powers, that because he wields the extra-worldly energy confined in the heart of an [[Externals (Earth-616)|External]] he may have become to powerful. But to learn the truth Candra choose to go it alone and showing Storm not only will it take more than a powerful blast of wind or a hit from Juggernaut to stop her, but she is more than capable of handling herself without the use of her power attacks Storm. Candra  quickly overwhelms Storm giving her a beating, but Storm manages to flip Candra off her and into the temple which collapses on her. Once again Candra showing her physical toughness reemerges blasting the debris away, free she finds Jamil had become [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] with Storm in his arms, before she could act is hit by a telekinetic blast and knocked down hard.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #61}}

Candra quickly recover and finds Storm after getting Karima clear had returned, she learns from Storm that in her zeal to claim a young mutant of incredible power she didn't see the true mutant was Karima. That Jamil was a created from Karima's desire for companionship and projected Candra's desire to find the gem into Jamil. Candra enraged will have her Heart-Gem, Karima to who she'll add her power to her own and Storms rotting corpse at her feet goes for Storm. But when Storm throws the gem Candra turns for it and as she is about to take hold of it, Cyclops who had been tracking Storm through [[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebro]] along with [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] appears and blast the Heart-Gem. As he destroys the gem in a blinding release of energy Candra was gone.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #61}}

===[[The Newer Mutants]]===
Same time later after having her body destroyed Candra came back, she would then return to her home in New Orleans where she’d lay low for a number of years. One stormy night being mysteriously woken she went to investigate, to her shock the intruder was [[Gideon (Earth-18352)|Gideon]], though not the Gideon she know, rather one from [[Earth-18352|the future]]. Gideon had chosen to do what Selene had failed to do and achieve godhood by stealing the essence of his fellow Externals. Choosing Candra to be the first, he attacked her; however, she put up a fight for hours before lost. Gideon killed Candra and took her heart and her essence.{{r|Cable Vol 1 153}}

This event brought Cable thirteen years into the past to investigate what he believed was anomaly in regards to when the Externals should die off. With [[Longshot (Mojoverse)|Longshot]] in tow he went to the [[New Orleans Forensic Center]] where Candra’s body was taken, there using Longshot's psychometric insight on Candra, he hoped to discovering what happened, but learning nothing more than she was woken and put up hours of a fight, Cable was forced to continue the investigation by confronting Selene.{{r|Cable Vol 1 150}}

In the end Gideon would fail,{{r|Cable Vol 1 154}} and some time later Candra was reborn as was often the case with the Externals.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 #18|19}}

===Return of an External===
[[File:Candra_(Earth-616)_killing_Assassins_Guild_(Earth-616)_Scarlet_Spider_Vol_2_-19.jpg|thumb|300px]]
According to Candra, the X-Men only destroyed her body but not her psyche. Candra managed to "take strength from death... enough to augment her remaining power and slowly pull back the pieces of her body back together", a process which was hastened by tributes from the [[Assassins Guild (Earth-616)|Assassins Guild]]. Still a zombie-like figure, Candra, calling herself the "Red Death", tried to get the essences of [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] to finally return entirely, but was stopped by the duo with the help of some rogue members of the Guild. After a ferocious battle against Wolverine, she was killed by Scarlet Spider, who stung her in the head. [[Bella Donna Boudreaux (Earth-616)|Belladonna]] announced that she would still find a way to return.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 #17|19}}

===Guilds United===
Candra returned following the fight with the Scarlet Spider, though this time she was still a child when she sought to regaining control of the Thieves Guild, she made a deal with Belladonna to unify both of their guilds in order to improve their strength. This resulted in Candra, along with Bella's help, luring Gambit back to New Orleans in an elaborate plan. He was captured by the guilds after he broke in, where Candra explained about his duty to the guilds and how his adventures with the X-Men and his [[Love & Marriage|honeymoon in space]] were more important to him than his job as leader.

After some small talk, Gambit was shot by a plasma blast from his ex-wife Belladonna and then wrapped in chains to be brought to one of their cells. An unexpected appearance by Rogue almost hindered Candra's plan, but she was able to knock Rogue out with a telekinetic blast. As Gambit awoke from being shocked by an electrical surge when he tried to touch Rogue, he was brought before Candra and Bella as they tied Rogue to an X-shaped cross in ordered to be sacrificed.{{r|Mr. and Mrs. X Vol 1 11}}

===External Gate===
Choosing to answer a summons through their shared psychic-link from Apocalypse she went to the Eternal Caldera of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], and there joined by Selene, Saul, Crule, Nicodemus, Gideon, and Absolam waited for Apocalypse. When Apocalypse arrived not wanting to play his games they learned of his plans for them, with Canadra and Nicodemus speaking out against him, they refused to go along with his belief of what their purpose should be nor willing to sacrifice themselves for his goals. Apocalypse would force Candra and the others to be sacrificed by playing his trump card in a newly enhanced [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]]. Rictor erupted from the ground in a blast of lava killing Crule. After an enraged Nicodemus attacked, forcing Apocalypse to call out for Selene, Gideon and Rictor to his side Absalom disrupted their chat by firing a number of his bone spikes at them. Rictor turned to face Candra, Absalom, Nicodemus, and Saul. Even as Saul turned into a great dragon Rictor blasted them with a wave of lava unintentionally killing Candra along with Nicodemus and Saul. Absalom though weakened and hurt survived, Apocalypse needing four living Externals for the ritual let him live, only to find that Candra's life force was never there.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 12}}

Prior to Apocalypse's summons Candra learned he was after ancient mutant bones, and it was only a matter of time he'd come for his fellow Externals. So Candra using her ritual placed her life force into a gem and hide it in [[Avalon (Otherworld)|Avalon's]] [[Starlight Citadel]]. Thanks to Gambit who had been sent to Avalon with the rest of [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] by Apocalypse happened to find the gem. In astral form Candra would talk to Gambit in hope of convincing him to protect her from Apocalypses and return the gem to her. When Apocalypse opening a gateway Rictor was able to telepathically warn Betsy who knew of Candra, she told Gambit to throw the gem through the gate. Despite Candra and [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Saturnyne's]] protests Gambit did and with the gem finding its mark the ritual was done.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 12}}

With the ancient bones of Candra, Saul, Crule, and Nicodemus, thus their life energy, turned into the stones that powers the [[External Gate]],{{r|X-Men Vol 5 12}} trapping them, and allowing the whole of Krakoa to enter [[Otherworld]] as Apocalypse planned.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 12}}

| Powers                  = Candra is a very powerful telekinetic. As an External, she is immortal. <br>

'''Immortal:''' She is effectively immortal and since Candra's immortality became active after her first death she no longer ages. Though she can be put out of commission or seemingly destroyed for various periods of time, Candra can not be killed.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #61}}{{r|Cable Vol 1 150}}{{r|Cable Vol 1 153}}{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 #19}}
* '''''Rapid Healing:''''' Ability to endure injuries (within unknown limits) without lasting harm or even feeling pain{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 #7}}, she could apparently regenerate injured or missing cells from even near-fatal injuries.
* '''''Resurrection:''''' As an immortal, Candra has shown to be able to resurrected herself in a number of ways; such as after having her body destroyed{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #61}} she was seen 10 years later back to full health,{{r|Cable Vol 1 150}}{{r|Cable Vol 1 153}} some time after having her heart eaten she was back using the life essence of others to pull herself together again{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 #19}} and again Candra came back but in the form of her 13 year old self.{{r|Mr. and Mrs. X Vol 1 11}}

'''Psychic-Link:''' As an External, she shares a telepathic-link with her fellow Externals that allows them to not only sense each other and where, but can call on each other at will from great distances.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 11}}{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 12}} She is also able to sense when one rises from their first death and when one is killed by another External.{{r|X-Force #10}}{{r|X-Force #53}}{{r|Cable Vol 1 150}}{{r|Cable Vol 1 152}}{{r|Cable Vol 1 154}}

'''Superhuman Durability:''' Candra has shown to be incredibly durable, having been dealt heavy damage that would have killed most and walked away with vary little injuries.{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #10}}{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #14}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #61}}{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 #19}}{{r|Mr. and Mrs. X Vol 1 12}}

'''Telekinesis:''' Candra is an incredibly high level psychokinetic, shown to not only be able to manipulate objects and people, even holding them in mid-air.{{r|Rogue Vol 1 #4}}{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #14}}{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 #19}} But also bring down a building.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 #7}} Due to the fact Candra once place a large some of her power in a gem limiting her use, then a zombie-like figure and later was in the form of a child, she has yet to fully display her powers.
*'''''Flight/Levitation:'''''{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 #7}}{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #10}}{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #14}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #61}}{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 #19}}

*'''''Force Field:'''''{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 #7}}{{r|Rogue Vol 1 #4}}
*'''''Matter Manipulation:'''''{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #14}}
*'''''Light Manipulation:'''''{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #60}}
*'''''Telekinetic Teleportation (Potentially):'''''{{r|Gambit Vol 1 #4}}
*'''''X-Factor Activation/Deactivation:''''' Candra can use this ability at a molecular level and often uses it to activate latent mutant genes in individuals, granting them active mutant powers. She has also implied that, once given, she can also take these abilities away, presumably by returning the appropriate genes to their latent states.{{r|Rogue Vol 1 #3}}{{r|Night Man / Gambit Vol 1 #3}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #60}}{{r|Mr. and Mrs. X Vol 1 11}} But she has also shown to be able to remove, whether temporarily or permanently, already activate mutant genes.{{r|Rogue Vol 1 #3|4}}

'''Telepathy:''' Candra has also shown at least to have some unknown level of telepathic abilities.
*'''''Mind Possession:'''''{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #60}}
*'''''Telepathic Cloak:'''''{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #10}}{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 #7}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #60|61}}
*'''''Astral Projection:'''''{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #60}}

'''Psionic Vampirism:''' She used this ability to slowly pull the pieces of her body back together after it was destroyed by the X-Men,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #61}} a process which was hastened through tributes and ritual sacrifice. Later she used this power on her own people in the [[Assassins Guild (Earth-616)|Assassins Guild]], when she was injured by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]].{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 #18}}{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 #19}}

Candra has also displayed the abilities to cause pain with a thought,{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 #7}} and project flames,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #60}}{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 #19}} but these affects could be either form of telepathy or telekinesis.
