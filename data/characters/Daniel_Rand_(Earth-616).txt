===Early Life===
Daniel Rand was the son of businessman [[Wendell Rand (Earth-616)|Wendell Rand]], who had once lived in the fabled city of [[K'un-Lun]], which exists in another dimensional realm. Wendell Rand-K'ai, as he was known there was the adopted son and heir of [[Tuan (Earth-616)|Lord Tuan]], who ruled K'un-Lun in the guise of Yu-Ti, the August Personage in Jade. However, Wendell was driven from K'un-Lun by his brother, [[Nu-An (Earth-616)|Nu-An]], who not only wanted to rule K'un-Lun himself, but who was Wendell's rival for the love of a woman named [[Shakirah (Earth-616)|Shakirah]].{{r|Iron Fist #6}} It was Wendell that Shakirah chose, and she bore him a daughter, [[Miranda Rand-K'ai (Earth-616)|Miranda]]. Wendell found refuge outside K'un-Lun and became a successful businessman in the [[United States of America|United States]]. In his absence, Tuan died and Wendell's brother succeeded him as Yu-Ti, the August Personage in Jade. Wendell married a woman named [[Heather Duncan (Earth-616)|Heather]], who bore him a son, Daniel.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Marvel Knights 2005 Vol 1 1}}

Wendell sought to return to K'un-Lun, which ordinarily was only accessible from Earth through an interdimensional nexus that opened once every ten years. When Daniel was nine, his father traveled to [[Tibet]] along with Heather and his business partner [[Harold Meachum (Earth-616)|Harold Meachum]] in search of the nexus to K'un-Lun. Toppling off a treacherous mountain passage, Daniel dragged his mother and father over the ice shelf with him. While he and his mother landed on a ledge below, his father dangled over the sheer drop of the mountainside and called to his partner for help. Hoping to take over Rand's share of the business, Meachum instead caused him to lose his grip and plunge to his death. Though Meachum offered to help Heather Rand and her son, they spurned him. Attempting to make it back to camp on their own, Heather and her son spied a long suspension bridge as a pack of wolves attacked. Heather tried to hold them off long enough for her son to get to safety and was killed in the effort.{{r|Marvel Premiere #15}}

Soon thereafter, denizens of K'un-Lun found the boy and took him to their city. There Daniel was brought before Yu-Ti, who had secretly plotted the murder of both Wendell and Heather. Yu-Ti apprenticed Daniel to the martial arts master [[Lei-Kung (Earth-616)|Lei Kung the Thunderer]].{{r|Marvel Premiere #16}}

Rand's training under Lei Kung was rigorous. At the age of sixteen, Rand earned the Crown of Fu-Hsi, king of the vipers, vanquished four foes in the ritualistic Challenge of the Many, and defeated [[Shu-Hu (Android) (Earth-616)|Shu-Hu]], a mechanical being whose name means "Lightning."{{r|Marvel Premiere #15}} Rand diligently conditioned his hands by thrusting them into tubs of hot sand, then gravel, and finally rock.{{r|Marvel Premiere #16}}

===Iron Fist===
At age nineteen Rand was given the opportunity to gain the power of the Iron Fist. He was sent to battle the enormous fire-breathing serpent called [[Shou-Lao (Earth-616)|Shou-Lao the Undying]] which lived in a cave outside the city and which ferociously guarded a brazier containing its heart, which had mystically been removed from its body. In their battle, Rand grabbed the serpent's body, which bore a scar which imprinted itself upon Rand's chest. Killing the serpent, Rand plunged his hands into the now unguarded brazier containing Shou-Lao's molten heart when his hands shone with a quasi-mystical force and he earned the title "[[Glossary:Iron Fist|Iron Fist]]," for he could now summon superhuman energy to reinforce the power of blows struck by his hands.{{r|Marvel Premiere #16}}

[[File:Daniel Rand (Earth-616) from Iron Fist Vol 3 1 0001.png|thumb|left|Danny Rand, Iron Fist]]
Declining to stay in K'un-Lun eternally, Rand returned to America when the nexus reopened in order to take vengeance on Meachum for his father's death. While recovering from severe frostbite in the [[Himalayas]], Meachum learned of Rand's training at K'un-Lun and returned to America as an invalid to await Rand. Clad in the ceremonial garb of Iron Fist, Rand finally confronted Meachum, but took pity on the invalid and spared him. Minutes later, however, a [[Ninja (Master Khan) (Earth-616)|mysterious ninja]] murdered Meachum.{{r|Marvel Premiere #18}} Blamed for the murder by Meachum's daughter [[Joy Meachum (Earth-616)|Joy]], Iron Fist undertook the mission of finding the ninja and clearing his own name. Eventually, Iron Fist succeeded in both tasks. During the same time, he accompanied a woman named [[Jade (Earth-616)|Jade]] to [[Feng-Tu]], K'un-Lun's afterlife, where he met his mother, who had taken on the name Silver Dragon and been enslaved by the sorcerer [[Dhasha Khan (Earth-616)|Dhasha Khan]]. While in Feng-Tu, he was killed by the [[Lancelot (Bowman) (Earth-616)|Bowman]] so he could fight Khan as a spirit. After defeating him, Rand was restored to life by Jade.{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #19|24}}

=== Heroes For Hire ===
Iron Fist was befriended by [[Lee Wing (Earth-616)|Professor Lee Wing]] and his daughter [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen]], a private investigator. When she was kidnapped by [[Khan (Earth-616)|Master Khan]], he and Colleen's partner [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] tracked leads about her whereabouts to [[England]], where Iron Fist clashed with [[Henri Sorel (Earth-616)|Radion]]{{r|{{cl|Iron Fist Vol 1 3}}-[[Iron Fist Vol 1 4|4]]}} and [[Scimitar (Earth-616)|Scimitar]].{{r|Iron Fist #5}} He finally discovered Colleen in Khan's fortress in [[Halwan]], where she attacked him under the influence of [[David Angar (Earth-616)|Angar the Screamer]]. Iron Fist managed to free her from the mental control by using his powers to bridge their minds.{{r|Iron Fist #6}} Together, they managed to defeat Angar and Khan, but not before Danny learned the truth about his adopted uncle Nu-An: that he had driven his father from K'un-Lun and that he was responsible for his mother's death.{{r|Iron Fist #7}}

Iron Fist was then framed for the supposed death of [[William Hao (Earth-616)|Bill Hao]] by his brother, the crime-lord [[Robert Hao (Earth-616)|Chaka Khan]].{{r|Iron Fist #9}} With the help of Misty Knight and Colleen Wing, he managed to clear his name and defeat Chaka.{{r|Iron Fist #10}}

Eventually Daniel Rand became the lover of Misty Knight. At the request of her friend [[Nathaniel Alexander Byrd (Earth-616)|Blackbyrd]], he teamed up with [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]], [[Jonathan Hart (Earth-616)|Jack of Hearts]] and [[Hector Ayala (Earth-616)|White Tiger (Hector Ayala)]] to take down the [[Corporation (Earth-616)|Corporation]].{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #31}}

Although Harold Meachum's daughter Joy and his brother [[Ward Meachum (Earth-616)|Ward]] long mistakenly sought vengeance on Iron Fist for Harold's death, Daniel finally made peace with Joy Meachum. Daniel claimed his inheritance as a full partner in Rand-Meachum, Inc., thus becoming a millionaire.<ref>Sometime between {{cl|Iron Fist #9}} and {{cl|Iron Fist #15}}.</ref>

However, Rand allowed Joy Meachum to manage the business. His activities as Iron Fist had led him to become a crime fighter, and eventually he chose to devote his time to acting as the partner of [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]], alias Power Man, in their firm [[Heroes for Hire (Power Man & Iron Fist) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire, Inc]]. Through this firm Cage and Rand accepted jobs as special bodyguards or detectives.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #54}}

During a return visit to K'un-Lun, however, Rand was exposed to deadly radiation and was diagnosed with cancer. Almost immediately after, he was kidnapped by the [[H'ylthri]], ancient alien enemies of K'un-Lun who planned an invasion of Earth. A plant-matter [[Daniel Rand (H'ylthri) (Earth-616)|clone of Rand]] briefly took his place in the real world, unknown to his friends.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #118|119}}

One day "Iron Fist" used his superhuman healing power to try to cure a young boy named Bobby Wright of his terminal disease. The disease was a side effect of the exposure to radiation that enabled Wright to transform himself into an adult superhuman being who called himself Captain Hero. Iron Fist went into a trance outside Wright's hospital room in an attempt to rest after the effort of trying to heal him. In another attempt to help Wright, duplicates of Kree [[Nega-Bands]] were placed on his wrists. As a result Wright suffered intense pain. Transforming into Captain Hero, he struck Iron Fist repeatedly, desperately trying to bring him out of his trance. Misjudging his superhuman strength, Captain Hero instead seemingly killed Iron Fist before disappearing himself. Luke Cage was blamed for the murder, and went on the run instead of facing the law. The hero-for-hire business was effectively dismantled.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #125}}

Some time after this, the alien [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]] duplicated Rand's likeness and fully assumed his identity so as to use the Rand Corporation as well as gain economic control of the Antarctic paradise known as the [[Savage Land]]. This conflicted with the plans of another company, [[Oracle Inc. (Earth-616)|Oracle Inc.]], owned by [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner]]. Namor, [[Namorita Prentiss (Earth-616)|Namorita]], and Misty Knight then confronted Super-Skrull, who, with his plans ruined, abandoned Rand's identity and fled. The assembled heroes soon set out on a search for the real Danny Rand, eventually freeing him from the H'ylthri with the help of Namor and the sorcerer [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]]. Rand then found himself cured of his cancer on account of his chi meditations while in stasis with the H'ylthri.{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #22}}

Following the seeming deaths of most of Earth's heroes at the hands of the sentient psionic menace known as [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], the duo decided to expand the membership of [[Heroes for Hire (Oracle Inc.) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]]. The agency merged with Oracle Inc. - the corporation owned by Prince Namor, the Atlantean Sub-Mariner - to protect the world from danger, for a price. The original [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Human Torch]], Jim Hammond, lined up the jobs; Iron Fist acted as field commander. The team rarely collected its fee, however, and eventually disbanded when Namor saw fit to diffuse Oracle Inc.{{r|Heroes for Hire #1|19}}

Hoping to share the wisdom of his other-dimensional homeworld with humanity, Iron Fist initiated a summoning spell to call K'un-Lun to Earth. Tied to his heartbeat, the kingdom eventually would materialize - merging with whatever city he occupied at the time. But [[Junzo Muto (Earth-616)|Junzo Muto]], teenage leader of the secret cult of martial artists called the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]], forcibly seized the power of the Iron Fist prior to K'un-L’un's arrival. He then drew the hero to [[Japan]] so the kingdom would materialize in the midst of modern-day [[Tokyo]]. Aided by the feral [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Man]] known as [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and a number of the planet's mightiest heroes, Iron Fist put down Junzo's plan and halted the amalgamation of the two cities. However, he was unable to reclaim the power of the Iron Fist.{{r|{{cl|Iron Fist: Wolverine Vol 1 1}}-[[Iron Fist: Wolverine Vol 1 4|4]]}}

===Black Dragon===
Later, one of Iron Fist's and the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]]'s enemies, [[Tilda Johnson (Earth-616)|Nightshade]], resurrected the [[Chiantang (Earth-616)|Black Dragon]] in the hope that they could control and use it against the Black Panther. She set the dragon on a mission to capture Panther's U.S. State Department handler, [[Everett Ross (Earth-616)|Everett K. Ross]]. However, the Black Dragon had plans of his own. Instead of capturing Ross, he switched bodies with Ross, for his own purposes. When this was discovered by the Black Panther, the Panther set out to destroy the Dragon's eggs. Not wishing to engage the Panther directly, the Dragon confronted Iron Fist, restored the power of his iron fist by using a small favor borrowed from the Dragon's gods and creating an imbalance in his psyche that would brainwash Iron Fist into fighting the Panther. By a narrow margin, the Panther was able to render him unconscious, which helped restore him to his right mind. The Dragon then battled both heroes directly and was ultimately defeated.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 #38|40}}

Iron Fist continued to work with Luke Cage. The two investigated a virus attack on the Rand Corporation, leading to a confrontation with the [[B.A.D. Girls, Inc. (Earth-616)|BAD Girls]], [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]].{{r|Cable & Deadpool #21}}

=== New Avengers and Daredevil===
The existence of [[Orson Randall (Earth-616)|Orson Randall]], the previous Iron Fist, was revealed, and Danny and Orson were mysteriously able to share the power of the Iron Fist. Randall taught Danny how to use his powers in different ways than how he has previously.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #4}}{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #5}}{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #6}}

Rand disguised himself as Daredevil to convince the media and the public that [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]] was not the masked vigilante. Rand believed that he had been hired to pose as Daredevil by [[Franklin Nelson (Earth-616)|Foggy Nelson]]. In reality, Nelson had been forced into witness protection and Rand was being manipulated.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 #82|86}}

He was opposed to the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], and joined [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] while still pretending to be Daredevil. While posing as Daredevil, Rand was apprehended by Pro-Registration forces, calling [[Iron Man (Anthony "Tony" Stark)|Tony Stark]] 'Judas' and giving him a silver dollar. He was later freed from the [[Negative Zone]] Prison, joining [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Captain America's team]] for the final battle with Iron Man's forces.{{r|Civil War #2|7}}

After the final battle, Rand returned to his role as Iron Fist and joined the underground [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] alongside fellow former Hero for Hire Luke Cage. He remained in the public eye and in control of Rand-Meachum while, at the same time, in defiance of the Superhuman Registration Act. When Iron Man's registered Avengers had a confrontation with the underground team, they attempted to arrest Danny at work. Jeryn Hogarth defended his client, challenging Stark to produce evidence that Danny was under the Iron Fist mask when they saw him. He also challenged Danny's need to register under the law, claiming he had already registered his hands as deadly weapons due to his kung fu training, and the Superhuman Registration Act was therefore redundant. Legally outmaneuvered, the Avengers initiative were forced to leave Danny alone unless they caught him in the act of breaking the law.{{r|New Avengers #27|30}}

During [[World War Hulk]], he, alongside his teammates [[Maya Lopez (Earth-616)|Echo]] and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Ronin]], tried to protect [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] from [[Elloe Kaifi (Earth-616)|Elloe]] and [[Hiroim (Earth-616)|Hiroim]] of the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]'s [[Warbound (Earth-616)|Warbound]]. They were briefly defeated and imprisoned.{{r|World War Hulk #1|5}}

During the [[Secret Invasion]], Iron Fist, along with the reunited [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and a myriad of other heroes, took a final stand against the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] in an all out battle in [[New York City]].{{r|Secret Invasion #1|8}}

===Thunderbolts===
[[File:Thunderbolts Vol 1 137 Textless.jpg|200px|With Power Man... joining the Thunderbolts?|thumb]]
Later, as Danny attended a meeting concerning Rand Corp's crumbling state, he was ambushed by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] and the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]]. After a short lived battle, Danny was defeated, drugged and kidnapped. He found himself somewhere in the Thunderbolts base being brainwashed by [[Ghost (Earth-616)|Ghost]] and the Iron Patriot to be a member of the Thunderbolts. Osborn used new technology to brainwash Danny, using mentally-induced simulations in which Rand would kill nearly all the New Avengers but couldn't bring himself to kill Luke Cage. Ghost then suggested completely mind-wiping Rand, but Osborn did not want him to lose his skills so he forced Danny to undergo a dangerous procedure in which his mind was further tampered with. Iron Fist assisted in capturing Luke Cage, who later escaped thanks to the Ghost's tampering. Iron Fist soon attacked Luke (who had been assisted in his escape by [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)]], whom he had previously swallowed) and then made it appear that he had killed Cage, allowing the two to escape by surprise.{{r|Thunderbolts #137}}

===Immortal Weapons===
[[File:Immortal Weapons (Earth-616) Iron Man 2.0 Vol 1 6.png|left|thumb|Immortal Weapons]]
[[Davos (Earth-616)|Davos]]' powers were restored by the [[Crane Mother (Earth-616)|Crane Mother]], in which he then started working with [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] while planning to stop Rand-Meachum Inc.'s plan to build a Randrapid train tunnel through the K'un-Lun mountains. Davos then found [[Orson Randall (Earth-616)|Orson Randall]] in [[Bangkok]].{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #1}} He escaped to New York and sent agents disguised as [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|N.Y.P.D.]] to pick him up from the airport, but Randall was able to determine the truth and broke free.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #2}} Davos sent another group after Danny and Orson.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #3}}{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #4}} Davos then attacked Danny and Orson at the [[Rand Building]].{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #5}} However, during the fight, Orson gave his Chi to Danny increasing his powers against Davos. But Lei-Kung and Yu-Ti appeared before them saying that it was time for the Tournament of the Heavenly Cities.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #6}}

At the [[Heart of Heaven]], the [[Immortal Weapons (Earth-616)|Immortal Weapons]] are the champions of the [[Seven Capital Cities of Heaven]]. The warriors consisted of the [[John Aman (Earth-616)|Prince of Orphans]], [[Fat Cobra (Earth-616)|Fat Cobra]], [[Bride of Nine Spiders (Earth-616)|Bride of Nine Spiders]], [[Li Hua (Earth-616)|Tiger's Beautiful Daughter]], and [[Sihing (Earth-616)|Dog Brother #1]]. Each would face each other in various arenas.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #8}} Davos revealed that he was now known as the Steel Phoenix.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #9|10}}{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #12}} Rand then joined the other Immortal Weapons in defending the cities from Hydra.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #13}} Working together, they easily defeated the invading forces.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #14}}

[[File:Immortal Iron Fist Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|right|The Immortal Iron Fist|thumb]]
Later, after saving the Celestial Cities from Hydra's plot to destroy them, Rand came to New York in order to fight against [[Ch'i-Lin]], a mystic beast that kills the Iron Fist on his 33rd birthday and uses his heart to gain access to the dragon's egg, which he attempted to consume at the Rand Corporation. Danny then looked into [[Xaos (Earth-616)|Xaos]] and learned that he was descended from the [[Lightning Lords of Nepal (Earth-616)|Lightning Lords of Nepal]].{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #16}} The other Immortal Weapons soon arrived to help Iron Fist against [[Zhou Cheng (Earth-616)|Zhou Cheng]], the host of Ch'i-Lin.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #19}} At Cheng's penthouse apartment, they found a partial map to the Eighth City, but were nearly killed by a bomb.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #20}} At the gates of the Eighth City, the Weapons focused their chi energies to open the gateway. Due to being weakened by the process, they were unable to fight off a group of monstrous creatures. The Weapons were then brought before their master [[Quan Yaozu (Earth-616)|Changming]]. There, they were forced into gladiatorial combat and were rescued only when they were on the brink of death.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #22}} The only way they could communicate with each other is through Morse code.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #23}} While the Immortal Weapons witnessed a fight between Danny and Changming, who claimed he was the first Iron Fist Quan Yaozu, Tiger's Beautiful Daughter escaped and freed the others. The Weapons then attempted to escape.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #24}} Working together they opened the gateway, but that was Changming's plan all along. By teaming up, the Immortal Weapons were able to escape while trapping the creatures in the Eighth City.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist #25}}

===Fear Itself===
During the [[Fear Itself|Serpent's War]], the doors to the Eighth City were on the verge of being opened again forcing Danny Rand, Fat Cobra, and the other Immortal Weapons to reunite once again in [[Beijing]] with the addition of [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]], who had accompanied the Prince of Orphans from [[Washington, D.C.]] in order to close the gate.{{r|Iron Man 2.0 #5}} However, after being defeated by [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]] and [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]], when the Immortal Weapons started the ceremony, Iron Fist had come under the possession of [[Agamotto (Earth-616)|Agamotto]] which was creating a mystical interference that prevented the Immortal Weapons from closing the gate.{{r|Iron Man 2.0 #6}} After Iron Fist overpowered the other Immortal Weapons, a reluctant War Machine fought him and, due to Doctor Strange infusing some magic to War Machine's gun, defeated Iron Fist by knocking him out, thus ensuring that the ceremony was completed.{{r|Iron Man 2.0 #7}}

Iron Fist was part of the team of [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] that attempted to escort Norman Osborn to a new prison. Norman escaped and re-organized his [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]]. Together with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], Danny battled and defeated [[Thor Odinson (Ragnarok) (Earth-616)|Ragnarok]], the clone of [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 #21|23}}

===Avengers vs X-Men===
Danny sided with the Avengers and was part of the team sent to attack [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] and extract [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]]. He later traveled to [[Wakanda]] to search for Hope after she fled. After the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] split into five pieces Danny was confronted by Lei Kung the Thunderer and Master Yu Ti about the role of the Phoenix in the history of the Iron Fist. Danny decides to bring Hope to K'un Lun as a safe place to train for her role as the Phoenix. He told her the story of a [[Fongji Wu (Earth-616)|red haired Earth girl]] who became the Iron Fist and mastered the power of the Phoenix centuries prior.<!-- Danny and Lei Kung began training her before the prophecy tells Spider-Man to train her. --> Iron Fist participated in every major battle against the [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]]. After the Phoenix Five were defeated, Luke Cage disbanded the New Avengers.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 34}}

===Iron Fist: The Living Weapon===
After the events of the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers/X-Men War]], Danny entered into a relationship with [[Brenda Swanson (Earth-616)|Brenda Swanson]], a reporter who interviewed him about his family. After having sex with Brenda in the [[Rand Building]], Danny was attacked by a cadre of undead ninjas. Moments later, a young monk named [[Pei (Earth-616)|Pei]] stumbled into his apartment and collapsed before telling Danny to return to K'un-Lun.{{r|Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #1}}

Danny later found a portal to K'un-Lun under one of the elevators in the Rand Building. As he made his way back to K'un Lun, he found the city engulfed in flames, destroyed by a mysterious hooded figure.{{r|Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #2}}

One of the survivors blamed him for not being there as K'un-Lun's champion to defend it from invasion. Danny later grabbed the man and angrily demanded to be taken to Lei-Kung. Another survivor lead him to the [[Tree of Immortality]], where Danny finds the [[John Aman (Earth-616)|Prince of Orphans]] waiting for him. He warned Danny not to go near Lei-Kung, but Danny ignored his pleas and found Lei-Kung decapitated. The Prince of Orphans later offered him the choice of life or death, but Danny angrily destroyed the Tree and engaged him in combat. He later recovered and was shocked to learn that the mysterious hooded figure was his own father.{{r|Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #3}}

Danny was forced to use the Iron Fist against his father, but this didn't stagger him and the force broke his hands. He later realized that the mysterious figure wasn't his father and that his identity is the [[Shu-Hu (Android) (Earth-616)|One]].{{r|Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #4}} The undead ninjas later surrounded him, but a mysterious man arrived on a sled and pulled him to safety.{{r|Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #5}}

Danny awoke in a cave, where he met Fooh, a monk from K'un-Lun, and his old friend [[Thunderer (Sparrow) (Earth-616)|Sparrow]]. She tells Danny to stop [[Davos (Earth-616)|Davos]] and the One as they have declared New York City as the New K'un Lun.{{r|Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #6}}

Sparrow and Fooh nursed Danny back to health, and Fooh used some of K'un-Lun's forbidden technologies to forge metallic fists to compensate for the loss of his chi, and sent him to confront the spirit of his mother.{{r|Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #7}} The two of them reconciled and together with Sparrow and Fooh, the three of them went back to New York to finally confront the One.{{r|Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #8}}

They arrived at the Rand Building, where Sparrow faced against Davos and Danny faced the One once again, but was defeated. To counter this, the dead spirit of Fooh told Danny to use the chi of the citizens of K'un-Lun, thus empowering him once again.{{r|Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #9}} Danny again fought the One, but the One utilized the chi to break the barriers of life and death to bring Heather Rand back into the living, but something else came out.{{r|Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #10}}

The mysterious figure was revealed to be Zhu-Kong, the God of Fire and Universal Order. Zhu-Kong tried to punish everyone within New York but the One convinced Danny to merge with him, creating a giant robot. Zhu-Kong and the merged Danny battled it out through the streets of New York. Meanwhile, Davos killed the last incarnation of Shao-Lao and Danny's chi once again was depleted. However, the One gave him his last remaining ounce of chi and Rand once again engaged in combat against Zhu-Kong and defeated him as well.{{r|Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #11}}
