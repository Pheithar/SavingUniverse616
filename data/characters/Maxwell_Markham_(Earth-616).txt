===Origin===
[[File:Maxwell Markham and (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 140 001.jpg|left|thumb]]
Maxwell Markham was a professional wrestler whose brutal tactics caused [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]] to write a scathing editorial calling for an investigation by the wrestling commission. As a consequence of the hearings, his license was revoked. Ten years later, he obtained [[Grizzly's Exo-Skeleton|an exoskeleton]] that augmented his strength from the [[Miles Warren (Earth-616)|Jackal]]. He used this harness to attack the [[Daily Bugle]] in an attempt on revenge against Jameson for ruining his wrestling career, but [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] defeated him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 #139}} The Grizzly then attempted to defeat Spider-Man alongside the Jackal, but was defeated again by Spider-Man and went to prison.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 #140}}

===Re-Match===
After his release, Markham took his exoskeleton to the [[Phineas Mason (Earth-616)|Tinkerer]] for an upgrade. Markham demanded a rematch with Spider-Man so that he could take revenge on Spider-Man and save face among his peers. Spider-Man faked defeat, allowing Grizzly to think he defeated him.{{r|Web of Spider-Man #58}}[[File:Maxwell Markham (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 139 0001.png|left|thumb]]

===Spider-Man Revenge Squad===
He became a member of the Spider-Man Revenge Squad along with [[Brian Hibbs (Earth-616)|Kangaroo]], [[Martin Blank (Earth-616)|Gibbon]] and [[Johnathon Ohnn (Earth-616)|Spot]] but became better known as the "Legion of Losers". Planning only to get back at Spider-Man, Markham and Gibbon were shocked to see Kangaroo and Spot robbing a bank.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #244}}{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #245}} They did capture Spider-Man, but released him, claiming that "He's an all-right guy". Markham and Gibbon teamed up with Spider-Man to capture Kangaroo and Spot. Markham and Gibbon later became crime-fighters and helped Spider-Man (disguised as the [[Bombastic Bag-Man]]) again to stop the [[Lorina Dodson (Earth-616)|White Rabbit]]'s bank robbery.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #246}}{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #253}}{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #256}}

===Going Straight===
At one point, out on probation, he tries to turn his life around. His desire to keep wearing the suit, several accidents and the interference of his criminal friends make his life that much more miserable.{{r|Spider-Man's Tangled Web #19}}

===Secret War===
Markham played an important role in [[Secret War]]. He was suspected in getting his exoskeleton upgraded secretly. Maxwell revealed that the man named the [[Phineas Mason (Earth-616)|Tinkerer]] is doing that.{{r|Secret War #2}}{{r|Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury #1}}

===Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway===
Markham hired [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway (Earth-616)|Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]] after he was accused of a robbery at [[Madison Square Garden]]. He worked with [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] as his defense was to be that he had been seen fighting [[Power Pack (Earth-616)|Power Pack]] in [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]] at the same time. Markham on leaving [[Timely Plaza]], was attacked by [[Eros (Earth-616)|Starfox]] who did not understand that that She-Hulk's employers have taken the villain on as a client. Grizzly was knocked out by Starfox.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 2 #6}}

===Hood Gang===
The [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]] sent Markham to kill the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]].

[[File:Maxwell Markham (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 573 0001.jpg|left|thumb]]
[[Stephen Colbert (Earth-616)|Stephen Colbert]] was a candidate for [[President of the United States]] who ran Third Party. Stephen noticed how few people where in the crowd. He gave up and took off his jacket and tie and was Stephen Colbert no more. He saw [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] battling Grizzly. He tried to help but Spider-Man told him that it wasn't his fight. Spider-Man took him to a nearby building. Spider-Man then continued with his battle with the criminal. Stephen Colbert pushed a statue off of the building and it hit the Grizzly on the head. Spider-Man thanked him for his help and gave him a ride home. In the end he won the popular vote but lost to [[Barack Obama (Earth-616)|Barack Obama]] in Electoral votes.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #573}}

===Thunderbolts===
Markham was recruited by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] and inducted into the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]]. He also underwent a number of augmentation procedures and now possesses superhuman powers without the use of his exoskeleton. During this time, Grizzly started wearing a coat with a bear-shaped hood on it instead of his usual exoskeleton bear suit.{{r|Thunderbolts #139|140}} He and the team go on a mission against the [[Agents of Atlas (Earth-616)|Agents of Atlas]]. Grizzly is also made the commander of a squadron of [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (Earth-616)|B.A.T.F.E.]] agents.{{r|Agents of Atlas Vol 2 #2}}{{r|Agents of Atlas Vol 2 #5}} He was with the team when they battled [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]].{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 4 #4}} Grizzly also joined the team in their mission to retrieve [[Gungnir (Spear)|Gungnir]] the spear of [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] during the [[Siege]] of [[Asgard]].{{r|Thunderbolts #141|142}} He and the other Thunderbolts are betrayed by [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)]].{{r|Thunderbolts #143}}

===Deadpool===
Grizzly encountered [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] in Las Vegas using a battle suit under the name "Wildcard" and working with [[Jack Hammer (Earth-616)|Weasel]]. Unbeknownst to Weasel, Deadpool secretly presented Grizzly with a proposition he had for him. Grizzly managed to escape, and later, when Weasel and Deadpool met with the casino owners, Deadpool revealed that he was in fact Wildcard, much to Weasel's fury. Later, Wade persuaded Weasel to switch suits so that all the praise Wildcard received would be for Weasel's good deeds. Weasel agreed to the plan, and the two once again faced off with Grizzly, now back again and attempting to steal millions of dollars in the casino's counting room. In the ensuing battle, Weasel fought Grizzly in the Wildcard suit while Deadpool sipped drinks as The House.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 #23}} Unfortunately, everyone thought Weasel was the one in The House suit drinking Lime Rickeys, and worst of all, Deadpool ran off with Grizzly and the cash. So when Deadpool told the casino bosses that Weasel took off with the money because he wasn't getting any respect, they all believed him. They also believed him when he told them that Weasel would be returning first thing in the morning. Meanwhile, Weasel talked on the phone with [[Blind Al (Althea) (Earth-616)|Blind Al]], seeking advice, and resolved to take Deadpool down, against Blind Al's protests, and then spotted an explosion in the distance. As it turned out, the explosion was caused by Deadpool back at the casino with Grizzly, attempting to rob the vault. While Grizzly headed for the vault himself, Weasel arrived in the Wildcard suit and confronted Deadpool. Deadpool asked Weasel to join him. Weasel refused and seemingly killed Deadpool by blowing his head off. Grizzly ended up locked in the casino vault, though still with the money. The casino owners still thought that Weasel was the one in The House suit, so everyone ended up cheering for him as Grizzly was arrested.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 #25}}

===Bruin===
[[Roderick Kingsley (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]] later gave an enhanced version of one of Grizzly's old exoskeleton bear suits to [[Bruin (Earth-616)|Bruin]] in order to build his reputation. He, [[Blaze (Hobgoblin) (Earth-616)|Blaze]] and [[Devil-Spider (Earth-616)|Devil-Spider]] took part in a heist until they encountered [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Spider-Man (Otto Octavius/"Peter Parker")]] in the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]].{{r|Superior Spider-Man #24}}

===Supervillains Anonymous===
Markham later attended a support group called Supervillains Anonymous that was held at a church and also attended by [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]], [[Hippo (Earth-616)|Hippo]], [[Roger Gocking (Earth-616)|Porcupine]], [[Lester Verde (Earth-616)|Dr. Bong]], [[Norton Fester (Earth-616)|Looter]], [[Desmond Charne (Earth-616)|Mirage]], and others. At another Supervillains Anonymous meeting, Grizzly and Looter talked about their run-ins with Spider-Man.{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man #11}}

===Ant-Man Security Solutions===
Markham went to Miami to take revenge on Ant-Man due to his betrayal during [[Siege]], unaware he had targeted [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Scott Lang]] instead of [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Eric O'Grady]], who was dead. After the misunderstanding was cleared up, Lang offered Grizzly a place at his new company, [[Ant-Man Security Solutions (Earth-616)|Ant-Man Security Solutions]].{{r|Ant-Man Vol 1 2}}

Grizzly and his coworker [[Samuel Saxon (Earth-616)|Machinesmith]] eventually left Ant-Man's side and returned to villainy after being called up to join the [[Army of Evil (Earth-616)|Army of Evil]], a contingent of supervillains tasked with attacking Manhattan as part of a plan of conquest by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]].{{r|Secret Empire: Brave New World Vol 1 1}}
