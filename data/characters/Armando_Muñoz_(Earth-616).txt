===Origin===
Armando was born different from other children. By age four, he was bald, his arms were longer than normal, and his eyes seemed to change. [[Hector Muñoz (Earth-616)|His father]] abandoned them around this time, and [[Misses Muñoz (Earth-616)|his mother]] blamed Darwin for his mutation.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}}

He grew up in the face of rejection, with even his own mother despising him, but he didn't hate her for that. He did everything he could to make her love him. A day came when he was asked to take an IQ test. Unknown to anyone at the time, Armando's desire to impress his mother subconsciously activated his mutant power and allowed him to test off the charts. He was quickly enrolled in a renowned boarding school, the [[Biltmore Academy for Advanced Education]], but he was sent away mostly because his mother still hated him.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}}

Although his teachers loved him, he was bullied constantly by other students. One day the bullies put his head in the toilet and Armando noticed he could breathe underwater. He lifted his head out and began fighting back, feeling his arms become tough, almost like cement when he punched them. The bullies fled and Armando never brought up what had happened.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}}

His mother then became a heavy smoker. One night she fell asleep with one of her cigarettes still lit, accidentally setting their house on fire. Armando carried her out, unaffected by the flames to the astonishment of firefighters and paramedics. Tests were done at the hospital, and scientists were brought in. Armando was told he was a mutant and was nicknamed ''"Darwin, the Evolving Boy"'' (after [[Charles Darwin (Earth-616)|Charles Darwin]]) because he seemed to adapt to every condition the scientists could think of. For example, they placed him in a pitch-black room and he gained night vision. There was even a lengthy report that was published about Armando.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}}

Unfortunately, his mother continued to reject him, denying that she could ever give birth to such a thing. Dejected, he attempted to commit suicide by jumping off the roof. Instead, he became so light and soft that he almost bounced when he landed on the ground. After talking about what happened with the school psychiatrist, he was told that 'someone who works with other kids like him' had read about Armando and was interested in meeting him. This person turned out to be [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggert]].{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}}

===X-Men===
Moira MacTaggert recruited Armando as one of her "fosters". He was in the first team, along with [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]], [[Petra Kristensen (Earth-616)|Petra]], and [[Suzanne Chan (Earth-616)|Sway]] to attempt to rescue the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] from [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 4}}

While Petra and Sway were killed by Krakoa, Darwin and Vulcan were swallowed in the earth by a combination of Sway and Petra's dying powers. Darwin absorbed the remains of the two girls and then converted himself into energy to fuse together with Vulcan. This gave Vulcan the powers of Darwin, Petra, and Sway.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 6}}

===M-Day & Deadly Genesis===
[[File:Armando Muñoz (Earth-616) from X-Men Deadly Genesis Vol 1 6 001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Darwin recovering]]
Years later, [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]] managed to expel Darwin's presence from Vulcan, who then took off for space. While dealing with the shocking revelations of the truth about Krakoa and Vulcan, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] found out that Darwin was still in fact alive. He was brought back to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]], where Beast determined Darwin was now a being of pure energy. While not conscious, he was shown to still have brain activity and was still alive, located at the X-Mansion. Once separated from Vulcan, Darwin's abilities caused him to develop a physical form once more.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 1|6}}

===The Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire===
When the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] (including [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]], [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], Marvel Girl, [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]]) left to go hunt down Vulcan and stop him from destroying the [[Shi'ar]], it was revealed that the Professor brought Darwin with them with hope that his friendship with Vulcan would help. When Shi'ar agents abducted Professor X, Darwin followed, and secretly jumped onto their spacecraft as it fled.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 476}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 486|486]]}}

After successfully rescuing Xavier from his captors, Darwin was well on his way to freedom when [[D'ken Neramani (Earth-616)|D'Ken]] was revealed to be alive and well. Recaptured by the Imperium guards, Darwin failed in his attempt to rescue his mentor and reluctantly accepted Vulcan's offer of becoming Best Man at his and [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]]'s wedding.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 476}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 486|486]]}}

Though obviously against the union, Darwin attended the wedding - albeit in shackles - and was caught in the crossfire when the X-Men and [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]] attacked. Fearing his great day to be completely ruined by the interference, Vulcan trapped Xavier within the [[M'kraan Crystal]]. Naturally fearing for his mentor's safety, Darwin followed Xavier into the depths of the crystal and rescued him. He was taken to the X-Men's spaceship with Professor X and [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Lilandra Neramani]] sent the ship on its way back to [[Earth]].{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 485}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 486|486]]}}

===World War Hulk===
Darwin was one of the X-Men who heeded the call for help when [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] came to the Xavier Institute. While fighting the Hulk he evolved the ability to absorb gamma radiation. Darwin attempted to absorb gamma radiation from the Hulk only to find that the Hulk's gamma radiation supply was far more than he could drain. His body then determined the best way to confront the Hulk was to not confront the Hulk at all, and Darwin gained teleportation powers which promptly teleported him out of the Hulk's path of destruction.{{r|{{cl|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 2}}-[[World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 3|3]]}}

===Messiah Complex===
Darwin reappeared along with the X-Men and fought against the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]], [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]], [[Predator X]], and [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]].{{r|Messiah Complex}}

===X-Factor Investigations===
Sometime after [[Messiah Complex|the birth of the]] [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|first mutant]] since [[Decimation|M-Day]], Darwin went in search of Professor Xavier because of rumors that he was alive again. While searching, Darwin encountered [[Nogor (Earth-616)|Nogor the Talisman]], a [[Deviant Skrull|Skrull]] impersonating [[Longshot (Mojoverse)|Longshot]]. While in [[Detroit]], the pair were attacked by [[Jazinda Kl'rt-Spawn (Earth-616)|Jazinda]] and [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] who were trailing Nogor.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #33|34}}{{r|She-Hulk Vol 2 31}}

Meanwhile, [[Hector Muñoz (Earth-616)|Darwin's father]] hired [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations]] to help him find Darwin because he felt bad for walking out on him and his mother when he was younger.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #33|34}} After reuniting father and son, it was revealed that Hector actually wanted Darwin only to hand him over to the mysterious Karma Project. Darwin was subsequently saved by X-Factor, and agreed to join the team.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #35|38}}

After joining X-Factor, Darwin helped to save [[Lenore Wilkinson (Earth-616)|Lenore]] from the assassination attempts of [[James Madrox (Cortex) (Earth-616)|Cortex]],{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #41|50}} relocated to [[New York City]],{{r|X-Factor #200}} rescued the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]] from [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]],{{r|X-Factor #200|202}} and fought [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar Trask]] and his [[Mutant Response Division (Earth-616)|MRD]].{{r|X-Factor #203|206}}

[[File:Armando Muñoz (Earth-616) from X-Factor Vol 1 212 001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Darwin with the powers of [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]]]]
After inadvertently handing [[Pip Gofern (Earth-616)|Pip the Troll]] over to [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]], the X-Factor crew journeyed to [[Las Vegas]] to rescue him.{{r|X-Factor #207}} In Vegas, the team encountered Hela's [[Draugr (Race)|undead warriors]]. With help from [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], the team held their own, but the key to winning the battle was Darwin taking on gaining Hela's powers and using them against her.{{r|X-Factor #212}}

===Lone Warrior===
Unfortunately, taking on Hela's death powers had negative effects on Darwin, who chose to leave the team for a sabbatical.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 213}} While wandering in the desert, Darwin experienced a dream or vision during which he battled the dragon-like [[Sirrush]] and encountered a sheriff named [[Tier Sinclair (Earth-Unknown)|Tier]], who claimed to be the [[Tier Sinclair (Earth-616)|son]] of [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Rahne Sinclair]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 214}} Armed with this unsettling information, Darwin began a trek back to New York to warn his friends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/x-position-peter-david/|title=X-POSITION: Peter David|work=CBR|first=George|last=Tramountanas|date=23 February 2011|accessdate=27 July 2011}}</ref>{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 242}}

During his sojourn, Darwin began hearing voices telling him about Tier, and Darwin decided to kill the child himself instead of approaching his former comrades. Darwin began hunting the child, but was prevented by Tier's guardian, [[Jack Russell (Earth-616)|Werewolf by Night]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 242}}

In [[Pennsylvania (State)|Pennsylvania]], Darwin had successfully incapacitated Werewolf by Night, and had cornered Tier, only to be thwarted by the interference of [[Vanora (Earth-7153)|Vanora]] and [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]]. Although momentarily caught off guard by Rictor's restored mutant powers, Darwin remained determined to continue to track Tier and kill him.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 242}}

Compelled by forces beyond his understanding, Darwin continued to track Tier to [[New York City]] where Tier tried to meet with X-Factor. However, when Darwin arrived at [[X-Factor Investigations Headquarters (Funeral Home)|X-Factor Investigations Headquarters]], he lacked the nerve to actually kill Tier.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 250}} Because he was unable to kill Tier to avert the [[Hell on Earth War]], Darwin elected to rejoin X-Factor to fight the [[Hell Lords (Earth-616)|Hell Lords]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 251|256}}

After the Hell on Earth War, Darwin was separated from the others and traveled back to [[Las Vegas]] to find Hela and force her to fix him. While searching for Hela, Darwin encountered a recently resurrected [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]]. The pair had a one-night stand. Afterward, Hela found Darwin, but he refused her help.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 261}}

===Dawn of X===
Following the establishment of a mutant country in [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] by Charles Xavier, Darwin became one of the countless mutants to settle in this new nation. When a group of X-Men were sent to The Vault, a place where anyone trapped inside could remain there for subjectively thousands of years, to capture [[Serafina (Earth-616)|Serafina]], the three mutants selected for the mission were Darwin, [[Everett Thomas (Earth-616)|Synch]], and [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|Wolverine (Laura)]] since they would be able to survive the temporal changes inside it. As soon as the three entered the Vault, they lost touch with the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 5}}

During their first day, while engaging the Children of the Vault in battle, Wolverine and Synch killed most of their foes while Darwin's head got caught in a water bubble from [[Sangre (Children of the Vault) (Earth-616)|Sangre]]. After seeing her teammates killed, [[Aguja (Earth-616)|Aguja]] angrily killed herself by projecting a force field that destroyed everything around her in an attempt to kill her foes.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 18}}

However, Darwin and his teammates recovered, with Darwin recovering due to his adaptation powers. The team then spent 100 years inside the Vault gathering intelligence on the Children. Darwin's adaptation powers slowed or prevented him from aging and learned that City could resurrect any Children that were killed through cloning in order to continuously evolve them. City became interested in Darwin's power and captured him so it could learn how to create a new generation of Children. Wolverine was also captured. After Synch fled and returned to the Vault, with 100 years passing by, he rescued Wolverine, but during his rescue of Darwin, Darwin was killed by City so it could use his powers to create a new generation of Children. Synch and Wolverine were later killed by the Children, but Synch was able to make telepathic contact with [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|X]] and ensure everything they learned about the Vault was passed onto his resurrected form. Wolverine and Darwin were also resurrected.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 19}}

| Powers                  = 
Darwin is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] with an extremely malleable physiology, including:
* '''''Superior Adaptation:''''' Darwin's powers of self-protection offers continuous circumstantial evolution. Darwin is able to adapt to any situation. His reactive mutation adjusts his capabilities to his environment. Examples of such manifestations include receiving functioning gills after being submerged in water,{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}}{{r|Nation X: X-Factor Vol 1 1}} gaining night vision after being in the dark for several seconds,{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}}-[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 3|3]]}} being able to survive without oxygen when in space, his skin becoming fireproof when it is exposed to flames,{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}}-[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 3|3]]}} his body becoming pure energy,{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 6}} his intelligence increasing itself or the understanding of the Shi'ar language by looking at it in written form. However, his powers do not always take the effect he desires.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 242}} For example, during his fight with the Hulk, his body teleports him away from the battle rather than supplying a power that would allow him to defeat the Hulk.{{r|{{cl|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 2}}-[[World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 3|3]]}}
** '''''Immortality or Near Immortality:''''' As a byproduct of Darwin's continuous evolution, he may, in fact, be immortal. He can survive indefinitely in harsh conditions and/or without water or nourishment. Darwin even survived [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela's]] death touch.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 212}} He also survived 200 years while in the Vault, a location where time moved much more quickly than time in the outside world.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 19}}
** '''''Proactive Adaptation:''''' After his battle with Hela, Darwin became able to trigger mutations that could proactively ensure his survival sometimes even by affecting others around him.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 242}}
* '''''Death Harbinger:''''' Although many of his death deity adaptations have gone, Darwin still claims to be a death harbinger.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 212}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 261}} Darwin does appear to be able to detect when someone is dying{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 250|251}} and still carries much of the darkness of Hela with him.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 213|214}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 242}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 261}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Powers	
| body = Although some of Darwin's adaptations are longer lasting, most are only temporary changes. Some of these temporary adaptations include:
* Darwin's intelligence can increase when needed.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}}
* When exposed to water, Darwin often adapts aquatic evolutions including gills and webbed hands.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}}-[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 3|3]]}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 33}}{{r|Nation X: X-Factor Vol 1 1}}

* When his home caught on fire, Darwin became fireproof with slick, wet skin to rescue [[Misses Muñoz (Earth-616)|his mother]] and escape.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}} He has had similar evolutions when exposed to other fires.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 3}}
* When placed in darkness, Darwin has evolved to see in the dark with clarity.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}}-[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 3|3]]}}
* After learning that he was a mutant and being rejected by his mother, Darwin tried to commit suicide by stepping off a building, but his body became light and soft enough that he almost bounced as he touched the pavement.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 2}}
* When he seemingly died battling [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], Darwin transferred his mind into [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]] until they returned to Earth and Darwin recreated his own body out of pure energy.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 6}}
* During a fall, Darwin's body evolved to a rubbery form to survive the impact.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 476}}
* To survive in the vacuum of space, Darwin evolved to not need oxygen while his skin and internal organs increased in density.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 478|481}}
* Darwin once evolved to be able to survive direct laser exposure with only a little discomfort.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 482}}
* Darwin survived entering the [[M'kraan Crystal]] to save [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]].{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 485}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 486|486]]}}
* At times of great danger, Darwin has involuntarily teleported himself away from the imminent threat.{{r|{{cl|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 2}}-[[World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 3|3]]}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 205}}
* When threatened with a knife by a gang in [[Detroit]], Darwin's neck and skin became rubbery and tough.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 33}}
* When he was shot in close range by [[Jazinda Kl'rt-Spawn (Earth-616)|Jazinda]], Darwin's torso deflected the bullet back at her.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 2 31}}
* While being led around the [[Skrulls|Skrull]] [[Nogor (Earth-616)|Nogor the Talisman]] impersonating [[Longshot (Mojoverse)|Longshot]], Darwin developed the ability to jolt the Skrull with physical contact forcing him to reveal his true form.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 2 31}}
* When shot with a blaster by Nogor the Talisman, Darwin's body absorbed the energy.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 34}}
* When shot by a nerve disruptor, Darwin evolved into a sponge with no nervous system to avoid death.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 41}}
* Because excessive amounts of alcohol are harmful, Darwin's metabolism increases preventing him from ever becoming drunk.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 44}}
* To escape a [[James Madrox (Cortex) (Earth-616)|Cortex]]-possessed [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]], Darwin's body became bloated sludgy slim.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 46}}
* Darwin somehow survived being seemingly crushed by falling [[Sentinels (Earth-1191)|Sentinel]] debris.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 47}}
* When punched full-force by [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]], Darwin lost all feeling above his neck and seems to have allowed his skull to become soft.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 200}}
* When shot by the [[Mutant Response Division (Earth-616)|MRD]], Darwin evolved to absorb and digest the bullets.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 204|205}}
* After touching [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]], Darwin became a death deity and gained powers similar to Hela including immortality, [[Asgardians|Asgardian physiology]] and control over life and death.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 212}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 251}}
* While wandering through the desert, Darwin evolved to no longer require water.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 214}}
* While hunting [[Tier Sinclair (Earth-616)|Tier]] to avert the [[Hell on Earth War|apocalypse]], Darwin evolved to no longer need sleep.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 242}}
* One of Darwin's proactive adaptation allowed him to force [[Jack Russell (Earth-616)|Jack Russell]] from his [[Werewolves|werewolf form]] into his [[Homo sapiens|human form]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 242}}
* When thrown off a cliff by [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]], Darwin began to sprout wings, but hit the ground before the wings could break free of his costume. To survive, he instead turned to stone.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 242}}
* Darwin somehow survived being hit by a car.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 250}}
* Darwin somehow survived the explosion that destroyed the [[X-Factor Investigations Headquarters (Funeral Home)|X-Factor Investigations Headquarters]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 250|251}}
* To survive a barrage of a hundred bullets, Darwin's body transformed into a jell-o-like substance.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 261}}
