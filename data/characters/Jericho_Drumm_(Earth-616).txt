===Early Life===
Jericho returned to his native city of [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]] after twelve years of education and practice in the [[United States of America|United States]]. His brother [[Daniel Drumm (Earth-616)|Daniel Drumm]] had become the local [[Glossary:Houngan|Houngan]], but was dying from the spell of a rival ''bokor'' who claimed he served the evil serpent god [[Dam-Ayido Wede (Earth-616)|Damballah]]. Before he died, Daniel made his brother vow to visit [[Charles LeJeune (Earth-616)|Papa Jambo]], who had instructed Daniel in the arts of a Houngan.{{r|Doctor Voodoo: The Origin of Jericho Drumm #1}}

===Brother Voodoo===
After only a few weeks Jericho had reached a proficiency in voodoo even greater than his brother's. To further increase his power, Papa Jambo performed a rite that summoned Daniel Drumm's spirit back from the dead and joined it with Jericho's own. With his successor being found and ready to take his place, Papa Jambo died. Calling himself Brother Voodoo, Jericho defeated the cult and has proven himself the supreme Houngan of Haiti. He learned that it was not the true Damballah responsible for his brother's death, but a [[Damballah (Demon) (Earth-616)|spawn]] of the [[Elder Gods of Earth|Elder God]] [[Set (Earth-616)|Set]].{{r|Strange Tales #169|170}}

Brother Voodoo investigated [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]]'s attempt to create a form of [[zombie]] and has fought a rival voodoo practitioner who was posing as [[Baron Samedi (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|Baron Samedi]].{{r|Strange Tales #171}}

[[Loralee Tate (Earth-616)|Loralee Tate]] was kidnapped by the [[Cult of the Dark Lord (Earth-616)|Cult of the Dark Lord]]{{r|Strange Tales #172|173}} to be used as a sacrifice in order to rejuvenate the cult leader's mother, Mama Limbo. She was rescued by Brother Voodoo.{{r|Zombie Vol 1 6}} Afterwards, her father, a high ranking police officer, forbade her to have any further contact with Brother Voodoo, fearing that he was becoming a bad influence on her.{{r|Tales of the Zombie Vol 1 10}}

===Spider-Man & Dracula===
Voodoo teamed up with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] to battle [[Moondog the Malicious (Earth-616)|Moondog the Malicious]], a member of the [[Vodū|Loa]]. Working together they banished him before he could kill [[Gail Paris (Earth-616)|Gail Paris]].{{r|Marvel Team-Up #24}}

In [[Brazil]], he helped [[Frank Drake (Earth-616)|Frank Drake]] battle [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]]. He also helped Drake get over his self-doubt and inspired him to continue his quest to destroy Dracula.{{r|Tomb of Dracula #34|37}}

===Werewolf by Night & The Thing===
Jericho later helped the [[Jack Russell (Earth-616)|Werewolf by Night]] deal with [[Glitternight (Earth-616)|Doctor Glitternight]].{{r|Werewolf by Night #38}} He used a spell that allowed his brother Daniel's spirit to control the actions of the werewolf. They battled hordes of zombies, so they could enter the Black Egg, which was the source of Glitternight's power. Daniel was sent into the egg and helped his brother in battle by working together to defeat Glitternight. After the battle his brother returned to his spirit form.{{r|Werewolf by Night #40|41}}

As a result of the disappearance of several members of the black community, Voodoo teamed up with the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]. The mystery led them to [[Uganda]] where they had to fight Voodoo priest, W'Sulli, who was using a vampire to do his bidding and was also working with [[Kinji Obatu (Earth-616)|Kinji Obatu]]. Together, they took down both of the criminals and freed the prisoners.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #41}}

===Damballah's Wangal & Moon Knight===
Brother Voodoo eventually succumbed to the lure of power that Damballah's wangal represented. Upon Jericho wearing it, the god Damballah took over Daniel's soul, burned down the mansion, and apparently slew [[Bambu (Earth-616)|Bambu]]. He traveled to [[New York City]] in order to attempt to take over the mind and body of Earth's Sorcerer Supreme, [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], who eventually freed Brother Voodoo of Damballah's influence and re-confined the evil god to the wangal.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 48}}

[[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]] came to Haiti and they teamed up to take down [[Grand Bois (Earth-616)|Grand Bois]] who was raising a zombie army.{{r|Moon Knight #21}} Drumm was later attacked by [[Josué Pétion (Earth-616)|Doctor Friday]] and turned into a mindless zombie.{{r|Marc Spector: Moon Knight #6}} Moon Knight was able to free his mind and together they took down the Haitian crime lord.{{r|Marc Spector: Moon Knight #7}}

===Zombies vs. Vampires & Losing Loralee===
[[File:Doctor Voodoo Avenger of the Supernatural Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
After [[Marie Laveau (Earth-616)|Marie Laveau]] used the [[Vampiric Verses]], Brother Voodoo was forced to summon a zombie army to assist Doctor Strange, [[Clea (Earth-616)|Clea]],[[Rintrah (Earth-616)|Rintrah]], and [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]].{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #16|17}} Although they were able to defeat the vampires, the zombies then had to be destroyed so they could be at peace.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #18}}

Drumm was desperate to get Loralee Tate back and tried to use magic to make her fall in love with him. Realizing this was a lie, the two then ended their relationship.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes Vol 2 1}}

Without, Lorelee, Jericho needed to regain his focus and wrote a book, "Do You Voodoo, I Do!" and went on a book tour with "Sister Voodoo" an actress he hired to play his new super-hero partner, alongside her "son" Voodoo Chile.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Horror 2005 Vol 1 1}}<ref>Events described here are based on {{cl|Marvel Age Annual Vol 1 3}}.This is likely based on, instead of being fully set in this universe as there are variations between the Handbook entry and the actual comic, (It was a new comic book series he was promoting not a book, which I cannot find another source which lists the title as described) and there is no evidence the rest of the comic is set on 616, especially when they introduce characters native to [[Earth-1287]]. These could also be actors, but Occam's razor leads me to believe this is simply all on Earth-77640</ref>

===Daredevil & Lilith Drake===
He helped [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] when [[Calypso Ezili (Earth-616)|Calypso]] turned him into a living zombie and he had to fight to free himself from her control.{{r|Daredevil #311}}

[[Lilith Drake (Earth-616)|Lilith Drake]] asked Drumm to help her with her increased cravings for blood since the vampires' return. He did so, while making her promise to assist him later on.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 84}}

Brother Voodoo sensed that the [[Scarecrow]] was making zombies.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 82}} [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|John Blaze]] and [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] were angered that the Scarecrow had taken the body of [[Barbara Ketch (Earth-616)|Barbara Ketch]].{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 #83|84}} Working along with Lilith, they battled him. However, blood from the respective packs of animals Lilith summoned and the crows from the Scarecrow made Lilith go crazy again. She left the group, but Scarecrow was eventually stopped by Drumm and the others.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 85}}

===Blade & Heroes for Hire===
[[Deacon Frost (Earth-616)|Deacon Frost]] teamed up with Marie Laveau to take over mafia crime in New Orleans as a staging area for greater conquests. Deacon captured [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]], [[Hannibal King (Earth-616)|Hannibal King]], and Brother Voodoo to establish his rep among the undead in a power grab. The heroes freed themselves from the trap and Blade battled Deacon Frost to a stalemate. Deacon escaped, and Blade vowed to hunt him down.{{Citation}}

Brother Voodoo was called in to help revive [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], who had spent his life-force saving [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]].{{r|Heroes for Hire #13}}

===Black Panther & Gambit===
He also assisted [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]] after [[Erik Killmonger (Earth-616)|Killmonger]] was resurrected and T'Challa found himself attacked by [[Nightmare (Earth-616)|Nightmare]].{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 #17|22}}

[[File:Gambit Vol 4 9 Textless.jpg|right|thumb]]
Jericho developed a sense of protectiveness about New Orleans, eagerly identifying himself as its local superhero. Jericho cautiously observed the plots involving the mystic [[Inficio Aquilus]], the first tarot card deck, and later helped the X-Man [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] against a zombie army raised by [[Antoinelle Arceneaux (Earth-616)|Antoinelle Arceneaux]].{{r|Gambit Vol 4 #3|11}}

===Secret Invasion===
Brother Voodoo became involved with the supernatural "[[Howling Commandos (S.H.I.E.L.D.) (Earth-616)|Howling Commandos]]" operation of the espionage agency [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]],{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #2|6}} and registered with the government in accordance with the [[Superhuman Registration Act]].{{r|New Avengers #29|30}}{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report #1}}

At some point, he was replaced by a [[Deviant Skrull|Skrull]]. While Black Panther was fighting [[Erik Killmonger (Earth-616)|Erik Killmonger]], the Skrull Brother Voodoo revealed himself when he attempted to kill [[Cannibal (Earth-616)|Cannibal]], whom he deemed to be a threat. However, the two killed each other in the struggle and the discovery of "Brother Voodoo's" true form revealed the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] to the Black Panther, allowing him time to prepare.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 #12|13}}

===Deadpool & Wendigo Invasion===
[[File:Jericho Drumm (Earth-616) from Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 48 001.jpg|right|thumb]]

Drumm helped the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]], [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]], and Moon Knight fight a [[Wendigo]] invasion in [[Las Vegas]] while [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] and the [[Lady Liberators (Earth-616)|Lady Liberators]] were fighting the [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]].{{r|Hulk Vol 2 9}}

===Sorcerer Supreme & Divas===
Agamotto appeared to Jericho through his [[Eye of Agamotto|Eye]]. The Eye left Strange after magically showing him and the [[New Avengers]] nearly thirty-candidates who would possibly replace Strange, reaching Voodoo. Because he possessed the Eye, along with Strange's former garb, Drumm became the new [[Sorcerer Supreme]] of [[Earth-616]]. The possession of the Eye indicated that Jericho possesses a pure heart and a clean soul. Drumm appeared in New Orleans to intervene in the desperate battle between [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]] and [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|The Hood]] against Doctor Strange with the New Avengers.{{r|New Avengers #53|60}}

He helped [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Patsy Walker]], [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Monica Rambeau]], [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Felicia Hardy]], and [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Angelica Jones]] when they teamed up to fight crime.{{r|Marvel Divas #1|4}}

===Avenger of the Supernatural & Zombieverse===
[[Marinette-Bwa-Chech (Earth-616)|Marinette-Bwa-Chech]] a "petro loa" escaped the Bondye and inhabited the body of a man who sought help at a New Orleans medical clinic to ambush and attack Drumm.{{r|{{cl|Doctor Voodoo: Avenger of the Supernatural Vol 1 1}}-[[Doctor Voodoo: Avenger of the Supernatural Vol 1 5|5]]}}

He offered Deadpool help in getting [[Wade Wilson (Earth-2149)|Headpool]] back to the [[Earth-2149|Zombieverse]] and opened a mystical portal for him to get there.{{r|Deadpool: Merc with a Mouth #7|8}}

===Doomwar & Death===
He was one of the many heroes who battled [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] during Doomwar.{{r|Doomwar #6}}

When Agamotto was cast out of the [[Vishanti]] and had most of his powers stripped from him, he attacked the New Avengers in order to reclaim the Eye of Agamotto from Doctor Voodoo as it was the only artifact that could defeat him.{{r|{{cl|New Avengers Vol 2 1}}-[[New Avengers Vol 2 5|5]]}} Jericho used the Eye to defeat Agamotto, but the Eye was destroyed and his life was lost in the process.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 6}}

===Chaos War & Resurrection===
He was one of the many heroes who battled the [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (Earth-616)|Chaos King]].{{r|Chaos War #1|2}}

When the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] was affected by an inversion spell which altered her moral axis, she set out to murder Doctor Doom for the manipulations she was victim of.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #6}} In order to stop her, Doctor Doom made a Faustian pact with a demigod to resurrect Doctor Voodoo, as he and his brother Daniel were the only ones capable of possessing Wanda, in order to make her "cooperate" in the conjuration of a reinversion spell.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #8}}

In the wake of the conflict, Doctor Voodoo joined the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]].{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #9}}

===Avengers Unity Division===
As the Unity Division became increasingly fractured during the second Superhero Civil War and the threat of the [[Terrigenesis]] cloud, Drumm was shocked to learn that his brother had chosen to side with the Hand, seeking his own resurrection even at the cost of becoming their pawn, while going so far as to offer them the corpse of the recently-deceased Bruce Banner to become their agent of destruction.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 14}} Voodoo was able to escape his brother and warn the Unity Division of this threat, but while they failed to stop the Hulk's resurrection,{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 15}} Drumm was able to create a spell that allowed him to enter the Hulk's mind once his teammates had worn him down. The Hand's mystical forces appeared to Drumm in astral form while in Banner's mind and offered to restore his brother to him if he would let them keep Banner, but Drumm declared that he would choose his 'brother' in the form of his friend Bruce, informing the Hand that Daniel had made his choice, purging the Hulk of the Hand's influence and allowing Banner to die again.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 17}}

===Empyre===
Drumm answered the call to join the Avengers during the threat of the [[Empyre (Earth-616)|Empyre]] led [[Cotati]].{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 1}}
