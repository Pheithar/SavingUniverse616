===Origins===
Not much is known about the [[Inhumans (Race)|Inhuman]] named '''Kadlec''', also known as the '''Seeker'''. His only known relative is his twin brother [[Uys (Earth-616)|Uys]]. {{r|Fantastic Four Unlimited #2}} He was apparently married, but the identity of his spouse is unknown at this time.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 6}}

===[[Forgotten Reign]]===
After [[Agon (Earth-616)|Agon]] and [[Rynda (Earth-616)|Rynda]] were killed in a tragic accident, a new wise [[Unspoken (Earth-616)|king]] started ruling [[Attilan]]. One day, when he and the two princes, [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]] and [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]], were contemplating a new monument the [[Alpha Primitives]] were building, they were attacked with neural inhibitors and the king was rendered unconscious. The princes began fighting to protect the King and, after Black Bolt's voice blacked every attacker out,{{r|Inhumans: Once and Future Kings #1}} Maximus killed [[Dkamas (Earth-616)|Dkamas]], the leader of the Uprising.{{r|Inhumans: Once and Future Kings #2}}

Later, the corrupt viceroy [[Kadlec (Earth-616)|Kadlec the Seeker]] led the king to suspect the young princes were conspiring to steal the throne, and [[Elisha (Alpha Primitive) (Earth-616)|Elisha]], one of the Alpha Primitives, convinced the two brothers that the king was plotting their demise, due to being humiliated when they saved his life. When Kadlec branded [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] as a traitor, she and the two brothers escaped with Elisha and [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]] to [[New York City]].{{r|Inhumans: Once and Future Kings #1}}

After this, the king dispatched Kadlec and [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]] to bring the teens back, but Karnak betrayed Kadlec and escaped to search for his missing brother [[Triton (Earth-616)|Triton]]. Meanwhile the king had already selected [[Gorgon Petragon (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] as his new viceroy and had given him the mission of understanding the real reason the teens had fled, since he was starting to distrust Kadlec.{{r|Inhumans: Once and Future Kings #2}}

===Coup D'Ã‰tat===
After the [[Forgotten Reign]], Black Bolt assumed the throne{{r|Mighty Avengers #27}} and a number of years prior to the Modern Age of Heroes, the Seeker became loyal to Maximus, who had vowed to oppose his brother and eventually usurp his rule.{{r|Inhumans Special #1}} Maximus staged his first successful coup a few years later by transforming three of the [[Alpha Primitives|Alpha Primitive]] working class into an energy being known as the [[Trikon (Earth-616)|Trikon]]. When the Trikon later began an Alpha Primitive uprising, the Inhuman Royal Family defended its people. While they were busy, Maximus and the Seeker took prisoner a number of prominent scientist, scholars, and other high ranking members of Inhuman society as hostages. When the crisis was averted, the Seeker and those loyal to Maximus kept these people hostage, forcing Black Bolt to relinquish the crown and the [[House of Agon (Earth-616)|Inhuman Royal Family]] to go into exile. Maximus was welcomed as the new leader and Black Bolt and his family reviled thanks to the bigoted opinions of the Inhumans toward the Alpha Primitive working class. In order to maintain plausible deniability and maintain social order, Maximus ordered the Seeker to kill all those involved in the Alpha Primitive uprising. During the convening months, Maximus installed a police state and the Seeker became one of his enforcers. When hostages attempted to break out, the Seeker reigned them back in, killing [[Korath (Inhuman) (Earth-616)|Korath]], member of the Royal Family and father to [[Gorgon Petragon (Earth-616)|Gorgon]]. When Gorgon later returned to Attilan seeking his family's freedom, Maximus agreed to let them free if he brought back the exiled members of the Royal Family, particularly [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] who had gone missing during the Alpha uprising. Not only was Gorgon unaware that the Seeker had killed his father, but when he was initially captured, the Seeker had implanted a tracking device in Gorgon's headdress so that he might track Gorgon outside of the refuge on behalf of Maximus later. {{r|Inhumans Special #1}}

===Hunter===
Three years later the exiled Inhuman Royal Family managed to trace Medusa to the city of New York. Amnesic, Medusa was under the protection of New York's premiere team of super-heroes known as the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]. During the ensuing battle, the Inhuman known as [[Triton (Earth-616)|Triton]] was forced to flee when the Fantastic Four's [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] compromised the suit that Triton needed to wear in order to breath on land. Diving into the waters below the battle, Triton was easily captured by the Seeker. Learning that the Fantastic Four housed the android known as [[Draconus (Earth-616)|Dragon Man]] in their [[Baxter Building]] headquarters, the Seeker broke into the base to take the creature, mistaking it for one of his fellow Inhumans. When the royal family later fled, the Fantastic Four learned that the Seeker had been in their headquarters and tracked down his ship. The Seeker took the group captive and explained to them the origins of the Inhumans before the Dragon Man awoke and managed to break free from captivity.{{r|Fantastic Four #46}}

While the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] battled the Dragon Man, the Seeker allowed Mister Fantastic and the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Girl]] save the life of Triton, whose aquatic tank was smashed during the Dragon Man's escape. After Dragon Man was contained the Seeker let the Fantastic Four go and returned to Attilan. There he learned that Black Bolt had retaken the Inhuman throne in his absence. However, Maximus was not to be undefeated as he revealed to the Seeker that he had created an Atmo-Gun that would destroy the human race once activated.{{r|Fantastic Four #47}} The Atmo-Gun was destroyed thanks to intervention from Black Bolt and his family and the Fantastic Four. With Maximus' plan foiled, the Seeker claimed that he was not involved and begged Black Bolt for forgiveness. However Maximus managed to get the final victory by forcing out the Fantastic Four and using a device to create a "Negative Zone" barrier around Attilan.{{r|Fantastic Four #48}}

===Death===
[[File:Kadlec_(Earth-616)_killed_by_Gorgon_in_Inhumans_Special_Vol_1_1.jpg|thumb|left|The Seeker dies battling Gorgon. {{r|Inhumans Special #1}}]]
Having learned that the Seeker had murdered his father, Gorgon came seeking him out to get revenge. When Gorgon confronted both Maximus and the Seeker, the Seeker was able to briefly incapacitate Gorgon thanks to the tracking device in his headdress. When Gorgon and Black Bolt caught up with the pair, Maximus used his mental powers to briefly control Black Bolt. When the Seeker attempted to shoot Gorgon, he grabbed Black Bolt and used him as a human shield. The blast was deflected through Black Bolt's tuning fork and into the mind of Maximus driving him even more insane than before. Attempting to flee, the Seeker was killed battling Gorgon, who caused a roof to collapse on his foe.{{r|Inhumans Special #1}} The Seeker is survived by his twin brother who took on the Seeker mantle,{{r|Fantastic Four Unlimited #2}} and presumably by his spouse.
