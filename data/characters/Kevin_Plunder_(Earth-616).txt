===Early Life===
Kevin Plunder was the eldest son of the British nobleman and scientist, [[Robert Plunder (Earth-616)|Lord Robert Plunder]]. He was born at [[Plunder Castle]], [[Kentish Town]], [[London (England)|London]] in the [[United Kingdom]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 13}} His father Lord Plunder, while searching for an undiscovered element he believed existed in nature, discovered the hidden jungle in [[Antarctica]] that became known as the [[Savage Land]]. There, he confirmed his theories by discovering the Anti-Metal (later determined to be an isotope of [[Vibranium]]), a substance that can destroy the molecular bonds of any known metal. Lord Plunder returned to his native [[England]] to find his wife had passed away in his absence. Realizing his own mortality, he locked away a sizable sample of the Anti-Metal he had brought back, and fashioned a small fragment of it into a medallion that could be used as a "key" to unleash its power. He then split the key in two, giving half to each of his two sons, Kevin and [[Parnival Plunder (Earth-616)|Parnival]], as their inheritance.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 13}}

===Becoming Ka-Zar===
When word of Lord Plunder's discovery leaked out, agents of an unscrupulous power tried to wrestle from him the Anti-Metal's location. Saved from the agents by the arrival of his armed butler Willis, Lord Plunder decided to see to his sons' safety. While Parnival was sent into hiding with Willis, he and Kevin sought refuge in the Savage Land. There Lord Plunder took his son to the mound of Anti-Metal, unaware they were being stalked by the native [[Maa-Gor (Earth-616)|Maa-Gor]] and his tribe of barbaric [[Homo neanderthalensis|Man-Apes]]. The Man-Apes slew Lord Plunder but, as they grabbed Kevin, they were attacked by [[Zabu (Earth-616)|Zabu]], the last of a species of saber-toothed tiger the Man-Apes had hunted to virtual extinction. Immediately forming an empathic bond, Zabu and the boy fled to the [[Land of Mists]], a region where the Man-Apes refused to set foot. The incident soon passed into the Man-Apes' legends, and the boy was given the name "Ka-Zar," which means "son of the tiger." In the Land of Mists, the boy grew to manhood, with his saber-toothed companion protecting him from all dangers. From Zabu, Ka-Zar learned the ways of the flora and fauna of the entire Savage Land. Upon reaching maturity, Ka-Zar failed in his attempts to make peace with the Man-Apes and was drawn into battle. At the battle's end, the whole tribe of Man-Apes had been killed with the exception of their leader Maa-Gor.{{r|X-Men #10}} 

===Protector of the Savage Land===
Ka-zar remained as the protector of the Savage Land. Ka-Zar encountered the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] who traveled to [[Antarctica]] to investigate the Savage Land believing Ka-Zar to be a [[mutant]]. They were attacked by the [[Swamp Men (Earth-616)|Swamp Men]] who easily got the drop on them, knocking most of their numbers out with swamp gas and kidnapped [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]]. Witnessing the battle, Ka-Zar went to the X-Men's rescue with the aid of his tiger [[Zabu]], where he agreed to help them free their friend from the Swamp Men. The Swamp People also captured [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] who was scouting the land from the air and brought back to their village.The Swamp People then brought them to the top of a hill where they were to be sacrificed to a deadly [[Dinosaurs|Tyrannosaurus Rex]]. The X-Men and Ka-Zar broke into the village, and Jean managed to compose herself to use her telekinetic powers to trip up the T-Rex and free herself and Angel. Now able to fly away, Warren grabbed Jean and the two of them joined their comrades in battle. Smashing through the defenses, Ka-Zar helped the X-Men dodge the Swamp Men's death traps and called a herd of Woolly Mammoths to smash through the wooden fence that surrounded the village. Ka-Zar and the X-Men made short work of the Swamp Men, sending them fleeing into the jungle in defeat.{{r|X-Men #10}}

He had since been an ally to many heroes, including [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 57|58}} [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]],{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 12|14}} and many others. He soon met his future wife, [[Shanna O'Hara (Earth-616)|Shanna the She-Devil]], when they were both captured by the red sorcerer [[Malgato (Earth-616)|Malgato]], who wanted to sacrifice them to the Sun Gods.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 #1|2}} Ka-Zar also became romantically involved with [[Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Barbara Morse]].{{r|Astonishing Tales Vol 1 19|20}}

Investigating a surge of madness caused by the Vibranium deposits that had befallen his friend [[Tongah (Earth-616)|Tongah]], Ka-Zar returned to London to find a scientist who could help cure the effects of the metal. He gave a press conference that was attacked by [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Klaw]]. During the attack, one of the journalists, [[Tandy Snow (Earth-616)|Tandy Snow]], was injured.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 #14}} After a battle with one of Klaw's creatures, he visited Snow in the hospital. She introduced him to [[Kirk Marston (Earth-616)|Kirk Marston]], a scientist who offered to accompany him to the Savage Land to inspect the Vibranium. There, they were confronted with an alien invasion by the [[Sheenarians]].{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 #15}} After defeating Klaw and the Sheenarian's initial invasion force, he traveled to their home dimension to prevent further incursions.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 #16}} There, he was captured by the [[Quarlians]] who had brainwashed Tandy and made her their queen. Tandy wanted Ka-Zar to become her king, and when he refused,{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 #17}} she sentenced him to death in the arena. Ka-Zar defeated his opponents and managed to escape along with fellow prisoner [[Zartros (Earth-616)|Zartros]], a Quarlian gnome.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 #18}} They were captured once more by Quarlian warrior Raknor, but managed to free themselves and escape with Tandy.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 #19}}

===Marriage and fatherhood===
Ka-Zar and Shanna began to gradually fall in love and eventually married. Soon after, while they were prisoners of the [[Nuwali]], Shanna found out that she was pregnant.{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage Vol 1 34}} Ka-Zar assisted the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] in their attempt to repel the space conqueror [[Jorro (Earth-616)|Terminus]], but while they rescued many natives, they were unable to prevent the destruction of the Savage Land. Ka-Zar was rescued by the Avengers, but left the Savage Land for the civilized world.{{r|Avengers #256|258}} Together, he and Shanna had a son named [[Matthew Plunder (Earth-616)|Matthew]]. Soon the Savage Land was reconstructed by the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] and Ka-Zar and Shanna returned with their newborn and resumed their previous roles.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 12}}

===Return of Parnival===
At one point, Ka-Zar and Shanna separated but soon got back together. Ka-Zar believed he had seen Parnival die only to learn years later that it was one of Parnival's flunkies,{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage Vol 1 33}} and that Parnival had survived, albeit with cybernetic prosthetics to combat his frostbite, and returned to [[New York City]] to begin building an empire which included purchasing large amounts of [[Manhattan]] real estate.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 4}} Parnival tricked Ka-Zar into believing he had learned more about their father's inheritance and lured his brother to New York by hiring [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter's]] teacher [[Gregor (Earth-616)|Gregor]] to torment and attack Ka-Zar and his family.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 1|3}} This would then lead Ka-Zar and [[Shanna O'Hara (Earth-616)|Shanna]] to seek him out in New York and confront him for his actions, leading Parnival to send the [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]] after them to keep them busy.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 4|6}} After dealing with the Rhino and convincing him to turn against Parnival, they were again attacked by Parnival's men to keep them busy and in New York to cover his theft of the terraformer technology from the [[Savage Land]].{{r|{{cl|Ka-Zar Vol 3 6}}-[[Ka-Zar ol 3 7|7]]}} While in New York Ka-Zar and Shanna would also meet [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]].{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 5}} who would then reveal that Parnival had lied about their being a further inheritance.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 8}}

===High Evolutionary===
During this time Ka-Zar had become more enamored with technology and the outside world which drove a wedge between him and Shanna for awhile. Ka-Zar would eventually figure out that his returned interests were because he was worried that he wasn't ready to become a father and was trying to return to his own childhood to recapture what he had missed.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 1|8}} When Ka-Zar and Shanna came to confront Parnival about his actions and to learn more about their medallion keys, Parnival had the terraformers activated and turned [[Manhattan]] into a jungle similar to the Savage Land.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 8}} While Ka-Zar went to take on Parnival and the man he was working for, [[Thanos (Low-Level Thanosi) (Earth-616)|"Thanos"]], Shanna worked to reverse the effects of the terraformer and learned that Thanos was trapped in a dimension within it where had been absorbing its power.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 9|10}} Ka-Zar baited and bluffed this empowered Thanos into chasing after him, to allow Shanna and [[Zabu (Earth-616)|Zabu]] to escape. This chase would eventually lead them through the terraformer which had been returned to the [[Savage Land]] by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 10}}

Thanos began to loose his new power now that he was no longer connected to the terraformer, Ka-Zar destroyed the medallion which featured a map of how to traverse its maze, so that Thanos couldn't return and empower himself again. Thanos entered the terraformer to try and regain his power and S.H.I.E.L.D. atomized it with him inside, returning the Savage Land to it's usual jungle paradise but also passing its power into Shanna.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 11}} The people of the Savage Land lost faith in Ka-Zar and Shanna took over as Queen with her new powers over the earth and animals, which left Ka-Zar feeling out of place and jealous. Ka-Zar worried what it would mean to have the power contained in a single person and how that would skew her perspectives, he also worried that if Shanna died then the Savage Land most likely would as well. The [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] had come to the [[Savage Land]] and Ka-Zar approached him to build a new terraformer.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 12}}

The High Evolutionary wasn't quite in his right mind though, affected by new isotopes he had created, and ended up fascinated by Shanna who he viewed as a goddess and pupil. The Evolutionary helped to expand upon Shanna's powers much to Ka-Zars chagrin and fear. Distance grew between them as Shanna neglected Ka-Zar and their son to her new responsibilities, only for Shanna to come to the realization that she was using her powers to pervert the natural order but be tempted by offers from the Evolutionary to create a new [[Counter-Earth (High Evolutionary)|Counter-Earth]]. Ka-Zar was similarly tempted to use [[Isotope E]] to evolve himself to Shanna's level{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 13}} but instead convinced the peoples of the Savage Land to aid him against the Evolutionary by telling them he was going to take Shanna from them. Leading a revolution of all the tribes of the Savage Land against the Evolutionary which resulted in him being injured. Seeing this convinced Shanna that her power had been affecting her mind and as she nursed Ka-Zar back to health she had her power removed and given over to a newly built terraformer.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 14}}

===New York City===
Shanna felt the loss of her power deeply, and while she went to find herself Ka-Zar returned to [[New York City]] to settle their debts with the [[Plaza Hotel]]. While travelling the subway a gun went off right next to his head and he was accidentally sprayed with mace, the combination temporarily deafened and blinded him and in the ensuing commotion when he attempted to disarm the gunmen, he mistakenly attacked a [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]] officer, resulting in a manhunt seeking his arrest.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 14}} Ka-Zar went to [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]] for help but he was out of town, his partner [[Franklin Nelson (Earth-616)|Foggy Nelson]] agreed to help him sort out his problems with the authorities and let him stay at [[Matt Murdock's Apartment]].{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 15}}

An amnesiac [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] had heard about Ka-Zar's alleged crimes and witnessed what seemed to be him escaping police with a hostage and began targeting him. After a long battle across rooftops and through the streets, Ka-Zar told the Punisher he wasn't responsible for what the police were blaming him for and the Punisher believed him and let him go.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 15|16}} [[Everett Ross (Earth-616)|Everett Ross]] cleared Ka-Zar's name but Ka-Zar then tried to apprehend one of the men involved in the shooting, who was planning on catching him believing there to be reward money, and the police again assumed Ka-Zar was the aggressor, leading him to once again have to escape them. Ka-Zar made his way to [[Avengers Mansion]] where the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] told him Shanna had sent a message calling him home and offered his help. When they went to retrieve Zabu they were met with the subway shooter once again who the Black Panther helped him deal with before giving him a prototype jet so he could return with Zabu to the Savage Land.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 17}}

===Return to the Savage Land===
Ka-Zar found the Savage Land in turmoil, the land behaving unnaturally and the people having turned against him and Shanna whom they blamed and who he was quickly reunited with. They then split up with Ka-Zar going after [[Gregor (Earth-616)|Gregor]] who had returned and fought with Shanna, while Shanna sought out who or what was behind the turmoil in the Savage Land. Ka-Zar and Gregor fought with Gregor getting the upper hand and almost drowning Ka-Zar until a taunt about his family drove Ka-Zar mad with bloodlust, leading him to savagely beat Gregor. The [[Bhadwuans (Earth-616)|Bhadwuans]] believed Ka-Zar to be the problem and Shanna and the rest of the Savage Land united against them to stop them from killing him but Ka-Zar and his family agreed to leave the Savage Land alongside their nanny [[Zira (Earth-616)|Zira]] and leave Zabu behind.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 18|20}}

===Further Adventures===
Some time later when [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] traveled to the Savage Land he encountered fast aging clones of the Plunder family and then rescued the originals who had at some point returned to living in the Savage Land.{{r|Captain America Vol 3 28|31}}

At the office of [[Nelson and Murdock Law Office|Nelson and Murdock]], [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]] introduced Ka-Zar to [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]], who he wanted to hire Jessica to find [[Zabu (Earth-616)|Zabu]], who had gone missing. However, Jessica declined.{{r|Alias Vol 1 24}}

[[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] would later subdue [[Zabu (Earth-616)|Zabu]] as part of a reality television show, causing Ka-Zar and Shanna to follow after him and found Zabu, whom Hercules had hog-tied after defeating him.{{r|Hercules Vol 3 3}} They then had him returned to them after a party celebrating the success of Hercules' TV show, which they traveled to [[New York City]] for.{{r|Hercules Vol 3 5}}

Ka-Zar would then come under the control of the [[Savage Land Mutates (Earth-616)|Savage Land Mutate]] [[Lani Ubanu (Earth-616)|Lorelei]] who was working alongside other Mutates to disrupt electrical signals across the world to try and expand the Savage Land's prehistoric dominion while Shanna was held captive by them. He was freed by [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] who had come to retrieve the machine the Mutates intended to use and who helped to defeat the Mutates.{{r|Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 49}}

Ka-Zar and Shanna would then later fight villains hired by [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]] to steal vibranium, and other precious resources, from the Savage Land. When these villains failed, Roxxon hired Ka-Zar's brother to try and kill him for them.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 2 5|7}}

===Secret Invasion===
[[File:Savage Land from New Avengers Vol 1 41 001.jpg|right|thumb]]
During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]], Ka-Zar and Shanna brought together the many tribes of the Savage Land to fight the [[Savage Land Skrulls (Earth-616)|Skrulls]], such as the [[Tree People]], [[Swamp Men]], [[Zebra People]], [[Sun-People]], [[Pterons]], and the [[Man-Apes]]. They had been aware of the presence of [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] for some time, after Skrulls posing as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, led by a Skrull posing as [[Timothy Dugan (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Contessa Valentina]], took over the Vibranium mines, enslaving the natives of the Savage Land to run the mining operation for them. Together Ka-Zar and Shanna gathered their army of Savage Land natives as they could not trust anyone from the outside that they might call for help.{{r|New Avengers #41}} They questioned the Skrull [[Pitt'o Nili (Earth-616)|Pitt'o Nili]], who had believed himself to be Captain America, and also confirmed that a [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] they had come across was not a Skrull, using poisoned blow darts that had revealed Pitt'o Nili, Shanna then killed him when his only response to their questions was "I am a human."{{r|New Avengers #43}}{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 5|7}}

===Empyre===
During an adventure in the Savage Land, Shanna was killed but then returned to life in a process that connected her to the life-force of the Savage Land.{{r|Savage Wolverine Vol 1 4}} Shanna's newfound powers put a dent in her relationship with Ka-Zar, who was scared of the way Shanna had changed due to her connection to their homeland. This complication facilitated Ka-Zar's decision to abandon the Savage Land when he was recruited into the [[Agents of Wakanda (Earth-616)|Agents of Wakanda]],{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 2}} a support staff for the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] assembled by [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 12}}

During an invasion on Earth by the plant-based alien race known as the [[Cotati]], Ka-Zar joined a group of heroes tasked with intercepting a Cotati incursion on the Savage Land. When the heroes arrived, among the Cotati's forces was Shanna,{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 1}} whose connection to the Savage Land had been exploited by the Cotati to bend her will. With the help of the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], Ka-Zar tapped into Shanna's mindscape and freed her from the Cotati control, reconciling with her in the process. Ka-Zar was afterward impaled by a Cotati soldier,{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 2}} but Shanna managed to save his life by submerging his body in the same waters that had imbued her with the spirit of the Savage Land, granting him the same connection to their homeland.{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 3}}

| Powers                  = '''Savage Land Connection:''' After being saved from near-death by being submerged in waters imbued with blood from the Savage Land's [[Man-Thing (Savage Land) (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]], Ka-Zar became connected to the essence of the Savage Land, a link shared by Shanna the She-Devil.{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 3}} In Shanna's case, this link enhanced her physiology to superhuman levels, and also granted her instinctive knowledge of the languages and history of the Savage Land and its people.{{r|Savage Wolverine Vol 1 4}} Kevin showed he can manipulate the odd faunal aspects of the Savage Land within himself; being able to mimic the aspects of different animals and physically augment himself enough to catapult a 8-9ton T-Rex over 50miles with his bare hands.{{r|Ka-Zar: Lord of the Savage Land Vol 1 1}}

| Abilities               = '''Near-Superhuman Condition:''' Although Ka-Zar once claimed he was endowed with superhuman strength by the vapors in the Land of Mists, this is not true. Ka-Zar possesses no superhuman physical powers, but his near-superhuman athletic, hunting, foraging, and combative abilities have been honed to superb athletic conditioning, due to spending two-thirds of his life surviving in the wilds of the Savage Land.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 6}} He has been stated to be a superior fighter to [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]] by the man who trained Kraven.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 2}}
*'''Near-Superhuman Strength:'''{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 6}}
*'''Near-Superhuman Endurance:'''{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 6}}
*'''Master Tactician & Strategist:''' Ka-Zar has been stated to be highly skilled at tactics, and with his in-depth knowledge of the Savage Land, is virtually unbeatable in his own terrain.
*'''Multilingual:''' Ka-Zar was able to understand and communicate with the various tribes of the Savage Land.{{r|New Avengers #41}}{{r|New Avengers #43}}

| Strength                = Ka-Zar has nearly super-human strength. While the exact amount of weight he can ultimately lift has not been measured, Ka-Zar is strong enough to lift (press) at least 430 lbs, which is twice his own body weight.{{Citation}} He can lift up to 2-5 tons when pressed.{{Citation}}
| Weaknesses              = 

| Equipment               = [[Vibranium]] Belt Buckle of unknown variation.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 14}}
<br>Living Fatigues: Shanna provided him with adaptable biowear that enables itself to adapt to environmental & climate alterations to protect it's wearer while trekking through hostile territory.{{r|Ka-Zar: Lord of the Savage Land Vol 1 1}}
| Transportation          = Naturally occurring vines which he swings upon.
| Weapons                 = While Ka-Zar has a general familiarity with a wide variety of basic weapons, the only one he uses regularly is the large knife he made from native materials. He generally straps the knife to his waist when not in use. He sometimes uses a slingshot, and has at times wielded a bow and arrow.

| Notes                   = * Kevin Plunder is not to be confused with the Golden Age hero of the same name, [[Ka-Zar (David Rand)|Ka-Zar]], whose real name was '''David Rand'''.
| Trivia                  = * In his first few appearances, Ka-Zar spoke in broken English, similar to common portrayals of [[Tarzan Comic Books|Tarzan]]. Starting with {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 57}}, he had apparently spent enough time living in Great Britain to learn grammatically correct English.
