===Early Life===
Amadeus Cho was a Korean-American born and raised in  [[Tucson]], [[Arizona (State)|Arizona]]. Above average was insufficient to define this extraordinary teen. His parents [[Helen Cho (Earth-616)|Helen]] and [[Philip Cho (Earth-616)|Phil]] emigrated from [[South Korea]] before he was born. They had quite a passion for historical names, something they showed the moment they had to name their two children. Their son was named after the composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Earth-616)|Mozart]], and a daughter, [[Madame Curie Cho (Earth-616)|Madame Curie Cho]], called Maddy for short. The Cho's lived a normal and happy life, but Amadeus showed from his very childhood that he was different: he was incredibly smart for such a young boy, and learned a lot of things by himself, becoming highly cultured and increasing his already remarkable intelligence. Helen supported her genius son and tried to go along with his talent.{{r|Incredible Hercules Vol 1 133}} The more Amadeus grew up, the more his parents realized he was a genius.

When the boy was fifteen years old, the [[Excello]], a soap corporation, announced an online game to reward young geniuses, a quiz show named Brain Fight. Amadeus participated, and he easily won the $5,000 reward, placing first. Helen and Philip, of course, were happy for their son’s results, but they didn't know this was just the beginning of the end for their family. The person who had organized Brain Fight, in fact, was another genius and former child prodigy, [[Pythagoras Dupree (Earth-616)|Pythagoras Dupree]], whose real aim was to search the world for other people whose intellect might rival his own…and to eliminate them as unwanted rivals. By winning his game, Amadeus Cho had been awarded the title of Mastermind Excello and the position of “7th Smartest Man in the World” (Pythagoras, by his own claim, was the 6th), and that was more than enough a reason to be killed. Dupree had his men attack Amadeus’ house, and in the following explosion, Helen, and her husband got killed. Amadeus ran away with his only companion being a coyote pup [[Kerberos (Earth-616)|Kirby]].{{r|Incredible Hercules Vol 1 137}}

[[File:Incredible Hulk Vol 1 106 page 02 Amadeus Cho (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|left]]
===The Hulk===
Agents tracked him down but not before Amadeus ran into to another misunderstood genius with awesome power: the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]. The Hulk protected Mastermind, who then considered him his friend.{{r|Amazing Fantasy Vol 2 15}}

Some time later, a terrible accident involving super-heroes in [[Stamford]], [[Connecticut (State)|Connecticut]] killed 612 including the school children. The "Stamford Incident" gave rise to the [[Superhuman Registration Act]].{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report #1}} [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] went to apprehend the unregistered Mastermind Excello. After outsmarting some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Amadeus discovered a hide-out in [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]] that once belonged to his friend the Hulk. There Amadeus hacked into the [[Baxter Building]] security network and discovered that a group of heroes called the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]], including [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]] of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avenger]] [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], had sent the Hulk into exile in outer space.{{r|World War Hulk Prologue: World Breaker #1}} Using a special phone line, he informed Reed Richards about his discovery. A satellite revealed that the Hulk wasn't where the Illuminati thought they had sent their former friend. Amadeus left Reed thinking about his betrayal of his former ally and friend while Amadeus set off to find the Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 106}} 

The Hulk soon returned to earth with his [[Warbound (Earth-616)|Warbound]] looking for revenge. Cho restored [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]]'s powers after finding her de-powered by Tony Stark's [[Super-Power Inhibiting Nanobots|S.P.I.N.]] tech.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 2 18}} Cho tried to recruit her to his cause. She-Hulk declined, choosing instead to get revenge on Stark using the legal system, but put him in contact with [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] who owed the Hulk due to an altercation from when they were part of the [[Champions of Los Angeles (Earth-616)|Champions]].{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 107}} Cho used Angel’s money to buy a submarine. The trio went off to recruit [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]]. Wanting no part of the Illuminati’s plot to begin with, Namor dismissed Cho's idea. [[Aquaria Neptunia (Earth-616)|Namora]] decided to join the three in her cousin's place.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 108}}

[[File:Incredible Hercules Vol 1 133 Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]
Cho’s group offered their help to Hulk, but he dismissed them but was forced to accept help due to [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|General Ross]]'s attack. S.H.I.E.L.D. eventually recruited Cho’s team to protect the non-evacuated civilians. Cho eventually met [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] but didn't see eye-to-eye with him. Cho’s group met up with [[Carmilla Black (Earth-616)|Scorpion]] to find and free the heroes captured by the Warbound.{{r|World War Hulk #2}}{{r|Hulk Family: Green Genes #1}}{{r|Planet Skaar Prologue #1}} Seeing the way the heroes were being treated caused Cho to confront the Hulk alone. Cho attempted to show Hulk that he wished to create a safe haven for him but he was attacked, causing Hercules and his crew to come to Cho’s aid. The Hulk left after Cho argued that his anger was what killed his loved ones and that Banner was what kept them loving him. When [[Zom (Earth-616)|Zom]] possessed Stark’s Hulkbuster armor, Cho and his crew captured the demon with [[Wong (Earth-616)|Wong]]'s help. When Hulk was defeated, Cho and Hercules became prisoners of S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 109}}{{r|World War Hulk: Aftersmash #1}}

===Hercules===
During his imprisonment, S.H.I.E.L.D. decided that Cho’s intelligence was going to be beneficial in moving the evacuated New Yorkers back to their homes. He declined, believing that if he did they would eventually make him a tool their militaristic plans. [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] also didn't like S.H.I.E.L.D.'s plans for him rescued Cho and escaped. With [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]] on their trail, his coyote dying, and Hercules hallucinating, Cho became fed up with all that S.H.I.E.L.D. had done. He used Hercules' crazed state to take over a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel and upload a virus that would destroy all S.H.I.E.L.D. tech.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 110}} When Hercules regained his sound state of mind he convinced Cho that he was in danger of being labeled as a villain for the rest of his life. Cho restored all the S.H.I.E.L.D. tech and continued on with Hercules.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 111}}

Upon meeting up with [[Athena Parthenos (Earth-616)|Athena]] the trio set out to [[San Francisco]] to assemble a team of gods from Earth ([[Narya (Earth-616)|Snowbird]], [[Ajak (Earth-616)|Tecumotzin]], [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (Earth-616)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]], and [[Atum (Earth-616)|Atum the God Eater]]) to battle and defeat the Skrull Gods [[Kly'bn (Earth-616)|Kly'Bn]] and [[Sl'gur't (Earth-616)|Sl'gur't]].{{r|Incredible Hercules #119}} In route to Skrull space through the [[Dream Realm]], they battled [[Nightmare (Earth-616)|Nightmare]] and received his map of the dream realm.{{r|Incredible Hercules #120}}

===Delphyne===
Cho and Hercules battle [[Amazons (Earth-616)|Amazons]], led by [[Artume (Earth-616)|Princess Artume]], who need him to decipher an [[Atlantean]] tablet that will lead to the [[Omphalos]].{{r|Incredible Hercules #121}} Cho became attracted to the Amazon [[Delphyne Gorgon (Earth-616)|Delphyne Gorgon]].{{r|Incredible Hercules #122}} The attraction was mutual.{{r|Incredible Hercules #123}} The two began a relationship.{{r|Incredible Hercules #124}} but upon becoming queen she ended the relationship.{{r|Incredible Hercules #125|126}}

===Underworld===
Cho, Hercules and Athena confront [[Hera (Earth-616)|Hera]] the newly appointed leader of the [[Olympians]] and travel to the [[Underworld]] to rescue [[Zeus (Earth-616)|Zeus]].{{r|Incredible Hercules #127|128}} While Hercules battled hordes of vengeful enemies in [[Tartarus (Place)|Tartarus]],{{r|Incredible Hercules #129|130}} Amadeus ended up in the [[Elysian Fields]] (the Greek version of Heaven), where he met his parents again. Before he could finish apologizing for having "caused" their death by winning Brain Fight, Helen and Philip interrupted him and hugged him, happy and proud of what their son had become. Before he could come back to Earth, however, Helen told Amadeus something he didn't know yet: Maddy didn't die in the explosion, and was still alive, taken by the Excello and kept somewhere, needing his help. She would have watched over her children from the Elysian Fields, but she couldn't have done much else: it was up to Amadeus to make things right and to reunite what remained of their family.{{r|Incredible Hercules Vol 1 131}}

===The Mighty Avengers===
In the aftermath of Secret Invasion, the activities of the [[Elder Gods of Earth|Elder God]] [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]] created a series of freak events that Cho dubbed the "Chaos Cascade", and concluded the Avengers would be necessary to deal with the events.{{r|Mighty Avengers #21}} Hercules and Cho located [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Edwin Jarvis]], and then [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]] and [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]].{{r|Mighty Avengers #22}} [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] in the guise of Wanda Maximoff, arrived in an astral form to greet them and supply the gathered forces with an "army" to form the new [[Mighty Avengers (Pym) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]] (later aided by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]), which Hercules chose to remain with.{{r|Mighty Avengers #23}} Loki covertly used them to form and widen cracks in Osborn's armor, and which [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] sought to crush.{{r|Mighty Avengers #24}} Chthon was banished through their combined efforts with [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Pietro Maximoff]], with Hercules explaining to the others that the death of the Demogorge with the Skrullian gods was the factor Chthon used to attack the universe.{{r|Mighty Avengers #25|33}}

===Mastermind Excello===
In the town of [[Excello]], [[Utah (State)|Utah]] Cho met with FBI [[Agent Sexton]], who had contacted him just after the death of his parents, and does battle with Pythagoras Dupree, who claimed to be the sixth-smartest man in the world.{{r|Incredible Hercules #133}} He realized his brain could serve as a "Hypercomputer", and figured out that Agent Sexton was really Athena in disguise.{{r|Incredible Hercules #135|140}}	

===Fall of the Hulks===
Cho found himself in the crossfire when [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Red She-Hulk]] attacked the Mighty Avengers in an attempt to capture [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #607}}  While considered a possible target for the [[Intelligencia (Earth-616)|Intelligencia]]'s hunt for the eight greatest minds of in the world, Bruce Banner confirmed Cho's drop to tenth.{{r|Incredible Hulk #608}} However, Banner would retract his statement, claiming Cho was always one of the eight.{{r|Incredible Hulk #610}} Cho helped Banner disable [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]]'s armor, saving Pym's life, only to have the super-scientist stolen from under their noses. Later Cho joined Banner and a select team of superheroes in an assault on the Intelligencia's secret headquarters in an attempt to save Betty Ross.{{r|Incredible Hulk #611}}

After Hercules fell in battle, Cho had to fight to prevent the takeover of the Olympian pantheon by the most terrifying god on the planet. With Banner, Skaar, Thor, and Namor swept into the conflict.{{r|Hercules: Fall of an Avenger #2}}{{r|Mighty Avengers #36}}{{r|Thunderbolts #143}}

===Prince of Power===
Cho discovered that the [[Olympus Group (Earth-616)|Olympus Group]]'s Continuum plan is to overwrite all of reality with an artificial one the gods have created in a pocket universe. Cho and [[Athena Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Athena]] reunited with Hercules to prevent it from happening, and he called upon the Avengers to help him storm [[Olympus]].{{r|Heroic Age: Prince of Power #1}} During the battle, Cho found himself battling against [[Delphyne Gorgon (Earth-616)|Delphyne]], working for the Olympus Group. She sought revenge on Athena for the gorgon curse.{{r|Heroic Age: Prince of Power #2}} Hercules and Cho try to stop Continuum but when Cho found Hercules again he appeared to be dead.{{r|Heroic Age: Prince of Power #3}} Athena claimed that Hercules died to stop Continuum from spilling out into reality. However, it was revealed that she betrayed Hercules in order for Amadeus to become the new "Prince of Power."{{r|Heroic Age: Prince of Power #4}}

===Chaos War===

Amadeus Cho met Bruce Banner in the middle of Lake Michigan. They then teleport to [[Milwaukee]], where a trio of [[Centaurs]] have gone amok. After a battle, they send the Centaurs back to Cho then hits them with a stun beam, from an orbiting satellite. Cho then turned to the Hulk and asked him what he needs help with. The Hulk asked if he could help with the Hulk family.{{r|Incredible Hulks #617}}

The young heroes were not happy that he had manipulated them, and they turned his offer down.{{r|Fear Itself: The Home Front #7}}

===Savage Land===
[[File:Amadeus Cho (Earth-616) Savage Wolverine Vol 1 4.jpg|thumb|left|180px]]
Amadeus made himself a [[Calvin Klein A.I. Suit|suit]], affording him abilities like enhanced durability and strength, limited flight and universal translation, with an A.I. named Calvin. He found himself stuck on a mysterious island in the [[Savage Land]] thanks to a damping field. Using his powers, Amadeus was able to convince the natives that he was a god.{{r|Savage Wolverine #2}} Their chief explained to him that there was a machine on the island that imprisoned a hostile alien creature and that they were sworn to protect it. This machine generated the damping field that kept Amadeus on the island.

After learning from the natives that [[Shanna O'Hara (Earth-616)|Shanna]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] were on the island, Amadeus set out to stop them before they could destroy the machine. Unfortunately, Shanna was killed in a fight with the natives and Wolverine set off in a rage to destroy the machine.{{r|Savage Wolverine #3}} Cho urged the natives to help Shanna, and they used the [[Man-Thing (Savage Land) (Earth-616)|Man-Thing of the Savage Land]] to resurrect her.{{r|Savage Wolverine #4}}

Amadeus explained to her the situation with the machine and they set off to stop Wolverine from destroying it. Shanna arrived first and was able to save the machine. Cho arrived after her, as Shanna's physical capabilities had been enhanced by the resurrection. To the surprise of them all, the Hulk suddenly appeared.{{r|Savage Wolverine #4}}

When Hulk wondered where Amadeus Cho was and told him that he is in the Savage Land and told Hulk and Wolverine to stand down. Just as he did they are attacked by giant gorillas. During the fight with the giant gorillas, the dampening field is accidentally damaged during the fight which freed the alien [[Morrigon (Earth-616)|Morrigon]] (who was the "Dark Walker") who fled from Earth. Morrigon returned to his master [[Visher-Rakk (Earth-616)|Visher-Rakk]], an alien with the same planet-eating motive as [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]]. Morrigon told Visher-Rakk of a galaxy filled with planets for him to feed on.{{r|Savage Wolverine #5}}

===Time Runs Out===
[[File:Amadeus Cho (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 5 35 0001.png|thumb|right]]
Amadeus joined the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] and went into hiding with them due to the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] being on the hunt for them. He broke into the Avengers Tower, now the S.H.I.E.L.D. Station: Golgotha to retrieve Tony Stark's files. However he was found, and a disrupting field was projected so he couldn't teleport using a translocator. He was forced to break out of the tower, but he was soon chased by the Avengers, who managed to corner and let the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]] trap him. She then interrogated him about the current location of the Illuminati.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}}

===Totally Awesome Hulk===
Some time after the problem the Illuminati were tackling, the [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]], were no more, Amadeus assisted the Hulk when he got stuck with a dangerous amount of a new type of radiation that could've caused him to melt down and kill countless innocent people.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk #2}} Using special nanites, Amadeus absorbed the Hulk's powers, becoming a gamma-powered monster and the new Hulk.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk #4}} Amadeus attempted to distance himself from Banner,{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk #1}} in the sense that he tried to maintain control over his Hulk persona, and prided himself of being a better and smarter Hulk.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk #23}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #709}} During his tenure as the Hulk, Amadeus joined forces with many heroes, and even became part of the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]].{{r|Champions Vol 2 1}}

[[File:Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 1 Cho Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Amadeus as the Hulk]]
However, very early into his adventures, Amadeus showed difficulty in keeping his range under control when pushing his strength to incalculable levels to save the day.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk #3}} In addition to this, Amadeus' condition as the Hulk forced him to repress his emotions to control his powers.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk #5}} Amadeus' self-control was particularly put to the test following Banner's death at the hands of [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] during the [[Civil War II|second superhuman civil war]].{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk #9}} After travelling to his own subconscious and failing to subdue his Hulk persona,{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk #22}} Amadeus exiled himself to a satellite in deep space in hopes of studying himself and find a way to contain the Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk #709}}

Amadeus' self-quarantine was interrupted by a distress call from the planet [[Sakaar]], which had once been freed by his predecessor. The many nomadic tribes of Sakaar were either absorbed or threatened by the forces of the [[Warlord (Sakaar) (Earth-616)|Warlord of Fillia]]. Hulk was called by the [[Doka'abi Clan (Earth-616)|Doka'abi Clan]] to represent them in a series of trials for survival. Amadeus became their champion and eventually defeated the Warlord himself. Despite his best efforts, Amadeus eventually gave in to the Hulk's rage, allowing his Hulk persona to take control of his body while Amadeus' normal self became a prisoner of his own mind.{{r|Incredible Hulk #709|713}} Once he returned to Earth, Hulk made quick show of his new ruthless behavior, declaring war on his enemies.{{r|Incredible Hulk #714}} The Hulk even turned against his allies when they tried to talk sense into him.{{r|Incredible Hulk #715}} Amadeus' Hulk personality was finally subdued when his allies injected him with an array of nanobots to break down those that allowed Amadeus' body to retain gamma energy, which gave Amadeus' psyche a chance to fight back against his other self. However, Amadeus realized he couldn't just destroy the darker side of his personality, and decided to embrace it. With his mind having become whole again, Amadeus retained a portion of his Hulk powers permanently.{{r|Incredible Hulk #717}}

| Powers                  = *'''Hulk Physiology:''' Using an array of [[Sternbot|nanobots]] derived from technology created by the [[Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)|Leader]], Amadeus Cho altered the structure of his cells to allow them to contain and use gamma energy.{{r|Incredible Hulk #717}} Initially, Amadeus possessed powers similar to his predecessor, [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]].{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk #1}} When his Hulk personality took over, Amadeus was injected with another type of nanobots that were supposed to break down the Sternbots. These counter-bots were concentrated in Amadeus' brain, and were intended to cause him to lose a portion of his powers; however, they were also designed to allow Amadeus to direct them, so he instead used them to merge with the Hulk persona and assume a smaller and slimmer form.{{r|Incredible Hulk #717}}
