===Early Life===
Mowfus was an extraterrestrial from the planet [[Quon]]. His species were amphibious and preferred to spend most of their time submerged in water. His ship crashed landed on [[Earth]] and was forced to make his home in the [[Florida (State)|Florida Everglades]]. He and his mate [[Bisq (Earth-616)|Bisq]] and unborn offspring hid in a cave known as the "Lost Lagoon", to keep away from the natives.{{r|Fantastic Four #97}}

===Monster from the Lost Lagoon===
[[File:Mowfus (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Vol 1 97 0001.png|left|thumb|Monster from the Lost Lagoon]]
He came into contact with the superhero team the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] who were on vacation in Florida. [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] took the opportunity to search for the so-called "Lost Lagoon". During their investigation they spotted Mowfus in the water, but when they tried to get a closer look he managed to get away. Mowfus observed the humans as they relaxed on the beach. Mowfus worried he would be discovered so he took a serum that transformed him into a human.

Arriving at a nearby oceanarium, he was mistaken for one of the employees and was asked to put on a performance with the dolphins. As he complied he was observed by the Fantastic Four. Impressed by his skills in water, Reed then asked the strange man to lead them on a mission to find the Lost Lagoon. The man agreed, and when they get close he shocked them when he suddenly smashed through the bulkhead of their submarine, flooding it with water. The Fantastic Four followed after Mowfus in the water and were lead to an air-filled cavern. There they find Mowfus has reverted by to his natural form. A fight briefly broke out, but Reed called it to a stop when he noticed that the creature posed no threat to them at all. They soon discovered that it was trying to repair it's ship so the creature, it's mate, and their unborn offspring could return to the stars. Allowing Mowfus to depart, the trio watched from the surface as the alien ship blasted out of the water and into the sky.{{r|Fantastic Four #97}}

===Seeking a Cure===
Mowfus was forced to return to Earth to get medicine when his mate Bisq contracted an illness from their last visit. Desperate for aid, it kidnapped [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Sue Storm]] for help. This lead to another battle with the Fantastic Four. {{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 124}} Eventually they learned the truth about Mowfus and his desperate actions and once again offered to help the family. With Bisq cured the family returned to the stars.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 125}}

===Power Pack===
Mowfus was forced to leave behind their unborn children in the Lost Lagoon. But the eggs were discovered by a group of deep sea explorers. Mowfus attacked their ship, and was able to get  a couple of the eggs back into the water. The crew was saved by [[Power Pack (Earth-616)|Power Pack]], who were on vacation in [[Florida (State)|Florida]]. Bisq took human form and tried to recover one of the eggs from a museum, but failed. The crew returned to find more and Bisq attacked. She was knocked out by the captain and Mowfus came to the rescue. [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]] learned the identity of the creatures from his father and convinced him to stop. Power Pack used their powers to heal his Bisq as the eggs began to hatch naming them [[Bruuk (Earth-616)|Bruuk]], [[Koln (Earth-616)|Koln]] and [[Xak (Earth-616)|Xak]]. Mowfus and his family departed the planet yet again.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes Vol 2 6}}
