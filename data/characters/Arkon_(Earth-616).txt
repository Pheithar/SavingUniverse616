===Origin===
Arkon was born of noble lineage on the extradimensional world [[Polemachus]]. The people of Polemachus developed a culture that glorifies warfare, and Arkon succeeded in becoming the greatest warrior of his people. Appointed Imperion of the largest country on Polemachus, Arkon mounted military campaigns against neighboring countries in an effort to conquer the world. His dreams were forgotten when Polemachus was faced with a world-wide catastrophe in that the light and heat providing planetary rings were disintegrating. Arkon's scientists, led by [[Grand Vizier (Polemachus) (Earth-616)|Grand Vizier Graybeard]], determined that atomic explosions occurring on Earth somehow were extradimensionally translated to rekindle the energy rings for about a year. Although Polemachus had not developed nuclear weaponry, the scientists predicted that if they were to atomically annihilate the Earth, their world's energy-rings would be restored to power.{{r|Avengers #75}}

===The Avengers===
Toward this goal, Arkon manipulated the hero known as the Scarlet Witch into reciting a magical spell found in a Polemachian book to enable Arkon to transport himself to Earth. Attracted to the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], Arkon kidnapped her (to force her become his queen) as well as a group of atomic scientists.{{r|Avengers #75}} The scientists used to construct an atomic device. Before Arkon could detonate it on Earth, however, Scarlet Witch's super team, the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], reached Polemachus, defeated Arkon's army and forced him to retreat to New York City, where he was followed by some of the Avengers. While Arkon fought those enemies at the [[Empire State Building]], Avengers [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor Odinson]] and [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], still at Polemachus, managed to artificially rekindle Polemachus' energy-rings without damaging Earth. Arkon received a report on this by his Vizier, and then he ceased hostilities with Earth, even refusing to keep the Scarlet Witch as his bride.{{r|Avengers #76}}

The Avengers had cause to revisit Arkon's world when their comrade, the [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]], was taken captive by Arkon while searching for the Well at the Center of Time. Arkon ceased hostilities with the Avengers when he learned that he was being duped by the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] [[Amora (Earth-616)|Enchantress]].

===Nuclear Conflagration===
Although his world now possessed the capacity for atomic power, Arkon was dissatisfied with the length of time it took to build a nuclear arsenal. Thus, he devised a plan to pit three extra-dimensional worlds, one of which was Earth, against one another, in hopes that the energy from the resultant nuclear conflagration could be absorbed by his world. His elaborate machinations failed, due to the efforts of the super-team [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]{{r|Fantastic Four #160|163}}.

===Storm===
Arkon was forced to return to [[Earth]] yet again when the machine that [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] had once built to rekindle Polemachus' rings failed due to Arkon's tinkering with it. Arkon traveled to Earth to recruit Thor to recharge the machine, but he settled for the mutant known as [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], who also had the ability to summon lightning. Storm agreed to help and Arkon returned Storm and her allies to Earth. Another time, the Fantastic Four helped Arkon drive off an extra-dimensional invasion of Polemachus by the alien race of [[Badoon]].{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 5}}

===Thundra===
[[File:Karia (Earth-616), Thundra (Earth-715) and Arkon (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 365 001.jpg|180px|thumb|right|With Thundra]]
Some time later, Arkon traveled to Earth to employ the Avengers and Fantastic Four as pawns in his war with rival otherworldly monarch [[Thundra (Earth-715)|Thundra]], until he made peace with Thundra after realizing they shared a strong mutual attraction.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #75}} Later, with consort Thundra, Arkon sought the Avengers' aid in repairing Polemachus's energy ring and protecting the maiden Astra from becoming a human sacrifice to Polemachus' religious zealots led by the high priest Anskar.{{r|Avengers #358|359}}

Arkon also had a rival in his Grand Vizier, who, over time, convinced Arkon to return Polemachus to a more barbaric lifestyle rather than rely on its science. The Grand Vizier then abducted the superhero and Avenger [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Photon]] along with the supervillains battling her at the time, the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]]. The Grand Vizier used the Wrecking Crew to depose Arkon and Thundra, until the Avengers arrived to rescue their teammate and restore Arkon to the throne. Polemachus then returned to its hybrid barbaric/scientific lifestyle.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 #16|18}}

===Battleworld===
Arkon found himself on the [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]] domain of [[Weirdworld (Battleworld)|Weirdworld]].{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 4 #4}}

===All-New, All-Different===
Arkon kept searching for Polemachus and came across the survivors of the airplane that crash landed onto Weirdworld upon going through the Bermuda Triangle. He saved them and told them that they needed to get away from the plane wreck.{{r|Weirdworld Vol 2 #1}}

When Arkon was sighted on Earth, Thundra and [[Tyndall (Weirdworld)|Tyndall]] arrived to look for help in finding him. Their search for Arkon was interrupted by the arrival of [[Warbow (Crystalium) (Earth-616)|Warbow]] and his Crystal Warriors, the [[Magma Men]], and the [[Elves (Weirdworld)|Elves of Klarn]] as Thundra told Tyndall to find the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-616)|Squadron Supreme]]. When the Squadron, Tyndall, and Thundra ended up on Weirdworld, they were ambushed by Arkon who had been possessed by an evil madness as he assisted [[Modred (Earth-616)|Modred]] and [[Zarda Shelton (Earth-21195)|Warrior Woman]] in taking down [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-31916)|Nighthawk]], [[Jeffrey Walters (Earth-148611)|Blur]], and Tyndall. When the three of them brought Nighthawk, Blur, and Tyndall to a specific castle, they found it inhabited by a revived [[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Doctor Druid]].{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 4 #1|4}}

'''Superhuman Durability:''' Arkon's bodily tissues is five times denser than the bodily tissue of a human being, contributing to his superhuman strength and weight. Arkon's body is also much harder and more resistant to physical injury than the body of a human being.

'''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Despite his great resilience, Arkon can be injured. However, he can regenerate damaged tissue with much greater speed and efficiency than a human. However, he isn't capable of regenerating missing limbs, organs, or brain cells.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 1 1}}

| Abilities               = Arkon is a cunning military strategist and an excellent hand to hand combatant. He is also a skilled swordsman and is skilled in the use of throwing weapons, such as spears and javelins.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 1 1}}

| Strength                = Arkon possesses superhuman strength, and can lift 2 tons.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 1 1}}
| Weaknesses              = 

| Equipment               = 
| Transportation          = Arkon's golden bolts are designed to open temporary portals between dimensions, permitting him access to alternate worlds. His more conventional means of transportation includes the use of reptilian, dinosaur-like, steeds, such as [[Karia (Earth-616)|Karia]].<br>

| Weapons                 = Arkon wields two other types of energy bolts that are used as weapons. Each of them are shaped like a stylized lightning bolt, and are solid until they hit their target. At that point, the bolts convert to pure energy. They are each thrown like a short javelin and are carried in a quiver. The specific nature of the energy that creates these dimensional rifts is not yet known. His scarlet bolts are weapons of destruction, creating a force equivalent to 10 pounds of TNT.  His black bolts, sometimes called D-Bolts, are his most powerful energy weapons, capable of exerting a force equivalent to 20 tons of TNT, sufficient power to shatter a medium-sized mountain.

| Notes                   = * Arkon's appearances on Earth inspired a series of popular sword-and-sorcery action movies starring [[Arnold Schwarzburger (Earth-616)|Arnold Schwarzburger]], one of which starred Simon Williams ([[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]]), who got his first big break as the villain in ''Arkon IV''.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 6}}{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 31}}
