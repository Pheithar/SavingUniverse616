===Youth===
Zorba Fortunov was the son of [[Vladimir Fortunov (Earth-616)|King Vladimir]] of Latveria and brother to [[Rudolfo Fortunov (Earth-616)|Rudolfo]], heir apparent to the throne.{{r|Fantastic Four #199}} As a member of the Royal Family, Zorba was familiar with the rooms of several castles of Latveria<ref name="castle">In {{cl|Fantastic Four #198}}, Zorba recognizes the rooms of [[Castle Doom (Doomstadt)|Doctor Doom's Castle]]. In {{cl|Books of Doom #6}}, we see that Zorba inhabited Vladimir's castle but, after deposing Vladimir, Doom chose a different castle in Latveria as his headquarters.</ref> including one that had been home of the hereditary rulers of the country, but had stopped to be.{{r|Fantastic Four #350}}

===Doom takes Latveria===
King Vladimir was deposed and murdered by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Victor von Doom]] (styled Doctor Doom), who usurped the Latverian throne{{r|Books of Doom #6}} and later murdered Rudolfo,{{r|Fantastic Four #198}} who had become a leader of a resistance movement.{{r|Astonishing Tales #1}} Doom also captured Zorba and ordered his scientist [[Gustav Hauptmann (Earth-616)|Gustav Hauptmann]] to perform unethical experiments on Zorba's eye, leaving him blind of the right eye. The socket was filled in with a showy cybernetic implant{{r|Fantastic Four #198}} which happened to include an energy blast weapon,{{r|Fantastic Four #199}} the '''Nega-Beam Blast'''. Doom was careful to include a specific shield on [[Doctor Doom's Armor|his omnipresent armor]] that protected him against this ray.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}} Zorba eventually escaped or was released, keeping a personal grudge against Hauptmann and his family.{{r|Fantastic Four #198}}

[[File:Gustav Hauptmann, Zorba Fortunov, Zorba's Eye (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 15.jpg|thumb|left|Zorba is tortured]]
===Resistance Leader===
Zorba reappeared in the public scene, claiming the throne for himself and using persuasion to propel rebellion among the people.{{r|Fantastic Four #246}} Zorba also replaced Rudolfo as the leader of the '''Latverian Freedom Fighters''', which numbered less than fifty individuals including a man named Koro,{{r|Fantastic Four #198}} all of them hidden in a secret headquarters in the Latverian hills.{{r|Fantastic Four #198}}<ref name="D27">''[[Domains of Doom]]'', Chapter 3: Doom: The Beginning</ref> Their goal was to replace Doom with Rudolfo's heir, then restore democracy in Latveria. They discovered, however, that Doom intended to follow the letter of the law and abdicate in favor of his supposed son [[Victor von Doom (Clone) (Earth-616)|Victor von Doom II]], unknown to everyone until that moment. Zorba planned to stage a direct attack during the coronation ceremony.{{r|Fantastic Four #198}} To that end, Zorba had smuggled weapons to Latveria, arming his men.{{r|Fantastic Four #199}}

Doom's enemy [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]], a superhero member of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], sneaked into Latveria to confront Doom, but he was injured by one of Doom's [[Guardian Robots|border guard robots.]] Fantastic was found by resistance members and taken to their headquarters, where Zorba explained Fantastic Doom's plan and recruited Fantastic for his cause. Fantastic convinced Zorba to forfeit his riskful strategy and instead use Fantastic's powers to ensure a stealth assault: Fantastic's elasticity allowed him to help Zorba's men climb a steep mountain, then hid them from Doom's [[Eye-Spy]] drone; lastly, Fantastic entered Doom's Castle and lowered the drawbridge to allow Zorba and his men to enter.{{r|Fantastic Four #198}}

[[File:Reed_Richards,_Zorba_Fortunov_(Earth-616)_from_Fantastic_Four_198.jpg|thumb|right|Zorba with Mr Fantastic]]
The freedom fighters assaulted the castle.{{r|Fantastic Four #198}}<ref name="D27" /><ref name="D47">''[[Domains of Doom]]'', Chapter 3: Doom: The Villain: The Son of Doom</ref> Once inside, Zorba's men were surprised by a gas-based trap. Zorba asked Fantastic to leave them and continue the mission but, when Fantastic took only Zorba with him, Zorba was angry at having left his men behind. Fantastic explained him that Doom was not likely to murder the intruders at once. Their conversation was interrupted by{{r|Fantastic Four #198}} the arrival of Doom's scientist [[Gert Hauptmann (Earth-616)|Gert Hauptmann]] - brother to Gustav -<ref name="D49" /> who was looking for the cause of the alarm. Zorba charged against Hauptmann, but Fantastic rescued the scientist.{{r|Fantastic Four #198}} Having captured Hauptmann, Mr. Fantastic impersonated him in an attempt to trick Doom,{{r|Fantastic Four #198}}<ref name="D49" /> but he failed and was captured by Doom.{{r|Fantastic Four #198}}<ref name="D27" /><ref name="D49" />

Zorba gained access to some documents he identified as Doom's personal diary, which Zorba was unable to understand completely due to Doom using difficult mathematics equations. Zorba discovered part of the truth about Doom's heir, mostly that the later was not Doom's son as expected.{{r|Fantastic Four #199}} Unable to infiltrate the castle properly,<ref name="D49" /> Zorba left and gathered his surviving men to stir up the crowds in front of the castle. Zorba, shouting among the crowd, demanded an audience with Doom and, when Doom appeared in a balcony, Zorba threatened to reveal the truth. Doom silenced him by shooting energy blasts to the crowd, exciting the Latverians. Zorba reacted by showing his men's weapons and apparently endangering the civilian population should Doom refused to abdicate. Doom however appeased the people by promising that he would abdicate as promised.{{r|Fantastic Four #199}}<ref name="D49" />

Later that day, Doom staged the coronation ceremony with a honor guard of [[Omni-Bots (Earth-616)|Omni-Bots]] and quite a tense audience. Zorba told an ally of his, Kronar, that he intended to infiltrate the castle and release Fantastic and his allies.{{r|Fantastic Four #199}} Zorba entered the castle during the first stages of the ceremony,{{r|Fantastic Four #199}}<ref name="D27" /><ref name="D49" /> defeated a [[Servo-Guards|Servo-Guard]] with his eye blast,{{r|Fantastic Four #199}} then switched off the monitoring crystal that was holding the Fantastic Four prisoners,{{r|Fantastic Four #199}}<ref name="D49" /> thus releasing them.{{r|Fantastic Four #199}}<ref name="D27" /><ref name="D49" /> Zorba then shared Doom's diary with Fantastic, and Fantastic quickly understood that Victor II was a clone of Doom, an information he in turn revealed to Zorba.{{r|Fantastic Four #199}}

Zorba and the Fantastic Four interrupted the ceremony, with Zorba shouting that Doom's heir was a clone and that Doom should have said the truth. Doom unleashed the Omni-Bots to attack the Fantastic Four and Zorba,{{r|Fantastic Four #199}}<ref name="D27" /><ref name="D49" /> scaring the population.{{r|Fantastic Four #199}} However, the clone revealed that he had duplicated the powers of the Fantastic Four and that he did not share Doom's madness. He confronted Doom, only to die at his hands.{{r|Fantastic Four #199}}<ref name="D27" />

While Doom tried to adapt his plan, Zorba gathered the people and led a crowd demanding Doom's abdication. Doom answered by activating his [[Vortex Machine]] to create a cyclone that wreak havoc among the crowd. Zorba escaped with minor injuries, entered the Castle and helped the Fantastic Four look for clues and release [[Alicia Masters (Earth-616)|Alicia Masters]], who was also Doom's prisoner. The Fantastic Four discovered Doom's next steps and went to [[New York City]] to prevent Doom from taking over the [[United Nations]] using the [[Solartron]] machine, with Zorba staying in Latveria. While fighting Fantastic, Doom lost his mask and his lenses - which protected him from maddening images and, seeing his disfigured face reflected one million times, went into catatonia.{{r|Fantastic Four #200}}

===King Zorba===
Zorba was then crowned king of Latveria and took power, purportedly for a month until he could hold elections;{{r|Fantastic Four #200}}{{r|Fantastic Four #247}} and kept the mindless Doom in a padded room,{{r|Fantastic Four #200}}<ref name="D49" /> covered in bandages and with Hauptmann and his qualified staff in charge of Doom's care.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}} As the monarch, Zorba occupied Castle Doom<ref name="D13">''[[Domains of Doom]]'' Chapter 2: Locations of Interest : Castle Doom</ref> and took an adviser named Starn.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}}

The Fantastic Four gave their support to Zorba's rule, attending his crowning ceremony.{{r|Fantastic Four #200}} However, the military leaders who had thrived under Doom refused to obey Zorba and instead they went missing, joining an underground movement of Doom loyalists that also included an undercover agent in the Castle: Hauptmann. This was the first problem of Zorba: Doom's military strength gave Latveria an stability that Zorba was not matching.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}}

Zorba also failed to earn money as fast as Doom could. Zorba was forced to increase prices<ref name="D51">''[[Domains of Doom]]'' Chapter 3: Doom: The Villain: Doom's Return</ref> and taxes,{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}}<ref name="D51" /> quickly decreasing the treasury and the Latverians' standard of living.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}} 

As Zorba revoked Doom's punishment and laws, crime -which was almost null under Doom's reign- reappeared in a matter of days and became a major concern.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}<ref name="D55">''[[Domains of Doom]]'' Chapter 3: Doom: The Master</ref> Soon afterward, inflation skyrocketed,{{r|Fantastic Four #247}} and stocks of food ran out.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}<ref name="D55" /> Zorba reacted by raising the taxes<ref name="D55" /> but his reforms sank Latveria into misery.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}

The day before the scheduled elections,{{r|Fantastic Four #247}} Zorba instituted martial law, cancelling the elections until the situation could be corrected, then reprogrammed Doom's Servo-Guard robots as his own secret police force,{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}<ref name="D55" /> with the authority to execute Latverians on sight for even minor crimes such as violating curfew.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}

Zorba was soon confronted with unsatisfied mobs asking for Doom's return.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}}<ref name="D51" /> Starn told Zorba that the mob was not really significant, but in any case a rebellion could succeed in getting the throne - as Zorba had proven.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}}

Although Zorba made international P.R. movements like staging a exhibit of the Latverian crown jewels in the [[United Nations Headquarters]], even the Latverian ambassador to the U.N., Dr. Arturo Frazen, had noticed that Zorba's rule was leading Latveria to bankruptcy - Frazen himself intended to steal the jewels for himself before Zorba was forced to sell them to inject liquidity.{{r|Dazzler #3}}

Worried about Doom escaping, Zorba checked him in his padded chamber and noticed that Doom was strangely motionless. He ordered to remove the bandages and he discovered it was a robot that then exploded at being discovered. Zorba fired Hauptmann and their staff,{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}}<ref name="D51" /> as their incompetence<ref name="D51" /> had been unable to prevent the loyalists from kidnapping Doom - Zorba initially believed that Doom had escaped himself, but Starn convinced him that Doom was unable to do so. Starn then suggested Zorba to infiltrate an agent among Doom's loyalists, but Zorba refused to authorize such an unethical tactic. Meanwhile, Hauptmann told the loyalists of Zorba's discovery, and they decided to stage a quick mission to recover Doom's armor from the Castle.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}}

After a nightmare about his eye surgery and Doom, Zorba reasoned that Hauptmann was a traitor and that the loyalist may try to steal Doom's armor.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}} Zorba went to protect the armor, but he bumped into the loyalist commandos sent to steal it.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}}<ref name="D51" /> The commandos stunned Zorba with a gas weapon,{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}} but Zorba managed to capture one of the enemy agents,{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}}<ref name="D51" /> a Strego, using a chain as an ad-hoc weapon.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}} Zorba ordered Starn to allow Strego's escape so that trusted agents could follow him to the loyalist headquarters. This plan was successful and Zorba discovered the loyalists' lair in a hidden cave. He immediately went there with the army. When he arrived, the loyalists had successfully restored Doom's mind. Doom easily scattered Zorba's troops on his own.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}}<ref name="D51" />

Doom, hidden in the Citadel of Doom,<ref name="D14">''[[Domains of Doom]]'' Chapter 2: Locations of Interest: Citadel of Doom</ref> started his gambit to recover the throne from exile.<ref name="D51" /> Doom also stole one of the [[Stones of Merlin]] from Zorba's exhibit, murdering Frazen and confronting the [[mutant]] superhero [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]].{{r|Dazzler #3}}

Soon afterward, millionaire industrialist [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Anthony Stark]] visited Latveria also looking for Doom, who had became his enemy. Zorba's troops greeted Stark at the airport and gave him a map of the Citadel; Zorba wanted Stark's bodyguard [[Iron Man]] to harass Doom.<ref name="D52">''[[Domains of Doom]]'' Chapter 3: Doom: The Villain: Camelot's Doom</ref>

Doom gained control over the [[Latverian Embassy]] in New York City in his scheme to recover the throne. He captured the Fantastic Four, then submitted them to an [[Inhibitor Ray]] so that they could not attack Doom, then took them to Latveria in a [[Saucer Ship]],{{r|Fantastic Four #246}} where he explained to them the disasters of Zorba's rule.{{r|Fantastic Four #245}}<ref name="D55" /> The skeptic heroes met a Latverian gypsy woman and [[Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)|her child]], both of whom were happy to see Doom back and scared of Zorba's robots.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}<ref name="D55" /> Doom placed the woman under his protection, only to see her murdered by Zorba's secret police just moments later.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}<ref name="D55" /><ref name="D22>''[[Domains of Doom]]'' Chapter 2: NPCs of Latveria: Doctor Doom II (Kristoff)</ref> The Fantastic Four joined Doom to fight the robots, then the five of them joined the resistance against Zorba's government - led by Josef, Burgermeister of Doomstadt,{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}<ref name="D55" /> the resistance hid in the same headquarters Zorba had used in his freedom fighter times. Josef was initially skeptic, believing that Doom's appearance may be a trick of Zorba's, but once he was convinced, he explained to the newcomers about Zorba's atrocities.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}

Meanwhile, Zorba was losing his mind.<ref name="D55" /> He had captured Doom's servant and friend [[Boris Karela (Earth-616)|Boris]]{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}<ref name="D55" /> - the man who had released Doom from his prison-{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}} but not even his brutal tortures could make loyal Boris cooperate. Knowing that people opposed the freedom Zorba believed to be distributing, Zorba reacted by unleashing Doom's [[Invincible Robots]] against the population,{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}<ref name="D55" /> even if Zorba's colonel found the idea to be horrible.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}} The Fantastic Four and Doom confronted the robots and stopped them{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}<ref name="D55" /> after several hours.<ref name="D55" />

When the battle was almost won, Doom then infiltrated the castle, released Boris and went to Zorba's private rooms to confront him.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}<ref name="D55" /> Doom's explosive entrance knocked down the colonel. While Doom accused Zorba of being petty and corrupt, Zorba tried to attack Doom with the Nega-Beam Blast - but Doom was protected against it.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}} Doom took Zorba over the castle wall, having a chance to drop him to his death, while Zorba, irrationally, insisted that Doom could not recover the throne while he, Zorba, was still alive. Apparently, Doom executed Zorba on the charge of treason, albeit he never confirmed it.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}<ref name="D55" />

Doom recovered his status as ruler of Latveria{{r|Fantastic Four #247}}<ref name="D55" /> and allowed the Fantastic Four to leave.{{r|Fantastic Four #247}} Soon, Doom restored Latveria to its healthy status before Zorba's times.{{r|Fantastic Four #258}}<ref name="55B">''[[Domains of Doom]]'' Chapter 3: Doom: The  Master: Cosmic Revenge</ref> Having been released from Zorba's police state horrors, the Latverian people again revered Doom.<ref name="D14B">''[[Domains of Doom]]'' Chapter 2: Citizens</ref>
