| History                 = After [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-18897)|Gamora]] donned the identity of [[Requiem]] and set out to collect the [[Infinity Stones]], Phyla-Vell and [[Heather Douglas (Earth-18897)|Moondragon]] travelled to the neighboring universe of [[Earth-616]] to retrieve their universe's [[Reality Stone]] since each version of this artifact across the [[Multiverse]] had become displaced to an adjacent universe. They confronted [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] and [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]]. They handed over the Reality Stone to Phyla-Vell since it was useless in their universe.{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 4}} Moondragon eventually hid the stone and erased her memories of the event.

Requiem captured Phyla-Vell and Moondragon before killing [[Loki Odinson (Earth-18897)|Loki Odinson]] and taking the Infinity Stones in his possession for herself. Moondragon tricked Gamora into reading her mind for the Reality Stone's location, allowing her to lock Gamora in mental combat. Phyla-Vell hesitated to strike since it would have been harmful for Moondragon to be connected to Gamora's mind when she killed her. Their window of opportunity closed, and Gamora prepared to reassert control after learning the location of the Reality Stone. Since their universe was now doomed, Moondragon took advantage of her connection to Gamora before it was broken to make her use the Infinity Stones to shoot herself and Phyla-Vell out of the universe and into Earth-616 to escape Requiem.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 4}}

Phyla-Vell and Moondragon arrived at the [[Quarry of Creation]], where Earth-616's [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]] was trying to dig through an unbrekable barrier. They attacked Gamora in retaliation for the actions of her counterpart from their world, but their attacks were deflected without effort. After [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]] and his [[Cosmic Avengers (Earth-616)|Cosmic Avengers]] confronted Gamora and defeated her, the trickster god pulled Gamora through a portal to [[Soulworld|Soul World]], accidentally taking Phyla-Vell and Moondragon with her. They joined forces with [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]] and his allies to fight Gamora.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 5}} The Cosmic Avengers then returned to Soul World to stop the monstrous [[Devondra (Earth-616)|Devondra]] and change [[Warp World]] back into the real world. When they all returned to the real world, Phyla-Vell and Moondragon tried to kill Gamora, but [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] convinced them not to. After Warlock used the Soul Gem to give the rest of the Infinity Stones their own souls and they fled away, all parties involved in the conflict parted ways. Phyla-Vell and Moondragon left to explore the new universe they would inhabit from then on.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 6}}

She and Moondragon were present at a gathering held by [[Eros (Earth-616)|Starfox]] to show the will of his brother, the Mad Titan [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]], which revealed that he would resurrect himself having his consciousness take over the body of another. As those gathered discussed what to do with this new information, the gathering were attacked by the [[Black Order (Earth-616)|Black Order]], and everyone was sucked into a black hole created by the Order. Vell and Moondragon along with an alternate reality [[Frank Castle (Earth-TRN666)|Ghost Rider]] were rescued thanks to [[Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616)|Beta Ray Bill]] and his hammer [[Stormbreaker]], and all were recruited into the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] by Star-Lord.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 1}}

The Rider later left the team after Star-Lord refused to do anything about Thanos' resurrection, but Vell and Moondragon chose to remain.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 2}} After talking it over with Bill and [[Groot (Earth-616)|Groot]], Vell, Moondragon, and the other Guardians decided to protect former Gamora from being targeted as it was believed that she was the most likely person Thanos would resurrect himself in. After staging a mutiny against Star-Lord, the other Guardians traveled to [[Halfworld]] where Gamora was watching over [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]]. Gamora was convinced to accompany the Guardians. Then [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] appeared to warn them of the [[Dark Guardians (Earth-616)|Dark Guardians]]' mission to kill Gamora but realized too late that the Dark Guardians had followed him to find Gamora. After forcing the Guardians' ship [[Ryder (Vehicle)|The Ryder]] to crash, the Guardians battled the Dark Guardians, but the Guardians were defeated, and the Dark Guardians took Gamora.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 3|4}}

The Guardians were able to use the teleportation power of the Inhuman dog [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]] to reach the Dark Guardians' ship. After arriving, however, they found the Dark Guardians defeated. Gamora told them Hela had taken Eros, the actual intended host for Thanos' consciousness, to [[Knowhere]] so the Mad Titan could be fully resurrected. Not long after, the two teams joined forces and succeeded in preventing the return of Thanos.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 2|6}}

Following a disastrous mission against the [[Olympians]] that resulted in Star-Lord's apparent death,{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 1|2}} a grief-stricken Gamora formed [[West Spiral Arm Guardians (Earth-616)|her own team of mercenary Guardians]] and accepted a mercenary job offer from [[Castor Gnawbarque III (Earth-616)|Castor Gnawbarque III]] that pitted the two Guardians teams against each other.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 3}} During this clash, Moondragon was confronted by her [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|native counterpart]] and the two ultimately merged into a single being.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 5}} Phyla-Vell was initially distant toward the composite Moondragon, out of discomfort that her wife's soul had merged with somebody that was virtually a stranger to her,{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 7}} and didn't know where "her" Heather ended and the other one began.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 11}} During the Guardians' final fight against the Olympians, who were heralded by the returned Star-Lord, Moondragon was telepathically attacked by [[Hermes Diaktoros (Earth-616)|Hermes]]. Managing to enter into Moondragon's mindscape, Phyla professed that she wished to know and love the entirety of the new Moodragon, both patching up their relationship and giving Moondragon the necessary boost to defeat Hermes.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 12}}
