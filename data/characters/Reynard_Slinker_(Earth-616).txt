| History                 = Reynard Slinker, alias the Fox, stole a Da Vinci painting and framed [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] for the crime. He was captured when Spider-Man and the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] teamed up to capture him. The painting was recovered and returned to the museum. {{r|Strange Tales Annual Vol 1 2}}
<br/>

He returned years later, a bitter ex-con who no longer had the respect of his peers, and was unable to keep up with the current security technology, meaning he was no longer a 'master thief'. He attempted to get revenge on Spider-Man and the Human Torch for ruining his life, setting a trap for the two heroes. The trap did not work, however, and Spidey and the Torch dragged a humiliated Reynard back to prison. {{r|Spider-Man Unlimited Vol 1 5}}
