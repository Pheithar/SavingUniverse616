At some point in his life, he became a medical expert and was recruited by [[Singularity Investigations (Earth-616)|Singularity Investigations]]. After one of [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]]s dupes destroyed Singularity Investigations, Doc Locked joined [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 15}}

Soon after, [[Ms. Diaz (Earth-616)|Ms. Diaz]] kidnapped Madrox Prime, believing he was his [[James Madrox (S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent) (Earth-616)|dupe]] who was working for [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Doc Locke tortured him mentally.
