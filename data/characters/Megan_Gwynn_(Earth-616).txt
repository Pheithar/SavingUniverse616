===Origin===
'''Megan Gwynn''', also known as '''Pixie''', was raised by her grandparents in the small mining town of [[Abergylid]] in [[Wales]]. Her [[Homo superior|mutant]] powers manifested in a near-miss road accident involving her bicycle and another car. She could manifest rainbow-colored butterfly wings allowing her to fly with great maneuverability.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2008 X-Men}}

===Paragon Squad===
After enrolling at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]], Megan was assigned to the [[Paragons Squad (Earth-616)|Paragons]] training squad under the tutelage of former [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutant]], [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 12}} When it was discovered that Wolfsbane had been in a romantic relationship with a student, [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]], she left the school, and was replaced by her former teammate, [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 15}}
[[File:Paragons Squad (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 12 0001.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Megan with Wolfsbane]]

Gwynn proved herself to be an amiable and cheerful student, and she fit in well with her squad. Following [[Decimation|M-Day]], nearly all of the Institute's students were depowered, leading to the dissolution of the school's training squads. Gwynn was one of only 27 students, along with her fellow former Paragons, [[Hope Abbott (Earth-616)|Trance]], [[Nicholas Gleason (Earth-616)|Wolf Cub]], and [[Ben Hammil (Earth-616)|Match]], to have retained their mutant abilities. Forty-two of Gwynn's former classmates were killed when a bus carrying several depowered students was ambushed. Among the confirmed deaths was Gwynn's fellow Paragon [[Mark Sheppard (Earth-616)|DJ]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 24}}

===Limbo===
Pixie, along with [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]], [[Alani Ryan (Earth-616)|Loa]], Wolf Cub, [[Nezhno Abidemi (Earth-616)|Gentle]], [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]], and Match, were told a frightening "ghost story" one night at the school by their fellow student, [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]]. Pixie, frightened by the story, told Blindfold that she didn't like her anymore. Blindfold apologized to her and told her, "I'm sorry for your loss". It soon turned out that this tale wasn't a story at all, but rather a vision of things past and of things to come.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 37}} The group was soon sucked down into the realm of [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]], where they were immediately attacked by a mob of demons. Pixie stayed by Blindfold's side during the fight, and Blindfold cautioned Pixie and the others that Gwynn must not "fall into darkness". She used her powers for the first time, incapacitating several demons with her "pixie dust", causing them to suffer psychedelic hallucinations. She admitted to not knowing what they saw in their hallucinations.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 38}} After [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Illyana Rasputin]], now known as Darkchylde, saved the small group, she asked [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]] to bring Megan to her. Despite her friends' trying to stop her, Megan gave into Darkchylde's request for a portion of her soul to create a [[Soulsword]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 39}} Illyana then explained that the knife was actually a portion of Pixie's own soul, which is why her [[Souldagger]] was smaller than the original Soulsword. Black magic could now fill the hole left behind in the knife's creation, leaving Pixie no longer an innocent personality as well as changing a great portion of her hair black instead of the previous pink.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 40}}
[[File:Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616) and Megan Gwynn (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 41 0001.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Learning magic from Illyana]]

Pixie was taught a teleportation spell by Illyana. She teleported her and her friends to [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]] to stop him from torturing the rest of the team. She was then told that in order to save her friends she must use her knife to stab Belasco. Initially hesitant, Pixie followed through with her orders and lost more of her innocence by killing the villain. After defeating Belasco and escaping from Limbo, Pixie was officially made a member of the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 41}}

Pixie was sitting in the medical lab along with [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]] and Nezhno where she revealed that when she was of age, [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]] would tutor her in magic. She was questioned by [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]] about her age because Mercury was trying to find out who is the youngest mutant alive now that more mutants weren't being born. [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]] assumed she was the youngest because she was the most immature. Megan questioned Sooraya about her religion and gushed over how Nehzno protected her in Limbo. Later she participated in a training session with [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] where she made him see unicorns. {{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}}

Pixie, along with the other New X-Men, took part in a battle against the [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]] when they attacked the mansion seeking the [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny]] [[Destiny's Books|Diaries]]. Blindfold later stated that Pixie would soon be injured.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 201|203}}

===[[Messiah Complex]]===
When the first new mutant since M-Day appeared, Pixie joined [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]], Hellion, Anole, [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]], [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]], and Rockslide in attacking the [[Washington, D.C.]] base of the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] by teleporting them there. They were opposed by [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]] and the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]]. When Julian was injured and the Reavers were about to attack, Pixie panicked and couldn't teleport the team out until [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]], who had infiltrated the Purifiers as a spy, told her to concentrate or else they would all die. Pixie did so, but blindly teleported the team, scattering them between Washington, D.C. and the Xavier Institute. Injured, she mentally called out to [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], breaking Emma's concentration on the fight between a group of X-Men and the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 44}}
[[File:Megan Gwynn (Earth-616) from X-Men Messiah Complex Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Pixie with her New X-Men Costume]]

Later, back at the mansion, she was with several other students and [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] when [[Predator X]] attacked several students outside, then changed tactics to go after the weaker wounded students in the infirmary. Pixie, realizing that X-23 had killed this type of creature before, attempted to teleport Predator X to X-23's location, but mistakenly took the majority of the students and Beast along with her and the creature, dropping them in the middle of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]'s fight with the Marauders on [[Muir Island]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 46}}

During the fight, Pixie was brutally beaten by the [[Alice MacAllister (Earth-616)|Malice]]-possessed [[Karima Shapandar (Earth-616)|Omega Sentinel]], who taunted Pixie until Megan unexpectedly stabbed her foe with her Soul Dagger, exorcising Malice from Omega Sentinel's body. She was later consoled by Mercury after [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] was shot and mortally wounded.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 207}}

===Nation X===
After the disbanding of the X-Men, Pixie went home to [[Abergylid]] to find the townspeople possessed by [[Demons]]. With help from the X-Men, Pixie defeated the demons and liberated her home. Afterward, Pixie accepted the X-Men's invitation to relocate to [[San Francisco]].{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2008 X-Men}} 

After the X-Men settled in San Francisco, Pixie was beaten up by racist Hellfire thugs, secretly being controlled by [[Manuel de la Rocha (Earth-616)|Empath]] and [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 500}} Determined not to let them get the best of her, she healed up and stabbed Empath, who had been giving the X-Men quite a hard time, in the head with her Soul Dagger.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 503}}

During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], Pixie joined the team in the fight to defend the city. She was even assigned her own team to battle the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]].{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men Vol 1 1|3}}

===X-Infernus===
After a mishap with her Souldagger while training with [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], Pixie draws the [[Soulsword]] from his chest. Sensing the sword's presence from Limbo, Illyana teleported to the X-Men's base to retrieve her sword. Pixie fought Darkchylde, demanding the missing piece of her soul back, but Illyana triumphs and teleports back to Limbo with her Soulsword.{{r|X-Infernus Vol 1 1|2}}
[[File:X-Infernus Vol 1 2 textless.jpg|left|thumb|180px]]

The X-Men assemble a team and teleport to Limbo using Pixie's magic, but are beset by demons. At Belasco's castle, Magik is defeated and captured by Belasco's daughter, [[Ananym (Earth-616)|Witchfire]], who is planning to take over Limbo by using the bloodstones, made long ago from Magik's soul, to summon the Elder Gods. Witchfire combines her three bloodstones with the one Magik made from Pixie's soul, which summons Pixie to her side. Witchfire declares Pixie to be her apprentice and starts the process to make the fifth and final bloodstone from Pixie's soul. Pixie takes on a demonic appearance, but the ritual is interrupted by Nightcrawler and the X-Men who have teleported in. Nightcrawler uses Pixie's soul dagger to stab Magik and thus draw out her Soulsword, but Witchfire completes her spell and creates the final bloodstone.{{r|X-Infernus Vol 1 3}} Nightcrawler cuts off Witchfire's hand as she draws the bloodstone from Pixie, but Witchfire is still able to summon the Elder Gods. Magik, wearing the immune-to-magic [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]] as armor, is able to defeat Witchfire and retrieve the Bloodstone Amulet. Magik and Pixie combine their soul weapons to remove the latest bloodstone from the Witchfire's amulet, reversing her spell and banishing the Elder Gods. Witchfire escapes with the bloodstone amulet with four of five bloodstones (the original three created from Magik's soul and the one Magik created from Pixie). Pixie turns her soul dagger on Magik, only to discover her dagger has been enhanced by the fifth bloodstone. She flies away in anger.{{r|X-Infernus Vol 1 4}}

===Pixie Strikes Back===
Pixie found herself and several of her teenage teammates under a spell, causing them to live under the impression that they were ordinary high school girls with no memories of the X-Men.{{r|X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back Vol 1 1}}
[[File:X-Men Pixie Strikes Back Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pixie and the other X-Girls]]

However, the illusion began to fade, with Pixie finding herself in confrontation with the demon [[Saturnine (Earth-616)|Saturnine]]. Meanwhile, a woman arrived on Utopia claiming to be her mother and demanding to see her. Later, her mother showed up in the Wyngarde mansion, where [[Regan Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Lady Mastermind]] was fighting with [[Martinique Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Martinique]]. She told them to stop acting like the babies of the family and that they have been usurped. Pixie was revealed to be [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Jason Wyngarde]]'s daughter and the Mastermind sisters' sibling.{{r|X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back Vol 1 2}}

===Second Coming: Hellbound===
During the [[Second Coming]] event, the demons [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]] and [[S'ym (Earth-616)|S'ym]] cut a deal with Bastion's forces and provided them with a "weaponized ritual" that sent Magik back to Limbo. When the X-Men teleport in a team to rescue her, S'ym and N'astirh approach Pixie to make another deal: if Pixie will kill Magik, and take her soulsword to N'astirh, he will return the missing piece of Pixie's soul and free her from Limbo's darkness forever. After Pixie turns on him and frees Magik, they assist Anole and Cannonball against some corrupted X-Men. After the battle ends the two girls came to understand each other better.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Hellbound Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Men: Hellbound Vol 1 3|3]]}}

===Project Purgatory===
Megan was captured by the [[Project Purgatory (Earth-616)|Project Purgatory]] who stole her Soul Dagger{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 15}} and ripped out another piece of her soul.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 19}} After [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]] destroyed the Elder Gods, Illyana returned the two [[Bloodstones]] and Soul Dagger to Pixie.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 21}}

===Schism===
After battling [[Sentinels]] across the globe,{{r|X-Men: Schism Vol 1 3}} Pixie was injured.{{r|X-Men: Schism Vol 1 4}}{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 11}} While in the infirmary, she flirted with [[Gabriel Cohuelo (Earth-616)|Velocidad]] unaware he was dating [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]]. While they kissed, a very angry and jealous Hope interrupted the pair, making Pixie realize they were together and slapping Velocidad in the face. Later, as Pixie packed for the return to [[Westchester County|Westchester]], Hope approached her with a request to join the team to offer them faster transport. Pixie accepted and began training with the [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]].{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 12|13}} Pixie took part on a mission when a "new light" appeared only to find out it was Sebastian Shaw. She was frozen by Jin Billion's men but her teammates saved her. Pixie also took part in stopping [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Zero]] from killing Hope.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 13|17}}

===Back to School===
[[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]] attacked the Jean Grey School to impel Wolverine's X-Men return to Utopia. He changed his mind however after reading the minds of [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] and Wolverine, deciding that the best way to reunite the mutant race was to kill [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]. Pixie and the other students came to help when Rogue's message was sent to Utopia, much to the displeasure of Wolverine. After the battle was over, Rogue offered Pixie and the other young mutants a place in the school, but she and the others refused the offer.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 262|263}}

When [[Unit (Earth-616)|Unit]] escaped from [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D]] and tricked Cyclops' X-Men into believing a new mutant emerged. Hope and her team were sent and found only Unit waiting for them. Unit controlled the Lights to stand down, teleport away, and fall asleep, leaving him to speak with Hope.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 9|10}}

Megan was one of the young X-Men who were captured by the Avengers and sent to the Avengers Academy.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 29|31}} Afterwards, she made her way to the Jean Grey School where she eventually graduated and became a full member of the X-Men.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 42}}

===House of X===
Like countless other mutants, Pixie joined the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] following its foundation.{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}} As a representative of the nation, Pixie took part in a few international missions, encountering the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]],{{r|Champions Vol 4 4}} the [[Children of the Atom (Earth-616)|Children of the Atom]],{{r|Children of the Atom Vol 1 1}} and the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]], with whom she had a special bond.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 34}} In one of her missions to an [[Orchis (Earth-616)|Orchis]] anti-mutant museum, she discussed with her friends how she was one of the few mutants on Krakoa who had never died and been resurrected by [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]]. Encouraged by her friends, she decided to use her powers to traumatize one of the guards by making him kill her, deeply concerning Nightcrawler with her cavalier attitude towards death and the fact that, when she came back, she had lost a day of memories.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 1}}

She later joined Nightcrawler and [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Doctor Nemesis]] on a mission to rescue [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]], who she'd never met but heard a lot about from his late girlfriend Blindfold. When they found him in an Orchis base, he had been reduced to just a brain, so Kurt was forced to kill him so he could be resurrected by the Five.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 2}}

She was possessed by [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]] along with everyone on the island,{{r|Way of X Vol 1 4|5}} but eventually freed from his control. She was then sent by Legion and Nightcrawler alongside Doctor Nemesis, [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]] and [[Mark Sheppard (Earth-616)|DJ]] to deprogram everyone using her soulsword as Onslaught was making everyone commit suicide while Xavier deleted their backups preventing their resurrections. They took them through a gate into the [[House of L]], a pocket dimension in Legions mind where their thoughts could be merged, turning them into something that could defeat Legion.{{r|X-Men: The Onslaught Revelation Vol 1 1}}

Pixie is a hybrid [[Homo superior|mutant]] and [[Fairies|fairy]] and possess powers granted to her both by her [[X-Gene|mutation]] and inherent [[Magic (Power)|magical abilities]], without a clear distinction regarding the source of each power. Her powers include:

*'''Wings:''' Pixie has insectoid wings protruding from her back that allow her to engage in [[flight]] and with great maneuverability. Her wings were formerly rainbow-colored and butterfly-like,{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 5}} and after losing a piece of her soul, they were monochrome for a while,{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 40|44}} but they have since settled on a pink and blue-ish appearance.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 531}}{{r|X-Men Vol 4 3}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 4}}{{r|Runaways Vol 5 34}} Following her time in the [[Age of X]] reality, Pixie was haunted by her memories of [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-11326)|Nightmare]], her Age of X counterpart, occasionally swapping from insectoid wings to batlike wings. This shift was psychologically based, and initiated by Nightmare (as an alter ego) taking dominance. It is unknown if she still has this ability, as Pixie requested that most of Nightmare's memories be removed.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 248}}
**'''Hallucinogenic Dust:''' Pixie generates a dust that causes powerful visual and auditory hallucinations in her victims. This dust affects others by being inhaled or through skin contact. Often the hallucinations are calming and pleasant images such as teddy bears, bubbles and unicorns.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}}

*'''[[Glossary:Magic|Spell Casting]]:''' Pixie has innate magical aptitude; [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] initially promised to teach her more [[Glossary:Magic|spells]] once she turned eighteen.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}} Pixie was one of the many possible [[:Category:Sorcerer Supreme Candidates|candidates]] for the title of [[Sorcerer Supreme]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 53|54}}
**'''Teleportation:''' After the creation of her [[Souldagger]], [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Darkchylde]] taught Pixie a teleportation spell, ''"Sihal novarum chinoth!"''.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 40}} With this spell, Pixie can transport herself and others over great distances instantaneously.{{r|X-Infernus Vol 1 1}} She can also teleport inter-dimensionally.{{r|X-Men: Hellbound Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 524}} Even while inexperienced in teleporting, Pixie has shown a great amount of aptitude for it to the point where she is able to warp to and reach locations before her teleportation coach: [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]].{{r|X-Infernus Vol 1 1}} 
**'''Demons Banishment:''' Using the spell from the Cheyennes magic book, she was able to banish demons.{{r|X-Men Vol 3 15.1}}
**'''Sleeping Spell:''' [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] taught Megan a sleeping spell ''"Mists of Morpheus, go!"''{{r|Amazing X-Men Vol 2 15}}

* '''Striking the Supernatural:''' The Souldagger only harms magical creatures or objects.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 34}}

* Pixie was one of the many possible [[:Category:Sorcerer Supreme Candidates|candidates]] for the title of [[Sorcerer Supreme]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 53|54}}
* During the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]]'s abduction by [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]] into Limbo, a piece of Pixie's soul was taken by [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] and turned into a [[Souldagger]] (a smaller version of the [[Soulsword]]).{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 40}}
*After a stressful battle, Pixie and [[Nico Minoru (Earth-616)|Nico Minoru]] had a suggestive exchange of looks.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 34|35}}
**[[Rainbow Rowell]], the writer of {{cl|Runaways Vol 5}}, would later reveal that she considered Pixie to be queer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210408154952/https://twitter.com/rainbowrowell/status/1380186032889552896|title=Thank you! I didn't know much about Pixie before this. I had to do a deep dive. My editor and I chose her because we were looking for someone about Nico's age who would really complement Nico.

The moment at the end of Issue 34 is not meant to be laughed off. Pixie and Nico are having an actual moment -- though probably Pixie is being less impetuous than Nico.

But she was written as queer in Secret Wars. So this felt like a natural expansion for her character. (2 of 2)|work=Twitter|first=Rainbow|last=Rowell|date=8 April 2021|accessdate=}}</ref>
