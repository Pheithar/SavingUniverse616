===Origin===
'''Richard "Rick" Deacon''', alias the '''Human Fly''' had been in prison and his parole officer had sworn he had gone straight until he kidnapped an old man and heiress. While holding these hostages, kidnapper Rick Deacon was confronted by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and shot by the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|police]]. Wounded, he stumbled to [[Harlan Stillwell (Earth-616)|Harlan Stillwell]]'s Laboratory where he overheard [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]] asking Stillwell to create a new superhero.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #10}}

There, Deacon forced Stillwell to save his life and also give him powers. Stillwell imprinted Deacon with the genetic code of a housefly and Deacon became the Fly. In return for granting him superpowers he then killed Stillwell and set about on a life of crime. He kidnapped Jameson but was defeated by Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #10}}

During his early criminal career as the Fly he fought Spider-Man, the [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]],{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #86}} [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]],{{r|Spider-Woman #30}} and the [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]].{{r|Moon Knight #35}}

He began to lose his grip on his human origins and acted more and more like a fly, being spotted eating garbage on scows. He blamed Spider-Man and J. Jonah Jameson for the loss of his humanity and planned to kill them both, but was defeated by Spider-Man and the Black Cat.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #86}}

After his latest defeat by Spider-Man he was interned in the [[Bwainstein Psychiatric Center for the Criminally Insane]]. The [[Scourge (Delazny) (Earth-616)|Scourge of the Underworld]] tracked him there and disguised himself as a caretaker of the asylum to approach him. But the Fly escaped from his padded cell, just before the Scourge reached it. The Fly then looked for Spider-Man, who was looking for the [[Hobgoblin]]. However, the Scourge then changed his clothes to those of a garbage collector (the Fly had never seen the Scourge's current mask) to approach the Fly. The Scourge killed him in a New York City alleyway.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 276}}

Years later, he was resurrected by [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|The Hood]] (along with many supervillains killed by the Scourge) using the powers of [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]] in Robbins's plan to kill [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]]. He gained acidic vomit as well as more resilient wings as a result of an advanced mutation.{{r|Punisher Vol 8 #5}}

After robbing money from the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]], Deacon was targeted by Fisk's assassin [[Phillip Urich (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]]. By tricking [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Venom]], who was guarding his prison transfer, Richard managed to escape and join [[Nicholas Lewis, Jr. (Earth-616)|Crime-Master]]'s [[Savage Six (Crime-Master's) (Earth-616)|Savage Six]] in exchange for protection.{{r|Venom Vol 2 #16|17}} He captured [[Rose Thompson (Earth-616)|Flash's mother]] and took her to the [[Lower East Side]], where Flash interrogated him to discover Crime Master's whereabouts, tearing off both his wings.{{r|Venom Vol 2 19|20}} He was later seen arrested at the Raft.{{r|Venom Vol 2 22}} He has since been seen, free again, working for [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]].{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man Vol 1 12}}

| Powers                  = Richard Deacon possesses various superhuman attributes as a result of having various genetic traits of a common housefly imprinted onto his own genetic code.

'''Superhuman Strength:''' Deacon possesses the proportionate physical strength of a 200 pound housefly. As a result, he is superhumanly strong and is capable of lifting approximately 3 tons.

'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Deacon's musculature now generates less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. Deacon can exert himself physically at peak capacity for about 6 hours before fatigue begins to impair him.

'''Superhuman Durability:''' The tissues of Deacon's body are somewhat harder and tougher than those of an ordinary human. While far from invulnerable, Deacon is able to withstand impact and concussive forces that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no discomfort. For instance, Deacon can withstand a fall from a height of 40 feet without sustaining even the slightest injury, provided he lands on his feet.

'''Superhuman Agility:''' Deacon's natural agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical capability of even the finest human athlete.

'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Deacon's reaction time is similarly enhanced. His reflexes are superior to those of even the finest human athlete.

'''Adhesive Capability:''' Deacon's toes and fingers are covered in small, adhesive-secreting glands that enable him to cling to most conventional materials, similar to that of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] though this ability isn't nearly as developed as his.

'''Multi-Faceted Eyes:''' Deacon's globular, multi-faceted eyes enable him to see 360 degrees above, around, or below his head at all times. Whereas human eyes confine perception to a narrow field of view, Deacon's eyes devote equal importance an all possible viewpoint angles.

'''Wings:''' Deacon is able to fly through the air via the use of tough, membrane-like wings. He is able to propel himself at speeds of at least 69 miles per hour. He is typically able to support his own weight plus an additional 150 lbs while in flight and still fly at his top speed. Deacon's wings produce a high pitched buzzing sound and he can vibrate his wings in opposite directions at tremendous speeds for the purpose of creating a powerful shockwave. At its maximum, the wave can hit with a concussive force equal to about 50 pounds of TNT. His wings have been shown to regenerate themselves if damaged or torn off.

'''Acidic Vomit:''' Deacon can produce an acid capable of destroying tissues and different types of metal.
