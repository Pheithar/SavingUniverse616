| History                 = 
===Early life===
Born the only daughter to Gregson and Janet Grant, Greer Grant lived in Chicago all her life, and eventually fell in love with a policeman, [[William Nelson (Earth-616)|William Nelson]] while attending her sophomore year of college. As Will was protective of her, wanting to be the hero in their relationship, Greer chose to drop out of college to be a housewife. However, when they came upon a robbery in progress after a night out, Will was fatally shot and died in her arms. Being unable to afford her home and unable to get a job due to her dropping out, she found good luck in becoming the laboratory assistant to [[Joanne Tumolo (Earth-616)|Dr. Joanne Tumolo]], her college professor.{{r|The Cat Vol 1 1|4}}

===The Cat===
[[File:Greer Grant (Earth-616) from The Cat Vol 1 1 001.jpg|180px|thumb|right|As The Cat]]
Out of financial desperation, Dr. Tumolo had accepted private funding for her project from [[Malcolm Donalbain (Earth-616)|Malcolm Donalbain]], an eccentric who planned to use her conditioning equipment in his nationwide chain of health clubs. Not trusting the test subject that Donalbain had coerced her to use, Tumolo had Greer secretly undertake the experiment alongside Donalbain's test subject, [[Shirlee Bryant (Earth-616)|Shirlee Bryant]], and Greer Nelson emerged from the treatments with superhuman physical capabilities, and heightened senses. However, after Tumolo discovered Shirley dressed in one of Donalbain's specially designed cat costumes, Bryant died in a test of her abilities. After Donalbain had his henchmen set off explosives in the laboratory staged like an accident, Tumolo was injured. Believing her mentor to be dead, Greer was determined to stop Donalbain's plans, she donned a stolen costume, and went calling herself the Cat. She thwarted Donalbain's plans, but due to his intense haphephobia, he committed suicide. Sometime after this, Greer learned that Tumolo wasn't killed but rather hospitalized for apparent brain damage. During this time, Greer continued as the Cat and pursued a very brief career under the alias as a crime-fighter, operating mostly within the Chicago area.{{r|The Cat Vol 1 1|4}}

Following the Man-Killer after her assassination of the Mayor of Chicago, Greer barely survived their inaugural encounter, and ventured to New York hot on her trail.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 1 8}} As most men would dismiss her, Greer had a short "spar" with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] over the city to prove her ability. After informing Spider-Man of her mission, he gladly joined her, and the pair ventured to Harlem to stop Man-Killer's attack on a power plant, but lost sight of her after immobilizing her compatriots. When plant manager Watkins informs the heroes that Man-Killer escaped with radioactive materials, Spider-Man intercepted her, and following a short skirmish, The Cat informed Man-Killer that her exo-suit was designed by men from A.I.M. which causes the villain to go into a rage, then a mindless state upon the realization.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 1 8}}

===Becoming Tigra===
Unbeknownst to Greer, Tumolo was a member of the [[Cat People (Demons)|Cat People]], a race of humanoids magically evolved from cats in Europe during the Middle Ages. Prior to the explosion, Donalbain had engineered, Tumolo had become aware of a Hydra plot to steal an ancient bacterial culture developed by Tumolo's ancestors: The Black Death. Hydra had discovered Tumolo's secret ancestry and suspected her of possessing the formula for "The Final Secret," but Tumolo had feigned brain damage to evade them, but they abducted her from her private home during her 'recovery'. Greer put on her Cat costume and pursued them. Hydra agents fled from the Cat's attack, but during the confrontation managed to shoot her with "alpha radiation." To save Greer's life, Tumolo and the Cat People mystically transformed her into the legendary half-human, half-cat warrior they called the Tigra. As Tigra, Greer helped the Cat People defeat the Hydra agents.{{r|Giant-Size Creatures Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Greer Grant (Earth-616) from West Coast Avengers Vol 2 14 0001.jpg|180px|thumb|left]]
Although she was able to use the [[Cat's Head Amulet|Cat's Head amulet]] to change back to her human form, Greer became so accustomed to and enamored of her feline form that she seldom made the transformation. Moving from Chicago, she became a full-time adventurer, encountering and defeating such menaces as the [[Rat Pack (Saboteurs) (Earth-616)|Rat Pack]] led by the [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]] in his human guise as Joshua Plague,{{r|Marvel Chillers Vol 1 3}}{{r|{{cl|Marvel Chillers Vol 1 5}}-[[Marvel Chillers Vol 1 7|7]]}} [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]],{{r|Marvel Chillers Vol 1 4}} and Tabur. She also briefly worked with Red Wolf,{{r|Marvel Chillers Vol 1 6|7}} the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]],{{r|Marvel Two-In-One Vol 1 19}} Spider-Man, and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 177}} When back in Chicago, she was pursuing Kraven but was caught in his trap for her. She was made into his pet to fight Spider-Man, but the wall-crawler instead freed her from the mind-control collar, allowing the duo to best Kraven in his own hunting grounds.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 1 125}}

===The Avengers===
Tigra was among the handful of costumed crime-fighters that the telepath [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]] coerced into vying for [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] membership.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 211}} She was elected to membership and served for several months, all that time doubting she was worthy of membership in the group. Although she proved herself while in battle with the Molecule Man, she decided to resign her active membership.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 216}} Moving to San Francisco, she became friends with [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Jessica Drew]], the original Spider-Woman, and even aided Jessica's resurrection when she had become a ghost detached from her body by a plan by [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 240}} Once Doctor Strange was called in, The Avengers battled Morgan, buying time for Jessica to reunite with her body and return to life.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 241}}

===West Coast Avengers===
Months later, when [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] moved to Los Angeles to form a West Coast branch of the Avengers, she was invited to join.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 1 1}} She made a staunch addition to the team, despite the fact that the human and feline sides of her personality had become at odds with one another, causing her behavior to become somewhat erratic. Because of her catlike need for attention, she became involved with teammates [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]] and [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] at the same time. The ultimate solution to her discordant nature presented itself when she and the Avengers journeyed to the "Land Within," the magical dimension where the parent tribe of the Cat People lived. The ruler of the Cat People offered to magically cure her of her split personality if she would kill [[Martin Preston (Earth-616)|Master Pandemonium]], a demonic human being whom the Cat People feared and hated. Although Tigra agreed, she could not bring herself to violate the Avengers' code against killing when she had the opportunity to do so.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 9}}
[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 794 Avengers Variant Textless.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Wackos 4-ever]]

After almost killing Hawkeye in a training exercise, Greer decided to abandon her Tigra form permanently. Almost immediately, Hank Pym and Greer were kidnapped on behalf of the demon Allatou, who wrongly believed them to be agents of her enemy, Master Pandemonium. The Avengers sought aid from [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Hellstorm]] and [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]], who were retired heroes at the time, having set up an occult investigations business. Together, the heroes invaded Allatou's realm with Pandemonium on their heels. A three-way fight broke out until Allatou managed to strand everyone with Pandemonium aboard a boat running through the various realms of Hell.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 14}}

Shortly after, the castaways found that they had drifted into the Cat People's Land Within. It turned out the Cat People were demons, having become such through their longtime residence in the demonic realms. The Cat People were at the time guarding a shard of Pandemonium's soul on behalf of the demon Mephisto, and they had ordered Tigra to kill Pandemonium to protect it. Tigra continued to refuse to slay Pandemonium, and the Cat People punished her by stripping away her cat-soul altogether and leaving her human. Hellcat, however, owning a version of Greer's original Cat costume, gave it to Greer, who led the Avengers in battling the Cat-People and single-handedly defeated their champion, the Balkatar. The cat-soul was released from confinement in the struggle, and stronger than ever, re-inhabited Greer again, producing a Tigra that was more physically formidable than ever but controlled by Greer's human intellect. The Cat People surrendered, unwilling to battle a "whole" Tigra, who now exactly resembled the revered Tigra of their legends. Returning with the Avengers, Tigra continued as an active member and forsook her previous romantic involvement with others of her team.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 15}}

[[File:Marc Spector (Earth-616) and Greer Grant (Earth-616) from West Coast Avengers Vol 2 27 001.jpg|250px|thumb|left]]
However, she soon started another romance with the new recruit [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Marc Spector]], the Moon Knight.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 27}} The Avengers were rocked by controversy when their member Mockingbird revealed that she let the villainous Phantom Rider die in a previous encounter. Sympathetic to Mockingbird's cause, Tigra joined Moon Knight in briefly splitting from the team to accompany Mockingbird, who quit the team and separated from her husband and leader, Hawkeye.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 37}}

Together, the trio joined Bill Foster (previously Giant-Man) to stop the villainous [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]], and later fought the [[Night Shift (Earth-616)|Night Shift]]. Afterwards, the heroes sought help from Hellstorm and Hellcat to rid Mockingbird of the ghost of the Phantom Rider. The three parted ways after this, and Tigra returned to the Avengers.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 41}} Over time, however, Tigra's cat-soul continued to reassert itself. As it gained more and more prominence, Tigra once again became moody and aggressive, but also began to change physically to resemble that of a predatory cat, and was even discovered to be chasing mice. On a subsequent adventure, Pym was forced to used his size-altering powers to shrink Tigra to the size of a house cat, which she resembled. He imprisoned her until he could discover a cure.{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 2 49}}

Shortly afterward, the time-traveler Immortus freed Tigra to further distract the Avengers from his plans against them, and Tigra roamed the city for some time. The sorceress Agatha Harkness, who at the time was living at the Avengers' compound, discovered and re-captured her. Seeking a cure for Tigra's condition, Harkness called upon the Cat People. The Cat People's new ruler — Tigra's old foe Tabur, a cat artificially evolved into humanoid feline form — appeared and restored Tigra to humanoid form. Tabur tried to coerce her into mating with him to legitimize his usurpation of the Cat People's throne, but Tigra resisted and Harkness mystically transplanted Tigra's cat-soul into Tabur, causing him to revert to the form of a mere cat while allowing Tigra to keep her superhuman form but retain her human personality. Using Tabur's discarded amulet, Greer was even able to switch from Tigra form to ordinary human form and back again whenever she wished. Thus empowered again, Tigra rejoined the Avengers' West Coast branch.{{r|Avengers Spotlight Vol 1 38}}{{r|Avengers: West Coast Vol 1 66}}

Later, on a mission against their enemies, the Pacific Overlords, Tigra was forced to crash-land the Avengers' Quinjet in an Australian wilderness, but was rescued by Native Australians. She elected to stay with her rescuers, taking a leave of absence from the team.{{r|Avengers: West Coast Vol 1 74}} She did, however, assist a team of reserve Avengers when the main team was off-planet, fighting amid the Kree-Shi'ar War.{{r|Avengers: West Coast Vol 1 83}} Afterwards, she apparently remained in the United States, and was on hand to attend the funeral of Mockingbird.{{r|Avengers: West Coast Vol 1 100}} Electing not to stay with the newly re-formed Avengers, Tigra left with [[Eros (Earth-616)|Starfox]] for outer space, searching for hedonistic off-planet adventures.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 4}} Tigra grew quickly disenfranchised with such a lifestyle, and was relieved when former teammate [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]] assembled Tigra, Starfox, and other Avengers to battle the alien Infinites. When the crisis was averted, Tigra returned to Earth.{{r|Avengers: Infinity Vol 1 1}}

After splitting from the Avengers, Tigra needed finances and got a job as a spokeswoman for a fast food chain, but her employer also hired Spider-Man due to his better "recognition" in the media. While initially offended, Spider-Man exited so Tigra could be the focus. After the commercial, she went on a date with a NYPD beat cop, Carl Kronsky, who reminded her of her deceased husband Will. She was later attacked by a returned Zabo, Donalbain's brother and henchman, but while Spider-Man and Carl were busy "helping" Tigra, she attempted to talk with him. Knocked down, Tigra had Spider-Man hold off the NYPD from attacking as she convinced Zabo to leave and start a new life for himself.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 1 125}}

===Becoming a Police Officer===
Having attempted to settle into a new life over the past few years with the Avengers, Tigra wasn't happy with just being "part of the team". She realized she had to settle up with the past, and this meant uncovering The Brotherhood of the Blue Fist: an elusive group of police who might have murdered her late husband, Will Nelson. Working undercover as "Greer Sorenson" a Police Cadet, she signed up for training at the New York City Police Academy. She rooted out the conspirators and the organization was dismantled. After finishing her assignment, Greer finished her Police training and undertook a new career in the police force, in part from inspiration from her memory of Will.{{r|Tigra Vol 1 4}}

===Initiative===
[[File:Avengers The Initiative Vol 1 27 70th Frame Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|180px]]
Tigra fought on Iron Man's side during the Civil War, fully supporting Stark's Registration Act, although she expressed concern about the fate of Captain America and the other heroes who opposed the Act and turned fugitive. Nonetheless, Tigra registered to comply with the law and also, as having become an agent of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], to actively aid in its enforcement. Pretending to switch allegiances, she successfully infiltrated Captain America's Secret Avengers team as a mole and passed information to Iron Man for more than a week before being outed by [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]], thanks to his enhanced senses. Captain America exploited her presence to feed disinformation to Iron Man about his team's strategy for the final push later that day.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 6}}{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 24}}

She again believed she had become involved in a romantic relationship with fellow superhero [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]], however, at the climax of the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], she discovered her relationship was not with the true Hank Pym, but rather with his Skrull replacement [[Criti Noll (Clone) (Earth-616)|Criti Noll]]. Greer became pregnant with the imposter's child, thus making her a target of Norman Osborn's, who wanted to obtain the baby.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 20}}

===Rotating teams===
After the fall of [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]], [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]] founded the Avengers Academy and had Tigra join as a teacher, along with [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]], [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Speedball]], and [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]].{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 1}} Having Hank Pym inspect her baby, Hank Pym let Tigra know that he had no traces of Skrull DNA, figuring that the Skrull impostor who was him had copied him down to the genetic level. Tigra asked Hank to father him if something were to happen to her.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 7}}

Tigra was one of ten female heroes recruited by Misty Knight to aid her and Valkyrie in repelling a group of Asgardian Doom Maidens. At the end of this adventure, Valkyrie came to realize that Tigra and three of the other heroines were among those deemed by the All-Mother to be worthy to become shieldmaidens like herself, symbols of honor, valor and courage, to one day be led by Valkyrie into battle and death.{{r|Fearless Defenders Vol 1 6}}

===Secret Empire and Aftermath===
With [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] in command of the United States, Tigra joined the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]] resistance movement and aided in security with her sensory abilities to detect any approaching forces.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} In the final push to destroy Hydra's leadership, Tigra joined all of her fellow heroes and attacked the stronghold housing [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Supreme Leader Steve Rogers]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}}
[[File:Greer Grant (Earth-616) from Secret Empire Vol 1 1 001.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Part of the Underground]]

Afterwards, Tigra accompanied a small troupe of Avengers and New York heroes who located and challenged [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Frank Castle]] for his part in Hydra's rule, as well as his theft of the War Machine armor. When going for his head, Tigra was repelled with a repulsor to her face before Castle’s retreat. Tigra and the other heroes pursued Castle across the tri-state area, but repeatedly came to dead end leads having just missed Castle.{{r|Punisher Vol 2 225}}

===West Coast Avengers Reformed===
Tigra was made into a 200 foot tall rampaging monster by [[M.O.D.O.K. Superior (Earth-616)|B.R.O.D.O.K.]] (actually M.O.D.O.K.) in his mission to find love that ended with him turning all the women who rejected him into giant monsters.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 1|2}} After realizing the new West Coast Avengers weren't really his friends, B.R.O.D.O.K. ordered the giant women to destroy Los Angeles. At the start of the rampage, [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Kid Omega]] knocked Tigra out and undid the mind control, leaving her in a furious state, but gaining a new ally.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 3}} With M.O.D.O.K. defeated and flung from Los Angeles, Tigra helped subdue the monster women to then be reverted to their original selves. When reverted to her original size, she thanked Barton for helping her, and was glad that she could hunt down M.O.D.O.K. herself. She declined Barton's invitation to the new roster, but wished the "adorable" new team her best.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 4}}

===Gwenpool Strikes Back===
Under the guise of a "Dying Wish" charity event, Tigra was invited to a remote deserted island with fellow Avengers members, as well as her street level friends, for a swimsuit competition. Using her original bikini attire, Tigra was among the many heroes to hear Gwenpool's plan to be taken seriously, as she pitted the heroes in a 1v1 battle royal, with losers sent to a V.I.P. audience box to see the rest happen. Tigra, like everyone else, was at first amused and dismissive, but then shocked as Gwen showed her severity upon revealing Bruce Banner in a cage. As Gwen finished her speech on a "friendly demonstration," the young 'host' shot and killed Banner to trigger the matches, summoning the Immortal Hulk. Tigra's starting match up was with T'Challa, who defeated her after a duration, leaving her in the safety of the V.I.P. box.{{r|Gwenpool Strikes Back #3}} After Gwen defeated Hulk, Tigra and the other heroes were trapped in the box with him, all working to contain him.{{r|Gwenpool Strikes Back #4}} Once Hulk was contained, Tigra was among the heroes who was furious with Gwenpool for her stunt, and stood unamused as Gwen made an exit.{{r|Gwenpool Strikes Back #5}}

===Nadia's Extended Family===
Arriving for Nadia's birthday with her family and friends, Greer introduced herself and her son William - who preceded her greeting by pouncing on Nadia. When Viv was about to speak about the Skrull-Hank technicality of his parentage, Greer interrupted to note how much Hank loved his son; and to then quietly warn/threaten Viv about keeping that fact a secret. After Viv complied and Greer helped Nadia up, she wanted to introduce William as Nadia's birthday gift, as half-siblings. With Nadia's jubilation at having a little brother, Greer was tearfully happy that Nadia would be a part of William's life.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 2 7}} Greer later assisted in helping Nadia subdue Monica Rappaccini, after the latter's failed attempt to conscript young scientists for A.I.M. at Nadia's Expo.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 2 10}}
