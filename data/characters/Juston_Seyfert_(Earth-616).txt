===Origin===
Juston Seyfert was raised along with his younger brother [[Christopher Seyfert (Earth-616)|Chris]] by his father, [[Peter Seyfert (Earth-616)|Pete]], in [[Antigo]], [[Wisconsin (State)|Wisconsin]]. His [[Jen Baker (Earth-616)|mother]] left their family when he was still very young because she tired of domestic life and responsibility. The Seyfert family lived in a junkyard [[Seyfert Salvage]]. Juston and Chris had a very close relationship, and frequently worked together to built battlebots. Unfortunately, Juston and his friends [[Character Index/M#Matt|Matt]] and [[Alex Anderson (Earth-616)|Alex]], small for their age, were often picked on at [[Antigo Senior High|school]].{{r|Sentinel #1}}

[[File:Juston Seyfert (Earth-616) meets Sentinel (Juston) (Earth-616) from Sentinel Vol 1 2 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Juston first meets his Sentinel]]
===Sentinel===
When Juston discovered a control chip, he didn't realize how important the discovery really was and inadvertently activated the self-repair mode of a deactivated [[Sentinel (Juston) (Earth-616)|Sentinel]].{{r|Sentinel #1}} After discovering the semi-operational Sentinel, Juston began helping to rebuild and reprogram him.{{r|Sentinel #1|5}} 

Juston's first major use of the Sentinel was to scare [[Character Index/G#Greg|Greg]] and [[Josh Arndt (Earth-616)|Josh]], two bully-jocks who had been tormenting him and his friends. It worked, and Juston appeared to be a hero for scaring off the Sentinel.{{r|Sentinel #6}} However, almost immediately after, Juston began to feel guilty for his ill-gotten fame. To redeem himself he began going out at night with the Sentinel to do some good including rescuing a truck driver from an accident{{r|Sentinel #7}} and rescuing four survivors of a lane crash.{{r|Sentinel #8|9}} Juston Sentinel was eventually caught by the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities (Earth-616)|Commission on Superhuman Activities]], partially fearing being implicated and partially wanting to find his mother, Juston stole the Sentinel and ran away.{{r|Sentinel #12}}{{r|Sentinel Vol 2 #1}}

Fearing that the reemergence of the Sentinel would lead to evidence of their assassination conspiracy, [[Archibald Hunt (Earth-616)|Colonel Hunt]] and [[Jeff Knudsen (Earth-616)|Senator Knudesen]] decided to use a prototype [[Sentinel Mk VII-A]] to destroy the Sentinel and kill Juston.{{r|{{cl|Sentinel Vol 2 1}}-[[Sentinel Vol 2 5|5]]}} Juston was not able to find his mother, but he was able to escape Hunt's Stealth Sentinel, rescue his family, and blackmail Hunt and Knudsen into leaving them alone. After the their final battle, Juston used parts from the deactivated Sentinel Mk VII-A to repair and enhance his Sentinel.{{r|Sentinel Vol 2 #5}}

===Avengers Academy===
After knowledge of Juston's Sentinel became public, everyone freaked out. To keep his Sentinel, Juston joined the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]] which had just expanded it's enrollment, and relocated to the [[Avengers Compound]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California (State)|California]].{{r|Avengers Academy #21}} Despite his father's protest, Juston chose to remain with the Avengers Academy.{{r|Avengers Academy #33}}{{r|Avengers Arena #13}}

[[File:Avengers Academy (Earth-616) from Avengera Academy Vol 1 33 0004.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] and [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Giant-Man]] rebuilding Juston's Sentinel]]
Juston continued to retool and modify his Sentinel, although it's presences at caused some issues with mutants at the Avengers Compound,{{r|Avengers Academy #22}}{{r|Avengers Academy #27}}{{r|Avengers Academy #29|31}}{{r|Avengers Academy #32|33}} and despite his best efforts, Juston was unable to remove the "Destroy All Mutants" programming. Juston was able to add new directives that contradicted this original programming and set the "Destroy All Mutants" program as it's least important directive.{{r|Avengers Academy #32}}

When the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] imbued five [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] with its cosmic powers,{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #5}} the [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]] set out to reframe the world to their liking including the destruction of all Sentinels.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #5}} [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] personally came to the Avengers Compound to destroy Juston's Sentinel.{{r|Avengers Academy #32}} Juston and the other students protested, and in the end Juston's Sentinel sacrificed itself to safe Juston from Emma. Luckily, [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksliver]] was able to obtain the Sentinel's central processing unit before Emma destroyed it, but the Sentinel was able to be rebuilt.{{r|Avengers Academy #33}}

===Avengers Arena===
Juston and his Sentinel are among the sixteen young superheroes kidnapped by [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] to battle to the death in his new [[Murderworld]].{{r|Avengers Arena #1}} To prevent suspicion, Arcade sends a humanoid robot to live with his family in [[Antigo]].{{r|Avengers Arena #13}}

[[File:Juston Seyfert (Earth-616) and Katy & Timothy Bashir (Earth-616) from Avengers Arena Vol 1 9 0001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Katy Bashir (Earth-616)|Apex]] murdering Juston]]
Originally, Juston journeys out with his classmates [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]], [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat]], and [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-616)|Reptil]].{{r|Avengers Arena #1|3}} Unfortunately, it isn't long before Juston and his Sentinel are attacked by [[Katy Bashir (Earth-616)|Apex]].{{r|Avengers Arena #3}} During the struggle, Juston is paralyzed, the Sentinel destroyed, and Juston is left for dead among the Sentinel wreckage in the desert.{{r|Avengers Arena #3}}{{r|Avengers Arena #8}}

Fortunately, Juston survives, and driven by revenge he rebuilds the Sentinel as a pilot operated fighting machine. Bent on revenge, Juston tries to kill Apex, but is stopped by [[Timothy Bashir (Earth-616)|Tim Bashir]].{{r|Avengers Arena #8}} It isn't long however until Apex regains control of her shared body, snaps Juston's neck, and leaves with his Sentinel, [[Rebecca Ryker (Earth-616)|Death Locket]], and [[Chase Stein (Earth-616)|Chasehawk]].{{r|Avengers Arena #9|10}} What remained of the Sentinel is finally destroyed by [[Nico Minoru (Earth-616)|Nico]] with her [[Staff of One]] during her final battle with Apex.{{r|Avengers Arena #12}}
