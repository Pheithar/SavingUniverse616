===Early Life===
[[Nathaniel Richards (Earth-616)|Nathaniel Richards]] ended up stranded in the alternate future of [[Earth-6311]] after using one of his transportation devices.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 5}} He fell in love with a woman [[Cassandra Richards (Earth-6311)|Cassandra]], and they had a child named Tara.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 5}} Tara and Franklin were taken to [[Kargul (Earth-6311)|Warlord Kargul]] for training.{{r|Fantastic Four #390}} Tara became Huntara and Franklin became the Psi-Lord. After Nathaniel left, Huntara became guardian of the timestream. Due to Kargul, she began to think of her father as a traitor to the timeline.{{r|Fantastic Force #1}}

===Fearsome Foursome===
When [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Johnny Storm]] went to trial for setting fire to [[Empire State University]], he was attacked in the courtroom by [[Paibok (Earth-616)|Paibok]] and [[Devos (Earth-616)|Devos]]. Simultaneously, Klaw attempted to have his revenge upon the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]. Upon arriving on [[Earth-616]], Huntara was approached by [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Klaw]] and joined his [[Fearsome Foursome (Earth-616)|Fearsome Foursome]]. Working together, they attacked the FF.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 377}} However the Fantastic Four at that time consisted of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]], [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]], and [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]]. The Fearsome Foursome were winning the battle but then the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] arrived, so they decided to retreat through a portal opened by Huntara. Daredevil attempted to pursue, but the dimension in which he found himself confused his senses, and he had to be pulled out by Spider-Man.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 378}} On Paibok's starship they planned to destroy the FF at [[Four Freedoms Plaza]], where they lay in wait for the Fantastic Four's return. When the heroes returned, Huntara launched into battle with [[Franklin Richards (Earth-6311)|Psi-Lord]], leading the two of them away from the others. The remaining members of the Fantastic Four were taken out by knock-out gas delivered by Devos and Paibok. The two allies then teleported their captives to Paibok's ship, so that they could turn them over to the [[Skrull Empire]]. After they had disappeared, Klaw came out of hiding, and soon took the unconscious body of [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] prisoner.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 382}}

===Dark Raider===
She disassociated herself from Franklin when he sided with his grandfather. Franklin was convinced the [[Reed Richards (Earth-944)|Dark Raider]] was the real culprit, and challenged Kargul's explanation that it was Nathaniel.{{r|Fantastic Four #390}} When Kargul's forces attacked Franklin, Tara sided with her nephew. They returned to [[Earth-616]].{{r|Fantastic Four #392}}

===Fantastic Force=== 
When the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] was disbanded after the death of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]] and [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], Huntara and Psi-Lord decided to form a team of their own known as the [[Fantastic Force (Earth-616)|Fantastic Force]] with [[Devlor (Earth-616)|Devlor]], an [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] with the ability to become a giant ape-like creature and [[N'Kano (Earth-616)|Vibraxas]] from [[Wakanda]] who could manipulate sound waves. One of their first battles was against [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Klaw]].{{r|Fantastic Force #1}}

They next battled [[Zarathustra (Earth-616)|Zarathustra]] who was raised from childhood to be an assassin for [[Lord Moses (Earth-616)|Lord Moses]]. [[Paul Alvarez (Earth-616)|Paul Alvarez]] believed that Huntara was his long lost sister Mary Elizabeth Alvarez, who he saw walk into a portal with a mysterious man back when they were children. Huntara was raised by [[Kargul (Earth-6311)|Warlord Kargul]] in another timeline so the theory seemed somewhat plausible. But it was strongly hinted that Paul Alvarez was wrong and that Zarathustra was really Mary Elizabeth Alvarez.{{r|Fantastic Force #2}}

The Inhuman [[Uys (Earth-616)|Seeker]] tried to apprehend Devlor but determined that he was "the one" and chose to file a report saying Devlor was dead. Devlor mentioned that the Seeker must know what it was like being a freak.{{r|Fantastic Force #3}}

They next battled [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] as well as the [[Super-Adaptoid (Earth-616)|Super-Adaptoid]],{{r|Fantastic Force #4}} and after that battle the group faced off with [[Dreadface (Earth-616)|Dreadface]].{{r|Fantastic Force #5}} They also went up against [[Paul Duval (Earth-616)|Grey Gargoyle]].{{r|Fantastic Force #6}}

They teamed up with the [[Secret Defenders (Earth-616)|Secret Defenders]] to battle [[Slorioth (Earth-616)|Slorioth]].{{r|Secret Defenders #25}}

Being very angry with her father, Huntara attacked Nathaniel Richards. However, Franklin Richards soon reminded her that he was the leader of the Fantastic Force, and thereby ordered her to stop her attack so they could hear what his grandfather had to say. Nathaniel explained that Franklin's mother and teammates were about to stand up to a Rogue Watcher and an even greater menace. [[Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)|Kristoff Vernard]] then informed everyone present that [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Susan Storm-Richards]] was in peril and that he and the Fantastic Four had been unable to find a means to rescue her. Huntara immediately left the group and transported to the [[Negative Zone]]. There she saved Susan Storm from certain death in the Negative Zone's Explosive Area.{{r|Fantastic Force #7}} 

They then battled the [[Genetic Council (Earth-616)|Inhuman Genetic Council]].{{r|Fantastic Force #8}} [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] temporarily joined the team to battle Lord Moses.{{r|Fantastic Force #9|10}} 

The team battled [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]] in [[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantis]].{{r|Fantastic Four: Atlantis Rising #2}}

They battled [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-721)|Vangaard (Johnny Storm)]] from an alternate future of [[Earth-721]]. They were assisted in battle by the Human Torch and Black Panther.{{r|Fantastic Force #11}} Johnny, through his heroic actions, caused Vangaard to remember his old life as a hero and decided to end his assault.{{r|Fantastic Force #12}}

Huntara later left the team and was replaced by [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] who helped battle the [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]].{{r|Fantastic Force #13}} On a trip to Wakanda, they battled the Sons of Sinanju{{r|Fantastic Force #14}} and the [[Mena Ngai|Mound monster]].{{r|Fantastic Force #15}} 

[[Esteban Coraz√≥n de Ablo (Earth-616)|Diablo]] also attempted to manipulate Psi-Lord into helping him defeat [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] but this only ended with his defeat.{{r|Fantastic Force #16}} The team met its end with the return of Reed and the de-aging of Franklin back to a minor, which was all caused by his future son [[Jonathan Richards (Earth-967)|Hyperstorm]].{{r|Fantastic Force #17}} It was revealed that much of what Nathaniel had taught Franklin was in an attempt to alter the timeline so that Hyperstorm would not exist.{{r|Fantastic Force #18}}

===[[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]]===
After the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], she was listed as a potential recruit for the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]].{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = '''Psionic Scythe''': Huntara has the psionic ability to generate a scythe. The scythe can damage foes mentally and can form teleportational rifts. As well as being able to redistribute force amongst it being so it becomes unbreakable, as it did when Vibraxas tried to use his vibrational powers on it.{{r|Fantastic Force Vol 1 3}}
