| History                 = The Great Game was a competition between uber-rich rivals called Sponsors who used super-powered or armored representatives, called Players, to fight for them in Matches. Matches could vary from one-on-one combat between Players to more complicated criminal acts, thefts, retrievals, or conflicts with non-players. Sponsors (participating or otherwise) could wager on the outcome of a given Match. Referees spotted Players in the field during a Match through a complicated scoring process, and Players could win bonuses and prizes based on their success during matches.
