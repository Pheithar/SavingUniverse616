| History                 = S.P.E.A.R. was a Chinese intelligence gathering organization created for homeland security. It possessed over 150,000 operatives, analysts, and overseers, sixteen airships, and a science division. Commanded by director [[Xian Zheng (Earth-616)|Xian Zheng]], the organization was built after the [[Infinity (Event)|invasion]] by [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]],{{r|Avengers World #7}} in which the super-powered team [[Dynasty (Earth-616)|Dynasty]] was decimated,{{r|Avengers World #13}} Feeling that they needed to be able to protect themselves, [[China]] wanted to be on the same level as [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. So they appointed Zheng to head up the new project.

[[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] first encountered them during Gorgon's attempt to launch an attack on [[China]] using a giant dragon. When the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] attacked their flying headquarters, the [[Circle (S.P.E.A.R.)|Circle]], they deployed their own dedicated superhuman response team, the [[Ascendants (Earth-616)|Ascendants]].{{r|Avengers World #7}}
