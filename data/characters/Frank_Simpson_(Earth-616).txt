===Early life===
Frank Simpson was the disturbed son of a wealthy, abusive, alcoholic, upper-class woman in [[Ohio (State)|Ohio]]. Frank soon developed an unhealthy affection for his babysitter, the only real maternal figure in his life. The young woman, who was harboring feelings for his father Charles, capitalized on Frank's affection and talked the boy into killing his mother. [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], whom at that time was an operative for the ruthless organization [[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X]], had been sent to kidnap Frank. Logan showed up, dressed as a police officer. He then stalked Charles Simpson and the babysitter; eventually shooting the girl with Charles' gun, after which Charles committed suicide. Wolverine then went to Frank's place and abducted him for [[Project Homegrown (Earth-616)|Project: Homegrown]].{{r|Wolverine: Origins #3}}

===Vietnam War===
Years later, Frank was sent into the [[Vietnam War]] as a black-ops agent. Captured by the Viet Cong, Frank was severely tortured by Logan (who was posing as a Russian intelligence liaison), shattering Frank's still unbalanced mind. While torturing Nuke (even carving into his face the American flag that years later would become part of his super-powered personality) Logan implanted the phrase "No V.C.!" as a trigger word, along with the compulsion to kill gruesomely, in retaliation for the tortures suffered, anyone who uttered the words. He then allowed Frank to escape, testing his work with a village of peasants, who, seeing an American soldier, tried to soothe his anger and convince him to spare them, shouting the "No V.C.!" phrase, meaning that they weren't Viet Cong. Frank, in response to the trigger word, burnt the village to the ground killing every inhabitant. The experiment being a success, Logan was instated as the handler of the human weapon. Due to his trauma, Nuke often hallucinates that the enemies he is fighting are the Viet Cong.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 18}}{{r|Wolverine: Origins #2}}

===Project Homegrown===
[[File:Frank Simpson (Earth-616) from Daredevil Vol 1 233 001.png|left|thumb|[[Adrenaline Pills]].]]
At some time during the war, Nuke was then inducted into the final part of the Project Homegrown, the [[Weapon VII]] program, part of the [[Weapon Plus]] program, the super-soldier program that would later transform Wolverine into a killing machine. They turned him into a partial cyborg with a sub-dermal mesh able to deflect bullets, and a second heart that, working in conjunction with some [[Adrenaline Pills]], controlled his aggression, leaving him addicted as well. His whereabouts after the war are still unknown.{{r|New X-Men #145}}{{r|Wolverine: Origins #39}}

===Daredevil===
Nuke resurfaced, employed by Generalissimo [[Felix Guillermo Caridad (Earth-616)|Felix Guillermo Caridad]], of [[Tierra Verde]], to destroy a rebel base. Caridad was impressed with his skills, and he enjoyed using Nuke periodically as a superhuman iconic symbol.{{r|Daredevil #232}} [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] hired Nuke through several corrupt military officials and sent him to kill [[Matthew Murdoch (Earth-616)|Daredevil]]. Nuke went on a rampage in [[New York City]], blowing up part of [[Hell's Kitchen]], causing Daredevil and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] to capture him. He escaped soon after, going for Daredevil again, but was intercepted by Captain America and shot by a military chopper. Apparently dead, he was in fact taken in care by the Government, still controlled by the Tierra Verde enclave.{{r|Daredevil #233}}{{r|Web of Spider-Man #30}}

===Origins Events===
After Wolverine discovered his full past and set out to take care of loose ends, the U.S. government dispatched Nuke, who was kept at the United States embassy in [[Chile]], to hunt down Wolverine.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #1|2}}

Wolverine, with some efforts, quickly dispatched his foe, seeking a way to redeem, or kill him. After the battle he discovered that Nuke's enhanced physiology was further mutated, and he has become a cyborg, with artificial limbs, bones and skull, able to survive and being rebuilt after the most gruesome injuries, yet devoid of any personality or conscience.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #3}}

[[File:Thunderbolts Vol 1 131 Variant Clint Langley.jpg|thumb|right|Frank as Scourge]]
Acknowledging that now he was beyond any hope of redemption, he tried to kill him, only to be stopped by Captain America, who had arrived because he believed that Nuke was a failed subject of the Super Soldier Program.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #4}} Now without any legs, the leftovers of Nuke's body were handed over to [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] by Wolverine, who wanted Emma to try to restore Nuke's broken mind if possible. Logan also told Emma Frost that should restoring Nuke's mind be impossible, she was to call Logan so that he could come back to kill Nuke.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #5}}

[[File:Thunderbolts Vol 1 138 Textless.jpg|left|thumb]]
===Thunderbolts===
[[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] added a man named Scourge to his black ops team the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]]; Osborn seemed to know who Scourge was, but did not reveal Scourge's identity.{{r|Thunderbolts #133}} On their next mission, Osborn ordered Yelena Belova to lead the current Thunderbolts to kill former Thunderbolt, [[Melissa Gold (Earth-616)|Songbird]]. During the mission, Osborn promoted Scourge to field leader, and Belova was revealed to be the original [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], Natasha Romanova in disguise.{{r|Thunderbolts #134}} Scourge led the team into capturing the Black Widow, Songbird,{{r|Thunderbolts #135}} and [[Nick Fury]]{{r|Secret Warriors #7}}{{r|Secret Warriors #8}} {{r|Captain America: Reborn #3}} When Scourge ordered the Thunderbolts to execute Songbird, [[Headsman (Earth-616)|Headsman]] turned on him and tried to kill him. [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]] helped out by shooting Scourge, and [[Ghost (Earth-616)|Ghost]] used an electroconvulsive shock to make Scourge forget what happened as Songbird and the Black Widow escaped. When Osborn confronted Scourge about the botched mission, the man revealed himself to be Nuke, stating that his new name was not who he really was; Osborn then demoted Nuke from the position of team leader.{{r|Thunderbolts #136}} He was then assigned to assassinate the [[Agents of Atlas (Earth-616)|Agents of Atlas]] with the Thunderbolts.

[[File:Thunderbolts Vol 1 139 Textless.jpg|right|thumb]]
When the Agents of Atlas arrived, he and the Thunderbolts attacked them. While [[Venus (Siren) (Earth-616)|Venus]] was singing, he had hallucinations about women he killed and fired his gun wildly at her. He was then taken down by [[Aquaria Neptunia (Earth-616)|Namora]]. After he came to, he picked up a sword and sliced [[Robert Grayson (Earth-616)|Bob Grayson]]'s stomach open and was then attacked by [[Kenneth Hale (Earth-616)|Ken Hale]].{{r|Thunderbolts #137}} When Venus realized Bob was dead, she started crying, causing a more negative effect than her singing, and he saw a world with no more war. Bob then revealed that he was not dead but projecting a mental illusion while investigating Frank's mind. As the Agents of Atlas escaped, [[James Woo (Earth-616)|Jimmy Woo]] and Bob planted a command in Frank's mind to assassinate Norman Osborn on contact. When the Thunderbolts returned to base, Norman left a recorded message for the team, and seeing Norman's face, Frank pulled out his gun and fired, killing Cleavon Twain.{{r|Thunderbolts #138}} The team battled [[Spider-Woman]].{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 4 4}}

===Siege===
[[File:Thunderbolts Vol 1 137 page 27 Frank Simpson (Earth-616).jpg|right|thumb|Vs. Luke Cage]]
During Siege, Nuke and the Thunderbolts fought against the [[Mighty Avengers (Pym) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]].{{r|Mighty Avengers #36}} The Thunderbolts sought out the Spear of Odin to help Osborn storm Asgard. Nuke battled ferociously with US Agent for the Spear and after an intense battle, seriously injured and dismembered US Agent with the Spear.{{r|Thunderbolts #139}}

Before Nuke could bring the Spear to his "master", Osborn, he was betrayed and shot by his fellow Thunderbolt Paladin who took the spear from him and with the help of another Thunderbolt, in the shape of Ant-Man, made sure that Osborn didn't get his hands on the spear.{{r|Thunderbolts #140|145}}{{r|Thunderbolts #163.1}}

===The Heroic Age===
After the battle of Siege climaxed, a grievously injured Nuke was left in a coma and captured by authorities where he was taken to the Raft to receive medical treatment and serve out a sentence for his crimes. The surviving US Agent, who was now crippled, bitterly insisted that any attempt to bring him out of his coma was a waste of time as Nuke has no chance of ever reforming. Steve Rogers shared similar feelings and saw little reason to try and salvage Nuke, as he was far beyond saving, and any revival would likely just allow him to fall back into the hands of someone who would use him for further killing. Steve had also appeared to have made peace with his unease for being the basis of the creation of Nuke.{{r|Captain America Vol 7 #11}}

Most recently, Simpson had been spotted in Eastern Europe, still attacking individuals he perceived as enemies of America. He was allied and handled by the "Iron Nail" until Captain America urged him to stop his unnecessary violence.{{r|Captain America Vol 7 #12|15}} Taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, [[Horace Littleton (Earth-616)|Dr. Mindbubble]] ignited a massive explosion inside of Nuke's body which seemingly killed him.{{r|Captain America Vol 7 #17}}

===Hunting Wolverine===
Nuke was later shown alive, and part of a group of mercenaries who took a contract from [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]] to bring her the Wolverine alive. They confronted a bartender in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], he showed them a map which marked an island left by Wolverine for who came for him. He sent one of his men to the bay, which he knew was set to explode. Logan sank the boat from below and killed his men as they tried to swim, leaving only the two of them. Wolverine defeated Nuke by head-butting him with his Adamantium skull. Logan told him to spread the word that he was the last one he let live and forced him to tell him who put the bounty on him.{{r|Death of Wolverine #1}}

===Santo Marco===
Having returned to working for the United States government, Nuke was one of the numerous soldiers sent to assassinate the dictator of [[Santo Marco]], [[Emilio Duarte (Earth-616)|Emilio Duarte]]. He failed, and like many of his comrades, he was captured. After Duarte got hold of the technology to produce Nuke Pills, he used them as an incentive to have the soldiers he captured work for him. Simpson remained in custody,{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 12}} as he despised Duarte's actions and his use of the American flag in the [[Nuke Platoon (Earth-616)|Nuke Platoon]].{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 13}}

When Duarte had the Nuke Platoon exterminate mutants and mutant sympathizers, [[Weapon X-Force (Earth-616)|Weapon X]] traveled to Santo Marco to stop the slaughter. [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] stumbled upon Nuke's cell while he was being cornered by the Nuke Platoon at their supply factory.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 12}} Creed freed Simpson and gave him his pills to help him confront the soldiers. This move initially worked out until Nuke turned against Weapon X, since his schizophrenia made him believe they wanted to take the supply of pills from him. Nuke took the leadership role of the platoon and charged against the mutants.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 13}} Weapon X managed to hold off the Nuke Platoon by taking some of the pills for themselves. After [[James Howlett (Earth-21923)|Logan]] used explosives to detonate the remaining supply of pills, [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]] popped the contents of a calming capsule on Nuke's body through an open wound in his skin. Having regained focus, Nuke went on to finish his mission and assassinated President Duarte.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 14}}
