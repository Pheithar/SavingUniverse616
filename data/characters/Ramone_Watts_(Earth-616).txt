When her mother died when she was fifteen, Zobae left in a Wakandan Bureau her Dora Milaje inventory and left her children her Vibranium jewelry box, which complemented Johnny's powers when he came of age. However, one of the rings proved too painful for Ramone to use, so it was shelved until a situation was certain for needing it.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 9}}

With MODOK's unleashing Kaiju on San Francisco, Ramone demanded her brother make it home safely and was rescued by America Chavez. With the city saved soon after, America and Ramone started dating and formed some romantic interest, even sharing emotional resonance about their feelings with their parents.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 1|5}}

After Johnny and America were captured by the [[Masters of Evil West Coast (Earth-616)|The West Coast Masters]], Quire and Gwenpool went to Ramone for help. After she explained her origin, Ramone, uncertain of the outcome, asked Gwenpool to kill her should the activation fail, and wore the biotech Vibranium ring. After a successful activation, Ramone donned a living Vibranium exo-armor, which she used to aid the WCA in their rescue from a death trap of Californian vampire cultists and overcome the Masters. Back at Hawkeye investigations, America and Ramone upgrade their dating status and kiss for the documentary film crew, before America wrecked the camera.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 6|10}}
