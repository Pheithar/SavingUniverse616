| History                 = '''Eden Fesi''', alias '''Manifold''' was an indigenous Australian living in [[Kata Tjuta]], [[Australia]], under the tutelage of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] ally [[Gateway (Earth-616)|Gateway]]. Eden was selected as one of the many unregistered superhumans, hand picked by [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] as part of his [[Secret Warriors (Earth-616)|Secret Warriors]]. Initially, Fury attempted to recruit him to another unknown team, but Gateway refused. Hesitant at first, he agreed when Gateway gave his blessing for [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Quake]] to enroll him.{{r|Secret Warriors #4}}

[[File:Eden Fesi (Earth-616) from Secret Warriors Vol 1 6 0002.jpg|thumb|left]]
After joining the team Eden went on several successful missions with them. On a particular mission where his powers were key in the team's escape he was badly injured. The team barely made it out alive. The team disbanded, as [[James Taylor James (Earth-616)|Hellfire]] had betrayed them and Eden slipped into a coma.{{r|Secret Warriors #23}} Eden eventually made a full recovery.{{r|Secret Warriors #28}}

===Avengers===
Eden was recruited into the Avengers after the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|the conflict between Earth's Mightiest Heroes and the X-Men]]. Together with the other new recruits, he traveled to Mars to rescue the original team and fight [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 1}}

===Time Runs Out===
When the Avengers fell under S.H.I.E.L.D. authority, Manifold was one of the members who left and joined [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], now under the leadership of [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Bobby Da Costa]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}}

===The Final Incursion===
During the final [[Glossary:Incursion|incursion]], Manifold was part of the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati's]] evacuation plan, in their attempt to have humanity survive the end of everything. When the ship carrying the individuals the Illuminati had selected for survival was destroyed, Manifold channeled his powers through a machine that would help the Illuminati find the survivors that they "needed". Manifold succeeded in summoning all those needed, but burned himself out in the process, leading to his death.{{r|Secret Wars #1}}

===A Nation Under Our Feet===
Once the universe was destroyed,{{r|Secret Wars #1}} it ultimately came back.{{r|Secret Wars #9}} Manifold was restored back to life not remembering his sacrifice. He ended up in [[Wakanda]] where he assisted the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] in stopping the revolts within the country by teleporting T'Challa and his [[Hatut Zeraze (Earth-616)|Hatut Zeraze]] to strategic areas were the revolts were taking place.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 5}}

===The Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda===
[[file:Eden Fesi (Earth-616) from S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1 001.jpg|thumb|right]]
After T'Challa was contacted by the [[N'Jadaka (Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda) (Earth-616)|Emperor]] of the [[Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda]], he and Manifold went to meet him, but were instead captured and their memories were wiped.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 #18}} Manifold was made an enforcer for the empire and lead an army of [[Askari (Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda) (Earth-616)|Askari]] to fight the rebel group known as the [[Maroons (Earth-616)|Maroons]].{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 3|4}} However, Manifold managed to free himself from the empire's control and aided T'Challa and the Maroons against the empire.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 9|10}} They eventually returned to Wakanda on Earth, but the empire had been following them and waged war with their motherland. Manifold was among the individuals to help Wakanda in their war against the intergalactic empire.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 17|20}}

===S.W.O.R.D.===
Manifold later appeared as the leader of [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.'s]] mutant sub-team [[Six (Earth-616)|The Six]]. With the help of the Six, Manifold is able to transcend his limitation of only being able to use his powers in his native universe. Managing to cross over to another dimension within the multiverse, he and the Six were able to claim for S.W.O.R.D. what was they were searching for: the [[White Hot Room|Mysterium Tremendum]].{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1}}

| Powers                  = Eden is a '''[[Homo superior|Mutant]]''' born with the following abilities:
[[File:Eden Fesi (Earth-616) from New Avengers Vol 3 28 001.png|thumb|right|Manifold teleporting Black Widow and Spider-Woman]]
'''Space Communication:''' While generally believed to be an extremely powerful teleporter, Eden in fact is an universal shaper; he can directly communicate with the universe itself and ask it for that he wants. The universe then would adjust and mold in a way needed to accomplish his wish.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 3}} However, his powers only work in his [[Earth-616|native reality]].{{r|Avengers NOW! #1}}
*'''Teleportation:''' He can ask the universe to fold itself in a way that he would be able to reach from one point to another with a single step. To him, the distance between two points doesn't matter, he only needs to know his starting and end points.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 2}}{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 3}} He can teleport even from one galaxy to another without problem.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 16}} He can bring other people with him, at least up to several hundred people simultaneously.<!-- he teleported away all passengers on the plane -->{{r|Avengers Vol 5 14}}
**'''Portal Creation:''' He can directly connect two places via portals of various size from small enough to observe that is happening on the other side{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 3}} to big enough for a spaceship to pass through.{{r|Avengers NOW! #1}} He determines that can pass through his portals and for how long they stays open.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 9}}
**'''Remote Teleportation:''' He can bring things from another place to him, for example, teleport solar plasma from the Sun into his hand,{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 4}} or bring things/other people away without teleporting himself.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 17}}
*'''Positional Awareness:''' He almost always instinctively know his exact position in space.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 15}}
*'''Space Folding:''' He can lock the space around other beings, even as powerful as [[Adam Blackveil (Earth-616)|Adam Blackveil]], not allowing them to move.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 9}} He also can fold the space around dangerous objects, for example, solar plasma, to prevent it from harming anyone.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 4}}
*'''Invisibility:''' He can bend the space around the area he occupies so light would not reach him in order to accommodate invisibility.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 3}}

| Abilities               = '''Expert Survivalist:''' He is able to survive in the harshest of environments without a problem and is able to find sustenance in those same hostile places. It also makes him a skilled hunter.

'''Medical Knowledge:''' During the Infinity event, Eden has shown that he possesses remarkable skill as a healer. He was able to nurse soldiers when no one else could, what makes it more incredible is the fact that most of the soldiers he nursed were aliens. Eden also possesses a great deal of knowledge about useful plants and herbs.

'''Hand-to-Hand Combatant (Advanced):''' Eden is a naturally good fighter in his own right. He was trained in the fighting forms of his people and can hold his own against multiple combatants. He is also adept at combining his fighting prowess with his teleportation powers.

'''Spearmanship:''' Eden's weapon of choice is a long spear which he uses with great skill. He is able to use it so well that it could be considered an extension of his body. It is not only his weapon of choice but also his hunting tool.

| Strength                = Eden possesses the normal strength of a human who engages in intensive and extensive physical exercise. As a result, he can press lift up to twice his body-weight with some effort. It should be noted that Eden has a healthy lifestyle.
| Weaknesses              = Manifold can not use his powers outside of his native Universe.{{r|Avengers NOW! #1}}

Eden needs to know his point of origin before activating his powers. If he gets lost or turned around inside a windowless structure, he needs to find a reference point, such as the sky and horizon, to re-calibrate his internal senses before teleporting.{{r|Secret Warriors #9}}

Mystical beings can disrupt his portals.{{r|Avengers NOW! #1}}

| Notes                   = * An alternate [[Manifold (Earth-1331)|Manifold]] was seen in [[Wakanda]], strongly different in appearance from Eden, except for his powers and costume. It is unknown if he was his counterpart or another universal shaper with similar powers and title. [[Yabbat Ummon Turru (Earth-1365)|Black Swan]] used this other Manifold to come to Earth-616 during an Incursion. The Manifolds powers only work in the universe they're from so once they came to Earth-616 Black Swan had no use for her former ally and killed him. A third Manifold was seen to have been working for Black Swan in another reality viewed by the Illuminati.
* Black Swan claims that the different versions of Manifold throughout the multiverse were created by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Rabum Alal]]
** It is implied that the Manifolds were planted throughout the multiverse by [[Owen Reece (Earth-616)|Molecule Man]] to assist Doom in finding his counterparts to kill in his quest to thwart the [[Beyonders]]. This also explains the Manifold's apparent instinct to "somehow know where things are supposed to go" when teleporting as described by Hank Pym about the [[Manifold (Multiverse)|multiversal Manifold]] cultivated from hundreds of samples by the Builders.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 30}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 33}}
