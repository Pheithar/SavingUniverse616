| History                 = 
[[File:Anthony Masters (Earth-616) from Taskmaster Vol 1 4 02.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Tony in his early childhood]]
===Early Life===
Tony Masters was born with the ability to duplicate the movements of others through brief observation.{{r|Taskmaster #4}} At the age of 8, he continued to discover his photographic reflexes to immediately copy other skills like learning to dive in a swimming pool when he saw someone else having performed a dive, learning special techniques from the best NBA basketball players, and learning to twirl a lasso by watching cowboys on T.V.{{r|Taskmaster #4}}

===S.H.I.E.L.D.===
[[File:Anthony Masters (Earth-616) from Taskmaster Vol 2 3 001.png||thumb|left|190px|Tony injecting himself with the modified [[Super-Soldier Serum]]]]
As an adult, Tony joined [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and became an agent.{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 3}} During a mission, Tony found an elderly scientist, shot in the chest and slowly dying.{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 3}} Before the scientist died, he gave Tony a syringe containing an experimental [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi]] version of the [[Super-Soldier Serum]] to enhance the abilities gained through his photographic reflexes.{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 3}} After Tony injected himself with the Nazi Super-Soldier Serum, he began to develop additional powers, set back by the fact that the memories he gained by watching others overwrote his personal memories.{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 3}} As a result, Tony forgot his wife and field agent partner, [[Mercedes Merced (Earth-616)|Mercedes Masters]], as well as his own history with S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 3}} Mercedes crafted an elaborate set-up to help control and guide Tony in his new guise as "Taskmaster". Using a series of muscle memory and reflexive tasks, she linked Taskmaster to "the Org": his "handler" between jobs and a constant to keep him on task despite his frequently overwritten memory. The Org was actually Mercedes herself, gathering intelligence and feeding it back to S.H.I.E.L.D. thanks to Taskmaster's reports. Tony, therefore, became the ultimate double agent in the super-villain underground -- one who didn't even know what he was.{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 4}}

===Taskmaster===
Tony decided to use his stolen capital to establish a base of operations to train criminals known as the [[Taskmaster's Academy]]. He took the name Taskmaster and began training anyone that could pay. One of the first men he trained was [[Don of the Dead (Earth-616)|Don of the Dead]], a crime lord and also the governor of Michoacán in western Mexico. To show solidarity to the Don and his men, Tony donned a skull-inspired mask as an homage to the [[Wikipedia:Santa Muerte|Santa Muerte]], a Catholic personification of [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]].{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 2}}

When [[Pernell Solomon (Earth-616)|Dr. Pernell Solomon]] used the Solomon Institute for the Criminally Insane as a front, he used Taskmaster's school's resources to create a clone of himself called [[Selbe (Earth-616)|Selbe]]. When Dr. Solomon required an organ donation due to possessing an extremely rare blood type, the clone, learning of his fate, contacted the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. Taskmaster captured [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]], the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]], and [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] when they attacked the site. Taskmaster battled the Avengers, who exposed his front operation. He was defeated and fled after a fight with the Avengers' newest member, the robot [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]], whose lack of body language expression made it impossible for Taskmaster to predict her next move.{{r|Avengers #194|196}}

In addition to his training academies, Taskmaster also lent himself out as a mercenary or private instructor. He trained [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|John Walker]] to be the new Captain America for the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]],{{r|Captain America #334}} then trained [[Daniel Leighton (Earth-616)|Cutthroat]] to fight Captain America on behalf of the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]].{{r|Captain America #396}}

===New Taskmaster===
Eventually, the Taskmaster considerably changed his appearance. He wore a costume apparently modeled after tactical body armor, replacing his previous pirate-themed garb. The Taskmaster also ceased carrying an arsenal of duplicate weapons. Taskmaster began operating as a more traditional mercenary instead of as an instructor. He first met [[Sondra Brandenberg (Earth-616)|Sandi Brandenberg]] after beginning this mercenary M.O.{{r|Taskmaster #1|4}}

[[File:Anthony Masters and Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Taskmaster Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Taskmaster vs Iron Man]]
Taskmaster spent some time around [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Wade Wilson]] after Deadpool became famous for the Four Winds hit and hired Sandi as his personal assistant. Wilson was not responsible for the hit, however, and the real assassin [[Black Swan (Earth-616)|Black Swan]] came after him and his friends. Wilson and the Swan were seemingly killed in an explosion.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 69}}

When Sandi found a stray amnesiac with super-healing powers, she brought him home because she thought he must be Mr. Wilson. Taskmaster reluctantly helped train "[[Agent X|Alex Hayden]]" at Sandi's request, but thought such an inexperienced merc would just get her into more trouble. He tried to have Alex killed by setting him up on a job to steal the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]]'s .45s, and later reported to the surviving Four Winds that Hayden was Wilson. When Sandi was put in danger by this last act, though, Taskmaster chose to stand side-by-side with Hayden and his friend [[Inez Temple (Earth-616)|Outlaw]] against the Four Winds.{{r|Agent X #1|6}}

[[File:Deadpool Vol 4 9 page -- Anthony Masters (Earth-616).png|thumb|left|200px|Deadpool making fun of Taskmaster's mask and name.]]
Alex and Sandi eventually slept together, which nearly drove Taskmaster nuts. Things got even more complicated when both Deadpool and Black Swan returned. In the end, Taskmaster and Sandi seemingly ended up together with Hayden and Outlaw reunited, and the entire group stayed together for a time as Agency X.{{r|Agent X #13|15}}

Taskmaster was eventually hired by the [[Committee (Earth-616)|Committee]] to take out [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]]. He raided Spector's apartment but was unable to kill him. Spector piloted his [[Moon Knight's Helicopter|Mooncopter]] to the Committee's Manhattan headquarters and flew it directly into their office. Miraculously, all of the Committee members survived the attack.{{r|{{cl|Moon Knight Vol 5 3}}-[[Moon Knight Vol 5 6|6]]}}

===[[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]]===
After earning a presidential pardon by way of [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] for proving the security problems on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]],{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 2 2}} he was briefly one of the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts']] detainees, later being released and assigned to [[Camp Hammond]] to serve as a trainer for [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] recruits while their former drill instructor, [[Joseph Green (Earth-616)|Gauntlet]], recuperated from injuries sustained from [[Steven Harmon (Earth-616)|one of his trainees]]. During this time, a formerly deceased Initiative member, [[Michael van Patrick (Earth-616)|Michael Van Patrick]] acquired a weapon called the [[Tactigon]] and began assaulting everyone at the camp. The Taskmaster had little interest in participating in the fight, preferring instead to sit on the sidelines with one of his charges, [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #9|10}}

===[[Dark Reign]] and [[Siege (Event)|Siege]]===
[[File:Anthony Masters (Earth-616) from Avengers The Initiative Vol 1 32 001.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Taskmaster fighting Thor in Siege.]]
After [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark Reign|power grab]], Taskmaster took over training for the entire Initiative and participated in the [[Siege (Event)|siege]] of [[Asgard]]. He joined in the fight against Thor since it would help reputation as an assassin. He fought both Captain Americas at the same time with unexpected success. Able to see that his side was not winning the fight, Taskmaster fled with the Constrictor to return to mercenary work. He taunted Norman Osborn with the knowledge that he had earlier assisted Deadpool.{{Citation}}

===Discovering His Past===
After losing his weapons in Tokyo,{{r|Age of Heroes #3}} Tony began a quest to remember some of the things he had been forgetting. On this quest, his former handler, The Org, seemed to put out a billion-dollar bounty on his head.{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 1}} Many of the teams he formerly trained, including [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] and [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], attempted to collect the bounty by killing him, but only succeeded in tracking him on his quest. It was during this memory quest that Tony temporarily learned his true past, that of a married former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who mistakenly took a Nazi serum that granted him his extraordinary abilities. He also briefly met his wife and handler, Mercedes Merced. Ultimately, he was forced to learn the new fighting skill of [[Redshirt (Earth-616)|Redshirt]], the man who put out the fake bounty, which erased all of his knowledge regarding his past. Apparently, this had happened repeatedly in the past.{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 4}}

===Secret Avengers===
Taskmaster was asked to become a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Secret Avengers (S.H.I.E.L.D.) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] team after being rescued by [[Nicholas Fury, Jr. (Earth-616)|Nick Fury Jr.]] from the criminal nation of [[Bagalia]]. His first mission was to join A.I.M.'s High Council as a double-agent, taking the role of Minister of Defense.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 2}}

When he tried to free [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]] from A.I.M. captivity, he was attacked from behind by the [[TESS-One (Earth-616)|TESS-One]], and shot in the head by Mockingbird who had been brainwashed by A.I.M.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 13}} However, Mockingbird purposely missed any vitals and Taskmaster was revealed to be alive but left in a vegetative state. As they thought he was dead, the Secret Avengers left him behind, but his survival was discovered by [[Marvin Flumm (Earth-616)|Mentallo]], who had developed a friendship with him. Mentallo kept his survival a secret and sought to cure him with his nanobots.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 16}}

===[[Secret Empire (Event)|Secret Empire]]===
After briefly becoming a part of [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]]'s Hydra,{{r|All-New Captain America #1}} Taskmaster moved his base of operations to Bagalia, becoming the sheriff of the small lawless country.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #3}} Around this time, Captain America had been secretly supplanted by an [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|evil version]] of himself from an [[Earth-61311|alternate timeline]]. He was involved in an operation in Bagalia,{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #1}} and Taskmaster managed to obtain a recording of him showing his loyalty for Hydra. Taskmaster and [[Eric O'Grady (LMD) (Earth-616)|Black Ant]] attempted to sell the recording to [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]]. However, [[Elisa Sinclair (Earth-61311)|Elisa Sinclair]], an ally of the evil Captain America, intercepted them{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #12}} and forced them to become her new bodyguards.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #14}}

By the time Hydra rose to power and conquered the United States, the duo had become members of [[Avengers (Hydra) (Earth-616)|Hydra's own Avengers]].{{r|Secret Empire #1}} Both Taskmaster and Black Ant decided to switch allegiances during the final battle between Hydra and the resistance as soon as Hydra started losing. They freed some of Hydra's prisoners, namely the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]], in hopes that the young heroes would later put in a good word for them.{{r|Secret Empire #8}} Following Hydra's fall and the return to normalcy, Taskmaster returned to operating as a mercenary.{{r|Spider-Men II #1}}

===[[Hunted (Spider-Man Story Arc)|Hunted]]===
[[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven]] hired Taskmaster and Black Ant to capture all animal-inspired criminals to be imprisoned in [[Central Park]] for him, to fight against poachers, so that everyone he thought acted dishonorably would annihilate each other.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 20}} Ants are also animals, so Kraven convinced Taskmaster to betray Black Ant, paying more for him than other prey.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 18}}

Tony felt guilty for cheating his best friend, and shortly thereafter he was forced through blackmail by the [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Lizard]] to pretend to catch him and take him to Kraven, so that Curt could find [[William Connors (Earth-616)|his son]], who was one of the many to have been kidnapped.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 19}} When the force field collapsed, some prisoners tried to take revenge on Black Ant, but Taskmaster prevented it and took Eric to safety, consolidating their friendship.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 23}}

| Powers                  = '''Artificially Enhanced Physiology:''' Tony was born with the ability to duplicate other abilities that he either saw someone else performed or watched on T.V.{{r|Taskmaster #4}} After injecting himself with a experimental Nazi version of the [[Super-Soldier Serum]], his brain capacity begin to absorb knowledge instantaneously.{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 3}} The serum also altered his brain chemistry to make him hypercognitive in the area of skill observation and retention.{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 3}} This particular serum was an elaborate modification of the adrenal steroid cortisol, which even enhanced Tony's short-term memory.{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 3}}
* '''Photographic Reflexes:''' Tony's primarily superhuman power is his photographic reflexes.{{r|Taskmaster #4}}{{r|{{cl|Taskmaster Vol 2 1}}-[[Taskmaster Vol 2 4|4]]}} He can watch another person's physical movements and duplicate them without any practice or training, no matter how complex.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} Tony is able to duplicate almost any physical activity after seeing it done by someone else only once.{{r|Avengers #196}} Taskmaster can use this ability to master complex gymnastics routines and play difficult pieces of music. However, he typically prefers to use this ability to copy the combat skills, both armed and unarmed, of costumed crime-fighters and expert martial artists from around the world.{{r|Avengers #196}} By reviewing recordings of movements periodically, Tony can retain duplicated moves indefinitely. When facing an opponent, he has already studied countless of martial arts, and can virtually predict his enemy's attacks.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} He can also copy the subtle muscle movements of others so precisely that he can at times do things such as copying another person's voice so precisely as to fool voice recognition software although he must practice a voice to ensure he has perfected it enough to fool such devices.{{r|Taskmaster #1|2}}{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 4}}
** '''Physical Movement Prediction:''' Tony can also do things such as figuring out the sleight of hand techniques of a master poker cheater simply by watching them.{{r|Taskmaster #1}} He has often shown the ability to actually predict an opponent's next move before they make it if he has studied their fighting style enough.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} Opponents who are skilled at improvisational fighting styles, or who have a more random unpredictable style are less likely to have their moves predicted by Taskmaster.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 2}}
** '''Superhuman Agility:''' Due to his photographic reflexes, Tony can push his body past it's natural limits, allowing his agility to match that of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]]'s superhuman agility.{{r|Taskmaster #1}}
** '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Due to Tony's photographic reflexes, his reaction speed is greater than that of a normal human. He easily caught a crescent blade thrown at him from behind by Moon Knight, without even looking.{{r|Moon Knight Vol 5 5}} He was also able to deflect bullets with a chain,{{r|Thunderbolts #131}} and even catch a bullet that was shot at him.{{r|Taskmaster #4}}
** '''Superhuman Speed:''' Due to his photographic reflexes, Tony can push his body past it's natural limits, allowing him to temporarily move at speeds twice as fast as a normal human.{{r|Taskmaster #4}} He has discovered that after watching martial arts movies in double speed, he can briefly duplicate the moves at double speed, effectively giving him a limited form of superhuman speed.{{r|Taskmaster #4}} However, he can only maintain his heightened state for minutes before risking temporarily physical damage to his body.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}

| Abilities               = '''[[Master Martial Artist]]:''' Taskmaster is easily known as one of the greatest formidable armed and unarmed combatants in the [[Earth-616|Marvel Universe]].{{r|Avengers #196}} He truly mastered all forms of martial arts including modern and historical styles, boxing, wrestling, swordsmanship, archery, marksmanship, juggling, gymnastics, aerial acrobatics, and sleight of hand. Taskmaster learned the personal fighting styles of countless individuals,{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} such as: [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]],{{r|Marvel Team-Up #103}} [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc the Leaper]],{{r|Taskmaster Vol 3 4}} [[Jesse Black Crow (Earth-616)|Black Crow]],{{r|Civil War #7}} [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]],{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]],{{r|Thunderbolts #131}} [[Mark Todd (Earth-616)|Blazing Skull]],{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 3}} [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]], [[Carl Burbank (Earth-616)|Bushwacker]], [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]], [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]],{{r|Avengers #223}}{{r|Captain America Vol 3 44}}{{r|Captain America Vol 9 4}} [[Shen Kuei (Earth-616)|Cat]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 167}} [[Frank Payne (Earth-616)|Constrictor]],{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]],{{r|Daredevil #293}} [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]],{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 2}} [[Kevin Marlow (Earth-616)|The Destroyer]],{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 3}} [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]],{{r|Elektra Vol 2 7}} [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]],{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]],{{r|Avengers #223}}{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 1}} [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]],{{r|Avengers #223}} [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]],{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]],{{r|Moon Knight Vol 5 4|5}} [[Michael van Patrick (Earth-616)|MVP]],{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Annual Vol 1 1}} [[Jack Monroe (Earth-616)|Nomad]],{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} [[Elton Healey (Earth-616)|Oddball]],{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]],{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} [[Keniuchio Harada (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]],{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} [[Redshirt (Earth-616)|Redshirt]],{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 4}} [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang Chi]],{{r|Taskmaster Vol 3 3}} [[James Bourne (Earth-616)|Solo]],{{r|Civil War #7}} [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]],{{r|Avengers #223}}{{r|Marvel Team-Up #103}} [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]],{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 1}} [[Greer Grant (Earth-616)|Tigra]],{{r|Avengers #223}} [[Lonnie Lincoln (Earth-616)|Tombstone]],{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} [[Tumbler]],{{Citation}} [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|US Agent]],{{Citation}} [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Warbird]],{{Citation}} [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]],{{r|Taskmaster Vol 3 3}} [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]],{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} [[Maximillian Zaran (Earth-616)|Zaran]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 167}} and many others.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}} During the [[Siege (Event)|Siege]] on [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]], Taskmaster's combat skills were shown to be so advanced that he easily defeated two [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] soldiers by outwitting them in both armed and unarmed combat.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #32}} He has trained numerous of criminals in basic hand to hand combat.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #32}}
*'''Advanced Pedagogy''' Given the [[:Category:Trained by Taskmaster|number of students]] that he's taught, Taskmaster is adroit in training students in any of the many styles that he knows.

'''Master Tactician:''' Tony is a master strategist and tactician (seen particularly in combat with Iron Man{{r|Taskmaster #1}} and against both [[Captain America]]s during the [[Siege (Event)|Siege]] of [[Asgard]]).{{r|Siege: Captain America #1}}

'''Weapon Mastery:''' Due to his powers and his use of different peoples' fighting styles, Tony has become a master in all melee weaponry, including swordsmanship from [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]] and [[Silver Samurai]]. He has displayed skill with Billy Clubs from observing [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]],{{r|Avengers #223}} as well as knife fighting from [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]].{{r|Taskmaster Vol 3 3}}

'''Master Marksman:''' Tony is a master in the fields of marksman. He has the marksmanship of Hawkeye, Punisher, and Bullseye. Tony also has self-marksman skills, making him extremely proficient with throwing projectile weapons, archery, and firearms.

'''Master Assassin:''' Tony is a master deadly assassin. Captain America has stated that Tony is considered to be one of the most dangerous men alive.{{r|Captain America Vol 9 4}}

'''Meditation:''' Tony learned meditation techniques in Tibet that allow him to slow his breathing and heart rate and survive for extended periods of time without air, this also means that to the untrained eye he will appear to be dead.{{r|Taskmaster #4}} He also claims to have learned forensic methods from [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|CIA]] Agents and [[Mossad (Earth-616)|Mossad]] Operatives.{{citation}}

| Strength                = Tony is able to lift at least twice his body-weight, enabling him to lift 375 lbs.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #11}}
| Weaknesses              = 
* The Taskmaster is not capable of duplicating a physical feat if the effort to do so requires superhuman effort. For instance, while he could view an opponent lifting a car, he could not do so because his body can't duplicate the superhuman strength required to do so.
