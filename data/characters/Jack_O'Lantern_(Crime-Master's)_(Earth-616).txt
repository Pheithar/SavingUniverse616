===Origin===
[[File:Jack O'Lantern (Crime-Master's) (Earth-616) and Bennett Brant (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 2 11 0002.jpg|thumb|left|Growing up]]
"Jack" was a bad child who disobeyed his parents and hurt animals. One Halloween, he came to the house of the [[Bennett Brant (Earth-616)|Crime-Master]], who knocked him out with gas and kidnapped him. Initially, he was afraid of him, but he soon grew to consider him his true father. Over time, he was trained to be a master assassin, and to prove his allegiance to him, Jack returned to his parents and murdered them with no remorse nor mercy. After the fact, he developed his signature, in which he scooped out the brains of his victims and placed a candle inside them, giving them the appearance of a jack-o-lantern. Jack took the name Jack O'Lantern and killed those who have used the name in the past.{{r|Venom Vol 2 11}}

===Venom===
In the Eastern European country of Nrosvekistan, Crime-Master sent Jack to find Doctor Ekmecic, a specialist in making weapons from [[Vibranium#Anti-Metal|Antarctic Vibranium]]. The new government agent [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Venom]], war hero Flash Thompson, was also trying to bring in Ekmecic, and though neither succeeded, they both became arch-enemies.{{r|Venom Vol 2 1}}

Later on, while Venom was on a mission in the [[Savage Land]] to confiscate Crime-Master's Antarctic Vibranium shipment, he learned Venom's identity and sent Jack to kidnap [[Elizabeth Brant (Earth-616)|Betty Brant]], his girlfriend, forcing Venom to hand over the Vibranium to Crime-Master to ensure her safety.{{r|Venom Vol 2 4}}

After Flash's father died, Jack appeared at his funeral and dragged Flash to Crime-Master's headquarters, where he threatens to kill Flash's family if he doesn't go on a mission for him in Las Vegas with Jack O'Lantern.{{r|Venom Vol 2 10}} Together, they broke into a secret lab hidden within a Vegas casino with the intention of stealing the [[Toxin (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Toxin symbiote]]. But the Venom symbiote reacted to it negatively and tried to destroy it, leading to an all-out brawl between an out of control Venom and Jack O'Lantern. Jack was no match and promised to leave his family alone if he let him leave with the symbiote. Venom regained his composure, but Jack fled with Toxin.{{r|Venom Vol 2 12}}

===Savage Six===
Crime-Master later brought together Jack O'Lantern, [[Richard Deacon (Earth-616)|Human Fly]], [[Roland Burroughs (Earth-616)|Death Adder]], [[Gregory Nettles (Earth-616)|Megatak]], as well as himself to form the [[Savage Six (Crime-Master's) (Earth-616)|Savage Six]]. Venom decided to end things once and for all and attempted to assassinate Crime-Master. In response, Crime-Master ended their deal and threatened to kill Betty and his family. To round out their team, Crime-Master forcibly bonded the Toxin symbiote to [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]].{{r|Venom Vol 2 22}}

Working as a team, the Savage Six kidnapped Flash's family. Venom revealed his identity to Betty after he saved her, but she was taken again while he saved his sister. Then, while he worked over Human Fly for Betty's location, Crime-Master pulled off his mask in front of Betty and revealed himself to be her brother, Bennett Brant. Venom eventually found them and tried to kill Crime-Master. When he failed to do so, Betty shot and killed him.

Since then, Jack O'Lantern had gone on a killing spree, which escalated on Father's Day. Venom tracked him to a sewer thanks to the hidden trail Jack had left behind for him. There, he discovered that Jack had dug up the corpse of Flash's father and blew up the room. In the fight that ensued, it looked like Jack O'Lantern was going to win until Venom took his father's gun from his holster and shot him but choose not to kill him.{{r|Venom Vol 2 22}}

Jack was locked up in [[Raft|the Raft]],{{r|Venom Vol 2 23}} but he managed to continue his operations using [[Jack O'Lantern (Impostor) (Earth-616)|an employee of a storage facility]] as a replacement, who Jack's robots brainwashed.{{r|Venom Vol 2 39}}

===[[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|AXIS]]===
Jack O'Lantern was recruited by Magneto to fight against [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Skull]]'s [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Red Onslaught]] form in [[Genosha]].{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 2}} His moral compass was inverted with all of those in Genosha when a spell meant to affect only the Red Skull affected everyone on the island.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 3}}

He later rejoined the (now-inverted) villains to prevent the inverted X-Men from detonating a gene bomb which would've killed everyone on Earth who wasn't a mutant.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 6}} When a reinversion spell was cast, Jack O'Lantern became evil once again.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 9}}

===Later Developments===
At some point, Jack O'Lantern was apprehended by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and placed in [[Pleasant Hill]] which served as the most unlikeliest of prisons.{{r|Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 6}} But was later part of the breakout.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Omega Vol 1 1}} 

Jack later accepted a contract to kill [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]]'s handler [[Jack Hammer (Earth-616)|Weasel]]. However the intervention of Deadpool and [[Melody Jacobs (Earth-616)|Threnody]] prevented this.{{r|Deadpool: Assassin Vol 1 4}}
In an altercation with [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]], Jack was badly injured after Venom threw him off an apartment and jumped onto his back. Jack was spared when Venom was abruptly pulled into an interdimensional portal,{{r|Venomverse Vol 1 1}} and was hospitalized for his spinal trauma. Undergoing extensive plastic surgery to restore his face, Jack underwent intensive therapy and was released to civilian life; but quickly grew bored with his mundane job and resumed his career as a super-villain.{{r|Black Panther vs. Deadpool Vol 1 3}} Following Deadpool to [[Wakanda]],{{r|Black Panther vs. Deadpool Vol 1 2}} Jack engaged both Deadpool and [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] in combat but was killed when Deadpool shot him in the head.{{r|Black Panther vs. Deadpool Vol 1 3}}

===Resurrection===

Sent to [[Mephisto's Realm|Hell]] after his death, Jack was transformed into a demon and began repeatedly assailing [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Johnny Blaze]] for the Devil's Throne. After suffering a particularly humiliating defeat, he was approached by [[Lilith (Earth-616)|Lilith]] - who offered him a chance to return to the world of the living in exchange for serving her. Upon his return, Jack was angered that [[Jack O'Lantern (Impostor II) (Earth-616)|other people]] had taken up his supervillain identity after his death. As part of his deal with Lilith, he attempted to assassinate [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Danny Ketch]], still believing him to be a [[Ghost Rider]]. Upon seeing that Ketch was now a Spirit of Corruption, Jack attempted to talk his way out of a fight by revealing Lilith had sent him but was cut down and sent back to Hell.{{r|Spirits of Ghost Rider: Mother of Demons Vol 1 1}}
