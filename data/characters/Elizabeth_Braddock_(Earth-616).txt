Psi Division (Earth-616)|Psi Division]], her path as a secret agent crossed with her brother's super-hero activities.{{r|{{cl|Daredevils Vol 1 2}}-[[Daredevils Vol 1 11|11]]}} Betsy acted as an ally of her brother in several conflicts and even adopted the Captain Britain mantle.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 13}} After being blinded by the [[Slaymaster (Earth-616)|Slaymaster]], Betsy stood down as Captain Britain,{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 14}} only to be captured and to have her sight restored by [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]] and [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]].{{r|New Mutants Annual Vol 1 2}} Rescued by the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], Betsy joined the ranks of the latter as '''Psylocke'''.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 213}}

| History                 = 
===Early Life===
[[File:Brian Braddock (Earth-616), James Braddock Jr. (Earth-616), Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) and James Braddock Sr. (Otherworld) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 23 001.png|right|thumb|250px|As a child, with her brothers and her father]]
[[James Braddock Sr. (Otherworld)|Sir James Braddock]] was a denizen of [[Otherworld]], an other-dimensional realm. [[Merlyn (Otherworld)|Merlyn]] sent James to [[Earth-616]] to father the champion who would be known as Captain Britain. In [[England]], Sir James established a distinguished career as a research scientist. He married [[Elizabeth Hartwood (Earth-616)|Lady Braddock]], set up home at [[Braddock Manor]] and had a child, named [[James Braddock Jr. (Earth-616)|Jamie]], whose subverted genes made him unfit to be the hero Merlyn expected. Almost a decade later, Braddock had two more children, the twins [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Brian]] and Elizabeth, nicknamed "Betsy".{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 7}} As a child, Betsy was closer to her older brother Jamie than to her twin brother Brian, idolizing Jamie for his adventurous lifestyle as a racing driver.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 256}}{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 23}} When Betsy was a teenager, she moved to New York City to pursue a modelling career, where her telepathic mutant powers activated in a traumatic experience.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 3}} It was never revealed what consequences transpired from Betsy's power activation, since she seemed not to be able access them in her early adult years.

Betsy's parents were killed in an explosion caused by the malfunctioning computer [[Mastermind (Computer) (Earth-616)|Mastermind]].{{r|Captain Britain Vol 1 14}} After their deaths, Betsy worked as a charter pilot.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 1 8}} Soon after Brian became the hero [[Captain Britain]], Betsy alerted him that their brother Jamie had been injured when testing his racing car in the grounds of Braddock Manor in an apparent attack. Betsy flew Brian back to the Manor, but their plane was downed by the psychic powers of [[Christopher Thorn (Earth-616)|Dr. Synne]].{{r|Captain Britain Vol 1 8}} Luckily, both survived the second accident, but Dr. Synne mind-controlled Betsy into trying to kill her brothers. The Braddock brothers managed to overpower her.{{r|{{cl|Captain Britain Vol 1 9}}-[[Captain Britain Vol 1 10|10]]}}

Following the incident, Betsy was taken to the nearby [[Morder Research Centre]], unwittingly being delivered into the hands of one of Synne's agents, [[Doctor Ramsey (Earth-616)|Dr. Ramsey]].{{r|Captain Britain Vol 1 10}} Brian defeated Synne, and Ramsey reverted to his true allegiances as an agent of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi]] [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]], claiming Betsy and Jamie as hostages.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 1 15}} Both were freed by Captain Britain and his new ally, [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Captain Britain Vol 1 20}} Some time later, Betsy had a visionary dream warning her of Brian's peril when fighting the mad [[Willard Scott (Earth-616)|Lord Hawk]]:{{r|Captain Britain Vol 1 34}} an indication of her mutant psychic abilities.

===S.T.R.I.K.E.===
Betsy quit the charter business and took up modelling,{{r|Super Spider-Man & Captain Britain Vol 1 243}} gaining international praise in her career.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 3}} As her psychic powers grew, she made mental contact with a [[Special Tactical Reserve for International Key Emergencies (Earth-616)|S.T.R.I.K.E.]] Psi agent, being recruited by [[Matthew (Gabriel) (Earth-616)|Agent Matthew]], with whom she pursued a brief romance. Some time later, Betsy became the lover of fellow psi, [[Thomas Lennox (Earth-616)|Tom Lennox]].{{r|Daredevils Vol 1 3}} Maintaining her modelling career as a cover for S.T.R.I.K.E., Betsy attempted to infiltrate the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]], where her father had been a member, but she was warned off by [[Sage (Earth-616)|Tessa]].{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 3}} Around this period, also at the Hellfire Club, she met the X-Man [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Warren Worthington III]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 18}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616), Brian Braddock (Earth-616), Linda McQuillan (Earth-238) and Cherubim (Earth-616) from Captain Britain Vol 2 9 001.png|left|thumb|150px|Against the Warpies]]

Betsy had lost track of her brother while he adventured in [[United States of America|America]] and in the [[Otherworld]]. He returned in time to save her when S.T.R.I.K.E. psis were targeted for assassination by the [[Slaymaster (Earth-616)|Slaymaster]], who had been hired by the crime-lord [[Vixen (British Crimelord) (Earth-616)|Vixen]] to cover her takeover of S.T.R.I.K.E. Betsy, Tom, and [[Alison Double (Earth-616)|Alison Double]] sought refuge in Braddock Manor, but soon had to flee from there as Brian and his allies, [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Saturnyne]] and the [[Special Executive (Multiverse)|Special Executive]], battled against a hero-killing, extra-dimensional cybiote, the [[Fury (Earth-238)|Fury]].{{r|{{cl|Daredevils Vol 1 2}}-[[Daredevils Vol 1 11|11]]}}

With the insane mutant reality-warper, [[James Jaspers (Earth-616)|Mad Jim Jaspers]], taking over the country, Betsy and her friends hid out in [[London (England)|London]].{{r|Mighty World of Marvel Vol 2 8}} Tom was killed, and Betsy and Alison were captured by Jaspers' forces.{{r|Mighty World of Marvel Vol 2 9}} The two women ended up in a concentration camp until Jaspers' reign was brought to an end, partially by the efforts of Captain Britain. Betsy, who had been in mental contact with Tom when he died, met and convalesced under the care of [[Victoria Bentley (Earth-616)|Victoria Bentley]] at the camp. Victoria not only helped her recover, but taught her to harness the trauma she had experienced to strengthen her psi powers.{{r|Mighty World of Marvel Vol 2 13}}

===Captain Britain===
[[File:Mastermind (Computer) (Earth-616), Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) and Linda McQuillan (Earth-238) from Captain Britain Vol 2 13 001.png|right|thumb|150px|Being offered Captain Britain's mantle]]
Betsy eventually returned home to Braddock Manor,{{r|Mighty World of Marvel Vol 2 16}} where Brian fought a counterpart of his from [[Earth-794|another reality]], the sadist [[Byron Bra-Dhok (Earth-794)|Kaptain Briton]]. Briton won the encounter, impersonating Brian, while extra-dimensional mercenaries, the [[Technet (Multiverse)|Technet]], took Brian to Briton's fascist reality.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 5}} Briton tried to rape Betsy, but she fried his brain with her psychic abilities, killing him instantly.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 6}} Subsequently, [[Resources Control Executive (Earth-616)|R.C.X.]], the agency which had replaced S.T.R.I.K.E., came to Braddock Manor seeking Captain Britain's aid to help take care of the [[Warpies (Earth-616)|Warpies]], children who were genetically altered by Jaspers' attack. One of the agents who made the approach was Betsy's old flame, Matthew (now using the codename Gabriel). Brian refused to work with them, much to Betsy's rage, and they were advised by the computer Mastermind to trick him and his girlfriend, [[Meggan Puceanu (Earth-616)|Meggan]], into leaving Braddock Manor.{{r|{{cl|Captain Britain Vol 2 7}}-[[Captain Britain Vol 2 8|8]]}} Gabriel then persuaded Betsy to become the new Captain Britain.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 13}}

Wearing Kaptain Briton's costume magnified Betsy's strength and enabled her to fly. The hero [[Linda McQuillan (Earth-238)|Captain UK]] trained Betsy in crime fighting skills, and they became partners for several months. Captain UK eventually opted to let Betsy follow a solo career as Captain Britain. Soon after, the Vixen lured Betsy into an ambush, where Slaymaster brutally blinded her. Brian felt his twin's pain through the psychic bond they shared. He came to Betsy's rescue, killing Slaymaster, and once again took up the Captain Britain mantle.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 13}} Betsy was offered new cybernetic eyes by R.C.X., but refused, preferring to rely on her telepathy to see. Betsy later accepted Gabriel's proposal of marriage and the engaged couple traveled to the [[Swiss Alps|Swiss Alps]], where they hoped Betsy could recuperate in peace.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 14}}

===Psylocke===
Unfortunately, Betsy was kidnapped from the Alps by [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]] and [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]], being surgically given artificial eyes. Mojo mentally controlled Betsy, renaming her [[Psylocke]], and had her star in a popular new show, the [[Wildways]], using her to lure children around the world into joining his junior team show, the [[Bratpack (Earth-616)|Bratpack]]. When Mojo captured some of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Xavier]]'s [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]], the rest of the group went to the TV show reality to save their teammates. Betsy was found and rescued by [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]] and [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]], and chose to stay at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], as her powers were [[Homo superior|mutant]] in origin.{{r|New Mutants Annual Vol 1 2}} Her bionic eyes were revealed to be cameras when Mojo transformed the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] into the [[X-Babies (Mojoverse)|X-Babies]] to film their adventures. Betsy and the New Mutants battled the de-aged X-Men to break them free of their brainwashing and defeat the spineless one.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 10}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) and Victor Creed (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 213 001.png|left|thumb|100px|Confronting Sabretooth at the X-Mansion]]

The [[Mutant Massacre|massacre]] of the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] occurred shortly thereafter. Betsy was charged with helping the wounded and staying in telepathic contact with the members of the X-Men who were in combat with the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 211|212}} After the first strike, Betsy faced the savage [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] in a brawl throughout the X-Mansion, destroying [[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebro]]. Impressed by Betsy's courage, the battle-ravaged X-Men offered her a position on the team, which she accepted, adopting the code name Psylocke.{{r|Uncanny X-Men 213}} Next, Betsy fought [[Alice MacAllister (Earth-616)|Malice]] with the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 214}} This was followed by a confrontation on [[Muir Island]] between [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] and the newest X-Men members—Psylocke, [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]], and [[Longshot (Mojoverse)|Longshot]]—which served as a baptism of fire for them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 218}} Back in [[New York (State)|New York]], X-Men leader [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] decided that, in order to safeguard their friends and families from their many enemies, the X-Men should go underground as a proactive strike force. Unexpectedly, [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] showed up to check on the team, and Storm ordered Betsy to erase the event from his memory. However, due to Professor Xavier's mental defenses, he remembered. Psylocke suggested killing Havok instead, much to his horror, although he still joined the team.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 219}}

When Brian and Meggan visited the X-Mansion, the X-Men were abducted by [[Horde (Earth-616)|Horde]], who planned to use them to retrieve the Crystal of Ultimate Vision from the [[Citadel of Light and Shadow]], where it was hidden. Illusions of each of the X-Men's most wished desires were cast. Psylocke was transformed into a metallic warrior as her heart desired physical invulnerability and she sacrificed herself to slow Horde down. [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], empowered to godhood, rejected this power, returning the X-Men and their friends home.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 11}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 223 001.png|right|thumb|150px|Manifesting her iconic psychic butterfly]]

The X-Men briefly made [[Alcatraz Island]] their new hideout when tracking the Marauders, who at the time hunted [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]]. Psylocke mainly acted as the psychic link between the members of the group.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 221|223}}

===Fall of the X-Men===
When Storm went missing, the X-Men searched for her at [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]]'s [[Eagle Plaza]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas (State)|Texas]], where they were attacked by [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]]. During the fight, a rift opened in the sky of Dallas and a maelstrom of bizarre events ensued. The X-Men and Freedom Force formed a temporary alliance to save the citizens of Dallas, until Psylocke recognized [[Roma (Otherworld)|Roma]] in [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]]' recent memories. Gaining access into the [[Starlight Citadel]], the X-Men battled the [[Adversary (Earth-616)|Adversary]] and sacrificed their lives to imprison him with a spell cast by Forge. These events had been broadcast on TV and the world believed the heroes to be dead. Roma actually restored the X-Men to life, and the X-Men used the opportunity to go underground.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 225|227}}

The group resurfaced in [[Australia]], occupying the former [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]]' [[Cooterman's Creek|hideout]] and freeing [[Gateway (Earth-616)|Gateway]] and [[Jessán Hoan (Earth-616)|Jessán Hoan]] in the process. With the Reavers thrown out, Roma presented the X-Men with the [[Siege Perilous]], a gem that created a portal which granted any person who walked through it judgment and a new chance at life.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 229}} Psylocke began wearing a body armor that Wolverine ordered from [[Landau, Luckman & Lake (Earth-616)|Landau, Luckman & Lake]] to prevent herself from being a liability to the team.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 232}} During this period, the X-Men battled [[Brood Mutants (Earth-616)|the Brood]] in [[Denver]]{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 233|234}} and [[Magistrates (Earth-616)|Magistrates]] in [[Genosha]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 235|238}} In the Reavers' hideout, Psylocke had various interactions with her teammates: during a training session, she psychically freed [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol Danvers]]' personality from Rogue's mind;{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 239}} and, to pass the time, she would pose for Colossus' painting.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 240}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 251 001.png|left|thumb|150px|Activating the Siege Perilous]]

When [[Inferno (Event)|Inferno]] was unleashed, Psylocke telepathically assisted the X-Men into probing into [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]]'s memories.{{r|Inferno (Event)}} Soon after, she went with Carol Danvers, in Rogue's body, to her old apartment, where they were attacked by the [[Master Mold (Earth-616)|Master Mold]] and [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]]. [[Robert Kelly (Earth-616)|Senator Robert Kelly]]'s [[Sharon Kelly (Earth-616)|wife]] was killed there and Betsy attempted to ease the pain of her passing. During the battle, the Master Mold absorbed Nimrod and got lost with Rogue by entering the Siege Perilous.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 246|247}} The X-Men had other losses: Longshot left to find clues to his origins and Storm was apparently killed by [[Nanny (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Nanny]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 248}} Psylocke assumed a leading role for the remaining X-Men, much to Havok's dislike, as he regarded Betsy as an unscrupulous telepath.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 249}}

The remaining X-Men went to the [[Savage Land]] following a call for help from [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]]. On the Savage Land, Psylocke had a premonition about the X-Men being slain by the Reavers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 250}} Psylocke opted to transport the X-Men through the Siege Perilous rather than face the threat of the Reavers, now led by [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]]. To convince Havok to go through the Siege Perilous, she confirmed his suspicions as she telepathically forced him to do so.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #251}}

===Body Swap===
[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 257 002.png|right|thumb|150px|Brainwashed by Matsu'o Tsurayaba into becoming Lady Mandarin]]
Psylocke emerged in Southeast Asia. In one of her more bizarre encounters, [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] crime lord [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba (Earth-616)|Matsu'o Tsurayaba]] captured her{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 255}} and had her switch bodies with his lover, an Asian assassin known as [[Kwannon (Earth-616)|Kwannon]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 256}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 32}} Psylocke was additionally brainwashed into becoming Lady Mandarin, working for the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]] in [[Hong Kong]]. She would regain her free will after establishing psychic contact with Wolverine.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 257|258}} The experience left Betsy and Kwannon physically switched and mentally merged. Psylocke, joined by Wolverine and [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]], stayed in [[Madripoor]]{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 268}} until the trio learned the New Mutants were captured by the Genoshan government, as part of an [[X-Tinction Agenda]] led by [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]]. They travelled to Genosha and rejoined the X-Men.{{r|X-Tinction Agenda}}

Back in [[Westchester County|Westchester]], Psylocke had to cope with the drastic changes she had undergone. At the X-Mansion, she and Jean Grey were attacked by the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 273}} Some time later, the X-Men retrieved [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] from the [[Shi'ar Empire]], after fighting [[Skrulls|Skrulls]], when Psylocke was momentarily replaced by a [[Elizabeth Braddock (War Skrull) (Earth-616)|War Skrull]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 274|277}} Once more led by Professor X, the X-Men faced the Shadow King on Muir Island, and Psylocke fell into his vile clutches.{{r|Muir Island Saga}}

===Blue Strike Force===
[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) and Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 1 0001.png|right|thumb|100px|Striking at Magneto]]
With the Shadow King defeated, [[X-Factor (Earth-616)]] merged into the X-Men, and Psylocke became part of [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]' Blue Team, clashing in their first mission against her former ally [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and his [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]].{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 1}}-[[X-Men Vol 2 3|3]]}} In their following mission, Psylocke proved to be especially useful for the team as they fought Matsu'o Tsurayaba and the Hand. Psylocke's loyalty to the X-Men was put to the test when she pretended to be under Matsu'o's influence only to betray him and [[Arkady Rossovich (Earth-616)|Omega Red]], ruining their plans.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 5}}-[[X-Men Vol 2 7|7]]}}

Betsy travelled to England{{r|X-Men Vol 2 12}} to attend a party held by her brother Brian, now part of the British super-hero team, [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]]. The party was interrupted when Psylocke psychically felt [[Alysande Stuart (Earth-616)|Brigadier Sandy Stuart]] being murdered by her brother, Jamie, under orders of [[Opul Lun Sat-Yr-Nin (Earth-794)|Mastrex Opul Lun Sat-Yr-Nin]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 55}} With his recently discovered mutant powers, Jamie easily subdued Psylocke as he was mentally detached from reality. Since Meggan was immune to Jamie's powers, Psylocke managed to stab Jamie's brain with her psychic-knife, leaving the brother she adored in a catatonic state.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 56}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 32 0001.png|left|thumb|150px|Investigating her past]]

Back at the X-Mansion, Betsy was shown to be attracted to Cyclops. She started to flirt with her leader, attempting to seduce him.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 8}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 12}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 294}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 17}} The situation escalated when Betsy kissed him, suggesting an affair. Cyclops rejected her and claimed he was committed to Jean, who later questioned Psylocke in the Danger Room about the situation. Psylocke denied Jean's accusations and stabbed her with her psychic knife. Unexpectedly, Kwannon showed up, fought Psylocke and won, claiming that she was the real Elizabeth Braddock.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 20}} The X-Men couldn't confirm which woman was the real Betsy Braddock and went to Japan to meet [[Nyoirin Henecha (Earth-616)|Lord Nyoirin]], a crime lord who Kwannon claimed to be Psylocke's master. Little did this trip help in answering questions about Psylocke's true identity.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 21}}-[[X-Men Vol 2 22|22]]}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) and Warren Worthington III (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 319 0002.png|right|thumb|100px|With Archangel]]

Kwannon returned with the X-Men and joined the team as Revanche, causing immense discomfort between her and Psylocke in the team. Not long after, Revanche contracted the [[Legacy Virus]].{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 2 2}} Revanche had Tsurayaba kill her before the virus could, still in Psylocke's original body. As Revanche died, her telepathic powers reached their peak due to the infection, revealing the full truth about the body swap. She also absorbed all of her memories and her personality traits from Betsy's mind. Betsy lived, certain of her identity, but was trapped in Kwannon's body.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 31|32}} While Betsy went through this identity crisis, she got close to her fellow teammate, Warren Worthington III, a.k.a. Archangel.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 29}} Eventually, recognizing they had much in common as both had experienced radical changes, body and soul, they started a relationship.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 319}}

===Crimson Dawn===
Sabretooth, when kept captive in the X-Mansion, nearly killed Psylocke when she tried to protect [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boomer]] from him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 328}} Wolverine, Archangel, [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], and [[Gomurr (Earth-616)|Gomurr the Ancient]] used the mystical force of the [[Crimson Dawn]] to save Psylocke, imprinting on her face the mark of the Crimson Dawn, a red tattoo covering her left eye.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 329|330}} Her fighting and telepathic skills were enhanced, and she could now transport through and become one with shadows. The Crimson Dawn also changed Psylocke's personality profoundly as she grew more mysterious and distant from Warren and the other X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 338}} [[Kuragari (Earth-616)|Kuragari]], conqueror of the Crimson Dawn realm, attempted to corrupt Psylocke and turn her into his dread queen. Archangel and Psylocke defeated the tyrant and left the X-Mansion permanently, retiring from their activities as X-Men.{{r|{{cl|Psylocke and Archangel Crimson Dawn Vol 1 1}}-[[Psylocke and Archangel Crimson Dawn Vol 1 4|4]]}}

Assisting the X-Men, Psylocke was tricked by the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] into producing a psi-wave, removing all mutant telepathy and allowing him to control every mind on Earth. Although she should have died, Betsy's Crimson Dawn powers saved her once more. In a foolish mistake, the Shadow King expanded his powers too far which made his personal nexus exposed. Psylocke defeated the Shadow King, sacrificing her telepathy by keeping him trapped within her mind.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 77|78}}

===Death and Resurrection===
Following the [[Apocalypse: The Twelve|Twelve incident]], Psylocke developed robust telekinetic powers, a result of a powerset exchange with Jean Grey, who in turn acquired Psylocke's telepathy.{{r|Black Sun: Colossus and Nightcrawler Vol 1 1}} Without fine control over her new telekinetic abilities, she rejoined the X-Men, being immediately attracted to new member [[Neal Shaara (Earth-616)|Thunderbird]].{{r|Black Sun: Storm Vol 1 2}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 100|103}} Psylocke and Archangel tried to maintain their eroded relationship, even engaging in some adventures by themselves, such as fighting the [[Twisted Sisters (Earth-616)|Twisted Sisters]],{{r|X-Men Vol 2 105}} but eventually Archangel broke up with Psylocke after admitting their relationship had hit a dead end. After the break-up, Psylocke joined Storm's [[X-Treme X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Treme X-Men]] squad, started a relationship with Thunderbird. The new team left the Xavier Institute to search for [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny]]'s [[Destiny's Books|diaries]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 109}} 

When Brian started experiencing nightmares at Braddock Manor, Meggan called Betsy to help him. Brian confessed to his sister he had lost his confidence as Captain Britain. Before anything could be discussed, they learned from Captain UK that Roma had gone mad, threatening the Otherworld. There, Psylocke was imprisoned by the Warpies she once protected. Soon the Braddocks learned who was behind the attack: the computer Mastermind, who impersonated Roma and used the Warpies do gain control of the [[Sword of Might]] and the [[Amulet of Power]]. Psylocke broke free as Mastermind wasn't aware of her new telekinetic powers. With Mastermind defeated, Brian assumed the Otherworld's throne.{{r|{{cl|Excalibur Vol 2 1}}-[[Excalibur Vol 2 4|4]]}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) and Henry McCoy (Earth-616) from X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 2 0001.jpg|right|thumb|Psylocke's death]]

In [[Valencia]], Storm's X-Men were captured by the national police.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 1}} Psylocke was separated from the team with [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] and Rogue, when [[Vargas (Earth-616)|Vargas]] suddenly showed up intending to kill Rogue. The last one standing, Psylocke duelled Vargas to protect her friends, but was impaled through the chest by Vargas and ultimately killed.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 2}}

Months later, Psylocke mysteriously appeared out of the blue in the exact spot she died, without her Crimson Dawn tattoo. Storm's [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive (Earth-616)|X-Men squad]] was contacted to retrieve Psylocke and, after running numerous tests, it was proven Betsy was the real deal.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 455}} Initially, the X-Men were cautious of Psylocke's presence and kept her restrained, until they were attacked by the [[Hauk'ka]] and Psylocke joined forces with [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] to help the team on the Savage Land.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 456}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 459|459]]}} Joining Storm's X-Men, Psylocke was reunited with her friends in a changed world, where Cyclops and [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] ran the Xavier Institute, presumed dead teammates Colossus and [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Grey]] were alive, and Jean Grey had died.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 460}}

Psylocke experienced visions of her brother Jamie, leading her to form a friendship with Rachel Grey, who experienced the same visions. Jamie's machinations proved to be real when the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] rewrote the entire reality: though Rachel tried to protect herself and Betsy, Jamie forced them into the [[Earth-58163|new reality]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 462}} Then, Psylocke and Rachel were influenced into finding a reality breach that represented a threat to all existence,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 463|464}} which was fixed by Meggan's sacrifice.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 465}}

Jamie, confirming Betsy's suspicions, claimed he was responsible for her resurrection, needing her assistance against a group known as the [[Foursaken (Earth-616)|Foursaken]], led by the menacing [[First Fallen (Earth-616)|First Fallen]], a polar opposite of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]]. When resurrected, Psylocke became untrackable by telepathy or technology and was immune to reality-warping, being forged into the weapon Jamie needed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 472|473}} The Foursaken and the First Fallen were defeated by Psylocke, and Jamie's whereabouts were unknown after he apparently sacrificed himself to save her life.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 474}}

===Exiles===
[[File:Slaymaster (Earth-1720) and Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Exiles Vol 1 94 001.png|right|thumb|100px|Meeting the Slaymaster from Earth-1720]]
Immediately after [[M-Day]], Psylocke and other X-Men flew to London to help Captain Britain deal with the after-effects of the [[Decimation]] and the death of his wife. There, they were attacked by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-6141)|Charles Xavier]] and his five original [[Shadow-X (Earth-6141)|X-Men]] from [[Earth-6141|an alternate reality]], reforming the mutant group Excalibur.{{r|{{cl|New Excalibur Vol 1 1}}-[[New Excalibur Vol 1 3|3]]}} In another battle between Excalibur and these evil X-Men, Psylocke learned that Xavier was in fact the Shadow King, who was freed after her death. Psylocke confronted him, but was ripped from the time-stream{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 8}} by [[Heather McDaniel (Earth-3470)|Heather Hudson]], finding herself in the [[Panoptichron]], headquarters of the [[Exiles (Multiverse)|Exiles]]. There, she met an alternate version of [[Victor Creed (Earth-295)|Sabretooth]], a man she hated in her native reality. However, this Sabretooth proved to be a hero, and they quickly became close to each other. Recruited to the Exiles, Psylocke helped them save their teammates from a version of [[Hydra (Earth-1720)|Hydra]] led by [[Susan Storm (Earth-1720)|Susan Storm]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-1720)|Wolverine]].{{r|Exiles Vol 1 90|91}} During the mission, Psylocke had to face a version of one of her deadliest foes, the [[Slaymaster (Earth-1720)|Slaymaster]]. The Exiles finished their mission at the cost of Hydra escaping through the Multiverse.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 92|94}} As an Exile, Psylocke was integral in the group's restructuring as several members left to pursue their own lives elsewhere.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 95|100}}

Many of the Exiles had ties to [[Earth-616]] and decided to make a visit, meeting Excalibur at a party. The reunion was interrupted when Brian was wounded by [[Rouge-Mort (Earth-616)|Rouge-Mort]]. Psylocke took her brother and Excalibur to the Panoptichron where they noticed an attack in course against the Multiverse, carried out by Mad Jim Jaspers, now merged with the Fury. Psylocke learned Merlyn was behind the attacks. While Brian fought Jaspers, Psylocke struck against Merlyn, both defeating the villains. Psylocke decided to stay as a member of the Exiles, realizing how crucial was the job they did for the Multiverse.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Die by the Sword Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Men: Die by the Sword Vol 1 5|5]]}}

Psylocke and Sabretooth became co-leaders of the Exiles and engaged in an unresolved romantic relationship.{{r|{{cl|New Exiles Vol 1 1}}-[[New Exiles Vol 1 4|4]]}} The team was still being hunted by Hydra,{{r|New Exiles Vol 1 6}} Slaymaster being specifically interested in massacring alternate versions of Betsy across realities.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 94}} In one of their adventures, Psylocke led the Exiles to [[Earth-80827]]. Upon their arrival, Psylocke was possessed by remnants of [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-80827)|Lady Mandarin]], her alternate self from that reality who had just been killed by the Slaymaster. Psylocke met Lady Mandarin's master, [[Ogun (Earth-80827)|Ogun]], who trained her into becoming his new assassin, forging her into the warrior who would kill her aggressor.{{r|{{cl|New Exiles Vol 1 7}}-[[New Exiles Vol 1 10|10]]}} In a following mission, Psylocke finally faced the Slaymaster, but, before his defeat, he escaped again.{{r|New Exiles Vol 1 17}} She eventually slew him on the streets of Earth-616 [[London]], finally stopping his cross-reality massacre of her counterparts.{{r|X-Men: Sword of the Braddocks Vol 1 1}}

===Return to Earth-616===
[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) and James Howlett (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 510 001.png|right|thumb|Brainwashed by the Sisterhood]]
The Exiles disbanded, and Psylocke was found between dimensions by Madelyne Pryor's [[Sisterhood of Mutants (Earth-616)|Sisterhood]], who brought Betsy's original body from Kwannon's grave, transferring Betsy's mind back to it. Brainwashed, Psylocke assisted the Sisterhood in attacking the X-Men. However, she was able to resist her brainwashing, and was restored to her Asian body as her original body was fatally wounded by Dazzler. Psylocke rejoined the X-Men and Madelyne perished.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 508|511}} After her experience with the Sisterhood, Psylocke revealed she had regained her telepathy. She then traveled back in time with the [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]], to study the birth of mutantkind and find a way to reverse M-Day.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 512}} As the X-Club returned to the present, Psylocke helped them relocate the X-Men to the island of [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], as a reaction to [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s hunt for mutants on American soil.{{r|Utopia (Event)}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Psylocke Vol 1 4 0002.jpg|left|thumb|150px|On Utopia, at peace, after Matsu'o's death]]

Psylocke had to provide a second burial of her original body. She took her corpse back to [[Tokyo]], where it had been originally buried. At the cemetery, she was attacked by ninjas sent by Matsu'o Tsurayaba. She survived the attack and decided to put Matsu'o down for good.{{r|Psylocke Vol 1 1}} At his hideout mansion, Psylocke was impeded from reaching Matsu'o by [[Yukio (Earth-616)|Yukio]]. Knocking Yukio out, Psylocke met the [[Fahd Alireza (Earth-616)|Jinn]] who also wanted Matsu'o dead.{{r|Psylocke Vol 1 2}} They to another of Matsu'o's hideouts, where he was found him in miserable condition and revealed he had arranged for his own death.{{r|Psylocke Vol 1 3}} Throughout the years, Wolverine had gradually mutilated Matsu'o for his part in [[Mariko Yashida (Earth-616)|Mariko Yashida]]'s death. Matsu'o's attack on Psylocke was actually an elaborate suicide scheme. A violent confrontation between Psylocke and Wolverine occurred, and Wolverine eventually gave up fighting for Matsu'o's life. As Wolverine left, he mentioned Psylocke's recent death wish attitude. Psylocke finally put Matsu'o out of his misery by stabbing him with her psychic knife.{{r|Psylocke Vol 1 4}}

On Utopia, Psylocke was part of several X-Men missions and events. She witnessed the death of [[Yuriko Takiguchi (Earth-616)|Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi]], a dear friend to her;{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 515}} stood for Utopia against [[Predator X|Predators X]];{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 516|517}} assisted in a telepathic fight against a [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|Void]] fragment;{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 518|519}} teamed up with Wolverine, Colossus and [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]] to combat the [[Lobe's Team (Earth-616)|New U-Men]];{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 520|521}} confronted a newly resurrected [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]] on Muir Island;{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 231|233}} and was on the team responsible for retrieving and returning [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]] to Utopia, fighting [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]]'s [[Human Council (Earth-616)|Human Council]] in the process.{{r|Second Coming}}

===Uncanny X-Force===
[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 3 001.png|right|thumb|170px|Finding Apocalypse]]
After the [[Second Coming|return of Hope Summers]], Cyclops ordered the disbanding of [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]]. Wolverine disassembled the squadron, but turned to his closer allies to continue X-Force in secrecy. Psylocke joined the reformed X-Force with [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], Fantomex, and her former lover Archangel.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming Vol 1 2}} Betsy and Warren rekindled their relationship, as she was helping him to control his Death/Archangel persona. The team's first objective was to stop the resurrection of [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]], a personal interest for Archangel, who had been a [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horseman of Apocalypse]].{{r|Wolverine: Road to Hell Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 1}} The team battled [[Clan Akkaba (Earth-616)|Clan Akkaba]] and the Final Horsemen of Apocalypse on the Moon. Psylocke faced off [[Decimus Furius (Earth-616)|War]], who fell in love with her as Fantomex psychically manipulated him into it. This allowed her to get to Apocalypse's chambers, where she learned he was resurrected as a child, preventing her from killing him in cold blood. While X-Force debated Apocalypse's fate among themselves, Fantomex shot him dead, leaving the group profoundly affected and divided.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 2}}-[[Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 4|4]]}}

As one of their following tasks, X-Force learned the Reavers were back, now led by [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]]. Their intel suggested the Reavers planned on attacking Utopia. Psylocke was conflicted, not only because the Reavers were responsible for her entering the Siege Perilous, but also because she found herself elated by killing villains such as them. While the rest of X-Force battled the Reavers in the Australian Outback, Psylocke followed some of them who teleported to Utopia. There, she slaughtered them without being spotted by any of the X-Men, proving to be a true assassin.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 5.1}}

When Deadpool went missing during a recon mission at a military base in [[Tennessee (State)|Tennessee]], Psylocke and X-Force reencountered one of her worst enemies again: the Shadow King. Psylocke fought the Shadow King on the astral plane, while Fantomex protected her body, as he was immune to Shadow King's psychic influence. The Shadow King probed into X-Force's darkest secrets and learned about Apocalypse's assassination. He also telepathically freed Archangel, undoing all the work Psylocke went through with Warren.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 8}}

===[[Dark Angel Saga|Age of Archangel]]===
[[File:Warren Worthington III (Earth-616) and Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 14 001.png|right|thumb|Joining Archangel in hopes of saving him]]
Apocalypse's death triggered an ascension protocol within Warren to turn him into Archangel, the heir of Apocalypse. X-Force became aware of this after Warren tried to kill a reporter, to whom the Shadow King had delivered files on the secret team.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 10}} X-Force imprisoned Archangel in their headquarters, [[Cavern-X]], and traveled to the [[Earth-295|Age of Apocalypse]] under the direction of the [[Henry McCoy (Earth-295)|Dark Beast]], seeking to claim a [[Life Seed]] to counter the [[Death Seed]] within Warren. Initially, the group clashed with the [[X-Men (Earth-295)|X-Men]] from that universe, who regarded the Dark Beast a vile enemy. The conflict was de-escalated by Psylocke, who recognized Sabretooth from their time with the Exiles. Abandoned by Dark Beast, X-Force teamed up with the X-Men to claim a Life Seed and return to their world. During their time in the Age of Apocalypse, Psylocke and Fantomex shared a kiss, a result of a brief battle sparked by Fantomex, who accused Psylocke of being in a distant relationship with Warren. Unexpectedly, upon their return to their home reality, X-Force encountered Archangel, who had been freed by the Dark Beast and had Cavern-X overrun by Clan Akkaba.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 12|13}} X-Force was massacred by Archangel's forces, and Psylocke faced off with him personally, missing a hit on purpose since she was not capable of killing him. Betsy surrendered herself, hoping to appeal to whatever was left of Warren.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 14}}

[[File:Warren Worthington III (Earth-616) and Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 17 001.png|thumb|left|Brainwashed as Death]]
Archangel revealed his plan to Psylocke as they reached the [[Akkaba Metropolis]]. Using [[William Rolfson (Earth-616)|Genocide]] and the Doom Fountain, he would scour all life from the world, replacing it with new life grown from the Life Seed. As a test run, a small town in [[Montana]] was destroyed and regrown as [[Tabula Rasa (Location)|Tabula Rasa]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 15}} When X-Force led to the demise of the [[Sanjar Javeed (Earth-616)|Final Horseman of Death]], Archangel determined to replace him with Psylocke using a Death Seed gathered from the [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|Dreaming Celestial]].{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 16}}-[[Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 17|17]]}}

[[File:Warren Worthington III (Earth-616) and Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 18 0001.png|right|thumb|160px|Stabbing Warren with the Life Seed]]
The remaining X-Men from the Age of Apocalypse reality arrived to aid X-Force. The version of [[Jean Grey (Earth-295)|Jean Grey]] of that world managed to un-brainwash Psylocke after her psi-shields were downed when she was tricked into believing she had killed Fantomex. Jean's intervention expanded Psylocke's telepathic abilities immensely. Psylocke and Fantomex then fought Archangel to the death, with Psylocke stabbing Warren with the Life Seed and supposedly killing him. Betsy mourned for killing the love of her life, although Warren reappeared with no memory of who he was. Psylocke attempted to rekindle their relationship until realizing the person she loved was gone forever and only a tabula rasa remained.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 18|19}}

Following the [[Schism (Event)|schism]] between Cyclops' and Wolverine's factions of the X-Men, Psylocke remained both a member of X-Force, as an ally of Wolverine, as well as being assigned to a team in Utopia, as an ally of Cyclops.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Men Vol 3 20|37}} Tabula Rasa was still something to be attended to; for that purpose, Psylocke went to Cyclops' [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|X-Tinction Team]], which investigated the mysterious alien environment. During the mission, Magneto recognized that what happened in Tabula Rasa had the involvement of X-Force, a secret he was glad to share with Psylocke only.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 5}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 8|8]]}}

===The Battle for the Otherworld===
[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 20 0002.jpg|thumb|100px|As Lady Britain]]
After sending Warren to the Jean Grey School, Psylocke and Fantomex were kidnapped from Cavern-X by the [[Captain Britain Corps (Multiverse)|Captain Britain Corps]]. Psylocke was shocked to see her older brother Jamie alive and working with Brian at the Corps. The Braddock brothers confronted Betsy over her actions as a member of X-Force and, as Otherworld was being invaded by inter-dimensional forces, they offered her her original body and her inherited mantle as Lady Britain. Meanwhile, for killing the child Apocalypse, Fantomex was put on trial by the Corps, who used Brian's reformed psychic connection to his sister as evidence. Fantomex was sentenced to death by injection with an anti-reality serum.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 19|20}}

As Lady Britain, Psylocke rescued Fantomex from the Corps, and the fugitives went to the [[Forest of Sorrows]]. To save Fantomex from the anti-reality serum, Psylocke made a deal with [[Krokwel (Otherworld)|Krokwel]] giving up her ability to feel sorrow. Fantomex was safe for the moment, until they were ambushed by the [[Harry Pizer (Earth-616)|Skinless Man]]. Psylocke, Fantomex and the Skinless Man had a complicated history together: Fantomex caused the Skinless Man to be arrested by Otherworld's forces, where he was sentenced to have his skin removed by Psylocke's father. A vengeful Skinless Man ripped Fantomex’s face off. Psylocke intervened by apparently killing the Skinless Man. The duo then headed to assist X-Force, who were in the Otherworld fighting the inter-dimensional invasion while searching for their missing teammates.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 22}}

[[File:Brian Braddock (Earth-616) and James Braddock Jr. (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 23 001.png|left|thumb|Telepathically forcing Brian to kill Jamie]]
As Psylocke joined the fight, she learned that the leader of the invasion was a future version of Jamie. Betsy asked Brian to put their brother down, since millions of souls were being reaped by Jamie every second. As Brian refused to do so, Psylocke telepathically forced him to kill their brother in order to prevent this future from happening. As Jamie died, Betsy acknowledged that Brian knew how necessary what she had done was. Still, he chose Betsy as executioner while he remained a hero.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 23}} After Jamie's funeral, in need of feeling something, Betsy finally surrendered to Fantomex's romantic advances.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 24}}

===Final Execution===
After all that had happened, Psylocke decided to leave X-Force. At her apartment, she was kidnapped by the Shadow King, who was a member of a new [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], formed by several enemies of X-Force who learned about their activities. They kidnapped [[Evan Sabahnur (Earth-616)|Evan]], Apocalypse's clone created by Fantomex, and intended to force him to rise as the new Apocalypse. Shadow King telepathically tortured Psylocke until she was rescued by Fantomex, who gave her his telepathy-blocking hood, leaving himself vulnerable. He managed to send Psylocke away with [[E.V.A. (Earth-616)|E.V.A.]] before being killed by the Skinless Man.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 25|27}}

E.V.A. took Psylocke to Cavern-X, where [[Ultimaton (Earth-616)|Ultimaton]], who had reverted to his original programming of killing mutants after Fantomex's death, snapped Gateway's neck and self-detonated. Psylocke managed to send X-Force away by hacking into Gateway's teleportation powers.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 27}} X-Force was transported 30 years to a future where [[En Sabah Nur (Evan Sabahnur) (Earth-12928)|Evan]] had ascended as Apocalypse. [[Deathlok Prime (Earth-12928)|Deathlok]] explained that this forced [[James Howlett (Earth-12928)|Wolverine]] to assemble an X-Force team to kill the new Apocalypse. Led by Betsy, known as [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-12928)|Magistrate Braddock]], X-Force had killed all the world's criminals and telepathically tracked and terminated people before they committed crimes in a preventative manner.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 28}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 28 001.png|left|thumb|Psylocke's final execution]]
When Wolverine and X-Force from the present were unrepentant about this course of action, Deathlok attempted to kill them to prevent this totalitarian future from happening. He failed when he was destroyed by [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-12928)|Cable]]. Before being sent back by future X-Force, Psylocke escaped and resolved to prevent this future by killing Magistrate Braddock, her future self. She realized that this would not save the present, since she would still commit the same mistakes. To ensure Fantomex's sacrifice meant something, Psylocke carried on her final execution: suicide, by stabbing herself through the gut with her own katana.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 28}} Being interrupted by future [[Frank Castle (Earth-12928)|Punisher]] and Cable, Psylocke failed when she passed out and was saved by her team-mate [[Kurt Darkholme (Earth-295)|Nightcrawler]]. Healed from her injuries, Psylocke talked with her future self before returning to the present with X-Force.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 29}}

Back in the present, X-Force headed to [[Genosha]] to save Evan from the Brotherhood. As their first strike, Psylocke subdued [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] using her telepathy. X-Force argued about whether or not to kill Evan should he become Apocalypse.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 31}} Wolverine and Psylocke sneaked into the enemies' underwater base. Wolverine handled most of the enemies while Psylocke furtively searched for Evan and Deadpool. She was telepathically ambushed by the Shadow King and purposely gave herself temporary amnesia to escape the astral plane.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 32|33}} She then telepathically forced [[Omega White (Earth-616)|Omega White]] to absorb the Shadow King, leaving him trapped in a comatose body and freeing Evan's mind. Psylocke also decided not to claim the Shadow King's life, departing from the Brotherhood's base with X-Force and Evan. Leaving her katana behind as it sank into [[Hammer Bay]], Psylocke vowed never to kill again.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 34}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 34 001.png|right|thumb|Making a vow never to kill again]]
On Otherworld, Betsy reconciled with Brian. Back on Earth, she was met by Wolverine, who told her there was still one complication left unsolved with X-Force. They left in E.V.A. and met Deadpool at [[White Sky (Earth-616)|White Sky]] Headquarters, where Fantomex emerged from a cloning machine with two other Fantomexes: one of them villainous, called [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Jean-Phillipe) (Earth-616)|Weapon XIII]], who teleported away, and the other one a female called [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Cluster) (Earth-616)|Cluster]]. When Fantomex's body was found, all of his three brains were intact. E.V.A. wished to create a new body for him, but Deadpool operated the machine recklessly, generating an individual body for each of Fantomex's brains. Psylocke left with Fantomex and Cluster to meet [[Mother (Earth-616)|his mother]] in the [[French Alps]], where Psylocke and Fantomex shared a kiss, starting a new chapter of their lives without X-Force.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 35}}

===Fall of Utopia and a new X-Force===
In the war between the X-Men and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], Psylocke initially stood with the X-Men, personally facing off against [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]].{{r|AVX: Vs Vol 1 4}} During the initial conflicts, some X-Men were possessed by the Phoenix, becoming the [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]].{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 5}} Psylocke assisted the Phoenix Five in battling [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] in [[Sinister London]].{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 15}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 17|17]]}} However, as the Phoenix Five proved to be mentally and morally unstable, Psylocke left Utopia and supported the Avengers against the Phoenix.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 11}}

Betsy lived a frivolous life with Fantomex in [[Paris (France)|Paris]], where she was convinced to start thieving. However, Psylocke eventually realized that the man she fell in love was really torn in three, Cluster being the best part of him. The two women engaged in a romantic relationship, leaving a jealous Fantomex out of their private affairs. When performing a theft at the [[Louvre Museum]], Fantomex set Psylocke up, and some guards were killed as she escaped, much to her despair. Betrayed, Psylocke was cast out of Fantomex's life and went to the Jean Grey School.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 7}}-[[Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 9|9]]}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) and Rita Wayword (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 1 001.png|right|thumb|Striking at Spiral]]
Dismissed from teaching by Wolverine, due to her rage issues, Psylocke was assigned to a mission with Storm and [[Eugene Judd (Earth-616)|Puck]] concerning a drug dealer in [[Los Angeles|L.A.]]. The dealer was recognized as Spiral, and Betsy instinctively attacked her former oppressor. Meanwhile, Storm and Puck found a telepath girl named [[Ginny Guzman (Earth-616)|Ginny]], the "source" of Spiral's telepathic drug.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 1}} As Spiral teleported away with Ginny, the three heroes were interrupted by [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]], who returned from the future possessed by the [[Demon Bear (Earth-TRN342)|Demon Bear]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 2}} Psylocke, Storm and Spiral decided to rescue Ginny from Bishop, who kidnapped her. When Psylocke telepathically tracked and stabbed Bishop with her psychic knife, she found out his psyche was not only inhabited by the Demon Bear,{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 3}} but also with another presence, who possessed Ginny. As Ginny vanished, Psylocke decided to settle matters with Spiral for good, after many years of aggressions, but when push came to shove she decided to absolve Spiral.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 4}}

Psylocke probed into Bishop's mind in search of answers. She learned that the Demon Bear and the other presence, a [[Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-TRN342)|Ghost Owl]], had infiltrated Bishop's mind in the future. The Demon Bear was tearing Bishop's psyche apart. While Psylocke fought the Demon Bear on the astral plane, her body was stolen by Cluster,{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 5}} who expected Psylocke to rescue Fantomex from Weapon XIII. Psylocke was unexpectedly saved by Spiral, who confessed to Psylocke that she had been deprived from real relationships. Psylocke ultimately forgave Spiral, ending a long cycle of feuds between them. Back to the astral plane, Psylocke exorcised Bishop from the Demon Bear, incorporating it with her own powers.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 6}}

With Bishop safe, Psylocke decided to rescue Fantomex with Cluster. On Madripoor, they were ambushed by Weapon XIII's misdirection powers and were kept captive by him.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 7}} Weapon XIII was in love with Psylocke to the point of devotion, and she tricked him into believing she also wanted Fantomex dead.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 8}} She was brought to Fantomex, and they discussed their tumultuous relationship, but Weapon XIII intervened when Psylocke could not harm Fantomex. After the conflict was over, Cluster and Fantomex decided to be merged again, though Psylocke seemed not to be interested in maintaining their relationship anymore.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 9}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) and Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-TRN342) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 15 001.png|thumb|left|Killing Cassandra Nova in her original body]]
Bishop claimed that the terrible [[Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-TRN342)|Ghost Owl, a.k.a. the Revenant Queen]], planned to liberate an army of psychic doppelgängers known as [[Mummudrai|revenants]] in Los Angeles. The revenants hunted Bishop down, creating revenant versions of Psylocke, Storm, and Puck{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 10}} who were defeated. Spiral then revealed the Revenant Queen was a future version of [[Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-616)|Cassandra Nova]].{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 11}}-[[Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 12|12]]}} An uncanny formation of X-Force was reassembled to combat Nova as Los Angeles was trapped into a psychic prison. Cassandra Nova started a ritual to liberate the revenants, and Psylocke was captured, losing her control over the Demon Bear to Nova.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 13}} Nova recreated Psylocke's revenant as Betsy's original body and offered her her body back in trade for an alliance.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 14}} Trapped in the revenants' underworld, Psylocke sacrificed the Demon Bear to expel Nova from Ginny's body. Without a body of her own, Nova had no choice but to possess the body she created for Psylocke. Psylocke bonded Cassandra Nova to this new body, allowing her to physically kill Nova with her katana. Betsy not only broke her vow of not killing, but also lost the chance of having her original body back. As Nova died, her macabre ritual was undone.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 15}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 4 1 001.png|thumb|150px|right|At Jean Grey School]]
Psylocke eventually came back to the Jean Grey School, this time not as a teacher but as a security guard. She joined an all-female squadron led by Storm. This squad specifically dealt with diverse threats, such as artificial life-form [[Arkea (Earth-616)|Arkea]],{{r|X-Men Vol 4 1|3}} [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-13729)|a future version of the Brotherhood]],{{r|Battle of the Atom}} a new formation of the Sisterhood,{{r|X-Men Vol 4 7|12}} and [[Shogo Lee (Earth-616)|Shogo]]'s [[Future (Earth-616)|mysterious father]].{{r|X-Men Vol 4 13|17}} During this time, Psylocke also mentored a small group of students in Danger Room sessions.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 4 14}}-[[X-Men Vol 4 15|15]]}} Storm's team also helped [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] in dealing with [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]]{{r|X-Men Vol 4 18|22}} and fought dark versions of [[Krakoa III (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|X-Men Vol 4 23|26}}

===Back to killing===
Hope Summers, knowing Bishop was back in the present, went to Los Angeles seeking revenge. As they met, they were captured by [[Nathaniel Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]]. This led to a clash between Storm and Psylocke's X-Force and [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]]'s [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]]. Soon, the teams realized that they shared a common enemy in Stryfe, joining forces to free Hope and Bishop. Stryfe was defeated and the X-Force teams disbanded. Psylocke then sought out Cable and offered her services to his new X-Force initiative.{{r|Vendetta}} The new X-Force was put together after a mutant-related terrorist incident in [[Alexandria]] put Hope in a coma. Psylocke once again worked alongside Fantomex, though now she truly despised him. X-Force eventually had intel that an arms dealer named [[Yevgeny-Malevitch Volga (Earth-616)|Volga]] was behind the incident, since he created artificial mutants to serve him as weapons.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 1|2}} Contrary to her former vow, Psylocke had become addicted to killing as she grew more bloodthirsty, self-loathing, and broken by the day. Resorting to killing in X-Force was the only way she could feel anything at all.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 3}} Volga was apparently defeated revealing some of X-Force's secrets. Their newest member, MeMe, was actually Hope in disguise, something Betsy knew, but kept from her team-mates at Hope's request. Moreover, it was revealed that Cable died and was reborn in a cloned body on an daily basis,{{r|{{cl|X-Force Vol 4 4}}-[[X-Force Vol 4 6|6]]}} something that Psylocke saw as an escape for her tormenting and conflicting feelings{{r|X-Force Vol 4 7}} when they started a sexual relationship with no strings attached as he had only one night to live.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}

[[File:Charlies Cluster-7 (Earth-616) and Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 4 15 001.png|thumb|right|Downsizing Fantomex's ego]]
X-Force briefly met [[Peter Wisdom (Earth-616)|Pete Wisdom]]'s [[MI13 (Earth-616)|MI13]] in [[Afghanistan]], when Psylocke personally handled her sister-in-law Meggan. The two groups joined forces to defeat Volga's remaining forces. Wisdom told Cable and Psylocke about the Yellow Eye, an agency specialized on spying mutants.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 8|9}} X-Force chased the Yellow Eye on the track for Volga, but was betrayed by an insane Fantomex driven by his feelings of superiority. Fantomex held a personal grudge against Psylocke, since she rejected and diminished him. Using Volga's technology, he improved his body, easily overpowering Psylocke. As he was about to shoot her dead, he was knocked out by [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]], who had been in Yellow Eye's custody.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 11}} Psylocke then turned her attention to Yellow Eye's leader, who was revealed to be Mojo. Fantomex, surviving Domino's attack, emulated Archangel's powers to harass Psylocke.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 12}} X-Force escaped, and, back at their base, Psylocke broke down in tears in front of Domino due to the path of violence she had travelled.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 13}} Fantomex followed X-Force, and Psylocke used her psychic knife to downsize his ego, the source of his insanity. Once again, Psylocke decided not to claim her opponent's life.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 14|15}}

===Inhuman War===
In the wake of a massive anti-mutant uprising combined with the discovery that the [[Terrigen Mists]] spread in the atmosphere were harmful to mutants, mutants were on the brink of extinction again and were more hated and feared than ever. A desperate Magneto found a [[Warren Worthington III (Clone) (Earth-616)|mindless Archangel]] falling from the sky, something he believed to be a sign to reform the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 7}} His first recruit was Psylocke, who not only agreed with a more direct approach to the Terrigen crisis than Storm's [[X-Haven]], but was also interested in keeping track of Magneto's acts and tending to Archangel.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 12}} On their first mission, Magneto's X-Men investigated [[Someday Enterprises (Earth-616)|Someday Corporation]], that profited from mutants' despair, and fought the [[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Dark Riders]], who targeted mutant healers. During their fights, Psylocke telepathically kept this mindless Archangel on a leash, expecting to recover his memories in the process. Soon, Psylocke realized Magneto's ''modus operandi'' differed drastically from what she was used to, since he kept being overly secretive.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 1|5}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) and Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 14 001.png|left|thumb|As an ally to Magneto]]
Psylocke got a hint about what had happened to Archangel and asked for Magneto's help to go to [[Green Ridge]], [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]]. There, they found a wingless Warren, kept by Clan Akkaba, now led by Archangel's former lackey, Genocide.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 6|7}} As she investigated, Psylocke crossed paths with Fantomex, secretly on Magneto's payroll. There was still bad blood between them and they engaged in a fight. Psylocke preferred to knock him out rather than ally herself with him again. Then she learned that a choir of death formed by Archangel's clones had been created.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 8}} Gravely wounded by the choir, Psylocke called out for Archangel,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 9}} and he was fused with Warren again, obliterating the choir. Having Fantomex as a secret X-Man undermined Psylocke's relationship with Magneto even further; nevertheless she chose to stay with his X-Men to help Archangel.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 10}}

During the [[Civil War II|second super-human war]], Psylocke and Magneto had an additional conflict, as Magneto judged the inhuman [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses]] to be a threat to mutantkind and Storm's X-Men opposed his view, supporting [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] instead. Psylocke briefly left Magneto's X-Men and joined Storm's team. After the fight between the two factions of X-Men ceased, Psylocke confronted Magneto about she being merely one of his pawns rather than a true ally.{{r|{{cl|Civil War II: X-Men Vol 1 1}}-[[Civil War II: X-Men Vol 1 4|4]]}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) and Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 19 002.png|right|thumb|Killing Magneto]]
The last straw for Psylocke came to be when her team-mate [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|M]] revealed that she and Magneto were part of the Hellfire Club,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 11}} asking Psylocke to be their Black Queen. Though furious for being kept in the dark about Magneto's alliances with Fantomex, Mystique and now [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]], Psylocke still helped the Hellfire Club in attacking Someday Corporation, after they started weaponizing mutants.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 12}} Someday was dismantled, and Psylocke rejected the Hellfire Club's offer and left the X-Men. She warned Magneto that, though she believed in his methods, she would watch his actions as an avenging angel.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 13|14}} Acting solo for a while, Psylocke dealt with menaces to mutantkind, such as [[Omega Sentinel|Omega Sentinels]], [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]], and the [[Nasty Boys (Earth-616)|Nasty Boys]]. She was followed by Mystique on Magneto's orders, and her way of defeating and punishing Mystique was restoring her damaged psyche, curing her of her volatile personality.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 15}} With the ending of the war between the X-Men and the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]], Magneto's team of X-Men disbanded. Psylocke, knowing that Magneto worked to ignite the war, made good on her promise and killed him with her psychic katana after a violent combat in the Savage Land. She walked away alone, feeling the world and the X-Men were better off without both Magneto and her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 #19}}

===A Man called X===
Psylocke was in [[London]] when psychics all over the globe were targeted for death. She resisted the attack and sent a psychic call for help. Fellow X-Men who were relatively nearby went to her rescue, namely Bishop, Angel, Rogue, Gambit, and—though not directly invited—Fantomex, [[James Howlett (Earth-21923)|Old Man Logan]], and Mystique. These X-Men broke Psylocke free from a psychic trap woven by the Shadow King. She was urgent in sending the X-Men to the astral plane to destroy the Shadow King before he could complete his psychic incursion.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 1}} On the astral plane, the X-Men found Charles Xavier trapped by the Shadow King.{{r|{{cl|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 2}}-[[Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 4|4]]}} Meanwhile, in the physical world, the Shadow King possessed several people, creating an army of slaves. Psylocke was forced to guide Angel into freeing the Archangel persona, so he could detain the Shadow King's minions.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 5}} The X-Men seemingly killed the Shadow King on the astral plane and Charles Xavier returned to life in Fantomex's body, calling himself X and greeting a shocked Psylocke upon his return.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 6}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) and Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616) from Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 7 001.png|left|thumb|Leaving Fantomex on the astral plane]]
Psylocke looked for Fantomex on the astral plane, where he explained that he believed Xavier deserved to be back since he was a nobler man. Psylocke left the astral plane showing tenderness towards Fantomex after years of bearing a grudge. Back in the real world, the Shadow King's infection did not simply vanish as he died, since Proteus was freed by it.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 7}} Psylocke and X joined forces to reach Proteus. While Psylocke gave him the benefit of the doubt, X was adamant about killing him. This disagreement allowed Proteus to strike at them, merging their minds and body.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 8}} Psylocke only recovered herself by having Archangel as an anchor.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 9}} As the X-Men tried to stop Proteus from bringing the astral plane to the physical world, Psylocke and X telepathically destroyed him.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 10|11}} However, it was revealed that the Shadow King had hidden himself inside X's mind, and Psylocke led the X-Men to battle him again. As X recovered, he linked Psylocke's mind to those of all psychics in the world, expanding their telepathy and allowing Psylocke to repair the astral plane, while he killed off the Shadow King. X forced the X-Men to forget about his existence, but decided to let Psylocke know he was back and that he had a new dream.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 12}}

===Madripoor Mystery===
[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Hunt for Wolverine Mystery in Madripoor Vol 1 4 Spoiler Variant cover 001.jpg|thumb|right|Restored to her original body]]
When Wolverine's body disappeared from his final resting place,{{r|Hunt for Wolverine Vol 1 1}} [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] assembled a group of X-Women—including Psylocke—to confront Magneto in his base of operations in Madripoor, since they determined he was a potential suspect. The mutant heroines were ambushed by a local crime ring, [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]]'s [[Femme Fatales (Earth-616)|Femme Fatales]]. The psychic vampire [[Sapphire Styx (Earth-616)|Sapphire Styx]] absorbed the entirety of Betsy's soul at once, leaving her body dead.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor Vol 1 1}} Finding herself inside Sapphire Styx's mind, Betsy fought her way back with assistance from a fragment of Wolverine's soul the villainess had absorbed years earlier. Psylocke destroyed Sapphire Styx from the inside, and used the remaining soul power left behind to recreate her original body, molecule by molecule. Psylocke was finally herself again, no longer attached to Kwannon's destiny.{{r|{{cl|Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor Vol 1 3}}-[[Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor Vol 1 4|4]]}} She then rejoined the X-Men, returning to the Xavier Institute.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Dead Ends Vol 1 1}}

===[[Age of X-Man (Event)|Age of X-Man]]===
As a member of the X-Men, Psylocke grew close to Angel again. When the X-Men were caught amidst a riot ignited by [[James Madrox (Bartender) (Earth-616)|Jamie Madrox]], Psylocke and Angel helped to control the mob. Angel mysteriously vanished during the conflict, leaving Psylocke confused.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 1}} Madrox's actions were succeeded by unexplained phenomena the X-Men went to assess. In these missions, Psylocke constantly coordinated with Jean Grey telepathically.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 2}} Madrox's actions were orchestrated by [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]], who wanted to prevent an insane [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]] from rewriting the reality using the Life Seed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 3|4}} 

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 5 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|175px|thumb|Psylocke vs. Angel]]
Psylocke recognized Angel was one of Nate Grey's [[Horsemen of Salvation (Earth-616)|Horsemen of Salvation]] after they destroyed the X-Mansion. To free Angel from Nate Grey's control, Psylocke did the unimaginable: she once again freed Archangel from the depths of his mind, ruining their relationship forever.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 5|6}} Psylocke then sent Bishop to the inside of Legion's psyche to save some of the New X-Men, who were trapped there with Nate Grey. However, her actions freed Nate Grey, who now had control over Legion's body and powers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 8}} During the fight, Psylocke and a resentful Archangel teamed up to liberate Storm from being a Horseman of Salvation. Then, Psylocke linked a large group of telepaths to down Nate Grey's defenses, allowing Jean Grey to reach him. As a result, he created a pocket reality as he had originally planned, bringing dozens of X-Men with him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9|10}}

In this new reality, everyone on Earth was a mutant and any intimate relationships were strongly discouraged or illegal. Psylocke was a member of [[Department X (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Department X]], the police force in charge of investigating and arresting dissident mutants. Psylocke and her team, for example, arrested X-Man Bishop for engaging in a forbidden relationship with Marvel Girl.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}} Some time later, Department X was tasked with capturing love criminals [[Luke (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Luke]] and [[Nezumi Sen (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Nezumi Sen]]. Nezumi revealed that she was pregnant, something for which they did not have a protocol to follow. Psylocke used her psychic powers to confirm the pregnancy, leaving the group shaken by the situation.{{r|Age of X-Man: X-Tremists Vol 1 1}}

Department X caused the controlled burning of a nearby woodland, giving the X-Men a catastrophe to manage on this fabricated world. Later, while working alone together, Psylocke confronted the [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]] about his feelings toward her, offering to erase them, which he refused. Psylocke confronted the Blob at his home where she shared an intimate memory with him.{{r|Age of X-Man: The Marvelous X-Men Vol 1 2}}{{r|Age of X-Man: X-Tremists Vol 1 2}} Psylocke started to question Department X's activities. As she detained another criminal mutant, she pretended to wipe his memories, being backed by the Blob. They started to share relaxing moments together in secrecy, commiserating over their feelings for one another.{{r|Age of X-Man: X-Tremists Vol 1 3}} With Blob's support, Psylocke released all the trapped love memories of those they had imprisoned, terminating her connection to Department X.{{r|Age of X-Man: X-Tremists Vol 1 5}} When Nate Grey returned all the mutants to their mainstream identities, Psylocke and Blob were together.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

[[File: Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Excalibur Vol 4 1 001.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Long live Captain Britain!]]
Much radically changed for Betsy with the establishment of the mutant nation on the island of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], where all mutants were granted citizenship. Eventually, she decided to move to the island, after a period living with her family at the [[Braddock Academy]]. Since Betsy learned Kwannon returned to her original body, she gave up her Psylocke identity, as it had been attached to the image of the woman whose body she stole. Kwannon's return was not the only one that shocked Betsy: through Krakoan [[Resurrection Protocols]], her older brother Jamie also came back to the living. Another shadow from Betsy's past was Apocalypse, a member of the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoan government]], who had a special interest in accessing the Otherworld and sought for Betsy's help. Simultaneously, Captain Britain, who was aware that the Otherworld faced a crisis, was contacted. The Braddock twins traveled to [[Avalon]], where they were attacked by [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]]. Brian fell under Morgan's control, and Betsy reassumed the mantle of Captain Britain after claiming her brother's Amulet of Power.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 1}}

Captain Britain was brought back to Krakoa by a group assembled by Apocalypse, formed by Rogue, Gambit and Jubilee. They went to the ruins of the [[Braddock Lighthouse]], a beacon to the Otherworld.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 2}} Unsuccessful, the group returned to Earth, without Brian.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 3}} Upon their return, the British Crown recognized Betsy as the official new Captain Britain, sending Pete Wisdom to act as her contact. Betsy extended her position to her colleagues, recreating Excalibur as the official liaison between the UK, Krakoa and the Otherworld. As a consequence, Captain Britain became a target to the reformulated Coven Akkaba, now an anti-mutant organization with ties to Morgan le Fay and the Otherworld.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 4}} 

[[File:Excalibur Vol 4 1 Textless.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Captain Britain reassembles Excalibur as a result of Apocalypse's machinations]]
As one of her first actions, Captain Britain had Excalibur to protect Britain from being invaded by beasts from the Otherworld, as its barriers were weakened.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 4}} With the invasion escalated, Apocalypse completed his ritual to invade Morgan's castle in Camelot. Excalibur realized he had manipulated them to fall into a combat against Morgan, since he had previously planned for a mutant Captain Britain and a mutant-ruled Avalon. Apocalypse ultimately arranged for the conflict to be solved by a duel of champions for the Kingdom of Avalon: Betsy, for Krakoa, versus Brian, for Morgan. In a brutal fight, the new Captain Britain accidentally slew her brother. Triumphant, Apocalypse appointed Jamie as Avalon's monarch. Betsy also demanded that Jamie resurrect Brian. Though Betsy assumed Brian would step back as Captain Britain, he refused to since he had succumbed to Morgan's influence. Betsy Braddock was now the true and only Captain Britain.{{r|{{cl|Excalibur Vol 4 5}}-[[Excalibur Vol 4 6|6]]}}

Apocalypse then assigned Excalibur to retrieve [[Warwolves|Warwolf]] carcasses to complete a ritual that would allow him to spy on the Starlight Citadel. Excalibur tracked the remaining Warwolves, clashing with [[Cullen Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Cullen Bloodstone]], who had bought the beasts, though the Warwolves were eventually claimed by Excalibur.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 7|8}} Excalibur reached the Starlight Citadel, and Betsy earned the immense aversion of its ruler, her former ally Saturnyne.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 9}} Saturnyne's priestesses fought back, but Excalibur managed to invade the Starlight Citadel where they planted a [[Gateways|Krakoan gateway]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 11}} In the Starlight Citadel, Saturnyne and Captain Britain discussed the past and the future of the Captain Britain Corps.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 12}}

Apocalypse's true motivations for opening the gates to the Otherworld were revealed: he wished to be reunited with his [[Genesis (Earth-616)|wife]] and children, who long ago had left for the hellish dimension of [[Amenth]] with [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]]. Unexpectedly, Apocalypse's children betrayed him and planned to invade and consume Krakoa, being led by [[Annihilation (Earth-616)|Annihilation]]. Saturnyne, facing an imminent conflict in her dominions, set off a [[X of Swords|tournament]], with ten swords from each land: Krakoa and Arakko. When the prophecy for the tournament was recited, Betsy's name was listed among the [[Swordbearers of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Swordbearers of Krakoa]].{{r|X of Swords: Creation Vol 1 1}} The first phase of the tournament comprised collecting the ten swords, and the three Braddock siblings visited the Starlight Citadel to retrieve Betsy's sword. Saturnyne desired to have Brian back as the champion of a reformed the Captain Britain Corps. Knowing this, Betsy and Brian pretended to fight over Captain Britain's mantle, tricking Saturnyne into crafting the [[Starlight Sword]] for Brian after Betsy destroyed the Amulet of Power. Betsy stole the sword and joined the tournament as Captain Britain.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 13}}

[[File:Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Excalibur Vol 4 14 001.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Shattered to pieces]]
Captain Britain's first and only challenge was against an Arakki opponent, [[Isca (Earth-616)|Isca the Unbeaten]]. Surprisingly, as a result of a spell cast by Saturnyne, Betsy was shattered in pieces in the middle of the battle.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 14}} Saturnyne intended to recreate the Captain Britain Corps with the spell, but when she reassembled Captain Britain's pieces she was horrified to see Betsy instead of Brian as her champion. Her spell brought several alternate versions of Betsy to help the X-Men fight the forces of Amenth.{{r|X of Swords: Destruction Vol 1 1}}

===Otherworld War===
With the Corps reassembled, Betsy's spirit bounced between realities, ultimately being switched with an alternate version of herself: [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-TRN904)|Queen Elizabeth III]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 16}} With [[Earth-TRN904|that reality]]'s [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-TRN904)|Angel]]'s and [[Kwannon (Earth-TRN904)|Kwannon]]'s help, Betsy managed to return to the Othwerworld.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 17}} At the Braddock Lighthouse, a cloned body created by her brother Jamie was possessed by an unknown usurper, attracting the attention of Excalibur and Psylocke.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 18}} As her spirit was retrieved by [[Elspeth Braddock (Earth-13059)|Elspeth Braddock]], the Captain Britain Corps sought for Excalibur's help in returning her spirit to her body. As a resurrection ritual performed by Rictor failed, Psylocke set Betsy's spirit free and hunted her mind in Avalon. As the two women met, they finally had the opportunity to talk about their sorrowful connection. As Psylocke offered to host her psyche, Betsy was fully resurrected. Soon after she returned, Excalibur learned her body had been previously possessed by Malice.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 19}} Captain Britain and Psylocke, with newfound sympathy for Malice's situation, tracked her down on Krakoa and fought her in a telepathic battle that ended with Malice's death. Malice was revived by the [[Five (Earth-616)|Five]] in her original body, having a second chance at life.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 20}}

[[File:Merlyn (Otherworld) and Excalibur (Earth-616) from Excalibur Vol 4 22 cover.jpg|thumb|175px|left|At Merlyn's mercy]]
During the [[Hellfire Gala]], one of Coven Akkaba's highest ranking members, [[Reuben Brousseau (Earth-616)|Reuben Brousseau]], was revealed to have become an ambassador for the British government, being able to reject Krakoa's sovereignty and Captain Britain's legitimacy as a British representative. With Excalibur no longer welcome in Britain, Rictor reshaped the Braddock Lighthouse as the [[Braddock Isle]], no longer attached to Great Britain.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 21}} In Otherworld, however, Captain Britain was reluctantly accepted by Saturnyne to take care of diplomatic affairs. Initially sent to the [[Holy Republic of Fae]], Excalibur was tasked to check on Merlyn, who had been acting dengerously antagonistic after losing his position at the Starlight Citadel to Saturnyne. Although briefly imprisoned, Excalibur escaped Merlyn's clutches.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 22}} 

Upon her return to the Braddock Isle, Captain Britain was approached by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], who wished to access Otherworld. In an unusual team-up, Doom was escorted by Captain Britain to the [[Valley of Wailing Mists]], where they found [[Castle Le Fay]] missing. The shrunken castle was located in Mad Jim Jaspers' [[Crooked Market]], where Doctor Doom and Excalibur were attacked by an army of mutant-killing Furies. Overcoming the fight and with Doctor Doom's gratitude, Captain Britain started to link the recent hostilities against Avalon to Merlyn's intentions.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 23}} Her investigation led her to realize that Merlyn had been damaging the opinion about mutants among Otherworld's courts in order to undermine Saturnyne's rule. His plan was made explicit when he approached the Starlight Citadel accompanied with an army led by [[Arthur Pendragon (Earth-616)|King Arthur]], Avalon's former ruler and father of the erratic mutant [[Mordred (Earth-616)|Mordred]]. With no other option, Excalibur went to battle against Merlyn's forces fighting for the right of mutants to be in Otherworld.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 24}}

| Powers = Betsy Braddock is a powerful [[Homo superior|mutant]] psychic, manifesting a vast and ever-changing set of telepathic and telekinetic abilities throughout the years. In addition to being a psychic, she was also granted [[Captain Britain]] powers in different moments of her life.

'''Telepathy:''' Betsy developed her mental powers to interact with, affect and manipulate the minds of other sentient beings over long distances.{{r|Daredevils Vol 1 3}} When she makes use of her telepathy a large butterfly-like image is usually cast by her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 213}}
*'''Psionic Knife:''' Described as "the focused totality of her psychic powers", by intensely channeling and focusing her psionic powers to her hands, Betsy creates “psychic blades”, razor-sharp edges of pure mental energy which she plunges into the minds of her targets directly. Betsy often uses them to disrupt the neurons of her foes by driving the glowing blade of mental energy into their skulls.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 257}} It is able to kill.{{r|Psylocke Vol 1 4}}
*'''Psionic Blasts:''' Capable of projecting psionic force bolts which can affect a victim's mind causing them pain, confusion, unconsciousness, or even death.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 6}}
*'''Astral Projection:''' Ability to project her astral form from her body onto astral planes or the physical plane.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 212}} On the astral plane, she can mentally create psionic objects and manipulate the aspects of her environment.{{r|New Mutants Annual Vol 1 2}}{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 8}} Under the effects of the Crimson Dawn her astral form was normally undetectable.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 78}}
*'''Psionic Shadow:''' Ability to mask her presence from others. Her abilities can go undetected and are very difficult to track, even by very powerful telepaths such as [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]]. She can extend these defenses to others around her as well.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 31}}
*'''Telepathic Illusions:''' Ability to create elaborate illusions to make herself seem to be invisible, look like someone else, or fabricate experiences and events that are not truly happening.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 239}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 512}}{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 18}}{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 31}}
*'''Mind Control:''' Capable of controlling the minds of others.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 217}}

*'''Precognition:''' Betsy's psychic abilities originally manifested as precognitive dreams.{{r|Daredevils Vol 1 3}} She was able to predict her brother Brian would be attacked by [[Willard Scott (Earth-616)|Lord Hawk]]{{r|Captain Britain Vol 1 34}} and that the Reavers would kill her and her X-Men teammates.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 250}} It is unknown if this ability remains in the present.

'''Telekinesis:''' Ability to psionically manipulate and control the physical aspects of matter, allowing her to move and levitate objects and living beings. Although she can move objects from a distance and fly as other telekinetics do, she has shown little inclination to do either in combat situations. Her telekinesis are described to be robust, in the sense she found that using her telekinesis in forceful ways was easier than in a delicate, fine manner. However, over time she displayed further control over fine matter.
*'''Flight:''' She can personalize her telekinetic abilities in such a way to propel herself through the air at variable speeds.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 103}}
*'''Force Fields:''' Capable of creating telekinetic shields of all sizes to deflect/decelerate incoming attacks.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 105}} She can also alter their sizes and strengths.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 471}}
*'''Concussive Blasts:''' Besides flight and force fields, she can fire telekinetic blasts that are capable of pushing back the X Men and Wolverine
*'''Telekinetic Weapons:''' Betsy's telekinesis has great versatility, as she has used it to construct psionic weapons that damage a target either physically, mentally or both at some point. She showed skill in using creating multiple types of psionic weapons that differ in size and power which she uses in combat.
**'''Telekinetic Sword/Katana:''' Betsy can manifest a telekinetic sword composed of raw psi-energy at will,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 100}} which at its lowest intensity functions to disrupt neural pathways, and at its highest level, her swords can slice an armored opponent and cut through their armor, but leave the attacker physically unharmed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 456}} Her telekinetic manifestations produce visible radiance in the physical world, which can be used as a makeshift light source in areas of darkness. Her telekinetic sword is strong enough to harm other beings more powerful than herself.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 472}} When in Kwannon's body, her sword usually manifested as a katana.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 100}} After returning to her original body, she produced a sword more similar to a European knight's sword in its fashion, often used with a telekinetic shield.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 1}}
**'''Telekinetic Crossbow:''' As of late, Betsy has been showing even more versatility when it comes to her psionic constructs. She has been seen creating psi-bows and arrows.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 1}}
**'''Telekinetic Spiked Flail:''' She once manifested a psionic spiked flail which she used to destroy a wall.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 6}}
<!-- CITATION NEEDED: **'''Telekinetic Claws:''' As an extension of her psionic constructs she is able to create claws like X-23's but made of pure psionic energy which can affect the target physically, and also to slice through armor.{{Citation}} -->

*'''Telekinetic Invisibility:''' She showed the ability to use her telekinesis to render herself invisible by modifying her molecular structure.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 92|93}}

'''[[Immutability|Reality Anchoring]]:''' Betsy's brother, Jamie Braddock, had altered her at a quantum level in order to make her more resilient to the multiversal entity called [[First Fallen (Earth-616)|The First Fallen]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 473}} His changing of her personal being gave her immunity to magic, psionics, and alterations to the space-time continuum, as well as imperceptibility to similarly empowered beings.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 474}}

'''Otherworlder:''' As a half-Otherworlder, she manifests powers granted by that status.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 7}}

'''Crimson Dawn:''' After being nearly beaten to death by Sabretooth and being saved by being exposed to the Crimson Dawn until her actual death by the hands of Vargas, Psylocke mysteriously manifested a unique set of abilities.

*'''Shadow Teleportation:''' While empowered by the [[Crimson Dawn]], Psylocke could use shadows as teleportation gates.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 338}} Although this form of teleportation was not as controlled or precise as variations of teleportation used by others, it could cover huge distances; on one occasion she transported the X-Men from America to Africa in a few seconds.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 77}}

*'''Enhanced Physiology:''' After her exposure to the Crimson Dawn, Psylocke was left far more physically sharp than she had ever been, something that improved her fighting skills immensely.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 333}} It is unknown if such augmentations in her physical condition were lost after her resurrection.

'''Invisibility to electronic detection devices:''' Psylocke was invisible and immune to all manner of electronic tracking and tracing before going through the Siege Perilous.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 229}} This ability did not carry over, though through Jamie's actions she is undetectable by certain cosmic entities and their machinations (such as the [[Crystal Palace]]'s systems).{{r|Exiles Vol 1 91}}
}}

| Abilities               = '''Master Martial Artist:''' Originally, Betsy had advanced training as a fighter from S.T.R.I.K.E. As an X-Man, she was taught in combat in constant training sessions with Wolverine and other X-Men. After swapping bodies with Kwannon, she acquired all the fighting knowledge the Asian assassin had, being classified as a master martial artist, though the specific fighting arts she had mastered have never been revealed. Presumably, as a ninja, she is skilled in various ninjutsu techniques. Even though she is known as a ninja and worked for [[The Hand (Earth-616)|The Hand]] as one, her fighting skills and techniques far surpass those of the average Hand Ninja{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 257}} or [[Crimson Dawn]] Undercloak.{{r|Psylocke and Archangel Crimson Dawn Vol 1 2}} Her skills have been said to rival those of a ninja grandmaster (10th Dan level black belt or above).{{r|Psylocke and Archangel Crimson Dawn Vol 1 3}} As an Exile, Betsy has also received additional training from [[Victor Creed (Earth-295)|Sabretooth]]{{r|New Exiles Vol 1 11}} and [[Ogun (Earth-80827)|Ogun]] that vastly developed her skills in this area.{{r|New Exiles Vol 1 9}} She is also very well versed in the use of all ninja weapons, stealth methods, silent movement, infiltration, concealment, escape & evasion, covert methods, ninja espionage, and ninja acrobatics.

'''Master Telepathic Combatant:''' As a telepath, Betsy takes advantage of her powers in a fight by reading her opponents' movements seconds before they make them, giving her the opportunity to counter-attack faster.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 257}} She can also use her telepathy to mask her presence from other people, humans and super-humans alike.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 1}} She can create telepathic illusions to distract her enemies while fighting them{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 259}} and as a ninja, she uses her psychic knife to incapacitate her opponents without killing them,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 257}} though she has fewer inhibitions about doing so and will if necessary.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 2 2000}}

'''Advanced Telekinetic Combatant:''' As a telekinetic, she often uses her powers to augment her strength and speed,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 103}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 105}} which made her fighting skills so strong that she was able to match and even outmatch other superhumanly strong opponents like a holographic version of Sabretooth in the Danger Room.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 103}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 460}}

'''Trained Pilot:''' Betsy worked as a charter pilot, being experienced in controlling airplanes.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 1 8}} On several occasions, she was tasked of piloting the [[X-Men Blackbird]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 17}}

| Strength                = Betsy possesses the normal human strength of a woman her age, height, and build who engages in intensive regular exercise. She can increase her strength by bolstering it with her telekinetic ability.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 91}}

<!-- UNREFERENCED CLAIM:| Weaknesses              = '''Power Limitation:''' The downside of her new powers is that the strength of her telepathic and telekinetic powers depend on how much she is using the other. Using two powers at once makes it hard for her to focus and lowers their level of power. For instance, if she is using her telekinesis, her telepathy is limited to only reading and broadcasting thoughts and, at the time, she is unable utilize her other telepathic skills. Aside from this, her previous resistance to both reality manipulation and telepathy seemed to diminish after the Red Queen's manipulation and she can now be detected by electronic devices.

| Equipment               = * '''[[Captain Britain's Uniform]]:''' As Captain Britain, Betsy wears a costume that provides her several abilities.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 12}}{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 20}}{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 1}} Betsy's uniform appears to be cast only when she is in possession of either the Amulet of Power (currently destroyed) or the Starlight Sword.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 13}} Betsy's first Captain Britain uniform was originally worn by [[Byron Bra-Dhok (Earth-794)|Kaptain Briton]].{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 13}}

** '''Superhuman Durability:''' As Captain Britain, it seems Betsy manifests enhanced durability.{{r|X of Swords Handbook Vol 1 1}} She was able to jump from the top of the Braddock Lighthouse falling several meters to the ground with no injuries.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 2}} Assuming she manifests similar abilities her brother did when wearing Captain Britain's uniform, it might be assumed this is due to the uniform emitting a surrounding force field over her body.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes (UK) Vol 1 378}}

The Starlight Sword was crafted from a piece of the [[Starlight Citadel]], made of an unknown material. The wielder of the sword steps into the role of Saturnyne's champion of the Otherworld.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 13}}
* Psylocke owned a katana named [[Shurayuki]], that was forged in [[Japan]] a thousand years ago and given to her by an unrevealed friend.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 1}} She used to telekinetically charge her katana with psionic energy.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 1}} It is unknown if Betsy kept her katana after returning to her original body.

| Notes                   = 
* Psylocke and Wolverine have shared a psychic bond.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 257}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 6}}
* Psylocke was stated to be the third most powerful telepath on [[Earth]] (without counting [[Nathaniel Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]]).{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 17}}
| Trivia                  = 
* Creator [[Chris Claremont]] once stated that Psylocke was turned Asian for the [[Acts of Vengeance]] story arc only, but, after a good response from the audience to [[Jim Lee]]'s design for Asian Psylocke, he decided to keep going with the redesign.<ref>[https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-legends-revealed-536/ Comic Book Legends Revealed #536]</ref>
* Psylocke originally had her own body transformed into an Asian body rather than having her mind transferred to the body of an Asian woman. X-Men writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] declared he misinterpreted the original story during his research, resulting in the creation of Kwannon.<ref>[https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-legends-revealed-363/3/ Comic Book Legends Revealed #363]</ref>
* Psylocke's return to her original body could have happened many years prior her actual comeback. Writer Chris Claremont intended to have her resurrected in her original body in his [[X-Treme X-Men Vol 1|X-Treme X-Men]] series, which ended in 2004, but the editorial staff had several restrictions for characters returning from death back then. This would change a few years later, when [[Joss Whedon]] was allowed to resurrect Colossus in [[Astonishing X-Men Vol 3|Astonishing X-Men]], paving way for Claremont to bring Psylocke back, though he kept her in her Asian body.<ref>[https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-legends-revealed-397/ Comic Book Legends Revealed #397]</ref>
* [[Uncanny X-Force Vol 1|Uncanny X-Force]]'s writer [[Rick Remender]] stated in interview that Psylocke's powerset consisted of her being a "burgeoning Omega-level telepath", with no mention of her telekinetic abilities.<ref>[https://www.cbr.com/x-position-rick-remender-2/ CBR interview (X-Position)]</ref> In his stories, Psylocke was never seen using telekinesis.
* Curiously, Psyche, the Greek goddess of the soul, is usually portrayed with a butterfly hovering over her head, similar to the butterfly effect Psylocke manifests when using her telepathic powers.{{r|wikipedia:Psyche (mythology)}}{{r|wikipedia:Cupid and Psyche}}
* The name "Psylocke" ([ˈsaɪ.lɑːk] SEYE-lok) is assumed by some fans to be a wordplay with the words "psyche", "key" and "lock". As "psyche" is pronouced as "psy-key", "Psylocke" would be pronounced as "psy-lock".
