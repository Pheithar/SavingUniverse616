===Origin===
[[File:Klaus Voorhees (Earth-616) from Journey into Mystery Vol 1 98 0003.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Klaus Voorhees]] Klaus Voorhees was an ex-convict working with the humanitarian medical researcher [[Ezekiel Shecktor (Earth-616)|Professor Ezekiel Shecktor]] in [[India]] on a universal antitoxin for snake venom. Jealous of Shecktor's success, Voorhees plotted to kill him and make the murder look like an accident. Hence, Voorhees induced one of the cobras kept in the laboratory to bite both Shecktor and himself. Voorhees planned to use the universal antitoxin to save himself from death. Unknown to Voorhees, the cobra had been irradiated. The combination of the radioactive venom in his bloodstream and the experimental anti-toxin which he used created a mutagenic catalyst which gave Voorhees certain cobra-like powers.{{r|Journey Into Mystery #98}}

===Thor===
Assuming the costumed guise of the Cobra, Voorhees used his new found superhuman abilities for crime. Cobra travelled back to the [[United States of America|United States]], initially defeating [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] in their first encounter but Thor escaped after returning to Don Blake. The Cobra then went to the offices of [[Basil Andrews (Earth-616)|Dr. Bruce Andrews]] and kidnapped [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Jane Foster]] climbing out of the window. Assuming he defeated Thor, he let his guard down which allowed Thor to strike. Cobra dropped Jane and escaped as Thor saved her life.{{r|Journey Into Mystery #98}}

===Teaming Up with Mr. Hyde===
Cobra began his long time partnership with another of Thor's adversaries, [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mister Hyde]]. But the team of the Cobra and Mister Hyde were defeated repeatedly, first by Thor{{r|Journey into Mystery #105|106}}{{r|Journey into Mystery #110|111}} and later by the costumed crime fighter [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]]. Hyde and Cobra were among the many costumed menaces assembled by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] to disrupt the wedding of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] and [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Susan Storm]].{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 #3}}

Hyde and the Cobra next battled Daredevil.{{r|Daredevil #30|32}} He then teamed with the original [[Jonathan Powers (Earth-616)|Jester]] and Mr. Hyde against Daredevil.{{r|Daredevil #61}} 

Teaming with the Mr. Hyde again, Cobra attempted to acquire [[Cagliostro (O-Bengh) (Earth-616)|Cagliostro]]'s serum.{{r|Daredevil #142|143}}

He was next employed by the [[Zebediah Killgrave (Earth-616)|Purple Man]], and battled Daredevil in an arena alongside Mr. Hyde, the Jester, and the [[Melvin Potter (Earth-616)|Gladiator]].{{r|Daredevil #153}}

===Serpent Squad===
Cobra served as a lead of the [[Serpent Squad (Cobra) (Earth-616)|Serpent Squad]] with the [[Leopold Stryke (Earth-616)|Eel]] and the first [[Jordan Dixon (Earth-616)|Viper (Jordan Dixon)]]. With the Serpent Squad, he attacked [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and the [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]].{{r|Captain America #163}} He subsequently joined the second [[Serpent Squad (Madame Hydra) (Earth-616)|Serpent Squad]] led by [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper (Madame Hydra)]] after Jordan Dixon's death. They battled Steve Rogers in his [[Nomad]] identity, and then became involved in an attempt to raise the continent of [[Lemuria (Deviant)|Lemuria]].{{r|Captain America #180|182}} He became trapped with the second Viper, and his cowardice earned her enmity.{{r|Captain America #184}}

===The Raft===
The Cobra came to believe that his criminal career would fare more successfully if he no longer acted in partnership with Hyde. Hence, when the Cobra made an escape from prison on [[Ryker's Island]] in [[New York City|New York]], he refused to free Hyde, who was also imprisoned there, despite Hyde's pleas. Infuriated, Hyde vowed vengeance and has since made attempts on the Cobra's life.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #46}}
 
===Serpent Society===
After operating independently for a time, Voorhees accepted an invitation to join the [[Serpent Society (Earth-616)|Serpent Society]] formed by [[Seth Voelker (Earth-616)|Sidewinder]].{{r|Captain America #310}} When Sidewinder retired, Voorhees changed his codename to King Cobra and became the leader of the criminal organization.{{r|Captain America #367}}

Hyde briefly helped the symbiote-bonded [[Patrick Mulligan (Earth-616)|Toxin]] track Cobra after a prison escape by providing a piece of skin for the symbiote to track.{{r|Toxin #1}}

===Secret War===
King Cobra was recruited by [[Lucia von Bardas (Earth-616)|Lucia von Bardas]] to attack [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] and a group of heroes who were involved in a [[Secret War]] in [[Latveria]] a year earlier. The hired mercenaries were each a component of a bomb designed to destroy the city. Fury and his team were able to stop them and arrested them all including Cobra.{{r|Secret War Vol 1 5}}

===Thunderbolts===
After the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] passed, Cobra was forced to join the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] and was trained by [[Andreas von Strucker (Earth-616)|Swordsman (Andreas Strucker)]], along with the [[Milos Masaryk (Earth-616)|Unicorn]] and the [[Enforcers (Earth-616)|Enforcer]] [[Ronald Bloch (Earth-616)|Ox]].{{r|Thunderbolts #104}} However they later rebelled and Cobra along with [[Brendon Doyle (Earth-616)|Mauler]], [[Russell Broxtel (Earth-616)|Firebrand]], and Mr. Hyde and attacked [[Criti Noll (Clone) (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]], [[Frank Payne (Earth-616)|Constrictor]], and other [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] staff and trainees at [[Camp Hammond]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #13}}

===X-Men===
Cobra and the Serpent Society were among the many villains the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] took down while protecting [[San Francisco]]. They were robbing a bank until they were defeated by [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]].{{r|X-Men: To Serve and Protect #2|4}} 

===Transforming his Nephew===
Upon becoming King Cobra, Klaus passed the Cobra identity on to his nephew [[Piet Voorhees (Earth-616)|Piet Voorhees]], administering the same mutagenic compound that gave him his powers.{{r|White Tiger #1}}

| Powers                  =
* '''Elasticity:''' King Cobra possesses certain unusual physical powers derived from his mutagenically altered physiology which among other things help him simulate the movement of a snake. All of the bones in his body, including his skull, are malleable and his muscle tissue is exceedingly resilient, making his body very flexible and pliant. It is nearly impossible for him to break a bone or tear a muscle. Hence, the Cobra can survive impacts that would kill or inflict major injury upon a normal human being with little or no injury to himself.
** The Cobra's flexibility enables him to slither into and out of very tight and small places. Through compressing his body, the Cobra can fit into any hole or slot down to four inches in diameter.
** By using his flexibility to wrap himself about a victim's body and then exerting his full strength, the Cobra traps that victim within his "Cobra Grip." No normal human being can break free of his grip unless he or she is extraordinarily well trained in fighting, and even many superhumanly strong beings would have difficulty freeing themselves.
** The Cobra has a great degree of independent control over every muscle in his body, enabling him to slither across the ground, without using his arms and legs, simply by muscle contraction. He is extremely quick, capable of moving up to 50 miles per hour for several seconds by this method. His agility and speed make him very difficult to catch and hold onto.

| Transportation          = [[Serpent Saucer]].
| Weapons                 = King Cobra has developed a number of special weapons to enhance his cobra-like powers. His costume is specially treated with a silicon and graphite-dust compound, making it extremely slippery. He has also designed special chemical suction devices for his fingers and feel, enabling him to stick to walls and ceilings. In the compartment behind his articulated chest armor is a fifty-foot long coil of steel cable that can be shot by means of a powerful spring.

From his spring-loaded device the Cobra can shoot a number of deadly projectiles. His "cobra-bite" missiles contain cobra venom. The venom from a single such missile can kill average-size, normal human being in six minutes. It takes more than one venom-filled missile to have the same effect on a superhumanly strong human being. The Cobra has also used projectiles carrying smoke, nerve gas, and a special substance that induces temporary blindness.

* [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] has stated he believes King Cobra could be a potential threat if he could 'pull himself together mentally'.{{r|New Avengers Most Wanted Files #1}}
