===Origin===
Utopia was the main headquarters of the majority of the [[Homo Superior|mutant]] population and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. Utopia first began as [[Asteroid M]], the orbital space station of [[Homo Superior|mutant]] terrorist [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]].  Asteroid M had several levels, including an observation deck, hangar bays, medical facilities, technology that kept it concealed from standard detection technology, and was positioned in stationary orbit, probably over [[Anya Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Anya Lehnsherr's]] (Magneto's eldest child) grave. Magneto completed construction on Asteroid M just before recruiting his original group of [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 -1}}  It was destroyed in a battle with the original X-Men, when someone was suspected of hitting the wrong buttons that would initiate the self-destruction of the base.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 5}}

===Creation===
Many years later, Utopia was brought back to the surface by the [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]], under the direction of [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]].  Seeing no other option, Cyclops decided to move the mutant population (then stationed in the Marin Headlands at [[Graymalkin Industries]]) to this island, and off [[United States|U.S.]] soil to avoid further persecution by the government, and [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] and his [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] in particular.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 8}}

===Obstacles===
Although the X-Men's island public (still unofficial) sovereignty protected them from Osborn, they still were not free from other issues and further besiegement. Almost immediately the X-Men had to worry about food and water supplies. [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] and [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] were able to use their mutant abilities to aid in supplementing the water supply. [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] and [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]] were tasked with cultivating a farm,{{r|Nation X Vol 1 3}} but in the meantime [[Sadie Sinclair (Earth-616)|Mayor Sinclair]] commissioned food supplies to be delivered to Utopia on a semi-regular basis.

After the death of [[Yuriko Takiguchi (Earth-616)|Dr. Takiguchi]], Utopia hosted it's first funeral service. Dr. Takiguchi's death left the X-Club one member short, but they were still tasked with the dire issue of preventing the sinking of Utopia. This issue was temporarily solved with the arrival of former villain now turned repentant [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]. Magneto was recruited by the X-Club to utilizes his electromagnetic powers to keep Utopia afloat. However, this meant long, daily sessions for Magneto. To find a more permanent solution and to win the trust of Cyclops, Magneto secretly approached [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] with a proposition. Magneto suggested that Namor build a large pillar structure underneath Utopia to prevent the island's sinking and to act as a new home for the scattered [[Atlanteans]]. Namor consented and [[New Atlantis (Atlantean Pillar)|New Atlantis]] was born.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 516|520}}

===Attacks===
Despite escaping the threat of Osborn, the X-Men's numerous other enemies wasted little time is attacking their new home. [[Lobe (Earth-616)|Lobe]] and his [[Lobe's Team (Earth-616)|U-Men]], forced [[John Greycrow (Earth-616)|Scalphunter]] to kamikaze several [[Predator X|Predator X's]] onto Utopia.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 516|520}}  Later Lobe's team was also responsible for the release of a virulent strain of [[HX-N1]] to infect the X-Men with power-sapping flu. Utopia was temporarily placed under quarantine as a result.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 530|534}}

[[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]] attacked to kidnap mutants to feed his hunger.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Annual Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 228|230}}

[[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]] sent an army of undead mutants along with her elite team of [[Inner Circle (Selene) (Earth-616)|Death Dealers]] to attack the island.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 23}}{{r|Necrosha}}

Not long afterward, with the [[Second Coming|return]] of [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] and [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], [[Bastion (Earth-616)|Bastion]] was able to launch his final plans for the destruction of mutantkind. Bastion was able to create an impenetrable dome over Utopia and the Bay Area to cut off the X-Men from any help. Inside the dome, Bastion opened a portal to allow several [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod Sentinels]] to enter and attack.{{r|Second Coming}}

After a brief break, the X-Men were next attacked by [[Xarus (Earth-616)|Xarus]] and his [[Vampires|vampire hordes]].{{r|X-Men Vol 3 1|7}}

After [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Kid Omega]]'s [[Telepathy|telepathic]] attack on the [[United Nations]], anti-mutant sentiment began to rise and world leaders began reactivating [[Sentinels]];{{r|X-Men: Schism Vol 1 1}} meanwhile, in [[San Francisco]], [[Sadie Sinclair (Earth-616)|Mayor Sinclair]] expedite the grand opening of the '''Mutant History Museum'''. Unfortunately, [[Kade Kilgore (Earth-616)|Kade Kilgore]] and his [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] used this opportunity to attack the X-Men. Despite Wolverine's objections, Cyclops ordered Idie to stop the Hellfire Club by killing them all. These event lead to a giant super-Sentinel nearly destroying Utopia, and Cyclops and Wolverine parting ways because of philosophical differences.{{r|X-Men: Schism Vol 1 2|5}}{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 10|11}}

===Phoenix Five and Downfall===
After [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] arrived on Utopia, demanding [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], a [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|war between the Avengers and the X-Men]] began. Due to the Avengers intervention, the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] was accidentally split, and merged with five X-Men. Using their new powers, [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]] recreated Utopia into a giant structure raised floating over the [[San Francisco Bay]]. After the Phoenix Force was excised from Cyclops, Utopia fell, ruined, back into the bay, sinking more and more everyday.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 12}}{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 18}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 19}}{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 2 7.1}}

===New Tian===
When [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] took over the United States and displaced mutantkind into the West Coast, turning most of [[California (State)|California]] into the sovereign nation of [[New Tian]], Utopia was restored and turned into the new nation's capital, and where [[Shen Xorn (Earth-616)|Shen Xorn]]'s throne room was located.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 7}} Following the collapse of the Hydra regime and New Tian's dissolution, Utopia was demolished.{{r|Secret Empire Omega Vol 1 1}}
