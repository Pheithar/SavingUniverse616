===Origin===
Shatterstar is the biological son of former [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] [[Longshot (Mojoverse)|Longshot]] and [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]]; however, due to a temporal paradox, he was also responsible for the creation of Longshot. It was revealed that because of [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]]'s manipulation of Shatterstar by sending him back in time to the [[Mojoverse]] along with [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]], Shatterstar was discovered and experimented on by [[Arize (Mojoverse)|Arize]] who created Longshot from his DNA. As Longshot was genetically extrapolated from Shatterstar's genes, Star was essentially Longshot's father. This created a paradox when Longshot years later impregnated Dazzler who then gave birth to Shatterstar. Longshot and Dazzler were mindwiped to forget the pregnancy and the Shatterstar infant was sent 100 years into the future by his own adult self in order to maintain the consistency of the time line.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 259}}

===Mojoworld===
Shatterstar learned the arts of battle as a warrior in arenas on Mojoworld, where he participated in combats staged for Mojo's television programs. It’s assumed it was here he developed his strong sense of honor and pride as a warrior, to combat the constant violence and death in his life. 

During his time in the arenas, Shatterstar formed a relationship with [[Gringrave (Mojoverse)|Gringrave]], a popular female gladiator commonly known as the Smiling Executioner. Gringrave manipulated Shatterstar for her own ends, teaching him not to love or get attached to others, and live only for the thrill of the kill.{{r|Shatterstar  Vol 1 2}}{{r|Shatterstar Vol 1 4}}

Eventually, Shatterstar grew disillusioned with the idea of killing for sport. He escaped and joined the Blood Cadre Alliance, the rebel group that sought to overthrow [[Mojo V (Mojoverse)|Mojo V]]'s dictatorship. From there, he learned the Cadre’s language and began taking part in missions, one of which sent him back in time to find the X-Men and get their assistance in defeating Mojo.{{r|New Mutants #99|100}}

===X-Force===
Instead of finding the X-Men, Shatterstar was transported back in time to Earth at the point just before Cable reorganized the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] into [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]]. With [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]]'s assurance that they would help him defeat Mojo, Shatterstar became a founding member of the new team.{{r|New Mutants #100}} X-Force was also where he first met [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]]. Shatterstar and Rictor formed a close friendship. Shatterstar learned Spanish specifically to communicate privately with Rictor.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 34}} After an awkward trip to a nightclub, Shatterstar also confessed to Ric that he wasn't emotionally prepared for physical interaction, due to his upbringing on Mojoworld. Rictor vowed to help Star with his development.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 43}}

Later Shatterstar discovered, to his bewilderment, that he also had the memories of an Earthling named [[Benjamin Russell (Earth-616)|Benjamin Russell]].{{r|X-Force Vol 1 56}} Soon afterwards, Mojo made Cable and Shatterstar his prisoners and transformed them into digital images for one of his television programs. In the course of the show, Shatterstar was mortally wounded in combat. Mojo's sometime ally [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]] teleported Cable and Shatterstar back into reality, where they regained their true forms. Spiral brought Cable, Shatterstar, Longshot, and the X-Force member [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] to the [[Weisman Institute for the Criminally Insane]] in [[Rutland]], [[Vermont (State)|Vermont]].{{Citation}}

There Spiral directed them to the bedside of one of its patients, a mutant named Benjamin Russell who had no living relatives, had been in a coma since his powers had emerged, and, curiously, looked identical to Shatterstar. Longshot transferred Shatterstar's "uemeur," or soul, into Benjamin Russell's body, and the two became one. Apparently Shatterstar's body merged with Russell's as well, for the resulting body bore the starburst pattern that Shatterstar had around his left eye and his hair lengthened greatly. Restored to full health and consciousness, and feeling "whole" for the first time in his life, Shatterstar resumed his work as a member of X-Force.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 59|61}}

[[File:X-Force Shatterstar Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|180px]]
Shatterstar accompanied Rictor to the Richter home in [[Mexico]] to try and end Rictor's family's arms-dealing business.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 70}}{{r|X-Force Annual #1999}} Presumably they succeeded, though it’s not known why they later parted.

Shatterstar was later in [[Madripoor]], earning his money by fighting in arenas. He was sought out by Spiral, who had one of her agents make Shatterstar believe she wanted to kill him. With a fake quest, Spiral lured Shatterstar to an alternate universe she had conquered and ruled. On that Earth, Spiral had also killed most of that worlds heroes and mutants. That Earth's Shatterstar had been killed as well. He was found by that Earth's rebel forces, including Cable and some others he knew from X-Force. Together, they eventually defeated Spiral.{{r|{{cl|X-Force: Shatterstar Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Force: Shatterstar Vol 1 4|4]]}} Upon returning to the mainstream Earth, Shatterstar was contacted by Cable, who requested that Shatterstar temporarily join him on a mission to defeat the [[Skornn (Earth-616)|Skornn]]. Shatterstar agreed, but first Cable wanted him to train with monks on Mount Xixabangma. After those monks were killed by Skornn's worshipers, Shatterstar was reunited with his old team and they eventually killed the Skornn.{{r|X-Force Vol 2 #1|6}}

===M-Day and Civil War===
Following [[Decimation|M-Day]] and the passing of the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], Shatterstar teamed up with former X-Force allies [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] and [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]] to break [[198 (Earth-616)|The 198]] out of the encampment set up for mutants on the grounds of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]]. They took the escapees to a secret base provided to them by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] via [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]. While fighting [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E (Earth-616)|O*N*E]] he nearly killed [[Scott Wright (Earth-616)|Micromax]], claiming that while there is no such thing as murder during war, he had only meant to disable him.{{r|Civil War: X-Men #1|4}}

===X-Factor Investigations===
At some unknown point, [[James Madrox (Cortex) (Earth-616)|Cortex]] gained control over Shatterstar and sent him to attack his friends. While searching for Madrox, Rictor and [[Guido Carosella (Earth-616)|Strong Guy]] discovered [[John Maddox (Earth-616)|Father Maddox]], a dupe of Madrox's, that had been living in New England as a priest. They decided to investigate further, hoping to find the whereabouts of Madrox Prime. Upon meeting Father Maddox, a masked man crashed through the window with swords ablaze. After a brief battle, the attacker was revealed to be Shatterstar, possessed by Cortex.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 43}}

[[File:Julio Richter (Earth-616) and Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse) from X-Factor Vol 3 45 001.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Rictor and Shatterstar kissing]]
Once Shatterstar was broken out of his trance-like state, and recognized Rictor, the two embraced one another and finally shared a kiss.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 45}} 

Shortly afterwards Shatterstar transported X-Factor to [[Latveria]], where he remained with [[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|Layla Miller]] and [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Dr. Doom]] for a while.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 202}} Layla and Shatterstar next appeared at [[Dublin Airport]] to save [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Theresa Cassidy]] from [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Dr. Bolivar Trask]]'s [[Mutant Response Division (Earth-616)|Mutant Response Division]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 205}} After they escaped, the trio rejoined the rest of X-Factor back in New York City.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 206}}

Rictor and Shatterstar began a steady romantic relationship after Shatterstar's return though not without its difficulties. Rictor, having finally come to terms with his sexual identity, wanted a stable monogamous relationship with Shatterstar. Shatterstar, on the other hand, found himself interested in a more open relationship that would allow him to explore other sexual possibilities. The two resolved that they would work things out, and proceeded to make up both emotionally and physically. However, before they could get very far, the two were interrupted when a pregnant [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]] barged in.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 207}}

Wolfsbane was pregnant with [[Hrimhari (Earth-616)|Hrimhari]]'s child, although she led Rictor and the others to believe he was the father.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 210}} This lie did not last long as a brief encounter between Hrimhari and Shatterstar in [[Niffleheim]] cleared up the question of paternity.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 212}}

After the birth and abandonment of Wolfsbane's son, Shatterstar and Rictor volunteered (unsolicited) to accompany Wolfsbane in searching for her child.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 238}} The trio first traveled to [[Hel]] and receive a mystic amulet to locate the child, and finally found him in [[Sproul State Forest]] in [[Pennsylvania (State)|Pennsylvania]]. Wolfsbane's son, [[Tier Sinclair (Earth-616)|Tier]], was being tracked independently by both [[Armando Muñoz (Earth-616)|Darwin]] and [[Vanora (Earth-7153)|Vanora]] but Shatterstar and Rictor were able to fight off attacks from both, and Tier escaped unharmed with his mother. Wolfsbane then chose to leave X-Factor and raise Tier with the aid and protection of [[Jack Russell (Earth-616)|Jack Russell, the Werewolf By Night]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 242}} Shatterstar and Rictor, however, returned to X-Factor Investigations in New York City.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 245}} 

After Rahne and her son, Tier, returned to X-Factor to seek sanctuary from Darwin and other would-be assassins, all of X-Factor were transported to [[Mephisto's Realm|Hell]]. The [[Hell Lords]] vied to gain overall control by killing Tier, and X-Factor fought their demon armies to protect him. When Shatterstar attacked [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] to free Tier from a magical prison, Mephisto seemingly vaporised him, before doing the same to Rictor.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 256}}

===After X-Factor===
In fact, Rictor and Shatterstar both ended up going back in time and being transported to the [[Mojoverse]]. Shatterstar was again brainwashed into attacking Rictor - this time in a televised gladiatorial battle. Rictor managed to incapacitate Shatterstar, before escaping the arena with help from Mojoverse rebels, including the Longshot of this era. Whilst he was unconscious, Shatterstar was brought to [[Arize (Mojoverse)|Arize]], who cloned him (and used some of his DNA to create Longshot). Shatterstar awoke in time to use his powers to escape an attack by [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]] and [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]], and Shatterstar transported them forward in time. In this new time period, Rictor came across [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]] giving birth to Shatterstar as a baby. Rictor and Shatterstar helped to deliver the baby, before Shatterstar erased Dazzler's memory. To maintain the timeline as it was meant to take place, Shatterstar then transported himself, Rictor, and his infant self forward in time again - by 100 years - to the period he grew up in.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 259}}

Shatterstar and Rictor somehow made it back to Earth and their own time, and joined their fellow mutants - including former teammates Strong Guy and Wolfsbane - in [[New Tian]].{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 3}} After New Tian was dismantled, Rictor told Iceman that he and Shatterstar were now on a break.{{r|Iceman Vol 3 9}}

Shatterstar rejoined the X-Men in New York to investigate signs that the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] might have returned to Earth, checking the Manhattan sewers in a team with Dazzler and Strong Guy.{{r|Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 2}}

===Landlord of Manor Crossing===
[[File:Julio Richter (Earth-616) and Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse) from Shatterstar Vol 1 2 001.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Rictor and Shatterstar try to navigate their newly separated status]]
Feeling unsure about himself and his relationship with Rictor, Shatterstar ended things between them.{{r|Shatterstar Vol 1 2}} Newly single, Shatterstar bought a property using the earnings he’d made and named it Manor Crossing. He offered the rooms to multi-dimensional refugees like himself and served as both landlord and protector to his tenants. When Shatterstar’s tenants were kidnapped by the Mojoworld mercenary group the [[Death Sponsors (Mojoverse)|Death Sponsors]] and their leader, former ally [[Gringrave (Mojoverse)|Gringrave]], Shatterstar vowed to bring them home.{{r|Shatterstar Vol 1 1}}

With help from Rictor, Shatterstar followed the group to the world of Horus IV, which was ruled by the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]]. Grandmaster tasked Gringrave with the kidnapping, hoping to use a gladiatorial battle between the enemies to satisfy the Horuvians lust for bloody conflict.{{r|Shatterstar Vol 1 2}}

After Shatterstar killed Gringrave in revenge for her actions,{{r|Shatterstar Vol 1 4}} Grandmaster himself entered the arena, seeking to gain control of Shatterstar for all eternity. But Shatterstar refused to concede and defeated Grandmaster by teleporting them to [[Earth-1218]], a world where super-powered beings do not exist and Grandmaster’s god powers could not work. Shatterstar was then rescued by Rictor, who reached out across the universe to find him and bring him home.{{r|Shatterstar Vol 1 5}}

===The Hunt for Kid Cable===
Shatterstar was shocked when his former mentor Cable was slain while attempting to protect the time-displaced Iceman.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 2}} When it was revealed that a younger version of Cable was responsible, Shatterstar partnered with his former X-Force teammates to hunt down [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Kid Cable]] and have him answer for his crime. During the search, Shatterstar was turned into one of [[Roderick Campbell (Earth-811)|Ahab’s]] mutant-hunting hounds and attempted to kill the time-displaced Jean Grey.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 3}} Shatterstar was subdued by Cannonball and freed of Ahab's influence.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 4}}

After Kid Cable returned the time-displaced X-Men to their timeline and disappeared, Shatterstar joined a newly reformed X-Force to resume their search for him. They found Kid Cable in the small nation of [[Transia]], working with [[Deathlok Prime (Earth-10511)|Deathlok]] to uncover how the country’s military had gotten ahold of weapons from Kid Cable’s future. Shatterstar and his team were forced to team up with Kid Cable when they were framed for the murder of the Transian president.{{r|X-Force Vol 5 1}}

Shatterstar struggled to trust Kid Cable and accept him as the real Nathaniel Summers,{{r|X-Force Vol 5 2}} but the pair worked together with the rest of X-Force to defeat the Transian military. They learned the military’s futuristic weapons were being supplied by [[Nathaniel Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]] through a time portal.{{r|X-Force Vol 5 4}} Strye took Kid Cable into the future through the portal and X-Force resolved to rescue both him and the kidnapped [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]]. Shatterstar was prepared to give his life for the potentially one-way mission, feeling like there was little left for him since Rictor’s presumed death.{{r|X-Force Vol 5 7}}

X-Force defeated Stryfe, rescued both Kid Cable and Rachel Summers, and found a way to return to their timeline. Shatterstar finally declared his trust in Kid Cable and forgave him for murdering the older Cable. Shatterstar also resolved to return to the present, stop seeking distractions, and instead focus on grieving Rictor properly.{{r|X-Force Vol 5 10}}

===Krakoa===
Shatterstar was of the many mutants that joined the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] upon its creation. He was seen alongside many other Krakoans grieving Charles Xavier death at the hands of anti-mutant super-human criminals that had infiltrated Krakoa and killed many of its residents, including Xavier.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 2}}

[[File:Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse) from X-Factor Vol 4 3 002.jpg|250px|left|Shatterstar as Mojoverse's top live-streamer]]
At some point, Shatterstar returned to Mojoworld, becoming the dimension’s most subscribed and top-ranked live-streamer. However, Shatterstar began to feel trapped by the celebrity status he had created for himself. When fellow live-streamer [[Sofia Mantega (Earth-616)|Wind Dancer]] arranged for her own death to satisfy her fans, Shatterstar secretly informed the Krakoan [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] team so they could claim her body before [[Arize (Mojoverse)|Arize]] could produce a clone and force Wind Dancer to resume her stream. X-Factor were successful in their mission, but had to leave Shatterstar behind in Mojoworld. They promised to one day return and rescue him.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 3}} The team eventually made good on this promise coming back alongside the New Mutants and arranging the freedom of all mutants there. After this they recruited Shatterstar to defeat [[Morrigan (Earth-616)|The Morrigan]], freeing [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] from her control.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 9}}

| Powers                  = 
Shatterstar is a mutant,{{r|X-Force Vol 1 4}} the naturally born son of the mutant Dazzler and the artificially-engineered Biped Longshot.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 259}} As a result, he was born with many of the superhuman traits Longshot was engineered to possess, in addition to his own unique mutant abilities. Shatterstar also merged with the individual named Benjamin Russell, with whom he shares an unexplained connection. Russell was also reportedly a mutant.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 61}} Russell's mutant powers are unknown, but Shatterstar did not appear to gain or lose any abilities when the two merged. (Although his teleporting ability surfaced after he bonded with Russell, the two events happened 13 years apart and were not noticeably connected.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 49}})

* '''Empathically-Driven Teleportation:''' After Shatterstar returned from the [[Mojoverse]], he demonstrated the ability to open an "X" shaped portal allowing him to instantly transport himself.

Known anchors include Rictor, Longshot, and Layla Miller.
