| History                 = When Tommy was five years old, his parents were arrested by the L.A.P.D. for operating a distillery during the Prohibition period on the location where his theater was located. Tommy was raised by a man named Hodges and scraped out a living as an extra in stage performances. Later he got a job in musicals but they soon went broke as well.

Finally, when his film studio was bought out and shut down by Richmond Industries and was slated to become a housing project, Tommy swore revenge on [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Kyle Richmond]]. He and Hodges contacted the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]], built or acquired a large number of humanoid robots, and used gas grenades to capture the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]]. Binding them to a large set piece from one of his studio's failed musicals, he had the robots surround them and begin dancing while beating the Defenders with steel cane-bludgeons. The Defenders escaped, and fought the robots until [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] knocked the robots' control device from Hodges' hands. [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] and the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] then defeated Tommy.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 #30}}
