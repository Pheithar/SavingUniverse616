| History                 = Very little is known about Assault and Battery, save that they seem to be twin brothers. They were part of a group of Roxxon-employed terrorists and mercenaries, led by [[David Angar (Earth-616)|Angar the Screamer]], who briefly managed to take over the S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Helicarrier in a daring commando strike. However, they soon were defeated. One of the Super-Agents, Knockout, managed to throw one of them over a ledge and into a deep pit, causing the other one to be pulled after him.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 33|35}}
