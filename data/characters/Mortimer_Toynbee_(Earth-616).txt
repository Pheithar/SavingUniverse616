===Origin===
Mortimer Toynbee was abandoned by his parents so early in his childhood that he couldn't remember them. He was placed in an orphanage where the other children continually tormented him, who regarded him as a freak due to his ugliness, his unusual physique, and his leaping ability. Toynbee was so traumatized by his loneliness and the continual abuse he received that it affected his learning abilities. The teachers and administrators in the orphanage therefore regarded Toynbee as mentally challenged, even though, in actuality, he had a rather gifted intelligence. So desperate did Toynbee become for affection that he developed a pathetically subservient personality, and would unquestioningly obey anyone he thought sincerely cared about him.{{Citation}}

===Brotherhood of Evil Mutants===
At some point after reaching adulthood, Toynbee was discovered by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and recruited for his [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. Magneto gave Toynbee the alias of the Toad because of Toynbee's powers, appearance, and personality. Magneto did not believe that the Toad's powers would be of any great service to him, but he thought it useful to have an expendable pawn who would follow his orders unquestioningly. The Toad was indeed pathetically devoted to Magneto; he subconsciously referred to him as a surrogate father. He blinded himself to Magneto's continual verbal and physical abuse because Magneto was out to conquer the human race that had rejected the Toad. The Toad believed that he would be given a place of honor in the new society that Magneto would create.{{Citation}}

As a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, the Toad met the mutant [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], and became infatuated with her, though she did not reciprocate the feeling. Also on the team were the Scarlet Witch's brother [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] and the illusionist [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Mastermind]]. The Brotherhood battled the original [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] repeatedly, but the X-Men continually thwarted them.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 4|7}}

Magneto and the Toad were captured by the alien called the [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]] and imprisoned on a distant world.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 11}} When Magneto first escaped, he callously left the Toad behind,{{r|X-Men Vol 1 17}} and the Toad's attitude towards his master began to change. After being recaptured, Magneto escaped a second time and took the Toad with him, but his continued abuse caused the Toad's resentment to increase until it flared into murderous hatred. The Toad deliberately abandoned Magneto to die in an explosion that followed an encounter with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and the X-Men. When Magneto tried to escape, the Toad blocked his way out, causing Magneto to fall to his apparent death.{{r|Avengers #53}} It was later discovered that Magneto survived.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 63}}

===Recluse===
[[File:X-Men Vol 1 4.jpg|left|thumb|First appearance]]
The Toad became a recluse, but was soon captured along with the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, first by the mutant-hunting robots called the [[Sentinels]] and later, while he was supporting the Scarlet Witch in her quest to recover her powers, by the extra-dimensional warrior [[Arkon (Earth-616)|Arkon]].{{r|Avengers #75}} When the Avengers rescued Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch,{{r|Avengers #76}} the Toad asked to remain on Arkon's world, where he employed its technological resources to build a ship that would carry him across space and the dimensional barrier. He returned to the Stranger's planet.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 138}}

There he studied and stole the Stranger's technology and equipment in an effort to become more powerful and thus more appealing to the Scarlet Witch. However, just as he prepared to return to Earth, he learned that the Scarlet Witch had married the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]]. Enraged, he planned to strike out at her, attacking the Avengers to learn her whereabouts, but was defeated.{{r|Avengers #138}}

===Terrible Toad-King===
He served a short prison term and was released, at which time he commissioned the criminal [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] to construct a series of deadly traps in a seemingly deserted castle in upstate New York. Renaming himself the Terrible Toad-King, he planned to entrap everyone who he felt had abused him, placing them in the castle where they would be killed in the attempt to escape. His first victim was the X-Man [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]]. In capturing the Angel, the Toad accidentally kidnapped the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] too. Just as the two were about to escape, Arcade stepped in and demanded immediate payment for his services. Unable to pay and fearful for his own life, the Toad fell into a panic.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One Vol 1 68}}

The Angel took pity on Toynbee and formulated an agreement with him to convert the castle into an amusement park, paying the debt in the process.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One Vol 1 68}} The endeavor was a success until it was discovered that the castle's original owner was [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Victor von Doom]]. Doom sent a robot of himself and a security force to remove the Toad and restore the structure to its original state.{{Citation}}

===Spider-Man and the Misfits===
Toynbee again fell into despondency and decided to commit suicide, an attempt that was interrupted by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]. In an effort to buoy Toynbee's spirits, Spider-Man offered his friendship. As eager for this acceptance as he had been for Magneto's, the Toad became determined to be Spider-Man's partner, despite Spider-Man's gentle protests. The Toad resorted to a ruse in an effort to change his mind, and hired a group of criminals to attack Spider-Man, an assault the Toad would then help foil. In the process he attracted the attention of [[Eugene Patilio (Earth-616)|Frog Man]] and [[Oliver Osnick (Earth-616)|Spider-Kid]], two young men who also wished to team-up with Spider-Man. During the fight, the three found themselves interested in a partnership of their own and formed a trio they called the Misfits.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 #266}}

===Obsession===
Though seeking the help of a psychiatrist during this period, Toynbee was still obsessed with the Scarlet Witch. In direct contradiction to his law-enforcing partnership with Frog Man and Spider-Kid, the Toad used the technology stolen from the Stranger to attempt to kidnap her. His first such try, during a Thanksgiving celebration, involved robot doppelgangers of the original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Stopped by the Vision, Quicksilver, and the recently-reformed Magneto, it was Quicksilver who actually subdued the Toad, who was again calling himself the Terrible Toad-King.{{r|Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol 2 6}}

Toynbee and his automatons were removed to [[Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. (Earth-616)|Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.]] for study, but one of the robots reactivated on a timed program and freed its builder. The Vision pursued the Toad to his ship and narrowly defeated him, sending the ship into space, out of control.{{r|Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol 2 7}} Toad regained control in time to successfully return to Earth, where he attacked once again. He became violently agitated when this attempt brought him into conflict with Spider-Man, whose approval he still valued. The Toad defeated Spider-Man and the Vision using a powerful exoskeleton and forced his way into the New Jersey home owned by the Scarlet Witch and the Vision. The Scarlet Witch was eight months pregnant, and when the Toad confronted her, he found her condition repulsive. She defeated him, but he escaped.{{r|Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol 2 11}}

===Toad's Brotherhood===
Eventually the Toad sought to form a new Brotherhood, recruiting [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]], [[St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616)|Pyro]], [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]], and [[Eileen Harsaw (Earth-616)|Phantazia]]. Allied with the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]], the team attempted to take down the mutant strike team [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] in a violent battle.{{r|X-Force #5|10}} They would later clash with [[Chris Powell (Earth-616)|Darkhawk]] and [[Sleepwalker (Earth-616)|Sleepwalker]] over the interdimensional mutant [[Charles Little Sky (Earth-616)|Portal]].{{r|Darkhawk #19|20}} Toad's Brotherhood later disbanded.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 Annual #2}}

For a time, Toad stayed at the Canadian estate of [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], after the former White Queen had taken pity on him. This led to a minor skirmish with Emma's students, [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]], who were not expecting to find him there.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 18|19}}

===Metamorphosis===
Toad, [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]], [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], and [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] were later summoned by [[Prosh (Earth-616)|Prosh]] to stop the Stranger's attempt to accelerate the evolution of humans and mutants. During their time jumps an embryo thought to be an unborn Toad was examined by the Black Womb Project and deemed unfit. His flawed genetic structure was corrected, resulting in an almost complete metamorphosis: Toad had a taller, slimmer physique and had his powers augmented. Among the most notable changes was a prehensile tongue. He participated in the final battle with the Stranger, along with Prosh and Mystique and the rest of the team. After their success, Toad left.{{r|X-Men Forever Vol 1 1|6}}

===Magneto's "Death"===
Toad eventually resurfaced in [[Genosha]] after Sentinels killed nearly all 16 million of the country's mutant citizens. Toad, along with [[Toad-In-Waiting (Earth-616)|Toad-In-Waiting]], were paying respects to his former master Magneto, who was believed to have been among the casualties.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 132}}

===[[M-Day]] and [[Utopia (Event)|Utopia]]===
After [[M-Day]] over ninety percent of the world's mutant population lost their powers as a result. Toad was among the relative handful to retain his powers. Toad took refuge at the Xavier Institute where the X-Men had set up a camp for the remaining mutants, helping his fellow mutant [[Lorelei Travis (Earth-616)|Lorelei]] after she was beaten up by [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purity]]. During the Dark Reign, Toad was fighting in the riot against the Human Front and the X-Man Cyclops, and later, helped by [[Hope Abbott (Earth-616)|Trance]] and [[Tamara Kurtz (Earth-616)|Dragoness]] escape to H.A.M.M.E.R soldiers. Later, with Dragoness, [[Litterbug (Earth-616)|Litterbug]], and [[Bliss (Morlock) (Earth-616)|Bliss]], Toad tried to take control of the Utopian Water but was stopped by [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]]. During the Second Coming of the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|mutant messiah]], Mortimer lost a finger fighting a Nimrod.{{Citation}}

===Jean Grey School===
[[File:Mortmier Toynbee (Earth-616) from Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 33 001.jpg|thumb|right|180px|As janitor]]
Feeling a second-class citizen in Utopia, Toad followed [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] in his efforts to rebuild the Westchester school for mutants.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis Vol 1 1 }} Mortimer became the janitor at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]]. He often sought to keep the school clean and stop the students from misbehaving, but he was usually completely ignored for his efforts.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 1|3}} When the Phoenix Force approached Earth, Quentin Quire was incapacitated after touching its essence, and fell from the sky during flight class. Toad rushed to save him, springing across several buildings and catching Quire with his tongue before he struck the ground. When the other adults at the school reached the scene, Toad was embarrassed and tried to avoid attention, thinking they'd reprimand him for his actions. [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]], however, was incredibly impressed with his bravery and abilities, and told him so.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 9}}

===Hellfire Academy===
Toad eventually left the Jean Grey School to join the newly established [[Hellfire Academy (Earth-616)|Hellfire Academy]], after being urged by his girlfriend, Husk.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 30}} He believed he would finally become a teacher and use his knowledge for good, but he was delegated to cleaning duties there too.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 31}} Unhappy with the way he was treated at the Hellfire Academy, Toad helped [[Quentin Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]] try to escape. During their breakout, they ran into Husk and the other students and got into a fight with them to regain their freedom. Husk charged against Toad and hit him with everything she had, but Toad refused to fight back against her. After seeing she couldn't be reasoned with, however, he apologized and began ripping layer after layer of her skin, until she finally regained her senses. Unfortunately, she also lost the memories of her relationship with him.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 32|35}}

After the battle, he returned to the Jean Grey School, but the rest of the staff didn't trust him anymore. Toad accepted this but was visibly depressed about the situation. Paige asked him out so she could get to know him again, but he was afraid she'd realize she was too good for him and instead left for parts unknown with [[Maximilian Frankenstein (Earth-616)|Doctor Frankenstein]], after the teenager escaped from the school.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 41}}

===All-New X-Men===
Toad eventually rejoined the X-Men {{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men Vol 1 1}} and found himself being happy for once about his life. His happiness, however, was cut short due to the [[Terrigen Mist]] crisis and [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] war against the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]]. The Jean Grey School publicly closed its doors and moved to a refuge called [[X-Haven]] in [[Limbo (Otherplace)|Limbo]], prompting Toad to leave the facilities.{{Citation}}

From there onwards, Mortimer's life spiraled into misery. He became an alcoholic and lived in a precarious hotel. When he discovered the whereabouts of Cyclops' [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|time-displaced younger self]], Toad started to believe that if he killed the young Cyclops, he would produce a change in the timeline, erasing the actions the present-day Cyclops caused. Mortimer knew it was an atrocity to murder the young Cyclops for crimes he hadn't yet committed, but he believed it to be a necessary evil.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 7}}

[[File:Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616) from All-New X-Men Vol 2 7 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
When the X-Men traveled to Paris, Toad followed them and abducted Scott to the Parisian catacombs.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 6}} In order to prevent Toad from killing him, Scott used his optic blasts and caused a cave-in that separated them, but heavily injured him. Scott ended up without his visor and a broken leg. Toad followed the trail of blood left by Scott and used kerosene to ignite it. As a last resort, Scott released an optic blast once more, producing a second and bigger cave-in. Toad escaped in time, and believed Scott to have died due to the destruction caused (he would later be found comatose by his teammates). Devastated by the lack of any change in the timeline, Toad  panicked and ran away.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 7}}

===New Tian===
When [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] took over the United States and displaced mutant kind to the newly created [[New Tian]], Toad became a member of a strike team assembled by New Tian's government. He also underwent a [[Secondary Mutation|secondary mutation]] which granted him the ability to engulf his tongue in fire.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 7}}

===House of X===
Alongside Sabretooth and Mystique, Toad was sent by Xavier on a mission to steal information about [[Nimrod]] and Mother Mold from [[Damage Control (Earth-616)|Damage Control]]. They were successful and escaped, only leaving Sabretooth behind due to the intervention of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = Toad is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] who has displayed the following abilities:
* '''Superhuman Leaping:''' Toad's primary power is the ability to leap to heights and distances far greater than that of an ordinary human. He possesses a degree of superhuman strength, particularly in his back and legs, which grants him his superior leaping abilities (able to reach 25 feet in a vertical leap and 37 feet in a broad jump), as well as deliver kicks with superhuman force.{{Citation}}
* '''Flexible Bone Structure:''' The Toad's bone structure enables him great flexibility. He can remain in a crouching position for long periods of time and perform contortionist type feats without causing any damage to his spine.{{Citation}}
* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' The Toad's muscles produce a significantly lower amount of fatigue toxins during physical activity than the muscles of an ordinary human. He can exert himself at peak capacity for several hours before fatigue begins to impair him.{{Citation}}
* '''Superhuman Agility:''' The Toad's overall equilibrium application is enhanced to some degree and his bodily coordination and balance are enhanced to levels that are beyond the human body's natural limits.{{Citation}}
* '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' The Toad's reflexes are enhanced to levels that are beyond the human body's natural limits.{{Citation}}
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' The Toad's body is tougher and more resistant to physical injury than an ordinary human's. He can withstand major impacts and physical trauma that would severely injure or kill an ordinary human with moderate discomfort.{{Citation}}
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' The Toad has a limited healing factor that allows him to recover from injuries and ailments at an accelerated rate. He can recover from minor ailments, such as a cold, within a few hours. Larger, more damaging injuries, such as broken bones, heal within a matter of days. He has also been shown as being able to regenerate severed body parts, such as when he regenerated his tongue, which had been completely cut off by Wolverine.{{Citation}}
* '''UV/Infrared Vision:''' The Toad's enhanced vision allows him to see into the ultraviolet and infrared spectrum, granting him a degree of heightened night vision. However, his eyes are also sensitive to certain types of lighting, forcing him to wear light-filtering goggles that allow him to operate in strong daylight that would otherwise blind him.{{Citation}}
* '''Prehensile Tongue:''' The Toad has the ability to extend his tongue up to 30 feet in length and use it as a whip to ensnare objects and people. His tongue is superhumanly strong, capable of lifting and crushing a magistrate of [[Genosha]] to death.{{Citation}}
* '''Pheromone Secretion:''' The Toad can secrete an odorless pheromone venom from glands in his tongue and fingertips that seeps through the skin directly into the bloodstream. This venom allows him to control the minds of anyone exposed to it to a limited extent. It is presumed that the victim's skin must be porous in order for this power to take effect.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #106}}
* '''Acidic Saliva:''' The Toad's saliva is highly acidic, adheres to most surfaces, and quickly dissolve most materials with ease.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 41}}
* '''Paralytic Resin:''' The Toad's pores secrete an adhesive resin that allows him to stick to any surface and paralyzes the nervous systems of any living organism that comes into contact with it.{{r|X-Force #7|8}}
* '''Superhuman Respiratory System:''' The Toad's lungs can expand and compress large quantities of air that can be expelled with enough force to knock a fully grown human off their feet.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #168}}
* '''Amphibian Control:''' The Toad has the ability to psionically communicate with and control amphibian life, such as frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders, who he often uses as spies.{{r|Generation X #18}}

===[[Secondary Mutation]]===
'''Flaming Tongue:''' At some point after becoming an inhabitant of [[New Tian]], Toad underwent a [[Secondary Mutation|secondary mutation]] that granted him the ability to release fire from his tongue.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 7}} It is currently unknown how hot the flames are or if they have any unique properties.

He was stated to be a '''Significant Threat''' by the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]].{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}} According to [[Prosh (Earth-616)|Prosh]], his Comparative Mutagenic Power Register was of 4.2.{{r|X-Men Forever #1}}. Interestingly, [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman's]] Comparative Mutagenic Power Register was 3.2.
| Abilities               = '''Experienced Combatant:''' The Toad has no formal knowledge of hand-to-hand combat. However, his powers enable him to execute a leaping kick with superhuman force at an opponent and his career as a servant of Magneto and foe of the X-Men has given him plenty of combat experience. The Toad's superhuman agility combined with his powerful legs (and, less so, his arms) makes him a highly formidable opponent in kick-boxing, despite a lack of any formal training.{{Citation}}

'''Expert Machinist:''' The Toad has a great knowledge of most forms of conventional and advanced technology, thanks to his studies of machinery in the possession of Arcade, Arkon, Magneto, and the Stranger. He once developed a robotic battle suit containing an exoskeleton that amplifies his strength and emits a pulse ball of lightning when it hits a target. It was also equipped with turbo blasters, poison gas projectors, and a self-teleportation device. The Toad has also used a strength amplifying exoskeleton composed of pure energy.{{Citation}}
| Strength                = '''Superhuman Strength:''' The Toad is superhumanly strong, primarily in his lower body, and is capable of leg pressing 3 tons. He possesses superhuman strength in his upper body as well, although to a much lower degree, and can lift about 1 ton. Toad's elongated tongue is also able to lift heavy weights, though the exact limit is unknown.{{Citation}}
| Weaknesses              = 
As a result of not bathing and the fact that his skin secretes unusual chemicals, the Toad usually has an offensive odor. The Toad also has a neurological chemical imbalance, which explains his drastic changes in personality.{{Citation}}

Toad has always had an unstable mutation, thanks to his infancy in the Black Womb Project. When he was injured in a battle with the Stranger, the Toad was healed by Prosh, which, in turn, corrected his flawed genetic structure, resulting in a slimmer physique and a prehensile tongue that secretes odorless, pheromone venom.{{r|X-Men Forever #4|6}}

| Equipment               = 
*He used the drug Ritalin to control the chemical imbalances in his mutant physiology.{{r|X-Men Forever #1}}
*A communication device in his ankle, which allowed him to communicate with [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]  from a distance. {{r|X-Men Vol 1 5}}
| Transportation          = 
| Weapons                 = 

| Notes                   = 

| Trivia                  = 
* In possession of [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]]' powers, [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] read in Toad's mind that he hates the name "Mortimer" and suspects that his own parents hate him.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #234}}
* As a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], the Toad annoyed most of his teammates due to his poor table manners. According to [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Mastermind]], Toad had the manners of a pig. {{r|X-Men Vol 1 4}}
* During a fight between Mastermind (on one side), and Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, the Toad expressed his hope that they would end up destroying each other. He had the ambition that he could rule the world alongside Magneto, with no other partner sharing in their power. {{r|X-Men Vol 1 4}}
*When meeting [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]], the Toad took particular note of how small Namor's wings were. He questioned whether they were of any use. {{r|X-Men Vol 1 4}} He was apparently comparing Namor's wings to the much larger wings of the [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]].
