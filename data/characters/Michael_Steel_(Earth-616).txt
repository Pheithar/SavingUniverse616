| History                 = Mike Steel was an engineer, scientist, and pilot before gaining his superhuman powers. With his teammates, he attempted to duplicate the original rocket flight of the Fantastic Four through a cosmic ray belt, and gained superhuman powers just as the Fantastic Four did. His team then first battled the [[Hulk]], although during the battle Ironclad lost control of his powers and sank into the ground.{{r|Incredible Hulk #254}}  His teammate [[James Darnell (Earth-616)|X-Ray]] bombarded the spot where he had sank with cosmic rays, boosting Steel's power until he could control it and dig his way back out to be reunited with the [[U-Foes]]. They again battled the Hulk and this time defeated him.  In triumph, they exhibited the captive Bruce Banner on national television.  However, Banner was freed by [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]], [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Betty Ross]], and the alien [[Bereet (Earth-616)|Bereet]], and Banner transformed into the Hulk and defeated the U-Foes.{{r|Incredible Hulk #275|277}}  With the U-Foes, Ironclad later escaped a special government prison, but was accidentally "deflected" by team leader [[Simon Utrecht (Earth-616)|Vector]] into the [[Crossroads (Dimension)|Crossroads]] dimension. There, he battled the Hulk and defeated him with the help of the alien [[Puffball Collective (Earth-616)|Puffball Collective]], though he became trapped in a dimension of quicksand.{{r|Incredible Hulk #304|305}}  Ironclad eventually escaped back to the "Crossroads" dimension, and with the U-Foes he made it back to Earth through a dimensional warp unintentionally opened by the [[Homo Superior|mutant]] [[Charles Little Sky (Earth-616)|Portal]]. The U-Foes battled the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[Thomas Fireheart (Earth-616)|Puma]], and Ironclad was defeated by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Forgotten One|Gilgamesh]].{{r|Avengers #304}}

Some time later, alongside other superhuman criminals, Ironclad attempted to escape from the [[Vault]], and battled the Avengers and [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]]. Alongside [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]], Ironclad sided with [[Thunderball]] against [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]] for leadership of the convicts.<ref>''The Vault Graphic Novel''</ref> Ironclad was later freed from the Vault, and with teammates [[Ann Darnell (Earth-616)|Vapor]] and X-Ray, Ironclad attacked the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|Avengers West Coast]], mistakenly believing they had killed Vector. Vector then reappeared alive and well, and led his teammates in a strategic retreat.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #53}}{{r|Avengers Spotlight #27}}  With the U-Foes, Ironclad later attacked a New York hospital in search of Charles Little Sky (who was now known as Portal), where they battled [[Chris Powell (Earth-616)|Darkhawk]], [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], and Captain America.{{r|Darkhawk #6}}

Mike was one of the 142 superhumans who registered as part of the Super-Human Registration Act.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #1}}<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map]</ref>

===The Hood===
Though a registered hero, Ironclad joined the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]]'s criminal organization who planned to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #28}}

| Powers                  = Ironclad's body has been bombarded with cosmic rays far greater then that of [[The Thing]], since then his teammate [[X-Ray]] has once more bathed him in cosmic rays so as to achieve better control over his powers.

'''Metallic-Armored-like Skin:''' Ironclad's body is covered in a metallic-like and remarkably tough armored skin.

*'''''Superhuman Strength:''''' He possesses super-human strength (around 85 -90 tons), but nowhere near to the same level as the Hulk, a fact that he seems to be unable to accept.

*'''''Superhuman Durability:''''' The metallic-like composition of Ironclad body renders him highly resistant to physical injury. His body can resist extremely powerful impact forces, such as the force of the Hulk's punches (the Hulk can lift/press far above 100 tons making his punches devastatingly strong). His body can also withstand extreme temperatures ranging from -75 degrees to 800 degrees Fahrenheit for up to one hour before exposure or heat prostration occurs.

*'''''Mass/Density Manipulation:''''' The ability to increase or decrease his weight allowing him to hover in the air, or weigh as much as a mountain.

| Abilities               = 
'''Expert Pilot''': Michael "Mike" Steel is an exceptionally skilled and experienced pilot.

'''Rocket Scientist''': Michael built and piloted a space craft into the cosmic field that created him.

'''Master Combatant''': Ironclad is a good hand-to-hand combatant.

| Strength                = Strength Class 90
| Weaknesses              = An influx of cosmic radiation can cause a temporary loss of control to his density, causing Ironclad to increase in density until he sinks into the ground. However, it can also increase his strength exponentially, to the point that a collision with the Hulk generated a multiversal chaos.{{r|Incredible Hulk #305}} His teammate [[Vapor]] once melted his skin.{{Citation}}
