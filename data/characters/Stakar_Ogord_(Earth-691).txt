When [[Earth]] was attacked during the [[War of the Worlds]] in June 2001,{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #7}} the superhero [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-691)|Quasar]] rescued [[Ayesha (Earth-691)|Kismet]], pregnant with his child, and brought her to the monastery planet Vesper. Quasar was killed on his way back to Earth. As soon as Kismet gave birth,<ref>Kismet discovered she was pregnant while the war was in progress, presumably in July 2001. Therefore, she apparently gave birth to Stakar in late 2001 or early 2002</ref> her son was kidnapped by the evil creature [[Era]]{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy #62}} and deposited on [[Arcturus IV]]. He was found by [[Ogord (Earth-691)|Ogord]] of the Reavers, who raised him as his own and named him Stakar. At some point in his life, Stakar's adult mind was sent back in time and possessed his infant self. This cycle repeated many times, causing Stakar to live his life over and over.

Stakar grew up on Arcturus IV. He was a pacifist and a great disappointment to his adoptive family. He took an interest in archaeology.

Due to an accident, he was merged with [[Aleta Ogord (Earth-691)|Aleta Ogord]] and became Starhawk. They fled Ogord, married and had children. After they were reemerged, Stakar left their home and joined the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-691)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], helping to drive the Badoon off Earth,{{r|Defenders Vol 1 27}} because he sensed that the human girl known as [[Geena Drake (Earth-691)|Geena Drake]] would play a vital role in the future.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 14}} When the Guardians found themselves unable to fit into postwar civilian life, Starhawk led them on a mission to explore space.{{r|Marvel Presents #3}} During this time, he and Aleta fought for control of their common body, as she was trying to get him to return to their children who were in danger.{{r|Marvel Presents #4|7}}

Even as he kept making changes to his life, his memories seemed to change. Although he enjoyed being part of the Guardians, he seemed to only be concerned with himself. He forcibly re-merged with Aleta to keep himself alive, however, Aleta eventually overpowered him and separated herself once again.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 32|33}}

After the Guardians had altered [[Earth-691|their timeline]], this caused Stakar to relive his live over and over again. He and Aleta had an argument, but the Hawk God bonded them together by fusing their fingers together.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 45}} After being forced to work together, the Hawk God eventually granted their wishes and sepearated them, with Stakar retaining the power, while Aleta retained her light powers.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 50}}

After Aleta went with the Guardians, Hawk God revealed to Stakar the truth about his ancestry.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 51}} This caused Stakar to go on a quest to learn more, which lead him to an wounded [[Norrin Radd (Earth-691)|Silver Surfer]]. After healing him, Stakar got hold of the Surfer's [[Quantum Bands]], which were once worn by his biological father. He was eventually consumed by [[Abrogate (Earth-691)|Abrogate]], and went to the [[White Room (Protectors of the Universe)|White Room]] where all former wielders of the Quantum Bands went after death, and met his father. After Quasar told his son about his mother, Stakar was able find her on [[Vesper (Planet)|Vesper]]. However, Era came to them and revealed the he was responsible for taking Stakar away from Kismet, along with other vile deeds.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 60|61}} Following the Hawk God encouraging Stakar, he with his mother decided to confront Era in order to to fix the [[Multiverse|multiversal]] imbalance and the War of the Cosmic Entities.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 62}}

When Major Victory was stranded on Earth-616 and being attacked by [[Stakar Ogord (Earth-80923)|Starhawk]] of [[Earth-80923]],{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 3}} the main Starhawk briefly checked on Major Victory before disappearing.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 4}}

When the [[Incursion]] began destroying the [[Eighth Cosmos|eighth iteration]] of the Multiverse [[Michael Korvac (Earth-691)|Korvac]] used Geena to form a temporal instability causing the Guardians to be stuck in a timeloop.{{r|Guardians 3000 Vol 1 1}} As Korvac was unable to prevent the incursion as time was broken, causing Stakar to remerge with Aleta, and eventually they all faded away.{{r|Guardians 3000 Vol 1 8}}

| Powers                  = 
* The true extent of Starhawk's powers is unknown, but they are said to be immense in nature. He has an incredibly long lifespan, possibly inherited from his mother or due to his empowerment by the [[Hawk God]]: 
** '''Superhuman Strength:''' Stakar at times has demonstrated the capacity for superhuman strength. When he and Aleta were merged, Starhawk could tap her solid-light powers to reinforce his own light-based body, increasing his relative strength and durability. He became strong enough to battle [[Thor]] hand-to-hand for a short period.{{r|Thor Annual #6}} 
** '''Superhuman Speed:''' In spite of his great size, Stakar can run and move at speeds that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete.
** '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Stakar body grants him unlimited stamina and is, therefore, immune to fatigue.
** '''Superhuman Durability:''' Stakar's bodily tissues are much harder and far more resistant to physical injury than the bodily tissues of a normal human. Stakar is highly resistant to penetration wounds, even from high caliber machine gun shells. He can also withstand tremendous impact forces, such as falling from great heights or being repeatedly struck by superhumanly strong opponents, without being hurt.
** '''Superhuman Agility:''' Stakar's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are at levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.
** '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Stakar's reflexes are similarly superior to those of the finest human athlete.
** '''Immortality:''' For all intents and purposes, Stakar is functionally immortal. Because he no longer ages and he is immune to disease and infection. This same energy sustains his physical vitality far more efficiently than the biochemical process that sustains ordinary human life.
** '''Light Manipulation''': Starhawk can manipulate light to create concussive force blasts of photonic energy, heat, and solid-light constructs. By tapping into Aleta's powers (when merged with her), he can also generate solid constructs of light; it is unknown if he can do so since their separation.
** '''Flight''': Surrounding himself with intermingled photons and anti-gravitons, Starhawk can fly at great speeds, even exceeding the speed of light (although he never does so within a planetary atmosphere). He can fly at even greater speeds with his solar sails, a set of retractable glider wings which are part of his suit. Harnessing light waves and photonic particles from solar winds to augment his powers, they make his flights easier and faster
** '''Enhanced Senses''': His natural senses, especially eyesight, are enhanced to a superhuman degree; in addition, his powers give him extrasensory sensitivity to energy patterns and fluctuations in his environment, and he can track energy trails across intergalactic distances.
** '''Precognition''': He seemingly has precognition, designating himself as "One-Who-Knows", but this is actually an effect of remembering what happened in his previous life cycle. However, due to Starhawk's efforts to change events for the better in each cycle, as well as the manipulations of beings with greater understanding of the universe such as [[Mephisto]], these memories can become unreliable; the overall thrust of events may be the same, but vital details might differ from his previous incarnation.
** '''Umbrakinesis''': When he forced Aleta to re-merge with him after their second separation, Starhawk's power changed from light to dark, and he was able to create constructs out of solid darkness, and fire blasts of shadowy force. 

| Abilities                   = * '''Archaeology''': Stakar has knowledge of the archaeology of the planet [[Arcturus IV]]. He also has extensive knowledge of various civilizations throughout the [[Milky Way Galaxy]].
| Strength                    = 

| Equipment                   = * '''Starhawk's Suit:''' His suit is made of alien materials, including a retracting transparent face mask and life support system, and retractable solar wind collector wings.
| Transportation              = [[USS Captain America]], [[Drydock]], [[Freedom's Lady]], [[USS Captain America II]]

* Valentino had initially decided to call him Shadowhawk, but Tom DeFalco convinced him to save the name for a brand new character.{{citation}}
