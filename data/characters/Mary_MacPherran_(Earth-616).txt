===Early Life===
Mary MacPherran was born prematurely in a suburb of Denver, Colorado. Mary was often overlooked as the smallest of her siblings and would immerse herself in fantasy books. She grew little over the years, remaining short and scrawny compared to her peers; a popular girl at school named Vanessa Ashwood gave Mary the nickname "Skeeter" (a slang word for mosquito) because of this. Her only real friend was [[Marsha Rosenberg (Earth-616)|Marsha Rosenberg]], who was similarly unpopular (in her case for being awkward and overweight). Consistently mocked and humiliated since childhood by the wealthy Vanessa and her social clique, Mary (and Marsha) had to take menial jobs to survive. Mary grew bitter over her hard life, and fantasized about something improbable in her favor such as winning the lottery. These fantasies soon turned to gaining superpowers to be admired, and to exact revenge on her tormentors.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 1 10}}

[[File:Mary MacPherran (Earth-616) from She-Hulk Vol 1 10 002.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Dreaming about fame and fortune]]
When the second Spider-Woman [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Julia Carpenter]] began to make appearances in Denver, Rosenberg remarked that her hair was the same color as Mary's. Mary falsely confided in her friend that she was secretly Spider-Woman, and when Rosenberg spread the rumor, Mary saw her popularity grow and was invited to a party by Vanessa and her clique.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 1 10}}

===Secret Wars===
In the midst of the party, however, their suburb of Denver was ripped from Earth and used by the alien [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] to create the makeshift planet [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]]. When the real Spider-Woman arrived on the scene and saved the guests from falling debris, Vanessa and her friends realized they'd been duped and chased MacPherran and Rosenberg into the forests of Battleworld. Frightened and exhausted, the two young women were found by the villain [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], who was looking for recruits for his army of supervillains; he offered the girls the chance of gaining superhuman powers, and they accepted Doom's offer.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 1 10}}

[[File:Mary MacPherran (Earth-616) from She-Hulk Vol 1 10 003.jpg|180px|thumb|left|The birth of Titania]]
Doom recreated both women using highly advanced alien technologies found in the aptly named "Doombase", which were powered by immense energies from a ferocious alien storm outside. Able to use the technology entirely as he desired, Doom induced high-level metahuman abilities of a specific and particular design. While Rosenberg (now known as Volcana) received a fiery form composed of ionized plasma, MacPherran became far taller, muscular, and more buxom than average. She now had an incredibly high level of superhuman strength and durability, but the change also affected her mentality. Where Mary MacPherran had been small and timid, the newly-named Titania was proud and confident, perhaps to extremes. Soon after, she challenged [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Carl Creel]], the Absorbing Man, to a fight, but he refused, reasoning that he had "nothing to prove...to a dame."{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 3}}

The time did come for her to try her new powers in battle, first against [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] (marking the beginning of a long rivalry between the two), and then against [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], but during both fights Titania realized that strenght wouldn't be enough to defeat her enemies and that her arrogance was getting the best of her.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 1 10}}{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 8}}

After her run-in with Spider-Man, she grew close with Absorbing Man, who tried to sheer her up,{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 11}} and, after she decided to deliver payback against Vanessa for the years of abuse, she was talked out of going further by Creel.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 1 10}}

===Return to Earth===
The pair did not settle down to the quiet life, instead joining [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] and his latest incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]]. Their first assignment was to recruit the powerful [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Moonstone]] into the group.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 270}} Later on, Zemo kept them at large to field new recruits, which prevented them from joining the main group in the assault on [[Avengers Mansion]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 273|274}} To kill time, Titania robbed a jewelry store, only to come to the attention of Spider-Man; too afraid to fight, she ran from combat, only to encounter the hero again in LaGuardia Airport. There, once more Titania tried not to fight, having Creel do so on her behalf; yet the sight of his near-defeat at Spider-Man's hands was enough for Titania to temporarily overcome her arachnophobia, charging into combat. It was a moot point, though, since Creel ended the fight by threatening to destroy a plane full of innocents if Spider-Man refused to leave the scene, which he reluctantly did.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 283}}

[[File:Masters of Evil (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 273 001.jpg|200px|thumb|right|With the Masters of Evil]]
The villainous couple received another assignment from the Masters: this time, they were to kill the Avenger [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], who had been gravely injured previously by the Masters, and was in a coma in hospital. Hercules was saved by a guard of only the diminutive heroes [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] and [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|The Wasp]]; Creel was stung by the Wasp as he switched from liquid to human form, and Titania was shrunk to the size of an insect and then blasted through a wall by Wasp. The villains were easily subdued, with Titania taken to the [[Vault]], a superhuman penitentiary.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 275}}

===The Vault===
Titania's stay in the Vault was not to last long, however. When Tony Stark, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], began the Armor Wars - the battle to destroy or disable all enhanced armor types based on stolen Iron Man designs - this inevitably led him to the [[Guardsmen (Earth-616)|Guardsmen]], the Vault's wardens. The ensuing conflict, while successful from his point of view, created a power failure, allowing Titania and [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mister Hyde]] to escape. While [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], then known as The Captain, managed to subdue and capture Mister Hyde, his colleague [[Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616)|Demolition Man]] was humiliated when he tried to apprehend the far stronger Titania; when allowed the opportunity for a rematch later, a scared Demolition Man simply let the villainess escape.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 340}}

Using her newfound freedom, Titania traveled to Washington D.C., where she wrecked havok to attract She-Hulk's attention for a rematch. After losing a succession of battles with She-Hulk, however, Titania promised to never attack her again, and to return to jail.{{r|Solo Avengers Vol 1 14}}

===Frightful Four===
Broken out yet again, Titania joined with the [[Wizard]], [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Klaw]], and [[Morris Bench (Earth-616)|Hydro-Man]], to become the new [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]]. Battling the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], the team only won due to help from [[Draconus (Earth-616)|Dragon Man]], Professor Gregson Gilbert's creation, and [[Aron]], a renegade Watcher; in the rematch, the Fantastic Four prevailed, only to have both Fours imprisoned by Aron in suspended animation, using clones of the Fantastic Four to act out adventures he wished to witness. When both teams were freed, Aron chose to witness the dreams of his clones instead, transporting the Frightful Four back to the Vault as a service to the Fantastic Four.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 326|329}}

===Acts of Vengeance===
However, this stay in The Vault was as permanent as earlier ones - a conspiracy between [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] and the Wizard, among other villains, saw Titania free once more, as part of Loki's Acts of Vengeance plan. Teaming supervillains to fight enemies not usually their own, Titania was dismayed when Doctor Doom, her partner, told her she would face not She-Hulk, but Spider-Man. Doom managed to stoke Titania's pride and anger, allowing her to overcome her fear and engage Spider-Man; unfortunately, Spider-Man had temporarily bonded with the Uni-Power, making him [[Captain Universe]]. This granted him the power to render Titania unconscious in one massive energy discharge; the only benefit of the situation was that Titania had lost her fear of Spider-Man.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 59}}

This time, Titania did not even make it back to the Vault; she was freed by [[Franklin Hall (Earth-616)|Graviton]], who also collected the [[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Trapster]] and the [[Brothers Grimm]], all of whom had been humiliated by Spider-Man in his Captain Universe guise. Along with [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]] and [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Goliath]], they attempted to take revenge, only to fail; Titania was humiliatingly defeated by a collision with a speeding bus.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 64|65}}

===Reunion With the Absorbing Man===
Escaping the Vault once again, Titania, ever the team player, joined Superia's all-female army the [[Femizons (Earth-616)|Femizons]], as foes of Captain America and [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]].{{r|Captain America Vol 1 389|391}} This did not work out, however, and so Titania resolved to track down her old flame - the Absorbing Man. She interfered with a battle between him and [[Eric Masterson (Earth-616)|Eric Masterson]], who was Thor at the time, and, when she appeared injured by a blow from Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir]], Creel admitted his love for her, which she gladly reciprocated. Seeing this, Thor allowed them to leave.{{r|Thor Vol 1 436}}

While Creel made an attempt to live a normal life, Titania was more concerned with getting payback from She-Hulk and robbing jewelry stores; concerned, Creel attempted to "scare her straight", collaborating with Thor in a ploy involving a Guggenheim exhibit. While the appearance of Spider-Man and special police unit [[Code: Blue (Earth-616)|Code: Blue]] complicated matters, Titania ultimately remembered her love for Creel.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk Vol 1 49}}{{r|Thor Vol 1 447|448}}

Drawn to an [[A.I.M.]] convention in [[Boca Caliente]], Titania joined with the [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Abomination]] and [[Edward Cobert (Earth-616)|Gargantua]] to battle the Town Called Hulk;{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #19}} once this was done, Titania came to her senses somewhat, asking Creel to marry her. The wedding was attended by many supervillains; while the Avengers interrupted the ceremony, they left the couple alone.{{r|Avengers: Unplugged Vol 1 4}} In their new life, the pair seemed not to be able to stay under the radar, assuming the guises of Thunder Girl and Lightning Bolt in order to hunt Spider-Man for the reward offered by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]. Despite contracting severe skin burns as a result of this escapade, this was not the end of the pair's villainy; committing more robberies, Titania also clashed repeatedly with She-Hulk again.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 429}}

===Illness & Recuperation===
However, this was not a permanent state of affairs; despite her enhanced durability, Titania contracted a terminal illness: [[Glossary:Cancer|cancer]]. Without health insurance and no money, she was quickly forced to move from the hospital to an abandoned building.{{r|Thor Vol 2 25|27}} Slowly weakening, but still massively strong, she fought through the illness with the help of doctors provided by Thor; as a result, the Absorbing Man repented to Thor, bowing to the new Lord of Asgard.{{r|Thor Vol 2 55}}

===Power Gem===
Still, Titania proved unable to stay away from She-Hulk, and underwent an intense physical regimen to boost her abilities. Unbeknownst to her, She-Hulk's strength levels were also higher than ever before. Battered and inadvertently humiliated by her, Titania was offered the chance at revenge after obtaining the [[Power Stone|Power Gem]], one of the legendary [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Gems]], from its former owner, the former [[Tryco Slatterus (Earth-616)|Champion of the Universe]].{{r|She-Hulk Vol 1 10}}

[[File:She-Hulk Vol 1 11 Textless.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Beating She-Hulk]]
He had agreed to cease using the Power Gem as a condition of his defeat at the hand of She-Hulk, but was free to gain his own revenge by proxy through Titania. After an initial defeat by the newly-empowered Titania, She-Hulk tricked her into believing that she had killed her in a second battle; Titania's initial rush of triumph suddenly melted into uncertainty, as she realized that her life now had no meaning or focus without the object of her obsessive hatred.With Titania no longer having a profound desire for more power, She-Hulk was able to claim the gem for herself and use its power to knock Titania out with a single punch.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 1 11|12}}

Titania was later incarcerated in the [[Big House|Lang Memorial Penitentiary]], a.k.a. the Pym Experimental Prison #2, a prison in which superhuman inmates were shrunk with Pym particles to less than an inch in height.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 1 12}}

===Civil War===
Still shrunken to her diminutive form, she was reunited with her husband Creel, clashing again with She-Hulk. While shrunk, she was grabbed by [[Jazinda Kl'rt-Spawn (Earth-616)|Jazinda]] (a female [[Skrull]]) and thrown to a shark, who ate her.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 2 22|23}} Titania survived this somehow, as she encountered [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations]]{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 204}} and was later at the [[Raft]], commenting along with other female inmates on the prowess of the new warden [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]].{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 144}}

===Fear Itself===
[[File:Mary MacPherran (Earth-616) and Skirn (Earth-616) from Fear Itself Vol 1 2 0001.png|thumb|right|180px|Skirn: Breaker of Men]]
When the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]] was freed by [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Skadi]], he called seven hammers to Earth. Titania was transformed by one of these hammers, becoming one of the Worthy: Skirn, Breaker of Men. She then set off with the Absorbing Man to find the Hammer destined for him.{{r|Fear Itself #3|7}}

Following the final battle with the Serpent, the hammer of Titania is taken from her as well as the other hammers of the other Worthy. She was then returned to the [[Raft]] where she suffered a nervous breakdown, and claimed `they` were going to take her hammer, moments before [[Sin]]'s forces attacked.{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #5}}

===Illuminati===
After one too many times of getting caught by the Avengers and imprisoned, Titania decided to go legit and stop her criminal career. She was released from prison on parole, and managed to convince the Absorbing Man to reluctantly promise to follow her footsteps once he got out as well. However, her past didn't help in trying to live a normal life, having trouble finding a job, and a decent lifestyle.{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 1}}
[[File:Illuminati Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|180px|thumb|left|With the Illuminati]]
She-Hulk managed to get her a job at a pawnshop, which was shortly thereafter assaulted by a band of robbers. While Titania used her powers to stop the robbers, the pawnshop owner blamed her for the attack, and Titania ultimately came to blows with Luke Cage and Iron Fist, displaying new levels of powers. She was rescued by the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]], the person who had secretly set up the robbery in the first place, and managed to convince her to return to her life of crime, and become a member of his [[Illuminati (Hood's) (Earth-616)|Illuminati]].{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 1}}

Following a failed attempt at stealing [[Asgardian]] weapons,{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 2|5}} the Hood helped Titania rescue Absorbing Man from a prison known as [[Pleasant Hill]], but she remained hesitant to trust the Hood, after discovering he had secretly upgraded her powers. When Robbins tried to amass an army with the villains that had been imprisoned at Pleasant Hill, he proposed to target the families of their enemies. Titania confronted Robbins, believing that to be a line that shouldn't be crossed. During an ensuing discussion, the Hood revealed to Titania that he had set her up to lose her job. Mary forced the Hood to teleport them away from their pase, and during a fight, she defeated him and destroyed his cloak, losing reverting to her previous level of power. When the police arrived to the scene, Titania realized that it was impossible for her to live a normal life, and decided to embrace her criminal career together with the Absorbing Man.{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 7}}

===Black Bolt===
Sometime later Titania was told of her husband's heroic sacrifice by the Inhuman [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] and alien telepath [[Blinky (Earth-616)|Blinky]]. She mourned his death and arranged his funeral, which was attended by Captain America, Thor, and the Wrecking Crew. After the funeral, Black Bolt was attacked by [[Lash (Earth-616)|Lash]]. Titania helped fought off the Inhuman villains, but was unable to prevent them from kidnapping Blinky.{{r|Black Bolt Vol 1 9}} Soon the [[Jailer (Inhuman) (Earth-616)|Jailer]] possessed Blinky's mind in order to kill Black Bolt, so [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]] took Titania to Parkwood Cemetery where Absorbing Man suddenly emerged from his grave. Absorbing Man and Titania helped Black Bolt fight a Jailer-possessed Blinky until they managed to drive Jailer out of her.{{r|{{cl|Black Bolt Vol 1 11}}-[[Black Bolt Vol 1 12|12]]}}

===Immortal Hulk===
After her husband had joined [[Gamma Flight (Alpha Flight Space Program) (Earth-616)|Gamma Flight]], she reunited with him and also joined the team. Following [[Shadow Base Site A|Shadow Base]]'s latest attack on the Hulk, Gamma Flight retrieved [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]]'s [[Gamma-Activated Tissue|Abomination shell]]. However, as Titania and Carl were having a conversation, [[Reginald Fortean (Earth-616)|General Fortean]] in the [[Redeemer Armor]] broke in and incapacitated them with the rest of the team and stole the shell. After recovering themselves, they found out that their teammate, [[Walter Langkowski (Earth-616)|Dr. Langkowski]] had been killed by Fortean. They the decided to attack Shadow Base and during the attack, they were joined by Hulk, [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Harpy]], Rick Jones and [[Jacqueline McGee (Earth-616)|Jackie McGee]]. However, they were eventually overwhelmed by Fortean as the new Abomination and his soldiers. The battle ended when Hulk killed General Fortean and took control of Hulk Operations.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 18|24}}

Titania and Gamma Flight later aided Hulk and his allies in fighting monsters sent to wreak havoc in [[Phoenix (Arizona)|Phoenix]], [[Arizona (State)|Arizona]] by [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]]. Titania took down one of the monsters by shoving a large ball of steel bars into its mouth.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 30|31}}

[[File:Mary MacPherran (Earth-616) from Immortal Hulk Vol 1 36 001.jpg|thumb|right|180px]]
After Hulk destroyed a surrounding area and killed many people in a gamma blast, Titania and Gamma Flight arrived to apprehend him. Creel restrained Hulk while draining him of gamma energy. Hulk at first didn't fight back until Titania pushed down Jackie McGee who didn't want the press there out of fear for their safety. Hulk flew into a rage and ripped off Creel's arm and punched him into the ground. Titania battled Hulk, smashing him through a power shovel and pummeling him. Despite that, she was defeated by Hulk. Fearing for Titania's safety, Creel decided to absorb the surrounding gamma energy, transforming into a gamma-powered giant.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 36}}

As Creel battled Hulk, Rick, who was being controlled by the [[Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)|Leader]], showed signs of this control. This aroused Titania's suspicion, and she confronted Rick. Leader responded by swatting at Titania through Rick. When Titania tried attacking Rick, Rick was teleported away. Hulk was then severely injured by Puck after Creel pinned him down with a windstorm.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 37|38}}

Hulk was taken in custody and held in prisoner in Alpha Flight's [[Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station|space station]], but he was able to escape right in front of Gamma Flight by smashing open one of the space station's windows.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 40}} He and Titania later quit Gamma Flight when Alpha Flight's new commander [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Gyrich]] became too obnoxious to work for, especially when Gyrich threatened to have Creel arrested.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 42}}

Titania and Creel later rejoined Gamma Flight and teleported to [[Manhattan]] to aid Hulk and his estranged wife [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Betty]] in their fight with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. During the fight, Titania was eager to fight She-Hulk, but She-Hulk decided to aid her cousin after talking with Betty. Gamma Flight then teleported away to a warehouse in [[Brooklyn]] with Hulk, Betty, and She-Hulk, though Titania was reluctant to have She-Hulk tag along due to their past altercations.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 47}}

Due to choosing to aid Hulk instead of apprehend him, Gamma Flight became wanted by the Alpha Flight Space Program and forced to go on the run. Samson, Absorbing Man, Titania, and Puck later teleported to [[Austin]], [[Texas (State)|Texas]] to stop a Gamma Mutate running amuck. Samson was able to talk down the mutate and learned that her name was [[Dionne Fortean (Earth-616)|Dionne]] but was called Stockpile by the organization she escaped from, [[Green Spring (Earth-616)|Green Spring]]. While Titania fought with the [[Austin Police Department (Earth-616)|Austin Police Department]], Puck and Absorbing Man were teleported by Dr. McGowan but was unable to teleport Stockpile as well. After that, Skaar appeared seemingly repowered to retrieve Stockpile for Green Spring.{{r|Gamma Flight Vol 1 1}}

Skaar went on the attack, and Titania and Samson were eventually able to restrain Skaar with help from Dionne. Later, Creel and Puck were able to arrive after Creel used his powers to turn himself into a translocator. When the [[United States Hulkbuster Force (Earth-616)|United States Hulkbuster Force]] arrived to break up the fight, Skaar focused his attention on them. When Gamma Flight and Dionne tried teleporting away through Creel, damage done to Creel by Skaar caused a malfunction that seemingly caused them to disintegrate.{{r|Gamma Flight Vol 1 2}}

Gamma Flight and Dionne were transported to an astral plane-like dimension for gamma energy connected to the [[Below-Place]]. After fighting off gamma-mutated creatures and zombies, Dionne revealed that they were in [[Thomasville]], [[Texas (State)|Texas]] where Green Spring conducted experiments with gamma mutation that turned the citizens into zombies. They then met [[Reginald Fortean (Earth-616)|General Fortean]]'s spirit who revealed that someone was using his identity to use Green Spring to create an army of gamma mutates. Then everyone was teleported to Gamma Flight's hideout by [[Charlene McGowan (Earth-616)|Dr. McGowan]].{{r|Gamma Flight Vol 1 3}}

| Powers                  = Due to undergoing Doctor Doom's mutagenic alteration process, Titania possesses various superhuman physical attributes.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 13}}

'''Superhuman Strength:''' Titania possesses vast superhuman strength that has increased over the years due to intensive weight training. Titania was originally strong enough to lift about 85 tons and she can now lift about 100 tons.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 13}}

'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Titania's highly advanced musculature generates considerably less fatigue toxins than ordinary humans. She can physically exert herself at peak capacity for about 24 hours, before the build up of fatigue toxins in her bloodstream begins to impair her.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 13}}

'''Superhuman Durability:''' Titania's body is highly resistant to physical injury. She is capable of withstanding high caliber bullets, falls from great heights, tremendous impact force, and temperatures as high as 1,500 degrees Celsius and as low as -120 degrees Celsius without sustaining injury.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 13}}
