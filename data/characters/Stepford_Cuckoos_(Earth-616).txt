===Origin===
After the confrontation with [[Trevor Fitzroy (Earth-1191)|Trevor Fitzroy]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] was plunged into a coma for a year.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #281|284}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #310}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #316}} During her unconscious state, [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Dr. John Sublime]] harvested over 1000 eggs from her to begin experimentation.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 3}}

[[File:X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Genetically engineered by [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus]]]]
The [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus program]] then used the eggs to create thousands of identical [[Homo superior|mutant]] girls in the hope of developing a powerful weapon capable of killing every mutant on [[Earth]] by combining their [[Telepathy|telepathic abilities]]. The project was designated '''[[Weapon XIV]]''' and the girls were incubated and artificially aged inside the subterranean level of [[The World (Weapon Plus)|The World]].{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #4}} While most girls remained dormant, five were sent to infiltrate the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] as student sisters to hone their talents for Sublime's purpose.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #3}}{{r|New X-Men #118}}

===Xavier Institute===
After the Xavier Institute went public,{{r|New X-Men #117}} the orphan quintuplet sisters [[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]], [[Phoebe Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Phoebe]], [[Irma Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Mindee]], [[Celeste Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Celeste]], and [[Esme Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Esme]] were enrolled.{{r|New X-Men #118}} To protect their secret origins, the girls unconsciously placed mental blocks in the minds of the faculty, preventing them from investigating their background.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #2}}

[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 1 134 001.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The Stepford Cuckoos strutting in the halls of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Institute]]]] 

The girls quickly gained the moniker "'''The Stepford Cuckoos'''", though their chosen codename was the '''Five-In-One'''. Emma Frost assisted the girls when Esme had a crush on a student who turned out to be [[Stuff (Earth-616)|Stuff]], an advanced guard of the [[Shi'ar]].{{r|New X-Men #123}} This sparked Emma to take a special interest in the girls, and the Cuckoos becoming her protégés.{{r|New X-Men #126}}{{r|New X-Men #134}} As gifted telepaths, they were registered into [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]]'s psychic course along with their rival [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]].{{r|New X-Men #134}}

[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 1 137 0001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]] leading the Five-In-One against [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Kid Omega]] on Open Day]] 

Quire developed a crush on Sophie, but the Cuckoos considered him to be odd and completely rejected him. Sparked by his uncontrolled powers and learning that he was adopted, and fueled by use of the drug [[Hypercortisone D|Kick]], Kid Omega led a rebellion of students at the X-Mansion. To stop Kid Omega and his [[Omega Gang (Earth-616)|Omega Gang]], Sophie and the other Cuckoos covertly snuck into [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]]. Using Kick to amp up her powers, Sophie and her sisters were able to stop Quire. Unfortunately, Sophie died in the process.{{r|New X-Men #134|137}} Unbeknownst to the others, Sophie was actually being influenced into these actions by Esme, who was also using Kick.{{r|New X-Men #141}}

With the death of Sophie, the Five-In-One became the '''Four-In-One'''. The girls were furious with Emma Frost, whom they blamed for Sophie's death. To exact their revenge, they informed [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] of the psychic affair between Emma and [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]].{{r|New X-Men #138}}

Not long after Sophie's death, Esme attempted to murder Emma by shooting her with a diamond bullet. While [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] and [[Sage (Earth-616)|Sage]] investigated the murder, Esme fled the X-Mansion fearing that the truth would be revealed about her involvement in the deaths of Sophie and Emma. Fortunately, Emma was saved by the combined efforts of [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] and Jean Grey with the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]].{{r|New X-Men #139|141}}

When Esme returned, it was alongside her lover, [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]], posing as [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and his [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Mutants]]. Esme and Xorn had both become mentally unstable through excessive use of Kick. When Xorn's affection was withheld from her, Esme turned on him, and Xorn killed her by burying her metal earrings in her brain.{{r|New X-Men #146|150}} With the departure and later death of Esme, the Four-In-One became the '''Three-In-One'''.{{r|New X-Men #149}}

The girls were among the [[Xavier Institute student body|students]] temporarily relocated to an [[X-Corporation (Earth-616)|X-Corp building]] in [[Salem Center]] while the Institute was being rebuilt.{{r|New X-Men #155}} It was here that Mindee's first boyfriend, [[Germaine Caruso (Earth-616)|Germaine]], died during an anti-mutant riot.{{r|New X-Men #156}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 13}}

[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 15 0001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Three-In-One as students in the [[Corsairs Squad (Earth-616)|Corsairs Squad]]]]
When the Institute was rebuilt under the leadership of co-headmasters Cyclops and Emma Frost, the students were organized into several [[X-Men Training Squads (Earth-616)|training squads]], each with an assigned mentor staff member.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #1|3}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 157}} The Three-In-One was assigned to the [[Corsairs Squad (Earth-616)|Corsairs Squad]] under the tutelage of Cyclops, with the girls serving equally as co-leaders of the squad.{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}

When [[Edward Tancredi (Earth-616)|Wing]] was injured from his altercation with [[Ord (SWORD) (Earth-616)|Ord]], the Cuckoos summoned [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]] to heal him.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 5}}

[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from X-Men Phoenix Endsong Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] considering the Stepford Cuckoos as potential hosts]]

When the Phoenix Force returned to Earth in search of a new host, it briefly considered the girls along with Kid Omega and Emma Frost before resurrecting Jean Grey.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Endsong #1}} The Phoenix Force awoke Kid Omega, still in love with Sophie, and he exhumed her in hopes of reuniting with her.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Endsong #2}}{{r|X-Men Phoenix Endsong #4}} However, upon her resurrection, she promptly rejected Quire and died again.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Endsong #5}} While the X-Men rushed to intercept the Phoenix, the Cuckoos remained in Cerebra as communication central.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Phoenix Endsong Vol 1 3}}-[[X-Men Phoenix Endsong Vol 1 5|5]]}}

===M-Day===
On [[Decimation|M-Day]] the vast majority of the world's mutant population was depowered. The Cuckoos retained their powers, but they were three of only twenty-seven students to retain their powers. Fearing for the students' safety, Emma Frost ordered that the depowered students and staff leave the Institute. For their safety, the depowered students were brought through the [[Alley|Morlock Tunnels]] to an awaiting bus. Unfortunately, the bus of depowered students was bombed by anti-mutant zealot [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Rev. William Stryker]], killing forty-two of the former students on board.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 24}}

The remaining students were placed by Emma Frost into an all-out brawl, and the ones deemed the best by Emma would become a group of [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]] in-training. This entire exercise was met with disgust by the Three-In-One, who promptly informed Cyclops of Emma's actions.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 23}}

===Warsong===
When an unstable fraction of the Phoenix Force sparked inside the girls, their dormant Weapon Plus nanotech inside their bones was activated. This nanotech briefly reanimated Sophie and Esme, who directed their sisters back to The World to activate Sublime's plan for the destruction of the [[Homo superior|mutant race]].{{r|{{cl|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #2}}-[[X-Men Phoenix Warsong #5|5]]}}
[[File:X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 5 Textless.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Stepford Cuckoo Phoenixes]]

The Phoenix and Sublime both wrestled for control of the Cuckoos when the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] arrived. Phoebe and Mindee were captured and integrated into Sublime's machine, but the Phoenix was able to possess Celeste. When Celeste was finally merged into the machine, the Phoenix was divided between all the Cuckoos and trapped in their newly emerged second mutation: organic diamond hearts. This event finally activated the '''Thousand-In-One'''.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #2}}-[[X-Men Phoenix Warsong #5|5]]}}

Celeste continued to resist the Phoenix and Sublime's machine long enough for the X-Men to forcibly disconnect them. However, in a rage, Phoebe triggered a power surge causing an explosion. However, Celeste was able take full control of the Phoenix, destroyed her sisters, and trapped the Phoenix fragments inside the Three-In-One's flawless diamond hearts, rendering them emotionless.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #5}}

After returning to the Institute, the girls adopted a rebellious/mischievous streak. They helped Elixir telepathically gain a PhD level knowledge of science and biology from Beast's brain.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 38}} Along with the other students, they were pulled into [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]], where they were rescued by [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|Prodigy]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #37|41}} To repay his kindness, the Cuckoos restored all of the knowledge he had previously gained with the use of his powers, despite his powers being deactivated.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}} When the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] came to the Institute to attack Professor X, the Stepford Cuckoos used [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]] to contact other X-teams such as [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] and [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations]] for assistance.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men 2}} The sisters were briefly considered as potential candidate recruits for the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]].{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report #1}}

After the birth of the first mutant since M-Day, the Stepford sisters were stationed in Cerebra to search for the baby and acting as central communication for the various X-squads.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 206}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 494}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 27}}

===Utopia===
The Stepford Cuckoos rejoined the X-Men and the last of mutantkind in [[San Francisco]]. During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], they assisted in the evacuation of a San Francisco Hospital, and later offered remote support to Emma while was bringing down the [[Skrulls]]' psychic blockade.{{r|{{cl|Secret Invasion: X-Men Vol 1 1}}-[[Secret Invasion: X-Men Vol 1 4|4]]}}
[[File:Joshua Foley (Earth-616) and Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) in X-Force Vol 3 7 001.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The Three-In-One offering to wipe [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]]'s memories of [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]]]]

The Cuckoos aided Elixir and the [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] briefly when Elixir wanted to depart the team. Out of loyalty to Cyclops, they agreed to maintain X-Force's secret status.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}}

Once they relocated to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], the Stepford Cuckoos frequently manned Cerebra.{{r|Nation X #2}}{{r|Generation Hope #9}} When [[Lobe (Earth-616)|Lobe]] and [[John Greycrow (Earth-616)|Scalphunter]] with a group of [[Predator X|Predator Xs]] attacked Utopia, the X-Men were forced to battle the mutant eating creatures. The Cuckoos served as telepathic communication for the team, but during the battle the Phoenix fragments that were contained inside their diamond hearts escaped, and mysteriously returned to space, leaving the girls unconscious.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #517}}

When the girls recovered from their coma, they recruited [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] to borrow their telepathy to help search for the Phoenix, but with no luck.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #234}} Later the girls fell into a depressive funk due to the loss of their Phoenix powers.{{r|Nation X #4}}

While on a brief trip to [[Manhattan]], the girls beat [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] to thwarting a bank robbery.{{r|X-Men: To Serve and Protect #2}}

Although not on the active roster for any one team, the Stepford Cuckoos continued to offer remote telepathic and Cerebra-based support for Cyclops, the X-Men,{{r|X-Force Vol 3 27}}{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Schism Vol 1 2}}-[[X-Men: Schism Vol 1 4|4]]}} X-Force,{{r|X-Force Vol 3 19}} [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]] and her [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]],{{r|Generation Hope #9}} [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]],{{r|Magneto: Not a Hero #3}} and the [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|Extinction Team]].

When the [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (Earth-616)|Chaos King]] put all of the living to sleep and opened the underworld, both Sophie and Esme were among the resurrected.{{r|Chaos War: X-Men #1}} Although tension ran high between the two, they were able to help defeat the [[Carrion Crow (Earth-616)|Carrion Crow]] and resolve some of the issues surrounding their deaths.{{r|Chaos War: X-Men #2}}

===Schism===
After Cyclops and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] decided to part ways, Phoebe wanted to return to [[Westchester County|Westchester]] while Mindee wanted to remain on Utopia. With the deciding vote left to Celeste, she opted to stay on Utopia, partly because of Quentin Quire's presence at the school.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}}{{r|X-Men: Schism #5}} 
[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from Generation Hope Vol 1 13 0001.jpg|right|250px|thumb|On Utopia]]

When the Phoenix Force returned to Earth searching for a new host leading to the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|war]] between the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and the X-Men, the Stepford Cuckoos were among the younger X-Men detained in the [[Avengers Compound]] with the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]].{{r|Avengers Academy #30|33}} Afterward, they were reluctantly recruited to the new [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School]], where they manned Cerebra and witnessed the death of Professor X and the reemergence of mutantkind.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #12}}{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #18}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 19}} 

The girls were very displeased with the new school.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #15}} When Cyclops and his X-Men came to the school looking for recruits to their mutant rebellion, the Stepford sisters and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] volunteered to go.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 4}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 5|5]]}}

===Mutant Revolution===
The girls joined and assisted Cyclops' team as the resident telepaths, since Emma's powers were broken.{{r|All-New X-Men #3}}{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #36}} During this time, Irma dyed her hair black and expressed that she wished to attain more individuality.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 9}} Phoebe entertained the thought of doing the same, and eventually dyed hers red.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 17}} Although Celeste was upset, Emma was supportive of her choice as well.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 9}}

Later, following an attack from the future Brotherhood of Mutants, the Stepford Cuckoos and Emma Frost combined their telepathic abilities in an effort to defeat Xorn (Jean Grey). Although they were initially able to hold their own, they were all defeated, leaving Xorn to continue the psychic duel with her younger counterpart.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 12}}

[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from X-Men Gold Vol 2 6 001.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Different hair colors]]
After [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] disbanded the New Xavier School and requested that the students enroll in the Jean Grey School, the Cuckoos, along with the other students, were outraged. They assisted [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]] in capturing [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] by mentally penetrating her psychic shields and making her believe that Dazzler was Cyclops, luring her into a trap. Later, the sisters and [[David Bond (Earth-616)|David]] concocted a plan to not join the other school and create their own group.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 34}}

The students appeared at a high school to stop an angry mutant, Blake, who had the power to summon demons. The Cuckoos shifted into their diamond form and simultaneously used their telepathy to hinder Blake's assault on her mutant-hating father. During the onslaught, Celeste was injured, but was quickly healed by [[Christopher Muse (Earth-616)|Triage]]. This battle made [[Fabio Medina (Earth-616)|Goldballs]] an internet sensation until the public found out he was a mutant and was injured by a glass bottle. Enraged, the Cuckoos nearly kill the mutant-hating attacker. After this, they finally decided to join the Jean Grey School and admit to [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] that they were not ready for the world and the world was not ready for them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 35}}

===House of X===
After more than a year, the Cuckoos returned to their natural hair color and matching costumes.{{r|X-23 Vol 4 1}} And, eventually, they joined the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], acting as psychic emissaries for the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] ambassadors invited to the [[Jerusalem Habitat]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}} Thanks to the resurrection abilities of The Five on Krakoa, Sophie and Esme joined the Cuckoos once again.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 2}}

==Powers and Abilities==
===Powers===
The Stepford Cuckoos are [[Homo superior|mutants]] with [[Telepathy|psychically]] based powers similar to their biological mother, [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]. The girls have demonstrated the following powers:
[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 41 0001.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Three-In-One activating their telepathy]]
'''Telepathic Hive Mind:''' The Stepford Cuckoos have a linked hive mind, which allows them to share thoughts and maintain a continuous telepathic connection. The link is strongest when the girls are in close physical proximity. This mental phalanx also allows for increased telepathic strength and shared intellect. The girls' powers are greater the sum of its parts. A stronger personality can take lead of the hive mind, but the girls still maintain their independence.[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 206 0001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Three-In-One telepathically using [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]]]]
* '''[[Telepathy]]:''' The Cuckoos can read minds and project their thoughts to others. Though they individually possess their own telepathy, but their telepathic abilities are greater when the girls join together.{{r|New X-Men #119}} The girls have stated that together they can block even very talented telepaths from reading their minds.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}}
** '''[[Illusions|Telepathic Illusion]]:''' The Cuckoos can create realistic psychic illusions and cause people to experience events which are not actually occurring.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #1}}{{r|Nation X #4}}
** '''Mind Alteration:''' The Cuckoos are able to alter the minds of others by force of will. This can be restoring memories{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}} or transferring knowledge.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 38}}
** '''Telepathic Tracking:''' The Cuckoos' psionic senses enable them to detect and track other sentient beings by their unique psionic emanations or thought patterns. This ability is highly sensitive to proximity, but can be enhanced with the use of [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]].
** '''[[Astral Projection]]:''' The Cuckoos are capable of sending astral projections, astral travel, and communicating with others astrally through their own will, or through contact with the thoughts and memories of others.
** '''Mental Paralysis:''' The Cuckoos are able to effect certain areas of the brain to induce temporary mental or physical paralysis.
** '''Mental Amnesia:''' The Cuckoos can erase any awareness of particular memories or cause total amnesia.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}} They can also restore memories.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}}
** '''Mental Triangulation:''' Due to their hive mind, the Cuckoos have the perspective of three directions and are able to triangulate on individuals' minds.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #234}}
[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 35 0001.png|thumb|left|240px|The Cuckoos in their diamond form {{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 35}}]]
* '''Gestalt Psychic Link:''' The Cuckoos shared ability to merge their psionic engrams together and merge individual telepathic powers as one enables the acquisition of far greater psychic capability than the sum of its parts. When the central of the hive, Sophie; was the dominant consciousness. She often commanded the Cuckoos governing their every action and deed.{{r|New X-Men #134}}{{r|Chaos War: X-Men #1}} As it was by the time when Esme took command of their odd union.<ref>{{r|X-23 Vol 4 1}}-[[X-23 Vol 4 5|5]]</ref> After the two dominant personas of the conglomerate died off, the remaining three of the bunch operated the gestalt in a democratic fashion instead of one appointed lead Cuckoo.
** '''Collective Super-mind:''' Through the meld, these three-thousand young mutants are capable of using their powers in unison with each other in becoming a hive-mind to not only be capable of broadening and strengthening their natural telepathic skill & reach. But they also gain a prodigious intellectual enhancement as well.{{citation}} Allowing the sisters to work together to manipulate vast amounts of cognitive and perceptive facilities on top of their vastly expanded psychic power. Beyond the mere act of reading the minds of others, projecting their thoughts psionically, manipulating the perceptions of reality and assuming control of another person’s actions as well as their thoughts.{{citation}} The union of the psyche also increases their comprehensive ability, tactical understanding, acumen quota and comprehensive understanding well beyond the regular norm for each of the girls.{{citation}}
*** '''Hive Intelligence:''' The intelligence of the Cuckoo's gradually increases when they are in the close proximity of one another, mainly when they are in the presence of another Cuckoo. Statistically speaking, the more individuals of their collative whole are in psychic reach of each other in the group, the smarter the shared consciousness becomes over time.{{citation}}
'''Telekinesis:''' At least a few amongst the Cuckoos possess psychokinesis of an undefined degree. For instance, Phoebe once psychically lifted a bowl of cereal over a young Bobby's head.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 30}}<br>
'''Flawless Organic Diamond Form:''' Like their biological mother, the Cuckoos have the ability to transform themselves into a flexible, translucent, organic diamond-like substance while retaining mobility. In this form, their skin is as hard as real diamond. In this state, food and water are not needed for a undetermined amount of time. Their diamond form does not require a conscious hold and thus will remain until it is voluntarily triggered back. Unlike Emma Frost, their diamond forms are completely flawless. Nothing can enter or escape from their core. However, maintaining this form for extended period of time reduces their emotional capabilities.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #4}}-[[X-Men Phoenix Warsong #5|5]]}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}}
* '''''Psionic Immunity:''' Although they are immune to all psychic powers, they can not use their Telepathy.
* '''''Superhuman Strength:''' In Diamond Form they lift 85 tons.
* '''''Superhuman Stamina''''': Their diamond form grants the ability to sustain peak exertion for up to a day. 
* '''''Superhuman Durability''''': Their diamond form augments their skin, bone, and muscle to become stronger and harder than human. They're completely impervious in their diamond form.
* '''''Compartmental Diamond Transformation''''': Unlike Emma, the Cuckoos can selectively transform discrete parts of their bodies. Once, to trap the Phoenix Force fragments, the girls transformed their hearts into a flawless diamond prison.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #5}}

==Personalities==
The personalities of the five girls are often quite similar in terms of speaking and action. Though the girls do have their occasional arguments from time to time, they all more or less act the same and do things together. On the flip side each Cuckoo has demonstrated a different interest and/or personality trait when they are not all together, e.g. one being kinder then the others, one being more timid or tough and outspoken.

===[[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]]=== 
Sophie was initially the dominant personality among her sisters.{{r|New X-Men #134}} She and her sisters have mentioned that Sophie always had a desire to be a hero.{{r|New X-Men #137}}{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #1}} Her actions certainly appear the most noble.{{r|New X-Men #134|137}}{{r|Chaos War: X-Men #1|2}}

===[[Phoebe Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Phoebe]]===
Phoebe has demonstrated some aggressive behavior, especially when the Phoenix came to possess the Stepford sisters. Phoebe desired to embrace the Phoenix and all its destructive power. Phoebe has often acted as the de facto leader since the death of Sophie.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #1}}-[[X-Men Phoenix Warsong #5|5]]}} Phoebe was one of the few mutants unaffected by [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Zero]]'s mental control when he turned Utopia against [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]], which put her at odds with her sisters.{{r|Generation Hope #13}}{{r|Generation Hope #16|17}} After Cyclops and Wolverine decided to part ways, Phoebe wanted to return to [[Westchester County|Westchester]].{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}}

===[[Irma Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Irma Mindee]]=== 
Irma/Mindee enjoys playing piano.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 157}} She was certainly the most consigned to their fate as tools of [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Sublime]].{{r|{{cl|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #1}}-[[X-Men Phoenix Warsong #5|5]]}} During [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Osborn]]'s [[Utopia (Event)|assault on the X-Men]], Cyclops assigned Irma to be captured.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #514}} Acting as a Trojan horse, through her link with her sisters Irma was able to lead the X-Men to [[Alcatraz Island]], where Osborn had secretly been imprisoning mutants.{{r|Dark Avengers #8}} After Cyclops and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] decided to part ways, Mindee wanted to remain on Utopia.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}}

===[[Celeste Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Celeste]]===
Celeste was initially the most timid and affectionate of the Cuckoos. When the Phoenix came to possess the Stepford sisters, Celeste was reluctant to use the power. However, it was Celeste honed the Phoenix Force into destroying their incubated sisters and trapping the Phoenix fragments in their diamond hearts.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #1}}-[[X-Men Phoenix Warsong #5|5]]}} According to her sisters, Celeste has began to think she's "better" than them.{{r|Nation X #4}} Celeste has urged her sisters to watch something a bit more self-improving than ''Glee''.{{r|Generation Hope #9}} Celeste was the deciding vote to remain on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]].{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}} When Emma Frost and the [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|Extinction Team]] became outlaws, Celeste telepathically reached out to Emma and when she couldn't contact her, she became extremely angry.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 5}}

===[[Esme Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Esme]]===
Esme was the most conniving and cunning of her sisters. To gain control over her sisters, Esme began using [[Hypercortisone D|Kick]] and working with [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorneto]]. She covertly influenced Sophie into overdosing on Kick.{{r|New X-Men #137}}{{r|New X-Men #141}} She later shot [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]{{r|New X-Men #139|141}} then ran away to join Xorn's new [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood]].{{r|New X-Men #146|150}}

| Notes                   = * The Stepford Cuckoos first appeared in {{cl|New X-Men #118}}. However, they were not identified by name until they are collectively called "the Stepford Cuckoos" in {{cl|New X-Men #123}}. Esme was also named during this issue. Sophie, Phoebe, Celeste, and Mindee were later named in {{cl|New X-Men #134}}, {{cl|New X-Men #149}}, {{cl|New X-Men #153}}, and {{cl|New X-Men #156}} respectively. In {{cl|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}, their last name was confirmed as "Cuckoo". Originally the girls chose the codename the [[Five-In-One]], but with the deaths of Sophie and Esme the remaining sisters are now known as the "[[Three-In-One]]".
** Later [[Matt Fraction]] [[Glossary:Retcon|retconned]] Mindee's name to actually be Irma to comply with creator [[Grant Morrison]]'s original desire for first letters the quintuplet's first names to spell "SPICE", hence Sophie, Phoebe, Irma (or Mindee), Celeste, and Esme.
* In {{cl|New X-Men #154}}, creator [[Grant Morrison]]'s final issue of New X-Men, the Stepford Cuckoos are identified as [[Weapon XIV]]. However, their link to the [[Weapon Plus]] program is finally explored in the {{cl|X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1|Phoenix Warsong miniseries}}.
* The power level of the Cuckoos, in all of their incarnations, has been reported by many of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] (including [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]], [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], and [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]]) to be extremely impressive and strong.

| Trivia                  = 
* The name "The [[Stepford Cuckoos]]" is derived from a combination of "''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepford_Wives The Stepford Wives]''" and "''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midwich_Cuckoos The Midwich Cuckoos]''", two psychological, science-fiction thrillers.
** During the {{cl|X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1|Phoenix Warsong miniseries}}, the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] implies the girls' surname, Cuckoo, is actually a clever code. The cuckoo bird lays its eggs in another bird's nest, who then tends to the eggs until they hatch. This refers to [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Sublime]] placing his [[Weapon XIV]], the Stepford Cuckoos, in the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]'s nest, the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Institute]], to be trained. 
* The Stepford Cuckoos have had very bad luck with their boyfriends. Additionally, whenever one of the Stepford Cuckoos has become involved in a romantic relationship, her sisters have usually expressed strong disapproval.
** [[Esme Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Esme]]'s boyfriend [[Stuff (Earth-616)|Kato]], who appeared to be a [[Japan]]ese mutant, turned out to actually be a sponge-like alien, and an advance scout of the [[Shi'ar]] Super-guardian Team.{{r|New X-Men #123}}
** [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]] had a crush on [[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]], which she did not reciprocate. This crush partial inspired the events that lead to the riot at Xaviers, and indirectly to Sophie's death.{{r|New X-Men #134|137}}
** It is implied that Esme had a romantic physical relationship with [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorneto]].{{r|New X-Men #146|150}}
** [[Irma Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Mindee]]'s first boyfriend, [[Germaine Caruso (Earth-616)|Germaine]], died during an anti-mutant riot while the students were temporarily housed in an [[X-Corporation (Earth-616)|X-Corp building]] in [[Salem Center]].{{r|New X-Men #155|156}}
** Mindee later had a brief yet combative flirtation with [[Joshua Guthrie (Earth-616)|Jay Guthrie]], who repeatedly interrupted her while she was practicing the piano.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #159}} Although the relationship did not progress, Jay died a rather gruesome death at the hands of [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] and [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Rev. William Stryker]].
** The girls have intermittently shown a romantic interest in [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]]. Phoebe, Celeste, and Mindee all attended a school dance with Hellion, who quickly abandoned them in favor of [[Sofia Mantega (Earth-616)|Wind Dancer]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 14}} Later, the other girls briefly teased Celeste for having a crush on Hellion.{{r|Nation X #2}}
** Celeste briefly had a crush on [[Jacob Oh (Earth-616)|Agent Jake Oh]],{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #2}} who was present when she murdered her incubated sisters and lost her emotional ability to feel.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #5}}
* The Cuckoos were voted "''Teacher's Pet''" in the {{cl|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}. It also lists their likes as classical music, and dislikes as unreasonable expectations.{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}
* The Cuckoos are almost always seen wearing matching outfits with their hair styled similarly. There are very few exceptions to this habit.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}}{{r|X-Force Vol 3 20}}{{r|{{cl|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #1}}-[[X-Men Phoenix Warsong #5|5]]}}{{r|Generation Hope #16}} 
* Although the Cuckoos are biologically in their mid-to-late teens, chronologically they are only a few years old.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #494}}
* Although the Stepford Cuckoos can transform into their diamond form at will, they rarely use this power.
* While [[Phoebe Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Phoebe]] and [[Irma Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Mindee]] enjoy ''Glee'', [[Celeste Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Celeste]] appears to find the show vapid and shallow.{{r|Generation Hope #9}} 
* While it was initially assumed that they are all currently dating the teenage version of [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]]{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 3}}{{r|Cable Vol 4 2}}, this was proven false when it was revealed that Phoebe Cuckoo is secretly dating Quentin Quire in secret.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 11}}
