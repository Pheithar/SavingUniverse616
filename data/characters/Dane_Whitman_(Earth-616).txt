| History                 = As a young man, Dane Whitman fell in love with [[Ashima Chopra (Earth-616)|Ashima Chopra]], who developed terminal cancer. Dane planned to visit her in the hospital and propose, but lost his nerve and fell out of touch. Refusing treatment, Ashima died within a year, after secretly giving birth to a baby girl, [[Jackie Chopra (Earth-616)|Jackie]].{{r|Black Knight: Curse of the Ebony Blade Vol 1 5}}

[[File:Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 52.jpg|thumb|left]]
As an adult, Dane inherited his uncle [[Nathan Garrett (Earth-616)|Nathan Garrett]]'s [[Garrett Castle (England)|castle]]. He was unaware that his uncle had been the villainous Black Knight until finding notes and inventions.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 48}} Eventually he came upon the [[Ebony Blade]]. Passing its test, [[Percival of Scandia (Earth-616)|Sir Percival]] explained the history of the blade and its curse. Taking the weapon Dane decided to be a hero, joining the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] just as his uncle did, but with the intent of infiltrating them from within. This he did to aid the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], but they did not trust him until he later assisted them against [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]].{{Citation}}

===Crusades===
Dane later fought alongside the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] against the [[Amora (Earth-616)|Enchantress]], but was apparently turned to stone by her. The [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] took possession of the Knight's Ebony Blade and his winged horse, [[Aragorn (Earth-616)|Aragorn]], and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]] took custody of his petrified form.{{r|Defenders #4}} The Defenders later attempted to restore him using the [[Evil Eye]] of [[Avalon (Otherworld)|Avalon]]. They discovered, however, that Whitman's spirit had been transported back in time to the 12th Century where it now inhabited the body of his own ancestor, [[Eobar Garrington (Earth-616)|Eobar Garrington]]. Whitman declined to return to the present day with the Defenders, and Valkyrie returned his sword to him; Whitman allowed her to keep the horse.{{r|Defenders #11}} Later, however, he was equipped with a new flying horse named [[Valinor (Earth-616)|Valinor]] and transported (still in Garrington's body) to the present day by the mage [[Merlyn (Otherworld)|Merlyn]], to carry out a special mission. Sent to find the amnesiac hero [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]], Whitman then traveled with him to [[Otherworld]] to battle the evil [[Mordred (Earth-616)|Mordred]] and his master, the demonic [[Necromon (Earth-616)|Necromon]], and save [[Camelot]] (at some point during the course of this quest, both heroes were briefly abducted by the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] to participate in his 'Contest of Champions'). After this mission was concluded, Whitman was returned to the 12th Century, though he did briefly travel forward again to attend Merlyn's funeral. Back in the past, he protected the mystical island of Avalon from the demonic [[Fomorians|Fomor]], until Garrington's body was eventually destroyed during a battle involving the time-traveling Avengers. Whitman's spirit returned to his original body, which became flesh and blood again.

===Avengers===
Dane served several tours of duty with the Avengers. While a member, his scientific knowledge came to be useful, especially when such minds as [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]] were not on the roster. He began his first extended membership with the team shortly after [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] stepped down as chairperson.{{r|Avengers #255}} Dane participated in the siege on [[Avengers Mansion]] by the Masters of Evil (during which he was captured and beaten by [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mister Hyde]]). Despite his injuries, Dane remained with the team after the membership shakeup that followed.{{r|Avengers #273|278}}

The curse of the Ebony Blade reasserted itself after the Avengers' associate member [[Marrina Smallwood (Earth-616)|Marrina]] went insane and became the enormous Leviathan. Her husband [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] used the Ebony Blade to slay Marrina, reactivating the Knight's curse. Dane began to physically transform into an extension of the blade, his body seizing up until he required an exoskeleton to move it.{{r|Avengers #294|297}} After the Avengers disbanded, the Black Knight joined Thor in defense of [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]] from the invasion of the Egyptian Death God known as [[Seth (Earth-616)|Seth]], but his curse finally took hold and the Knight was trapped as an inanimate statue once again.{{r|Thor #396|400}}

Returned to his ancestral castle, Dane's statue was tended to by [[Victoria Bentley (Earth-616)|Victoria Bentley]]. She attempted a spell to restore him to life, but inadvertently summoned the spirit of the original Black Knight, Sir Percy of Scandia, in his place. After a series of adventures, Sir Percy abdicated Dane's body, taking the Ebony Blade's curse with him and restoring Whitman to his own body. Sir Percy had taken a squire named [[Sean Dolan (Earth-616)|Sean Dolan]], who Dane kept as his own.{{r|{{cl|Black Knight Vol 2 1}}-[[Black Knight Vol 2 4|4]]}}
 
The Black Knight returned to the Avengers after this, first as a reserve substitute,{{r|Avengers #329}} and later as a full member.{{r|Avengers #343}} The curse of the Ebony Blade became too dangerous, and Dane eventually abandoned it choosing to use a [[Photon Sword|technological weapon]] instead.{{r|Avengers #343}} He was involved in [[Operation Galactic Storm]], during which he was part of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]'s team, sent to the [[Kree Empire]]. At the end of that mission, Dane was among the Avengers who followed Iron Man to execute the [[Kree]] [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]], and was, in fact, the one who struck the mortal blow.{{r|Avengers #345|348}}

[[File:Avengers Vol 1 357 Textless Remastered.jpg|thumb|left|180px|With the Avengers]]
While Dane would be away with the Avengers, Victoria Bentley retained ownership of the castle so he would not lose it. She could easily watch over the property as it neighbored hers. However, Dane's former squire became possessed by the Ebony Blade and turned into the Bloodwraith.{{r|Avengers Annual #22}} The Bloodwraith accidentally killed Victoria during a duel between the Bloodwraith, Dane, and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]].{{r|Avengers #366}}

At this time, Dane also found himself in a love triangle with [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]] and [[Sersi (Earth-616)|Sersi]]. At first, he pursued a relationship with Sersi, as Crystal and her estranged husband, [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Pietro]], attempted to reconcile, even becoming Sersi's "[[Gann Josin]]", establishing a powerful psychic link which was meant to help Sersi maintain control in troubled times. Still, after Crystal and Pietro relationship seemingly reached the point of no return, he confessed his feelings for Crystal and the two kissed. However, [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna]]'s kidnapping brought Pietro and Crystal closer again, so, after [[Dane Whitman (Earth-374)|Proctor]] (an evil alternate version of Dane) was finally defeated, Sersi felt she was too dangerous and had to exile herself, and Dane went along with her, leaving Crystal behind.{{r|Avengers #355|375}}

===Ultraverse===
The two eventually ended up in the [[Earth-93060|Ultraverse]]. Dane became a member of the local heroes known as [[UltraForce (Earth-93060)|UltraForce]].{{r|UltraForce #8|10}} During a reality-shredding event known as [[Black September]], the Avengers and UltraForce joined forces against [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] and the combined sentient power of the [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Gems]]. In the aftermath, Dane remained in the Ultraverse as the new leader of UltraForce.{{r|Avengers/UltraForce #1}}

After leading UltraForce for several months, Dane had the opportunity to return to [[Earth-616]] after an alien invasion. He took the chance and passed through a portal leading back home.{{r|Ultraverse Unlimited #2}}

While Dane was in the body of his ancestor Eobar Garrington during the Crusades, he met the knight [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Bennet du Paris]], who became Exodus shortly after.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 11}}{{r|Black Knight: Exodus Vol 1 1}} This explained why Dane felt Exodus was somehow familiar when they 'first' met in [[Genosha]] sometime earlier.{{r|Bloodties}}

===Heroes for Hire===
Sersi was later able to transport herself and Dane back to the present. Their 'Gann Josin' had apparently been broken and they had gone their separate ways aside from acting as reservist Avengers. Dane joined [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]]'s [[Heroes for Hire (Oracle Inc.) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]] shortly after his return.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 1 2}}

Not long after his return to Earth, the [[Niamh Chinn Óir (Earth-616)|Lady of the Lake]] appeared to Dane, telling him he was destined to become Avalon's champion. She presented him with a new armor as well as the [[Shield of Night]] and the [[Sword of Light]].{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 1 2}} While working with Heroes for Hire Dane came across the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]]'s [[Knights of Wundagore (Earth-616)|Knights of Wundagore]] and agreed to train them. It was at this time that Dane acquired one of their "atomic steeds."{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 1 15|17}}

===Excalibur and Avengers===
Dane briefly joined an [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] team who helped [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]] to become the new monarch of [[Otherworld]].{{r|{{cl|Excalibur Vol 2 1}}-[[Excalibur Vol 2 4|4]]}} For a time he served sporadically as a member of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]{{r|Avengers Vol 3 #40|44}}{{r|Avengers Vol 3 #52|55}} and was present when they disbanded.{{r|Avengers #501|502}}

Later, Dane had returned to [[Garrett Castle (England)|Garrett Castle]] and converted it into a museum. Dane suddenly switched bodies with the original Black Knight, Sir Percy of Scandia. The investigating new Excalibur team found an ancient scroll in Percival's tomb showing the team as the saviors of Camelot. Traveling back to the era of [[Arthur Pendragon (Earth-616)|King Arthur]], Whitman met Percy and helped his ancestor, King Arthur, and Merlin defeat the dragons plaguing the kingdom (revealing the "dragons" to be [[Makluans]] in the process) and returned to the present. After assisting Excalibur in tracking down [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] in [[Korea]] and returning him to the team, Whitman left in search of his real Ebony Blade.{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 10|15}}

===Captain Britain and MI-13===
Recently returned to [[England]], Whitman appeared to be wielding the original Blade again (actually a fake created by [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]]), using it to slaughter invading [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] during the [[Secret Invasion]]. Dane also was revealed to have a literal stone heart, given to him by Sersi to keep him "above it all" and uninvolved.{{r|Captain Britain and MI-13 Vol 1 #10}} During the invasion, Dane made his way through [[London (England)|London]] protecting innocents and in doing so saved the life of civilian doctor [[Faiza Hussain (Earth-616)|Faiza Hussain]]. Faiza fought alongside Dane against the Skrull army and their champion, [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]], until Dane was incapacitated and a newly resurrected [[Captain Britain (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]] came to their rescue. While Captain Britain fought Super-Skrull, Faiza attempted to heal a dying Black Knight with her newfound abilities, and Dane - under the belief that he was on his deathbed - dubbed her his steward. Captain Britain was able to defeat the Super Skrull, Faiza healed Dane once magic returned to England and the Skrull Invasion in England came to an end; but not without revealing the new wielder of [[Excalibur (Sword)|Excalibur]] to be Faiza.{{r|Captain Britain and MI-13 Vol 1 1|4}}

[[File:Dane Whitman (Earth-616) from Captain Britain and MI-13 Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Killing a Skrull]]

===Insanity and Euroforce===
He slowly started to become insane because of the power of the Ebony Blade. After encountering a fake [[James Zafar (Earth-616)|Savage Steel]] robbing a bank, he brutally beat the criminal, even costing him an eye and leaving him in a coma. After the [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Watcher]]'s [[Original Sin (Event)|death and the release of the secrets buried in his eye]], his attack on Savage Steel was revealed to [[Rebecca Stevens (Earth-616)|Rebecca Stevens]], a historian investigating the Blade who he previously met. She told him that the past users of the Blade had all fallen insane and offered help, but he refused.{{r|Original Sins #2}} Later, he was recruited to lead the new [[Euroforce (Earth-616)|Euroforce]] as a "temporal adjustment".{{r|Avengers World #8}}

===Journey on Weirdworld===
Black Knight had fled to [[Weirdworld (Battleworld)|Weirdworld]] after killing [[Andreas Zorba (Earth-616)|Carnivore]] when losing control over the Ebony Blade as it increased in power.{{r|Black Knight Vol 3 2}} There, he murdered [[Zaltin Tar (Earth-616)|King Zaltin Tar]] to establish [[New Avalon (Battleworld's Weirdworld)|New Avalon]] and built an army of Amazons, Demon Dogs, Giants, Ice Swarms, Thunder & Lightning Dragons, [[Tribbitites]], and Underwater Apes with the help of [[Bolten Dinn (Earth-616)|Shield]] and [[Alkyra Thash (Earth-616)|Spear]]. The army was formed in anticipation of the arrival of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]] seeking to bring him to justice.{{r|Black Knight Vol 3 1}} When the Avengers Unity Division arrived, they encountered Black Knight and his army, ultimately separating him from the Ebony Blade, so that he could be apprehended.{{r|Black Knight Vol 3 3}} Later, commander Steve Rogers realized that the people of New Avalon relied upon Dane Whitman, and after defending the kingdom from the [[Fangs of the Serpent (Earth-616)|Fangs of the Serpent]], Rebecca Stevens negotiated a compromise whereby Dane would remain in Weirdworld with her.{{r|Black Knight Vol 3 #4|5}}

===Worldwide Conflicts===
When Captain America established a [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] Empire in the [[United States of America]], Hydra splinter groups started to form all over the world and several superhero teams were gathered to stop Hydra from going any further.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 18}}

Meanwhile, Dane Whitman returned to [[Europe]] to help Euroforce battle Hydra, but he was apprehended alongside several teammates, remaining imprisoned until the [[Champions of Europe (Earth-616)|Champions of Europe]] arrived and freed them.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 9}} On another occasion, Dane answered the call to join the Avengers battling the threat of the [[Empyre (Earth-616)|Empyre]] led [[Cotati]].{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Dane Whitman (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 8 43 001.jpg|thumb|left|As the Phoenix Knight]]

===Enter the Phoenix===
When the cosmic force known as the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] returned to Earth, it staged a contest to determine its next host, and Black Knight was one of many individuals summoned to the [[White Hot Room]] for it. The Phoenix empowered the assembled champions and had them fight each other in trials by combat.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 40}} Dubbing himself the Phoenix Knight, Dane was pitted against the mysterious [[Red Widow (Winter Guard) (Earth-616)|Red Widow]] in [[Stonehenge]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 41}} However, Black Knight was quickly overpowered by his opponent and was defeated.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 43}}

===King in Black and Curse of the Ebony Blade===
Depressed and resentful that the Avengers viewed him as a madman, Dane doubled down on his conviction that the Ebony Blade was responsible for his fits of rage. When the dark god [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] assailed the Earth with his [[Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)|horde of symbiotes]], Dane was among the Avengers-adjacent heroes contacted. En route to Manhattan he was attacked by a [[Symbiote Dragons|symbiote-dragon]] sent by Knull to claim the Ebony Blade, crashlanding in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]. Losing his grip on the Ebony Blade, Dane encountering [[Lei Ling (Earth-616)|Aero]] and [[Lin Lie (Earth-616)|Swordmaster]] while searching for it, and was angered by their disdain towards him. When Swordmaster refused to help save the civilians after learning the symbiotes were not minions of his nemesis, the dark god [[Chiyou (Earth-616)|Chiyou]], his divine weapon - the [[Sword of Fu Xi]] - foresook him for Dane.<!--{{r|King in Black: Black Knight Vol 1 1}}-->

Lapsing into a berserk state, Dane hacked a symbiote dragon to shreds, maniacally declaring that the Sword of Fu Xi belonged to him now. As Swordmaster tried to take the divine sword back, one of the symbiotes latched onto them and connected them psychically to Knull, who revealed to Dane the truth of the Ebony Blade - that the sword's curse was not responsible for his family's history of mental instability and bloodlust, but it fed off their inner darkness and could only be wielded by a person consumed by evil. Knull declared his intent to claim both the Ebony Blade and the Sword of Fu Xi for himself, manifesting an avatar in the shape of Chiyou to mock Swordmaster. The Sword of Fu Xi rejected Dane as its wielder and returned to Swordmaster, leaving Dane devastated to learn his whole life had been a lie. Sensing his despair, the Ebony Blade returned to him, and Dane ultimately decided to channel his inner darkness to put a stop to Knull's invasion.{{r|King in Black: Black Knight Vol 1 1}}

At some point around this time, Dane learned about the existence of his daugter, Jacks. Deciding to approach the relationship slowly to "soften the blow", Danre reached out to her academically to discuss her thesis in Arthurian mythology. Mordred, seeking to claim the Ebony items for himself, killed Dane and tried to take the sword before being chased away by the Avengers, and Dane was later resurrected by the Ebony Blade. While Dane confronted Percy for the truth of the Ebony Blade, [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]] attacked him - having been tracking Mordred to obtain a Bloodstone in his possession. Dane, Elsa, and Jacks tracked down the missing [[Ebony Chalice]] to the mystical realm of [[Listeneise]], repelling Mordred when he attempted to claim the goblet and sword. Drinking from the Chalice, Dane learned that Merlin had masterminded the downfall of Camelot, manipulating Arthur and Mordred, and had Percy assassinated in hopes of covering up Camelot's dark secret with the sanitized narratives that became Arthurian lore. Informed of Mordred's plan to forge the Ebony Shield, Ebony Dagger, and Ebony Chalice into an [[Ebony Crown]], Dane cast aside the Ebony Blade and let Mordred fatally wound him. When Jacks took up the Ebony Blade, her connection to Dane was revealed and she used her rage to kill Mordred. Resurrected by the Ebony Crown, Dane reforged it into the [[Ebon Siege]] - which gave dark portents to those who sat in it. Expecting Jacks to reject him as her father, Dane was shocked when she instead offered to lessen the burden of the Ebony Blade's curse by sharing the moniker of the Black Knight with him.{{r|{{cl|Black Knight: Curse of the Ebony Blade Vol 1 1}}-[[Black Knight: Curse of the Ebony Blade Vol 1 5|5]]}}
