===Early Years===
James Proudstar was born on the Apache reservation in [[Camp Verde]], [[Arizona (State)|Arizona]]. As a young boy, James idolized his older brother, [[John Proudstar (Earth-616)|John Proudstar]], and when John returned from a stint in the Marines, James was overjoyed to see him again. Unfortunately, their [[Maria Proudstar (Earth-616)|mother]] revealed to the family that she had cancer, prompting a visit to an amusement park, where James had his fortune told to him by none other than [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny]], though James thought she was a fraud. Then, James secretly accompanied John, when he infiltrated Arroyo labs, the clinic that was running tests on their reservation's people and treating them for cancer. James was discovered by [[Edwin Martynec (Earth-616)|Dr. Edwin Martynec]], who revealed himself to be a mutated werewolf. The brothers learned that Dr. Martynec was faking the cancer diagnoses, so he could irradiate his patients and observe the results.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 -1}}

John was soon recruited to the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and was killed on one of the team's first missions.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 95}} James blamed the X-Men for his brother's death and promised to murder its founder, [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]].{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 3}}

===Hellions===
James soon manifested his own [[Homo superior|mutation]], similar to his brothers'. He joined the [[Hellions (Earth-616)|Hellions]], at the [[Massachusetts Academy]], under the leadership of [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|The White Queen]], where he was tutored and trained by her in the use of his powers.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 16|17}}

[[File:James Proudstar (Earth-616) from New Mutants Vol 1 16 001.jpg|180px|thumb|left]]
James first encountered the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] after the White Queen invited [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Doug Ramsey]] to her school and captured [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] and Doug. [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] was unaware that Kitty and [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] shared a rapport and the New Mutants came to their rescue. Still, they were all captured and forced to remain at the Academy. With the growing rivalry between the two teams and the New Mutant's reluctance to accept their fate, the Hellions proposed a challenge and, if the New Mutants won, they would allow them to escape. During the match, however, the White Queen appeared and chaos ensued, nonetheless allowing the New Mutants to escape.{{r|{{cl|New Mutants Vol 1 15}}-[[New Mutants Vol 1 17|17]]}}

James later donned his brother's costume and kidnapped the X-Man [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], to draw the team to [[Cheyenne Mountain]], where his brother John had been killed. Everything was going just as planned for him, but at the last second, James couldn't bring himself to kill Professor X. Professor X, eventually, convinced Thunderbird that his brother died a hero's death and James released them, stating Professor Xavier was an honorable man. Professor X offered James membership into the New Mutants, but he declined. Instead, James rejoined the Hellions and eventually became the leader.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 193}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 53}}

Once, [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] was invited to attend a [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] event and decided to bring the New Mutants as well. That night, James and [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Dani]] got along quite well and seemed to think highly of each other, despite their differences. However, the event turned sour for the young mutants after finding [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]] drunk in a bed with [[Jennifer Stavros (Earth-616)|Roulette]], leading [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]] to suggest another contest between the two teams. The contest was for both teams to hunt down the person responsible for selling a member of the Hellfire Club a forged statue of [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]] and the losers were to apologize, publicly, for any insults and take the rap for any trouble with their teachers before sunrise. After having [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Illyana Rasputin]] spy on the Hellions through a scrying glass in [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]], the New Mutants learned that [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]] and the [[Keniuchio Harada (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]] were behind the forgery and decided to intercept the villains, before the Hellions. Unknown to the New Mutants, Thunderbird assumed that they would spy on the Hellions and led them to the henchmen of the villains, while the Hellions captured Viper and Silver Samurai, winning the competition. Upon returning to the [[Hellfire Club Building (New York)|Hellfire Club]], James and Dani settle their differences and were about to kiss when [[Sage (Earth-616)|Tessa]] arrived with a letter from [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Xi'an Coy Manh]], for Dani.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 53|54}} After hearing of an animal creature that was being mistreated after capture, Emma allowed the Hellions to participate in a contest with the New Mutants to abduct [[Bird-Brain (Earth-616)|Bird Brain]], where Thunderbird was influenced, by [[Manuel de la Rocha (Earth-616)|Empath]], to admit his crush on Dani, and the New Mutants emerged victorious.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 56}}

===X-Force===
James soon felt like he did not fit in with the Hellions and quit, returning to the Apache reservation in Camp Verde, Arizona. [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] soon met with James and offered him membership into his New Mutants, but he declined, as he enjoyed staying at the reservation. When James returned, he found the entire tribe murdered, and a Hellfire Club agent's mask left behind. James then decided to join the New Mutants from his newly formed vendetta against the Hellfire Club and Emma in particular.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 99}}

Under Cable's leadership, the New Mutants no longer associated with the X-Men and James took on the codename Warpath. Alongside X-Force, he fought the [[Mutant Liberation Front (Earth-616)|M.L.F.]], the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] led by [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]], and many other villains that crossed their path. When James later met Emma again, she claimed she had no ties to the killings of his tribe.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 42}}

When Cable moved X-Force back to the X-Mansion, he tried to get Warpath to train with a bo staff, which he did for a short time, but never used in action. By this time, Warpath experienced an increase in sensory awareness and strength that allowed him to perform feats he never imagined before, such as run at 100 MPH and climb walls by digging his fingers into the concrete. One night, he received a message regarding the massacre's perpetrators and ran to New York, where [[Gloria Muñoz (Earth-616)|Risque]] introduced herself to him from the shadows, planted a kiss on his lips, and left.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 51}}

Then, when [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]] made her move against the [[Externals (Earth-616)|X-Ternals]], killing those who remained, Warpath sensed her presence in [[Gideon (Earth-616)|Gideon]]'s apartment and climbed the building to find it. He was able to track Selene, but fell victim to her spells and was knocked out. Fortunately, Risque arrived and pulled James out before Selene could drain his life. Risque took James to [[Florida (State)|Florida]] to recuperate and they fell for each other. Eventually James wanted to get back to his friends, and the duo arrived just in time to defend [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] from [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]]. Warpath intended to remain at the Mansion, but after being confronted by the [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]] and [[Calvin Rankin (Earth-616)|Mimic]] in [[New York City]], Risque finally fulfilled her "mission" by slipping a sleeping pill into Jimmy's drink and brought him to [[Sledge (Earth-616)|Sledge]] in [[Detroit]].{{r|X-Force Vol 1 65}}

[[File:X-Force Vol 1 82 Textless.jpg|180px|thumb|left]]
Sledge had no malicious intent, but rather offered James the location of his tribesman [[Michael Whitecloud (Earth-616)|Michael Whitecloud]], who had somehow survived the massacre on the reservation. In return, he asked Warpath to enter a dimensional gateway and retrieve the person who was trapped there. That person ended up being the [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]], and James rocketed him out of the dimension with his vacuum suit's jetpack. As a result of this experience (in which he almost ended up trapped forever telling stories to the dimension's natives), James began to question his constant searching for vengeance and his focus on the past. James got Whitecloud's location from Sledge and went to see him with [[Theresa Rourke (Earth-616)|Siryn]]. Whitecloud told Warpath more information about the massacre and how he escaped as well as how to access the files he stole from the Arroyo Institute, which was the reason for the destruction of Camp Verde. However, Whitecloud's head exploded before he could reveal the names of those who sponsored the massacre. James retrieved the documents, but was ambushed and captured by Martin Edwards ([[Edwin Martynec (Earth-616)|Edwin Martynec]]), who was waiting for him. Martynec revealed that he had been working for [[Nathan Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]] to create mutated soldiers and experimented on the people at Camp Verde, but the escape of one of his doctors and one of his creations necessitated the massacre as a cover up. Siryn and Warpath broke free but Martynec injected James with a drug and killed him.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 73}}

In a hell dimension, Warpath was confronted by Stryfe, who wanted to force him into despair, which would allow Stryfe to be resurrected by [[Blackheart (Earth-616)|Blackheart]]. Fortunately, Jimmy was able to connect with Siryn, who was doing CPR on him. Also, [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie (Brunnhilde)]] brought the rest of X-Force to the hell dimension to fight for Jimmy's soul, and they won, returning Jimmy to life.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 74}}

Under [[Peter Wisdom (Earth-616)|Pete Wisdom's]] tutelage, James learned how to use his enhanced abilities to do things he never thought of, like fly. Exactly how he manipulated his power to do this is still unknown. James remained with X-Force through Wisdom's tenure and through one faking of the team's death. However, when X-Force came upon a top-secret plot to use alien technology to recreate a planet-moving engine, they apparently could not stop the bio-engineered defenders of the facility. James and his teammates (except Domino) were presumed dead following the explosion they set off, levelling the alien tech base. However, they soon appeared at a press conference for the new team calling itself [[X-Statix (Earth-616)|X-Force]], and got into a fight with the other mutants over naming rights.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 117}}

===X-Corporation===
Shortly thereafter, James was recruited by the [[Mumbai]], [[India]] office of the [[X-Corporation (Earth-616)|X-Corporation]]. When Professor X came to visit, James saved his life from assassination by the deranged [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Lilandra]]. He worked with former teammate [[Maria Callasantos (Earth-616)|Feral]], her sister [[Lucia Callasantos (Earth-616)|Thornn]], and [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]]. Before receiving his X-Corporation uniform, he wore his brother's old costume, which the Indian public adored.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 133}}

===X-Men===
As a result of the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]'s actions during the "House of M" incident, nearly all of the mutants in the entire world were stripped of their powers, although James retained his powers. As a result of the loss of mutants, [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] shut down all of the X-Corporation offices and most of the X-Corporation employees were sent to the Xavier Institute. Warpath was one of the many as well as his former Hellion teammate, [[Manuel de la Rocha (Earth-616)|Empath]]. James did not enjoy his stay as it reminded him of a reservation he grew up in. While living on the Xavier grounds, James rekindled his friendship with former teammate [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]] who was also staying on the grounds. He also was given [[Warpath's Knives|Vibranium Knives]] as a gift from [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] and the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 475}}
[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 476 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Warpath as a member of the X-Men]] 

Shortly afterward, he was asked to accompany Professor X on a special mission. Along with Professor X, [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Marvel Girl]], [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], [[Armando Muñoz (Earth-616)|Darwin]], and [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], he journeyed into space to track down [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]]. Professor X told him that he chose him for this mission because no one among the X-Men had ever hated him the way Warpath previously had. He showed his superb fighting prowess while fighting cyborg drones as the X-Men attempted to commandeer a [[Shi'ar]] ship. During the final fight with Vulcan, Warpath fought bravely and in the end was on the spaceship with half of the team when Lilandra sent it back to Earth.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 475|486}}

Back on Earth, Warpath was training with [[Hepzibah (Earth-616)|Hepzibah]] when they came across [[Sentinels]] attacking a "trespasser", who turned out to be Caliban. Nightcrawler teleported Caliban away to the infirmary and Warpath threatened the Sentinel until Storm showed up putting the Sentinel pilot in an awkward situation.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 487}}

Caliban soon told them of Leech's kidnapping, and [[Masque (Earth-616)|Masque]]'s return. The X-Men journeyed to the [[Alley|Morlock Tunnels]], and Warpath fought an alligator along the way. Caliban explained that the alligators were their protectors and a girl could talk to them, but Warpath told him that she was gone and they were not listening anymore. While wrestling it, he was thrown through a wall, and on the other side found cryptic writings of [[Qwerty (Earth-616)|Qwerty]]. They soon found where [[Leech (Earth-616)|Leech]] was taken, and saved him while defeating renegade Morlocks in the process.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 487|491}}

===The New X-Force===
[[File:X-Force Vol 3 10 Textless.jpg|left|150px|thumb|As a member of the new X-Force]]
Warpath, along with Hepzibah, Caliban, [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]], [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]], and leader [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] formed a new [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] designed to personally do the extreme tasks the X-Men would not normally be associated with. During [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]], Caliban sacrificed his life to save James' by jumping in the path of a range of bullets from a [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reaver]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 45}}

James buried Caliban at his past Apache reservation, alongside his brother, and continued to fight alongside X-Force, as well as date Hepzibah. While taking some time off from X-Force, he visited his brothers' grave and was attacked by a disturbed [[Demon Bear (Earth-616)|Demon Bear]]. With the help of [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]], he learned the secrets of [[Eliphas (Earth-616)|Eli Bard]]; how he had resurrected his brother, Caliban, and his tribe as a sacrifice to Selene.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 11}}

===[[Necrosha]] And Afterwards===
After the [[Messiah War]], X-Force was thrust into the middle of [[Necrosha]], where reanimated mutants were controlled by Selene and the [[Techno-Organic Virus|T-O virus]]. He met Risque, who was a part of Selene's resurrected army, and she managed to fight the T-O virus long enough to tell him to get away. When he confronted his brother, he gave him a mercy killing. Later, with the help of an ancient ritual, he defeated Selene by stabbing her in the heart with her own dagger, which also freed the souls from her reanimated army.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 25}}
[[File:James Proudstar (Earth-616), Suvik Senyaka (Earth-616) and Selene Gallio (Earth-616) from X-Men Legacy Vol 1 231 001.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Brought before Selene]]

He later left the X-Force team, and was seen staying on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] afterward.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 25}} After the [[Schism (Event)|schism]] between Wolverine and Cyclops's factions, Jimmy remained on Utopia and became part of Storm and Psylocke's Security Recon Team for a time.{{r|X-Men Vol 3 20}} He joined the X-Men during the [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]]'s war on the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 28}}

===Weapon X===
While taking a break from both his family and the X-Men, Jimmy was captured by the resurfaced [[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X]] as part of the organization's process to refine their mutant-hunting cyborgs.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 2}} He was eventually rescued from containment by a team of mutants led by a time-displaced older version of [[James Howlett (Earth-21923)|Logan]] who all had been targeted by Weapon X.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 4}} Following the destruction of Weapon X, the team of mutants turned their alliance into a mutant-rescue squad, and started by taking back the name [[Weapon X-Force (Earth-616)|Weapon X]].{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 22}} Throughout Weapon X's subsequent adventures, Warpath developed a casual romantic relationship with [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]].{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 14}}
[[File:Weapon X Vol 3 14 Textless.jpg|left|180px|thumb|With Domino]]

To Warpath's disgruntlement, Logan stepped down due to his ailing health and ceded field leadership of the team to [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]], with whom James had butted heads repeatedly.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 17}} Not long after discovering that Sabretooth intended to return to his mercenary ways, with both [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]] and Domino supporting the idea,{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 18}} Warpath decided to quit the team. Sabretooth had joined forces with Weapon X's latest target, [[Arkady Rossovich (Earth-616)|Omega Red]], and intended to help him take down the Russian intelligence agency [[S.I.C.K.L.E. (Earth-616)|S.I.C.K.L.E.]], risking an international incident.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 19}}

Warpath intercepted his former teammates at the [[S.I.C.K.L.E. Mothercarrier]] and stood up against Sabretooth in an arduous fight before being forced to leave to assist Logan when the [[X-Men Blackbird|Blackbird]] started plummeting from the sky.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 21}}

===Krakoa===
Warpath was of the many mutants that joined the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] upon its creation. He was seen alongside many other Krakoans grieving Charles Xavier dead at the hands of anti-mutant super-human criminals that had infiltrated Krakoa and killed many of its residents, including Xavier.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 2}}

| Powers                  = Warpath is a mutant possessing various superhuman physical attributes, some of which have fluctuated considerably over the years.

After the powers of all the world's mutants were restored by the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]], Warpath's powers were enhanced slightly due to his training with Pete Wisdom and the realization he was limiting himself to the powers of his older brother.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 107}}

[[File:James Proudstar (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 475 0001.jpg|thumb|James Proudstar as Warpath]]
'''Superhuman Strength:''' Currently Warpath possesses some degree of superhuman strength, though the exact amount of weight he can lift isn't known. It has ranged over the years from Class 5 to Class 90 levels. As a teenager and member of the Hellions, Jimmy's strength level was roughly equivalent to his brother or Sunspot at the time, able to lift 2 tons.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 5}} He grew substantially in height, muscle mass, and strength as he got older. Cable once remarked that Warpath just kept getting "stronger and stronger".{{r|X-Force Vol 1 1}} In his early X-Force days, Warpath possessed Class 75 strength, with a Class 90 potential.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 33}}

It seems the activation and removal of the High Evolutionary's effect "rebooted" the genetic codes of mutant kind, allowing some of X-Force to access aspects of their mutation that were previously unknown to them. In Jimmy's case, it turned out that he had apparently been limiting himself to the abilities of his late brother but, under Wisdom’s training, his strength level apparently increased to some degree and he developed the power to fly under his own command. Warpath may have reached the previously mentioned Class 90 level at this point, or even beyond.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 106|109}}

In recent years, however, Warpath's strength level has presented as extraordinarily weaker than his X-Force days. He struggled while fighting a single sewer alligator{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 488}} and otherwise has consistently not demonstrated his previously Hulk-range strength.

'''Superhuman Speed:''' Despite his great size, Warpath is capable of running and moving at speeds much greater than even the finest human athlete. At his peak, Warpath is capable of running at speeds up to 100 miles per hour.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 51}} His current speed is unknown.

'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Warpath's physical stamina is such that he possesses greater physical stamina than any ordinary human and can exert himself at his peak for up to 24 hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood began to impair him.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 33}}

'''Invulnerability:''' Warpath's body is harder and more resistant to certain types of injury than the body of an ordinary human. For instance, he can withstand the force generated by great impacts. He can withstand impact forces, such as falling from several stories, being hit by certain level energy blasts, and being struck by a superhumanly strong opponent, that would severely injure or kill a normal human.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 33}}

'''Superhuman Agility:''' Warpath's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 33}}

'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Warpath's reflexes are similarly enhanced and are superior to those of the finest human athlete. He is even capable of evading gunfire.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 94}}

'''Superhumanly Acute Senses:''' Warpath's senses of sight and hearing are enhanced to levels beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human. This was first hinted at when Mimic mimicked enhanced senses from Warpath during a battle.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 46}} Jimmy soon began demonstrating enhanced senses himself. He is able to see, with perfect clarity, at much greater distances than an ordinary human. He retains this same level of clarity, even in near-total darkness. His hearing is similarly heightened, enabling him to both hear sounds that ordinary humans can't and sounds that they can detect but at much greater distances.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 51|53}}

'''Flight:''' Warpath is able to propel himself through the air without any aid. The exact limit of his flight speed is unknown, but it can exceed the speed of sound.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 20}} Like his peak strength level, Warpath first gained the power of flight while working with Pete Wisdom.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 106|109}}

'''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' James recently showed regenerative capability, the extent of which is currently unknown but seemingly he can heal minor injuries ranging from minor cuts, bruises and abrasions to more extreme physical trauma like internal rupturing, perforation and deep lacerations caused by incredibly dense substances like Adamantium-enhanced cyborg horses.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 2}}

'''Apache Shaman Abilities:''' Ghost Rider activated these abilities within James in order to help him fight the Demon Bear. He could perceive the creature's wounds and the resulting spirit energy when it was destroyed.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 10}} Through his Shamanism, he also devised a way of killing the unkillable mutant necromorphs raised by the Transmode Virus, while enabling the protection of the X-Force team from Selene's godlike state and soul hunger as well as end her in the same vein.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 25}}
