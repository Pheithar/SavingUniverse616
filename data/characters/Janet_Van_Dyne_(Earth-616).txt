| Overview =  '''Janet van Dyne''' is a fashion designer and socialite who is well known as the winsome '''[[Wasp]]'''. Following the death of [[Vernon Van Dyne (Earth-616)|her father]] at the hands of an [[Creatures (Kosmos)|extradimensional creature]], she was infused with [[Pym Particles]] and was biologically altered by his colleague scientist [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Dr. Hank Pym]], secretly the vigilante known as Ant-Man. As the Wasp, she became Pym's super-hero partner, having the ability to alter her size, fly at rapid speeds with [[Bio-Synthetic Wings|synthetic wings]] and fire energy stings.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} Alongside her partner, the Wasp is a founding member of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", being personally responsible to choose the name of the group.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 1}}

The Wasp eventually got married to Pym,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 60}} but their relationship would turn out to be a tragic experience as she became a victim of domestic violence.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 213}} She has weaponized the pain of her hurtful divorce by becoming one of the most prominent, efficient and empathetic Avengers' leaders.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 217}}{{r|Avengers Vol 3 27}} During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]], the Wasp had her powers tampered with to serve as a last suicide attack for the aliens. Her apparent death actually led to the end of the war, and Earth was protected through her sacrifice.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 8}} She was later found lost in [[Microverse]] by the original Avengers and returned to her super-heroic career.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 34}}

More recently, the Wasp has been part of multiple activities. She was part of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Unity Division]], an initiative aimed to integrate mutant and human super-heroes,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 5}} and became an [[Agents of Wakanda (Earth-616)|Agent of Wakanda]], working closely with the Avengers again.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 10}} Moreover, by acting as an inspiring mentor to [[Nadia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|the new Wasp]], her step-daughter, van Dyne has also assumed a motherly attitude.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 10}}

| History                 = 
===The Winsome Wasp===
'''Janet van Dyne''' was born into a wealthy family. Her family fortune was amassed by her uncle, textile magnate [[Blaine Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Blaine van Dyne]], and his wife, talented fashion designer [[Amelia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Amelia]].{{r|1939 Daily Bugle #1}} Janet's father was world-renowned scientist, [[Vernon Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Dr. Vernon van Dyne]]{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}, while her mother was a vibrant and creative woman who sustained an incapacitating brain injury in a car accident when Janet was a child. After years in a vegetative state for several years, she ultimately withered away and died.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 7}}
[[File:Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616) as a young woman from Avengers Origins Ant-Man & the Wasp Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Young Janet]]

As a young woman, Janet lived the life of a rich socialite on her family fortune, having grown an interest in pursuing an education in fashion design. Usually accompanying her father during scientific meetings, she introduced herself to [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]], a young and unconventinonal scientist who experienced frustration for getting ridiculed by his peers due to his shrinking formula based on [[Pym Particles]]. Janet expressed her attraction to Pym by inviting him to dinner when they first met. He initially rejected her advances due to being focused on his research and on mourning [[Maria Trovaya (Earth-616)|his late wife]], but eventually started to go to casual dates with Janet. Simultaneously, Pym secretly implemented his work on himself, becoming the tiny super-hero Ant-Man.<ref>{{cl|Avengers Origins: Ant-Man & the Wasp Vol 1 1}}. It should be pointed out that {{cl|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} states that Pym did not meet Janet or Vernon van Dyne beam until after he became Ant-Man. This since been retconned into a larger narrative as per ''Avengers Origins: Ant-Man & the Wasp'' #1 to create a more diverse and dramatic narrative of the romance between Hank and Janet.</ref>

When Dr. Vernon van Dyne perfected a gamma-ray beam device to contact another world, he accidentally brought a strange [[Pilai (Earth-616)|Creature from Kosmos]]. Dr. van Dyne was murdered by the monster's biologically-produced formic acid. As Janet discovered his father's body, she called Pym for help. As Ant-Man, Pym investigated the murder, trying to track the killer. Noticing Janet's bravery as she wished to avenge her father, he could not help but to recall strong aspects from his late wife. Pym decided to reveal his secret identity to Janet, sharing his intentions of having a partner for his adventures. Grafting synthetic cells of wings and antennae that would protrude from a shrunken-down body, Hank Pym transformed Janet van Dyne into the wondrous '''Wasp'''. Together, Ant-Man and the Wasp eliminated the extradimensional alien, the first of many feats their partnership would give them.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
[[File:Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616) in her first Wasp costume from Avengers Origins Ant-Man & the Wasp Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|First Wasp costume]]

===Early super-hero activities===
As crime fighting duo, Ant-Man and the Wasp fought many villains, including recurrent figures such as [[Elihas Starr (Earth-616)|Egghead]]{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 45}}{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 57}} and [[Alexander Gentry (Earth-616)|Porcupine]].{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 48}}{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 53}} The Wasp, with her savvy and cheerful attitude, proved to be crucially benefitial to Ant-Man's career, as she soon exhibited maestry as an efficient super-heroine. During their initial adventures, she also constantly expressed her wishes of becoming romantically involved with Pym, but kept being rejected by the gloomy widower.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44|48}}

Around this period, Ant-Man and the Wasp received an intercepted transmission cast by the [[Teen Brigade (Earth-616)|Teen Brigade]] about a conflict involving the monstrous [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] and the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] god of thunder [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]. The fight had been in fact orchestrated by Thor's trickster brother [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]]. Alongside [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], Ant-Man and the Wasp clashed with the Hulk until Thor arrived with the defeated Loki and revealed his mischievous part in the whole ordeal. With Loki defeated, the accidentally formed group of heroes unanimously agreed to found an official team. The Wasp came up with their name: the '''[[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]'''.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 1}}

Deciding to augment his powers to be more of a benefit to the Avengers,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 227}} Pym altered a new growth formula to allow him to increase his size, becoming Giant-Man.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 49}} With his new abilities, Giant-Man went into action against the high-speed robber known as the [[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Human Top]]. The Wasp assisted Pym with his training, which granted him success in capturing the Human Top.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 50|51}} A vengeful Human Top grew jealous about the relationship between Giant-Man and the Wasp, gradually becoming obsessed with the figure of the gorgeous Wasp.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 55}} Around this period, in order to improve the Wasp's performance in field, Pym developed a "Wasp's sting" -- a compressed air wrist gun which fired long-range blasts against van Dyne's foes.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 57}}

Having adventures on their own and as active Avengers, Giant-Man and the Wasp faced different adversities.{{r|Avengers Vol 2 2|12}}{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 52|68}} Moreover, the two partners struggled to deal with their affection about each other as the opposite actions of an excessively playful Janet and an emotionally closed Pym constantly undermined any chances of a relationship. This tension escalated after Janet felt rejected after accidentaly damaging equipment of one of Pym's projects. Deciding to leave Giant-Man, Janet abandoned their partnership. She was captured by the Atlantean barbarian [[Attuma (Earth-616)|Attuma]], however. As Giant-Man came to Wasp's rescue, their combined size-changing abilities tricked Attuma into thinking all surface dwellers had such powers, causing him to flee and rekindling their alliance.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 64}} 

Their relationship experienced another dramatic struggle when the Avengers focused on the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] crime syndicate. Their secret leader [[Luchino Nefaria (Earth-616)|Count Nefaria]] invited the Avengers to his castle under the auspices that they were going to a charity gala. With his true intentions revealed, Wasp took a bullet and was critically wounded.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 13}} Rushed to a nearby hospital, with her lung punctured, van Dyne's only hope lied in Dr. Svenson of Norway. After contacting Svenson, the Avengers were shocked that he was actually a [[Kallusians|Kallusian]] alien, who hid from their foes the [[Yirbek]] on Earth. Brought to America, Svenson perfored the needed surgery on the Wasp, successfully saving her life.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 14}} Not long after, the Avengers defeated their archnemeses, the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]]. As the Avengers discussed the future of the group, Giant-Man and the Wasp decided to take a leave of absence after Janet's recent brush with death.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 16}} Regardless, they maintained their partnership as a duo of independent heroes. 

The Human Top's obsession with the Wasp escalated to the point that he kidnapped her, with aims of forcing her to fall in love with him. Tracking van Dyne through her Wasp's cybernetic relays, Giant-Man reached the Human Top's hideout. Defeated by Giant-Man with Wasp's help, the Human Top was handed over to the authorities. The stressful situation helped Pym to profess his love for Janet, and they finally embarked in a romantic relationship.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 68|69}} After this episode, Janet and Hank went into permanent retirement, got engaged to each other and dedicated their lives to scientific research.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 77}}

===Return to the Avengers===
Henry took on a job with the United States government which involved a deep sea drilling operation to search for clues to the origins of life on Earth. Their operation caused earthquakes in the realm of [[Atlantis]] drawing the Sub-Mariner to the drilling platform which he then attacked.{{r|Tales to Astonish #77}} As the soldiers tried to defend the platform a fire broke out. Suddenly and unknown to all, the Sub-Mariner was put under the control of his foe the [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]] and fled the location. Agreeing that the threat of the Sub-Mariner needed to be dealt with, Henry allowed Jan to go seek them out as the Wasp while he stayed behind to continue his research.{{r|Tales to Astonish #78}} En route, Janet was captured by Attuma who believed she was a spy trying to stop his most recent plans to invade the surface world. Jan managed to break free and alert the Avengers, but in turn was captured by the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]].<ref>{{cl|Avengers Vol 1 26}}. The Collector was revealed as the Wasp's captor in {{cl|Avengers Vol 1 28}}</ref> The Avengers ultimately thwarted Attuma's plans for conquest.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 27}}

When Janet failed to turn up, Pym contacted the Avengers and revealed his secret identity to them and returned to Avengers Mansion to try and help them find her. After proving who he was, he was given a new costume and he decided to change his name to Goliath after Captain America called him one. However, after years of inactivity, Pym soon came to the horrific realization that he could only grow to 25 feet in height and that he could only do so for 15 minutes. To change size again any sooner or later would cause serious injury to him. Soon they were contacted by the Collector who challenged the Avengers to come and get him at his secret hideout. There Goliath battled through the Collector's various weapons as well as his minion, the [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|Beetle]]. The team defeated the Collector, who teleported away with the Beetle. Although Jan was save, Henry was in his giant size for too long and quickly tried to change back to normal height. The strain was too much and Pym stopped reducing at 10 feet before passing out.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 28}} The Avengers rushed Goliath back to their headquarters where he was examined by a doctor who confirmed their worst fears: Goliath would be stuck at the height of 10 feet, seemingly for the rest of his life. When learning the news, Pym became deeply depressed fearing that he would be a freak for the rest of his life. He pushed Jan away and then left the mansion. However when the team was captured by the Black Widow, and her minions [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]] and [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Powerman]], he came to their rescue easily trouncing these foes, although they managed to escape.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 29}} The Wasp was later on hand with his teammates during a United States defence briefing.{{r|Tales of Suspense #91}}

[[File:Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616) in her fifth Wasp costume from Avengers Vol 1 31 001.jpg|thumb|left|174px|5th Wasp costume]]
Although his room in the mansion was redesigned to accommodate his 10 foot high stature, he continued to shut out Janet and brood over his disposition. He soon read a newspaper story about his old university professor Dr. Franz Anton who resided in South America. Believing that Anton could cure him of his predicament, Goliath secretly left the Avengers to seek him out without telling anyone where he went. When Pym arrived at Anton's home he found the scientist missing and his lab in shambles. He was soon attacked by members of a group of hidden people from the [[El Dorado (City)|Forbidden Land]]. Goliath fought them off and took one of his attackers prisoner and forced him to take him to the Forbidden Land. There he found that Anton was a prisoner by the [[Keeper of the Flame (Doradian) (Earth-616)|Keeper of the Flame]] who believed that Anton was a spy seeking to steal the secrets of their Cobalt powered flame. Goliath tried to talk sense and petition for Anton's release, but the fanatical Keeper ordered Goliath's death. Before he could be swarmed by the Keeper's legion, he was rescued by [[Prince Rey (Earth-616)|Prince Rey]] who sought to over throw the Keeper.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 30}} Ultimately the Avengers tracked down Goliath, and they managed to douse the flames and escape with Dr. Anton. When Goliath asked Dr. Anton for help, Franz told the hero that there was only one man he knew who could possibly cure him: Henry Pym.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 31}}

Finding new resolve, Goliath decided to try and cure himself of his own affliction instead, and slowly overcame his depression, much to Janet's delight. To assist him in his research he hired African-American biochemist [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Bill Foster]]. One night Bill was attacked by the [[Sons of the Serpent (Earth-616)|Sons of the Serpent]] a racist organization that was determined to eliminate or remove everyone but American-born Caucasians. This attack prompted the Wasp to go to his fellow Avengers to deal with this organization. However, Captain America was captured by the Sons of the Serpent. As a senior member of the Avengers, Goliath took charge of the group and ordered his comrades to pretend to side with the Serpents in order to free Cap and shut them down on the inside.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 32}} This public backing from the Avengers angered Bill who temporarily stopped working with Goliath, unaware that this was all part of his plan to shut the racist organization down. Goliath and the Wasp appeared before a rally organized by the Sons of the Serpent under the auspices that they were throwing in their support. However they denounced the Serpents while Hawkeye freed Captain America. The Avengers then defeated the Serpents Captain America impersonator and revealed that their leader was [[General Chen (Earth-616)|General Chen]], a communist soldier trying to create a propaganda victory against the United States for his country.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 33}} Returning to Avengers Mansion, the Wasp and her teammates were shown the [[Super-Adaptoid (Earth-616)|Super-Adaptoid]] that Captain America had defeated when it broke into the premises. The inert android then copied all of their powers and escaped after battling Captain America.{{r|Tales of Suspense #84}} The Avengers later decided to offer membership to Spider-Man, although the Wasp had her reservations with doing so. Although when the hero was brought before them his quick temper led to he and Goliath to come to blows. Eventually the fight was broken up and Spider-Man was given the mission to capture the Hulk as a test to prove if he was Avengers material. Ultimately, Spider-Man could not bring himself to capture the Hulk as he felt sympathetic toward his alter-ego of Bruce Banner and eventually declined membership.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #3}}. Later Janet became the obsession of a new villain calling himself the [[Arthur Parks (Earth-616)|Living Laser]]. Seeking to win the Wasp's love, the Laser attacked Goliath at his lab, but the man-mountain easily defeated his foe and he was turned over to Captain America and Hawkeye. The Living Laser managed to break free, and instead of going to prison he made Cap, Hawkeye and the Wasp his prisoners.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 34}} Learning that Janet was in trouble, Goliath tracked the Laser down to his base. However by the time he arrived the Living Laser had already absconded with the Wasp to help overthrow the nation of [[Costa Verde]]. As Hawkeye and Captain America made a plan, Goliath and Bill stumbled upon a cure for his condition but Henry kept this a secret. The Avengers then launched an attack against the Laser's forces on Costa Verde. During the course of the battle, Goliath allowed himself to get captured, then used his recently regained shrinking abilities to free himself, and then the Wasp. The Avengers then crushed the Living Laser's invasion. With the communist regime of Costa Verde smashed, the people of the island thanked the Avengers and began setting up a democratic government.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 35}}

The Wasp and her fellow Avengers, and Hawkeye's girlfriend the Black Widow were next lured to the nation of [[Transia]] by the alien being known as [[Ixar (Earth-616)|Ixar]] who had already captured their comrades Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. Ixar had attempted to capture the Avengers in the hopes of transferring their powers into his [[Ultroids]] so that they would have superior abilities to battle an unspecified alien foe.<ref>{{cl|Avengers Vol 1 36}}. Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch previously went to Transia in {{cl|Avengers Vol 1 30}} due to the fact that their powers appeared to be fading. They had believed that this loss of power was tied into the fact that they were away from their homeland. Although it was hinted that this might have been an influenced by the demon [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]] in {{cl|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #2}}</ref> The Wasp and the other Avengers broke free from their bonds and battled the Ultroid's and Ixar's Ultroid form. Meanwhile, Hawkeye and the Black Widow forced Ixar to surrender when the Black Widow threatened to kill the alien, pointing out that she was not bound to the Avengers code of conduct, which forbade killing. Ixar then surrendered and left Earth, but Hawkeye and the Widow kept how they defeated their foe a secret as Hawkeye wished for the Widow to become a member of the Avengers.<ref>{{cl|Avengers Vol 1 37}}. Black Widow broke free from her brainwashing in {{cl|Avengers Vol 1 32}}</ref> When Hawkeye petitioned for the Black Widow to join their ranks, but the group was against it given her past career as a spy and the fact that she attacked them recently. Eventually the Black Widow secretly accepted an offer to work for the counter-espionage agency known as [[Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate (Earth-616)|SHIELD]]. The Avengers were later attacked by the Enchantress who had enthralled the [[Olympians|Olympian]] demi-god [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]]. Hercules was later freed from the spell when Hawkeye attempted to use a surfer arrow and the Enchantress was forced to flee. In the aftermath of the battle, Hercules' father [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus]] appeared and exiled him on Earth for the next year. The Wasp and the others then invited Hercules to stay with them at Avengers Mansion as a guest until his exile was over.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 38}}

When the newspapers reported that the Black Widow had seemingly betrayed her newly adopted country, Hawkeye ran off to be alone and was captured by the [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]] and his technologically enhanced footsoldiers the [[Triumvirate of Terror (Earth-616)|Triumvirate of Terror]]. The Wasp and the others soon fell as well, giving the Thinker access to Avengers Mansion and the [[Stark Industries]] built computers held there. However the Thinker's plan soon fell apart, as he had not foreseen that Hercules was staying with the Avenges and he and his Triumvirate was easily defeated.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 39}} Janet then joined her fellow Avengers on a quest to find the [[Cosmic Cube]], leading to a clash with the Sub-Mariner who had discovered the device first. Although Namor had the advantage, the Cube was eventually taken from him and lost below the surface of the Earth, ending its threat for the time being.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 40}} Following this mission, Captain America began training Janet and the other Avengers putting them through an intense hand-to-hand combat training.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 33}} Henry later got permission to examine the [[Draconus (Earth-616)|Dragon Man]] android as part of his studies on artificial intelligence. However as he began his work, Dragon Man's former controller [[Esteban Corazón De Ablo (Earth-616)|Diablo]] came seeking the creature and restored it to life, leading to a battle between the Dragon Man and Goliath. Goliath proved no match for Dragon Man's brute strength and Diablo took both Goliath and the Wasp prisoner.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 41}} Hank and Janet were then taken to Diablo's castle in Transylvania. Using Jan as a hostage, Diablo forced Pym to begin building an army of Dragon Men in a plot to take over the world. Henry's fellow Avengers came to his aid, but not wishing Janet to be hurt, he was forced to fight his comrades until Hercules managed to defeat the Dragon Man and save her. Diablo was defeated soon after and taken prisoner, while his castle was destroyed.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 42}}

===Ultron===
Hank managed to recover the Dragon Man and began examining it further in order to learn a means to create his own artificial intelligence.{{r|Age of Ultron #6}} To this end he began developing his own robot with artificial intelligence that he called [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]]. When Pym finally completed Ultron, using his own brain engrams to create its personality. The robots artificial intelligence caused its intelligence and independence to increase to the point where Ultron became autonomous, paranoid, and developed on Oedipus Complex. Ultron then used hypnosis forcing him to close up his home and forget that he ever created Ultron so that the robot could upgrade and perfect himself uninterrupted.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 58}} Later when Hawkeye learned that his girlfriend the Black Widow was a prisoner in an Asian country, he and Hercules went to rescue her and became prisoners of the [[Alexi Shostakov (Earth-616)|Red Guardian]]. It was during this period in which Jan turned 23 and she inherited her family fortune. When the Avengers learned of this, Goliath and the Wasp joined their teammates on the rescue mission.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 43}}
[[File:Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616) in her sixth Wasp costume from Avengers Vol 1 45 001.jpg |thumb|123px|6th Wasp costume]]

The Avengers managed to rescue their captured friends, and return to the United States.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 44}} Later when Iron Man's foe the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]] gathered a number of Avengers foes to try and take over the world, every active member of the Avengers at the time were gathered to face the threat. Goliath and the Wasp accompanied Iron Man to South America where they stopped the Swordsman and Powerman from destroying an entire city with a massive explosive sword. The other Avengers were able to stop similar plots and the entire team tracked the Mandarin to his hideout in Asia. Goliath and the others were then forced to fight each other thanks to the Mandarin's hate-ray, but they managed to destroy it. With his plan thwarted, the Mandarin then fled.{{r|Avengers Annual #1}} For their defeat of the Mandarin, the Avengers were celebrated with festivities being held in Central Park. There they were attacked by the Super-Adaptoid, who was trying to complete its programming by killing Captain America. Goliath and the Avengers managed to defeat the android by tricking it into using all of its copied powers at once causing it to short circuit.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 45}} On their way home, Goliath and the Wasp happened past Hank's old house. When Janet asked to go in and get some make-up she left there, Pym's mental conditioning kicked in and he convinced her that he was too tired to go looking, thus keeping Ultron's anonymity in tact.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 135}}

===Hank's Fluctuating Powers===
Goliath and Wasp's old foe the Human Top -- having reinvented himself as a new villain called Whirlwind -- decided to get revenge as his old enemies. Taking on the false identity of Charles Matthews, Whirlwind got a job as Janet's chauffeur. This allowed him to get close enough to his old foes to know when they would be alone in Avengers Mansion. At this time Henry began working on controlling ants again, focusing on red ants, a species that was previously resistant to his mental commands in the past. Whirlwind attacked and used a shrink ray to reduce Goliath and the Wasp down to ant size and then tossed them into the ants habitat. Without their control devices and their size changing powers negated by the shrink ray, the couple were forced to fend for themselves. Eventually Henry got to a miniaturized cybernetic control-center that he made and salvaged it to create a new ant controlling headpiece which worked on the red ant. The pair then escaped their death trap just as Captain America and Quicksilver forced Whirlwind to flee. They then reversed the shrink ray to restore Janet and Henry back to normal.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 46}} Afterwords, the Avengers were rocked when Captain America suddenly decided to quit the team{{r|Avengers Vol 1 47}}, making Hank the chairman to the Avengers{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #1}}. In order to get their minds off of this, Henry and Janet decided to take a trip to Las Vegas.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 47}} The couple were called back to New York when Hawkeye received a distress signal from Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch stating that they had become prisoners of Magneto. However before they could deal with this news, they mansion was approached by the new heroic [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]]. Mistaking him for their old foe, the Wasp and the others battled him. It was during this battle that Hank began to discover his worse fears: that his growing powers were once again causing too much strain to his body forcing him to refrain from using them. After a brief battle they learned this new Black Knight was not a foe, and merely sought to warn them about Magneto's threat before he left, angry that they attacked him.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 48}}{{r|Uncanny Origins #11}}

The Avengers were later dispatched to the United Nations Building when Magneto, the [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]], Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch appeared there. Magneto put up the false pretence that he came to the United Nations to petition them to allow Mutants to have their own independent nation under his rule. When he was flat out refused, he attacked the UN assembly. While the Avengers came to defend the UN, Magneto used the opportunity to cause a guard's gun to fire, and used his magnetic powers to make the bullet crease the Scarlet Witch's brow, convincing Quicksilver to rejoin his side, and they soon fled.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 49}} With no other choice, Goliath was forced to reveal to his teammates that he could no longer use his growing powers. They eventually went to track down Hercules, who had been on a private mission for a number of days. They traced him to Mount Olympus where they assisted Hercules in his battle against [[Typhon (Earth-616)|Typhon]] who had banished the Olympians to the [[Land of Shades]]. Although they defeated Typhon and restored the Olympians, they lost Hercules as a teammate as his exile was lifted and he wished to return to his people.<ref>{{cl|Avengers Vol 1 50}}. Hercules started on his private mission to end his exile in {{cl|Avengers Vol 1 46}}</ref> Goliath then began trying to work on a means of restoring his growing powers but these experiments proved to be nearly fatal, and a failure. Soon the Avengers were once again targeted by the Collector, who captured the Wasp, Hawkeye and Goliath. Before they were imprisoned they found that Thor was already the Collector's slave. Unwilling to have an "incomplete" Avenger, the Collector then began experimenting on Goliath to try and restore his powers. The Avengers however eventually broke free, forcing the Collector to flee. Later, with the help of Thor and Iron Man, Goliath got the assistance he needed to have his growing powers restored to their peak once again.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 51}}

The Avengers were soon targeted by the [[Eric Williams (Earth-616)|Grim Reaper]], who sought revenge against the Avengers as he blamed them for the apparent death of his brother, Wonder Man. Using his scythe, the Reaper put Goliath, the Wasp, and Hawkeye in a death-like state. Ultimately, the Reaper's plans were foiled by the Avenger's newest recruit the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] who restored the Avengers back to normal.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 52}} The group was next approached by the [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] who sought the Avengers to aid the X-Men in stopping Magneto's latest schemes. Finding that Magneto had bugged the Angel and knew they were coming, they set up an elaborate ruse to make it seem like they did not trust the Angel and were prone to in fighting among themselves. While the Avengers were busy fighting the X-Men, who were under Magneto's mind control device, the Angel got the drop on Magneto and destroyed it. The Toad then set the base to explode, and all parties fled the base, all save for Magneto who seemingly perished in the blast.<ref>{{cl|Avengers Vol 1 53}}. The X-Men began battling Magneto in {{cl|X-Men #45}}. Magneto didn't die here, turning up alive and well in {{cl|X-Men #62}}</ref>{{r|Domination Factor: Avengers Vol 1 2}} 

===Ultron Strikes===
Eventually, Ultron had upgraded himself to the point where he felt ready to attack the Avengers in an attempt to try and destroy his "father". To this end, he adopted the guise of the Crimson Cowl. At this time the Avenger's butler [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Edwin Jarvis]] was in desperate need of money for his mothers medical treatments. As the Cowl, Ultron approached Jarvis, offering him the money he needed in exchange for details regarding the security systems at Avengers Mansion. Jarvis went along with the plan thinking that his employers would easily be able to stop their foe. Ultron however hypnotized Jarvis into doing his bidding{{r|Avengers Vol 1 55}}. Ultron then formed a new Masters of Evil, which included past members the Radioactive Man and Melter, as well as Whirlwind and [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Klaw]]. Additionally, Ultron also hired the Black Knight, thinking him the villainous original, and not his heroic successor. When the Masters went to attack Avengers Mansion, the Black Knight tried to tip the Avengers off. This gave the Avengers a chance to fight back, but they were still captured and taken back to the Masters secret hideout. There Ultron had Jarvis "reveal" himself as the Crimson Cowl, while posing as a immobile mechanical construct of the Cowl{{r|Avengers Vol 1 54}}. The Avengers were placed inside a neutron bomb which Ultron intended to use against the city of New York, but the heroes were freed by the Black Knight. During the ensuing battle, Ultron chose to reveal himself and his entire plot but managed to escape while his comrades were defeated by the Wasp and the others.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 55}}

Before the Avengers could figure out why Ultron was seeking to destroy them, they received a call from Captain America and met with him at Dr. Doom's old castle. There Cap wanted to use Doom's [[Time-Platform]] to visit the year 1945 and confirm that Bucky had died during his battle with Baron Zemo in that era. While most of the team went back in time, the the Wasp stayed in the present to man the controls{{r|Avengers Vol 1 56}}. While Janet was watching the controls, the time traveller known as the [[Nathaniel Richards (Scarlet Centurion) (Earth-6311)|Scarlet Centurion]] used one of his devices to make Jan become sleepy and hit one of specific controls{{r|Avengers Annual #2}}. This caused Goliath and the others to materialize before Baron Zemo. This led to a brief clash with the heroes before the Wasp woke up in the present and returned them to their native era{{r|Avengers Vol 1 56}}. However instead of being transported to the present, they were instead transported to the alternate reality of [[Earth-689]]. Returning to Avengers Mansion, the Wasp and the others were shocked to find what appeared to be the original [[Avengers (Earth-689)|Avengers]] meeting at their headquarters. This led to a brief clash where Janet fought an alternate version of herself. Escaping Avengers Mansion, Pym took the Avengers to Long Island university where Herodotus computer was being developed. There they learned that in this reality the Scarlet Centurion appeared before the original Avengers just after their battle with the Space Phantom and convinced them that in order to create a utopia, they had to destroy every other super-human on the planet. Seeing that their Earth-689 counterparts had created a fascist state, Janet and the others recovered the parts of Dr. Doom's Time-Platform, clashing with their counterparts once again. When they reassembled the Time-Platform and activated it, the Scarlet Centurion used it to enter that reality and attack them. Pym shrank down to ant-size and tampered with the controls shunting the Centurion away and transporting them to their native Earth-616. Returned to their proper time, the Avengers were visited by the [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Watcher]] who told the group that the Centurion was a past version of their old foe Kang the Conqueror.{{r|Avengers Annual #2}}{{r|Captain America Annual #11}}

While the Avengers were occupied, Ultron continued to plot against the Avengers, tracking down the Mad Thinker and forcing him to turn over the seemingly inert android body of the original [[Human Torch (Android) (Earth-616)|Human Torch]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 135}}. Unknown to the two villains was that the time traveller Immortus used the [[Forever Crystal]] to create a chronal duplicate of the Torch as part of his on going plans to manipulate the destiny of the Avengers. One copy was taken by Ultron for his purposes, while another was left behind for the Mad Thinker to use for other purposes{{r|Avengers: Forever #8}}. Ultron then took his copy of the Torch and rebuilt it into a new android known as the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]]{{r|Avengers Origins: Vision #1}}{{r|Avengers Vol 1 135}}, using stolen brain engrams of Wonder Man to create the Vision's new personality{{r|Avengers Vol 1 58}}. Ultron then sent the Vision to attack Hank and Janet and kill them.{{citation}}

There are two differing accounts of the Vision's first encounter with the Avengers. In the first account, the Vision attacked Janet's apartment just as Hank left to work on a bacteria culture. Hearing Janet scream for help, Pym raced to her rescue to find the Vision had passed out on the floor. Goliath and the Wasp took the Vision back to Avengers Mansion to examine him, learning that he was an android. The Vision then revived and a battle broke out which ended abruptly when the Vision overcame Ultron's programming. The Vision then led the Avengers to Ultron's hideout where Ultron's body was seemingly destroyed by the Vision{{r|Avengers Vol 1 57}}. Another account states that on the night in question, Hank and Janet had an argument over the amount of time that Hank was spending on his research and how it was neglecting their relationship. This took place at Avengers Mansion and when the Vision attacked, Hawkeye and the Black Panther were there to help. They were also attacked by Ultron at the Mansion and it was here that the Vision seemingly destroyed his creator{{r|Avengers Origins: Vision #1}}. The Avengers then began trying to uncover the mystery of the Vision{{r|Sub-Mariner #8}}, and decided to make him a member of the Avengers. While the Vision was recounting what he knew about his own creation, it also caused Hank to remember his own hand in creating Ultron and the mystery was finally resolved{{r|Avengers Vol 1 58}}. Curious, Hank managed to recover Ultron's head and with Iron Man reactivated it to learn why the robot turned against its creator. Ultron explained that it considered organic life weak and that the it was determined to eliminate all organic life to replace it with mechanical perfection. Pym then shut down Ultron before the disembodied head could attack him{{r|Annihilation: Conquest #5}}. While Ultron appeared to be defeated, he would return to menace Pym and the Avengers again many times in the future.{{citation}}

===Yellowjacket===
Hank called in Iron Man, Thor and Captain America to discuss the addition of the Vision into their ranks, accepting the responsibility as chairman and the pressure he would be getting from both the NSA and SHIELD regarding the matter. Not long after it was agreed that the Vision was to become an active member of the Avengers, SHIELD agent [[Jasper Sitwell (Earth-616)|Jasper Sitwell]] had the Vision arrested for interrogation over possible connections to the missing Super-Adaptoid{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #1}}. Pym was furious over this action and he demanded that Captain America get him an audience with SHIELD director [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]. The meeting with Fury was tense, but a request was put to the table for the Avengers to follow a lead on the Adaptoid. Fury asked the Avengers to assist them in investigating reports that [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|AIM]] had created an army of Adaptoids to attack a small island off the coast of the Philippines. Pym accepted the mission on the condition that SHIELD release the Vision, whom they cleared of any connection with the Super-Adaptoid anyway{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #2}}. When they arrived over the island, the Avengers [[Quinjet]] was shot down and Hank ordered Janet and the others to shut down the AIM facility on the island while he dealt with the army of Adaptoids alone. Growing to giant size, Henry evacuated a nearby village and then faced the army by himself{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #3}}. Janet and the others shut down the AIM facility, and Hank destroyed their army of Super-Adaptoids, but the original Adaptoid itself managed to escape. After getting reamed out by both Nick Fury and NSA special agent [[James Murch (Earth-616)|James Murch]], Hank was plagued by nightmares that evening. Awoken by these nightmares, Hank went out to his lab and in a fit of rage began smashing his equipment{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #4}}. A combination of his emotional stress and the chemicals he inadvertently exposed himself to trigged a schizophrenic episode. His memories of Hank Pym were submerged and his inhibitions were pushed to the fore. He developed a new identity and costume, calling himself Yellowjacket. Unaware of who he was he also fabricated a story in which he believed he had defeated Goliath in battle, shrinking him down to size and leaving him to die at the hands of a spider{{r|Avengers Vol 1 59}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #5}}.

As Yellowjacket, Pym began busting up criminals all over the city before going to Avengers Mansion, subduing Jarvis and then demanding that the group give him membership{{r|Avengers Vol 1 59}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes #5}}. At the time, SHIELD agent Jasper Sitwell was in the mansion and in scanning Yellowjacket's face he found that it was a match to Henry Pym. When the Avengers took private council to consider Yellowjacket's demands Sitwell revealed this to them and also called in SHIELD psych specialist [[Carol Carver (Earth-616)|Agent Carver]]. Carver explained that Pym was going through a state of schizophrenic behaviour and that by exposing the truth to him could do more damage than good and cautioned the Avengers to play along with his delusions until further examination could bring about a treatment. The Avengers grudgingly agreed to do so, although Janet found herself uneasy with seemingly doing nothing for her lover{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #5}}. It was then that Yellowjacket "revealed" that he had "killed" Henry Pym. This led to a clash between Yellowjacket and the Avengers, which ended with the heroes defeat and Janet as Pym's prisoner{{r|Avengers Vol 1 59}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #5}}. It here that Yellowjacket gave into his passions and kissed Janet and the two began talking about their future together. When the Avengers later "rescued" Jan from Yellowjacket, she informed the group that she intended to marry Yellowjacket, much to their shock and surprise{{r|Avengers Vol 1 59}}. Nick Fury was called in, and he was unimpressed with the situation, but Janet insisted that this was something that had to be done. Fury and the other Avengers conceded, agreeing to put on a mock wedding and keeping the truth of the situation a secret to avoid public embarrassment{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #6}}.

===Wedding===
Unknown to Yellowjacket, his teammates were still struggling with how to deal with his current schizophrenic personality, with the Wasp insisting that the wedding had to go through, much to the protest of both the Avengers and SHIELD. Nonetheless, the wedding continued on under SHIELD supervision with all the super-hero guests invited accepting the "twist" wedding{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #6}}. Unknown to all at the time, the catering staff had been replaced by the [[Maynard Tiboldt (Earth-616)|Ringmaster]] and his [[Circus of Crime (Earth-616)|Circus of Crime]] who sought to get revenge against Thor by attacking him at the wedding{{r|Avengers Vol 1 60}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #6}}. The villains hid [[Zelda DuBois (Earth-616)|Princess Python's]] pet boa constrictor in the wedding cake and when Janet went to cut it, the snake attacked{{r|Avengers Vol 1 60}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #6}}.
[[File:Henry Pym (Earth-616) and Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616) are married from Avengers Vol 1 60 001.jpg|thumb|left|The wedding]]

Seeing Janet in peril, Yellowjacket at first cracked under the pressure until suddenly he used his growing powers "revealing" that he was Henry Pym the whole time. He and the Avengers easily defeated the Circus of Crime and turned them over to the authorities{{r|Avengers Vol 1 60}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #7}}. With Pym's mind seemingly restored to health, he accepted the fact that he was married to Janet, as the wedding was technically legal anyhow{{r|Avengers Vol 1 60}}. After the wedding, Hank was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation from Agent Carver, who reported back that while Hank was seemingly back to normal, his mental state was still far from stable{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #7}}. Hank and Janet were returned to the Mansion just as Hawkeye, the Vision, and Black Panther took down the Super-Adaptoid. Later after a SHIELD debriefing over recent events, Hank and Janet decided to leave the group for their honeymoon and reflect on where their relationship was to go from there, but Hank vowed that when they returned they would devote themselves to the Avengers one hundred percent.{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 2 #8}}

===The Honeymoon's Over===
During their honeymoon, Hank deduced that his growing powers was what was partially responsible for his schizophrenic episode and decided to retire as Goliath in favour of maintaining his Yellowjacket identity, using his shrinking powers once again. He revealed this too late to Janet, who had designed a new Goliath costume for him. Initially, Hank and Janet returned to Avengers Mansion to destroy his latest and most powerful growth formula. However before he could, the Avengers were called by what appeared to be Nick Fury and asked to rescue the Black Widow from captivity in the Caribbean. Yellowjacket and the Wasp accompanied the Avengers on this mission, but Hawkeye -- given his past romantic relationship with the Black Widow -- was ordered to stay behind. This turned out to be a trap set by a partnership between Egghead, the Mad Thinker, and the [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]], part of a plot to conquer the world. However while the Avengers were sent on a wild goose chase, Hawkeye took Pym's growth formula and abandoned Goliath costume and rescued the Widow from the villains who had her prisoner at Coney Island, although the villains escaped{{r|Avengers Vol 1 63}}. The other Avengers soon learned that the trio of villains plotted to use a massive satellite to hold the world hostage{{r|Sub-Mariner #14}}. When they returned to base they found Hawkeye missing and began searching for him{{r|Daredevil #52}}. However Goliath and the Black Widow safe and sound{{r|Hawkeye: Blind Spot #2}}, the Avengers were then visited by Golitha's brother, racketeer [[Charles Barton (Earth-616)|Barney Barton]] who provided the group with the location of Egghead's satellite in exchange for being allowed to join them and redeem himself. The Avengers stormed the satellite but were immobilized by some puppets made by the Puppet Master. Barney then seemingly sacrificed his life to stop Egghead, who managed to escape<ref>{{cl|Avengers Vol 1 64}}. Egghead's partners the Mad Thinker and Puppet Master, who had plots of their own, were defeated in {{cl|Sub-Mariner #14}} and {{cl|Captain Marvel #14}} respectively. Barney Barton was revealed to have been an undercover CIA agent in {{cl|Hawkeye Vol 3 #6}} and {{cl|Hawkeye: Blind Spot #3}}. It was later revealed that Barney wasn't truly dead and was put in suspended animation by Egghead and has recently been revived as seen in {{cl|Hawkeye: Blind Spot #3}}</ref>. Egghead continued to target the Avengers, seeking to get revenge against his old foe Henry Pym. He hired the Swordsman to capture both Pym and Hawkeye, unaware of their recent changes in identity. Swordsman, having a past with Hawkeye accepted the job. However, when learning that Clint Barton abandoned his Hawkeye identity for Goliath, he mistakenly assumed that Henry Pym was Goliath and Hawkeye and kidnapped him, leaving the unconscious Yellowjacket behind after his attack on Avengers Mansion. Goliath later revived and captured both the Swordsman and Egghead.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 65}}

Shortly after this, Captain America led the entire world to believe that his identity as Steve Rogers was a false identity, forcing him to create a new one and struggle with his new life of anonymity{{r|Captain America #113}}. Cap's distance from the team worried Yellowjacket, the Wasp and the other Avengers{{r|Captain America #114}}. Later when Cap's arch-nemesis the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] used the Cosmic Cube to swap their bodies{{r|Captain America #114}}, Cap in the Skull's body attempted to warn the Avengers. Yellowjacket, the Wasp and the others attempted to subdue the "Red Skull". When the Avengers and the Cosmic Cube controlled [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]] proved incapable of destroying the Captain America, the Red Skull banished him to [[Exile Island]]{{r|Captain America #116}}. Ultimately, Cap managed to defeat the Red Skull and return his mind to his proper body{{r|Captain America #119}}. The Wasp next joined her fellow Avengers to meet with [[Adamantium]] inventory [[Myron MacLain (Earth-616)|Myron MacLain]] to test the durability of the metal. When it proved as indestructible as claimed, the Vision -- acting on secret programming planted in his mind by Ultron -- stole the Adamantium and Molecular Rearranger needed to forge it to rebuild his creator. The Adamantium constructed Ultron-6 then attacked the Avengers{{r|Avengers Vol 1 66}}. The Wasp and the others were no match for this neigh invulnerable incarnation of their foe and he easily defeated them. Recovering, they followed Ultron back to his former hideout where the robot plotted to set off a nuclear explosion to destroy the city{{r|Avengers Vol 1 67}}. This nuclear holocaust was stopped by the Vision who finally managed to shake off Ultron's influence and save his comrades, but Ultron escaped. Seeking to lure Ultron into a trap, Yellowjacket contacted the Black Panther and had him ship them some [[Vibranium]] from his homeland of [[Wakanda]]. Then, Hank allowed himself to be hypnotized into thinking he was Myron MacLain with the hypnotic suggestion to constantly think of the phrase "thou shall not kill". Then, posing as the noted scientist he presented a speech to the United Nations. As expected, Ultron went after "MacLain" to siphon his knowledge of Adamantium so that Ultron could create an indestructible robot army. Instead, when Ultron attempted to drain "MacLain's" mind he absorbed the hypnotic command. Fighting it, Ultron attempted to self destruct, but the the blast was contained by the Vibranium, and Ultron was seemingly destroyed in the process.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 68}}

===Contest===
The Wasp and the rest of the Avengers came to the aid of their teammate Iron Man who was in the middle of a battle with an [[Life-Model Decoy|Iron Man LMD]]. While they arrived too late for the battle, Iron Man had destroyed his robotic doppelgänger, but at great strain to his frail heart. At the time the Avengers did not know that Iron Man and Tony Stark were one and the same, and were shocked when they unmasked Iron Man's armor to find Stark wearing it. Stark covered for his double identity by telling them that the "real" Iron Man was on another mission leaving him to defend his business alone<ref>{{cl|Iron Man #18}}. The LMD was set against Iron Man by [[Mordecai Midas (Earth-616)|Mordecai Midas]]</ref>. The Avengers rushed Stark to a hospital for treatment. There they were attacked by Kang's [[Growing Man (Earth-6311)|Growing Man]]. The group tried to stop the Growing Man from kidnapping Stark, but the entire team found themselves transported to the year 4000 AD of [[Earth-6311]] by Kang. There they learned that Kang had entered a contest with the cosmic being known as the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] for the life of his lover [[Ravonna (Earth-6311)|Ravonna]]. To this end, Kang agreed to pit the Avengers against champions of the Grandmaster's choosing{{r|Avengers Vol 1 69}}. Janet was held prisoner, while Captain America, Goliath, Thor and Iron Man were pitted against the Grandmaster's [[Squadron Sinister (Earth-616)|Squadron Sinister]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 70}}, Yellowjacket, the Vision and Black Panther found themselves transported to France circa 1941. There they were forced to battle that eras Captain America, Human Torch and Sub-Mariner{{r|Avengers Vol 1 71}}{{r|Invaders Annual #1}}.

With the heroes victorious, Kang sought to destroy his foes, but the Wasp -- with the unexpected assistance of the Black Knight -- freed Captain America, Thor, Iron Man and Goliath. They then attacked Kang and freed the others. The Grandmaster then offered Kang an opportunity: Either having his love Ravonna restored to life, or be given the power to destroy the Avengers. Thirsty for revenge Kang chose the latter, but failed in doing so as the Black Knight was not a member of the Avengers and he easily defeated Kang. The Grandmaster then returned the Avengers and their ally back to their own era. The Wasp then joined her fellow Avengers in accepting the Black Knight into their ranks.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 71}}

===Divorce===
Wasp was once temporarily possessed by the Power Prism fragments, briefly acting as Dr. Spectrum.{{r|Avengers Annual #8}}

Hank later had a breakdown, during which he was captured by Ultron, reverted to his earliest days as Ant-Man, and made to attack the Avengers. During the fighting, it was the Wasp who took down her wayward husband. Janet later suspected that this, being brought down by his own wife, might have further exacerbated Pym's fragile mental state. She had begun seeing a therapist on the side, hoping for insight into how to help Hank's ego.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 161|162}}

When the Avengers were battling the [[Elfqueen (Linnea) (Earth-616)|Elfqueen]], Hank blasted her in the back during a lull in the fighting while Captain America was trying to talk her down.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 212}} This began another round of fighting that caused Captain America to charge Hank for reckless behavior under the Avengers by-laws, since bystanders could have been killed. This began Pym's fourth nervous breakdown. He decided that if he could build a robot to attack Avengers Mansion, he could defeat it and be a hero in the eyes of his teammates. He included a special hidden weak spot on the robot just for the occasion. When Jan protested, Hank lashed out, brutally striking his wife. His plan went awry, and when the robot attacked the mansion, it was the Wasp who disabled it after Hank was overpowered. In the subsequent court-martial, Pym was stripped of his Avengers membership. Meanwhile, Jan began divorce proceedings.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 213}}

[[File:Jennifer Walters (Earth-616) and Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 221 001.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Welcoming She-Hulk]]
With the Avengers consisting only of four members, the team looked for "new blood" that could join their ranks. After meeting some of the world's best superheroines, Janet ended up inviting She-Hulk{{r|Avengers Vol 1 221}} and the two became great friends.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk Vol 1 2}}

===Continued Avengers service and Chairmanship===
Over the years, Janet had become a seasoned hero, a far cry from the ditzy thrill-seeker she had been while first teaming with Pym as Ant-Man. She continued service with the team after Hank's fourth breakdown despite the tremendous stress of the situation. After the divorce, she at times revisited her old dallying romance with Paladin.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 251}}

Janet's long tenure with the Avengers has molded her into an empathetic and savvy leader. She was eventually elected as chairman of the Avengers, a position which she held for some time. During this period, Janet and several other Avengers were among the group of heroes summoned to [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]] by the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] to fight in his [[Marvel Super Heroes: Secret Wars|Secret Wars]]. During the conflict, the Wasp appeared to be seduced by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] after he captured her, but she was merely playing along in order to find out his plans. Temporarily overpowering Magneto and his new allies the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], she escaped in an alien aircraft that soon crashed. Jan took refuge with the outcast [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Lizard]]. [[Dirk Garthwaite (Earth-616)|The Wrecker]] gravely wounded her when the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]] was dispatched by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] to retrieve the Lizard. Left in a death-like state, she was revived by the alien healer [[Zsaji (Earth-616)|Zsaji]].{{r|{{cl|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 1}}-[[Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 12|12]]}}

While Avengers chairman, Jan led the team in discovering [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], an [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Man]] long thought to be dead. Her teammate [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]] had an unrequited crush on her for some time, while another, [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], chafed at being given orders by a woman.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 263|264}}

The most serious test to the Wasp's leadership ability came when the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] under [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Helmut Zemo]] attacked and conquered [[Avengers Mansion]]. Hercules was beaten into a coma by the Masters, and admitted to hospital, and Zemo sent two of the most powerful Masters, [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]] and [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]] to finish him off. With the help of the second [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]], the Wasp defeated the two far stronger villains. With every other active team member incapacitated and a small army of supervillains holding their headquarters, it was up to the Wasp to assemble a rescue squad and mount the assault to retake the mansion.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 273|275}}

The Wasp soon took a leave of absence, but was abducted by the goddess [[Artemis (Olympian) (Earth-616)|Artemis]] on the orders of Hercules' father [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus]], who blamed the Wasp for his son's condition. The Wasp and the rest of the Avengers stood against Zeus and some of his offspring until he saw sense and ended the hostilities.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 282|285}}

Eventually Hank's mental balance returned and he was reinstated as an active Avenger under the name Doctor Pym. Janet was briefly assigned to the West Coast branch alongside Hank after this. The two managed to rekindle a friendship and, some years later, a romance. While on a trip to Las Vegas, however, Jan turned down a marriage proposal of Hank's; she said she would not marry him again.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 71}}

After sustaining severe injuries during the ''Crossing'', Pym put Janet through the same process that had originally given her her powers. This temporarily mutated Janet into an almost completely wasp-like form. In this form, she was among the Avengers who seemingly gave their lives to absorb the energy of [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], in reality being shunted to an [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|alternate dimension]]. She was later returned to normal by [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]], and helped to re-assemble the team after this event. Following a membership evaluation after dealing with [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]], Wasp was left in a reservist role for a time. She was pulled into the Destiny War along with Hank Pym, successfully leading a diverse team of Avengers from various times and realities, and eventually re-attained full membership and even the chairmanship of the team.{{r|{{cl|Avengers Forever Vol 1 1}}-[[Avengers Forever Vol 1 12|12]]}}{{r|Avengers Vol 3 27}}

Janet hosted "America's Next Superstar" for a time. After he rejoined the team, Jan had a dalliance with [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], which left Hank reeling. She soon returned to her longtime, if rocky, flame. Around this time, Jan also began using Pym Particles to grow to immense heights, just as Hawkeye (as Goliath) and Pym had done.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 77|84}}

An offhand remark from the Wasp to the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] regarding the latter's "children" accidentally ignited Wanda's breakdown that left the Avengers disassembled. During the chaos that ensued, the Wasp was badly injured by her good friend [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] who had been driven into an uncontrollable rage, leaving Jan in a brief coma. It was Hank who brought her to the hospital and stayed at her bedside as she recovered. During this time they seem to have finally fully reconciled. Shortly thereafter, Pym received a fellowship at Oxford, and the two moved to England to reconcile and take a break from crime fighting.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 500|503}}{{r|Avengers Finale #1}} Conflicting reports put Jan and Hank back as a couple during this period, and perhaps even remarried. However, their time together did not last for long. Tired of his dedication to his work, she eventually left him and returned to the U.S. to resume her own career as a fashion designer.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 13}}

===Beyond===
Janet was among a group of superhumans who were kidnapped into space and expected to fight to death by the [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]], who was believed to be the Beyonder. Janet took a leadership role during this time, using her experience with the Avengers to help the team with their tactics and the threats they came across. During this time, Janet also told Medusa why she and her ex-husband, who was also among those kidnapped and who was showing a romantic interest in the young hero [[Bonita Juarez (Earth-616)|Firebird]], had been unable to reconcile their relationship. Spider-Man had been believed to have died at the hands of the new [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Venom]], when this was revealed to have been the [[Space Phantom (Temporal Limbo)|Space Phantom]], who was then trapped in limbo. With the help of the new young hero [[Greg Willis (Earth-616)|Gravity]], who gave his life to insure their escape, the group were able to return home to earth, where Janet and the others attended Gravity's funeral.{{r|Beyond! Vol 1 1|6}}

===Civil War and the Mighty Avengers===
During the first [[Civil War (Event)|superhero Civil War]], Janet (who had always been open about her identity) and Hank both supported the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and thus joined Iron Man's Pro-Registration Superhero Unit, with Hank helping spearhead the movement.{{r|Civil War #1}} She hosted a pro-registration reality TV show, ''America's Newest Superhero.''{{r|Eternals Vol 3 1}} Despite being on the Pro-Registration side, Jan was distraught when her friend [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Bill Foster]], a leader of the opposing [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]], was killed in battle by a clone of Thor.{{r|Civil War #4}}

At the end of the Civil War, Iron Man and [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] recruited Janet to the [[Mighty Avengers (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]]. She participated in the retaliation against the Mole Man's biological creations, but when Ultron infected Iron Man by downloading itself into his Extremis armor and held its own against the remaining team, she resorted to calling her ex-husband Hank Pym for help. Janet and Hank were not technically on very good terms even as friends and she was unaware that a Skrull impostor had replaced him for the last several months. She continued to serve with the Mighty Avengers against an alien symbiote-infected populace in New York, and even arresting Doctor Doom.{{r|{{cl|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 1}}-[[Mighty Avengers Vol 1 11|11]]}}

During the Skrull invasion on Earth, Jan, along with her Mighty Avengers teammates and the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], confronted a Skrull spaceship in the [[Savage Land]] and opposed many Skrulls who appeared as various superheroes dressed in older versions of their costumes. Both Avengers groups were taken back to New York by [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] and Agent [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]] of [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] to confront the Skrulls in a final battle. What Janet was unaware of was that a growth serum that 'Hank Pym' (actually the Skrull [[Criti Noll (Clone) (Earth-616)|Criti Noll]] in disguise) had given her a month earlier was tampered with and was designed to transform her into a monolithic, explosive bio-weapon. Criti Noll survived the battle long to activate the new growth serum in a desperate attempt to destroy the Earth following the supposed death of his queen [[Veranke (Earth-616)|Veranke]] in the final battle. Growing hundreds of feet tall with highly visible, and unstable, energy searing out of her body, Janet's former teammate and fellow founding Avenger Thor used his hammer to minimize the damage of the explosion by turning the energy emanated by her body back to herself so she exploded. Thor swore to avenge her death.{{r|Secret Invasion #1|8}}

===Return from the Microverse===
Shortly after after the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers/X-Men conflict]], Janet was revealed to be alive. When Thor hit Janet with lighting, the process of expansion reverted sending her to the Microverse, where she used her Avengers Identi-Card in order to alert the Avengers of her presence. Without knowledge of which Avenger sent the signal, they asked for help from [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Giant-Man]] and traveled with him to the Microverse, where they finally found Janet who was fighting someone named [[Gouzar (Earth-616)|Lord Gouzar]]. After defeating Lord Gouzar and liberating the Microverse from his tyranny, Janet and her fellow Avengers returned to their normal universe.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 32}}
[[File:Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616) from Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 12.jpg|thumb|left|180px]]

She then became a member of the Uncanny Avengers,{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 5}} and had a romance with her teammate [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]]. She would also later return to the Microverse to rescue a family who had been sent there by a new Inhuman's powers, confronting Gouzar again while there.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 20}} In addition to serving on the roster, she privately funded the team in order to avoid the problems that would come with government sponsorship.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 18.NOW}}

===AXIS===
Following the [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]] in which Avengers and X-Men alike joined forces to defeat the Red Skull, a magic spell cast by the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom inverted the moral axis of numerous heroes and villains. Wasp was one of the Avengers who became tyrants.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #4}} However, she was then captured by Captain America, who drained the Pym Particles from her body to use them to shrink and capture anyone who opposed him.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #5}}

The Wasp was later retrieved by Havok when the inverted X-Men stormed the Stark Tower. Alex tried to convince his brother to spare Wasp's life from a gene bomb the X-Men planned to detonate which would've killed every person on the Earth who wasn't a mutant.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #7}} After the bomb's detonation was prevented, Havok freed Wasp and tried to escape with her, claiming he was the one who defused the bomb. After realizing he hadn't done such thing, Janet turned on him and then rejoined the [[Axis (Avengers) (Earth-616)|Axis]] to prevent Steve Rogers from helping the inverted Red Skull reinvert the affected heroes and villains. When a reinversion spell was cast, Wasp became good once again. However, Havok didn't (as he had been accidentally shielded by Iron Man), and used her as a leverage to escape from the heroes.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #9}}

===The Ultron Agenda===
The Wasp was among the Avengers who confronted Ultron when the robot took control of the planetoid [[Titan (Moon of Saturn)|Titan]] and brought it next to Earth with the intention to infect the planet with transmuting spores that carried the [[Ultron Virus]]. During the clash, Hank Pym and Ultron became merged into a single being that fled in terror after realizing what he had become. Janet organized a funeral for Pym, whom the Avengers presumed dead.{{r|Avengers: Rage of Ultron Vol 1 1}}

Months afterwards, the merged Ultron returned to Earth, claiming Hank was in full control of the amalgam and intended to do good. The Wasp caught up with them, with the ulterior motive to analyse their conduct to corroborate if they were truly Hank Pym. Janet flunked them after Ultron's lack of knowledge on certain trivial matters raised several red flags. The Unity Division pressed Pym until his Ultron persona lashed out and they revealed their true intentions.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 10}} The Avengers believed to have dealt with Ultron after forcing him into a remotely-piloted [[Iron Man Armor Model 52|Hulkbuster Armor]] with direction to the [[Sun (Star)|Sun]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 12}} After this incident, Janet remained assisting the Unity Division,{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 15}} and eventually returned to its ranks full time{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 17}} until the team was dissolved along with several other teams of Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 690}}

In the interim, [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Edwin Jarvis]] had brought a young woman named [[Nadia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Nadia]] to the [[Van Dyne Estate]] in [[Southampton (New York)|Southampton]] to introduce her to Janet, as he believed she was the daughter of Hank and his first wife, Maria, who had escaped from the [[Black Widow Ops Program (Earth-616)|Red Room]] and was seeking asylum with family she'd never met.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 9|12}} After a meeting with [[Deborah Forrester (Earth-616)|Deborah Forrester]] at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, Nadia and [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] assisted [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]] in taking down [[Monica Rappaccini (Earth-616)|Monica Rappaccini]], and although the Scientist Supreme escaped, Nadia gleefully spent time with Bobbi, whose work on [[Project Gladiator (Earth-616)|Project: Gladiator]] and adventures in the [[Savage Land]] had inspired her as a child. After mentioning that [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s list of most intelligent [[Homo sapiens|humans]] listed women no higher than 27th, Nadia was prompted to start [[Genius In action Research Labs (Earth-616)|G.I.R.L.]], an enterprise to assess the Earth's greatest female scientific minds and convince S.H.I.E.L.D. that their list was outdated and in need of revision.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 1}} Janet and Bobbi eventually took Nadia and the other young women under their wing, integrating G.I.R.L. into [[Pym Laboratories (Earth-616)|Pym Labs]] where they could better serve as mentors.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 8}}

When [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] became chairman of the reformed Avengers, he enlisted Wasp to become part of the team's support crew, the [[Agents of Wakanda (Earth-616)|Agents of Wakanda]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 12}} Around this time, Janet and Tony Stark acted on their latent romantic feelings for each other and began dating.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 4}} She helped Tony fight off the [[Raiders (Earth-616)|Raiders]],{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 6}} and the [[Basil Sandhurst (Earth-616)|Controller]].{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 7|11}} During one of her outings with Stark, Janet was kidnapped by an amalgamation of Vision and Wonder Man controlled by a returned Ultron,{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 15}} who intended to use a molecular fusion process on Wasp to merge her with Jocasta to become his new bride. Iron Man intervened with the help of [[Aaron Stack (Impostor) (Earth-616)|Machine Man]], and became fused to his armor.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 16}} Janet assisted Tony in unmerging from his suit when he used a process that required him to pilot a [[Iron Man Armor Model 58|Nano Iron Man Armor]] inside his body.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 18}} After Ultron was defeated, Tony came to think that he was an artificial duplicate of his real self, and broke up with Janet since he believed she deserved somebody who was an actual person.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 19}} After Tony sorted out his identity crisis, he and Janet semi-rekindled their relationship, leaving it in the open on where it might go in the future.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 6}} After Tony decided to return to his roots, Janet decided to formally break up with him, both agreeing that it was for the best.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 1}}

| Powers                  = '''Size Reduction:''' Due to long-term exposure to [[Pym Particles]], The Wasp could reduce herself in size, down to the dimensions of the insect from which she takes her name, roughly 1/2 inch in height. She usually chooses not to retain her standard density while at this reduced mass, but can choose to do so at will. The "lost" mass is shunted to a pocket dimension for later retrieval. Additionally, her strength was boosted while she is at reduced size, to the extent that she can bend a one-inch diameter steel bar almost double. Her size allows her to be easily unnoticed in most cases, allowing her to become stealthy in some cases.{{citation}}

'''[[Bio-Synthetic Wings]]:''' Due to small implanted insect wings, the Wasp could fly at incredibly fast speeds. These are functional when she reduced herself in height, and can remain so until reaching a height that is a nearly foot shorter than her normal height. Her flight speed can also allow her to gain a form of superhuman reflexes and agility, being able to easily evade targets and attacks.{{citation}}

'''[[Wasp's Sting]]:''' The Wasp could generate powerful bio-electric blasts from her hand that have been shown to be capable of cutting through high-density structures and is able to cause extreme pain to superhumanly strong and highly durable beings and can pierce their skin.{{citation}}

'''Insect Communication and Control:''' Through the use of her retractable antennae, the Wasp could communicate with and control certain higher insects, in a manner similar to [[Ant-Man's Helmet]]. She rarely chose to utilize this ability, however.{{citation}}

'''Size Addition:''' In addition to being able to shrink, Wasp can grow significantly in size as well.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 77|78}}{{r|Avengers Vol 3 80|81}}{{r|New Invaders Vol 1 0}}{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 8}} The growth process requires the rapid acquisition of bodily mass, presumably from an extra-dimensional source. This extra-dimensional mass should fortify all of her cellular tissues, including her bones and muscles, making it possible to support her increased weight, and giving her superhuman strength and durability.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 10; Dr. Henry Pym's entry}}

| Abilities               = '''Talented Fashion Designer:''' Janet was a very talented fashion designer. During her early days as the Wasp, she would constantly make new costumes for herself and wear different ones for almost every new mission. Over the years her talent earned her great acclaim in the fashion world. Janet's talents also extend to designing costumes for other superheroes; especially her Avengers teammates, including [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Firestar]] and [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]]. She possessed enough costumes of her own to fill either an entire closet or two.{{citation}}

'''Multilingual:''' Janet could speak fluent English, Spanish,{{r|Avengers Vol 3 29|30}}{{r|Unstoppable Wasp #7}} Hungarian,{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 15}} French and Italian.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://princelesscomic.tumblr.com/post/162664078636/janet-speaks-spanish|title=Janet speaks Spanish?|work=Tumblr|first=Jeremy|last=Whitley|date=6 July 2017|accessdate=21 May 2018}}}} She has also taught herself to speak the language of the [[Microverse]].{{r|Avengers Vol 4 31|34}}

'''Gifted Leader:''' While serving as Chairman of the Avengers, Janet proved herself to be a gifted and charismatic leader. She's also an astute diplomat and an avid student of public relations.{{citation}}

'''Gifted Amateur Screenwriter:''' Janet wrote a script, <i>The Coming of The Avengers</i>, which detailed her early adventures with Ant-Man and the formation of the original Avengers. Her screenplay so impressed representatives at the Titan Talent Agency, that they set up a meeting between her and Dino Domani, one of the most financially successful producers in Hollywood.{{r|West Coast Avengers Annual Vol 2 6}}

'''Expert Combatant:''' Janet had adapted to a special kind of hand-to-hand combat that was created by her ex-husband Hank Pym, which takes advantage of the fighter's insect size against a much larger form and physique enabling them to strike pressure points before the opponent even realizes what happened. She was also trained in multiple martial arts and unarmed combat fields by Captain America, making her into an adept combatant.{{citation}}
| Strength                = Janet has the strength of a normal human female of her age, height, and build who engages in moderate regular exercise. The Wasp's strength was boosted when she reduced in size, and increased geometrically when she chose to use her growing powers. At 10 feet tall, she could lift (press) 1,000 pounds, at 25 feet tall she could lift (press) 10 tons, and at 100 feet tall, she could lift (press) 50 tons. The higher she grew past 25 feet, the more of her strength she had to use simply to support her own enormous mass.{{citation}}
| Weaknesses              = 

| Equipment               = '''[[Wasp's Suit]]:''' At first Janet needed the suit to release the [[Pym Particles]] that allowed her to shrink but due to repeat exposure she was able to produce the particles herself. During her early days as the Wasp, she would constantly make new costumes for herself and wear different ones for almost every new mission. Even today, she changes costumes more often than most other superheroes.{{citation}}

| Notes                   = 
* According to [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]], there was a strong physical resemblance between Janet Van Dyne and [[Maria Trovaya (Earth-616)|Maria Trovaya]]; however, Janet was much younger than Maria.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} 
* During her first meeting with Henry Pym, Janet found him quite handsome. She quickly dismissed the possibility of a romantic relationship with him, because she considered him a dull, intellectual bookworm. Her ideal man (at the time) was an adventurer.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} 
* Henry Pym initially though Janet to be quite typical for a bored, society playgirl. With closer interaction between them, Pym discovered that she had both determination and strength of character.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} He was apparently not bothered that her main motivation was avenging her father's death, since his own motivation in becoming a hero was avenging his wife's death. They both took oaths of vengeance, before becoming Avengers.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
* When Janet initially informed [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]] that her father had been murdered and asked for his help, Henry hanged up the phone on her. He assumed that this was a prank call, and that Janet was lying to him. He only responded to her request for help, when [[Ant-Man's Ants]] confirmed that [[Vernon Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Vernon Van Dyne]] had been killed.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
* Janet supposedly chose Henry Pym as the first person to contact for help following Vernon's death, purely because her father considered Henry trustworthy, seemingly ignoring that the two men barely knew each other, and that they had met in person only once.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
*Janet loved her father, but never told him how much she appreciated him. In reaction to his death, she proclaimed that "there is one thing I can do...avenge him!".{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} She also vowed to find out who had killed him, even if it took the rest of her life to do it.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
*During her first mission as the Wasp, Janet admitted that she was falling in love with Henry Pym. She wanted to tell him before either of them died in battle.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
*Henry Pym initially denied Janet's romantic affections, for two reasons. First, that Janet was much younger than him, and (in his view) still a child. Second, that he had already lost one loved one (Maria Trovaya), and never wanted to lose a second one. He was determined never to love anyone.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
*While Ant-Man lectured the Wasp on how inappropriate her expressions on affection were, she did not believe a word. Janet was amused to notice that Ant-Man was blushing while speaking to her.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}

| Trivia                  = 
* Wasp chose the name Avengers for the team.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 1}} The [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] also took his name from a description of him by the Wasp.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 57}}
* Wasp is a Protestant.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 105}}
