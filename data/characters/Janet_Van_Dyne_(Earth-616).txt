| Overview =  '''Janet van Dyne''' is a fashion designer and socialite who is well known as the winsome '''[[Wasp]]'''. Following the death of [[Vernon Van Dyne (Earth-616)|her father]] at the hands of an [[Creatures (Kosmos)|extradimensional creature]], she was infused with [[Pym Particles]] and was biologically altered by his colleague scientist [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Dr. Hank Pym]], secretly the vigilante known as Ant-Man. As the Wasp, she became Pym's super-hero partner, having the ability to alter her size, fly at rapid speeds with [[Bio-Synthetic Wings|synthetic wings]] and fire energy stings.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} Alongside her partner, the Wasp is a founding member of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", being personally responsible to choose the name of the group.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 1}}

The Wasp eventually got married to Pym,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 60}} but their relationship would turn out to be a tragic experience as she became a victim of domestic violence.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 213}} She has weaponized the pain of her hurtful divorce by becoming one of the most prominent, efficient and empathetic Avengers' leaders.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 217}}{{r|Avengers Vol 3 27}} During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]], the Wasp had her powers tampered with to serve as a last suicide attack for the aliens. Her apparent death actually led to the end of the war, and Earth was protected through her sacrifice.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 8}} She was later found lost in [[Microverse]] by the original Avengers and returned to her super-heroic career.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 34}}

More recently, the Wasp has been part of multiple activities. She was part of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Unity Division]], an initiative aimed to integrate mutant and human super-heroes,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 5}} and became an [[Agents of Wakanda (Earth-616)|Agent of Wakanda]], working closely with the Avengers again.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 10}} Moreover, by acting as an inspiring mentor to [[Nadia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|the new Wasp]], her step-daughter, van Dyne has also assumed a motherly attitude.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 10}}

| History                 = 
===The Winsome Wasp===
'''Janet van Dyne''' was born into a wealthy family. Her family fortune was amassed by her uncle, textile magnate [[Blaine Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Blaine van Dyne]], and his wife, talented fashion designer [[Amelia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Amelia]].{{r|1939 Daily Bugle #1}} Janet's father was world-renowned scientist [[Vernon Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Dr. Vernon van Dyne]]{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} and her mother was a vibrant and creative woman who unfortunately sustained an incapacitating brain injury in a car accident when Janet was a child. Being in a vegetative state for years, Janet's mother sadly withered away and died.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 7}}
[[File:Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616) as a young woman from Avengers Origins Ant-Man & the Wasp Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Young Janet]]

As a young woman, Janet lived the life of a rich socialite on her family fortune, having grown an interest in pursuing an education in fashion design. Usually accompanying her father during scientific meetings, she introduced herself to [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]], a young and unconventinonal scientist who experienced frustration by getting ridiculed for his shrinking formula based on [[Pym Particles]]. Janet expressed her attraction to Pym by inviting him to dinner when they first met. He initially rejected her advances due to being focused on his research and on mourning [[Maria Trovaya (Earth-616)|his late wife]], but eventually started to go to casual dates with Janet. Simultaneously, Pym secretly implemented his work on himself, acting as the tiny super-hero Ant-Man.<ref>{{cl|Avengers Origins: Ant-Man & the Wasp Vol 1 1}}. It should be pointed out that {{cl|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} states that Pym did not meet Janet or Vernon van Dyne beam until after he became Ant-Man. This since been retconned into a larger narrative as per ''Avengers Origins: Ant-Man & the Wasp'' #1 to create a more diverse and dramatic narrative of the romance between Hank and Janet.</ref>

When Dr. Vernon van Dyne perfected a gamma-ray beam device to contact another world, he accidentally brought a strange [[Pilai (Earth-616)|Creature from Kosmos]]. Dr. van Dyne was murdered by the monster's biologically-produced formic acid. As Janet discovered his father's body, she called Pym for help. As Ant-Man, Pym investigated the murder, trying to track the killer. Noticing Janet's bravery as she wished to avenge her father, he could not help but to recall strong aspects from his late wife. Pym decided to reveal his secret identity to Janet, sharing his intentions of having a partner for his adventures. Grafting synthetic cells of wings and antennae that would protrude from a shrunken-down body, Hank Pym transformed Janet van Dyne into the wondrous '''Wasp'''. Together, Ant-Man and the Wasp eliminated the extradimensional alien, the first of many feats their partnership would give them.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
[[File:Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616) in her first Wasp costume from Avengers Origins Ant-Man & the Wasp Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|First Wasp costume]]

As crime fighting duo, Ant-Man and the Wasp fought many villains, including recurrent figures such as [[Elihas Starr (Earth-616)|Egghead]]{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 45}}{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 57}} and [[Alexander Gentry (Earth-616)|Porcupine]].{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 48}}{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 53}} The Wasp, with her savvy and cheerful attitude, proved to be crucially benefitial to Ant-Man's career, as she soon exhibited maestry as an efficient super-heroine. During their initial adventures, she also constantly expressed her wishes of becoming romantically involved with Pym, but kept being rejected by the gloomy widower.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44|48}}

===Avenger===
Around this period, Ant-Man and the Wasp received an intercepted transmission cast by the [[Teen Brigade (Earth-616)|Teen Brigade]] about a conflict involving the monstrous [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] and the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] god of thunder [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]. The fight had been in fact orchestrated by Thor's trickster brother [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]]. Alongside [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], Ant-Man and the Wasp clashed with the Hulk until Thor arrived with the defeated Loki and revealed his mischievous part in the whole ordeal. With Loki defeated, the accidentally formed group of heroes unanimously agreed to found an official team. The Wasp came up with their name: the '''[[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]'''.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 1}}

Deciding to augment his powers to be more of a benefit to the Avengers,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 227}} Pym altered a new growth formula to allow him to increase his size, becoming Giant-Man.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 49}} With his new abilities, Giant-Man went into action against the high-speed robber known as the [[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Human Top]]. The Wasp assisted Pym with his training, which granted him success in capturing the Human Top.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 50|51}} A vengeful Human Top grew jealous about the relationship between Giant-Man and the Wasp, gradually becoming obsessed with the figure of the gorgeous Wasp.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 55}} Around this period, in order to improve the Wasp's performance in field, Pym developed a "Wasp's sting" -- a compressed air wrist gun which fired long-range blasts against van Dyne's foes.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 57}}

Having adventures on their own and as active Avengers, Giant-Man and the Wasp faced different adversities.{{r|Avengers Vol 2 2|12}}{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 52|68}} Moreover, the two partners struggled to deal with their affection about each other as the opposite actions of an excessively playful Janet and an emotionally closed Pym constantly undermined any chances of a relationship. This tension escalated after Janet felt rejected after accidentaly damaging equipment of one of Pym's projects. Deciding to leave Giant-Man, Janet abandoned their partnership. She was captured by the Atlantean barbarian [[Attuma (Earth-616)|Attuma]], however. As Giant-Man came to Wasp's rescue, their combined size-changing abilities tricked Attuma into thinking all surface dwellers had such powers, causing him to flee and rekindling their alliance.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 64}} 

Their relationship experienced another dramatic struggle when the Avengers focused on the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] crime syndicate. Their secret leader [[Luchino Nefaria (Earth-616)|Count Nefaria]] invited the Avengers to his castle under the auspices that they were going to a charity gala. With his true intentions revealed, Wasp took a bullet and was critically wounded.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 13}} Rushed to a nearby hospital, with her lung punctured, van Dyne's only hope lied in Dr. Svenson of Norway. After contacting Svenson, the Avengers were shocked that he was actually a [[Kallusians|Kallusian]] alien, who hid from their foes the [[Yirbek]] on Earth. Brought to America, Svenson perfored the needed surgery on the Wasp, successfully saving her life.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 14}} Not long after, the Avengers defeated their archnemeses, the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]]. As the Avengers discussed the future of the group, Giant-Man and the Wasp decided to take a leave of absence after Janet's recent brush with death.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 16}} Regardless, they maintained their partnership as a duo of independent heroes. 

The Human Top's obsession with the Wasp escalated to the point that he kidnapped her, with aims of forcing her to fall in love with him. Tracking van Dyne through her Wasp's cybernetic relays, Giant-Man reached the Human Top's hideout. Defeated by Giant-Man with Wasp's help, the Human Top was handed over to the authorities. The stressful situation helped Pym to profess his love for Janet, and they finally embarked in a romantic relationship.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 68|69}} After this episode, Janet and Hank went into permanent retirement, got engaged to each other and dedicated their lives to scientific research.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 77}}

===Return to the Avengers===
Pym took on a job involving a deep sea drilling operation to search for clues to the origins of life on Earth. Their operation caused earthquakes in [[Atlantis]] drawing [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] to attack their drilling platform. Considering that the threat of the Sub-Mariner needed to be dealt with as the savage Atlantean marched to New York City, Janet decided to seek the Avengers out.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 77|78}} En route, she was captured by Attuma, who believed her to be a spy trying to stop his most recent plans to invade the surface world. The Wasp managed to break free and alert the Avengers, but in turn was captured by the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]].<ref>{{cl|Avengers Vol 1 26}}. The Collector was revealed as the Wasp's captor in {{cl|Avengers Vol 1 28}}</ref> The Avengers ultimately thwarted Attuma's plans for conquest.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 27}}

With the Wasp missing, Pym contacted the Avengers for help and rejoined the group rebranding himself as Goliath. They were unexpectedly contacted by the Collector, who challenged the Avengers to come and get him at his secret hideout. There the Avengers battled through the Collector's various weapons, as well as his minion, the [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|Beetle]]. The team defeated the Collector, who teleported away with the Beetle. The Wasp was freed, but Goliath found himself permanently trapped in his giant size form, a result of a long time with no practice with his powers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 28}} Deeply depressed, Pym pushed Wasp away and even left the mansion. However, when the team was captured by the [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], and her minions [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]] and [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Powerman]], Goliath and the Wasp fully returned to Avengers duty, coming to their rescue easily trouncing these foes, although they managed to escape.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 29}}

When Pym realized that his old university professor [[Franz Anton (Earth-616)|Dr. Franz Anton]] could represent a solution to his problem, he secretly went to South America, believing that Anton could cure him. There he found that Anton was a prisoner by the [[Keeper of the Flame (Doradian) (Earth-616)|Keeper of the Flame]]. The Wasp and the Avengers tracked down Goliath and escaped with Dr. Anton. When Goliath finally asked Dr. Anton for help, he told the hero that there was only one man he knew who could possibly cure him: Dr. Henry Pym.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 31}} Pym slowly overcame his depression by getting used to his condition, much to Janet's delight. However, their relationship experienced a minor turmoil after Pym decided to rudely dismiss Janet as his assistant, hiring biochemist [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Bill Foster]] to replace her.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 32}}

As a public figure for her activities as a socialite and as an Avenger, Janet became the obsession of a new villain, [[Lucy Barton (Earth-616)|her friend]]'s ex-boyfriend, Arthur Parks the [[Arthur Parks (Earth-616)|Living Laser]]. Seeking to win the Wasp's love, the Laser attacked Goliath at his lab, but the man-mountain easily defeated his foe and he was turned over to fellow Avengers [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]]. The Living Laser broke free and made the Wasp and the Avengers his prisoners.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 34}} Learning that the Avengers were in trouble, Goliath tracked the Laser down to his base. However, by the time he arrived the Living Laser had already absconded with the Wasp to help overthrow the nation of [[Costa Verde]]. The Avengers launched an attack against the Laser's forces. During the course of the battle, Goliath allowed himself to get captured. Previously regaining his shrinking with Foster's help, he was able to free himself and the Wasp. The Avengers then crushed the Living Laser's invasion.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 35}}

When examining the [[Draconus (Earth-616)|Dragon Man]] as part of his initial studies on artificial intelligence, Pym was approached by Dragon Man's former controller, [[Esteban Corazón De Ablo (Earth-616)|Diablo]]. Seeking the creature to be restored to life, Diablo took both Goliath and the Wasp as his prisoners.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 41}} Having the Wasp as a hostage, Diablo forced Goliath to build an army of Dragon Men in a plot to take over the world. The Avengers came to help, but not wishing Janet to be hurt, Goliath was forced to fight his comrades. However, the Avengers' newest ally [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] defeated the Dragon Man and saved the Wasp, taking Diablo prisoner and destroying his castle.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 42}} Following this adventure, van Dyne turned 23 and fully inherited her family fortune.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 43}}

The Wasp's stalker the Human Top -- having reinvented himself as the Whirlwind -- decided to get revenge against his old enemies. Taking on the false identity of Charles Matthews, Whirlwind worked as Janet's chauffeur. This allowed him to get close enough to his old foes to know when they would be alone in the Avengers Mansion. Whirlwind made his move, using a shrink ray to reduce Goliath and the Wasp down to ant size and toss them into Pym's ants habitat. Without their control devices and their size changing powers negated by the shrink ray, the couple were forced to fend for themselves against the insects. Eventually Pym got to a miniaturized cybernetic control-center, creating a new ant-controlling headpiece which allowed them to escape their death trap. Whirlwind was forced to flee when confronted by the other Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 46}} In order to get their minds off of this drama, Janet and Hank decided to take a short vacation trip to Las Vegas.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 47|48}}

===Marrying Yellowjacket===
After fighting many enemies, the Wasp and the Avengers met one of their most formidable foes in the form of [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]], the living automaton. Masquerading as the Crimson Cowl and manipulating the Avenger's butler, [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Edwin Jarvis]], Ultron attacked the Avengers with a new group of Masters of Evil, which included Whirlwind. Helped by the [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]], the Avengers were victorious. During the ensuing battle, Ultron chose to reveal himself and his entire plot, managing to escape while his comrades were defeated by the Wasp and the others.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 54|55}} Ultron continued to plot against the Avengers by sending a creation of his own to infiltrate the Avengers Mansion: [[Vision (Earth-616)|a synthetic man with ethereal abilities]]. Shocked by the lifeless and unearthly apparition inside her quarters, the Wasp verbally expressed her terror of such an inhuman "vision". As the other Avengers came to her rescue, the android was incapacitated and then analyzed. Adopting the name Vision after the Wasp's reaction, the artificial man overcame Ultron's programming and led the Avengers to his former master's hideout. Ultron was destroyed, but the mystery behind his hate against the Avengers remained.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 57}} As they investigated, the Avengers came upon the ruins of one of Pym's former laboratories. There, Pym had access to records of himself creating Ultron, a consequece of his interest on artificial intelligence for studying Dragon Man. Ultron, having a fast-evolving intelligence, rebelled against his "father". As a final act, Ultron erased Pym's memory about his existence and left him. Later, Janet found her debilitated partner, but only after any signs of Ultron were vanished.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 58}}

Ultron's attack proved to have a deep impact on Pym's psyche. This was aggravated by a combination of his emotional repression and the chemicals he had inadvertently been exposed himself to, which trigged a schizophrenic episode. His memories of Hank Pym were submerged and his inhibitions were pushed to the fore. Developing a new identity as the chauvinistic Yellowjacket in order to antagonize Goliath's attitude, Hank Pym forged himself into an assertive lover to the Wasp. Using his villainous new alias, he also fabricated a story in which he believed he had defeated Goliath in battle, shrinking him down to size and leaving him to die at the hands of a spider. The grieving Avengers clashed with their teammate's "murderer", which ended with the heroes defeated and Janet van Dyne as Yellowjacket's prisoner. When the Avengers came to The Wasp's rescue, much to their shock and surprise, she informed them that she intended to marry her obnoxious captor.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 59}} 

[[File:Henry Pym (Earth-616) and Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616) are married from Avengers Vol 1 60 001.jpg|thumb|left|The wedding]]
A bizarre wedding ceremony went through, and the catering staff had been unknowingly replaced by the [[Maynard Tiboldt (Earth-616)|Ringmaster]] and his [[Circus of Crime (Earth-616)|Circus of Crime]]. Seeing Janet in peril at the hands of the villains, Yellowjacket at first cracked under the pressure until he used Goliath's growing powers, "revealing" to his teammates that he was Hank Pym the whole time. The Avengers then easily defeated the Circus of Crime and turned them over to the authorities. With Pym's mind seemingly restored, the just married couple was able to enjoy some happiness.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 60}}

During their honeymoon, Pym deduced that his growing powers were partially responsible for his schizophrenic episode and decided to retire as Goliath in favour of maintaining his Yellowjacket identity, using his shrinking powers once again. With the end of their honeymoon, the Wasp and her husband accompanied the Avengers on a mission to rescue the Black Widow in the Caribbean, which turned out to be a trap set by a partnership between Egghead, the [[Mad Thinker (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]], and the [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]], part of a plot to conquer the world. Taking the growing formula and adopting the Goliath identity, Hawkeye helped the other Avengers to stop the villains and rescue the Black Widow.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 63}}. Egghead continued to target the Avengers, seeking to get revenge against his old foes Hank Pym and the Wasp, but with no success.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 64|65}} This was followed by another ghost of the Pyms' past, in the form of failed attack performed by a recovered Ultron.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 66|68}} Following other mission alongside his wife and the Avengers, Pym was eventually offered an assignment by the government. Since he accepted the proposal, Yellowjacket and the Wasp permanently left the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 75}}

===Divorce===
Wasp was once temporarily possessed by the Power Prism fragments, briefly acting as Dr. Spectrum.{{r|Avengers Annual #8}}

Hank later had a breakdown, during which he was captured by Ultron, reverted to his earliest days as Ant-Man, and made to attack the Avengers. During the fighting, it was the Wasp who took down her wayward husband. Janet later suspected that this, being brought down by his own wife, might have further exacerbated Pym's fragile mental state. She had begun seeing a therapist on the side, hoping for insight into how to help Hank's ego.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 161|162}}

When the Avengers were battling the [[Elfqueen (Linnea) (Earth-616)|Elfqueen]], Hank blasted her in the back during a lull in the fighting while Captain America was trying to talk her down.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 212}} This began another round of fighting that caused Captain America to charge Hank for reckless behavior under the Avengers by-laws, since bystanders could have been killed. This began Pym's fourth nervous breakdown. He decided that if he could build a robot to attack Avengers Mansion, he could defeat it and be a hero in the eyes of his teammates. He included a special hidden weak spot on the robot just for the occasion. When Jan protested, Hank lashed out, brutally striking his wife. His plan went awry, and when the robot attacked the mansion, it was the Wasp who disabled it after Hank was overpowered. In the subsequent court-martial, Pym was stripped of his Avengers membership. Meanwhile, Jan began divorce proceedings.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 213}}

[[File:Jennifer Walters (Earth-616) and Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 221 001.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Welcoming She-Hulk]]
With the Avengers consisting only of four members, the team looked for "new blood" that could join their ranks. After meeting some of the world's best superheroines, Janet ended up inviting She-Hulk{{r|Avengers Vol 1 221}} and the two became great friends.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk Vol 1 2}}

===Continued Avengers service and Chairmanship===
Over the years, Janet had become a seasoned hero, a far cry from the ditzy thrill-seeker she had been while first teaming with Pym as Ant-Man. She continued service with the team after Hank's fourth breakdown despite the tremendous stress of the situation. After the divorce, she at times revisited her old dallying romance with Paladin.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 251}}

Janet's long tenure with the Avengers has molded her into an empathetic and savvy leader. She was eventually elected as chairman of the Avengers, a position which she held for some time. During this period, Janet and several other Avengers were among the group of heroes summoned to [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]] by the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] to fight in his [[Marvel Super Heroes: Secret Wars|Secret Wars]]. During the conflict, the Wasp appeared to be seduced by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] after he captured her, but she was merely playing along in order to find out his plans. Temporarily overpowering Magneto and his new allies the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], she escaped in an alien aircraft that soon crashed. Jan took refuge with the outcast [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Lizard]]. [[Dirk Garthwaite (Earth-616)|The Wrecker]] gravely wounded her when the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]] was dispatched by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] to retrieve the Lizard. Left in a death-like state, she was revived by the alien healer [[Zsaji (Earth-616)|Zsaji]].{{r|{{cl|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 1}}-[[Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 12|12]]}}

While Avengers chairman, Jan led the team in discovering [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], an [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Man]] long thought to be dead. Her teammate [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]] had an unrequited crush on her for some time, while another, [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], chafed at being given orders by a woman.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 263|264}}

The most serious test to the Wasp's leadership ability came when the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] under [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Helmut Zemo]] attacked and conquered [[Avengers Mansion]]. Hercules was beaten into a coma by the Masters, and admitted to hospital, and Zemo sent two of the most powerful Masters, [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]] and [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]] to finish him off. With the help of the second [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]], the Wasp defeated the two far stronger villains. With every other active team member incapacitated and a small army of supervillains holding their headquarters, it was up to the Wasp to assemble a rescue squad and mount the assault to retake the mansion.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 273|275}}

The Wasp soon took a leave of absence, but was abducted by the goddess [[Artemis (Olympian) (Earth-616)|Artemis]] on the orders of Hercules' father [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus]], who blamed the Wasp for his son's condition. The Wasp and the rest of the Avengers stood against Zeus and some of his offspring until he saw sense and ended the hostilities.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 282|285}}

Eventually Hank's mental balance returned and he was reinstated as an active Avenger under the name Doctor Pym. Janet was briefly assigned to the West Coast branch alongside Hank after this. The two managed to rekindle a friendship and, some years later, a romance. While on a trip to Las Vegas, however, Jan turned down a marriage proposal of Hank's; she said she would not marry him again.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 71}}

After sustaining severe injuries during the ''Crossing'', Pym put Janet through the same process that had originally given her her powers. This temporarily mutated Janet into an almost completely wasp-like form. In this form, she was among the Avengers who seemingly gave their lives to absorb the energy of [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], in reality being shunted to an [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|alternate dimension]]. She was later returned to normal by [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]], and helped to re-assemble the team after this event. Following a membership evaluation after dealing with [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]], Wasp was left in a reservist role for a time. She was pulled into the Destiny War along with Hank Pym, successfully leading a diverse team of Avengers from various times and realities, and eventually re-attained full membership and even the chairmanship of the team.{{r|{{cl|Avengers Forever Vol 1 1}}-[[Avengers Forever Vol 1 12|12]]}}{{r|Avengers Vol 3 27}}

Janet hosted "America's Next Superstar" for a time. After he rejoined the team, Jan had a dalliance with [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], which left Hank reeling. She soon returned to her longtime, if rocky, flame. Around this time, Jan also began using Pym Particles to grow to immense heights, just as Hawkeye (as Goliath) and Pym had done.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 77|84}}

An offhand remark from the Wasp to the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] regarding the latter's "children" accidentally ignited Wanda's breakdown that left the Avengers disassembled. During the chaos that ensued, the Wasp was badly injured by her good friend [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] who had been driven into an uncontrollable rage, leaving Jan in a brief coma. It was Hank who brought her to the hospital and stayed at her bedside as she recovered. During this time they seem to have finally fully reconciled. Shortly thereafter, Pym received a fellowship at Oxford, and the two moved to England to reconcile and take a break from crime fighting.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 500|503}}{{r|Avengers Finale #1}} Conflicting reports put Jan and Hank back as a couple during this period, and perhaps even remarried. However, their time together did not last for long. Tired of his dedication to his work, she eventually left him and returned to the U.S. to resume her own career as a fashion designer.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 13}}

===Beyond===
Janet was among a group of superhumans who were kidnapped into space and expected to fight to death by the [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]], who was believed to be the Beyonder. Janet took a leadership role during this time, using her experience with the Avengers to help the team with their tactics and the threats they came across. During this time, Janet also told Medusa why she and her ex-husband, who was also among those kidnapped and who was showing a romantic interest in the young hero [[Bonita Juarez (Earth-616)|Firebird]], had been unable to reconcile their relationship. Spider-Man had been believed to have died at the hands of the new [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Venom]], when this was revealed to have been the [[Space Phantom (Temporal Limbo)|Space Phantom]], who was then trapped in limbo. With the help of the new young hero [[Greg Willis (Earth-616)|Gravity]], who gave his life to insure their escape, the group were able to return home to earth, where Janet and the others attended Gravity's funeral.{{r|Beyond! Vol 1 1|6}}

===Civil War and the Mighty Avengers===
During the first [[Civil War (Event)|superhero Civil War]], Janet (who had always been open about her identity) and Hank both supported the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and thus joined Iron Man's Pro-Registration Superhero Unit, with Hank helping spearhead the movement.{{r|Civil War #1}} She hosted a pro-registration reality TV show, ''America's Newest Superhero.''{{r|Eternals Vol 3 1}} Despite being on the Pro-Registration side, Jan was distraught when her friend [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Bill Foster]], a leader of the opposing [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]], was killed in battle by a clone of Thor.{{r|Civil War #4}}

At the end of the Civil War, Iron Man and [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] recruited Janet to the [[Mighty Avengers (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]]. She participated in the retaliation against the Mole Man's biological creations, but when Ultron infected Iron Man by downloading itself into his Extremis armor and held its own against the remaining team, she resorted to calling her ex-husband Hank Pym for help. Janet and Hank were not technically on very good terms even as friends and she was unaware that a Skrull impostor had replaced him for the last several months. She continued to serve with the Mighty Avengers against an alien symbiote-infected populace in New York, and even arresting Doctor Doom.{{r|{{cl|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 1}}-[[Mighty Avengers Vol 1 11|11]]}}

During the Skrull invasion on Earth, Jan, along with her Mighty Avengers teammates and the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], confronted a Skrull spaceship in the [[Savage Land]] and opposed many Skrulls who appeared as various superheroes dressed in older versions of their costumes. Both Avengers groups were taken back to New York by [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] and Agent [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]] of [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] to confront the Skrulls in a final battle. What Janet was unaware of was that a growth serum that 'Hank Pym' (actually the Skrull [[Criti Noll (Clone) (Earth-616)|Criti Noll]] in disguise) had given her a month earlier was tampered with and was designed to transform her into a monolithic, explosive bio-weapon. Criti Noll survived the battle long to activate the new growth serum in a desperate attempt to destroy the Earth following the supposed death of his queen [[Veranke (Earth-616)|Veranke]] in the final battle. Growing hundreds of feet tall with highly visible, and unstable, energy searing out of her body, Janet's former teammate and fellow founding Avenger Thor used his hammer to minimize the damage of the explosion by turning the energy emanated by her body back to herself so she exploded. Thor swore to avenge her death.{{r|Secret Invasion #1|8}}

===Return from the Microverse===
Shortly after after the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers/X-Men conflict]], Janet was revealed to be alive. When Thor hit Janet with lighting, the process of expansion reverted sending her to the Microverse, where she used her Avengers Identi-Card in order to alert the Avengers of her presence. Without knowledge of which Avenger sent the signal, they asked for help from [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Giant-Man]] and traveled with him to the Microverse, where they finally found Janet who was fighting someone named [[Gouzar (Earth-616)|Lord Gouzar]]. After defeating Lord Gouzar and liberating the Microverse from his tyranny, Janet and her fellow Avengers returned to their normal universe.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 32}}
[[File:Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616) from Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 12.jpg|thumb|left|180px]]

She then became a member of the Uncanny Avengers,{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 5}} and had a romance with her teammate [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]]. She would also later return to the Microverse to rescue a family who had been sent there by a new Inhuman's powers, confronting Gouzar again while there.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 20}} In addition to serving on the roster, she privately funded the team in order to avoid the problems that would come with government sponsorship.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 18.NOW}}

===AXIS===
Following the [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]] in which Avengers and X-Men alike joined forces to defeat the Red Skull, a magic spell cast by the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom inverted the moral axis of numerous heroes and villains. Wasp was one of the Avengers who became tyrants.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #4}} However, she was then captured by Captain America, who drained the Pym Particles from her body to use them to shrink and capture anyone who opposed him.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #5}}

The Wasp was later retrieved by Havok when the inverted X-Men stormed the Stark Tower. Alex tried to convince his brother to spare Wasp's life from a gene bomb the X-Men planned to detonate which would've killed every person on the Earth who wasn't a mutant.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #7}} After the bomb's detonation was prevented, Havok freed Wasp and tried to escape with her, claiming he was the one who defused the bomb. After realizing he hadn't done such thing, Janet turned on him and then rejoined the [[Axis (Avengers) (Earth-616)|Axis]] to prevent Steve Rogers from helping the inverted Red Skull reinvert the affected heroes and villains. When a reinversion spell was cast, Wasp became good once again. However, Havok didn't (as he had been accidentally shielded by Iron Man), and used her as a leverage to escape from the heroes.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #9}}

===The Ultron Agenda===
The Wasp was among the Avengers who confronted Ultron when the robot took control of the planetoid [[Titan (Moon of Saturn)|Titan]] and brought it next to Earth with the intention to infect the planet with transmuting spores that carried the [[Ultron Virus]]. During the clash, Hank Pym and Ultron became merged into a single being that fled in terror after realizing what he had become. Janet organized a funeral for Pym, whom the Avengers presumed dead.{{r|Avengers: Rage of Ultron Vol 1 1}}

Months afterwards, the merged Ultron returned to Earth, claiming Hank was in full control of the amalgam and intended to do good. The Wasp caught up with them, with the ulterior motive to analyse their conduct to corroborate if they were truly Hank Pym. Janet flunked them after Ultron's lack of knowledge on certain trivial matters raised several red flags. The Unity Division pressed Pym until his Ultron persona lashed out and they revealed their true intentions.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 10}} The Avengers believed to have dealt with Ultron after forcing him into a remotely-piloted [[Iron Man Armor Model 52|Hulkbuster Armor]] with direction to the [[Sun (Star)|Sun]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 12}} After this incident, Janet remained assisting the Unity Division,{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 15}} and eventually returned to its ranks full time{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 17}} until the team was dissolved along with several other teams of Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 690}}

In the interim, [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Edwin Jarvis]] had brought a young woman named [[Nadia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Nadia]] to the [[Van Dyne Estate]] in [[Southampton (New York)|Southampton]] to introduce her to Janet, as he believed she was the daughter of Hank and his first wife, Maria, who had escaped from the [[Black Widow Ops Program (Earth-616)|Red Room]] and was seeking asylum with family she'd never met.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 9|12}} After a meeting with [[Deborah Forrester (Earth-616)|Deborah Forrester]] at the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, Nadia and [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] assisted [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]] in taking down [[Monica Rappaccini (Earth-616)|Monica Rappaccini]], and although the Scientist Supreme escaped, Nadia gleefully spent time with Bobbi, whose work on [[Project Gladiator (Earth-616)|Project: Gladiator]] and adventures in the [[Savage Land]] had inspired her as a child. After mentioning that [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s list of most intelligent [[Homo sapiens|humans]] listed women no higher than 27th, Nadia was prompted to start [[Genius In action Research Labs (Earth-616)|G.I.R.L.]], an enterprise to assess the Earth's greatest female scientific minds and convince S.H.I.E.L.D. that their list was outdated and in need of revision.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 1}} Janet and Bobbi eventually took Nadia and the other young women under their wing, integrating G.I.R.L. into [[Pym Laboratories (Earth-616)|Pym Labs]] where they could better serve as mentors.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 8}}

When [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] became chairman of the reformed Avengers, he enlisted Wasp to become part of the team's support crew, the [[Agents of Wakanda (Earth-616)|Agents of Wakanda]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 12}} Around this time, Janet and Tony Stark acted on their latent romantic feelings for each other and began dating.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 4}} She helped Tony fight off the [[Raiders (Earth-616)|Raiders]],{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 6}} and the [[Basil Sandhurst (Earth-616)|Controller]].{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 7|11}} During one of her outings with Stark, Janet was kidnapped by an amalgamation of Vision and Wonder Man controlled by a returned Ultron,{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 15}} who intended to use a molecular fusion process on Wasp to merge her with Jocasta to become his new bride. Iron Man intervened with the help of [[Aaron Stack (Impostor) (Earth-616)|Machine Man]], and became fused to his armor.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 16}} Janet assisted Tony in unmerging from his suit when he used a process that required him to pilot a [[Iron Man Armor Model 58|Nano Iron Man Armor]] inside his body.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 18}} After Ultron was defeated, Tony came to think that he was an artificial duplicate of his real self, and broke up with Janet since he believed she deserved somebody who was an actual person.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 19}} After Tony sorted out his identity crisis, he and Janet semi-rekindled their relationship, leaving it in the open on where it might go in the future.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 6}} After Tony decided to return to his roots, Janet decided to formally break up with him, both agreeing that it was for the best.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 1}}

| Powers                  = '''Size Reduction:''' Due to long-term exposure to [[Pym Particles]], The Wasp could reduce herself in size, down to the dimensions of the insect from which she takes her name, roughly 1/2 inch in height. She usually chooses not to retain her standard density while at this reduced mass, but can choose to do so at will. The "lost" mass is shunted to a pocket dimension for later retrieval. Additionally, her strength was boosted while she is at reduced size, to the extent that she can bend a one-inch diameter steel bar almost double. Her size allows her to be easily unnoticed in most cases, allowing her to become stealthy in some cases.{{citation}}

'''[[Bio-Synthetic Wings]]:''' Due to small implanted insect wings, the Wasp could fly at incredibly fast speeds. These are functional when she reduced herself in height, and can remain so until reaching a height that is a nearly foot shorter than her normal height. Her flight speed can also allow her to gain a form of superhuman reflexes and agility, being able to easily evade targets and attacks.{{citation}}

'''[[Wasp's Sting]]:''' The Wasp could generate powerful bio-electric blasts from her hand that have been shown to be capable of cutting through high-density structures and is able to cause extreme pain to superhumanly strong and highly durable beings and can pierce their skin.{{citation}}

'''Insect Communication and Control:''' Through the use of her retractable antennae, the Wasp could communicate with and control certain higher insects, in a manner similar to [[Ant-Man's Helmet]]. She rarely chose to utilize this ability, however.{{citation}}

'''Size Addition:''' In addition to being able to shrink, Wasp can grow significantly in size as well.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 77|78}}{{r|Avengers Vol 3 80|81}}{{r|New Invaders Vol 1 0}}{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 8}} The growth process requires the rapid acquisition of bodily mass, presumably from an extra-dimensional source. This extra-dimensional mass should fortify all of her cellular tissues, including her bones and muscles, making it possible to support her increased weight, and giving her superhuman strength and durability.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 10; Dr. Henry Pym's entry}}

| Abilities               = '''Talented Fashion Designer:''' Janet was a very talented fashion designer. During her early days as the Wasp, she would constantly make new costumes for herself and wear different ones for almost every new mission. Over the years her talent earned her great acclaim in the fashion world. Janet's talents also extend to designing costumes for other superheroes; especially her Avengers teammates, including [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Firestar]] and [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]]. She possessed enough costumes of her own to fill either an entire closet or two.{{citation}}

'''Multilingual:''' Janet could speak fluent English, Spanish,{{r|Avengers Vol 3 29|30}}{{r|Unstoppable Wasp #7}} Hungarian,{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 15}} French and Italian.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://princelesscomic.tumblr.com/post/162664078636/janet-speaks-spanish|title=Janet speaks Spanish?|work=Tumblr|first=Jeremy|last=Whitley|date=6 July 2017|accessdate=21 May 2018}}}} She has also taught herself to speak the language of the [[Microverse]].{{r|Avengers Vol 4 31|34}}

'''Gifted Leader:''' While serving as Chairman of the Avengers, Janet proved herself to be a gifted and charismatic leader. She's also an astute diplomat and an avid student of public relations.{{citation}}

'''Gifted Amateur Screenwriter:''' Janet wrote a script, <i>The Coming of The Avengers</i>, which detailed her early adventures with Ant-Man and the formation of the original Avengers. Her screenplay so impressed representatives at the Titan Talent Agency, that they set up a meeting between her and Dino Domani, one of the most financially successful producers in Hollywood.{{r|West Coast Avengers Annual Vol 2 6}}

'''Expert Combatant:''' Janet had adapted to a special kind of hand-to-hand combat that was created by her ex-husband Hank Pym, which takes advantage of the fighter's insect size against a much larger form and physique enabling them to strike pressure points before the opponent even realizes what happened. She was also trained in multiple martial arts and unarmed combat fields by Captain America, making her into an adept combatant.{{citation}}
| Strength                = Janet has the strength of a normal human female of her age, height, and build who engages in moderate regular exercise. The Wasp's strength was boosted when she reduced in size, and increased geometrically when she chose to use her growing powers. At 10 feet tall, she could lift (press) 1,000 pounds, at 25 feet tall she could lift (press) 10 tons, and at 100 feet tall, she could lift (press) 50 tons. The higher she grew past 25 feet, the more of her strength she had to use simply to support her own enormous mass.{{citation}}
| Weaknesses              = 

| Equipment               = '''[[Wasp's Suit]]:''' At first Janet needed the suit to release the [[Pym Particles]] that allowed her to shrink but due to repeat exposure she was able to produce the particles herself. During her early days as the Wasp, she would constantly make new costumes for herself and wear different ones for almost every new mission. Even today, she changes costumes more often than most other superheroes.{{citation}}

| Notes                   = 
* According to [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]], there was a strong physical resemblance between Janet Van Dyne and [[Maria Trovaya (Earth-616)|Maria Trovaya]]; however, Janet was much younger than Maria.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} 
* During her first meeting with Henry Pym, Janet found him quite handsome. She quickly dismissed the possibility of a romantic relationship with him, because she considered him a dull, intellectual bookworm. Her ideal man (at the time) was an adventurer.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} 
* Henry Pym initially though Janet to be quite typical for a bored, society playgirl. With closer interaction between them, Pym discovered that she had both determination and strength of character.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} He was apparently not bothered that her main motivation was avenging her father's death, since his own motivation in becoming a hero was avenging his wife's death. They both took oaths of vengeance, before becoming Avengers.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
* When Janet initially informed [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]] that her father had been murdered and asked for his help, Henry hanged up the phone on her. He assumed that this was a prank call, and that Janet was lying to him. He only responded to her request for help, when [[Ant-Man's Ants]] confirmed that [[Vernon Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Vernon Van Dyne]] had been killed.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
* Janet supposedly chose Henry Pym as the first person to contact for help following Vernon's death, purely because her father considered Henry trustworthy, seemingly ignoring that the two men barely knew each other, and that they had met in person only once.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
*Janet loved her father, but never told him how much she appreciated him. In reaction to his death, she proclaimed that "there is one thing I can do...avenge him!".{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}} She also vowed to find out who had killed him, even if it took the rest of her life to do it.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
*During her first mission as the Wasp, Janet admitted that she was falling in love with Henry Pym. She wanted to tell him before either of them died in battle.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
*Henry Pym initially denied Janet's romantic affections, for two reasons. First, that Janet was much younger than him, and (in his view) still a child. Second, that he had already lost one loved one (Maria Trovaya), and never wanted to lose a second one. He was determined never to love anyone.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}
*While Ant-Man lectured the Wasp on how inappropriate her expressions on affection were, she did not believe a word. Janet was amused to notice that Ant-Man was blushing while speaking to her.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 44}}

| Trivia                  = 
* Wasp chose the name Avengers for the team.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 1}} The [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] also took his name from a description of him by the Wasp.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 57}}
* Wasp is a Protestant.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 105}}
