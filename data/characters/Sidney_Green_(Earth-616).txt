| History                 = Growing up in a number of orphanages and foster homes in [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]], Sidney Green was a boorish, clumsy child, often the target of cruel bullying by children and adults alike. An inveterate bed-wetter, Green carried around with him the funk of uncleanliness, which further ostracized him and made him miserable. Green's attempts to curb his nightly emissions by avoiding liquids led to dizziness and dehydration. Once his mutation manifested, a blissful drought beneath the waist set in, and there was a lack of sodden sheets. When Green joined Xavier's he was put in [[Chevaliers (Earth-616)|Gambit's Squad]]. As a student at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]], Green had regained some confidence, forwarding audacious advances to aesthetically stirring female student Foxx. When Foxx was exposed as [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], Green sensed betrayal and attacked her. Within days, Green was able to walk again. Yet, the experience of being smashed in the head with a flush-lavatory triggered unfortunate memories of his childhood, perhaps permanently traumatizing him.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #171|174}}
