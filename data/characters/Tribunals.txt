| HistoryText             = The Tribunals claimed to be a force dedicated to maintaining universal order. They monitored the activities of the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] for some months and, while pretending to be a secret government commission, conducted an enquiry into their activities, calling the Defenders' former foes the [[Mutant Force (Earth-616)|Mutant Force]], former Defenders associate [[Jack Norriss (Earth-616)|Jack Norriss]], and [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat's]] ex-husband [[Robert Baxter (Earth-616)|Buzz Baxter]] as witnesses.{{r|Defenders #87}}

Later, they used their agents the android [[Luann Bloom (Earth-616)|Luann Bloom]] and a mysterious [[Elf with a Gun]] to lure the four founding Defenders ([[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr Strange]], [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Prince Namor]], [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|The Hulk]], and [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|The Silver Surfer]]) to an extradimensional location where they convinced them that if they continued to band together as Defenders, a great catastrophe would occur.{{r|Defenders #122|125}}

The original Defenders duly disbanded, but Dr Strange later claimed that he had discovered the Tribunals was a "cosmic hoax". Their true nature and motives remain unclear.{{r|Incredible Hulk #370|371}}
