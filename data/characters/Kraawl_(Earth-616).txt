| History                 = The Kraawl acted as the mount for [[Kala (Earth-616)|Queen Kala]]. While the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] was searching for the [[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Mole Man]] in [[Subterranea]], he encountered Kala chanting to Kraawl. Thing mistakenly believed that Kraawl posed a threat to Kala and immediately attacked it. Kraawl withstood Thing's initial blow and coiled his long body around him. Thing got in two more blows, which finally knocked Kraawl out.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 127}}
