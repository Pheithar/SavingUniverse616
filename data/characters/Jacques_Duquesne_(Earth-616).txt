| History                 = Jacques Duquesne was a performer at various circuses and carnivals. His act demonstrated his mastery of knives, swords, and other bladed weapons. At one carnival he met a young [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Clint Barton]]. Seeing great potential in him, Swordsman and [[Buck Chisholm (Earth-616)|Trickshot]] trained the boy in blades and archery respectively, with Clint often being a secondary performer in the Swordsman's act.

Swordsman's gambling problem left him heavily in debt. One day the carnival paymaster was robbed, and Barton later found Swordsman with the money. Barton ran from him and climbed the high wire. Swordsman cut it by hurling his sword. Barton fell to the ground and the Swordsman left thinking he was dead. Barton survived and grew up to become [[Hawkeye]].{{r|Avengers #19}} (It is presumed that he and Barton reconciled years later.)

The Swordsman committed various crimes around the world, causing him to be barred from several nations. He sought out the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] thinking that posing as a hero would lead to much bigger crimes. His offer of service was refused. Angry, he attacked [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] but was soon surrounded.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 19}} The [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]] teleported Swordsman to his location, thinking he would make a useful double agent against [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]. He outfitted the Swordsman's sword with several embedded devices through Makluan technology. He also sent a faked message from Iron Man asking the Avengers to allow the Swordsman to join them. Although they suspected a trap, he was allowed to become a member.

Surprisingly, Swordsman fit in well and even developed a crush on the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]. Ordered by Mandarin to lure the Avengers to a bomb, he feared she would be injured and tried to dismantle it. When the other Avengers arrived, it looked like he had been caught setting the bomb instead.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 20}} Swordsman fled, and although he had regrets, he soon fell back into a pattern of crime. He served alongside a brainwashed [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] and [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Power Man]] on many occasions.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 29|30}}{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 88}}{{r|Avengers Vol 1 78|79}} He still longed to be a part of the Avengers and even joined them in Asgard to fight [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]] and the [[Amora (Earth-616)|Enchantress]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 100}} His heart was no longer in crime, and he began to drink heavily while serving Monsieur Khruul.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 121}}

The beautiful [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]] was also working for Khruul as a barmaid. She convinced him he could be a hero again. He was still reluctant until becoming injured on one of Khruul's assignments. Mantis helped him recover and the two left to the United States. Revitalized, Swordsman asked to rejoin the Avengers, and his sincerity won them over.{{r|Avengers #114}} Swordsman was a valuable member although he still doubted himself. He fell in love with Mantis but his feelings were not reciprocated by her. An angry Khruul captured Duquesne and tortured him on one occasion.{{r|Avengers #123}}

It was soon revealed Mantis was the Celestial Madonna. [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang]] began a mad quest to make her his bride. He was stopped by the Avengers and another version of himself, Rama-Tut. Kang decided that if he could not have Mantis, no one would and aimed a ray gun at her. Swordsman instinctively jumped in front of his love while Tut was able to grab the gun and alter his aim. The blast traveled up Swordman's sword, fatally wounding him. Mantis realized that she really loved Duquesne as he died.{{r|Giant-Size Avengers Vol 1 2}}

Swordman's body was buried in a garden maintained by the [[Priests of Pama (Earth-616)|Priests of Pama]] near where Mantis had grown up.{{r|Avengers #130}} This garden contained sentient plants known as the [[Cotati]]. It was actually the eldest 'tree' that was destined to mate with Mantis. It inhabited Swordsman's body and approached Mantis, explaining itself to her. [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]] married the two, then they seemingly transformed into energy and left Earth.{{r|Giant-Size Avengers #4}} It was later revealed that the spirits of Mantis and the Prime Cotati had actually left their human forms behind when their spirits left Earth to procreate and that the Priests of Pama had reburied the Swordsman's corpse in his original grave and had buried the body of Mantis, now in a state of suspended animation, beside him.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 39}} The Celestial Messiah was later born.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 4}}

Years later, Mantis approached the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]] seeking their help because she had no memory of what had happened to her since she first left Earth.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 37}} The search for answers soon led them to the temple of the Priests of Pama where the Swordsman's body burst up out of its grave, once again inhabited by the spirit of the Prime Cotati. After a fierce battle, the reanimated Swordsman killed Mantis and the shock of this death caused her consciousness to transfer from the plant-simulacrum body it had unknowingly been inhabiting and back into her original human body that was buried nearby. With her consciousness returned to her true form and her memories restored, Mantis dug her way out of her grave and revealed what had happened to her since she had left Earth. Having restored his former wife, the Prime Cotati vacated his host-form and, without its alien life-force to hold it together, the Swordsman's corpse disintegrated.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 39}}

The Swordsman was resurrected by the [[Chaos King]], and he fought the [[Eric Williams (Earth-616)|Grim Reaper]] alongside other dead Avengers, but he perished again in the end of the [[Chaos War]].{{r|Chaos War: Dead Avengers #3}}{{r|Chaos War #5}}{{r|Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide Vol 1 2}}
