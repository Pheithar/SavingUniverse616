| History                 = <center>''This is an abridged version of Stephen Strange's history. For a complete history see '''[[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)/Expanded History|Stephen Strange's Expanded History]]'''''</center>

===Early Life===
Stephen Strange was born to [[Eugene Strange (Earth-616)|Eugene]] and [[Beverly Strange (Earth-616)|Beverly Strange]] in November{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 176|'s cover}} 1930 while the couple was vacationing in [[Philadelphia (Pennsylvania)|Philadelphia]]. In 1932, Stephen's sister [[Donna Strange (Earth-616)|Donna]] was born at the family's [[Nebraska (State)|Nebraska]] farm. Knowing that Strange was destined to become the next Sorcerer Supreme, a resentful apprentice sorcerer, [[Karl Mordo (Earth-616)|Karl Mordo]], beset the child with demons from the age of eight through to adulthood, as he was jealous that a kid would be better than him. Ultimately Strange was rescued by Mordo's master, the [[Yao (Earth-616)|Ancient One]], mystic protector of the Earth-realm as the then-current Sorcerer Supreme. A year or two after this torment began, Stephen's brother, [[Victor Strange (Earth-616)|Victor]], was born. At age eleven, Strange aided an injured Donna, an experience which ultimately fostered an interest in medicine. At age fifteen, he briefly dated a young woman named [[Laura Robson (Earth-616)|Laura Robson]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 3 14}} Strange entered New York College as a pre-med student directly out of high school. Later, while home on vacation for his nineteenth birthday, Strange was swimming with Donna when she suffered a cramp. After a frantic search, Stephen found her already drowned. The experience left him with a sense of personal failure that eroded his medical idealism.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Vol 1 45}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3}}

===Medical Career===
[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) performs surgery in Doctor Strange Vol 1 169.jpg|left|thumb|Brilliant Surgeon]]
Stephen earned his medical degree in record time and entered a five-year residency at [[New York Hospital|New York-Presbyterian Hospital]], where his rapid success made him arrogant. Stephen's mother Beverly died near the end of his residency, and work became more and more impersonal for the bereaved surgeon. Strange's talent remained, however, and he became a wealthy and celebrated neurosurgeon before he turned thirty.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 115}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) from Strange Tales Vol 1 115.jpg|right|thumb|320px|Arrogant Doctor]]
Egotistical and greedy, cold and callous, Strange's interest in his patients generally began and ended at his bill.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 115}} The exception was [[Madeleine St. Germaine (Earth-616)|Madeleine Revell]], an injured [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] translator whom he saved and fell in love with. Following a whirlwind romance and proposal, she left him due to his increasingly materialistic nature.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 40}}

Two years after his mother's death, Strange's father, Eugene, also fell ill. Already crippled by grief over his mother's death (though he would never admit it), Stephen was unable to face any more tragedy and refused to visit Eugene's deathbed. A few days later, an outraged Victor confronted Stephen in his apartment over his apparent lack of grief.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Vol 1 45}} Following the confrontation, Victor rushed from the apartment and into the path of an oncoming car. Victor died, and a guilt-wracked Stephen placed Victor's body in cold storage, half-hoping that future breakthroughs could revive him.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Vol 1 10}}

===Car Accident===
[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) Accident.jpg|left|thumb|Car Accident]]
[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) from Strange Tales Vol 1 115 0001.jpg|right|thumb|Injured Hands]]
Around 1963, Strange was involved in a debilitating car accident.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 115}} [[Nicodemus West (Earth-616)|Dr. Nicodemus West]], a brilliant surgeon in his own right, was an admirer of Dr. Stephen Strange agreed to do the surgery. Though he was able to save Strange, the nerves in his hands were severely damaged.{{r|Doctor Strange: The Oath #2}} Dr.  Strange, with his surgical career over and too vain to accept positions as a consultant or assistant, soon exhausted his fortune following every rumored treatment, no matter how ineffective. In a matter of months, the once wealthy surgeon became a derelict,{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 115}} and resorted to performing a number of shady medical procedures to survive (and pay his growing bar tabs). Strange's guilt over the mistakes of his early life would come to weigh heavily upon him over the years, and his recollections of the time could not always be trusted.{{r|Doctor Strange: The Oath #2}}

===The Ancient One===
After hearing rumors of the mystical Ancient One, Strange pawned his last possessions for a ticket to the East. Strange found the Ancient One's Tibetan palace, but the aged sorcerer refused to cure him, instead offering to teach him in mysticism. Strange refused, but couldn't leave immediately due to a sudden blizzard. While staying for the duration of the storm, Strange witnessed the Ancient One's apprentice, Baron Mordo, secretly attack the teacher with mystically summoned skeletons, which the old man easily dispelled. Strange, his skepticism eroding, confronted Mordo about the treachery but Mordo responded with restraining spells that kept Strange from warning the Ancient One or attacking Mordo physically. Amazed by these displays of magic, Strange underwent a change of heart. Deciding that the only way to stop Mordo was to learn magic himself in order to challenge Mordo on his terms, Strange accepted the Ancient One's offer. Pleased by Strange's acceptance for unselfish reasons, the Ancient One removed the mystic restraints, explaining that he was well aware of Mordo's treachery but preferred to keep Mordo close by in order to control and possibly change him.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 115}} 
[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) from Excalibur Vol 3 13 0002.png|thumb|Doctor Stephen Strange]] 

The Ancient One had known of Strange and his potential to serve as the Sorcerer Supreme prior to even Strange’s first encounter with him. He regarded his hidden prowess so highly that he rejected [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]] for Strange as his pupil. The Ancient One had planned to make Dr. Strange his successor for a long time.{{Citation}} 

Strange spent years under the Ancient One's tutelage, learning to tap the innate mystic powers of himself and the world around him, as well as how to invoke the powers of Principalities, powerful beings such as [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]], [[Satannish (Earth-616)|Satannish]], and the [[Vishanti (Earth-616)|Vishanti]], who resided in their own mystic realms. A few years after Strange's arrival, Mordo left the Ancient One's palace to seek greater power. The two rivals would clash often in the future. It was during this time that Strange passed a test against [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]] itself. As a reward, Strange was given ageless life and an ankh-shaped mark on his forehead that would only appear when his life was in dire jeopardy. The Ancient One himself had attained near-immortality by passing this test over 600 years earlier.{{Citation}}

During his early years as a student of the mystic arts, Strange befriended many sorcerers around the world, including [[Julian Phyffe (Earth-616)|Lord Julian Phyffe]] and Sir Clive Bentley of [[Great Britain]];{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 114}} [[Alfeo Spinosa (Earth-616)|Cardinal Alfeo Spinosa]] and [[Tancredo Carezzi (Earth-616)|Count Tancredo Carezzi]] of [[Italy]]; [[Omar Karindu (Earth-616)|Omar Karindu]], [[Rama Kaliph (Earth-616)|Rama Kaliph]],{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 136}} and [[Turhan Barim (Earth-616)|Turhan Barim]] of the Middle East; [[Wai Chee Yee (Earth-616)|Wai Chee Yee]] and [[Sen-Yu (Earth-616)|Sen-Yu]] of [[Asia]];{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 136}} and [[Aleister Kane (Earth-616)|Aleister Kane]], [[Kenneth Ward (Earth-616)|Kenneth Ward]],{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 183}} and [[Frank Brukner (Earth-616)|Frank Brukner]] of [[United States of America|America]]. Strange also found allies among more of earth's heroes, aiding the [[Robert Paine (Earth-616)|Black Fox]] in at least two adventures, while other adventurers, such as [[Mortigan Goth (Earth-616)|Immortalis]] and [[Terror (Shreck) (Earth-88194)|Terror, Inc.]], regarded him with skepticism.{{Citation}}

===Mystic Consultant===
Strange studied magic under the Ancient One for seven years and returned to the United States in the 1970s. Strange became a mystic consultant, establishing his [[Sanctum Sanctorum|Sanctum Sanctorum]] in [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Greenwich Village]]. He was attended by [[Wong (Earth-616)|Wong]], latest in a centuries-old bloodline that had served the Ancient One, and who had become both Strange's servant and his friend. During this time Strange fought the demonic entities such as the [[Possessors]],{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 118}} [[Aggamon (Earth-616)|Aggamon]],{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 119}} the [[House of Shadows (Earth-616)|House of Shadows]],{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 120}} [[Zota of Pergamum (Earth-616)|Zota]],{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 124}} the [[Bottle Imp (Earth-616)|Bottle Imp]], and [[KhLΘG (Earth-616)|KhLΘG]]. Strange also fought the otherworldly [[Nightmare (Earth-616)|Nightmare]], who fed upon dreaming humanity's terror and became one of Strange's most bitter enemies.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 110}}{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 116}}{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 122}} The mysterious doctor's reputation grew, and Strange even became an occasional consultant to local and federal authorities.{{Citation}}

===Superhero Career===
When the debut of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] heralded the dawn of the Heroic Age, Strange initially remained aloof from New York's superhero community, fighting his battles against Nightmare and Baron Mordo{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 111}}{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 114}}{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 117}}{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 121}}{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 125}} in secrecy. At one point [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]], the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] god of trickery manipulated Strange into attacking his heroic foster brother, [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]. The treachery was soon exposed, however, and Strange turned against Loki.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 123}} Thor would later, in the guise of [[Donald Blake (Earth-616)|Dr. Donald Blake]] save Strange's life by operating on him after another battle with Mordo.{{r|Journey into Mystery #108}} Soon after, a clash with Mordo led Strange to ally with the young [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], who helped Strange rescue several people from a mystic dimension. The experience proved so traumatic that Spider-Man asked Strange to remove their memories of the event, though this caused them to forget Spider-Man's heroism as well. Impressed by the young hero's bravery and altruism, Strange came to regard him as a friend, and the two have teamed up many times over the years.{{Citation}}

[[File:Clea (Earth-616) and Stephen Strange (Earth-616) from Doctor Strange Sorcerer Supreme Vol 1 67 0001.jpg|thumb|Doctor Strange kissing [[Clea (Earth-616)|Clea]]]]
The Dread Dormammu, sensing his old adversary the Ancient One's declining power, threatened to invade the Earth-Realm and sent a messenger ahead of him. Upon learning of Dormammu's intent, the Ancient One sent Strange to the [[Dark Dimension]] to do battle with the evil foe. While there, Strange was approached by [[Clea (Earth-616)|Clea]], a novice mystic and, though few knew it at the time, daughter of Dormammu's sister [[Umar (Earth-616)|Umar]]. Clea feared that if Dormammu fell as ruler of the Dark Dimension, the dimensional barriers would weaken and the realm would be ravaged by the [[Mindless Ones]]. Clea thus sought to prevent the duel, but Strange would not yield.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 126}} Dormammu easily outmatched Strange, but in the process lost just enough of his energies that the Mindless Ones were able to invade. Seeking to save the Dark Dimension's denizens, Strange lent Dormammu enough power to create a new barrier. Enraged by his own weakness, Dormammu felt honor-bound to spare Strange, who in turn bargained with him to spare both the Earth-Realm and the attractive Clea.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 127}} The vengeful Dormammu never forgot the humiliation, however, and became one of Strange's most implacable enemies.{{Citation}}

Shortly after, Strange joined several superheroes in a battle against the powerful mutate [[David Lowell (Earth-616)|Sundown]]. Now more involved with the superhero community, he became a special consultant to prominent super-teams such as the Fantastic Four, the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. Months after attending the wedding of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed]] and [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Sue Richards]],{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #3}} Strange was reunited with his own love, Clea, who came to live with him in New York. 

Later, Strange was exiled to a hostile dimension by [[Charles Benton (Earth-616)|Asmodeus]], who took the doctor's form in an attempt to catch the Ancient One by surprise. Prevented from returning to the Earth-Realm by metaphysical law so long as Asmodeus occupied his form, Strange adopted a new form with a full-face mask (perhaps emulating his superhero allies). After defeating Asmodeus, Strange retained the new appearance to preserve his anonymity. After carelessly revealing his name during a battle with Nightmare, the cosmic [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]], whom Strange was aiding at the time, agreed to return Strange's anonymity by altering all relevant earthly documents and memories bearing the name “Stephen Strange” to “Stephen Sanders.” {{Citation}}

Strange next resisted the invading [[Undying Ones]], a race of demons that had once dominated the Earth, and were led by the infernal [[Nameless One (Undying Ones Leader) (Earth-616)|Nameless One]]. To face the onslaught, Strange manipulated [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Prince Namor]] of [[Atlantis]]{{r|Sub-Mariner #22}} and the monstrous [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] into aiding him.{{r|Incredible Hulk #126}} With the Undying Ones defeated, Strange seemed to believe the world safe from further incursion. Strange was troubled by his arrogant exploitation of Namor and the Hulk, however, and decided to forego magic and return to medicine as a consultant, selflessly performing the duties he once thought were beneath him.{{Citation}}

Strange's return to medicine lasted only a few weeks. After Baron Mordo tried to kill him, Strange returned to sorcery and defeated Mordo with the help of the Ancient One. The Ancient One, for reasons of his own, reversed Eternity's spell, restoring the name "Stephen Strange" to the world's records and memories. Shortly thereafter, the Nameless One returned and Strange donned his (non-masked) robes to confront the threat alongside Namor and the Hulk. Becoming friends despite their differences,{{r|Defenders #1}} the three were soon joined by the alien [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] to form the core of the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]],{{r|Defenders #3}} a loose-knit "non-team" that would reunite sporadically to meet threats against the Earth.{{Citation}}

[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) from New Avengers Illuminati Vol 2 1 001.jpg|thumb|A Captured Sorcerer]]
===The Illuminati===
{{Main|Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati}}
Following the [[Kree-Skrull War]], a number of Earth's most powerful heroes -- Doctor Strange, [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]], [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]], [[Iron Man (Anthony "Tony" Stark)|Iron Man]], Mister Fantastic, and Namor -- formed the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]], a secretive group of Earth's most influential heroes that would meet only a few times, and only to tackle events of extraordinary importance. While certain Illuminati members were unable to attend certain gatherings (such as Xavier and Iron Man), Strange attended all known meetings, adding the viewpoint and perspective his decades of battling mystic evil had brought him.{{r|New Avengers: Illuminati Vol 1|New Avengers: Illuminati Vol 2}}

The Illuminati inadvertently precipitated an invasion of Earth by the shapeshifting, alien [[Skrulls|Skrull]] race by attacking the homeworld after delivering a warning not to endanger their planet again. This led to their capture, experimentation, and analysis, which enabled the Skrulls to eventually perform enough reverse biological engineering and cloning to gather the resources required to launch a covert invasion.{{r|New Avengers: Illuminati Vol 2 1}}

===Sorcery Supremacy===
Strange came under attack by servants of the Old One [[Shuma-Gorath (Multiverse)|Shuma-Gorath]], a vast extra dimensional entity who had ruled on Earth millennia ago, but was banished in the Hyborian era. Shuma-Gorath sought to return to the mind of the Ancient One himself, and Strange entered his mentor's mind to confront the creature. After fighting a losing battle, the Ancient One himself asked Strange to slay him rather than allow Shuma-Gorath passage to Earth. The Ancient One's physical death made him one with Eternity, and Strange inherited the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme, guardian of the entire universe. Seeking solace from his new burdens, Strange attempted to use his power to revive his brother Victor using spells from the [[Book of the Vishanti]]; unfortunately, Strange did not realize he had read the [[Vampiric Verses]], imbuing Victor with the potential for resurrection as a vampire. Thinking the spells had failed, Strange left his brother's body in cold storage.{{Citation}}

Strange continued his adventures with the Defenders, and over the months the informal team's ranks included beings such as the Asgardian [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]], Brunnhilde,{{r|Defenders #4}} the winged millionaire [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]],{{r|Defenders #14}} the happy-go-lucky [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]],{{r|Defenders #46}} and others. Though this pitted Strange against less magical foes (such as the mutant [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], the alien [[Nebulon (Earth-616)|Nebulon]],{{r|Defenders #33|38}}{{r|Defenders Annual #1}} the subversive [[Sons of the Serpent (Earth-616)|Sons of the Serpent]], and the bizarre [[Headmen (Earth-616)|Headmen]]{{r|Defenders #31|35}}{{r|Defenders Annual #1}}), the camaraderie of the team and the love of Clea gave Strange a welcome change from his customary solitude.{{Citation}}

Later, however, Strange felt that his magical powers had become severely diminished. This allowed Strange to become possessed by the spirit of the [[Star of Capistan]], transforming him into the Red Rajah. As the Rajah, Strange tried to link the consciousnesses of all the people of New York City with his own to create a type of utopian society. Eventually, Strange's teammates in the Defenders were able to free him from the effects of the Star, which Strange promptly destroyed. As a result of this, Strange felt it necessary to take a leave from the Defenders in order to renew his commitment to the mystic arts in order to keep his powers at their peak.{{r|Defenders #42|46}} The Defenders continued on without him and later Strange would rejoin the group when they required his assistance.{{Citation}}

[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) from Marvel Masterpieces (Trading Cards) 1996 001.jpg|thumb]]
At one point, the trans-temporal sorcerers called the [[Creators (Earth-616)|Creators]] manipulated the Ancient One's spirit into offering Strange a chance to become one with the universe. When Strange rejected the offer he was stripped of the mantle and power of Sorcerer Supreme. Strange soon joined battle with the Creators, defeating their ally, the [[In-Betweener (Earth-616)|In-Betweener]], and thwarting their reality-reshaping plans. After their deception was revealed, the Ancient One restored Strange's title; who, if anyone, assumed the title in the meantime is unknown. Though Strange's adventure took mere days from his perspective, weeks passed on Earth.{{Citation}}

Months later, the mysterious alien [[Living Tribunal (Multiverse)|Tribunals]] perpetrated a hoax that convinced the four founding Defenders that their alliance would eventually cause a cosmic tragedy, and the group was disbanded. It would be some time before the hoax was exposed. Strange soon lent aid to [[Nightstalkers (Earth-616)|BorderLine Investigative Services]] (actually a band of vampire hunters) in confronting [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]]. At one point, Strange cast the [[Darkhold]]'s famed [[Montesi Formula]], a spell which destroyed all vampires within the Earth-Realm. The cryogenically stored body of Victor Strange, however, was passed over because it had been enchanted with the powers of the Book of the Vishanti. With the book ultimately being a tome of protection (even when applied to vampires), Victor's body survived. 

Meanwhile, in the Dark Dimension, Clea had returned to lead the rebellion against its current ruler Umar, whom she learned was her mother. Clea overthrew Umar and took the throne with Strange's help, but her responsibilities as ruler of the Dark Dimension and his as Sorcerer Supreme of the Earth-Realm meant the two would be forced to separate. Upon returning to Earth, however, Strange's role as Sorcerer Supreme was challenged by the covetous alien [[Urthona (Earth-616)|Urthona]]. At one point, the struggle against Urthona forced Strange to destroy his own collection of talismans, tomes, and artifacts to prevent Urthona from taking control of them. (It was later revealed that [[Agamotto (Earth-616)|Agamotto]], one of three Vishanti, had intervened, sequestering the collection away at the moment Strange seemed to destroy them).{{Citation}}

With the artifacts removed, the barriers between dimensions they had established weakened, and the Earth was assaulted by a number of once-pacified mystic threats. Strange met the threats with the extra dimensional novice mystic [[Rintrah (Earth-616)|Rintrah]], and was eventually joined by [[Kaluu (Earth-616)|Kaluu]], an old rival of the Ancient One and master of life-draining black magic. Weakened by the loss of his artifacts, Strange reluctantly accepted Kaluu's offer to teach him the black arts. These skills served Strange well when confronted with the return of Shuma-Gorath, whom Strange fought on one of his home planes. The power required to defeat Shuma-Gorath corrupted Strange, to the point where he merged with the evil demon-god. After inducing the merged creature to commit suicide, both Shuma-Gorath and Strange's own ego were destroyed. Kaluu guided Strange's spirit back to Earth, slowly restoring Strange's ego as he burnt off the taint of Shuma-Gorath's evil. Though this ultimately allowed the demon to reform in his home dimension, it had, at the very least, been prevented from returning to Earth.  Shortly thereafter, Strange returned to the Dark Dimension and married Clea, who came to live with him on Earth. Strange took Rintrah as his new apprentice, and an apparition of Agamotto restored Strange's seemingly lost collection. With the collection restored, Earth seemed to return to the status quo.

Strange assisted the X-Men (at the behest of fellow Illuminati member and longtime friend Professor X) when [[Margali Szardos (Earth-616)|Margali Szardos]], Sorceress Supreme and adoptive mother to [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], believed Wagner had been guilty of cold-blooded murder and thus magically separated his soul from his body into her own dimension. Strange determined that Nightcrawler was actually human, that a hostile yet not malevolent mystic force was responsible for his body's "death". Strange was taken along with the X-Men to Margali's realm of "Hell" where Kurt's innocence was proved and they were allowed to return to Earth on good terms. However, Strange was shocked when the [[Eye of Agamotto]] was used by Margali, who told him enigmatically that he had not been the Eye's first custodian, nor would he be the last, ending with Strange determined to find out more about the potent yet mysterious sorceress.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 4}}

It was at this point, however, that Victor Strange's body finally rose as a vampire, and ultimately fell under the sway of sorceress [[Marie Laveau (Earth-616)|Marie LaVeau]]. LaVeau tried to coerce Strange into again reciting the Vampiric Verses, thereby nullifying the Montesi Formula, but Strange instead banished the page containing the Vampiric Verses page from the Earth-Realm. Nonetheless, LaVeau was able to use Victor as a template to duplicate the spell, making it possible for long-destroyed vampires to reappear.{{Citation}}

===Infinity Gauntlet===
Strange and Clea were soon drawn back to the Dark Dimension, as both Dormammu and Umar sought to reclaim the throne. Umar ultimately won, leaving Clea exiled on Earth. While Clea sought allies to mount an offensive, Strange and others were drawn up in the fight with an [[Infinity Gauntlet]]-wielding [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] of [[Titan (Moon of Saturn)|Titan]]. The death-worshiping Thanos used the Gauntlet's immensely powerful [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Gems]] to eradicate half of the universe's population before the heroes defeated him and used the same power to undo the damage.{{Citation}}

===More Attempts at Title===
However, attempts to claim Strange's position of Sorcerer Supreme were not to end, even years after he had attained, lost and again won back his station. [[Ian McNee (Earth-616)|Ian McNee]] attempted to challenge Strange for the role, having trained himself for ten years, and apparently killed Strange; however, further killings due to others challenging McNee, in turn, convinced him that killing was the curse of the Sorcerer Supreme. However, Strange had not been killed and no one had really died from the battles. [[Nicodemus (Sorcerer) (Earth-616)|Nicodemus]], too, tried to seize Strange's title, winning it briefly, but the strain and pressure of such power and responsibility quickly overwhelmed him.{{Citation}}

===Midnight Sons===
Strange soon formed alliances with other supernatural heroes, manipulating the formation of the [[Midnight Sons (Earth-616)|Midnight Sons]], a loose group including his vampire hunter allies, as well as [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]], [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]], and [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Blaze]] among others. These warriors were actually the last in a long line of Midnight Sons, destined to confront the demonic scourges of [[Zarathos (Earth-616)|Zarathos]] and [[Lilith (Earth-616)|Lilith]]. He also briefly tutored the young sorcerer [[Augustyne Phyffe (Earth-616)|Augustyne Phyffe]], who ultimately chose to abandon sorcery.{{Citation}}

===Shanzar===
After sharing leadership of Earth's heroes against the [[Magus (Earth-7528)|Magus]] during the [[Infinity War]], Strange teamed with Namor, the Hulk, and the Silver Surfer to battle [[Shanzar (Earth-616)|Shanzar]], the invading Sorcerer Supreme of another dimension.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 371}}

===Recruited===
Meanwhile, the Principalities of various mystic realms began summoning their devotees to serve them in the [[War of the Seven Spheres]], a war between opposing magical entities expected to last five thousand years. When the Vishanti sought to enlist Strange, he refused, unwilling to abandon his earthly duties. Unable to resist them if called, Strange instead renounced the use of their powers, stripping him of much of his power.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Vol 1 48|49}}

===Secret Defenders===
Strange was then attacked by an even more powerful Dormammu, who had manipulated Clea into deposing of Umar so that he could again rule the Dark Dimension. With the help of the Hulk, the Silver Surfer, and Ghost Rider, Strange was able to repel the dark lord, but he continued to rule the Dark Dimension, and Clea remained there to again lead the resistance. Strange soon after began recruiting [[Secret Defenders (Earth-616)|Secret Defenders]], ad hoc teams assembled to meet periodic threats to the Earth that he could not handle alone. Strange also sought the aid of Immortalis in curing his brother Victor, but was refused because no permanent cure was known. After Rintrah was slain while destroying a dangerous talisman, Strange placed his body in stasis pending a potential revival, and took [[Kyllian Boddicker (Earth-616)|Kyllian Kell]], heir to ancient Celtic magic, as his new apprentice.{{Citation}}

[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 42 001.jpg|thumb|Larger than life!]]
===Infinity Crusade===
Strange was at one time abducted by the [[Goddess (Earth-616)|Goddess]], who collected thirty-three of the most "spiritually-attuned" heroes in the universe to aid her in her [[Infinity Crusade]], an attempt to purge the universe of evil. Mesmerized by the Goddess, Strange joined her crusade, and while his physical form served her, he sent his astral form to keep tabs on his brother. By this time Victor Strange had adopted the identity "Khiron", a costumed hero and deadly vigilante. After realizing how violent he had become, Khiron chose to take his own life. After breaking free of the Goddess, Strange again fought Urthona, who had grown even more powerful by serving in the [[War of the Seven Spheres]].{{Citation}}

===[[Siege of Darkness]]===
While tutoring his new, impatient apprentice, Kyllian was pulled into another dimension by a talisman. When Strange managed to find him, Kyllian refused to go; preferring to remain with [[Iskelior (Earth-616)|Iskelior]], a woman he met there. The bickering sorcerers were interrupted by the ancient sorceress Lilith, who began tearing down the mystical barrier to allow her demonic offspring, the [[Lilin]], passage to Earth. Kyllian remained behind to seal the dimensional tear, and Strange returned to Earth, promising to rescue Kyllian later.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Vol 1 58|59}} Joining the Midnight Sons, Strange confronted Lilith and her Lilin. At one point the Midnight Sons were menaced by a bloodlusting Morbius, while Wong's betrothed, [[Imei Chang (Earth-616)|Imei]], was dying from the poisoned kiss of the Lilin [[Sister Nil (Earth-616)|Sister Nil]]. Strange chose to subdue Morbius' bloodlust, saving the most people possible, but allowing Imei to die. Furious, Wong left Strange, and would even try to kill him on later occasions. Eventually, the Midnight Sons were victorious, and the Lilin were sealed back away in another dimension. In the meantime, Kyllian was rescued by [[Modred (Earth-616)|Modred the Mystic]], and returned to Earth in the form of Wildpride, now more in control of his "animal magick," and bearing a grudge against the master he felt abandoned him.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Vol 1 60|61}}

===Un-Earth===
Strange was later part of an international coalition of heroes opposing the techno-magical [[Mys-Tech (Earth-616)|Mys-Tech]], and was one of the six beings who stabilized the unraveling reality created by the clandestine group's "Un-Earth," a mystical replica they planned to use to control the real Earth.{{Citation}}

===Salome===
Strange again had to defend his tile as Sorcerer Supreme, this time from [[Salomé (Earth-616)|Salome]], a winged member of the mysterious [[Blood (Race)|Blood]] race and allegedly the first Earth-born Sorcerer Supreme over 20,000 years ago. Salome easily reclaimed the mantle from a weakened Strange, and began gathering followers to help her rule the Earth. Unable to stand against Salome, Strange secluded himself in a pocket dimension, taking Sister Nil (the last of the Lilin remaining in the Earth realm) to record his actions and act as his assistant. From that dimension, he dispatched two magical constructs based upon himself to tend to his earthly affairs. The first, [[Vincent Stevens (Earth-616)|Vincent Stevens]], became a cunning businessman, and built a fortune with which to develop so-called "technomagick." The other was a being called [[Paradox (Strange) (Earth-616)|Strange]], a masked figure who fought alongside the Midnight Sons and gathered artifacts for Strange to use against Salome. Strange also left the leadership of the Secret Defenders to [[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Doctor Druid]], another of the Ancient One's pupils. Though Doctor Druid served as best he could, he was ultimately unable to lead the group.{{Citation}}

Possessing only a few of his artifacts and mystically poisoned by Salome's dance, Dr. Strange realized that he would have to focus on developing his weakest discipline, elemental magic, in order to reclaim the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme. Dr. Strange had barely finished enhancing his sorcery when Stevens and Strange rebelled against him. Stevens was apparently destroyed in the resulting conflict, and Strange went to the Dark Dimension, where he merged with the rebellion's Nobel as Paradox. Meanwhile, Salome had enlisted Wong against his old master, claiming to have bound Imei's soul to the demon [[Xaos (Earth-616)|Xaos]], and promising a full resurrection in exchange for his service. Later, Strange would show Wong that Salome had been deceiving them and that Imei was truly dead. Wong gained some closure when Strange took him to visit her in the afterlife, and the two eventually reconciled. This time, however, Wong joined Strange as an equal partner, and in many ways a brother, not a servant. Wong still referred to Strange as "Master" from time to time because "old habits are hard to break."{{Citation}}
 
===War of the Seven Spheres===
After defeating Salome, Dr. Strange temporarily assumed a younger, more violent persona as he began to track down and terminate the illegal operations established by Stevens. Dr. Strange was still cleaning up after Stevens when he was again summoned by the Vishanti to served in the War of the Seven Spheres; unwilling to lose any more of his already diminished power, this time Strange complied. Although from his perspective Strange spent 5,000 years fighting for the Vishanti against their enemies, the [[Trinity of Ashes (Earth-616)|Trinity of Ashes]], only a few months passed on Earth by the time he returned. Strange's memories of the war were suppressed, and he returned to his more mature, bearded appearance. Exhausted from the war, Strange turned to the use of unpredictable Catastrophe Magic to increase his power. He later claimed to have supplemented it with so-called [[Glossary:Chaos Magic|Chaos Magic]], though still later he would claim that there was no such thing. In any event, Strange eventually regained the patronage of the Principalities, and his power was restored to their height.{{Citation}} 
 
===The Order===
The Dread Dormammu returned to attack Strange at this point, using the mutant [[Jonathon White (Earth-616)|Jonathon White]] and Strange's ally [[Topaz (Earth-616)|Topaz]] against him. Strange drove off his old foe and magically guided another surgeon to save Topaz from Dormammu's attack. Strange then faced the return of his old enemy [[Yandroth (Earth-616)|Yandroth]], the techno-mage. Strange, Namor, Hulk, and the Surfer united to oppose Yandroth's attacks on the Earth, but the four began to quarrel amongst themselves. Yandroth seemed to perish in the final conflict, and as a final curse, used Earth's magical energy to bind the Defenders together, forcing them to reunite against all future threats to Earth, regardless of their other concerns. Other former Defenders came to their aid at times, and though irked by the cause, was nonetheless touched to see the team reunited. The curse magnified the egos of the cursed quartet, however, until they became mentally unstable. They then became the Order, seeking to end all threats to the Earth by taking control of it. Other heroes, including Clea, fought them, and the energies unleashed by the battle were harnessed to resurrect and further empower Yandroth. Coming to their senses, the Defenders stopped fighting, and Yandroth was reduced back to his human form, defeated, and imprisoned.{{r|The Order Vol 1 1|6}}

Shaken by the ordeal, Strange cut himself off from the superhero community. Strange made the idealistic mystic Topaz his fifth known disciple but kept her at an emotional distance. When the power of the Kale family [[Tome of Zhered-Na]] unleashed the [[Andrew Kale (Earth-616)|Hellphyr]], a monster that attacked mystics, Topaz joined [[Jennifer Kale (Earth-616)|Jennifer Kale]] and [[Satana Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Satana]] in meeting the threat. She ultimately decided to leave Strange's side to join the other two in guarding the tome.{{r|Witches Vol 1 1|4}}

===Dead Girl===
Afterwards, Strange recruited the mutant [[Dead Girl (Moonbeam) (Earth-616)|Dead Girl]] to help him investigate the [[Pitiful One (Earth-616)|Pitiful One]]'s attempt to resurrect a number of hell-bound villains. During this time he came into conflict with the spirit of his old master, the Ancient One, who had apparently been relegated to a level of [[Hell]] for petty misuses of his power.<ref>However, later official information in the most recent edition of the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe indicates the possibility that this was an impostor, just like the Mockingbird in "Hell" was later found out to be another's soul.</ref> Strange was able to neutralize the threat, and was merciful to his old master. While Strange enjoyed a brief flirtation with Dead Girl, Wong grew concerned over the Doctor's health, particularly his failing memory.{{r|{{cl|X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl Vol 1 5|5]]}}

===House of M===
When the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] suffered a [[Avengers Disassembled|catastrophic mental break-down]] Doctor Strange used the Eye of Agamotto to stop her with a memory so terrible she collapsed from it, and ended the chaos she was inadvertently causing. The frail Wanda was taken to [[Genosha]] by her grieving father, Magneto. Desperate, Magneto enlisted the aid of his old friend and enemy, Professor Charles Xavier, to help his mentally unstable daughter. Xavier, in turn, summoned Doctor Strange. Even their combined efforts were not enough to help her. They attempted to mend her shattered psyche and minimize the damage done by her reality-altering powers, but were largely unsuccessful in their endeavor. Strange, having done all he could for Wanda, told the assembled Avengers and X-Men that together, he, Xavier and [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] could shield the heroes from Wanda’s power and went with the Avengers and X-Men to find Wanda. Due to the interference of her brother, [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], they failed, resulting in the warping of reality known as "the [[Earth-58163|House of M]]."{{r|House of M Vol 1 1}}

After Emma Frost and [[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|Layla Miller]] joined forces to unlock his memories, Strange went with the heroes to Genosha to force Wanda to put the world back. Wanda changed the world back to its original form, but in the process depowered 90% of the entire mutant population. Surviving mutants and ex-mutants referred to this as "M-Day: The worst day in mutant history." Strange was unable to break the successfully wrought spell or even find Wanda with his powers afterward. Later, a troubled Strange claimed that, as his job was to prevent something exactly like the House of M and its aftermath, he had "failed completely".{{r|House of M Vol 1 8}}

===Civil War===
In a meeting of the Illuminati, Strange vehemently opposed the proposed [[Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]], calling the actions it entailed "disgusting," and simply a means to give into people's fear and ignorance which would lead fellow heroes to fight to the death for their rights to oppose registration. He informed Iron Man and Mister Fantastic that they were never to call on him again before magically departing.{{r|New Avengers: Illuminati Vol 1 1}}

Sometime later, while having had friends on both sides of the war, Strange went into seclusion in the Arctic, fasting and meditating nonstop for forty days. As Sorcerer Supreme he could not take sides in the matter, for his given duties did not include influencing the evolution of the superhuman role in society, especially since there was no clear right or wrong. He prayed for an outcome that would benefit mankind and spill the least amount of blood.{{r|Civil War #3}} He later regretted his lack of involvement in the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]]. After the conclusion of the War, Strange was granted immunity to registration{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report #1|; Doctor Strange's entry}}{{Verify source}} as a "post-human exemption",{{r|Civil War Files #1|; Civil War Files}} yet the immunity did not extend to him openly breaking the Act with others.{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report #1|; Doctor Strange's entry}}

===New Avengers===
Following the Civil War, Doctor Strange housed the outlaw [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|renegade Avengers]] in his Sanctum Sanctorum, which had an illusion cast on it to appear abandoned and deteriorated.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 28}} He aided the team on their missions such as disabling the [[Mighty Avengers (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]] with mental illusions,{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 29}} teleporting them away from [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]] to the [[Keniuchio Harada (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]] while in [[Japan]],{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 27}} freeing [[Maya Lopez (Earth-616)|Maya Lopez]] from the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]]'s magic and defeating their ninja,{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 31}} saving their [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]]-virus infected plane,{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 32}} and casting a series of spells helping to calm the panicking people in Manhattan after being cured by Iron Man from a [[Venom Virus]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 36}}

When Spider-Man came to seek his magical expertise in healing [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|Aunt May]], Strange tried to help Peter Parker by using the Hands of Death to send him around the entire world to consult others, but told Peter that even his magic couldn't help May now, or at least he was unable to use it to help her.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Vol 1 24}} He also continued to fulfill his duties as Sorcerer Supreme, such as aiding the new roster of the Fantastic Four from preventing Eternity's death.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 550}}

===World War Hulk===
Dr. Strange was among the members of the Illuminati who, alarmed at the continuing destruction caused by the Hulk, agreed to exile the Hulk into space.{{r|New Avengers: Illuminati #1}} When the Hulk returned to Earth seeking vengeance, mistakenly believing them responsible for the explosion that killed millions on the planet [[Sakaar]], Strange declined Iron Man's request to use magic to again banish the Hulk, arguing the Hulk would simply return again. He instead offered Iron Man the aid of the New Avengers to evacuate and help defend New York, which Stark gladly accepted.{{r|World War Hulk #1}}

Strange entered the Hulk’s mind, reminding them of their history and friendship, as well as insisting the bomb was not planted by the Illuminati. Just as the Hulk reverted to his Bruce Banner form, and a sympathetic Strange presented himself in a physical form, Banner turned back into the Hulk and crushed Strange’s hands. Strange's crushed hands limited his magic abilities.{{Citation}}

Strange invoked the power of [[Zom (Earth-616)|Zom]] to battle the Hulk, drinking Zom's soul to become a semi-demonic version of himself with spiked maces for hands. However, the unfamiliar use of such vast dark magic weakened his control over his new powers, which caused Strange to almost kill civilians. The shaken Strange was overpowered by the Hulk, implanted with an [[Obedience Disk]], and forced to first fight a giant, tentacled monster in the [[Madison Square Garden]] with the rest of the fallen heroes. He was then forced to battle the other Illuminati members, facing off against [[Blackagar Boltagon (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] (actually a Skrull impostor) and attempted but failed to use what remained of his magic to stop him. The [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] arrived in time to save the Illuminati, and Strange was freed, though his mind, body, and soul were all evidently scarred by this incident.{{r|World War Hulk #3}}

===Secret Invasion===
The disturbed Iron Man, having received the [[Pagon (Earth-616)|Skrull Elektra]]'s corpse, summoned the other five Illuminati members to discuss the Skrull threat. The Illuminati were caught by surprise when the Black Bolt attending the meeting revealed himself to be a Skrull and attacked. Strange teleported the four of them out of there. The five Illuminati members then each went his own separate way, realizing that they had lost far more than just a world: they had lost their ability to trust. The Illuminati was essentially no more.{{r|New Avengers: Illuminati Vol 2 5}}

Before the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] was fully underway, Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum had been invaded by the crime syndicate of the super-villain the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]], prompting Strange to use of darker magic than normal. This lapse prompted him to temporarily depart this plane to heal himself and to reflect on his worthiness to be Earth's Sorcerer Supreme.{{r|New Avengers Annual #2}} Strange had lost both his mastery of the Mystic Arts and the Sanctum Sanctorum.{{r|New Avengers #51}}

Doctor Strange returned to Greenwich Village once more to combat a stampede from the [[Dream Realm]], though he himself admitted he was in no shape to do battle with the beasts unleashed, due to his hands still being broken and his mystical energies at an all-time low. Daimon Hellstrom used hellfire to destroy Nightmare’s beasts.{{r|Last Defenders #3}}

[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) and Zom (Earth-616) from New Avengers Annual Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|300px|Doctor Strange: Fallen]]
===Dark Reign===
A Doctor Strange from an earlier time period appeared (wearing the dark masked costume he had worn long ago to conceal his identity) with the other three original Defenders to engage his longtime rival Mordo, allied with [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax]], [[Todd Arliss (Earth-616)|Tiger Shark]], and [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]]. Two of the [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elders of the Universe]], the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] and the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]] had made a bet involving the teams of the original Defenders, for the Grandmaster, clashing with the newly formed team of '''[[Offenders (Earth-616)|Offenders]]''', for the Collector. Strange had to work with his allies to fend off the sinister foursome if he was to the save the life of Clea. Though Strange was eventually slain by the Red Hulk, [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] defeated the Red Hulk and the Collector decided to undo the deaths brought about.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 10}}

Doctor Strange was met by Thor, who told him of his need to heal [[Mjolnir]]. Strange summoned magics to pass through Thor, carrying away the Odinpower from him, and deposited it in Mjolnir. When it was done, the hammer was whole once more.{{r|Thor #602}}

Strange contacted [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] to find out if he was the one destined to be the next Sorcerer Supreme. He offered to make Wiccan his apprentice. After the Hood's demonic form approached them, Strange confronted Parker. The Hood was acting on the orders of the Dread Dormammu to slay Strange, and thus claim Strange's former role of Sorcerer Supreme. Dormammu had bestowed upon him the ability to locate Strange if Strange utilized magic. Strange teleported himself and Wiccan away reaching the New Avengers and pleading for their aid.{{r|New Avengers #51}}

[[File:LostSS.jpg‎|thumb|300px|Ex-Master of the Mystic Arts]]

Strange and the New Avengers joined forces to combat the Hood and Dormammu. They followed the Eye of Agamotto to [[New Orleans]] to contact Daimon Hellstrom before the Hood could destroy him to prevent him from possibly rising to Strange's lost role. They struggled against the might of Dormammu, until [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Brother Voodoo]], having been granted the power and gifts of the office of Sorcerer Supreme by the Eye of Agamotto and the Ancient One's spirit, intervened and confronted Dormammu himself, passing the initiation and dispelling him.{{r|New Avengers #53|55}} Though Strange did not escape the battle entirely unscathed, he retained the power to manipulate magic (though to a far lesser extent) while he was apparently redeemed in his own eyes somewhat to observe the new Doctor Voodoo battle supernatural menaces.{{Citation}}

===Heroic Age===
When Agamotto was cast out of the Vishanti and had most of his powers stripped from him, he attacked the New Avengers in order to reclaim the Eye of Agamotto from Doctor Voodoo as it was the only artifact that could defeat him. Jericho used the Eye to defeat Agamotto, but the Eye was destroyed and his life was lost in the process. Doctor Strange rejoined the New Avengers. He remained with them through the events of ''[[Fear Itself]]'' and the return of [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]]. He stood with the Avengers against the X-Men when the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] returned to Earth, serving ably even without the full array of powers he had previously commanded.{{Citation}}
 
[[Daniel Drumm (Earth-616)|Daniel Drumm]], who had vowed revenge on Strange for the death of his brother, attacked the New Avengers shortly after ''Avengers vs. X-Men'', when the team was distracted by [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]]'s announcement that he and his wife were stepping down. Drumm used his abilities to possess others to sow chaos, implicating Strange in the murders of [[Victoria Hand (Earth-616)|Victoria Hand]] and Daimon Hellstrom. He eventually possessed the Avengers and New Avengers, using their abilities in his attempt to kill Strange. Stephen had to appeal to dark magic to defeat Drumm and save his friends. Afterward, the Ancient One appeared on the battlefield and commended Strange for saving the others without harming them, for using dark magic without losing control, and for continuing to act as hero and defender of the world. He restored Strange to his former position as Sorcerer Supreme and gave him the artifacts of the office, the Eye of Agamotto and the [[Cloak of Levitation]], once again.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 34}}

===Incursions===
Shortly after becoming Sorcerer Supreme again, Strange was called upon for a meeting of the Illuminati once again. The [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] had experienced an event known as an "incursion" in which two universes collide with each other with each universes Earth as the point of impact, and had called on the Illuminati to try and find a solution to the problem.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 1}} Another incursion followed shortly after, and the Illuminati decided to assemble the [[Infinity Gauntlet]] to stop it, and Stephen supplied his gem. Captain America wielded the Gauntlet and managed to avert the incursion, but the Gauntlet was destroyed in the process. Due to his unwillingness to do whatever it took to stop the incursions, such as considering the destruction of another world to save their own, [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] was voted out of the Illuminati and Stephen erased his memories of it.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 3}}

[[File:Original Sin Vol 1 3 Dell'Otto Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
===[[Infinity (Event)|Infinity]]===
When Thanos sent off his [[Black Order (Earth-616)|Cull Obsidian]] to Earth to target each of the Illuminati's members, [[Ebony Maw (Earth-616)|Ebony Maw]] approached Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum to find what his leader sought.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 8}} Ebony Maw was able to influence Doctor Strange into telling him what he wanted.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 9}} The villain also used the Doctor to launch an attack on New York, forcing him to summon Shuma-Gorath from the ground.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 2}}

When each member of the Illuminati dispersed and searched for Thanos' [[Thane (Earth-616)|Inhuman son]] it was the Doctor who found him. However, Maw wiped Strange's mind of his findings and kept his location to himself.{{r|Infinity #3}} The search was interrupted by another incursion and Strange and the rest of the Illuminati traveled to the other universe, where they encountered the [[Builders (Race)|Builders]] of that universe, who revealed to Stephen and the Illuminati that his memories and mind had been manipulated. Upon returning, Stephen joined the Illuminati in liberating their headquarters at the [[Necropolis]] from Thanos' forces.{{r|Infinity #6}}

===Post-Infinity===
Tired of watching others make choices while he did nothing, Dr. Strange resolved to use the full resources at his disposal as Sorcerer Supreme to find a way to stop the Incursions. Calling on the power of a tome of the darkest of black magics; the Blood Bible, Stephen traveled to the [[Sinner's Market]] in the mystic dimension, the [[Lost Lands]], on a quest to find power. He was led to the [[Resolute Throne]], where he sought to make a deal. The Throne deals in degrees of godhood, with a fifth of a man's soul buying him a fifth of the power of a god. There, Stephen made a deal to sell the entirety of his soul.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 14}}

===[[Time Runs Out]]===
Shortly after the actions of the Illuminati were made public, Stephen Strange left [[Earth-616]] and joined the cause of the [[Black Priests (Multiverse)|Black Priests]], having mastered the way in which they manifest their power to distort reality. He and the other Black Priests were encountered by [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|Sunspot's Avengers]] in their way to find the responsible for the decay of the [[Multiverse]], and offered their help to defeat either of the two main players in this "Game of Worlds": Rabum Alal or the Ivory Kings.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 27}}

While the Multiversal Avengers went to confront the Ivory Kings, Strange went to [[Earth-1903990]] with the Black Priests to utilize a [[Great Key]] that activated a doorway to gain access to the [[Library of Worlds]] to defeat Rabum Alal. They explored the Library of Worlds and encountered a [[Black Swans (Multiverse)|Black Swan]]. The Swans were able to set a trap and destroy most of the Black Priests, with the exception of Doctor Strange, who was able to defend himself but was ultimately incapacitated. He was then brought before Rabum Alal, who was revealed to be [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] of Earth-616.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 31}}

Doom informed Strange of his origins as Rabum Alal and revealed his ultimate plan to defeat them: the different Molecule Men he had captured. In a last-ditch attempt to save the Multiverse, Doom took Strange and the Molecule Men to confront the Beyonders.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 33}} He was able to destroy them and harness all of their power using the regular Molecule Man as a conduit.{{r|Secret Wars #5}} However, Doom's accomplishment cost the death of thousands of universes, leaving only a dozen.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 33}}

===Secret Wars===
When the Multiverse finally perished in the final incursion between [[Earth-616]] and [[Earth-1610]],{{r|Secret Wars #1}} Doom used the power of the Beyonders to salvage the remains of several realities and build a patchwork planet named [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]], which was ruled under his iron fist, with the help of Doctor Strange, who became Battleworld's sheriff and Doom's right hand, usually acting as Doom's voice in certain matters.{{r|Secret Wars #3}}

[[File:Victor von Doom (Earth-616) from Secret Wars Vol 1 4 cover.jpg|thumb|250px|Sheriff Strange to the left of God Emperor Doom]]
As eight years went by, Doom and Strange managed to twist the memories of their inhabitants, to the point they would no longer remember what had existed before Battleworld. Stephen created his own base, the [[Isle of Agamotto]], a place of remembrance of his lost world. Five years after the creation of Battleworld, Strange found a vessel of unknown origin and kept it in the Isle, fearing something of great consequence was inside it, but not knowing it was the bodies of the few other survivors of Earth-616 in stasis.{{r|Secret Wars #3}}

With the appearance of a similar vessel from which the survivors of [[Earth-1610]] came out,{{r|Secret Wars #2}} Strange directed his attention towards the one he kept on his own. Once he opened it, he freed the survivors, among which were Mr. Fantastic and Black Panther. After explaining to the fellow survivors what had transpired while they were in stasis,{{r|Secret Wars #3}} Strange was summoned to a battle between the villainous survivors from Earth-1610 and the [[Thor Corps (Earth-15513)|Thor Corps]], Battleworld's police force. Doom remained unwilling to take part of the conflict until he saw Mr. Fantastic in the scene, he immediately teleported to Utopolis, and stopped the fray, demanding the newcomers to recognize his authority. To prevent Doom from prejudicially acting upon the interlopers, Stephen used his magic to teleport them away. Following the disappearance of the villains from Earth-1610 and the heroes from Earth-616, Doom confronted Strange for disobeying him and ultimately killed him after Stephen accused him of being afraid of Richards.{{r|Secret Wars #4}}

===Last Days of Magic===
Following Doom's fall during which Mr. Fantastic acquired his power and rebuilt the Multiverse, Reed resurrected Doctor Strange, with his memories of Battleworld erased.{{r|All-New, All-Different Marvel Universe #1}} With a new lease on life, Strange continued protecting the normal world from magical threats. He would soon find himself challenged by the biggest threat to magic yet, the [[Empirikul (Earth-616)|Empirikul]], worshippers of science led by the [[Imperator (Earth-616)|Imperator]], a being from another dimension hellbent on destroying magic throughout the different planes of existence of the universe.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 1}} The effects of the Empirikul's crusade, which consisted of killing Sorcerers Supremes and destroying magic energies, was felt in Strange's dimension in the form of failing spells or magical creatures acting strangely.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 3}}

[[File:Doctor Strange Vol 4 20 Mora Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Strange, Zelma and Wong]]
The Empirikul eventually arrived at the [[Earth]], attacking several magical landmarks and defeating magic users.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 5}} Strange himself was defeated, even after channeling all of Earth's magic in an attempt to subdue the Imperator, as a consequence of this, the Earth was depleted of most of its magic.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 6}} Only the intervention of old sorcerer [[Monako (Earth-616)|Monako]] allowed Strange and his colleagues to escape from being burned alive in the front of the Sanctum Sanctorum.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 7}}

After traveling around the globe finding objects that contained the last traces of magic, Strange and the other magic users, including the Scarlet Witch, [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]], and Doctor Voodoo,{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 8}} Strange returned to the Sanctum Sanctorum, which was still being raided by the Empirikul, to defeat the Imperator.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 10}} Strange joined forces with the [[Mister Misery (Earth-616)|Thing in the Cellar]], a magical creature who was created from all of the pain Stephen suffered when using magic, and managed to defeat the inquisitors.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 10}}

During this time, Strange met [[Zelma Stanton (Earth-616)|Zelma Stanton]], who was around for the entire battle against the Empirikul, and afterwards became Strange's librarian.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 1|10}}{{r|Doctor Strange Annual Vol 2 1}}

Magic eventually started to rekindle, and Doctor Strange began re-creating spells with the help of the Zelma{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 11}} and began repairing destroyed Sanctum Sanctorum with the help of Wong. During this time, Strange had a day-long encounter with his ex-lover [[Clea (Earth-616)|Clea]], who wanted an official magical divorce,{{r|Doctor Strange Annual Vol 2 1}} and he helped [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|the Punisher]] defeat a crackpot menace who was trying to use magical artifacts to cleanse New York City of foreigners by summoning a giant demonic leviathan.{{r|Doctor Strange / Punisher: Magic Bullets Infinite Comic Vol 1 1|8}}

===Loki: Sorcerer Supreme===
Believing that Strange wasn't ready for the looming threats that were going to endanger the Earth, [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]] targeted Stephen with the objective to prepare him. To this end, he tricked Strange with an elaborate illusion in which the Vishanti bequeathed the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme to the God of Mischief.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 385}} Stephen handed over to Loki all of his magical possessions, including the Sanctum Sanctorum. With his medical license revoked since he had stopped practising, Stephen opted to open a veterinary clinic.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 381}} He also acquired a talking basset hound called [[Bats (Earth-616)|'Bats']].{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 382}}

[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) and Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616) from Doctor Strange Vol 1 384 001.jpg|thumb|right|Void possesses Doctor Strange]]
Strange decided to soon oppose Loki after learning his successor was searching for a powerful spell called the Exile of Singhsoon, which Stephen had hidden inside Zelma's soul for safekeeping from anyone, including himself. After a confrontation with Loki resulted in Bats' accidental death, Strange decided to make preparations to for his second fight with Loki.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 382}} With the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]]'s help, Strange gained power from [[Yggdrasill]],{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 383}} and used it to best Loki. However, Zelma cast a spell that canceled out all forms of magic for a few minutes in an attempt to have them reach a middle ground, but Loki used his natural godly superhuman strength to knock Strange out. Strange turned the tables when he unleashed the [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|Void]] from the depths of the Sanctum Sanctorum.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 384}}

While possessing Stephen's body, the Void revealed the location of the Exile of Singhsoon. Loki excised it from Zelma and used it to consolidate all of Earth's striving magic into himself. He first separated Stephen from the Void, and then used the power boost to jump-start magic itself all over Earth, so to provide a temporary fix to the Empirikul's ravaging, his true objective behind his search for the spell. Strange and Loki joined forces, and locked the Void back into the Sanctorum. When the dust settled, Loki saw himself forced to reveal his ploy regarding the Vishanti's illusion and the passing of mantle. After disclosing his intentions behind the ploy, Loki relinquished his role as Sorcerer Supreme back to Strange. Before being teleported away, Loki apologized for Bats' death, revealing he had returned the hound as a spectre.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 385}}

===[[Damnation]]===
After [[Las Vegas]] was eradicated by the [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier|Helicarrier]]s during the [[Secret Empire (Event)|Hydra takeover]], Doctor Strange used his reclaimed magic to resurrect the people who had died. However, Mephisto opposed Strange, since he had already claimed the souls of those people. Mephisto then orchestrated the events which causes his demons to bring Strange into his "[[Hotel Inferno]]". After Mephisto claimed the last remnants of Las Vegas, before its restoration, and the Hotel started to affect the people, including [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]], [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]], [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], and [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Thor]], who were turned into [[Ghost Rider]]-like creatures. Doctor Strange then fought Mephisto in a game of blackjack, in which if Strange won Mephisto would release the souls of those people and return them to Las Vegas, or if Mephisto won he would claim Strange's soul. Doctor Strange won, however by cheating, which was discovered by Mephisto and had Strange tortured.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 386}} Wong was then contacted by the ghost of Strange's dead dog [[Bats (Earth-616)|Bats]], who told him to help Doctor Strange, and Wong in return then summoned [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]], Doctor Voodoo, [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]], Johnny Blaze, Iron Fist and [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]] who then reformed the [[Midnight Sons (Earth-616)|Midnight Sons]].{{r|Doctor Strange: Damnation Vol 1 1}} After Wong and Bat's ghost were separated from the Midnight Sons, they were then confronted by Doctor Strange's body now turned Ghost Rider, but Bat's ghost was able to possess Strange's body.{{r|Doctor Strange: Damnation Vol 1 2|3}} 

Doctor Strange was then rescued by Scarlet Witch, Clea and Loki and assisted him in helping the Avengers fighting the demons. However, it was revealed to be all an illusion and that Clea was actually Captain Marvel posing as her in order to trick Strange. Thankfully, Strange's soul reunited his dog's ghost in the [[Realm Between]] along with Dormammu and the souls claimed by Mephisto, while he used their bodies. Strange then met the souls of the Avengers and managed to return their souls to their bodies.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 387|389}} He then assisted the Avengers and the Midnight Sons in fighting Mephisto and preventing him from returning to his throne, which claimed by Johnny. Doctor Strange was able to defeat Mephisto, but the demon went anyway to his realm and was again defeated by the different Ghost Riders and sent him back to Earth where he was trapped at the top of the hotel. Then Strange and the other heroes left the now normal Las Vegas, while Wong remained in order to keep Mephisto at bay.{{r|Doctor Strange: Damnation Vol 1 4}}

===[[Sorcerer Supreme of the Galaxy]]===
At some point, after an encounter with an Elder God [[X'axal]], Strange began experiencing a magical withdrawal. This ultimately resulted in a complete burnout, rendering Stephen unable to tap into the Earth's magic supply. After a meeting with [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]], Strange took to the stars in search for alternative sources of arcane powers.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 5 1}} Early in his journey, he became a prisoner on the planet [[Grynda]], where he met a young arcanologist called [[Pkzkrfmknna (Earth-616)|Kanna]] and the two decided to roam the galaxy together after folding the Gryndans invasion plans.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 5 2}} Eventually, the two landed on [[Tarnax II]] where they've encountered the [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]] experimenting on the newly-restored [[Time Stone]]. Strange took the Stone from the Skrulls and concealed it from Kanna, using a memory-wipe spell.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 5 3}}

[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) from Doctor Strange Vol 5 5 001.png|thumb|left|Strange's new garb]]

During their journey, Strange and Kanna came into conflict with the [[Majesdanians]], as they tried to save a dwarf from [[Nidavellir]] named [[Eoffren (Earth-616)|Eoffren]]. At this point, Strange had recovered his connection to magic enough to summon the Cloak of Levitation back to his side. The rescue resulted in Kanna becoming the Majesdanian prisoner, as they were preparing to invade the Earth. To save her, Eoffren gifted Strange his own [[Mystic Forge]] and taught him the art of mystic craftsmanship. With a new suit and a new weapon, the Scalpel of Strange, Stephen teleported onto the Majesdanian ship, quickly dispatching of the crew and freeing Kanna. The two later stopped the launched Majesdanian missile from reaching Earth, by conjuring a colossal seal of the Vishanti to shield the planet.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 5 4}}

===[[The Two Doctors]]===
After successfully stopping the Majesdanian invasion, Strange and Kanna returned to Bleecker Street, where they encountered another Stephen Strange. In the ensuing battle it was revealed that the Strange that remained on Earth was a disguised [[Casey Kinmont (Earth-616)|Casey Kinmont]].{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 5 5}}

===[[Death of Doctor Strange]]===
One day, Strange responded to a knock at his door late at night. It was an unrevealed person Strange apparently knew who then attacked him and killed him with a dagger. Strange's body was later found by Zelda Stanton, Wong, and Doctor Voodoo. Baron Zemo also appeared and complained that someone robbed him of the chance to kill Strange. When extradimensional threats began overwhelming Earth due to Strange no longer maintaining a magical barrier that kept them at bay, a [[Stephen Strange (Simulacrum) (Earth-616)|simulacrum]] Strange created in case something happened to him appeared and asked what year it was.{{r|Death of Doctor Strange Vol 1 1}}

[[Image:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) from Witches Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|Doctor Strange unleashing the might of his mystic forces]]
'''[[Sorcerer Supreme|Sorcerer]]:''' Dr. Strange possesses a vast mastery of the mystic arts; his primary magical patrons are a group of entities known as "the Vishanti." The [[Vishanti]] are a trinity of godly beings comprised of [[Agamotto (Earth-616)|Agamotto]], [[Hoggoth (Earth-616)|Hoggoth]], and [[Oshtur (Earth-616)|Oshtur]]. Although he has, on rare occasions, called upon the power of demons such as [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]]; Strange more frequently did so before he realized Dormammu's true dark nature in the earlier issues. He has once stated that he can kill a mortal with the mere twitch of a finger.{{Citation}}
*'''[[Immortality|Infinite Longevity/Fearlessness]]:''' Dr. Strange's lifespan has been extended and his fear of dying subsided in a manner similar to that of his mentor the [[Ancient One (Earth-616)|Ancient One]], due to a successful contest against [[Death]]. Though he can still be killed and even physically wounded, he cannot succumb to any medical diseases, nor does he age. However, he still requires food, water, oxygen, and sleep, the same as a normal human. Strange passed a test by the Ancient One and defeated Death, or more accurately, accepted Death.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 4}} As a result, from that moment forward, Doc stopped aging. "Death may come only from without, in battle-- and not from within." The Ancient One had once passed the same test himself and lived 600 years. From that moment forward, a glowing ankh appears on Doc's forehead when he is in a situation of great danger and his death is imminent, "when Strange most needs a reaffirmation of life."{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Vol 1 45}}
*'''[[Energy Blasts]]''':{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 19}}{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 386}}{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 387}} Capable of destroying moons and planets
*'''[[Mystic Bolts]]'''{{Citation}}: 
*'''[[Astral Projection]]:''' Doctor Strange can release his astral form from his body, instantaneously and at will. In this form he does not need to breathe, eat, drink or sleep, is unrestricted by physical laws (for example, Strange has flown beyond Earth’s atmosphere, defying gravity with ease to speak with Iron Man), is invisible (though can be seen by any if he wished it so), intangible, and incapable of being harmed by all but the most powerful and rigorous of mystic means. As physical laws are meaningless on the astral plane, Strange is able to use it to traverse at virtually any speed desirable (Strange has reached to St. Louis, Missouri from his Sanctum Sanctorum in Greenwich Village, New York in "a few brief seconds" thus,{{r|Giant-Size Defenders #2}} as well as traveling at the "speed of thought" through outer space.{{r|Defenders #29}})
*'''[[Glossary:M#Magic|Banishment]]:''' Dr. Strange has banished many types of creatures and humans to other dimensions, but the extent of this is only possible as long as the 'Banish-ers' magic is greater than that of the 'Banish-ees' magic during the banishment.{{Citation}}
*'''[[Glossary:M#Magic|Conjuring of Objects]]'''{{Citation}}
*'''Transmutation:''' Dr. Strange has showcased the ability to molecularly alter and convert an object into another of his choosing using spells.'{{Citation}}
*'''[[Telepathy]]:''' Dr. Strange can psychically communicate and read minds These abilities can be amplified by mystic energy (as against [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]]) and/or the Eye of Agamotto (done countless times) to afford Stephen incredibly powerful psychic abilities.{{r|Infinity Abyss Vol 1 3}} He has been able to telepathically overpower Scarlet Witch and trap Sentry in an illusion
*'''[[Telekinesis]]:''' Dr. Strange can mentally manipulate his environment through the use of psionics without physically interacting with it. However, it is much more common for Strange to rely on magical manipulation rather than psionic.{{Citation}}
*'''[[Flight]]:''' Doctor Strange can fly using magical energy but has since abandoned it. (Presumably choosing to rely on the Cape of Levitation instead.) {{Citation}}
*'''[[Protective Shields]]:''' Using the being [[Seraphim]], Dr. Strange can shield himself or his allies. Doctor Strange is so powerful that his energy shields can even protect him from the full power of a supernova (which he created),{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 27}} as well as planetary destruction
*'''[[Hypnotism]]'''{{Citation}}
*'''[[Illusions]]:''' Dr. Strange has the ability to magically create illusions and cause others to experience things that aren't real, using spells to do so.{{Citation}}
*'''[[Intangibility]]:''' Dr. Strange has the ability to become invisible or near-invisible and phase through solid material.{{Citation}}
*'''[[Time Manipulation]]:''' Strange has frozen, slowed, and traveled through time. This magic is enacted only through extreme concentration.{{r|Incredible Hulks Vol 1 635}}
*'''Elemental Manipulation:''' Dr. Strange can manipulate and control the elemental forces.{{Citation}}
*'''[[Teleportation]]:''' Dr. Strange can teleport himself and others to any place of his choosing through the use of magic. It is also stated he can move at the "speed of thought" through his astral form.{{Citation}}
*'''[[Dimensional Travel]]:''' In addition to his ability to teleport across a single plane, Dr. Strange has also showcased the ability to travel between dimensional planes and access alternate dimensions. For example, he was able to willingly travel to the Dark Dimension. {{Citation}}
*'''[[Universal Awareness]]:''' By performing meditation, Dr. Strange has sensed anomalies in time and space, allowing him to protect against time travelers, extra-dimensional invaders (Example: [[Dormammu]], [[Nightmare]]), and other extra-terrestial threats.{{Citation}}
*'''[[Spells and Phrases|Various other spells]]:''' These spells seem to be quicker to perform but lesser in power than spells using divine energy. Strange has used his magics altogether to alter his clothing through something akin to minor molecular control, control and manipulate elements, matter manipulation, etc.
* Dr. Strange has also been shown to amass as much wealth/gold as he desires using magic, as he has done to pay debts he owed.{{Citation}}

'''The Words:''' Doctor Strange has become an expert in the [[Black Priests (Multiverse)|Black Priests]]'s ability to use language to distort reality, becoming even more capable than the Black Priests themselves in a short amount of time. Each "word" is a symbol which means "something." The addition of another symbol can change the meaning of that "something." Doctor Strange stated this method to be akin to [[wikipedia:Substitution cipher|replacement cipher]]. This way, he can distort the reality in different ways, depending how many symbols are said and in which order. Some of the features achieved by the use of Words include:
*'''[[Energy Blasts]]'''{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 13}}
*'''[[Pyrokinesis]]'''{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 13}}
*'''[[Cryokinesis]]'''{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 27}}
*'''[[Organic Disintegration]]'''{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 13}}
*'''[[Paralysis]]'''{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 27}}

'''Divine Sources:''' Dr. Strange can channel the extra-dimensional energy of mystical and non-mystical beings in multiple dimensions (known as Principalities) to empower his spells. This can take the form of standard spells ("Crimson Bands of [[Cyttorak (Earth-616)|Cyttorak]]") or just state what he wants to occur and channeling some being to make it happen. It is unknown at this time what debt, if any, he incurs by invoking the powers that be. There is no strict quid pro quo (as the simple acknowledgment and invoking of the entity increases the entity's own powers, inexplicably), though some entities will feel he is obliged to heed their call when they need help in their conflicts as did the [[Vishanti]]. This ability to be a conduit to multiversal power sources has given rise to the phrase "Dr. Strange is as powerful as the god he invokes." Doctor Strange's powers typically come from one of three divine sources: The [[Vishanti]] (a trinity formed of [[Hoggoth]], [[Oshtur]], and [[Agamotto]]), the [[Octessence]] (a group of eight beings, consisting of Balthakk, Cyttorak, Farallah, Ikonn, Krakkan, Raggadorr, Valtorr, and Watoomb) and other beings who owe him a debt (this includes [[Satannish]] and even [[Dormammu]]). However, certain abilities of his stem from more obscure sources, such as the Faltine, the Seraphim, Cinnibus, Sheol, Ikthalon, Denak, Cyndriarr, Munnopor, Morpheus, Dyzakk, the Olympian deities (such as [[Poseidon]] and Hades) and others.{{Citation}}

'''Darkness of the Divine Conduit (Black Magic):''' By sheer force of will "take" the power of another entity. This does not require the use of a spell. He used this ability against Arioch and Shuma-Gorath. The fact that Stephen can do this is a testament to his incredible willpower and strength of mind. This is considered black magic and as such he rarely employs this. Also when taking the powers of celestial entities he absorbs the mind and assumes their duties and roles in the dimension in which they exist. If his will falters, he can lose all sense of self.{{Citation}}

Although Dr. Strange primarily uses spells that are considered 'white magic', he will use spells from other disciplines such as black magic, elemental magic, and catastrophe magic when necessary.{{Citation}} 

Dr. Strange's powers are all mystical but take several forms. Main manifestations include:

* It is said that he cannot use magic that can replicate anything discovered by human science.{{r|Doctor Strange: The Oath #1|5}}
* By force of will, Dr. Strange can "take" the power of another entity. This does not require the use of a spell. He uses this ability against [[Captain Universe]] as well as against Arioch and [[Shuma-Gorath (Multiverse)|Shuma-Gorath]] in {{cl|Strange Tales Vol 2|Strange Tales (vol. 2)}}. Strange also uses this to drain the Wrecking Crew of the Asgardian magic they had been infused by [[Karnilla (Earth-616)|Karnilla]], though this causes him great mental agony and takes a long time. This is considered black magic and as such, he rarely employs this. Also, when taking the powers of entities, he can absorb their mind and assume their duties and roles in the dimension in which they exist. But, if his will falters, he can lose all sense of self.{{Citation}}
* Dr. Strange also became proficient in Black Magic under the tutelage of Kaluu, including using the necromantic energy released in death for various effects. After he purged Shuma-Gorath from himself, he has since stopped using black magic.<ref>In the Black Magic saga in {{cl|Strange Tales Vol 2|Strange Tales (vol. 2)}}</ref>
* At a certain period, Dr. Strange became a receptacle of Earth's Gaia magic through the use of a forge built with the support of all his magical artifacts. This energy was exhausted in the War of Seven Spheres.{{Citation}}
** For a brief period, research from the Vishanti library led Strange to tap into "catastrophe magic" by invoking a mystical alignment of all the planets, but this source of magic was limited and he ceased using it specifically as a source of his power.{{Citation}}
* Strange's magical powers at their greatest peak exceeds that of even the Watcher [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu]] and rivals that of other great beings, such as [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] or [[Celestials (Earth-616)|Celestials]].{{Citation}}

| Abilities               = 
'''Former Expert Surgeon/Surgical Consultant:''' Strange holds an M.D. in neurosurgery and was once considered one of the foremost experts in his field. However, the nerve damage he suffered in his car crash severely compromised the manual dexterity in his hands, preventing him from performing surgery except when temporarily supplemented by magic. 

Even without magic, Strange retains his medical knowledge. He still practices medicine,{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 27}} was the Illuminati's surgeon,{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 3}} and can guide other less skilled, yet un-maimed surgeons through intense effort, and is still capable of serving as a consultant.{{Citation}}

'''Expert Occultist & Magical Knowledge:''' During his studies which continued until recently Dr. Strange has gain expert awareness on cults and the extra-dimensional entities they worship, this knowledge as of yet far exceeds any on Earth in the Marvel Universe.{{Citation}}

'''Expert Strategist:''' Though Stephen seems to suffer from an impulsive nature, instinctively jumping into situations of life-or-death, it's apparent that he works best this way possessing considerable strategic skills, which has been employed in leadership structures, and spontaneous situations, all of which is a necessity in the random environment of Mysticism.{{Citation}}

'''[[Martial arts|Expert Martial Artist]]:''' Dr. Strange is a skilled athlete and was trained in the martial arts used by Tibetan monks in [[Kamar Taj]], proving sufficiently talented to pass down such training to others, such as [[Clea (Earth-616)|Clea]]. These talents have assisted him from time-to-time when incapable of using his sorcery. Strange is a formidable opponent to any skilled attacker and continues to train regularly with [[Wong (Earth-616)|Wong]].{{r|Doctor Strange: The Oath Vol 1 5}} He has in some cases, been known to occasionally spar with other heroes; in one case, Strange was able to evade a kung fu hand-chop by [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]] (the future mother of the [[Quoi]]) "only three others have ever done" and who has been able to subdue [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] in sheer physical combat, despite his strength nearly hundreds of times superior to her own.{{Citation}}

| Strength                = Normal human male with intensive regular exercise.

| Weaknesses              = '''Science-Based Weakness:''' It has been said Strange's power is weaker against strictly science-based opponents.

'''Incantations and Gestures Dependency:''' Strange also depends on spoken incantations, mystical gesturing, and his arcane artifacts in his duties; likely these can be counted as weaknesses. Strange has been incapacitated various times by being gagged and bound, preventing him from uttering arcane invocations or performing mystic gestures. The Hulk breaking his hands greatly crippled his magic ability.{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 3}}

'''Human Factor:''' Another weakness is that Strange, despite all his spells and magical training, is only human physically. Hence, if not taking proper care or defenses, Strange can be overpowered by mere blows, energy attacks, or gas. While technically immortal per se, he still must eat, sleep and breathe in order to survive.{{Citation}}

'''Astro-Limits:''' Such is the skill and mastery of Doctor Strange that he is capable of spending up to 24 hours upon the astral plane before he must rejoin his ethereal form with his physical one, lest succumb to corporeal deterioration leading to bodily death and eternal suspension as a spirit.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 121|page 3}} The physical form remains in an inert, death-like trance, vulnerable to both physical and magical forms of harm while the astral form is absent. If harm were to befall his physical form while he was in his astral form, he would be stranded in his wraith-like state. Though Strange has only his personal abilities in his astral form, the Ring of the Ancient One/Ring (of Full Power) can grant him access to the same resources he possesses in his physical body; however, certain writers and editors appear to have portrayed Strange in an astral form capable of feats beyond his personal abilities even without the Ring.{{Citation}} According to Baron Mordo, the intense atomic radiation of the sun's core can change the composition of astral forms.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 134}}

'''Magic-Induced Physical Changes:''' A fact not known by many people is that the use of magic takes a physical toll on its user. During his first lessons, Stephen vomited for three days straight because of this. As years went by, Strange's body changed so much his stomach can't even accept human food and can only ingest that which would kill a normal person.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 4}}

| Equipment               = * Normally wears the [[Cloak of Levitation]], the [[Eye of Agamotto]], and the [[Orb of Agamotto]]. He possesses a wide array of arcane texts, artifacts, and relics.

Strange's own power is often amplified by the numerous magical artifacts that are in his possession or by artifacts that he uses in the course of his adventures. The three artifacts he carries with him at all times are the Eye of Agamotto, the [[Cloak of Levitation]], and the yellow sash tied around his waist. At one point, due to his evoking [[Zom (Earth-616)|Zom]]'s dark power, he deemed himself no longer worthy of the office of Sorcerer Supreme and passed the responsibility of choosing the next one to the spirit of the Ancient One; Strange loses at least his principal magical items and old costume to [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Brother Voodoo]], the new Sorcerer Supreme of the Earth dimension and prime reality, but after recovering his office they have been recovered.

* '''The [[Eye of Agamotto]]''' (which resides within the Amulet of Agamotto worn at Dr. Strange's throat) is a powerful and valued artifact that has many functions. Using the Eye, Strange can see through any lie, deception, or illusion, send the eye out at light speed to intercept and absorb massive amounts of any type of energy and free others who are trapped in their own illusions. It is often used to amplify his mind's eye, giving psychic abilities that rival the most powerful of telepaths. It is also often used to play back an area's past events, lift beings weighing thousands of pounds into the air telekinetically, and open dimensional portals, as well as placing beings in suspended animation. The Eye can track beings by their psychic or magical emissions. The light given off by the Eye also weakens a variety of evil mystical beings, such as demons, devils, undead beings, dark extra dimensional entities, and even sufficiently corrupt human practitioners of dark magic. When used offensively, no being can withstand its light for long; due to its lethal effect, it is often used as a weapon of last resort. The Eye appears to be dimensionally linked to the Orb of Agamotto, and is presented to the current Sorcerer or Sorceress Supreme to aid them in their great duties. The amulet can only be used by a being with a pure heart and a clean soul. 

* '''The [[Cloak of Levitation]]''' allows him to fly (at roughly 25 miles per hour for indeterminate lengths of time), and responds to his thoughts. Strange has used it many times as a "third set of hands" to attack a foe when his own body has been incapacitated. The Cloak is nearly indestructible, often escaping damage during even the most violent confrontations. The cloak has acted independently from Strange as though it has a will of its own, as well as being quasi-sentient to some degree. The cloak has been nearly destroyed on at least three occasions:
:#''Strange Tales'' (vol. 1) #157 — During a battle with Zom at [[Stonehenge]]. Strange was able to reconstruct it in a display of power to prove to The Living Tribunal that Strange was worthy to set right the cosmic events recently unleashed
:#''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2, #77 — During a battle with the demon Khat while Strange was in the slow decline of his white-magical powers. The cloak was repaired by Enitharmon the Weaver, the former master of Strange's second apprentice, Rintrah. While the damage to the Cloak on this occasion was not as severe as previously, Strange was unable to repair it himself
:#The third instance is convoluted. During his attempt to garner a new power-base for himself, after foregoing the powers and protections of the Vishanti, Strange went underground to create his new power forge, and when he was finished he was rejuvenated, younger-looking and wearing a new costume (including a mystical black body suit) and he had transformed the Cloak into something more resembling a Kimono or robe{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 76}} however, soon he was drafted into the War of the Seven Spheres by the Vishanti. After battling for five thousand years in another dimension, Strange was returned to Earth (at a time mere months from when he was spirited away) a tattered shambles.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 80}} His magical abilities depleted and his new Robe/Cloak shredded. He soon incorporated elements of the cloak into what would be called the "Overcoat of Levitation"; a red trench coat with the Cloak's gold trim along the collar. He soon returned, however, to his traditional Cloak.
* The Sash of Dr. Strange, worn around Strange's waist, this enchanted yellow sash can be extended ten times its normal length.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 110}}
* '''The [[Orb of Agamotto]]''', a large crystal ball which he uses daily to monitor the surrounding dimensions and his own world for trouble; 
* '''The [[Wand of Watoomb]]''', which amplifies his power and absorbs mystical energy that can be utilized for a variety of effects, such as reopening dimensional portals and firing mystic bolts; a power-item that can be divided into two separate, though powerless, parts, and can restructure reality itself when combined with other mystical objects ''(Currently lost in another reality due to the meddling of [[Warren Traveler]] of the [[House of M]])''
* '''The [[Book of the Vishanti]]''', which contains some of the multiverse's most powerful and secret spells and counterspells for white magic, opposed to the dark arts of the [[Darkhold]]
* A wooden staff forged from Yggdrasil that greatly boosts his magic power but also risks damaging his body.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 383|384}}

He owns countless other artifacts he can bring out in times of need. Among them include:

* The [[Hands of the Dead]], a highly powerful item created fifteen centuries ago, that allows Strange and others to "enter the tides of time and space, travel the world in the blink of an eye, even be in several places at the same time" though can be damaging to one's non-material self if unused to such travel; used for Peter Parker in ''One More Day''
* The [[Atlantean Dreamwave]], used by Strange to explore the nightmares of [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|John Blaze]]
* The [[Book of Demonicus]], used by Strange to gain information on Avarrish.
* The [[Book of Eibon]], during the days of Hyperborea, about 750,200 years ago, it was the time of the wizard Eibon, greatest wizard of Hyperborea. He wrote his knowledge down in what became known to mankind as 'the Book of Eibon'. Over the millennia the Book of Eibon was owned by many sorcerers and collectors. It came into the hands of the Ancient One at one time, who passed the book on to his disciple Dr. Stephen Strange, who considers it one of his most treasured artifacts, though stolen by Urthona, yet was restored by Agamotto
* The [[Brazier of Bom'Galiath]], used by Strange to enable Eric Masterson to travel to Mephisto's Hell
* The [[Tome of Oshtur]], an ancient book of long-lost spells written by [[Oshtur]]
* The [[Serum of the Seraphim]], an all-purpose elixir capable of curing both mystic and non-mystic ailments, described as "the most potent medicine known to the occult"; the serum is so powerful that only a few ounces are needed. It is usually kept in tiny ornate containers holding just a few ounces. Any being drinking this serum is instantly returned to his full health and has all of his wounds healed. Any magical fungus, physical curses (like blindness), or diseases are held in check, then slowly cured over a few days time; either Strange has run out of the Serum recently or its powers have limits: it could not be used apparently to heal Wong's brain cancer or mend Strange's shattered hands 
* The [[Scrolls of Watoomb]], a precious source of magical knowledge written by [[Watoomb]] in an unidentified past, giving their user quicker and safer control over the Winds of Watoomb, as well as a greater power to the Winds; the Scrolls also increased the power of the sorcerer wielding them
* The [[Ring of the Ancient One]], which can be used to allow Doctor Strange to do anything he is capable of in physical form while astrally projecting, as well as to take on the form of the Ancient One himself
* The [[Crystal of Kadavus]] - The Crystal is a fist-sized, diamond-like gemstone that is cut to resemble a skull. When using the proper incantation and exposing it to the light of a full moon, it focuses dimensional forces. When this focused beam is aimed at a magical item it is completely restored to full power, even if the item had previously been drained of its magic powers or “destroyed”. This procedure must be repeated for at least two nights of the full moon before the item is restored to full power. The Crystal has been used to restore or contain the power of the Wand of Watoomb.
* The [[Eye of Zartra]], an enchanted "eldritch gem" plucked by Prince Namor from the Sword of Kamuu (thus halving its power) and given as a token of friendship to Strange; enhances the power of the ancient Atlantean Sword of Kammu and provides the Sword's user with immunity to magic 
* The [[Cauldron of the Cosmos]], kept in the Meditation Chamber and allowing Strange to "dwell upon the immutable mysteries of the universe" for hours, used basically for consultation and scrying 
* The [[Oculus Oroboros]] - The Oculus Oroboros is one of the most powerful, maybe 'the' most powerful conduit for elemental magick ever; gathers elemental magical energy and stores it to be used again at will. For centuries it was hidden for the senses of magicians by a cloaking spell, till the day that archaeologist disturbed it, and it was resurfaced again. The Oculus was collected by Strange's ethereal construct [[Paradox (Strange) (Earth-616)|Strange]] during the time that he was searching for amulets of Earthbound magick to fuel his new power source; depicts a snake eating its own tail.
* The [[Gaea Shard]], a crystal containing a sliver of the essence of the Elder Goddess Gaea, wielded by Dr. Strange against the Undying Ones.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Vol 1 41}}
* The [[Hand of the Vishanti]], capable of locating others by helping them expel their ethereal form and given to Peter Parker in order for him to track down Shade through Peter entering the Astral Plane; this amulet has the appearance of a simple stone carving resembling a hand; the hand makes it easier to transfer towards the astral plane, and holds a link so the wielder can find its way back.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 42}}
* The [[Jewel of Transhypnosis]], owned by the Ancient One, can teleport its wielder into another dimension by focusing their concentration upon it and has the power to transform matter into imagination. 
* The [[Kartkuthi]], a book held by Dr. Strange, one passage was read by Wong to liberate Strange's astral self when it had been trapped by a mystic sword of the Hand with which he had been impaled; Strange finished the spell to release his astral form and help the Avengers win the day by freeing Maya.{{r|New Avengers #31}}
* The [[Iris of the All-Seeing Oracle]], a summoning tool kept in the Sanctum Sanctorum used to scry upon specific locations and persons; This 8 foot diameter, circular device, with what looks like a mirror in the middle, hangs in Doctor Strange’s mansion. It is a secondary scrying device that Strange or his friends use when the Orb of Agamotto is inaccessible; the Iris allows two-way audio-visual communications with another mage of the user’s choosing anywhere on Earth. One must know the proper incantation to use it. 
* The [[Oracle of Agamotto]], a backup device used by Doctor Strange after the Orb was broken and before Clea mended it
* The [[Orb of Snnnr]], used by Dr. Strange to communicate with the Pitiful One.{{r|X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl #1}}
* [[Otkid's Elixir]], an immensely powerful potion able to cure all diseases on Earth that "has the power to erase what troubles the mind of man"; stolen from [[Otkid the Omnipotent (Earth-616)|Otkid]] by Dr. Strange, destroyed by [[Nicodemus West (Earth-616)|Nicodemus West]]; one drop was saved and used by Strange to cure Wong of brain cancer.{{r|Doctor Strange: The Oath #5}}
* The [[Scroll of Eternity]], kept for ages by the Aged Genghis (who gave it to Strange), it holds a spell that opens a gate to a mystic realm close to Eternity; it holds the name of Eternity and it can assume that the spell, when used properly, will indeed transport the caster to Eternity, but when only the slightest mistake is made, this spell will open a gate to a world ruled by a demon who is come to be known as the Demon in the Mask, the Realm of Eternal Madness 
* The [[Sword of the Ultimate Shadow]], a magical sword that is able to inflict great physical pain through the astral body, pain that cannot be stopped by mystical energies, even those as potent as the Shield of the Seraphim; once used by Strange's evil double from the Infinity War and is now again stored, protected by spells in his Sanctum Sanctorum.
* The [[Star of Capistan]], a ruby larger than any other existent, its sentience and wicked will of its own corrupted Strange, yet the Sorcerer Supreme, with a Eye of Agamotto having failed him, and his participation in the Order weakening his own sanity, used the Star as his amulet instead; the Star was sensitive to human brainwaves on a global and possibly even cosmic scale; Strange reverted to the Eye shortly, with the Star's current whereabouts unknown, though it is likely hidden, in the Sanctum Sanctorum or elsewhere due to its lethal and sinister nature
* The [[Purple Gem]], one of the many enchanted gems of power from the Purple Dimension of [[Aggamon]] passed down to Strange through the late Ancient One; a device to bridge the dimensions, it provides a means to enter (or become trapped in) the Purple Dimension, can amplify and focus the Eye of Agamotto's power, entrap an opponent, though ancient and cunning masters of Asgardian magic such as the god Loki resisted being sent to the Purple Dimension (or if he was actually sent there, he was able to return instantaneously under his own power) and the conjured portal was shattered by one gesture; said by Strange to have even greater hidden potential, and unlocks more of its vast power when used with a Dimensional Energy incantation that calls on Aggamon's strength.
* The [[Staff of Dravid]], used by Doctor Strange in battle with Wandor.
* The [[Talisman of Abraxas]], an amulet Doctor Strange gave to Namor the Sub-Mariner to palliate his personality shifts
* The [[Wands of Satannish]], objects kept by Strange within the Nisanti cabinet 
* The [[Diary of Kenneth Ward]] (who told Doctor Strange of his encounter with traces of the [[Undying Ones]] in a hidden Himalayan valley), kept by Strange in his Sanctum Sanctorum’s library, containing the location of the valley.{{r|Defenders #5}}
* Two mirrors, needed for a "radical spell" used to renew the enchanted barrier around the Sanctum Sanctorum
* A magic amulet given to him by the [[Ancient One]] in Strange's very first issue, ''Strange Tales Vol 1 110'', used to call upon his master even in spirit form to prevent a man from shooting him; the Ancient One placed a hypnotic spell on the man to stop him
* An enchanted deck of tarot cards known as the First Tarot Deck utilized by Doctor Strange with his subconscious mind after the original Defenders had disbanded, to choose the best heroes to handle the problem for the [[Secret Defenders]]; the heroes would go each their separate ways after the problem was solved; the Deck was used by [[Ian McNee]] to profile magic and its users in the {{cl|Marvel Tarot Vol 1 1|Marvel Tarot}}
* An magical amulet given to [[Eric Masterson]] by Strange to shield him from detection from the demons in Mephisto's Hell; lost in Hell
* Mystic ruby crystals given to Valkyrie by Doctor Strange to be used to “point the way” to the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] and [[Namor]]; the crystals appear to flash with bright light when they are in proximity to either one, as well as spinning around in such a fashion its pointed edge points to whichever direction the Hulk and Namor is currently at
* [[Two Gems That Are One]], magical jewels stolen from Dr. Strange by Urthona.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 81}}

[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) from New Avengers Illuminati Vol 2 2 001.jpg|thumb|Dr. Strange with the [[Soul Stone|Soul Gem]]]]
As a result of being a member of the Illuminati, he has also come into possession of the [[Soul Stone|Soul Gem]] of the [[Infinity Gauntlet]], though he has sworn not to ever use it or to reveal its location, having lost since lost his soul to it, despite its hunger for such ethereal forces. Strange also once kept the Book of the [[Darkhold]] in his library of the Sanctum Sanctorum, using it to invoke the Montesi Formula and destroy all vampires in the Marvel Universe, as well as using it among his other items in an attempt to defeat [[Adam Warlock]] but it has since been removed. Strange was also in possession of the virtually indestructible sword [[Dragonfang]], capable of destroying certain mystic barriers as well as absorbing magic when in contact with blood; Dragonfang was carved from the tusk of an extradimensional dragon by an Oriental wizard named Kahji-Da and fallen into the possession of the [[Ancient One (Earth-616)|Ancient One]], who in turn passed it down to his disciple, Dr. Strange. Dr. Strange then passed it onto Valkyrie; during the events of Ragnarok, she fell in battle and the sword got picked up by Lady [[Sif]], lover of Thor, though Sif, too, eventually fell before Asgard's demise. Valkyrie has not yet been revived, as shown in ''[[Mystic Arcana|Mystic Arcana]]''.

A desperate Strange was forced to use a spell to destroy all his magical artifacts to prevent the wicked Urthona from obtaining them, even his Orb of Agamotto (though the Darkhold was unable to be destroyed even by Strange's magic). However, it is later revealed that [[Agamotto]] himself had teleported the artifacts to his own realm, and Strange later retrieved them from him, months later. 

Dr. Strange shrunk his talismans and hid them behind the Eye of Agamotto. He restored them to their size when he was forced to confront the Infinity Gauntlet God-made Adam Warlock. The Scrolls of Watoomb were really useful to cancel the effects of the Gem of Space, the Winds of Watoomb recalled reading the Scrolls enabled Strange, Pip, and Gamora to cover a distance of light-years in few seconds. Shortly later, Strange had to use all the talismans to increase his own powers and match, even if only for a few moments, the power of Adam Warlock. After the fight, Strange went back home and put the scrolls and the other talismans in their right place in his room.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 36}}

Finally, his Sanctum Sanctorum, due to the magic imbued within it, can be thought of as an artifact itself. The Sanctum consistently has a circular window with three swooping lines; this design has stayed with the building despite the window's destruction on many occasions. The design is actually the Seal of the Vishanti found in the window of Dr. Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum; it protects the Sanctorum from most supernatural (and even most non-mystical) invaders, also called "Window of the Worlds," or the Anomaly Rue.{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 110}} This seal has failed in barring out [[Hiroim]] the Shadow Priest, when he utilized the ancient power of the Shadow Elders (though Hiroim was not truly evil, but grieving and angered). Certain members of the New Avengers appear to acknowledge this, and [[Chemistro]] of the Hood's army, though possessing no such power to directly break that of the [[Vishanti]]'s, was able to change the chemical composition of the wood that held the seal to break it.

| Notes                   = * Dr. Strange was the subject of [[Dr. Strange (film)|a 1978 made-for-television film]] produced through Universal Television Studios and transmitted by the CBS Television Network, which starred Peter Hooten as Dr. Stephen Strange (described within as a young psychiatry resident rather than an experienced surgeon) alongside Clyde Kusatsu as Wong, with Anne-Marie Martin as Clea Lake; the film also co-starred John Mills as Thomas Lindmer (a character created specifically for the film) and Michael Ansara (who was not credited) as the voice of the Ancient One, and all acted versus Jessica Walter as the evil Morgan Le Fey. Philip DeGuere Jr., better known for creating and producing ''Simon & Simon,'' wrote and directed the said film. (The film's setting continuum is [[Earth-96173]].)
* The mansion where Dr. Strange lives, his [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], is located at 177A Bleecker Street, [[Greenwich Village]], [[New York City]], [[New York (State)|New York]] which in this universe was the actual address of the apartment building in which the series writer at that time actually lived.
* Doctor Strange is one of the characters featured in Series A of the Marvel Value Stamp collection of the 1970's. [[File:Doctor Strange Marvel Value Stamp.jpg|right|thumb|Marvel Value Stamp #13]]
*''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104115/ Doctor Mordrid]'' (1992), a film starring Jeffrey Combs as the titular hero, was originally developed as a feature film by Full Moon Entertainment about Dr. Strange. However, rights to the character and name were lost, and the movie was reworked -- though fans of the comics character can easily see the similarities.
* The hand gestures that Doctor Strange does seems to have been based on the [[Wikipedia:Mudra|Mudra]] from Asian religions.
** Doctor Strange shares similar hand gesture with Spider-Man, who was also co-created by [[Steve Ditko|Steve Ditko]], sticking out their thumb, pointing and pinky fingers. This was also acknowledged by the characters themselves in {{cl|Spider-Man: Fever Vol 1 3}}.
| Trivia                  = * Dr. Strange and the Fantastic Four are mentioned in the song ''Superbird'' on the album "Electric Music for the Mind and Body", by Country Joe and the Fish (Vanguard VSD 79244; released January 1967).
* Strange is also mentioned in Pink Floyd's song ''Cymbaline'' on the album "More" (released July 27, 1968), and in T. Rex song ''Mambo Sun'' on the album "Electric Warrior" (released September 1971).
* Dr. Strange appears on the cover of Pink Floyd's album ''A Saucerful of Secrets'' (released June 29, 1968), and on the covers of the Al Stewart albums ''Past Present and Future'' (levitating into a dimensional portal) and ''Modern Times''.
* Allusions to Dr. Strange appear in Tom Wolfe's non-fiction book ''The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test'' (1968). Wolfe himself made a cameo appearance in {{cl|Doctor Strange Vol 1 180}} (May 1969).
* In Jean-Luc Godard's film ''Sympathy for the Devil'' (1968), the camera pans across a ''Dr. Strange'' comic in the leftist bookstore.
* At the beginning of his run in [[Doctor Strange Vol 1|''Doctor Strange'']], when Stephen lost the title of Sorcerer Supreme to Loki, writer [[Donny Cates]] had him become a veterinarian as sort of an homage to the profession. Cates' cat Autumn had died shortly before he was assigned to ''Doctor Strange'', and he looked up to the vets that had treated her before she ultimately passed away. Autumn's death additionally inspired that of Strange's friend, the talking dog [[Bats (Earth-616)|Bats]].{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/doctor-strange-loki-sentry-donny-cates-interview|title=To Defeat Loki, Donny Cates Teams Doctor Strange with… The Sentry?|work=CBR.com|first=Dave|last=Richards|date=20 December 2017|accessdate=26 December 2017}}}}
* Stephen's blood type is B Positive.{{r|Doctor Strange: The Oath Vol 1 1}}
* Doctor Strange was the first one able to discover that the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Black Suit]] Spider-Man had  gotten after the [[Secret Wars (1984 Event)|Secret Wars]], was alive and controlling Spider-Man. However, he didn't reveal this to anyone, since he promised the symbiote that he would keep its secret.{{r|Symbiote Spider-Man: Alien Reality Vol 1 3}}
* His alias as "Iron Mage",{{r|Savage Avengers Vol 1 9}} might be reference to the character of the same name from ''[[Ptolus: City by the Spire Vol 1|Ptolus: City by the Spire]]'' from ''[[wikipedia:Ptolus|Dungeons & Dragons]]'', which was adapted in comic book form by Marvel Comics.
* In {{cl|Tarot Vol 1 3}} the two halves of Doctor Strange merged with the halves of [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] and [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] to create [[Scarlet Strange (Earth-616)|Scarlet Strange]] and [[Doctor Surf (Earth-616)|Doctor Surf]].
