===Origins===
'''Noh-Varr''' was a member of the [[Kree]] race located in the alternate reality of [[Earth-200080]]. He had his triple-helix DNA altered with cockroach genes to include insect properties,{{r|Marvel Boy Vol 2 1}}<!-- verify, later version literally mention insect/cockcroach genes --> and became a [[Kree Super-Soldiers|super-soldier]].{{r|Civil War: Young Avengers and Runaways #2}}

He joined the [[18th Kree Diplomatic Gestalt (Earth-200080)|18th Kree Diplomatic Gestalt]] as '''Ensign Marvel''', a peacekeeping group charged with maintaining the cease-fire between that reality's Kree and [[Skrulls|Skrull]] races while travelling aboard their ship, [[Marvel (Vehicle)|the Marvel]].{{r|Marvel Boy Vol 2 1}}

===Arrival to Earth-616===
After a clash with three [[Aspirants|Astro-Gods]], Noh-Varr and his crew became lost in the Multiverse. While attempting to return home, they ended up arriving to [[Earth-616|Reality-616]], over that universe's planet [[Earth]]. Their ship was shot down by [[Doctor Midas (Earth-616)|Dr. Midas]], an individual obsessed with obtaining super-human powers, in an attempt to claim their [[Glossary:Cosmic Radiation|cosmic ray]]-powered star drive to mutate himself. The crash killed the Marvel's entire crew, including Noh-Varr's parents, [[Captain Glory (Earth-200080)|Captain Glory]] and [[Star Splendor (Earth-200080)|Star Splendor]], and his girlfriend [[Merree (Earth-200080)|Merree]], save for Noh-Varr himself, who ended up captured by Midas.<!-- {{r|Marvel Boy Vol 2 1}} -->

Noh-Varr's capture was short-lived as he escaped using his enhanced abilities. His artificial intelligence [[We-Plex Supreme Intelligence System (Earth-200080)|Plex]] advised Noh-Varr to lay low, however, the temperamental boy had plans to get revenge against the entire human race for the brutal treatment his crew received upon arriving to their world.{{r|Marvel Boy Vol 2 1}}

Noh-Varr sent his message of revenge by destroying blocks of buildings in [[New York City|New York]], attracting the attention of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and clashing with their [[United Nations Bannermen (Earth-616)|Bannermen]], a battle that Noh-Varr would easily win with his advanced Kree technology.{{r|Marvel Boy Vol 2 2}}

Noh-Varr soon learned that a social parasite called [[Hexus (Earth-N)|Hexus]] (former prisoner aboard the Marvel), had been unleashed upon the Earth and became a sentient corporation bent on taking over the entire world. Noh-Varr clashed with the forces of the Hexus until he succeeded in destroying it by accessing its corporate secrets and providing them to its competitors, crushing it as a business enterprise and subsequently destroying it.{{r|Marvel Boy Vol 2 3}}

Dr. Midas, still seeking out the cosmic ray engine of Noh-Varr's ship, sent his daughter [[Oubliette Midas (Earth-616)|Oubliette Midas]], also known as the [[Exterminatrix]], to capture Noh-Varr. Her assault on his was successful and she turned him over to her father for a violent interrogation. However, she would soon have a change of heart when Noh-Varr saw her true face and found her attractive, freeing him from her father's clutches and returning him to his ship.{{r|Marvel Boy Vol 2 4}} Midas tracked both of them down via a tracking device in the Exterminatrix's mask and sent one of the [[Dark Dimension]]'s [[Mindless Ones]] that he had in his possession to destroy them while he attempted to claim the star drive. Exterminatrix was successful in decapitating the creature while Noh-Varr clashed with Midas, who had just used the cosmic ray drive to mutate himself into the Cosmic Man.{{r|Marvel Boy Vol 2 5}}

In the final clash between Noh-Varr and Midas, the Exterminatrix used the head of the Mindless One to seemingly destroy her father. S.H.I.E.L.D. agents subsequently surrounded Noh-Varr's ship, taking him into custody. The Exterminatrix started a reign of terror demanding Noh-Varr's release but she ended up incarcerated in the [[Raft]]. Noh-Varr was then imprisoned in the [[Cube]] where he declared war on the human race and vowed to make the planet Earth part of the [[Kree Empire]],{{r|Marvel Boy Vol 2 6}} boasting  to the [[Cube Warden (Earth-616)|warden]] that the Cube would become the capital of his new Kree Empire within five months.{{r|Civil War: Young Avengers and Runaways #4}}

===Incarceration and Break-Out===
During his incarceration Noh-Varr was briefly visited by the members of the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] who tried to change Noh-Varr's mind and offered him the chance to earn his freedom, with the condition to cease his quest for revenge.{{r|New Avengers: Illuminati Vol 2 4}} Subsequently, Noh-Varr was broken and turned into a docile assassin, dubbed '''Mobile Defense Unit 564''', by the warden.{{r|Civil War: Young Avengers and Runaways #4}}

During the [[Civil War (Event)|Superhuman Civil War]], S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] visited the Cube and ordered the warden to send Noh-Varr after the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]]. Noh-Varr attacked them and the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]], breaking [[Xavin (Earth-616)|Xavin]]'s neck and taking down all of the other members. The [[Vision (Jonas) (Earth-616)|Vision]] managed to phase his arm into Noh-Varr's chest, but Noh-Varr tore it away and took [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]], [[Dorrek VII (Earth-616)|Hulkling]], [[Karolina Dean (Earth-616)|Karolina]], and Xavin back to the Cube with him. The Vision's arm began to interface with his body, which began causing problems. The combined forces of the Runaways and Young Avengers broke into the Cube to free their teammates, and Noh-Varr was deployed to stop them. [[Victor Mancha (Earth-616)|Victor]], knowing that the feedback of touching the Vision caused them both to have seizures, grabbed Noh-Varr, which freed him from the warden's mental control. Noh-Varr then took control of the Cube.{{r|Civil War: Young Avengers and Runaways #2|4}}

===[[Secret Invasion]]===
During the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|Invasion]], the Cube's systems and [[We-Plex Supreme Intelligence System (Plex II) (Earth-616)|Plex II]] (assembled from Plex's remains) were turned off by a Skrull computer virus.{{r|Secret Invasion #1}}{{r|Secret Invasion: Who Do You Trust? #1}} Escaping the prison, Noh-Varr came across the fallen body of [[Khn'nr (Earth-616)|Khn'nr]], who was impersonating the Kree hero [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]]. As Khn'nr lay dying, he asked Noh-Varr to save Earth.{{r|Secret Invasion #6}}{{r|Mighty Avengers #19}} Inspired, Noh-Varr made his way to New York City and participated in the battle against the Skrull invaders, helping to turn the tide.{{r|Secret Invasion #7|8}} When the battle had ended, Noh-Varr returned to his cell in the Cube.{{r|Secret Invasion #8}}

===Dark Avengers===
In the end of the Skrull invasion, reformed supervillain [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] became a national hero and the head of the superhuman community. While recruiting a new team of [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], Osborn came to Noh-Varr and convinced him to join his team under the alias of '''Captain Marvel'''.{{r|Dark Avengers #1}} After their first mission in taking on [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]], Noh-Varr slept with teammate [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Karla Sofen]], aka Moonstone. However, he was shocked when he learned from her that most of these Avengers were composed of criminals pretending to be heroes.{{r|Dark Avengers #5}} He then abandoned the team.{{r|Dark Avengers #6}}

<!-- At some point after leaving the Dark Avengers: Dark Reign: The List: Wolverine: Noh-Varr informed Wolverine of Osborn's plans to seize the World. -->After leaving Osborn's employ, he was attacked by the Sentry, but escaped. Noh-Varr fled to an abandoned building with one of many Kree communicators he had secretly built during his time on Earth, as attempted to contact the Kree [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]]. A holographic message left by the Supreme Intelligence told Noh-Varr that the actions of the Skrulls during Secret Invasion had left Earth in more danger than ever before and that he was the planet's new '''[[Protector]]'''. The Supreme Intelligence then granted him the power needed to carry out his mission in the form a set of [[Nega-Bands]], more advanced than the ones worn by the original Captain Marvel. The bands also provided him with a new costume and prevented the Dark Avengers from detecting his presence.<!-- {{r|Dark Avengers Annual #1}}{{Verify source}} -->

[[File:Noh-Varr (Earth-200080) from Dark Avengers Annual Vol 1 1 0003.jpg|thumb|left|As Protector|300px]]
Unbeknownst to Noh-Varr, he was being observed by [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]], who were trying to determine if he could be a potential ally against Osborn. During this time Noh-Varr also developed a romance with a girl named [[Annie (Noh-Varr) (Earth-616)|Annie]].{{r|Dark Avengers Annual #1}}

===[[Heroic Age (Event)|Heroic Age]]===
Following the [[Siege (Event)|Siege of Asgard]] and Osborn's fall, Protector was recruited by the newly-reformed [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] while to build a time machine as they needed one to confront [[Kang the Conqueror]]. During the construction process, a malfunction caused beings of other timelines to be brought to this one. Protector, Iron Man, Captain America and Wolverine traveled to the future while the rest of the team stayed in the present to control the situation.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 #2|6}} In the aftermath, Protector permanently joined the Avengers and stayed with them during threats like the return of [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|the Hood]] and the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]]'s [[Fear Itself|attack]].{{r|Avengers Vol 4 #7|17}}

===[[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers vs. X-Men]]===
As he was preparing for a mission to space to intercept and contain the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]], Noh-Varr was given a mission by the Supreme Intelligence of this universe's [[Kree Empire]]: to deliver it to them.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 25}} While in space, Protector stole a sample the Avengers possessed of the Phoenix Force they needed to impede the entity's approach towards Earth and delivered it to the Kree on [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]].{{r|Avengers Vol 4 26}}

After learning from the Intelligence that the Kree had little to no intention of helping Earth survive annihilation at the Phoenix's hands, he rebelled and stole back the container holding the Phoenix's essence while dodging attacks from Kree soldiers. When the Avengers finally caught up with him after nearly escaping certain death due to Protector's tampering with the guidance system of their ship, they were no more pleased with Noh-Varr than the Kree. Noh-Varr tried to plea for forgiveness, offering his help, but he was rebuked by the Avengers for his earlier betrayal and even threatened. When the Avengers left Hala, they left Noh-Varr stranded without his Nega-Bands.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 27}}

===Young Avengers===
As he didn't wanted to leave Earth, Noh-Varr established a satellite base in the orbit, and also started a relationship with young heroine [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], leaving his identity of Protector away. During this time, he became a fan of Earth's culture, particularly its music.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 1}} As '''Marvel Boy''', Noh-Varr joined Hawkeye in assisting her former teammates from the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] from the interdimensional parasite known as [[Mother (Interdimensional Parasite) (Earth-TRN287)|Mother]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 4}} Once Mother was vanished, the Young Avengers decided to leave Earth in order to prevent the parasite from returning, as [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]] explained they couldn't go back to any place their parents were or had died or Mother would be able to return. Marvel Boy joined the team in their subsequent journey across the universe while Wiccan sharpened his skills in magic in order to eventually confront and defeat Mother once and for all.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 5}}  

[[File:Noh-Varr (Earth-200080) from Young Avengers Vol 2 4 001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Guns blazing with the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]]]]

He later accompanied the rest of the Young Avengers to the warehouse where [[Thomas Shepherd (Earth-616)|Speed]] was abducted, after they were contacted by Prodigy. During the following pursuit of the fake Patriot across the multiverse, they came across numerous mayfly dimensions where Noh-Varr conquered the Earth and made it the capital of the New Kree Empire. During this time, Noh-Varr also decided to grow a beard.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 8}}

Noh-Varr later learned that Leah had recruited his exes, Merree and Oubliette and Annie, to her anti Young Avengers team. This caused him to begin to question his relationship with Kate, but he kept his thoughts to himself. Later, when he saw an online post from Oubliette dissing his beard, he decided to shave it off.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 11}}

The Young Avengers were forced to go back to Earth after [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulking]], who had previously left the team and returned to Earth, was tricked by Mother's allies into going back to New York, which allowed her to manifest again in this reality. Aiding Mother were a misfit counterpart of the [[Young Avengers (Constructs) (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] assembled by [[Leah (Construct) (Earth-616)|Leah]] composed of the ex-boyfriends and ex-girlfriends of the team, including Merree, Annie and the Exterminatrix.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 11}} In the midst of the battle against the evil Young Avengers, Noh-Varr decided to break up with Hawkeye in order to return to Oubliette. Unfortunately for him, it was soon revealed all of the evil Young Avengers were nothing but constructs fueled by Loki's sense of guilt. Once Loki admitted his crimes, all of the evil Young Avengers simply faded into nothing. Noh-Varr immediately tried to get back with Kate, to no avail.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 13}}

Noh-Varr subsequently DJ'ed the Young Avengers' celebration party of their victory against Mother and New Year's Eve. He attempted to end his relationship with Hawkeye in good terms, but she denied him the chance.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 14}} Realizing he had messed it up, Noh-Varr decided to move forward and stop dwelling on the past.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 15}}

===Original Sins===
After the murder of the watcher, Hulkling and [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|Prodigy]] decided to inform Noh-Varr about Exterminatrix, his ex's, involvement. When they couldn't reach him by phone they traveled to his personal satellite. Together they managed to sneak into New York by having Hulkling impersonate [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-616)|Phillip Coulson]]. After they arrived they noticed a civilian that had not been evacuated and pursued her into a building where they were assaulted by [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|The Hood]].{{r|Original Sins #1}} After a brief scuffle he surrendered and explained that the people in the building are his friends who were affected by the Watcher's Eye but he did not trust S.H.I.E.L.D to help them. Though he proceeded to take Prodigy hostage afterwards in an attempt to force him to build a [[Cerebro]].{{r|Original Sins #2}} 

However, he was quickly disarmed by Noh-Varr, yet he still managed to convince the Young Avengers of his plan to use a makeshift Cerebro to remove the excess information from the civilians. Prodigy created the machine and it was nicknamed Cerebrat by Hulkling.{{r|Original Sins #3}} They followed through with The Hoods plan until Noh-Varr discovered the Hood was uploading the info to the internet and a fight broke out.{{r|Original Sins #4}} The Hood escaped and the Young Avengers thought they had lost until Prodigy revealed that he had "Padded" the data so that it was impossible for anyone to use.{{r|Original Sins #5}}

===The Progenitors===
Now dedicated to save the universe, Marvel Boy set his sights on rebuilding the then-recently decimated Kree Empire.{{r|Royals #5}} To this end, he offered his services to the [[House of Agon (Earth-616)|Inhuman Royal Family]], offering them to help Inhumanity overcome the tribulations presented by the destruction of all traces of the [[Terrigen Mist]] by investigating the roots of their species in the ruins of Hala.{{r|Royals #1}}

[[File:Royals Vol 1 5 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
Once the expedition reached its destination, Marvel Boy planted the seed of the Plex Intelligence in the remains of the Supreme Intelligence. The resulting process ended in the resurrection of the Plex Intelligence, with the absorbed material from the other Supreme Intelligence. Thanks to the Plex Intelligence, Noh-Varr and the Inhumans learned of the existence of [[Primagen]], the substance from which Terrigen derived, which had been used by the eons-old race known as the [[Progenitors]] to create the Kree in the same way the Kree went on the create the Inhumans.{{r|Royals #5}}

On the Plex Intelligence's guidance, Noh-Varr and the Inhuman crew traveled to [[Centauri-IV]] to investigate the [[Skyspear]] which had landed there.{{r|Royals #6}} The Inhuman [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus the Mad]] calculated the trajectory of the Skyspear back to its point of origin, the Progenitor's [[World Farm]]. The crew was attacked by the Progenitors as soon as the approached their base,{{r|Royals #9}} barely making it alive to a Primagen deposit. When the explorers were attacked by two Exterminator and Destroyer-Class Progenitors, Noh-Varr was immolated, barely surviving thanks to his genes' special adaptation. Noh-Varr was then carried into a crystal pod created by [[Jaycen (Earth-616)|Flint]] with which the Inhumans escaped from the World Farm with samples of Primagen.{{r|Royals #11}}

===West Coast Avengers===
Noh-Varr later returned to Earth in order to infiltrate the [[Masters of Evil West Coast (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil West Coast]] by masquerading as [[Franklin Hall (Earth-616)|Graviton]]; however, he was forced to blow his cover in order to rescue the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]] when they got captured.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 7}} Later on, back at the Avengers base, he explained the reason he returned was because he believed that Skrulls were hiding out on the West Coast. That being as it may when they eventually investigated the Temple of the Shifting Sun it was revealed that they were in fact vampires.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 8}}

After the battle with the vampire cultists, Noh-Varr was trapped in a pit alongside [[Johnny Watts (Earth-616)|Fuse]], Kate's current boyfriend. After being electrocuted by the walls, he managed to throw Fuse out of the hole and was in turn lifted out by [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin]].{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 9}} After being freed, he participated in the final battle against the Temple of the Shifting Sun and provided Kate and Clint with Kree energy bows.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 10}}  

===[[Annihilation - Scourge]]===
When the [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|Sentry]] begun leading the forces of the [[Cancerverse]] into invading the [[Negative Zone]], and then the [[Earth-616|Posiverse]], [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] used his Dimensional Anchor to gather various heroes, including Noh-Varr, into battling the evil forces. In the aftermath, [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Bob Reynolds]] re-merged with the Void, while [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] sacrificed himself in order to defeat the evil forces.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge Omega #1}}

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
As the reborn [[Olympians]] begun causing havoc through the universe, Nova recruited Marvel Boy into a mission to stop the rampaging gods, resulting in Noh-Varr joining the other heroes heeded by Nova, the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. During the mission to infiltrate [[New Olympus]], the Guardians stumbled into an imprisoned [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 1}} The mission to destroy New Olympus was a success, though the apparent death of [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] caused the Guardians to split.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 3}} Marvel Boy remained with the half of the Guardians led by Nova. The two teams quickly clashed over competing missions involving an energy-converting device named the [[D-Type Converter]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 4}} As a result of the mission, that saw the two teams reach a truce, Marvel Boy and Hercules began a casual romantic relationship.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 6}}

During this time, Noh-Varr also joined the [[Galactic Council (Earth-616)|Galactic Council]] as a representative of the Utopian Kree faction. Druing an assembly aboard the [[Proscenium]], Marvel Boy became the prime suspect of the murder of [[Zn'rx]] emperor [[Stote (Earth-616)|Stote]] after being found out with the body only a few moments after having stumbled into it.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 7}} [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]]'s investigation cleared Noh's name and revealed the true culprit as the [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elder of the Universe]] named the [[Profiteer (Earth-616)|Profiteer]], who had infiltrated the meeting under the disguise of an ambassador.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 8}} Not long afterward, Star-Lord would return heralding the vengeful Olympians.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 9}} After the Guardians defeated the mad gods, the team was officially sanctioned by the Galactic Council as protectors of the cosmos.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 12}}

It shifts whoever enters it into a pocket dimension with its own specialized physics.{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 3}} He's seen using it again to keep the Asterion he and the Inhuman Royals commandeered from crashing into a fiery wreck with them still on it by treating the falling, screaming damaged heap like a superball.{{r|Royals #4}}

'''[[We-Plex Supreme Intelligence System (Earth-200080)|Plex]]:''' Out of all his equipment, Noh-Varr's most helpful is his spaceship's Living Database, Plex. Plex could telepathically give Noh-Varr information to help him complete his missions. Plex also had the ability to release an "Omniwave" which would allow him to control the thoughts/emotions of large groups of people. Plex died when S.H.I.E.L.D. took Noh-Varr into custody. While Noh-Varr had control of the Cube, he created a digital version of Plex, but it was destroyed by the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]]. Eventually recreating it and giving him over to [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan The Accuser]] in order to ease his own guilt, given that Noh-Varr could part with this means he has more than one of the A.I.{{r|Royals #6}}

After the desertion from the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]], Noh-Varr received a pair of Nega-Bands that were created just for him by the Supreme Intelligence. Their power levels thus far are vast with these bands Noh-Varr gains a new costume further enhancing his strength and durability enabling him to physically injure heavily armored opponents and survive most sorts of impact and trauma, teleport, emit concussive blasts able to belt wonder man, erect powerful force fields that can deter Ultron, avoid most all forms of detection, pick up trace energy signatures for analysis, project interactive projected holograms and fly at high speeds. These bands are also more technical than previous iterations for example they can transform into advanced mechanical pieces (notably larger than the bands themselves) to fabricate useful pieces of equipment and weaponry used for constructing transdimensional apparatuses or creating weapons which can stop a divine powered [[Robert Bruce Banner (Earth-10943)|Maestro]]. These new bands also seemed to bestow technopathic capabilities to him as well being able to commandeer multiple iron man armors from an alternate reality. Most recently they were destroyed when he turned on the Supreme Intelligence by [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan]].{{r|Avengers Vol 4 27}}
