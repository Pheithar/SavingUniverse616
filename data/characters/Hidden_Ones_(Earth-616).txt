===Origins===
Those who will became the Hidden Ones were the descendants of [[Inhumans (Race)|Inhumans]] living in the Great Refuge of [[Attilan]], but were distrust by their brethren, due to the powers of persuasion they all had.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}}

They consequently left Attilan, mating and blending among the [[humans]],{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}} living in peace in undiscovered mountains.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}}

Some legends and hatred circulated, and were eventually heard by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazis]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}}

In 1942, a Nazi expedition led by [[Erik Jaggar (Earth-616)|Erik Jaggar]] found them, and according to their orders, soon killed all of the adults and took the children to [[Berlin]] to be trained to follow orders. Jaggar was impressed by a [[Senso (Earth-616)|young girl with vertical eyelids and seemingly leading abilities]]{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} (her name being Senso).{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 53}}

In [[Germany]], they were trained, tortured as part of the [[Project Loki (Earth-616)|Project Loki]], but the instructors didn't manage to break them, the girl using her powers to resist to them, resulting in many casualties among the instructors.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 52}}

In Berlin in 1945, She witnessed the [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] burn to death [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Adolf Hitler]], with [[Thomas Raymond (Earth-616)|Toro]] as his witness. Along with her fellow Hidden Ones, they remained silent until the two [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]] left Hitler's bunker, and then left as well, witnessing the Nazi's defeat, the arrival of [[Russia]]n forces.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 53}}

Outside and free, they formed the pact of using their manipulation powers to infiltrate the power structure of the world and guarantee they would never be subjugated again, living in distrust of humans and hided from them, they would be the '''Hidden Ones'''.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 53}}

===The Hidden Ones===
The Hidden Ones spread in the positions of powers, causing a [[Clintonâ€“Lewinsky Scandal|scandal]] involving [[William Clinton (Earth-616)|Bill Clinton]], manoeuvring [[Karol Wojtyla (Earth-616)|John Paul II]] to cause schism in his ranks, and were even possibly involved in [[John F. Kennedy (Earth-616)|Kennedy]]'s assassination{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}}

Many of them infiltrated the US Government and military as lower level aides,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}} including Senso who eventually ascend into the US military, designing anti-aliens defense satellites and interrogating alien prisoners.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} 

===Return of the Inhumans===
As the [[Inhumans (Race)|Inhumans]] [[House of Agon (Earth-616)|Royal Family]] returned, exiled,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} the Hidden Ones acted in order to make them flee, fearing that the world would search for them then next, scanning them and figuring out that they were part Inhumans.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 53}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}}

Senso had mind-controlled [[Guardsmen (Earth-616)|Guardsmen]] attacking [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Benjamin Grimm]]{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 52}} and capturing him.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 53}}

Other Hidden Ones in the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|U.N.]] and in the media manipulated seemingly by telepathic suggestion and or mind-control the reactions of people in order to create defiance towards the [[House of Agon (Earth-616)|Inhuman Royal Family]] (who were exiled on Earth) and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] to thwart their efforts to protect aliens and Inhumans on Earth.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 52}}

They then had the Guardsmen attack the [[Baxter Building]] in order to took down both Fantastic Four and Inhumans. She then faced and took down the captured Thing, and soon afterwards [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]], revealing him her plan{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 53}} and history.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}}

The whole story was recorded by Reed's costume, and he was able to defeat her, only for her to escape.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}}

Soon afterwards, massive firings of lower level governmental and military aides were rumored, but those fired people were nowhere to be found.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}} It appears likely that the Hidden Ones still remains in some positions of power, waiting to strike.{{ref|Marvel Encyclopedia #Fantastic Four}}

==Appearances==
All of the Hidden Ones appears to have the same true appearance: bald, grey-skinned humanoid people with yellow cornea.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}} But (presumably) using their perception manipulation powers, they appeared as human-looking, sometimes with some distinctive aspects (nictitating membrane over the eyes/secondary eyelid closing vertically),{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} grey skin,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} eyes with no visible iris or pupils{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} (possibly only while using powers), feathered back and ankles wings,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} claws or talons,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} leathered back wings,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} pointed ears,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} green skin,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} reptilian figure and skin,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} scars or gills on the cheeks.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}}

It is unclear how much those forms were the results of their powers.

They also had glowing yellow while (and sometimes while not){{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 53}} using their persuasion powers.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 52}}

==Powers==
They are known to all possess "persuasion" powers,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}} and mind control,{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #Fantastic Four}} but they appeared to have other powers: Pyrokinesis,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} goekinesis,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}} winged or self-propelled flight.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 51}}

They have other powers related to their persuasion abilities, including seemingly telepathic blast or telepathic sharing of memories,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 53}} alter the perception of themselves to others.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #Fantastic Four}} and '''psionic force'''.{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #Fantastic Four}}

Senso was also able to disappear,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}} though it is unclear if she used her perception manipulation powers to render herself invisible or if she was able to teleport herself out.
