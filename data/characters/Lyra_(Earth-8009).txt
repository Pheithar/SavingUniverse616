===Origin===
The daughter of [[Thundra (Earth-715)|Thundra]] (the empress of the [[United Sisterhood Republic|United Sisterhood]]) and the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Incredible Hulk]],{{r|Hulk: Raging Thunder Vol 1 1}} Lyra was gifted with the strength of her parents and trained as an elite warrior for the Sisterhood in their fight against men,{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 1}} but, unlike the other gamma mutates, Lyra secretly grew weaker the angrier she got.{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 2}}

Lyra was called by the [[Gynosure (Earth-8009)|Gynosure]] to head a secret mission, one not even her select band of warrior compatriots were aware of. The Sisterhood's Cradle was malfunctioning, causing defective births, and without replacement circuitry it would be the end of the Sisterhood's ability to replenish their numbers, eventually leading to their extinction. Lyra was armed with [[Boudicca (Earth-8009)|Boudicca]], a wristwatch with an artificial intelligence linked to both the Sisterhood and Gynosure at all times, and sent to the Men's Cradle to steal the appropriate parts to repair their own Cradle.{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 1}} When a traitor turned on Lyra at the request of the Gynosure, the replacement parts were destroyed in their fight. Lyra returned to Gynosure to confront her for her treachery but was then sent to Earth-616, to seek out the great [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] and breed with him.{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 3}}

===Earth-616===
[[File:Lyra (Earth-8009) from All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Against A.R.M.O.R.]]
After arriving on [[Earth-616]], still armed with her wrist-worn companion, Boudicca, Lyra was engaged by [[Alternate Reality Monitoring and Operational Response Agency (Earth-616)|A.R.M.O.R.]] personnel who had detected her entry into this reality. Seeing themselves close to defeat, A.R.M.O.R. called for back-up in the form of gamma specialist [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|Jennifer Walters]], also known as the Sensational She-Hulk.{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 1}} They fought, but their confrontation was interrupted by the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]], who threw Jen from Manhattan to New Jersey and asked slightly arrogantly what it was Lyra sought from him, the Earth's mightiest male. As Lyra explained it was Norman Osborn she was after, he appeared (as the [[Iron Patriot]]) accompanied by his [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 2}} Lyra was captured, but Boudicca hacked into [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]]'s systems and released her, locking Osborn in a room with her.{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 3}} Lyra found herself disgusted by the idea of allowing what she viewed as Earth's greatest monster to ensure the survival of the future, and attempted to escape. As she was facing Norman's Avengers once more, Jennifer came to her rescue and the two were teleported away by A.R.M.O.R. Now safe from Osborn, Boudicca revealed she had located the manufacturing facility where the Cradle's macro processor was originally produced and sent one of the factory's automated robots to bury it for retrieval in the future. After the piece was dug up by the Sisterhood back on Earth-8009, Gynosure allowed Lyra to remain in the present and live in peace in search of her true place.{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 4}}

In exchange for some of Norman Osborn's stolen secrets, [[Charles Little Sky (Earth-616)|Director Little Sky]] gave Lyra a place among the ranks of A.R.M.O.R. rather than deport her to her home universe.{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 4}}

===A New Gamma Corps===
After Jennifer was a week late in visiting Lyra to continue her orientation to her new universe, Lyra was concerned for her mentor's whereabouts, but Little Sky was not interested in an official investigation of Jennifer's disappearance, as it was not A.R.M.O.R.'s concern. Lyra disobeyed him and left in a shock carrier with [[Alexander Erde (Earth-616)|Alexander Erde]], who confessed his feelings for her. On route to the first location of their investigation, they were ambushed by a trio of genetically enhanced women and they killed Alexander. The three women were then revealed to be the [[Gamma Corps: Black (Earth-616)|Gamma Corps: Black]], created by Osborn by taking inspiration from Lyra's tales about his Earth-8009 counterpart. The team intended to capture Lyra to be dissected and her organs harvested for research, but, motivated by Erde's death, she defeated the women one by one.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 601|605}}

[[File:Lyra (Earth-8009) from Fall of the Hulks The Savage She-Hulks Vol 1 3 001.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Wearing a stolen Fantastic Four costume]]
She proceeded to [[Gamma Base]], Death Valley, where she hoped to find clues towards Jennifer's whereabouts. However, she found no sign of Jennifer. She later joined the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]]'s [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]], hoping to find her, which proved to be a good decision, considering they were holding her in stasis in their [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier|Helicarrier]]. Lyra almost broke Jennifer free before being given a message from Banner to hold off on doing it until later. When Banner and other super heroes arrived at the base, he punched Lyra during the battle to allow her an excuse to go free Jennifer. She did as planned, but the two green heroines were attacked by [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Red She-Hulk]]. Jennifer tried to convince Lyra that Red She-Hulk was not a bad person but was thrown out of the Helicarrier by Red She-Hulk along with Lyra.{{r|Fall of the Hulks: The Savage She-Hulks Vol 1 1|2}}

[[File:Jennifer Walters (Earth-616) and Lyra (Earth-8009) from Fall of the Hulks The Savage She-Hulks Vol 1 3 001.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Fighting by Jen's side]]
When they hit the ground, they were faced with hordes of Hulked-out people, but they managed to handle the situation with the help of Red She-Hulk, who had only tossed them off the ship to prevent [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]] from catching them.{{r|Fall of the Hulks: The Savage She-Hulks Vol 1 3}}

===Banished===
Some time later, as part of [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Doc Green]]'s quest to rid the world of gamma mutations, he engaged Lyra in an attempt to send her back to her own reality. His A.I., [[Gammon (Earth-616)|Gammon]], took on a mind of its own, however, and deemed sending Lyra home to be an insufficient solution, instead choosing to send her to a hellish nightmare dimension. Doc Green vowed to find her and bring her home.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 11}}

[[Randall Jessup (Earth-616)|Randall Jessup]] and [[Daman Veteri (Earth-616)|Daman Veteri]], two of Doc Green's assistants, eventually located her and left to bring her back, only to find that she had conquered the dimension, declared herself Empress, and enslaved male demons into her own royal harem. All the males were subjugated, but the females of that dimension were allowed their freedom and embraced Lyra as their Empress due to the world no longer being the hellish nightmare it was back when the men ran it. Happy that she was happy and utterly impressed at her conquest, the pair decided to leave her alone. However, earlier they keyed their tech to teleport them and Lyra back upon physical contact. So as both complimented her with a high-five, they accidentally triggered the teleportation, returning Lyra to Earth-616. With her hands around their necks, she furiously demanded the two to find her dimension to send her back again, making them her slaves until they did.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 16}}

Still on Earth-616, Lyra was later approached by her mother, Thundra, who wanted to reconnect with Lyra after her time with the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-616)|Squadron Supreme]], which ended with the team disbanding. Thundra took her daughter to [[Weirdworld (Battleworld)|Weirdworld]] for them to have adventures together.{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 4 15}}

| Powers                  = '''Superhuman Strength''': In a completely calm state achieved via meditation, Lyra possesses incredible superhuman strength, being able to lift up to 100 tons. Lyra's strength has extended into her highly developed leg muscles, enabling her to leap great distances or heights. She is capable of leaping to a height of 600 feet and a distance of 1000 feet in a single bound.{{r|She-Hulks Vol 1 1}}

'''Superhuman Durability'''{{r|She-Hulks Vol 1 1}}

'''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Despite her body's extremely high resistance to injury, it is possible to injure her. However, she is capable of quickly rapidly regenerating injuries that result in great tissue damage and blood loss.{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 3}}

'''Gamma Sight:''' Lyra also has Gamma Sight which allows her to sense someone's weakness, gives her heightened senses, and allows her to fight in a trance state. This ability makes Lyra almost unstoppable.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 600}}

'''Symbiote-Repelling Pheromones:''' In Lyra's time, there is a great "black bloom", which is descended from the Venom symbiote. To counter this, scientists of Lyra's time genetically engineer all girls to emit pheromones, making them repulsive to the symbiotes. When Lyra encountered the [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Venom]] in the 616 universe, his symbiote recoiled and couldn't go near her.{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 4}}

| Abilities               = Lyra is the chief arms maiden of her tribe and was trained since childhood in the ways of combat. She has both extensive hand to hand abilities and can wield a variety of weapons with great proficiency.{{r|All-New Savage She-Hulk Vol 1 3}}

| Strength                = Class 90; while at a calm state Lyra can lift 90 tons, and up to 100 tons with meditation. However the angrier Lyra becomes the weaker she gets, her strength diminishes to the point where she can lift 10 tons.{{r|She-Hulks Vol 1 1}}

| Weaknesses              = To prevent Lyra from going into a destructive rage like her father, the engineers responsible for her abilities made it so she would get weaker the angrier she gets instead of stronger.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 600}}
