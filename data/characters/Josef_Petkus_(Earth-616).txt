| History                 = The fourth Red Guardian, Josef Petkus, was a special operative for the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union, and appeared as a member of the militant [[Supreme Soviets (Earth-616)|Supreme Soviets]]. Alongside the Supreme Soviets, he attacked the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers (Earth-616)|Soviet Super-Soldiers]] for defecting from the Soviet Union. Alongside [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], he later battled a bear-like creature composed of the [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]].{{r|Captain America #352|353}}

The Supreme Soviets later became known as the People's Protectorate after the fall of the Soviet Union.{{r|Soviet Super Soldiers #1}}

Alongside the People's Protectorate, he teamed with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] to battle the Peace Corpse, the Atlantean Army, and the Combine.{{r|Avengers #319|324}} They also battled the Hulk over a former Russian spy partly responsible for Banner's transformation.{{r|Incredible Hulk #393}}

The People's Protectorate eventually merged with the mutant vigilante unit called Siberforce, becoming the Winter Guard. Petkus was the overall leader of this unit, now calling himself the Steel Guardian.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #9|10}}

After the death of Darkstar, her brother Vanguard convinced Steel Guardian and most of their teammates to leave Russian service. Thye entered something known as the anomaly, which was really a portal to [[Limbo (Temporal)|Limbo]] and where forced to serve under [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]]. While fighting off [[Dire Wraiths]] in Limbo, they discovered that [[Fantasia (Earth-616)|Fantasia]] was actually a Dire Wraith all along. Steel Guardian was impaled in a battle against her forces.{{r|Darkstar and the Winter Guard #2}}
