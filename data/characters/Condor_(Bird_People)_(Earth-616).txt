| History                 = Condor was a brilliant member of the Bird People who wanted to become a crime lord. He found an amnesiac [[Xandarian]] known as [[Rieg Davan (Earth-616)|Powerhouse]] and tricked him into helping with his schemes.{{r|Nova #2}} He also recruited a criminal named [[Archibald Dyker (Earth-616)|Diamondhead]]{{r|Nova #3}} and brainwashed [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] into helping them. Together they fought the original [[Anath-Na Mut (Earth-616)|Sphinx]] and were defeated promptly. For his insolence Condor was turned into an actual Condor.

Years later [[Bird-Brain (Earth-616)|Bird-Brain]] of the Ani-Men used the [[Ani-Mator (Earth-616)|Ani-Mator]]'s machines to turn the Condor into a bird-like humanoid with more animal characteristics than he originally had. Condor once again came into conflict with Nova and was defeated.

| Powers                  =
'''Flight:''' Condor possesses the superhuman ability to fly by means of natural wings and are fully feathered like a bird's.

'''Aerial Adaptation:''' Condor's anatomy is naturally adapted to flying. His bones are hollow like a birds, making them weigh far less than usual for a human. His body is virtually devoid of fat and possess greater proportionate muscle mass than an ordinary human does. His eyes are specially adapted to withstand high-speed winds which would hurt the average human eye. He also possesses a special membrane in his respiratory system enabling him to extract oxygen from the air at high velocities or altitudes.<!-- Taken from Bird People, with some editing -->
