===Origin and Morlocks===
Litterbug comes from a military family where several generations had served in the armed forces.{{r|X-Men: Earth's Mutant Heroes Vol 1 1}}

'''Litterbug''', a mechanic in the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|US Army]],{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}} was employed in the construction of the giant mutant-hunting robot [[Sentinels]]. When his mutant powers manifested, he went AWOL.{{r|Morlocks #3}}

Eventually, he found his way into a small group of [[Morlocks (Chicago) (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] living under the streets of [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]]. Using his knowledge of [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] construction, Litterbug helped the Morlocks rig a Sentinel unit. They used it to infiltrate and destroy a local base. Subsequently, the group fled Chicago for parts unknown.{{r|Morlocks #1|4}}

===Post M-Day:Radicalized===
He later joined another group of Morlocks under the leadership of [[Masque (Earth-616)|Masque]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #487|491}}{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #2}}

===Utopia: Troublemaker===
Lead by [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]], Litterbug, [[Tamara Kurtz (Earth-616)|Dragoness]], and [[Bliss (Morlock) (Earth-616)|Bliss]] tried to seize some of the [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopian]] water supply under the mistaken assumption that they were hoarding due to a shortage. They were all stopped by [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]].{{r|Nation X #1}}

He was later seen on Utopia during the [[Second Coming]], alongside [[John Greycrow (Earth-616)|Greycrow]], [[Marshall Stone III (Earth-616)|Random]], [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]], and [[Sack (Earth-616)|Sack]] just as a [[Nimrod]] landed, ready to exterminate them.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 #14}} He survived and was an onlooker during the [[Evolutionaries]]' return.{{r|X-Men Vol 3 #12}}

A few months later he clashed with the members of [[Generation Hope]] after a [[Schism (Event)|major sentinel attack]]. He and others had been stirred up by [[Parul Kurinji (Earth-616)|Zero]].{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 15|17}}
