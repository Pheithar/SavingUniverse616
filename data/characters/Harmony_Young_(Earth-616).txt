===Luke Cage===
She first met [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke]] at his party for his time that he served at [[Seagate Prison]]. The party was at the penthouse suite of his lawyer, [[Jeryn Hogarth (Earth-616)|Jeryn Hogarth]]. The party was crashed by two criminal [[Stiletto]] and [[Discus]] burst into the penthouse and begin blasting the room with their weapons. Luke and [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]] tried to protect the guests, with Luke saving Harmony from one of the blasts.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist Vol 1 50}} The two begin dating not long after that even though She was as quite shallow and vain.
