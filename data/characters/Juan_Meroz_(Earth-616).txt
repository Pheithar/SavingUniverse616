| History                 = Juan Meroz, also known as El Tigre, was a hunter of ancient treasures. Escorted by two mercenaries, Ramon and Tuloc, he eventually found the Mayan pyramid of the god [[Kukulkán (Ahau) (Earth-616)|Kukulkán]] in [[Santo Rico]].{{Citation}}

When the [[Savage Land]] native [[Maa-Gor (Earth-616)|Maa-Gor]] was transformed into the Man-God, he took El Tigre as his servant. Meroz was exposed to the same mists that had changed Maa-Gor, but he was unable to bear his transformation and threw himself off a cliff.{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 #3|5}}
