Eelak was a member of the [[Crimson Cadre (Earth-616)|Crimson Cadre]] were an elite military force created by the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] [[Genetic Council (Earth-616)|Genetic Council]] following the self-exile of the [[House of Agon (Earth-616)|Inhuman Royal Family]] to Earth. Under the command of [[Ator (Inhuman) (Earth-616)|General Ator]], Eelak was a member along with the flying [[Margoyle (Earth-616)|Margoyle]], muck-man known as [[Glaboo (Earth-616)|Glaboo]], the electrically powered [[Pulssus (Earth-616)|Pulssus]], and the tree man known as [[Rootar (Earth-616)|Rootar]] among others. The first recorded mobilization of the Crimson Cadre came when the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] ventured to the moon to question the [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Watcher]] over his recent activities on Earth. General Ator demanded that the Fantastic Four be shot out of the sky due to their past assistance to the royal family in defying the Genetic Council. Although they lost track of the Fantastic Four's [[Stealth-Hawk]] ship, they were able to later track down the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] later on the surface of the moon outside the [[Watcher's Citadel]].{{r|Fantastic Four #398}} They ambushed the thing and nearly overpowered him until they were forced by by [[Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)|Kristoff Vernard]]'s retainer [[Artur Zarrko (Earth-6297)|Boris]] who threatened to unleash the Stealth-Hawk's weapons upon them. Ator ordered his troops to retreat, but vowed to get revenge against the Fantastic Four.{{r|Fantastic Four #399}}

Not long after this, the Watcher's citadel was swallowed up in a vortex accidentally activated by [[Nathaniel Richards (Earth-616)|Nathaniel Richards]], which threatened to destroy the Inhumans home of [[Attilan]]. This coincided with the sorceress [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]] raising the continent of [[Atlantis]] to the surface of Earth's oceans. Seeking to reclaim their ancestral home, the Genetic Council abandoned the Inhumans to their fate and went to Earth. Meanwhile, the Crimson Cadre discovered that a human was responsible and after arming themselves with an [[Atmo Gun]], traveled to Earth to get revenge against the human race, launching an attack in Florida. After the Cadre left Attilan, it was saved by the Fantastic Four, who shrunk it down to size and took it aboard their ship the Stealth-Hawk.{{r|Fantastic Four: Atlantis Rising #1}} The group were opposed by the members of [[Fantastic Force (Earth-616)|Fantastic Force]] who were able to disable the Atmo Gun and trap the Crimson Cadre within a [[Negative Barrier|Negative Zone Barrier]].{{r|Fantastic Force #8}} While the Crimson Cadre were imprisoned, the Genetic Council formed and alliance with Morgan, recovered the shrunken city of Attilan and forced the royal family back into their service. The Crimson Cadre were later rescued by [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]] and were part of the defensive trying to stop the Fantastic Four, Fantastic Force, the [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]] and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] from reclaiming Atlantis and Attilan. Ultimately, Attilan was restored to its normal size and contained under a Negative Zone Barrier.{{r|Fantastic Four: Atlantis Rising #2}} Trapped outside, the Crimson Cadre were ordered to apprehend the Inhuman Royal Family by the Genetic Council's ruler [[Arkadine Arcadius (Earth-616)|Lord Arcadius]], but failed.{{r|Fantastic Four Unlimited #11}}

Eventually, the Inhuman Royal Family came back into power, and while celebrating the return of [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]], the Crimson Cadre was enthralled by [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]] and his ally [[Fabian Cortez (Earth-616)|Fabian Cortez]] who tried to take down the royal family. The Cadre's ranks were increased with the addition of the renegade Inhumans [[Leonus (Earth-616)|Leonus]], [[Falcona (Earth-616)|Falcona]], and [[Stallior (Earth-616)|Stallior]]. The Cadre was easily dispatched and later Maximus and Cortez were quickly defeated.{{r|Quicksilver #6}} The Crimson Cadre has not been seen since, and has possibly been disbanded.

However, Eelak recently resurfaced as part of a strike-force put together by [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] and [[Gorgon Petragon (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] in order to free the cocooned Inhumans from the terrorist organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]].{{r|Inhumanity #2}} During this mission Eelak looked quite different from his time with the Crimson Cadre, however an explanation to these physical changes is not presently known.
