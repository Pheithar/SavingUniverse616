===Early Life===
Chris McCarthy was a low level S.H.I.E.L.D. agent working in the reconnaissance department on the [[Helicarrier]]. When Wolverine was brought in,<ref>following the events of "Enemy of the State"</ref> 

===Ant-Man===
Chris and his friend [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Eric O'Grady]], who he grew up with, were tasked with guarding Dr. [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]]'s lab by a higher ranking agent, [[Mitch Carson (Earth-616)|Mitch Carson]]. When Pym went to leave the lab, Eric and Chris panicked and Eric attacked Pym, knocking him unconscious.{{r|Irredeemable Ant-Man Vol 1 1}}

Inside the lab, they found the most recent version of [[Ant-Man's Suit]], which Chris put on and promptly activated, shrinking down. Thinking him gone, Eric panicked again and ran off. Chris promptly got lost in the Helicarrier, stuck at the 1-Inch size. Eric, meanwhile, took this opportunity to make a pass at Chris' girlfriend [[Veronica King (Earth-616)|Veronica King]], which the miniature Chris saw from an air vent.{{r|Irredeemable Ant-Man Vol 1 1}}

Around this time, a group of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] employed superhumans attacked the Carrier, and Chris and Eric were caught up in the ensuing chaos. Whilst trying to find a safe place to hide, Chris was killed, and Eric took Ant-Man's Suit off his body. Surviving the Helicarrier crash, Eric continued to work for S.H.I.E.L.D., using his evenings to explore the powers of his new suit.{{r|Irredeemable Ant-Man Vol 1 2|3}}
