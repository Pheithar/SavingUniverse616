[[File:Tania Belinskaya 2(Earth-616).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Belinskaya's original Red Guardian costume]]
Tania Belinskaya ('''Russian:''' Таня Белинская) is the daughter of Dr. Andrei Belinsky, a leader of a Soviet dissident movement that protested repressive policies of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]].{{r|Operation S.I.N. #2|4}}

As a child, Tania aspired to serve the greatest need of her country. Her ambition in life was to serve others, and no sacrifice was too great to achieve her goal. {{r|Defenders Vol 1 65}} Tania was secretly lonely. She never knew real friendship until she joined the ranks of the Defenders. {{r|Defenders Vol 1 65}}

At a young age, Belinskaya had already become one of the world's greatest and most renowned neurosurgeons. After her father was exiled to [[Siberia]] for his public denunciations of Soviet policies, Belinskaya decided to adopt a secret identity  in order to help other dissidents and to fight crime. Belinskaya named herself after the deceased [[Alexi Shostakov (Earth-616)|Red Guardian]] and took a similar costume.{{r|Defenders #35}} She was the third person to use the name.

[[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] obtained permission for Belinskaya to come to the United States to perform a complicated operation on [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]], returning his brain to his body after [[Arthur Nagan (Earth-616)|Gorilla-Man]] had removed it.{{r|Defenders #35}} Richmond was abducted from the hospital by [[Samuel Smithers (Earth-616)|Plant Man]], and Tania teamed up with the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] to help rescue him.{{r|Defenders #36|37}} She remained with the team for their battles against [[Nebulon (Earth-616)|Nebulon]]{{r|Defenders #38}} and the [[Headmen (Earth-616)|Headmen]],{{r|Defenders Annual #1}} helped free the [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] from prison,{{r|Defenders #39}} fought the [[Assassin (Cyborg) (Earth-616)|Assassin]] of the xenophobic Committee for Free Emigration,{{r|Defenders #40}} and helped rescue Nighthawk's former girlfriend [[Patricia Starr (Earth-616)|Trish Starr]] from [[Shazana (Earth-616)|Shazana]]'s control.{{r|Defenders #41}}

She was forced to return to the Soviet Union by Sergei Krylov, the [[Sergei Krylov (Earth-616)|Presence]]. Krylov was planning to transform himself and saw Tania as his ideal mate.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 #52}} He used his mind control on her, and after exposure to cobalt radiation and a nuclear explosion, both were transformed into beings of nuclear energy.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 #53}} The Defenders fought both of them until Tania was able to break Presence's mind control on her. Tania had herself placed on an isolated research facility to not harm others.{{r|Defenders #54|55}}

Tania was held in isolation in order to not irradiate other people. She dreaded the thought of a lifetime spent in solitary confinement. {{r|Defenders Vol 1 65}} The Soviet authorities informed Tania that the Presence returned to the '[[Khystym|Forbidden Zone]]' and apparently released a [[Giant Amoeba (Earth-616)| Giant Amoeba]]. Approaching the area was too dangerous for normal humans, so they asked Tania to take the mission and stop the Presence. Released from her cell, the Red Guardian discovered that the Amoeba was actually threatening the Presence's life. The two radioactive beings joined forces against the monster. Tania and Sergei discovered that they did have feelings for one another, and became a couple.{{r|Defenders #65}}

The two worked together against Professor Phobos, and then left the planet hoping to make themselves inert. The enigmatic [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]] found the two. They were later released by [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]].{{r|Quasar #14}}

Tania was attempting to keep Presence in check after a confrontation with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and the [[Winter Guard (Earth-616)|Winter Guard]].{{r|Avengers Vol 3 #41|43}}

The two eventually separated when Starlight joined the Winter Guard alongside the Presence's son, [[Nikolai Krylenko (Earth-616)|Vanguard]]. She then joined his splinter group, the [[Protectorate (Earth-616)|Protectorate]], looking for a way to bring Darkstar back to life. They got trapped in [[Limbo (Temporal)|Limbo]], where they discovered that one of their members, [[Fantasia (Earth-616)|Fantasia]] was actually a [[Dire Wraith]]. Fantasia then escaped back to Earth, where the Protectorate followed her. After encountering the current Winter Guard, they realized that they had to go back to the WInter Giuard's headquarters, where Fantasia was located to stop her from causing anymore damage. However, they were too late and Fantasia created a new Dire Wraith army with the help of Presence. They teleported into the base and attacked Fantasia, but were soon outnumbered, however,  [[Illarion Pavlovich Ramskov (Earth-616)|Powersurge]] and [[Red Guardian (Anton) (Earth-616)|Red Guardian]] managed to make a device capable of defeating the Dire Wraiths. [[Galina Nemirovsky (Earth-616)|Crimson Dynamo]] then boosted its signal, which created a tear in time that led to Limbo. Seeing that this tear could destroy the world, she threw Fantasia into the tear, but Fantasia latched onto to Starlight and dragged her into the tear. Tania's last words were "I will always love you" to Vanguard before the tear collapsed and killed them.{{r|Darkstar and the Winter Guard #1|3}}
