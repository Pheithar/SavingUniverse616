| History                 = [[File:Rupert Helona (Earth-616) from Nightstalkers Vol 1 4 001.jpg|thumb|left]] The man that would become known as Innards' life was a tragic one. He was murdered by an unknown assailant but was resurrected by a Voodoo priest. In his new undead form he had the ability to use his internal organs as weapons.{{r|Nightstalkers Vol 1 8}}

Innards was a member of the terrorist group known as [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]. He worked in the division known as the [[Department of Occult Armaments (Earth-616)|Department of Occult Armaments]], or D.O.A., along with [[Ayla Ranefer (Earth-616)|Rotwrap]], [[Alizon Baunacha (Earth-616)|Pyre]], [[Josef Pohlmann (Earth-616)|Malpractice]], and [[Gregory Belial (Earth-616)|Belial]]. One of Innards' first missions with the team was to execute three con artists: Madame Jasmine, Moorek, and Bronkson.{{r|Nightstalkers Vol 1 2}}

D.O.A. first encounters the [[Nightstalkers (Earth-616)|Nightstalkers]] when they track down team member [[Hannibal King (Earth-616)|Hannibal King]] to kidnap as the lab rat for their experiments. Hydra needed his blood to develop and army of [[Vampire|vampiric]] stormtroopers. They failed and he had to survive a fall from a hot air balloon. When the D.O.A returned to the Hydra base they were severely punished by [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron von Strucker]] for their failure.{{r|Nightstalkers Vol 1 3|4}} 

Later when Belial found a body recently bitten by a vampire, he taught Innards the art of Icthyomancy.{{r|Nightstalkers Vol 1 9}} Innards was also involved with the team when they stole [[Suze Harlow (Earth-616)|Suze Harlow]]'s body from her grave. He then worked with Rotwrap to take out [[Jeb Harlow (Earth-616)|Jeb Harlow]].{{r|Nightstalkers Vol 1 11}}

After [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Sin]] took over control of the D.O.A., Innards was part of a team that attacked [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]], lead by [[Brock Rumlow (Earth-616)|Crossbones]], to steal the hammers of the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]] that Valkyrie had collected. During the battle, Crossbones thought he saw Innards and Malpractice die and left without them. Innards managed to survive the fight but was tortured by Valkyrie, who threatened, ''"Do you think death can protect you from me?"''' Innards has not been seen since.{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless Vol 1 9|10}}
