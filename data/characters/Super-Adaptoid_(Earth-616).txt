===Origin===
Originally simply the Adaptoid, the Super-Adaptoid was created by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|Advanced Idea Mechanics]]. It was built using [[Unstable Molecules]] and incorporated a portion of a [[Cosmic Cube]] into its design.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 82}}

===First Mission===
On its first mission, the Adaptoid tried to replace [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. It initially disguised itself as [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Edwin Jarvis]], and drugged the hero's coffee, which caused him to hallucinate about his time in [[World War II]];{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 82}} however, the Adaptoid was then defeated by the [[John Robert Keane (Earth-616)|Tumbler]], who thought it to be the real Captain America.

The real Captain America managed to get loose and defeat the Tumbler, and tie both his doppelganger and the intruder, then call the police. After turning the Tumbler over to the authorities, Jarvis helped Captain America take the bound Adaptoid to [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Goliath]]'s lab until the other [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] returned,{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 83}} but while imprisoned it adapted to all the Avengers' powers and adopted a form that was an amalgamation of all the Avengers' forms. The transformed Super-Adaptoid then freed itself and resumed its mission to destroy Captain America.

The Super-Adaptoid attacked its target, soon overwhelmed the star-spangled hero, and then carried Captain America into the air in order to drop him to his death. After some resistance, Cap was unable to stop the android's ascension, but it still dropped him from a dangerous height into New York Harbor. Thinking Captain America was dead, the Super-Adaptoid returned to its masters; however, Cap had just barely survived his encounter thanks to the fact that he controlled his fall into the water.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 84}}

===Encountering the X-Men===
Believing it had killed Captain America, the Super-Adaptiod went into hibernation in [[Westchester County]]. Eventually the presence of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and [[Calvin Rankin (Earth-616)|Mimic]] revived it, but when it tried to scan the Mimic to gain all of the X-Mens' powers at once, their copying powers cancelled each other out and both lost their acquired powers.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 29}}

===Combating the Avengers===
Subsequent battles{{r|Avengers Vol 1 45}} against the Avengers{{r|Avengers Earths Mightiest Heroes Volume 2 4}} and [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] went poorly for the Super-Adaptoid.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 #49|51}}

When the Super-Adaptoid encountered [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], it copied his [[Nega-Bands]], thus gaining access to the [[Negative Zone]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 50}} Although it lost that battle, it later lured Captain America to the Negative Zone, but the Avengers, along with [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|the Thing]], captured it and imprisoned it beneath [[Avengers Mansion]].{{r|Marvel Two-In-One Vol 1 75}}

===Near-Omnipotence===
Later the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)#Masters of Evil IV|Masters of Evil IV]] invaded the mansion and accidentally released the Super-Adaptoid.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 277}} It changed its strategy and collected several other androids -- ([[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]], [[Sentry 459]], [[Draconus (Earth-616)|Dragon Man]], [[Awesome Android (Earth-616)|Awesome Andy]], and [[TESS-One (Earth-616)|TESS-One]]) -- to form the team [[Heavy Metal]].

They attacked the Avengers' [[Hydrobase]], but the Super-Adaptoid's ultimate goal was to find [[Kubik (Earth-616)|Kubik]], another product of a Cosmic Cube, and copy its powers. Almost omnipotent, it battled Captain America yet again, but could not overcome his indomitable will. Kubik eventually erased its new powers, removed the Super-Adaptoid's Cosmic Cube portion, and sent it back into hibernation.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 #286|290}}

===Targeting the Fantastic Four===
The [[Samuel Saxon (Earth-616)|Machinesmith]] briefly revived it,{{r|Captain America Vol 1 354}} before [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] appropriated the Super-Adaptoid and sent it after the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]. At the time, the Thing had lost his powers, so the Super-Adaptoid couldn't copy them, and with his mechanical substitutes, the Thing made short work of the android.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 336}}

===Recruited by the New Enforcers===
Later, the [[New Enforcers (Earth-616)|New Enforcers]] recruited the Super-Adaptoid to battle [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 #98|100}}

After another crack at Captain America,{{r|Avengers Vol 2 9}} the Super-Adaptoid battled the [[Heroes for Hire (Oracle Inc.) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]] and sustained heavy damage.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 1 7}}

===Repaired by the Incredible Hulk===
Next, crime boss [[Devlin DeAngelo (Earth-616)|Devlin DeAngelo]] bought the Super-Adaptoid, and forced [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] to repair it, apparently unaware of Banner's propensity to become the Hulk. After facing the Hulk, the Super-Adaptoid murdered DeAngelo.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 469}}

===Agent of the Phalanx===
The Super-Adaptoid eventually grew dissatisfied with [[Homo sapiens|humanity]] and left [[Earth]] to explore space. It came into contact with the [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]] and was infected with the [[Techno-Organic Virus|transmode virus]], before being made into a [[Selects (Earth-616)|Select]].

The Super-Adaptoid was tasked with tracking down the current Quasar, [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-616)|Phyla-Vell]], and assimilating her; however, the [[Kree]] evaded the machine, until it finally caught up to her by massacring a sect of the [[Priests of Pama (Earth-616)|Priests of Pama]].

Eventually, the Super-Adaptoid learned that Phyla was searching for the "savior" of the Kree who would oppose the Phalanx. It managed to trick Phyla into unleashing her quantum energy against it, enabling the Super-Adaptoid to create facsimiles of her [[Quantum Bands]] to follow the trail to the savior.

When the Super-Adaptoid arrived on the planet where the savior was regenerating, it began to assimilate him; however, the savior was actively fighting against the machine. Phyla arrived in time and fought the Super-Adaptoid, reabsorbing a portion of the quantum energy that was previously stolen from her. She then played upon the Super-Adaptoid's inability to imagine, and ultimately defeated it.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Quasar Vol 1 #1|4}}

===[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]===
[[File:Super-Adaptoid (Earth-616) from Spider-Women Omega Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]
The Super-Adaptoid returned to Earth and was encountered by the latest version of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]]. It was able to copy the powers of [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|the Human Torch]] before, on a whim, [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] touched it barehanded.

The Super-Adaptoid copied Deadpool's powers, but it also copied Deadpool's cancer and became overrun by the disease, killing the android's organic properties, an action that resulted in Wade being scolded for his reckless abandonment and leading Spider-Man to leave the team.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 1}}

Inspired by an attack from [[Super-Adaptoid (Earth-65)|Project Green]], [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Silk]] later took the Super-Adaptoid's remains to [[Earth-65]] where [[Reed Richards (Earth-65)|Reed Richards]] converted it into shape-shifting armor, which she wore into battle against [[Cindy Moon (Earth-65)|Cindy Moon]]; however, an EMP pulse from her [[Satan Claw|Power Glove]] fried the armor's circuitry, forcing [[Gwendolyn Stacy (Earth-65)|Spider-Woman]] to pry open the chest plate in order to free her.{{r|Spider-Women Omega Vol 1 1}}

===Robot Revolution===
The Super-Adaptoid resurfaced alive afterwards with a new form in the the wake of a pro-robots countermovement that emerged to fight the increased oppression suffered by artificial life forms across America by the hand of the government. During this conflict, the Super-Adaptoid joined the [[A.I. Army (Earth-616)|A.I. Army]], a consolidation of this countermovement dedicated to fighting for their cause, often through terroristic means.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 1}}

AIM continued to improve the Super-Adaptoid. It auctioned a new model at the Criminal Technology Expo in [[Las Vegas]], with a starting bid of $200 million. [[Hate-Monger (Earth-616)|Hate-Monger]] won the auction among several interested buyers.{{r|M.O.D.O.K.: Head Games Vol 1 2}}

| Powers                  = '''[[Power Mimicry]]:''' The Adaptoid could copy the powers, appearance, and equipment of any superpowered being in close proximity to it. It then became a duplicate of that being, visually indistinguishable from it.

Given the opportunity, it could copy up to eight different beings at one time, combining their attributes in a seemingly random fashion, but all those attributes turned green. For instance, the Super-Adaptoid had green variations of [[Captain America's Shield]], [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]'s chest medallions, and Iron Man's ribbed armor.

Bereft of the Cosmic Cube fragment that originally gave the android the means to duplicate powers, the manner by which it subsequently continued to copy superpowers was unknown.
