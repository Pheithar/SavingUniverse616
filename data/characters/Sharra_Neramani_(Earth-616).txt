===Origin===
Deathcry was a member of the [[Shi'ar]]. Her true name was taken by royal decree, and Deathcry was a dissident to the Shi'ar Empire, follower of [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]].{{r|Avengers #363}}

===Avengers===
When the Earth hero team [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] defeated the Shi'ar enemies, the [[Kree]], the empress [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Lilandra Neramani]] feared for the team's safety should the Kree attempt revenge. Lilandra then ordered Deathcry to join the Avengers as their protector.{{r|Avengers #363}} Deathcry served with the Avengers for several months, hiding her youth but she soon softened and revealed her true age as she formed close friendships with her teammates [[Vision]]{{r|Vision #1|4}} and [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]].{{r|Avengers #389}}

Later, after the Avengers survived a decimating attack by the villain [[Immortus]], Deathcry decided her services were no longer required. She bade Hercules to return her to the Shi'ar empire, where she remained for a time.{{r|Avengers #399}}

===Annihilation: Conquest===
At some point, she made her way into the Kree Galaxy, and following the overtaking of [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]] by the [[Phalanx]], she was discovered as a prisoner in a Kree rebel outpost. Placed on a commando team led by [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] and filled with other Kree prisoners, they were inserted on an unnamed world held by the Phalanx with the sole mission of destroying a Phalanx replication plant. While on this mission, she began threatening [[Gabriel Vargas (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]] for "taking her kills." After one such "theft", she made to attack Vargas, and in self-defense, he reduced her to a pile of bones and organs.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord #1|2}}

===Chaos War===
With the invasion of Earth's dimension by the entity called the Chaos King, Deathcry (along with other deceased Avengers [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], [[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Doctor Druid]], the Vision, [[Rita DeMara (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]], and [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|the original Swordsman]]), returned from the dead. When Mar-Vell was killed again by the [[Eric Williams (Earth-616)|Grim Reaper]], Deathcry inherited his cosmic awareness and became an enhanced version of herself as Lifecry. Although she managed to defeat [[Nekra Sinclair (Earth-616)|Nekra]], she also died in the end.{{r|Chaos War: Dead Avengers #1|3}}<ref name="Rama">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123075145/https://www.newsarama.com/6960-chaos-war-from-the-field-pak-van-lente-on-5-and-herc.html|title=CHAOS WAR: From The Field - PAK & VAN LENTE on #5 (And HERC)|work=Newsarama|first=Ching|last=Albert|date=2 February 2011|accessdate=}}</ref>

| Powers                  = Deathcry possessed various superhuman attributes that seemingly combined her avian Shi'ar physiology with mammalian features as well.

'''Superhuman Strength:''' Deathcry was superhumanly strong and possessed greater physical strength than the average member of her race. At her peak, she could lift approximately 2 tons.<br>

'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Deathcry's superior musculature produced less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of a human. While the full limits of her stamina isn't known, she could exert herself at peak capacity for at least several hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in her blood began to impair her.<br>

'''Superhuman Durability:''' Deathcry's bodily tissues, particularly her skin, were much more resistant to conventional physical injury than those of humans and most other Shi'ar. She could withstand high caliber bullets, exposure to temperature extremes, falls from great heights, and powerful impact forces without being injured.<br>

'''Superhuman Agility:''' Deathcry's agility, balance, and bodily coordination were all enhanced to levels beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.<br>

'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Her reflexes were similarly enhanced and were superior to those of the finest human athlete.<br>

'''Retractable Claws:''' Deathcry possessed a retractable, extremely sharp and durable claw at the tip of each finger. The natural edge of her claws, coupled with their durability and her strength, allowed her to rend most conventional materials including flesh, wood and stone. Deathcry's claws were also able to rend substances as durable as Omnium steel.<br>

'''Cosmic Awareness''': After the death of Mar-Vell, the Cosmic Awareness power gifted to him by [[Eon (Earth-616)|Eon]] chose Sharra as its new host, turning her into Lifecry.

| Abilities               = Deathcry was a skilled starship and aircraft pilot, claiming she'd first been taught her aviation skills at the age of 5. She was also an excellent armed and unarmed combatant and strategist, believed to have received training during time spent in the Shi'ar military.
| Strength                = 
| Weaknesses              = Deathcry was prone to berserker rages that made her reckless in combat situations. This reckless abandon is ultimately what caused her death.
