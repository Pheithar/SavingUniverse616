===Early Life===
'''Phil Urich''' was born and raised in [[New York City]], the son of [[Arnold Urich (Earth-616)|Arnold]] and [[Mindy Urich (Earth-616)|Mindy Urich]], Phil took to the wing of his uncle [[Benjamin Urich (Earth-616)|Ben]] who worked as a journalist with The [[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Daily Bugle]].{{r|Green Goblin #1}}

===Oscorp===
[[File:Goblin Formula from Green Goblin Vol 1 1 001.jpg|left|thumb|Exposure to the Goblin Formula]]
On a journalism assignment, Phil joined his uncle Ben in an investigation on [[Oscorp Tower]]. When his uncle was besieged by attackers in the building, Phil hid and tried to find help. Stumbling upon an experimental new [[Goblin Armor]], Phil also fell into a chamber of the [[Goblin Formula]]. Quickly dressing up in the suit, he scared off the hoods. Later on, he decided that the suit and equipment were worth using.{{r|Green Goblin #1}}

===Good Goblin===
After his discovery of the Goblin arsenal and equipment, Phil ran into [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and together took down [[Firefist (Earth-616)|Firefist]].{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #225}} He next met the [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]] and fought the [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]],{{r|Green Goblin #2}} the [[Jason Macendale Jr. (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin (Jason Macendale)]],{{r|Green Goblin #4}} [[Janice Yanizeski (Earth-616)|Joystick]],{{r|Green Goblin #3}} and others. Many were unsure of his purpose and motives as they were also curious about this new Goblin on the scene. He teamed up to battle threats from the [[Ultraverse]].{{r|UltraForce/Spider-Man Vol 1 1A|1B}}

It was not until a corrupt judge targeted Ben{{r|Green Goblin #5}} and sent the assassin [[Purge (Hit Man) (Earth-616)|Purge]] to kill him that Phil decided to take on his new persona with responsibility. Teaming up with [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], the pair was able to stop Purge.{{r|Green Goblin #6}}


This act gave the new hero a lot of attention and he developed a small but devoted following. [[Elizabeth Allan (Earth-616)|Liz Allan]] asked Ben for information on who was using [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|her husband]]'s former identity.{{r|Green Goblin #7}} She later gave Phil her "blessing" after he saved her and her son [[Norman Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Normie]] from [[Angelface (Earth-616)|Angelface]].{{r|Green Goblin #8}} He then went up against [[Jonathan Gatesworth (Earth-616)|Netshape]].{{r|Green Goblin #9|11}}

===Onslaught===
During [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]]'s attack, the Goblin costume was heavily damaged after battling the [[Sentinels]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #415}} Phil soon decided to retire as an active hero.{{r|Green Goblin #12|13}}

===Daily Bugle===
He began working at the [[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Daily Bugle]] as a full time reporter.{{r|Osborne Journals #1}} and continued to report on Spider-Man's adventures.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #422|433}}{{r|Spider-Man #98}}

===Excelsior/The Loners===
[[File:The Loners Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|left|thumb|"Excelsior"/"The Loners"]]
He left New York to join the Los Angeles Times. He formed [[Loners (Earth-616)|Excelsior]] as an outreach organization, a 'support group' for teen heroes and tried to help the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]].{{r|Runaways Vol 2 1|6}} 

The Team later changed their name to the Loners. However after a mental breakdown, Phil attacked [[Michiko Musashi (Earth-616)|Mickey Musashi]] and [[Christopher Powell (Earth-616)|Chris Powell]], stealing the [[Darkhawk Amulet]] and giving in to his psychosis. Afterwards, Phil was depowered, but escaped with [[Hollow (Earth-616)|Hollow]].{{r|The Loners #1|5}}

===Hobgoblin===
[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 649 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hobgoblin]]
In [[New York City|New York]], Phil helped out his uncle at the new [[Daily Bugle (Front Line) (Earth-616)|Front Line]] offices.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #648}} Having a crush on his co-worker [[Norah Winters (Earth-616)|Norah]], who was looking into "Goblin gangs" for a story, Phil ran off to one of the old Goblin hideouts, hoping to find something there to impress her with. Phil encountered and murdered [[Daniel Kingsley (Earth-616)|Daniel Kingsley]], the twin brother of [[Roderick Kingsley (Earth-616)|Roderick Kingsley]], who was Hobgoblin at that time. After killing him, he became the '''Hobgoblin'''. Operating as a supervillain, he attacked a local think tank, and was confronted by [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]]. Catching the hero off-guard with his Goblin laugh, Phil attempted to decapitate him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #649}} One of the think tank workers was able to disrupt the sonics to save Spider-Man, but Phil escaped with the experimental metal he came to steal. He delivered the metal to the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] and became one of his operatives.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #650}} Spider-Man and [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] fought Phil and the Kingpin to retrieve the experimental metal. During the fight, Phil's "Lunatic Laugh" caused the building to collapse, and he saved the Kingpin from falling to his death.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #651}}

[[File:Phillip Urich (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 649 0001.jpg|thumb|left|280px||Urich kills Daniel Kingsley]]
Phil gave Norah tips about possible Hobgoblin sightings so they could watch together in an attempt to woo her away from [[Randolph Robertson (Earth-616)|Randy Robertson]]. Phil was jealous of Randy for dating Norah, so when [[Alistaire Smythe (Earth-616)|Alistaire Smythe]]'s minions attacked the Front Line offices Phil broke a support beam. This, along with the damage caused by the attack, caused the ceiling to collapse on Randy. Randy survived the collapse, but he was seriously injured.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #654}} Phil, as the Hobgoblin, fought [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] after he defeated a gang that worked for the Kingpin. His pumpkin bombs caused debris to fall on Hercules, but he managed to escape the rubble. He then resumed the fight as Hobgoblin filmed the fight with hidden cameras which aired the footage live. Hercules won the fight, ironically boosting his popularity, instead of Phil's as he originally hoped. The Kingpin managed to convince Hercules not to hand him over to the authorities.{{r|Herc #1|2}} Phil attacked [[Anya Corazon (Earth-616)|Spider-Girl]] after Norah talked about how impressive she was and he wanted to show her that he, as the Hobgoblin, was more impressive. He lured her to him by leaving a destructive path for her to follow. As the fight ensued, Spider-Girl was on the verge of defeating him. However, Spider-Man saw what she was doing and since he thought that she was still too inexperienced to fight such a powerful opponent, decided to intervene. However, by doing this, he only caused the Hobgoblin to get away.{{r|Spider-Girl Vol 2 6}} Phil finally broke up Randy and Norah through stalking and a confrontation with the couple in his Hobgoblin persona. Norah then kissed Phil shortly after, knowing exactly what to say to seduce her unbeknownst to her, having instigated the break up.{{r|Spider-Island: Deadly Foes #1}}

Under orders from the Kingpin, Phil teamed up with Spider-Girl to fight the [[Sisterhood of the Wasp (Earth-616)|Sisterhood of the Wasp]] during "[[Spider-Island (Event)|Spider-Island]]".{{r|Spider-Island: The Amazing Spider-Girl #1|3}} Phil infiltrates a prisoner transport headed to the [[Raft]] to kill the [[Richard Deacon (Earth-616)|Human Fly]] for stealing money from the Kingpin, but [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]] is on the transport and they fight. Agent Venom and Phil fight to a stalemate and the Human Fly escapes during the fight.{{r|Venom Vol 2 16}}

During a confrontation with Spider-Man, Hobgoblin used a weapon designed to disrupt Spider-Man's spider-sense. Although it initially appears to have failed, Peter later realized that it had caused his spider-sense to become intense, reacting to the most minor of threats. Peter's dazed mental state, along with a wrongly delivered message from [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Madame Web]], allowed Phil to capture him while him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #695}}
Peter later found out that Phil and the Kingpin did not know his secret when Phil proclaimed him "Peter Parker, Spider-Man's best friend". Phil and the Kingpin tried to get Peter to tell them who Spider-Man was but failed. Meanwhile Roderick Kingsley dressed in his old costume to go searching for him. When Kingsley engaged Phil, [[Max Modell (Earth-616)|Max Modell]] got in the way and helped Peter escape. Peter used his web shooters to break the disruptor weapon and escaped. Kingpin then orders the two Hobgoblins after him. Both the Hobgoblins ended up fighting Spider-Man but ultimately gave up as Roderick Kingsley decided to just kill Urich instead. He then changed his mind at the last moment, letting him stay as the Hobgoblin, but only if he gave Kingsley a cut of the profits he made. Reluctant, Phil agreed to the arrangement but quickly began to conspire to kill Kingsley so that he wouldn't get in his way.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #697}} When [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|Mayor Jameson]] announced an effort to crackdown on super-villains, Phil debated if it was still worthwhile to be the Hobgoblin because he payed so much to the [[Phineas Mason (Earth-616)|Tinkerer]] for his Hobgoblin gear and to Kingsley for being allowed to be the Hobgoblin.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #6}}

===Monstrous Chivalry===
While receiving his weapons enhancement from the Tinkerer, his apprentice [[Tiberius Stone (Earth-616)|Ty Stone]] messes with the technology, as vengeance from his mistreatment. Phil later showed his video of [[Shadowland]]'s destruction, receiving congratulations and a paycheck from [[Joseph Robertson (Earth-616)|Robbie]]. Behind on his payment from Kingsley, Kingsley suggested that Phil steal as much money to clear him of his payments; causing Phil to start a chain of bank robberies and earning the [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Superior Spider-Man]]'s ire. While fighting the Superior Spider-Man, Ty tampers with the technology so that Spider-Man may beat Phil. Phil manages to escape and frantically rushes into the Daily Bugle demanding another paycheck from Robbie. Spider-Man then activates the spider-tracer he placed on Phil, and tapped into every TV screen in the city and revealed Phil's identity as the Hobgoblin.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #15}}

With his identity as Hobgoblin revealed to the public, Phil realizes he has nowhere to run and desperately makes excuses as his Daily Bugle co-workers turn against him. Superior Spider-Man learned of Phil's location and arrived at the Daily Bugle and fought with a manic Phil bringing the fight outside where Superior Spider-Man disarms him. He pondered about giving Phil a public execution, but Phil is freed from a prison transport by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]] who upgrades his armor and weapons. Green Goblin asked only for full dedication to Phil's only and new identity as the "Goblin Knight" which he accepts.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #16}}

[[File:Phillip Urich (earth-616) 001.jpeg|thumb|right|Rise of the Goblin Knight]]
He would later prove his loyalty by disposing of the body of [[Hobgoblin (Claude) (Earth-616)|Kingsley's impostor]] when he died in a fight with Norman.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #26}}

Following downfall of Norman, Urich became the new Goblin King, take the lead of the Goblin Nation remnants, which became one of the main organized crime powers in New York. He called upon two other crime powers, [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mister Negative]]'s criminal empire and the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] fraction lead by the [[Edward Lavell (Earth-616)|Eel]], to divide the criminal underground. While waiting for the Eel, they were surprised to see him crashing in from a window. They were confronted by the [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]], who demanded the Eel's part. Negative refused, saying that she only had reputation until it was destroyed by the Spider. She claimed that they were all outed by Spider-Man, but that she will be successful in defeating him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 5}} 

===AXIS===
In order to prove his worth as the new '''Goblin King''', Urich began hunting for [[Roderick Kingsley (Earth-616)|Roderick Kingsley]], who had returned to New York and enfranchised his Hobgoblin persona and those of deceased or retired superheroes. Executing a Hobgoblin impostor, Urich mused on his failed attempt to save [[Elizabeth Hollister (Earth-616)|Lilly Hollister]] after her arrest.{{r|AXIS: Hobgoblin #1}} 

To get Kingsley's attention, Urich attacked a building with children playing inside. As he expected, [[Roderick Kingsley]] did arrive to save the children, as he had recently been inverted due to the [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|inversion spell]]. After a short battle, Urich realized how distracted Kingsley was. Instead of fighting, he told him to buy his new book about becoming a superhero before fleeing.

Urich later confronted Kingsley at the latter's headquarters, remarking that Kingsley was insane. Urich attempted to kill Kingsley, but was soon confronted by Lily Hollister. She had amnesia, and had joined Kingsley's cause and taken the alias of the "Queen Cat." Urich battled some of Kingsley's leased superheroes before being forced to escape through the window, leaving the message "Find Me Lily."

Back to his base, Urich was visited by [[John Myers (Earth-616)|John Myers]], one of Kingsley's leased heroes (aka Missile Mate), who stepped out and wanted to be a villain. Urich was reluctant on inviting him to his army, which was being formed by half of the leased villains Kingsley had abandoned, however, Myers revealed he had allied himself with the other half of those leased villains.{{r|AXIS: Hobgoblin #2}}

Urich was visited in his base by the Queen Cat, who had agreed to double-cross Kingsley. During a celebration being held for the declaration of Hobgoblin Day, Missile Mate failed to kill Kingsley, which prompted Urich and the Goblin Nation to jump into action. Even though he was bested in combat by Kingsley, Urich expected the Queen Cat to betray the Hobgoblin. However, Lily revealed to have merely pretended to have any regard for their past relationship, and stated that having forgotten her criminal life might have been a gift she wasn't going to waste. After a failed attempt by the Missile Mate to escape with Urich, the Goblin King and the members of the Goblin Nation present at the scene were taken into custody.{{r|AXIS: Hobgoblin #3}}

===Death===
[[File:Philip Urich (Earth-616), Norman Osborn (Earth-616), and Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 797 0001.png|thumb|right|Norman Osborn kills Urich using the Carnage symbiote]]
Urich later resurfaced again during Alchemax's representation of new energy source, trying to steal it. Even though Spider-Man and [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Anti-Venom]] appeared and defeated his henchman, Urich managed to escape using his sonic scream.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #796}} Not long afterwards, he searched for new weaponry in one of Osborn's old caches. He happened to break into Norman's abandoned Upper East Side club where he was holding [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]] hostage. Osborn caught notice of Urich's presence in the lower levels of the building, and confronted him. Unaware of Norman's [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|new symbiote]] and the return of his goblin powers, Phil attacked him with his sword. Norman stopped the attack and killed Phil by impaling his chest with his symbiote blades.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #797}}

| Powers                  = '''[[Goblin Formula]]:''' Much like the [[Green Goblin]], the Goblin Formula gave Phil superhuman powers.{{r|Marvel Legacy: The 1990s Handbook #1}}
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' Phil became super-strong. Coupled with his armor which further augmented his abilities, he was strong enough to at least match Spider-Man's strength. He can lift approximately 8 tons.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12}}
* '''Superhuman Speed:''' Phil can run and operate at superhuman speeds.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12}}
* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Phil's body produces less fatigue toxins, allowing him to work at peak capacity for several hours before fatigue begins to wear him down.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12}}
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' Phil's body tissues, skeletal and musculature structure were enhanced by the Goblin Formula, making it more stronger than any human beings. He is durable enough to survive punctured and gunshot wounds, blunt force traumas, powerful impacts (e.g., falls from great heights) and being struck by another superhumanly strong opponent.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12}}
* '''Healing Factor''': It is still possible for Phil to sustain injury. If he does, his body's augmented chemical composition allows him to heal damaged tissue much faster and more extensively than a normal human is capable of. While not as efficient as other superhumans', he can heal from injuries from a matter of days that would prove lethal to an ordinary human. Roderick's regenerative ability is considered greater than Osborn's, thus giving him an immunity to all sorts of radiation, toxins, forms of aging factors and diseases.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12}}
* '''Superhuman Agility and Reflexes:''' Hobgoblin's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete. His reflexes are similarly enhanced and are superior to those of the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12}}
* '''[[Acoustikinesis|Lunatic Laugh]]''': Unlike the Green Goblin, Phil developed a sonic attack he called the ''Lunatic Laugh.'' Initially thought to be part of the mask, the laugh seems to be an actual power of Phil's.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12}}
** '''Lunatic Laugh resistance:''' Phil seems to be immune to his Lunatic Laugh. It's unknown, if he is immune to other sonic attacks too.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12}}
| Abilities               = '''High Intellect:''' Though inferior when compared to Osborn or Kingsley, Phil is actually very intelligent. He was able to outsmart the Kingpin on at least one occasion, and has repeatedly escaped capture from both superheroes and the law. He has also proven to be a highly efficient criminal strategist and organizer as the Goblin King.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12}}
| Strength                = It is shown that he is inferior when compared to Norman Osborn, but he was able to match Roderick Kingsley.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12}}

| Equipment               = '''[[Goblin Armor]]:''' The Goblin's costume incorporated chain mail in the tunic, giving him further protection from high impacts, such as the punches or kicks inflicted during his battles with [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #12}}
* '''Goblin Mask:''' The Goblin Mask causes a chemical reaction with the Goblin formula, giving Phil superhuman strength and durability while wearing it.{{r|Green Goblin #1}}
* '''Goblin Gloves:''' The gloves contains finger blasters which could shoot electricity or a blinding flash.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #225}}
* '''Goblin Boots:''' The Goblin costume's boots have small jets that let him hover, although he mainly used the Glider for transportation.{{Citation}}

'''[[Goblin Glider]]'''{{r|Web of Spider-Man #125}}
* '''Glider Cam:''' A camera fixed onto the nose of the Goblin Glider.{{Citation}}
| Transportation          = '''Flight:''' Wings;{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #649|650}} Formerly Goblin Glider, Goblin Boots.
