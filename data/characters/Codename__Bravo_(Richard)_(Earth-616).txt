| History                 = A Super Soldier from the 1920s and '40s, Codename: Bravo was part of a team built by [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] along with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Margaret Carter (Earth-616)|Peggy Carter]], [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum-Dum Dugan]] and [[Jimmy Jankovicz (Earth-616)|Jimmy Jankovicz]] to attack [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]. However, Bravo grew to hate Captain America, as Peggy preferred Steve over him. After Jimmy used his powers to open a portal to [[Nowhere]] (a dimension different from ours), a [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] agent bashed Jimmy's head in, rendering him comatose, and trapping Bravo along other soldiers in Nowhere.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 4}}

===Return with a Vengeance===
After many years trapped in [[Nowhere]], he was able to escape when Jimmy waked from coma, and started working with [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] and Hydra to destroy Captain America, blaming him for his accidental imprisonment, as well taking Peggy Carter from him. This resulted in Bravo using a machine connected to the again-catatonic Jankovicz to enter [[Nowhere]], where he trapped Captain America, and proclaimed himself king of this dimension.

[[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Agent 13]], [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] and [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] rescued Captain America with the help of Jimmy's last act of will and Bravo was imprisoned. 

===Captain America: Powerless===
Under [[Hydra Queen (Nowhere) (Earth-616)|Hydra Queen's]] orders, [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]], along with Hydra soldiers, freed Bravo from the [[Raft]]. He joined them in a plot to unleash mobile, "Omega"-class [[Madbomb|Madbombs]] upon America, but when a gunshot from the Hydra Queen ricocheted off of Captain America's shield and struck him. Richard along with [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Zemo]] were taken into captivity.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 18}}
