| History                 = Fabio Medina was one of the numerous new [[Homo superior|mutants]] whose powers manifested after the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|war]] between the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].

His powers manifested after he was a victim of a robbery attempt, as he explained to the police. The [[San Diego]] police officers attempted to put him into custody, but they were interrupted by [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and his group of [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] who showed up at the scene to rescue Fabio.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 1}}

After the X-Men and Fabio together fended off a squad of various sized [[Sentinels]], the X-Men offered Fabio a place on their team. He was reluctant at first, but eventually determined that he preferred to join rather than to remain in San Diego.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 2}}

He was with the team of X-Men that visited [[Eva Bell (Earth-616)|Eva Bell's]] home and encountered the Avengers before being transported into [[Limbo]] during [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu's]] attempted attack.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 5|6}} After they escaped, Fabio demanded to be taken home.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 7}} His family questioned his disappearance and did not believe or understand that he was a mutant.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 8|9}}

[[File:Fabio Medina (Earth-616) from Spider-Man Vol 2 3 001.jpg|thumb|left|Fabio in civilian clothes]]
He later lost control of his powers and [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Agent Dazzler]] of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] arrived to question him about Cyclops' location. He was taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody before being rescued by Cyclops' team, joining them once more. He later assisted in the battle against the [[Sentinels|Blockbuster Sentinel]] by concentrating the emission of his gold balls to topple the Sentinel.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 9}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 10}} It was upon this occasion that he took on the nickname '''Goldballs'''.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 11}} Although he had thought himself and his powers ridiculous, Goldballs and his battle cry "GOLDBALLS!" became a media sensation until the world realized that he was a mutant.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 35}}.

Fabio later moved to New York where he attended school with [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Miles Morales]] and [[Ganke Lee (Earth-1610)|Ganke Lee]] at [[Brooklyn Visions Academy]] for a while.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 2 3}}{{r|Champions Vol 2 24}}

Fabio moved to the sentient mutant island of Krakoa following the foundation of a sovereign mutant nation in its territory by the hand of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]], [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], and [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira X]]. While there, it was discovered that his namesake gold balls were actually biological infertile "eggs," which if made fertile, could allow for potentially unlimited resurrection of the mutant race. As such, he became a member of [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]], who kept the mutant population of Krakoa alive even after death. With the rest of The Five he was considered as something sacred to be treasured because, together, the five mutants were able to actually create new clones of the deceased, restoring their bodies, powers, and memories as they were at the time of their deaths.

Xavier tasked the Five with resurrecting [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]], [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]], [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]], [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Penance]], [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] who died stopping the creation of Nimrod.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}} The Five had previously resurrected other long deceased mutants, such as [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], and [[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]] and [[Esme Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Esme Cuckoo]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}} As a result of the developments surrounding his powers, Fabio changed his codename to Egg.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 1}}

| Powers                  = '''Sphere Generation''':[[File:Fabio Medina (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 11 001.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Goldballs shooting out his golden balls.]] Fabio is a [[Homo superior|Mutant]] whose powers manifest by the production of gold balls of different sizes from any part of his body, emitting the sound "Poink" each time they hit something. The balls seem to be able to bounce.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 1}}

It was discovered that the "gold balls" Fabio produces are actually infertile eggs. In conjunction with the group known as [[Five (Earth-616)|the Five]], Fabio forms a key part of Krakoa's ability to revive dead mutants.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}
