When [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] split from [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and returned to New York, he planned to build a new school. Naming this the [[Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]], he opened it up to any mutant who would come with him. Secretly, the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] had placed Krakoa on the campus, and the school was built atop it.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men #2}}

The Hellfire Club had Krakoa attack the school. When this happened, [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Kid Omega]] accessed his mind and discovered his origins. He had Krakoa open up to [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Marvel Girl]], who relayed his apologies to Headmaster Wolverine. Krakoa told her that he was a mutant and asked to join the X-Men. He was allowed to stay as Logan found it good to have a school grounds which can fight back.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men #3}}

Krakoa was the solution for the school's money woes, as he could grow diamonds on trees.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men #7}}
