| History                 = 
===Origin===
Icemaster's origins are a mystery and the source of his [[Glossary:Cryokinesis|cryokinesis]] remains unrevealed.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #5}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #Fantastic Four}}

===First Exploit===
Seeking to create another ice age, the Icemaster had frozen much of [[New York City]], only to face the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and was defeated<ref group="See Comment">The appearances in Hostess Fruit Pie adverts was initially uncertain whether the stories were canon to [[Earth-616]]. When Icemaster later appeared on Earth-616 the OHoTMU's profile on Icemaster canonized the adverts (sans mentioning Hostess). {{cl|Spider-Verse Vol 1 1}} had an appearance of a [[Peter Parker (Earth-51914)|Spider-Man]] who attempted to feed [[Morlun (Earth-001)|Morlun]] an unidentified snack cake before being killed. This reality was assigned to [[Earth-51914]] and the [http://www.marvunapp.com/master/earthteaz.htm Master List] of Universe designation notes: "Represents reality where the stories shown in Hostess cake ads took place as actually shown (specifically with the Hostess products influencing/motivating the heroes and/or villains)". It is unknown if this is a full retcon of the appearances. Since several characters including Icemaster appeared on 616 it is the wiki's current stance that the adverts depicted occurred on Earth-51914 but events similar to the advert's happened on Earth-616 just without the involvement of snack cakes.</ref>.{{r|Avengers #191}}

===Masters of Evil===
One of twenty-five villains who joined the second [[Justine Hammer (Earth-616)|Crimson Cowl]]'s [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]], Icemaster and the other Masters planned to extort billions from the world's governments through their weather-control technology, but their base was infiltrated by the Thunderbolts. The Icemaster, along with the Masters of Evil, was beaten by the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] and jailed.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 #24|25}}

===Fear Itself===
[[File:Bradley Kroon (Earth-616) from Avengers Academy Vol 1 20 001.jpg|left|thumb|100px|De-powered]]
Eventually imprisoned in the [[Raft]], he later escaped when [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] became possessed by the Asgardian entity [[Kuurth (Earth-616)|Kuurth]] and destroyed the prison.{{r|Thunderbolts #158}}{{r|Herc #3}} Escaping through a New England town alongside [[Danielle Blunt (Earth-616)|Aftershock]], [[Jason Pierce (Earth-616)|Ember]], and [[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Whirlwind]], they were opposed by [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Speedball]]. When angry townsfolk attacked Speedball, thinking his departure would cause the villains to leave more quickly, the villains made their escape.{{r|Fear Itself: The Home Front #2}} Following the conclusion of the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]]'s attack on Earth, Speedball gathered his fellow [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]] staff members, along with the students, and confronted Icemaster, Aftershock, and Ember. While the group had the villains on the ropes, it was ultimately the arrival of industrialist [[Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616)|Jeremy Briggs]] that led to the defeat of the villains.{{r|Avengers Academy #20}}

Later incarcerated in an up state [[New York (State)|New York]] prison not designed to handle superpowered individuals, Icemaster was part of a large riot amongst the powered prisoners, including [[John Horton (Earth-616)|Griffin]], [[Chip Martin (Earth-616)|Schizoid Man]] and [[Edward Lansky (Earth-616)|Lightmaster]]. Initially opposed by a contingent of [[Guardsmen (Earth-616)|Guardsmen]], the villains were ultimately stopped by the only heroes able to respond to the incident: the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] and [[Calvin Rankin (Earth-616)|Mimic]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy #275}}
