===Early Life===
Adam Brashear was born and raised in [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]], [[Illinois (State)|Illinois]]. From an early age it was realized that Adam was a child prodigy.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #1}} Adam was a former fullback at [[Cornell University]] who graduated magna cum laude. Adam had Ph.D.s. in electrical engineering and theoretical physics.{{r|Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel #1}}

[[File:Korea (Region) from Ultimates Vol 3 4 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]
===[[Korean War]]===
Adam was a veteran of the [[Korean War]], a member of the [[United States Marine Corps (Earth-616)|US Marine Corps]] with two Silver Stars. While in the Marine Corps Adam met [[Conner Sims (Earth-616)|Conner Sims]], the friend he would later know as Anti Man.{{r|Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel #1}}

===Project: Perseus===
Adam later became the project lead on a scientific attempt to harness Anti Matter through the creation of a"Negative Reactor which created a bridge between the [[Negative Zone]] and the positive matter universe itself.{{r|Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel #1}}{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 4|, the project is revealed to be in the research facility Project: Pegasus.}}

This reactor would then allow for an almost unlimited source of clean energy by allowing devices to tap the energy generated by a stable event horizon balanced between these positive and negative universes. Due to the unexpected explosion of the reactor, both Adam and Connor were subjected to mutagenic radiation generated by the then unstable event horizon. While Sims' body disassembled into energy, Brashear became a stable antimatter reactor and developed a set of superhuman abilities.{{r|Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel #2}}

===Blue Marvel===
In 1962 Adam received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President [[John F. Kennedy (Earth-616)|John F. Kennedy]] on the day the President asked him to retire; it had been discovered by the public that he is an African American. As the Blue Marvel, Adam wore a full face helmet, but when it was damaged in a battle, Adam's identity was revealed. A massive controversy ensued as the America of 1962 was too racist to accept a black super man. The President reluctantly decided to ask Adam to step back. Torn between myriad considerations, the Blue Marvel conceded.{{r|Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel #3}}

At some point, Adam studied a mysterious being called the [[Infinaut (Earth-616)|Infinaut]] who made various attempts to manifest on Earth.

Adam came back for one final mission and defeated the herald of an alien armada bent on enslaving the Earth. After that fight, Adam left the Medal of Freedom in the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], where he first met [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu the Watcher]]. Adam's conversation with the Watcher was interrupted by the late arrival of the alien armada and Adam defeated them. The United States Government used this final mission to fake his death. The government later set up [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agent Marlene Frazier as Adam's monitor under the cover name Candace. Marlene eventually became Adam's lover, his wife and the mother of their two children. Adam later became a tenured professor of physics at the University of Maryland.{{r|Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel #4}}

===Mighty Avengers (1970's)===
[[File:Mighty Avengers (1970s) (Earth-616) from Mighty Avengers Vol 2 12 001.jpg|thumb|right]]
In November 1972, Adam joined an earlier version of the [[Mighty Avengers (1970s) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]] a team formed by different people who came across each other while investigating the murder of a were bat.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 11}} When [[Bear (Hybrid) (Earth-616)|The Bear]] revealed the [[Vampires|Deathwalkers]] led by [[Lichidus (Earth-616)|Lichidus]] were behind this, the team officially formed to take them down. [[Kaluu (Earth-616)|Kaluu]] tracked down the black magic used in the were bat to a secret subway station below the City Hall. The Mighty Avengers then attacked the Deathwalkers before they could make their sacrifice. After [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]] recovered the Talisman of Kamar Taj, which was required to perform the sacrifice, Adam caused the subway to collapse above the Deathwalkers. With the Deathwalkers stopped, the team disbanded.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 12}} 

===Infinaut's Return===
In the Infinaut's second manifestation in 1998, Adam and his son [[Kevin Brashear (Earth-616)|Kevin]] used an anti matter powered rig to interrupt it. Adam discovered that if Infinaut had manifested on Earth at his large size, he would've destroyed it.{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 9}}

===Anti-Man===
Connor Sims, the Anti Man, was a radical who, partly because of his history with Adam Brashear, violently hated racism, and in his power fueled insanity sought to eradicate it, and probably humanity right along with it. When Anti Man returned and defeated the [[Mighty Avengers (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Avengers]], [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] tracked down Adam and with the help of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] they come up with a plan to stop Anti Man. After a surprise confrontation with Connor on the moon, Adam was left unconscious. Later an extended fight with Anti Man resulted in Adams death. At the conclusion of their battle, Adam took Anti Man up to the edge of the ionosphere and siphoned off his remaining  anti matter energy  which caused his waveform to permanently decohere and collapse.{{r|Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel #5}}

Afterward, Adam returned to action as a full time superhero. After a discussion with Uatu the Watcher, Adam traveled to [[Uzbekistan]] to help the [[Winter Guard (Earth-616)|Winter Guard]] subdue the extra dimensional King Hyperion.{{r|Age of Heroes #3}}

[[File:Adam Brashear (Earth-616) and Mark Milton (Earth-4023) from Age of Heroes Vol 1 3 0001.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Blue Marvel vs King Hyperion]]
===[[Fear Itself]]===
Blue Marvel was exploring the [[Exo-Space|Neutral Zone]] when he returned and discovered a submarine lodged into Kadesh, Adam's undersea base. Both the Chinese and American forces blamed the other, and they seemed on the brink of war. Blue Marvel managed to save his anti matter samples from being exposed to water, and relations between the Chinese and Americans returned to normal. Though Blue Marvel was left wondering how a submarine got into his Kadesh, Adam soon discovered that the sea dragon that was guarding the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]]'s undersea prison was responsible for sending a submarine into his base.{{r|Fear Itself: The Home Front #4}}

===Mighty Avengers===
Blue Marvel was seen with [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu]] at the bottom of the [[Mariana Trench]]. After a one sided conversation,{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 2}} Adam took up his costume and flew through [[Shuma-Gorath (Multiverse)|Shuma-Gorath]]'s head. Adam was able to heal [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Spectrum]], who had been incapacitated by [[Proxima Midnight (Earth-616)|Proxima Midnight]]'s spear. Adam was able to boost Monica's powers temporarily and was among those [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] declared [[Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 3}}

[[File:Mighty Avengers Vol 2 10 Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]
Adam remained in the team, while Adam spent most of his time still working in Kadesh.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 6}} Blue Marvel brought the Mighty Avengers into a conflict against his son [[Max Brashear (Earth-616)|Max Breasher]], who had been trying to open a portal to the Neutral Zone to rescue Kevin. Max, under the alias of Doctor Positron, lured his father and his teammates to [[Island of Doctor Positron|his base in an island]] to activated a portal to the Neutral Zone in order to bring Kevin back.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 8}} Kevin started emerging from the portal hideously enlarged and distorted as Max attempted but failed to stabilize the portal. Blue Marvel realized the only way to save him was to push him back, for which [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] attacked Kevin until he went inside the portal once more so it could be deactivated without any risk.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 9}}

Some time later, Max reunited with his father in more calmly manner and informed Adam that he had managed to get rough coordinates of Kevin's location within the Neutral Zone, and Kevin communicated with him, warning him about the [[Beyond Corporation (Multiverse)|Beyond Corporation]].{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 5}} When the Mighty Avengers confronted [[Jason Quantrell (Earth-616)|one of their avatars]], Adam and Max worked together to reprogram the portal Beyond Corporation used to enter reality and successfully bring back Kevin, who had been empowered by his exposure to the Neutral Zone. Kevin forced Beyond's agent back to the Neutral Zone, disappearing as well in the process. Blue Marvel and Max set out to try to reach out to Kevin again.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 7}} Around this time, Adam and Spectrum started to develop romantic feelings towards each other, and slowly began a relationship.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 5}}

===Ultimates===
When [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] proposed to [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] the creation of a government-sanctioned proactive task force with the purpose of looking into potential threats and solve them before they could become a problem to the [[Earth]], T'Challa suggested having Adam in the team. Adam in turn suggested Spectrum, and also demanded that the team refrained from applying violent solutions whenever possible.{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 8}}

During a mission in an attempt to explore what lies outside all of reality, the Ultimates stumbled upon Anti-Man in the [[Neutral Zone]].{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 3}} Blue Marvel attempted to kill Anti-Man, in part because he had deemed him too dangerous and in part to avenge his wife, but Kevin persuaded him to spare Conner. Blue Marvel did and had Anti-Man brought onto the Abeona so that he and the Ultimates could fix him later on.{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 4}} The Ultimates' journey outside was cut short when their ship was destroyed by the strain it was enduring. [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] saved the Ultimates' lives and returned them to Earth.{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 5}}

After the [[Civil War II|second superhuman Civil War]], the Ultimates were terminated by the government due to their differences on the source of conflict, the use of the precognitive abilities of the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses Cain]].{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 12}} Regardless of their dissolution, the Ultimates would later on reassemble in secret at the request of Galactus in order to investigate the mystery of who had chained the embodiment of the Multiverse, [[Eternity (Multiverse)|Eternity]].{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 1}} In the process of unveiling the mystery and helping defeat Eternity's jailer, the [[First Firmament (First Cosmos)|First Firmament]], the Ultimates were absorbed into [[Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]], being reinstated as an openly sanctioned team.{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 6}}

===Reforming the Three Xs===
When [[James Woo (Earth-616)|Jimmy Woo]] began investigating a man who had been wearing the [[Eternity Mask]] and posing as the [[Jim Gardley (Earth-616)|Masked Raider]], he reformed the [[Scientists Guild|Three Xs]] with Blue Marvel and [[Dwayne Taylor (Earth-616)|Night Thrasher]], in order to help with the investigation.{{r|Marvel Comics Vol 1 1000}} They also helped several heroes with the mysterious murder of [[Bel-Dann (Earth-616)|an unknown man]].{{r|Incoming Vol 1 1}}

===Doctor Doom===
Following the explosion of the [[Antlion Station|Antlion Space Station]] caused by terrorists disguised as Latverians, creating a [[Glossary:Black Hole|Black Hole]], Blue Marvel was asked to recapture a recently escaped [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]].{{r|Doctor Doom Vol 1 1|2}} He, along with [[Highly Engineered Robot Built for Interdimensional Exploration (Earth-616)|H.E.R.B.I.E.]], were able locate Doom at [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]]'s apartment, however, after Doom was shot by [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]]. Le Fay tried to convince Blue Marvel that Doom was innocent this time, but upon his revival, Doom blasted Marvel unconscious.{{r|Doctor Doom Vol 1 3}} After relocating Doom at the house of [[Fruzsina Markovich (Earth-616)|Fruzsina Markovich]], he battled [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]], [[Zora Vukovic (Earth-616)|Victorious]], and [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang]] who were there to aid Doom in reclaiming his throne. Blue Marvel tried to capture Doom, however, Doom was able to escape him once again.{{r|Doctor Doom Vol 1 4|5}}

He and Reed Richards were later able to contact Doom and help in how to deal with the Black Hole, with Doom convincing them that Marvel's powers were more than enough to fix the problem.{{r|Doctor Doom Vol 1 6}} After donning a [[Blue Adam's Black Hole Exploration Suit|suit for Black Hole Exploration]] he went inside the black hole in order to fix the problem. However, after entering the black hole his powers were tapped out and was stuck inside, while the black hole kept existing. Suddenly, Blue Marvel was approached by [[Doctor Octopus]] from an alternate reality who was sent by his reality [[Doctor Doom]] to help in fixing the problem with negative energy bombs.{{r|Doctor Doom Vol 1 7}} While Otto told Blue Marvel that his reality's Doctor Doom, the benevolent ruler of the world, had horrific visions of Marvel's Doom, they were attacked by the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]]. Otto himself was killed by the monsters, but Blue Marvel somehow couldn't die, and so escaped to the other side the singularity that was within the hole.{{r|Doctor Doom Vol 1 8}}

Blue Marvel would land in the alternate reality, where he would find the reformed Doctor Doom that Otto spoke about. Brashear was taken back to a futuristic version of Doomstadt and discussed the Antlion and Octavius with the alternate Doom and the Doom of the Prime Universe. Later, in a fit of rage, Victor would murder his alternate self and take an encased [[Ultimate Nullifier (Weapon)|Ultimate Nullifier]] to destroy the reality. However, he spared Blue Marvel, dropping the angry hero into a remote ocean on Earth-616.{{r|Doctor Doom Vol 1 10}}

| Powers                  = '''[[Anti-Matter]] Energy Absorption Physiology:''' Theoretically, it seems to be the main source of Blue Marvel's power. This source of power is the energy released from anti-matter which derives from the dimension called the Negative Zone.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update Vol 1 1}} Anti-matter is the same as normal matter except that the sub-atomic particles are the opposite charge. Therefore, anti-matter and normal matter cannot coexist without exploding. CERN was the first to synthesize particles of anti-matter on Earth in 1995, keeping them in a magnetically charged vacuum to keep it from coming in contact with normal matter. Nuclear fission releases energy with 1.5% efficiency; anti-matter releases energy with 100% efficiency. One gram of anti-matter contains the same energy as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. One droplet could power New York City for a full day. Adam Brashear is the first human anti-matter generator and reactor. The experiment he gained his powers from renders his form unaffected from anti-matter. Blue Marvel was considered to be an Alpha Level Threat by [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America (Sam Wilson)]] and [[Iron Man (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]].{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers #1}}

*'''Enhanced Mental Perception/Hyper-Cosmic Awareness:''' Blue Marvel possesses the ability to sense & comprehend things on levels that far exceed human capabilities. He can perceive different sensory spectra beyond the regular norm. [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Superior Spider-Man]] once likened him to being his own Electron Microscope,{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 3}} enabling him to see into Spectrum's damaged energy form in order to repair what Proxima had done. Later he would expand his consciousness further through one of his inventions to find out about [[Eternity (Earth-616)|the imprisonment of conceptual existence]].{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 1}}
