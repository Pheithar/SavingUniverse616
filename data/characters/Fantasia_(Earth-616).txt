| History                 = Fantasia was a [[Dire Wraith]], presumably arriving on [[Earth]] at some time during the [[Wraith War]] against [[Rom (Earth-616)|Rom]], the [[Spaceknights (Galadorian) (Earth-616)|Spaceknight]]. She suffered amnesia and forgot her true form and mission. Under unrevealed circumstances, she came to use the magical powers she still possessed as an agent of the [[USSR|Soviet people]].

As part of the {{m|Supreme Soviets}}, Fantasia used her abilities to disguise the team as the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. While doing so they attacked the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers (Earth-616)|Soviet Super-Soldiers]]. [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] was drawn into the conflict, and ended up saving Fantasia from a beast.{{r|Captain America #352|353}}

As Fantasma, she was part of the [[People's Protectorate (Earth-616)|People's Protectorate]] when the Supreme Soviets were renamed after the fall of the USSR.{{r|Soviet Super Soldiers #1}} The Protectorate battled the [[Combine (Earth-616)|Combine]] and the [[Peace Corpse (Earth-616)|Peace Corpse]].{{r|Avengers #320|324}} She also fought the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] and the [[Pantheon (Earth-616)|Pantheon]] while trying to recover a renegade [[Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (Earth-616)|KGB]] agent from America.{{r|Incredible Hulk #393}} Fantasma was later seen as part of the [[Winter Guard (Earth-616)|Winter Guard]] as they battled the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]] and his ''[[Dragon of Heaven]]''.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #9|10}}

After [[Laynia Petrovna (Earth-616)|Darkstar]] died while serving with the X-Men, Fantasma was among those seven members of the Winter Guard who left to form a splinter group, the [[Protectorate (Earth-616)|Protectorate]], who sought a way to bring Darkstar back to life. They ended up in [[Limbo (Temporal)|Limbo]], where they made a deal to serve [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]] for a year in exchange for his help. However, before their year of service ended, Fantasma recovered her full memories, revealed herself to be a Dire Wraith, and traveled back to Earth, appearing in Saint Petersburg. Rescued by the current Winter Guard and brought to their base, the [[Citadel (Location)|Citadel]], a former Dire Wraith base that had been taken over by the Russian government, Fantasma pretended to not to remember her origins and let the Winter Guard leave the base. Once the team had gone, Fantasma made her way to a sub-basement where she found a hidden nursery full of Wraith eggs waiting to be born. Even as the Protectorate returned to Earth too and told the Winter Guard of what had happened in Limbo and that Fantasma was a Dire Wraith, Fantasma formed an alliance with [[Sergei Krylov (Earth-616)|The Presence]] and took over the former Winter Guard headquarters, and then, working together, they began to awaken the Wraith.

The Winter Guard stormed the base and were attacked by the full force of Fantasia's Dire Wraith army. However, [[Illarion Pavlovich Ramskov (Earth-616)|Powersurge]] and [[Red Guardian (Anton) (Earth-616)|Red Guardian]] managed to make a device capable of defeating the Dire Wraiths and [[Galina Nemirovsky (Earth-616)|Crimson Dynamo]] boosted its signal, which created a tear in time that led to Limbo. This tear started to grow and would consume everything. In order to seal it, Galina threw Fantasia into the tear. Refusing to be destroyed by herself in vain, she dragged [[Tania Belinskaya (Earth-616)|Starlight]] into the tear too. This caused the tear to collapse on itself and kill both of them.{{r|Darkstar and the Winter Guard #1|3}}
