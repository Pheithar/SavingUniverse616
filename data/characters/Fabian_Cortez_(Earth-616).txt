===Early Life===
Fabian Cortez was a [[Mutant]] born into wealth and privilege, but became bored with his life.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 2}}

===Upstarts and Acolytes===
Cortez joined the [[Upstarts (Earth-616)|Upstarts]] for excitement, a group of mutants organized by the [[Gamesmaster (Earth-616)|Gamesmaster]] who were awarded points for killing other mutants. Cortez gathered a group of mutants who believed in [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]'s teachings and formed the [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]]. He brought the group to [[Asteroid M]], Magneto's orbital base, only to arrange for its destruction and the death of the first wave of Acolytes along with their messiah.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 1|3}} 

Obtaining many points for the deaths of such powerful mutants, Cortez then gathered a second group of Acolytes easily by playing Magneto off as a martyr. [[Simon Hall (Earth-616)|Neophyte]] overheard Cortez telling the Gamesmaster about how he killed Magneto and caused the other Acolytes to abandon him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 299|304}}

When Magneto returned and was mind-wiped, the Gamesmaster stripped Cortez of his points. Furious, Fabian concocted an elaborate scheme to regain them. He kidnapped [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna Maximoff]], the daughter of [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] and granddaughter of Magneto, and began a civil war on [[Genosha]] by encouraging mutates to kill the ruling humans. Both the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] tried to stop him, and he was apparently killed by the new Acolyte leader [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 367|369}}

Cortez resurfaced months later when [[Joseph (Earth-616)|Joseph]] assumed control of the Acolytes. Pretending to help Joseph assume Magneto's leadership role, his schemes were again unveiled. He then tried to destroy the X-Men with another wave of Acolytes, but eventually abandoned his own allies.{{r|Magneto Vol 1 1|4}}

Later when Magneto was returned to his full mental capacity, he gave Cortez a chance to redeem himself. Weakened by trying to manipulate the Earth's magnetic field, Magneto needed Cortez's powers to keep him rejuvenated. Magneto offered Cortez a place on the Genoshan cabinet, which he accepted. When Magneto attempted to obtain technology from [[Carrion Cove]] that would return his power levels to normal, Cortez betrayed him and helped the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] by augmenting rogue Acolytes to fight Magneto and his mutate army. His power levels faded during the battle for Carrion Cove, while Magneto returned to full power. Magneto finally got his revenge and used his new strength to repel Cortez fifty miles and smash him into the ground; he died on impact.{{r|Magneto: Dark Seduction Vol 1 1|4}}

===Necrosha===
Cortez was resurrected via the [[Techno-organic Virus|Transmode Virus]] during the [[Necrosha]] crisis and, searching for Magneto with his fellow acolytes [[Marco Delgado (Earth-616)|Delgado]] and [[Seamus Mellencamp (Earth-616)|Mellencamp]], battled [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] and [[Alani Ryan (Earth-616)|Loa]]. They were eventually, and contrary to the other "zombies" who weren't killable, killed by Loa's powers as Loa was used as a projectile by Deadpool.{{r|X-Force Annual Vol 3 1}}

===Upstarts v. X-Men v. O.N.E.===
Cortez reappeared once again as a member of the mutant group the Upstarts. He helped kill the [[Nasty Boys (Earth-616)|Nasty Boys]] in order to lure out [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and his ragtag team of X-Men to [[Washington Heights]]. After a brief moment of words, the two groups engaged each other in battle. Cortez faced off against [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]] and the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] but became overwhelmed as they were outnumbered. He fled the scene with [[Siena Blaze (Earth-616)|Siena Blaze]] and [[Trevor Fitzroy (Earth-1191)|Fitzroy]] leaving [[Shinobi Shaw (Earth-616)|Shaw]] behind as a scapegoat.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 20}}

He was the last of the [[Upstarts (Earth-616)|Upstarts]] alive. The [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] bailed him out to help. He used his powers to help the [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Black Queen]] remove mutants from the minds of every person.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 21}} It was revealed that [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]] had not forgotten about mutants. Their sentinel squad came and started attacking. After many casualties, they shot and vaporized Cortez into nothing, which killed him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 22}}

===House of X===
Cortez was later seen resurrected and well among [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]] and other [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]] when they were first greeted by a hologram of Professor X, then later when they were seen on [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] among other X-Men villains and foes. As Professor X's hologram was conversing with them, around the world he was also greeting and conversing with other mutants, welcoming them into the country of Krakoa.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}

===S.W.O.R.D.===
[[File:Fabian Cortez (Earth-616) from S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]
Cortez later appeared as a member of [[Six (Earth-616)|The Six]], a mutant sub-team under the command of [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] and its commander [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]].{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1}} He was the "head" of the mutant power amplification and unification, under the guise of The Power. During the attack of [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] on Krakoa, he headed with other S.W.O.R.D members to defend Krakoa as he gained access to the island by possessing the body of [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Kid Cable]]. As he saw [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]] break both his legs from a great fall after attacking a [[Symbiote Dragons|Symbiote Dragon]], he healed him and greatly enhanced his powers, only for Knull to kill them both for their transgressions against him.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 2|4}}

He was later revived with the help of Jean Grey, nude and confused he remembered he requested a meeting with Magneto and the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council]] (with Brand and [[Peter Quinn (Earth-616)|Peepers]] sitting in). After he discussed his views on the law against murdering [[Humans|Flatscans]] being a waste of not showing mutant superiority, he soon came to realize through their comments and questions that they were just humouring him and didn't take him seriously. Lashing out, he mentioned how vital he was to S.W.O.R.D and how he should be treated better, only for [[Amelia Voght (Earth-616)|Amelia Voght]] and [[Khora (Earth-616)|Khora of the Burning Heart]] to teleport in and announce Khora as his replacement.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 5}}

After this humiliation he fell into depression and began drinking at The [[Green Lagoon]] and frequenting [[Miranda Leevald (Earth-616)|Stacy X]]'s brothel, but everywhere he went just furthered his humiliation.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 2|3}}

Still hoping to find a way to break the law against killing humans without getting into trouble, he took [[Tomi Shishido (Multiverse)|Gorgon]] who had come back from his death in [[Otherworld]] not in the right frame of mind, to [[Central Park]] and amplified his telepathy so he could hear every negative and hateful thing the people around him where thinking. He almost succeeded in getting Gorgon to kill everybody there but [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Knightcrawler]] prevented this by teleporting into an ice-cream stand, making everybody laugh. This allowed the confused Gorgon to calm down and he started serving humans Ice-Cream much to Fabian's dismay. Fabian begged Nightcrawler not to report this to The Quiet Council but instead Kurt dragged him to [[Mars (Planet)|Planet Arakko]] and forced him to confront one of his former victims, [[Lost (Marinette) (Earth-616)|Lost]] who's parents were killed in an attack by the Acolytes.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 4}} Kurt had hoped they could talk it out but instead the two continually tried to kill each other. Realizing he wasn't getting through to them, he teleported them both into the sky and let them fall to their potential deaths. He told Fabian if he made an attempt to apologize to Lost she could use her gravity manipulation to unsure they all land safely, but if not he'll block her powers so all three die. Fabian made an attempt to sincerely apologize to her and admitted there was something wrong with him but this reconciliation was ruined when [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]] possessed him and made him overload her with power, burning her out. When he came too he was horrified by what had happened and told Kurt it wasn't his fault. He realized they were still falling and now as a result of Lost's power overload, the moon [[Phobos (Moon)|Phobos]] had fallen out of orbit and was now about to crush the planet. After Kurt stopped their decent, Fabian tried to convince him to teleport them to safety but Nightcrawler refused to leave without protecting those still on the planet. He told Fabian to overload him with power as he did to Lost, so with his last dying breath he could put Phobos back in orbit. Fabian broke down and in a shocking moment of humility, he confessed to Nightrawler that he believed he'd fail and that all he really wanted was for people to like and respect him, Kurt asked him how he expected people to like him when he clearly despised himself. Fabian briefly overcame his cowardice and selfishness and helped Nightcrawler save the planet, Kurt then gave Fabian the task of helping him restore his memories after his resurrection so he could remember how to stop Onslaught, unfortunately at that moment Onslaught possessing Xavier appeared behind him and but him in a coma. Later Kurt was shown his comatose body in the [[Healing Gardens]] and the still Onslaught possessed Xavier denied the option to kill and then resurrect him, denying him the right to restore Kurt's memories or earn redemption.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 5}}
