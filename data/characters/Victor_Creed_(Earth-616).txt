===Early Years===
====Origin====
When Victor Creed's mutation first manifested, he accidentally killed [[Luther Creed (Earth-616)|his brother]] over a piece of pie. [[Zebadiah Creed (Earth-616)|His father]] confined him to a cellar and would systematically pull out Victor's "devil teeth" in an attempt to purge the boy of his "demons". Victor was chained like an animal in the family cellar for years until one day he chewed off his own hand in order to break free, subsequently murdering his father.{{r|X-Men Origins: Sabretooth #1}} Although he would later claim to have killed [[Victoria Creed (Earth-616)|his mother]] as well, he actually spared her, and made sure she lived a comfortable life, until she was diagnosed with cancer and confined to a hospital, where she was killed by a member of the [[Red Right Hand (Earth-616)|Red Right Hand]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 11}}

Freed from his parents, Victor was unleashed upon society. At age thirteen, he reportedly rampaged across three [[Canada|Canadian]] provinces and killed at least three police officers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #326}} According to Creed, he remained in Canada and, at about fifteen, worked for the railroad, laying down rail from [[Calgary]] up to the [[Yukon]].<ref>The Canadian Pacific Railway reached Calgary in 1883 and the route up to the Yukon was completed around 1900; if Victor Creed was 15 while laying rails that would place his birth between 1868 and 1885.</ref> Among the workers on the line was a belligerent older man who delighted in picking on the teenage Creed. Though the man "had a hundred pounds on him", Creed gutted him from crotch to Adam's apple with his claws.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 33}}

====Meeting Wolverine and killing Silver Fox====

[[File:Wolverine Vol 2 10 page 00 Victor Creed (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|left|Sabretooth facing Logan after the death of Silver Fox]]

For years, Victor was beating and torturing his brother, [[Saul Creed (Earth-616)|Saul]] on each one of his birthday until one day his sister, [[Clara Creed (Earth-616)|Clara]], told him that his brother died and was now free from him.{{r|Origin II Vol 1 5}}

Victor quickly learned that his brother died at the hands of the man named [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]], he then decided to get his revenge and went after him. In 1909, he discovered that a serial killer killed three people in as many months and after finding an unconscious Logan in the middle of a crime scene, he believed that Logan was the mysterious serial killer the police were after.

Before the police arrived, Victor snatched the unconscious Logan from the crime scene and took him to the [[Ravencroft Institute]] in [[Westchester County]] where he was working as [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Nathaniel Essex]]' assistant. Essex lobotomized Logan which put him in a comatose state, he then proceeded to cut Logan's left arm off while Victor was enjoying seeing Logan suffer. One of the doctors, [[Claudia Russell (Earth-616)|Claudia Russell]], was able to free Logan and tried to help him escape, but on their way out the duo was confronted by Victor.

Victor threw Logan away and confronted Claudia, but Logan’s healing factor kicked in and started to heal his brain, awakening him from his comatose state. Logan thrust his claws into Victor's head through his lower jaw, but Victor was able to throw him away once again. Knowing that Logan had no chance against Victor in his condition, Claudia begged him to escape while Victor was injured. Despite still being in a feral state because of his brain injury, Logan understood and agreed to escape.

Before Victor could go after Logan, Claudia revealed to him that Logan was not responsible for the murders, which had happened during a full moon, and she was the killer but it was an accident. She then transformed into a werewolf and attacked the injured Victor, who was saved by Essex resulting in Claudia's capture. Victor and Essex later experimented on Claudia and killed her.{{r|Ruins of Ravencroft: Sabretooth #1}}

In the following years, Victor - now known as Sabretooth - supposedly joined the organization of the mysterious [[Romulus (Earth-616)|Romulus]], and moved to [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], where he murdered several women. But one night during one of his rampages, he once again faced Logan.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 52}} Logan had been extorted by the ninja sect known as [[Hand (Earth-616)|the Hand]] into fighting Sabretooth.

During their fight, Logan was able to cut off one of Sabretooth's hand with his sword but Sabretooth was able to reattach it thanks to his healing factor, to the surprise of Logan. Sabretooth was then defeated by Logan who impaled him with his sword. But before Logan could finish him, their fight was stopped by Romulus who knocked Logan out.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 53}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 55}}

Under Romulus' orders, Sabretooth then tracked Logan to a frontier community in the [[Canadian Rockies]]. There he brutally attacked [[Silver Fox (Canadian) (Earth-616)|Silver Fox]], Logan's lover, raping her and leaving her for dead, the first of many birthday "surprises" from him to come. Enraged, Logan battled Sabretooth in a bar, only to be defeated.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 10}} Sabretooth then manipulated a feral, mindless Logan into believing the people of a nearby town had ordered Silver Fox's death, prompting Logan to slaughter the inhabitants of the town, persuading him that "the townspeople are afraid of you--they don't want you around. So, they got rid of the one thing keeping you here."{{r|Wolverine: Origins Vol 1 5}}

===Sabretooth Unleashed===
[[File:X-Men Origins Sabretooth Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Sabretooth Unleashed!]]
====Fighting all around the world====
Later on, in 1912, during [[Silas Burr (Earth-616)|Silas Burr]]'s trial, a gun battle broke out and Burr was taken away by one of the bailiffs, a man eventually known as Sabretooth. Sabretooth, under the orders of Romulus, took him up to Canada, where he met a man who needed his services, a man by the name of [[Frederick Hudson (Earth-616)|Hudson]].{{r|Wolverine: Origins #14}}

In 1938, Victor was present in [[Nanjing]] alongside [[Ogun (Earth-616)|Ogun]] and watched General Matsui enter the city.{{r|Death of Wolverine: The Weapon X Program Vol 1 3}}

Sabretooth later served in the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|American military]] during the [[Korean War]], moving to the island of [[Madripoor]] after his time in the service.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 10}}

====Avengers 1959====
[[File:New Avengers Vol 2 10 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Sabretooth as part of the Nick Fury's Avengers team]]
In 1959, during his time in Madripoor, [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] found Victor and recruited him into his black ops team known as the [[Avengers (1950s) (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. Sabretooth also had some as yet unknown history with fellow recruit [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]] in [[Africa]], prompting the latter to shoot him on sight. The two put aside their differences long enough to complete their assigned mission.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 10}} This mission involved traveling to [[Helsingborg]], [[Sweden]] in order to stop the [[Red Skull (1950s Impostor) (Earth-616)|imposter Red Skull]] from reforming the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazis]] into a Fourth Reich and completing his research on a new super-soldier formula. Sabretooth walked into the path of an oncoming Nazi truck, slashing the driver to ribbons when he got out to check on him. The group then used the hijacked truck to gain entry into the Skull's castle headquarters.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 11}} Kraven accidentally shot Sabretooth in the back during the ensuing battle as he was trying to target the Red Skull. Creed soon healed, but his bloodlust cost the group valuable information as he beheaded the Red Skull impostor before he could be properly interrogated.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 12}} Fury took the Skull's briefcase and told the team that he would meet up with them later before disappearing for over a month.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 13}} When he reappeared, he invited the Avengers members to the [[Stork Club]] in New York City to celebrate a job well done before all of the members went their separate ways.

After dinner, Sabretooth began hitchhiking out of New York on his way to [[Toronto]]. He was soon picked up by a driver in a pickup truck who had a skull logo hanging from his rearview mirror. The man turned out to be a [[Werewolves|werewolf]] whom Sabretooth had to fight to survive, though the creature was eventually run over by another car driving down the highway. Fury soon reunited his team when it became apparent that several other members were similarly attacked.{{r|Avengers 1959 #1}} The attacks were orchestrated by an organization known as [[ICON (1950s) (Earth-616)|ICON]] and their leader [[Geoffrey Sydenham (Earth-616)|Geoffrey Sydenham]] to get the Nazi hunters out of the way before continuing their plan to start World War Three with [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Russia]]. Sabretooth proved himself invaluable, if somewhat unpredictable, to the Avengers' attempt to stop ICON, fighting their forces in the South China Sea,{{r|Avengers 1959 #2|3}} Madripoor,{{r|Avengers 1959 #4}} [[Wakanda]], and [[Washington, D.C.]].{{r|Avengers 1959 #5}} His bloodlust again became apparent when Fury allowed him to kill all of the members of the [[Ubermadchen (Earth-616)|Ubermadchen]] after they had revealed what they knew of ICON's plot.{{r|Avengers 1959 #4}} After ICON had been defeated, Creed, along with the rest of the team, received pardons for any activities that they were wanted for by the government. As the group disbanded, Creed headed for [[Los Angeles]] by train with his teammates [[Duvid Fortunov (Earth-616)|Dominic Fortune]] and the [[Louise Grant (Earth-616)|Blonde Phantom]].{{r|Avengers 1959 #5}}

====Team X====

[[File:Team X (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|left|Victor Creed, John Wraith, David North, and Logan as part of Team X]]

Sometime in the mid-60s Creed, now codenamed Sabretooth, was a member of a special black-ops group, along with Wolverine and [[Christoph Nord (Earth-616)|Maverick]]. One of their missions was to steal the [[Carbonadium Synthesizer]] from Russia, which led them to meet [[Arkady Rossovich (Earth-616)|Omega Red]], and forced him into hibernation. Sabretooth was a cold operative, willing to sell out his teammates to save himself and the mission.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 5}}-[[X-Men Vol 2 7|7]]}}

While on a mission in [[Germany]], Creed was assigned to guard [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Leni Zauber]], a German spy. The two became intimate, and Zauber eventually gave birth to a child whom Creed never knew until years later, just as he didn't know that Leni was actually Mystique. Creed was also abducted by the original [[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X Program]], which was attempting to create super-powered sleeper agents. Part of the program was brainwashing and memory-implanting, performed by the [[Aldo Ferro (Earth-616)|Psi-Borg]] using elaborate movie sets. It seemed that unlike some of the other recruits, Sabretooth already had his claws and anti-aging factor. However, he did not receive the adamantium bonding that Wolverine did.{{r|{{cl|Sabretooth Vol 1 1}}-[[Sabretooth Vol 1 4|4]]}}

====[[Vietnam War]]====
In 1968 Creed was serving in [[Vietnam]] and it was during this time he killed a number prostitutes.{{r|Marvel Atlas #1|; Vietnam's entry}} While in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] a man known as the "[[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|White Devil]]" was rumored to be involved in the disappearance of soldiers and locals. Creed was offered a job leading his own team of enforcers, which he happily accepted.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 27}}

[[File:Holly Bright (Earth-616) 00.jpg|thumb|right|Holly Bright a.k.a Holo]]

====Holo====
After the disbandment of Team X, Logan and Victor reunited as friends, when Logan learned of anti-mutant forces within the government. Victor and Logan formed a team of rebel mutants, and Victor fell in love with a mutant named [[Holly Bright (Earth-616)|Holo]]. This led him to begin to become a better man, but on their last mission together, he was manipulated into killing her. This act led him down a dark path which would last almost a century.{{r|First X-Men Vol 1 1|5}}

===Modern Times===
====Facing Iron Fist====
[[File:Iron Fist Vol 1 14.jpg|thumb|left|Sabretooth facing Iron Fist during his first appearance]]

Sabretooth was approached by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]], who hoped to recruit Sabretooth to his [[X-Men (Earth-616)|team of mutant heroes]]. He offered Sabretooth a chance at redemption, but Sabretooth was uninterested, answering that as long as the world treated him as a monster, that was what he would give them, and that he wasn't interested in working with others. When Xavier told him that he was considering recruiting Logan, Sabretooth became enraged and attacked him. Xavier used his powers to immobilize Sabretooth, and erased their meeting from his memories. {{r|Weapon X: First Class Vol 1 1}}

Emerging as a costumed villain, Sabretooth became partners with the [[Frank Payne (Earth-616)|Constrictor]] and the two acted as enforcers for major criminal interests. Sabretooth battled [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]] and was badly beaten.{{r|Iron Fist #14}} Sabretooth and the Constrictor then fought Iron Fist, [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]], [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]], and [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]] only to be defeated again. With the Constrictor, Creed began to stalk and kill human beings for pleasure, which earned him the newspaper title of "The Slasher"; he also attacked Misty Knight again. With the Constrictor, he attacked [[Harmony Young (Earth-616)|Harmony Young]], but they were defeated by Luke Cage. The Constrictor and Sabretooth soon dissolved their partnership, and Sabretooth nearly killed the Constrictor at one time.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #66}}{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #78}}{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #84}}

====Marauders====

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 213.jpg|thumb|right|Sabretooth facing Wolverine during [[Mutant Massacre]]]]

Shortly thereafter, Creed was recruited to be a member of the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] by [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] on behalf of [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Sinister]]. Creed and his fellow Marauders were recruited in order to [[Mutant Massacre|massacre]] the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]]. Gambit, however, had not been informed of the mission's true purpose and attempted to renege. The other Marauders easily dispatched him, and Sabretooth injured him badly and left him for dead. It was in the [[Alley|Morlock tunnels]] that Sabretooth and Wolverine first encountered each other in their costumed personas. Sabretooth escaped Wolverine's vengeance, and attacked the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Mansion]], but was soundly trounced by new recruit [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #212|213}}

====Team X reunion====

[[File:Wolverine Vol 2 60.jpg|thumb|left|Sabretooth facing Shiva]]

Much later, after attacking Wolverine countless times, Sabretooth was attacked by a [[S.H.I.V.A. (Earth-616)|S.H.I.V.A.]] sent after him by the [[Truett Hudson (Earth-616)|Professor Thornton]]. He was then captured by his old teammate [[John Wraith (Earth-616)|John Wraith]], who forced him to join his Team X teammates to discover why their age-suppression was wearing off. They infiltrated the old base and discovered the truth about the program and their memories. While being driven mad by Psi-Borg, Sabretooth killed Silver Fox, whom Logan had loved, thus fulfilling the implanted memory of her murder at Creed's hands that had haunted Wolverine for years. Sabretooth was seemingly consumed by Psi-Borg, but re-emerged later, with some of his memory implants removed, thanks to the telepath.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #60|64}}

====Birdy====
Sometime prior to this, Sabretooth had found a telepath named [[Birdy (Earth-616)|Birdy]] who used her powers to calm his murderous rages. During this period Sabretooth often dressed in suits and began building a power base. A deal with the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] brought him into conflict with Omega Red and the X-Men again, and he was thwarted. Soon afterwards, Creed's son [[Graydon Creed (Earth-616)|Graydon]] discovered his father's identity and came after him, eventually killing Birdy, which drove Sabretooth mad.{{r|{{cl|Sabretooth Vol 1 1}}-[[Sabretooth Vol 1 4|4]]}}

====Prisoner of the X-Men====

[[File:Phalanx Covenant 0009.jpg|thumb|right|Sabretooth helping Generation X]]

Sabretooth lost all control at this point, and Maverick called in the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] to help stop him. Amazingly, [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] thought that Creed was crying for help, and chose to take him into the Mansion and help him rather than kill him.{{r|X-Men Unlimited #3}}

While he was a patient/prisoner in the X-Mansion, Sabretooth constantly goaded the X-Men, but was beaten back time and again by [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], who refused to give him his "fix" of fear, and by [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] during a power outage. Creed did have his useful moments: He assisted [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]] in tracking [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]] in the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlock]] tunnels, and when the [[Phalanx]] attacked the X-Men, he helped [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]] and [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] locate and rescue the [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]] mutants.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #28}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #311|317}}

[[File:Wolverine Vol 2 90 The Brothers Hildebrandt art.jpg|thumb|left|Sabretooth vs Wolverine to the death!]]

However, at his core he was still vicious and merciless, and one night when Wolverine was guarding him alone, Sabretooth nagged his nemesis to no end. Finally, when the moment was right, Creed slammed into the restraining force field and pushed his way through it, daring Logan to kill him. Wolverine nearly complied, putting a bone claw through Sabretooth's brain.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 90}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 328.jpg|thumb|right|Sabretooth vs Psylocke.]]

Following that particular encounter, Creed was reduced for a time to a childlike mental state, but he soon recovered and tricked [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boomer]] into releasing him. [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] intervened, and was critically injured as Sabretooth escaped. [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]] was also wounded, his metal wings slashed open, precipitating the return of his feathered flesh-and-blood wings.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 328}}{{r|Sabretooth Special Vol 1 1}}

====X-Factor====
When Creed was finally brought down by the X-Men, he was taken into government custody, fitted with a restraining collar that prevented him from attacking without sanction, and made a member of [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]. Eventually, however, Sabretooth inured himself to the pain generated by the collar and ripped it off, whereupon he hacked and slashed his way through his teammates, nearly killing them all.{{r|X-Factor #122|136}}

Creed then rejoined his true "employers," the [[Hound]] Program, but was censured for killing, and not simply capturing, his targets.{{r|X-Factor #138}}

====Adamantium====

[[File:Wolverine Vol 2 127.jpg|thumb|left|Sabretooth Triumphant!]]

Sabretooth appeared during Wolverine's marriage to [[Viper (Madame Hydra) (Earth-616)|Viper]]. This time, Sabretooth sported new adamantium-laced bones and claws, as well as an extremely accelerated healing factor, making him much more deadly than usual. Sabretooth also had implants which made him much stronger than a man of his build and weight.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #125|127}}

However, Creed lost his adamantium when he failed to defeat Wolverine in a match set up by [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] to see who would be his next Horseman. Apocalypse, having siphoned all the metal out of Creed and implanted it into Logan, left Sabretooth for dead.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #145}}{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #8}} Later, Gambit found Creed dying in a cave in [[South America]], guarded by tribal natives.{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #8}} In return for helping Creed recover, Gambit got him to lead him to one of Sinister's bases.{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #9}} After that mission, Gambit secured enough adamantium from the Constrictor to keep Creed alive.{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #11}}

===The Rise and Fall of Sabretooth===
====Revamped Weapon X====

[[File:Weapon X The Draft Vol 1 Wild Child page 12 Kyle Gibney (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|right|Sabretooth "working" with his Weapon X teammate Wild Child]]

Months later, Creed was captured and re-implanted with adamantium bones by what turned out to be a revamped Weapon X project. He ran some recruiting missions for them, but appalled most of the agents with his twisted bloodlust.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #159|166}}

Secretly though, Sabretooth was gathering information such as the [[Malcolm Colcord (Earth-616)|Director]]'s command codes and other resources, which he used after escaping from the program. He hired Omega Red and [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]] to hunt down and attempt to kill Wolverine's nearest and dearest: [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], the Hudsons, his foster-daughter [[Amiko Kobayashi (Earth-616)|Amiko]], and her guardian [[Yukio (Earth-616)|Yukio]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #173}}

[[File:Victor Creed (Earth-616) from Wolverine Vol 2 175 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Sabretooth revealing the Truth to Wolverine about "The Logan Files"]]

He then activated a Neutralizer-like cannon using the Director's codes, stealing Logan's mutant abilities and stole the precious "Logan Files". The captured Amiko and Logan were brought to Creed, who taunted Logan with a game of cat and mouse, for Amiko's life and for the "Logan Files," supposedly his lost memories. Logan managed to beat Creed, who was himself shot with the Neutralizer cannon but he managed to escape by teleporting himself away.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #174|175}}

Sabretooth, now in possession of Weapon X's files, set himself against the organization, beating them to their recruits and killing them horribly. Worse, Creed planned to sell the secrets of Weapon X to other countries looking to set up their own mutant forces.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 #1}}

[[File:Weapon X Vol 2 2 page 19 Victor Creed (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|right|Sabretooth hunting down Weapon X]]

Finally, after Sabretooth viciously scarred [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Aurora]], the [[Malcolm Colcord (Earth-616)|Director]] called in [[Christoph Nord (Earth-616)|Weapon Zero]],{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 2}} who tracked Sabretooth down and slit his throat, shot him with adamantium bullets, and burned his flesh with acid. Zero was stopped from killing Creed only by the Director's implant, and Sabretooth was returned to the Weapon X Program.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 3}}

He was kept under control by [[Mesmero (Vincent) (Earth-616)|Mesmero]], but when Mesmero's powers failed, Sabretooth escaped. He actually returned to the compound when the [[Underground (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Underground]] attacked, and was found by [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]], who fought him and used a water release pipe to wash him down the drain.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 #13}}

====[[Sabretooth Vol 3|Open Season]]====
[[File:Sabretooth Vol 3 4 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Sabretooth vs the Wendigo]]

He was seen again in the wilderness of Canada where he encountered [[Walter Langkowski (Earth-616)|Sasquatch]] and a [[Wendigo (Race)|Wendigo]]. Sabretooth and the Wendigo ended up in the Arctic Sea, presumed dead by Sasquatch. After a fearsome battle in the Arctic waters, Sabretooth emerged victorious with the hide of the Wendigo.{{r|{{cl|Sabretooth Vol 3 1}}-[[Sabretooth Vol 3 4|4]]}}

====Megacorp & Brotherhood====

[[File:Weapon X Vol 2 26 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Sabretooth going after Sinister]]

Sabretooth later reappeared working for Megacorp, a large company whose owner wanted to destroy Sinister. He got beaten around by a bunch of Essex's genetically engineered goons, but eventually defeated them with a telepathic scrambler he had gotten from fellow Marauder [[John Greycrow (Earth-616)|Scalphunter]]. Sabretooth was then pulled off the assignment by Tomes, the owner, who was in fact [[Sublime (Earth-616)|John Sublime]].{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 #26|28}} Creed went to work with a reconstituted [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|the Brotherhood]], attacking Philadelphia and getting routed by the X-Men. Sabretooth participated in the Brotherhood's attack on the X-Mansion, and after throwing a student through a window, got into a melee with Wolverine, who appeared to dismember him.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #161|164}}

====Forced Into the X-Men====

[[File:X-Men Vol 2 188 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Back with the X-Men]]

While working a job in South America, Sabretooth came across [[Children of the Vault (Earth-616)|The Children]], a race of super-evolved humans. The Children were the result of a scientific experiment, and had been hiding themselves away in order to await the time when they might become the dominant species of Earth.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 188}} They attempted to kill Sabretooth for discovering them, but he fled, and they gave chase. Desperate, Sabretooth fled to the Xavier Institute, which after [[M-Day]] had opened its gates to all mutants who needed amnesty. Sabretooth was coerced by the X-Men into helping them find the Children's home, and taking the fight to them. He was drafted into a strike team led by [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] and made obedient with [[Nano-Sentinels|nano-sentinels]] in his bloodstream. The team was successful in defeating the Children, and Sabretooth was forced to remain with the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #192|193}}

====Evolution====
Sabretooth renewed his rivalry with Wolverine upon the latter's return to the X-Mansion. Wolverine hurled Sabretooth through a window and the two fought savagely. After fighting to a standstill, Sabretooth dug his claws into Wolverine's chest while Wolverine held his right fist against Sabretooth's throat. Sabretooth warned that he would rip Wolverine's heart out if Wolverine popped his claws. Wolverine immediately responded with "Let 'er rip" and extracted his claws.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 #50}}

After recovering, Sabretooth chained Wolverine to the roof of the [[Blackbird]]. Wolverine broke free and renewed his attack, causing Sabretooth to crash the jet into the ground. Emerging from the flaming wreckage, they continued to fight while healing from their injuries until they were suddenly separated by a bolt of lightning. Wolverine's former teammate, and current Queen of Wakanda, [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] appeared and scolded them both, stating cryptically that "You are both going to have to learn that you cannot kill one another without killing yourselves!"{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 #51}}

[[File:Wolverine Vol 3 50 Wraparound Textless.jpg|right|thumb|Sabretooth and Wolverine's Last Battle?]]

Later, Sabretooth was chained in the royal palace of Wakanda complaining about the way he was being treated. He soon broke free and escaped into the jungle, with the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] quickly giving chase. He caught up to Sabretooth and engaged him in battle, with Sabretooth gaining the upper hand. Sabretooth wrapped his right hand around the Panther's throat and hoisted him off the ground and was about to deal a killing blow when Wolverine suddenly arrived. Without hesitation, Wolverine used his claws to slice off Sabretooth's hand resulting in Sabretooth's imprisonment shortly thereafter.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 52}}

But in the midst of the night Sabretooth was extracted by an agent of [[Romulus (Earth-616)|Romulus]], [[Kyle Gibney (Earth-616)|Wild Child]], and escaped from Wakanda. Sabretooth was then replaced with [[Victor Creed Clones (Romulus) (Earth-616)|a feral clone created by Romulus]] who was put into stasis in an old Weapon X facility.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 310}} Wild Child then lured Wolverine to this facility where he found this clone of Sabretooth. Wolverine noticed that something wasn't right with this Sabretooth, but before he could do anything the clone attacked him on sight and later on killed [[Maria Callasantos (Earth-616)|Feral]] before fleeing.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 54}}

Still thinking this clone was the real Sabretooth, Wolverine decided that it was finally time to put an end to Sabretooth and approached [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], asking for the [[Muramasa Blade]]. After mentally showing Emma Frost all the atrocities Sabretooth had committed, Cyclops consented and gave the sword to Wolverine. Wolverine chased the Sabretooth clone down and used the sword to slice off his arm. The Sabretooth clone then attempted to reattach it but in vain because of the Muramasa Blade's ability to nullify healing factors, and as a result he was left vulnerable. Wolverine then offered him one last chance to stop him, but the Sabretooth clone, fighting his programming, managed to only say "Do it" and Wolverine seemingly decapitated and killed him.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 55}}

Now believed to be dead to the eyes of the world, the real Sabretooth went into hiding in order to train and to prepare for the next phase of his plan.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 311}}

====Becoming the Invisible King of Asia====

[[File:Victor Creed (Earth-616) from Wolverine Vol 4 20 001.jpg|thumb|left|Sabretooth back in action]]
After some time in hiding, Sabretooth decided to kidnap [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] and forced [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] to free Romulus from the [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]] Dimension. Once done he attacked Wolverine at the old Weapon X facility and defeated him with the help of several of his clones created by Romulus.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 310}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 311}} Afterward, Sabretooth decided to go to Romulus's fortress in Italy where Romulus was undergoing the adamantium bonding process, but Wolverine with the help of Romulus' twin sister, [[Remus (Earth-616)|Remus]], followed him there. Sabretooth fought Wolverine but was defeated and Wolverine then confronted Romulus.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 312}}

But Sabretooth wasn't done: he teamed up with Romulus and together they were able to overpower Wolverine and were about to kill him until Cloak, Dagger, and Remus arrived to save Wolverine. Knowing he was outnumbered, Sabretooth switched to his "Plan B" and activated a bomb which blew up Romulus' fortress. Thanks to the explosion Sabretooth was able to escape, while Romulus was captured and imprisoned at the [[Raft]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 313}}

[[File:Victor Creed (Earth-616) from Wolverine Vol 2 301 001.jpg|thumb|right|Rising to the top!]]

His business with Romulus done, Sabretooth went to Japan where he worked for the Japanese branch of The Hand and for its leader [[Azuma Gōda (Earth-616)|Azuma Gōda]], together with the newly revived [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] with whom he again had a relationship. However, Creed betrayed Azuma Gōda and left him to be killed by Wolverine, after telling him that he had returned to be much more than he was before falling off the grid. He then proceeded to travel to a meeting of East Asia's greatest crime syndicates and killed all of the representatives, declaring himself invisible king of all Asia, and ruling with Mystique, [[Lord Deathstrike (Earth-616)|Lord Deathstrike]], and the new [[Shingen Harada II (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #300|303}}

Shortly after, he was asked by the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] to kill [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] and [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]] aboard [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]]'s [[Peak VII|space station]],{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 8}} helped train [[Kade Kilgore (Earth-616)|Kade Kilgore]],{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 24}} and later acted as a consultant for the [[Hellfire Academy (Earth-616)|Hellfire Academy]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 31|35}}

====[[Final Execution]]====

[[File:Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 32 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Sabretooth's twisted revenge against Wolverine]]

He also joined the new [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] formed by a newly resurrected [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]]. Together with fellow Brotherhood member [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-295)|Blob]] they kidnapped [[Evan Sabahnur (Earth-616)|Evan Sabahnur]] in order to turn him into their own [[Apocalypse]]. Sabretooth, Daken, and [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] took Evan on a road trip in an effort to break his resolve and turn him into Apocalypse. In an illusion created by Shadow King, they killed his parents but when he still refused to kill him they revealed that his parents never existed and were only illusions created by [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #25|30}}

The Brotherhood was still unable to break Evan's will and were eventually stopped by [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]], and Wolverine had to kill his own son, Daken, in order to protect the lives of his students. After he killed his son, a triumphant Sabretooth appeared and revealed that all of what happened was his plan all along, as he wanted to hurt Logan in the worst way possible. An angry Evan almost killed Sabretooth but he was able to escape after Wolverine told Evan to let him go, as revenge would only lead him to a path of destruction just like what happened here.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #31|34}}

====Losing his empire====

[[File:Victor Creed (Earth-616) and Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 16 001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Sabretooth being shot by Magneto before having a building collapse on him]]

In the aftermath of the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|conflict between the Avengers and the X-Men]], Mystique brought together Sabretooth and [[Regan Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Lady Mastermind]] with the purpose of reforming the Brotherhood,{{r|All-New X-Men #9}} committing numerous heists, and using Lady Mastermind's illusions to incriminate the [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|time-displaced X-Men]],{{r|All-New X-Men #12}} who were recently brought to the present by [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]].{{r|All-New X-Men #1}} Creed questioned Mystique's actions, as they had already stolen more money than they would ever need.{{r|All-New X-Men #12}} She eventually revealed her plans to buy the entirety of Madripoor from [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], but the X-Men arrived in time to break up the deal and defeated Sabretooth and the rest of the Brotherhood. Sabretooth managed to escape, as did Mystique.{{r|All-New X-Men #14}}

With the money they stole in the heists, Mystique eventually succeeded in acquiring Madripoor from Hydra and attempted to turn it into a [[Homo superior|mutant]] sanctuary. Raven, posing as [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]], attracted [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] to the island, and showed him her plans. However, Magneto reacted violently to the plan, believing that Mystique and the others were traitors to their species, in part due to allowing the use of [[Mutant Growth Hormone]] to run rampant in the streets to fund their operations. He heavily injured Sabretooth and the Brotherhood, and left after making their base collapse.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 16}}

[[File:Wolverine Vol 5 13 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Breaking the Wolverine]]

Shortly after Sabretooth heard the news that Logan lost his healing factor, he decided to send Mystique to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School For Higher Learning]] to steal one of Wolverine's swords and to deliver a message to him in order to lure Logan to the place where he was born: the old [[Howlett Estate|Howlett Estate]].{{r|{{cl|Wolverine Vol 5 8}}-[[Wolverine Vol 5 9|9]]}} At the same time he put a bounty on Logan's head that attracted [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc the Leaper]] and he used the villain [[Fiber (Earth-616)|Fiber]] to make sure that each wound Logan sustained afterwards would make his body flinch. Once Logan reached his destination, Victor used his ninja army, Mystique, Lord Deathstrike, and the Silver Samurai to break Logan. Sabretooth appeared in the end and beat Wolverine to a pulp and left him broken both physically and mentally.{{r|Wolverine Vol 5 10|13}}

After his victory, Sabretooth decided to steal a strange sphere of incommensurable power in Madripoor.{{r|{{cl|Wolverine Vol 6 1}}-[[Wolverine Vol 6 9|9]]}}. Sabretooth's goal was to swap [[Earth-616|his reality]] for another one in order to create a new primal world where there were no technology, no rules, and no powers that weren't physical. This world would benefit the strongest and in there Sabretooth would be a god.{{r|Wolverine Vol 6 10}} His plans failed when Mystique, Lord Deathstrike, the Silver Samurai, and the Hand were defeated by Wolverine and his allies.{{r|Wolverine Vol 6 11}} After his army fell, Sabretooth was ultimately defeated by Wolverine and taken into [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.{{r|Wolverine Vol 6 12}}

====The Death of Wolverine====

[[File:Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616) from Death of Wolverine Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|right|Prisoner of Viper]]

Viper managed to snatch Sabretooth from S.H.I.E.L.D., take him back to Madripoor, poisoned him, and kept him as a prisoner. When Logan decided to go to Madripoor to know more about the bounty on his head he found a chained Sabretooth. Victor was then forced to fight against Logan, otherwise Viper's poison would have killed him.{{r|Death of Wolverine Vol 1 1|2}} Without any healing factor, Wolverine didn't stand a chance against Sabretooth, who took out one of his eyes but Logan was saved by Lady Deathstrike. As Lady Deathstrike was about to strike a fatal blow to Victor, Logan asked her to spare his life.{{r|Death of Wolverine Vol 1 2}}

Finally free, Sabretooth was attacked by [[Sharp (Earth-616)|Sharp]] and his team.{{r|Death of Wolverine: The Weapon X Program Vol 1 3}} He resumed his mercenary career in [[Somalia]] but after learning the news about Logan's death, he became more and more unstable.{{r|Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy Vol 1 3}} He was then captured by Sharp (now calling himself "Shogun") and his team and transported to [[Croatia]] where he was kept obedient thanks to some control words.{{r|Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy Vol 1 1}} Because of those control words, Sabretooth had no choice but to help Shogun and his team retrieve Wolverine's dead body.{{r|{{cl|Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy Vol 1 1}}-[[Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy Vol 1 7|7]]}}

===The Inversion===
====Avengers Unity Division====

[[File:Uncanny Avengers Vol 2 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|The Inverted Sabretooth as part of the Avengers Unity Division]]

Sabretooth was among the villains recruited by Magneto to help fight [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Onslaught]]'s [[Stark Sentinels]].{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #2}} When [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] and the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] cast an inversion spell to alter the moral compass of the Red Skull and defeat him, the inversion spell had a stronger effect than expected, affecting all those on the island, including Sabretooth, who became heroic.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #3}}

Sabretooth rejoined the group of (now-inverted) villains in order to fight the inverted X-Men, who were planning on detonating a gene bomb to kill every non-mutant on the planet.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #6}} Sabretooth later helped [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]] prepare the White Skull (the inverted version of the Red Skull) to re-invert the heroes, even though he knew if they were successful, he would go back to his evil ways. However, Sabretooth was close to [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] when the reinversion happened and Stark had devised a shielding which protected him from the reinversion, which also prevented Sabretooth from becoming evil again. Still heroic, Sabretooth decided to follow Wolverine's example and try to do good, but before that, he turned himself over to the authorities to pay for the crimes he had committed.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #9}}

After the events of the World War Hate, Sabretooth joined the reformed [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]] and traveled to [[Counter-Earth (High Evolutionary)|Counter-Earth]] with the team to find [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]. While the other members were scattered across Counter-Earth, Sabretooth found himself on one of the Counter-Earth's main cities, where he was quickly taken down by the [[New Men]], and later controlled to obey the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 2 1}}

After escaping the Evolutionary's experimentation, the twins found Rogue, and alongside her they joined the fight to defend [[Lowtown (Counter-Earth)|Lowtown]] from the High Evolutionary. During the battle, Sabretooth broke free from the Evolutionary's control. Captain America also appeared on the scene after the [[Green Ones|tree-like creatures]] had been summoned to battle, but overcame his transformation and fought for Lowtown. [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] saved the Scarlet Witch from [[Luminous (Earth-616)|Luminous]] after having abandoned [[Eve (Android) (Earth-616)|Eve]], and the High Evolutionary was heavily damaged once [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Doctor Voodoo]] attacked him with the souls of those he had exterminated. Pietro delivered the final beating to the High Evolutionary, and forced him to flee through a portal along with Luminous. Once the dust settled, the Avengers Unity Division returned to Earth.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 2 5}}

====The Wolverines====
Shortly after, now part of the [[Wolverines (Earth-616)|Wolverines]] team, he went after the body of Wolverine stolen by Sinister. He and the rest of the team managed to infiltrate Sinister's stronghold, but Logan's body was finally retrieved by the X-Men.{{r|Wolverines Vol 1 1|6}} After that he met [[Fang (Imperial Guard) (Earth-616)|Fang]] who wanted to avenge Logan's death, but despite his incredible powers, the team managed to defeat him.{{r|Wolverines Vol 1 7|12}}

[[File:Wolverines Vol 1 1 Howard Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|The Wolverines team]]

The team was then betrayed by [[Meifeng (Earth-616)|Endo]], [[Harold Stanch (Earth-616)|Neuro]], and [[Skel (Simpson) (Earth-616)|Skel]] and had to face against Sinister and his army. In the midst of the battle one of the control words was used and Sabretooth turned feral and killed [[Daniel Silva (Earth-616)|Junk]]. Fortunately Shogun managed to release him from his control words and Victor regained his sanity.{{r|Wolverines Vol 1 13|18}} Shortly after the team was betrayed by Mystique who stripped Sabretooth's of his healing factor with [[Siphon (Earth-616)|Siphon]]'s intervention.{{r|{{cl|Wolverines Vol 1 19}}-[[Wolverines Vol 1 20|20]]}} The effect proved to be temporary, as Victor's powers would be displayed working properly afterwards.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 1}}

====Weapon X====
During the [[M-Pox]] crisis, Sabretooth joined [[X-Men (Magneto's) (Earth-616)|Magneto's X-Men]], with the goal of protecting mutant-kind at any cost.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 1}} Though she was initially distant towards him,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 6}} Victor became close with his teammate [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|M]]. As a result of their odd relationship, Sabretooth left the X-Men with her after learning that she had become possessed by her vampiric brother [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]] in order to help keep her condition a secret and find a way to cure her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 17}} However, he left her when she became too evil.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 24}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 17 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Sabretooth and Monet "torturous love"]]

Victor was one of several mutants that became targets of the resurfaced [[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X]] as part of the organization's process to refine their mutant-hunting cyborgs.{{r|X-Men Prime Vol 2 1}}{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 1}} Victor eventually joined forces with a time-displaced older version of [[James Howlett (Earth-21923)|Logan]] and [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] to investigate their attackers.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 2}}{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 3}} In the process of shutting down Weapon X, these mutants were joined by [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]] and [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]], whom Sabretooth and his allies rescued from containment.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 4}} [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|William Stryker]] was behind this new Weapon X project and with the help of [[Aliana Alba (Earth-616)|Doctor Alba]] they created a new weapon by combining the DNA of the members of the team and [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus Cho a.k.a The Totally Awesome Hulk]], something called [[Clayton Cortez (Earth-616)|Weapon H]]. Following the destruction of the Weapon X facility where Weapon H had been created, the team of mutants turned their alliance into a mutant-rescue squad, and started by taking back the name [[Weapon X-Force (Earth-616)|Weapon X]].{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 22}}{{r|[[Weapons of Mutant Destruction]]}}

[[File:Weapon X Vol 3 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Weapon X]]

After finding Weapon H, the team was beaten by this new weapon during their first battle,{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 7|8}} and soon after they discovered that Stryker had also been beat down by this new weapon after being betrayed by Doctor Alba. Stryker survived his encounter with Weapon H because he had been transformed into a cyborg previously, he then decided to help the team locate Weapon H as a revenge against Doctor Alba.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 9}} With the help of their new prisoner, the team was able to locate Weapon H{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 10}} and broke Alba's control over him. Now free, Weapon H escaped while Doctor Alba was handed to the X-Men and kept as a prisoner but during the battle with Weapon H, Stryker escaped and started a small church afterwards.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 11}}

Not long after the team went to [[Santo Marco (Country)|Santo Marco]] in order to deal with its dictator [[Emilio Duarte (Earth-616)|Emilio Duarte]] and his [[Nuke Platoon (Earth-616)|Nuke Platoon]] who were exterminating mutants and mutant sympathizers.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 11}} Along the way, the team came across [[Frank Simpson (Earth-616)|Nuke]] and discovered the supply factory of the Nuke Platoon.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 12}} After being betrayed by Nuke,{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 13}} the team was forced to take the [[Adrenaline Pills|Nuke pills]] in order to face Nuke and his platoon before blowing up the factory while Nuke escaped and assassinated Duarte putting an end to this threat. Afterwards, Lady Deathstrike revealed to Sabretooth that she decided to keep some of the pills used by the Nuke Platoon for herself in case she didn't want to play a hero anymore, Sabretooth smiled at this reveal and agreed with her.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 14}}

Shortly after Sabretooth alongside Old Man Logan, Domino, Laura Kinney and Warpath were called by Kitty Pryde to investigate the return of Jean Grey. The team then went to the North Pole where they were confronted by a construct of the original Wolverine who defeated all of them before confronting Old Man Logan. But as the two "Wolverine" were about to fight, this Wolverine construct disappeared,{{r|Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 1}} the team then reported what happened to Kitty Pryde and understood that the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] was involved. The team was then sent to the ruins of [[Genosha]]{{r|Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 2}} and later to the ruins of [[Mexico]]{{r|Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 3|4}} where they witnessed the return of Jean Grey to the land of the living.{{r|Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 5}}

====[[Orphans of X (Story Arc)|Orphans of X]]====
Shortly after, Sabretooth and others people whose powers were similar to Wolverine such as Laura Kinney, Old Man Logan and Daken came under threat of the clandestine organization called [[Orphans of X (Earth-616)|The Orphans of X]].{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 25}} Sabretooth, Lady Deathstrike, Daken and Old Man Logan were captured and executed by the Orphans of X with bullets created with the metal of the [[Muramasa Blade]] that could nullify their healing factor.{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 28}} The bullets were later removed by Laura Kinney, resulting in their resurrection and after discovering the reasons behind the Orphans of X's hatred of them, Laura managed to reason with them and reach an armistice.{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 30}}

====The Hunt for Wolverine====

[[File:Hunt for Wolverine Claws of a Killer Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|A deadly hunt]]

After hearing reports that Logan might be alive, Sabretooth teamed up with Lady Deathstrike and Daken to investigate. The trio went to [[Maybelle (Arizona)|Maybelle]] and discovered that a company named Soteira was conducting experiments there and as the result the town was infested with [[Zombies]].{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer Vol 1 1}} Victor discovered that his healing factor wasn't working and that the bites of those zombies could be lethal to him.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer Vol 1 2}} On top of zombies, a Soteira kill team composed of two soldiers attacked the trio. Much to Victor's surprise one of the soldiers was revealed to be his dead son: Graydon Creed.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer Vol 1 3}}

While fighting Graydon, Victor discovered that his son wasn't fighting like he used to, he was only a puppet controlled by someone else and he was only repeating the same words over and over: "You will be useful". After Lady Deathstrike stabbed Graydon in the neck, Sabretooth found a strange green glowing device responsible for suppressing his healing factor.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Claws of a Killer Vol 1 4}} Running out of time after learning that the town was about to be burned to the ground by Soteira, Victor destroyed the device, and as a result his healing powers returned. The next day Victor and Yuriko hijacked a car and left town. Because he wanted to atone for his past sins, Victor contacted Kitty Pryde and he gave her the details of what happened in Maybelle.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Dead Ends Vol 1 1}}

====Weapon X-Force====

[[File:Weapon X Vol 3 22 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Sabretooth's Weapon X Force team]]

Due to his ailing health, Logan ceded field leadership of Weapon X to Sabretooth, feeling that despite his brutal ways, his heart was in the right place. For the team's first mission without him on the field, Logan deployed Weapon X in [[Siberia]] to kill Omega Red, who had taken over the [[Stranniy Corrective Labor Camp]] for mutants.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 17}} Instead of killing Omega Red, Sabretooth decided to form an alliance with him to take down the person pulling his strings, Omega Red's estranged brother and director of [[S.I.C.K.L.E. (Earth-616)|S.I.C.K.L.E.]], [[Vassily Rossovich (Earth-616)|Vassily Rossovich]].{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 18}} Warpath quit the team, and tried to stop the rest of his teammates from helping Omega Red take down S.I.C.K.L.E., fearing an international conflict could result from it.{{r|{{cl|Weapon X Vol 3 19}}-[[Weapon X Vol 3 20|20]]}} Following Director Rossovich's death, the rest of Weapon X effectively cut ties with Logan. They decided to become mercenaries together with Omega Red, and in the process rebranded themselves as "Weapon X-Force."{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 21}}

After weeks of successful operations, Victor convinced the team to help him rescue Monet, who had fallen under the influence of a cult secretly led by [[Marvin Flumm (Earth-616)|Mentallo]]. They managed to extract her from the villain's mind control,{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 22}} and subsequently joined forces with [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] to take down the cult, whose true leader was revealed to be [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|William Stryker]], the former director of Weapon X.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 23}} The group was placed in a prison and released into an arena to do battle with various other mind-controlled mutants. Victor came up with the plan of using their [[Adrenaline Pills|Nuke pills]] to free everyone from Mentallo's hold, which successfully turned the tables on their foes. Though triumphant, Victor encouraged everyone to kill Stryker, an easy task due to the damage Stryker took in the battle. However, as he died and descended to [[Hell]], he vowed to return for Weapon X-Force. Wanting to stop his return from the grave, Weapon X-Force decided to make their way into Hell to kill him once and for all. To do so, they went to see [[Azazel (Earth-616)|Azazel]], who could grant them access. He initially refused to help due to jealousy of Mystique working with Sabretooth, another man who fathered a child with her.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 #24|25}}

After a brief fight, Azazel agreed to help. Victor was the first to be sent to Hell after being decapitated by Azazel. He woke up in a hospital where he eventually found Graydon, whom he decided to bring with him. He reunited with his team and they encountered [[Marduk Kurios (Earth-616)|Marduk Kurios]], who seemed content to let them continue their mission. He pointed them in the direction of Stryker's castle and gave warning to kill him before his resurrection by the cult. They were shown a vision of Mentallo, sacrificing cult members for Stryker's revival.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 26}} Victor ordered everyone to return to Azazel and be teleported to [[Aspen (Colorado)|Aspen]] to stop the cult.

[[File:Weapon X Vol 3 27 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|The end of the Inverted Sabretooth's saga.]]

They returned from Hell successfully only for Mentallo to receive a power boost from Stryker that made him powerful enough to instantly bring down Weapon X-Force. Seeing his team in danger, Victor abandoned his fight with Stryker to save them. He decided to lose his mind and free the beast to save his team. Overwhelmed, Mentallo shot Victor with Domino's gun, which sent him into the pit as Stryker's final sacrifice. In retaliation, Deathstrike delivered the fatal strike to Mentallo while Monet mourned Victor's death. Reentering Hell, Victor decapitated Stryker which completed his mission and effectively ended his revival. Sabretooth used his sacrifice to allow Graydon to be reborn instead, fulfilling his earlier promise to save his son. When Marduk encountered Victor again, he was completely feral and unable to speak. Marduk didn't want to claim Victor while he was mentally compromised and unable to comprehend his situation. He opened a door to the living world and released the feral Sabretooth into the [[Saskatchewan]] woods, telling him to embrace his true self and earn his way back to Hell.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 27}}

====[[War of the Realms]]====

[[File:War of the Realms Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Sabretooth is back for revenge!]]

When the [[Dark Elves|Dark Elf]] [[Malekith (Earth-616)|Malekith]] invaded the Earth as part of his plan to conquer all [[Glossary:Ten Realms|Ten Realms]], Victor allied himself with his forces in hopes he would be granted a country of his own to rule.{{r|War of the Realms: Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 2}} He ultimately failed and was beheaded by [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] who subsequently sent his head to another dimension.{{r|War of the Realms: Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 3}}

===A Brave New World===
====House of X====

[[File:Victor Creed (Earth 616) from House of X Vol 1 3 001.jpg|thumb|left|Sabretooth trialed for his crimes]]

Shortly after Charles Xavier established a mutant nation in [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], Sabretooth was returned to life by the [[Five (Earth-616)|Five]]. Together with Mystique and Toad, he broke into [[Damage Control (Earth-616)|Damage Control]] in order to steal data on Xavier's behalf, but was apprehended by the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] while Mystique and Toad got away. Cyclops came to claim him on grounds of amnesty but left him behind when [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]] refused.{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}} Creed later stood trial for his crimes at Project Achilles, being charged with theft, two counts of manslaughter, and assault. A remorseless Creed plead guilty to all charges and noted he wasn't done killing yet. However, the White Queen came to claim him on grounds of diplomatic immunity and threatened the humans into releasing Creed into their custody. Opting to leave his shackles on, Emma and the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Cuckoos]] took him back to Krakoa.{{r|House of X Vol 1 3}}

====A Life Sentence====

[[File:Victor Creed (Earth-616) from House of X Vol 1 6 001.png|thumb|right|End of the line for Sabretooth]]

When Creed was returned to Krakoa, he faced another trial among the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council]] which consisted of Storm, Xavier, Magneto, Emma, Jean, Sinister, Nightcrawler, Apocalypse, Exodus, and Mystique. The Council established three new core laws of Krakoa, one of which forbid the murder of humans. Creed was defiant as ever during the trial and Xavier offered him a chance for redemption or to be used as an example for what would happens when their laws were broken. As a result, the still defiant Creed was swallowed up by Krakoa, below the surface where he would be trapped in a state of permanent stasis for the rest of his life, or until the Council had need of him, while completely conscious and mentally aware.{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}}

| Powers                  =

'''[[Homo superior|Enhanced Mutant Physiology]]:''' Sabretooth is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] who had been given artificial enhancements on multiple occasions by various backers.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}} The [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]] classified him as a '''Severe Threat'''.{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files Vol 1 1}}
*'''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Sabretooth's primary mutant power is an accelerated healing process that enables him to regenerate most (if not all) damaged or destroyed areas of his anatomy with far greater efficiency than an ordinary human. The rate of regeneration is proportional to the damage caused. This process is automatic and Sabretooth seems to have no control over it. His healing factor, however, does not seem to stop Sabretooth from feeling the pain of his wounds nor the pain of his body regenerating itself.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}}
** '''Contaminant Immunity:''' Sabretooth's natural healing also affords him the virtual immunity to poisons, viruses, diseases, and most drugs.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}}
** '''Fatigue Resistance:''' Sabretooth is partially resistant to fatigue poisons produced from physical activity.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files Vol 1 1}}

* '''Superhuman Senses:''' Sabretooth possess superhuman senses including sight, hearing, smell and taste but not known if his sense of touch has also been heightened. These senses allow him to track prey similar to dogs.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}}
**'''Sight:''' Sabretooth has enhanced night vision due to containing twice the average number of retina in his eyes. This also allows to see in the infra-red as well as visible spectrum.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}} However, due to his more animalistic nature he may be colorblind{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #9}}
**'''Hearing:''' Sabretooth has extraordinarily accurate hearing as he could hear light breathing from 200 ft away.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}}
**'''Smell:''' Sabretooth has a highly developed olfactory sense and memory allow him to detect and track a scent over 8 hours old with a concentration of 20 parts per million.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}}
**'''Taste:''' Sabretooth can detect 1 part in 10,000 with his sense of taste.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}}
* '''Claws:''' Sabretooth has claws on each of his fingers and toes, even before they were infused with [[Adamantium]] they could penetrate most flesh and many natural materials. After augmentation, his bones became indestructible and his claws are capable of tearing through any material.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}}
*'''Fangs: ''' Sabretooth posses’ animal like canine teeth which are capable of chewing through substances as strong as bone.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #9}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}}
*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Sabretooth’s reinforced skeleton allowing him to withstand high levels of physical pressure. His strength is also boosted to enhanced levels, allowing him to briefly lift over 800 lbs.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}
* '''Superhuman Speed:''' Sabretooth has speed greater than a trained human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 4}} Easily able to dispatch gunman with relative ease before they pull the trigger or get a proper shot in.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1  134}} Dodge point blank gunfire from expert marksmen like Frank Castle aka The Punisher.{{r|Spider-Man, Punisher, Sabertooth: Designer Genes Vol 1 1}}
* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Sabretooth's healing factor grants him superhuman stamina and is partially immune to fatigue toxins generated by physical exertion and thus has greater endurance than actual humans.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files Vol 1 1}} His stamina has been described as metahuman{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 4}}
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' Sabretooth has superhuman durability due a combination of his healing factor and Adamantium skeleton.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files Vol 1 1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 4}}
* '''Enhanced Reflexes and Agility:'''{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files Vol 1 1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 4}} Sabretooth's reflexes and agility are enhanced, being able to dodge enemy attacks. His reflexes are three times as swift as a normal person{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #9}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Powers
| body  = 
'''Psionic Resistance:''' Sabretooth became temporarily immune to telepathic manipulation after an incident where Wolverine punctured his frontal lobe. When Elizabeth Braddock stabbed him with her psi-blade it seemingly had no effect in the sense that it should have reverted him via what he called "The Glow", which normally allowed his more reasonable side to take control over the animal, which failed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 328}} For at least a time afterward he became far more difficult to locate or read via telepathy, though this was shown to be a temporary resistance as both Jean Grey and Professor Xavier were able to eventually both locate, sense and enter his mind.{{r|Sabretooth Special #1}}
}}

| Abilities               = 
'''Hand-to-Hand Combat Expert''': Sabretooth is an excellent hand to hand combatant, having been trained by various organizations. Creed was made into a highly skilled soldier and warrior with expertise in various fighting forms, having been trained by the [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|CIA]], [[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X]], [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] and the [[Foreigner]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}}

'''Master Tracker''': He is also an expert hunter and tracker, even without the use of his heightened senses. Due to his superhuman sense, Sabretooth is an extraordinary tracker.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files Vol 1 1}}

'''Cunning Intellect''': Although his brutish nature coupled with extreme arrogance gives him the appearance of stupidity, Creed actually has quite the acumen being well above average level intelligence.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 4}} One credited to, in his own words, two centuries worth of experience.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 18}} Routinely hacking into government databases to steal classified information and easily escaping from the highest levels of incarceration.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 ½}} More than once he has proven himself capable in the brain over brawn aspect, able to dupe the likes of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]] into playing step by step into his ploys, or besting super geniuses such as [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Sinister]] and his creations.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 28}}

'''Expert Marksman''': Being a skilled cloak & dagger specialist with decades of spymaster practice under his belt,{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 52}} Sabretooth is an adept sharpshooter with just about any kind of firearm he can get his hands on.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 15}}{{r|Sabretooth: Mary Shelley Overdrive Vol 1 2}}

'''Avid Manipulator''': Another note to his intelligence is that Creed excels at scheming, planning and coaxing others into doing his dirty work for him, or pushing them into doing things that they don't realize are for his benefit.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 34}}

'''Advanced Covert Ops Specialist''': Having spent many centuries working for secret societies and "officially unsanctioned" government installations,{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 26}} Sabretooth has amassed an impressive conglomerate of knowledge base on countless surreptitious interested powers and their numerous tactics regarding assassination techniques, weapons specialty, vehicles, explosives, espionage, intelligence, black bag ops, infiltration, the works.{{r|Sabretooth: Mary Shelley Overdrive Vol 1 2}}

'''Special Skills:''' He possesses a pronounced assault leap, which few can sense, even those like Wolverine who have animal senses. This leap is a combination of his great strength, speed, reflexes and agility working in concert; flexing and un-flexing his muscles much harder and quicker than a normal human, similar to a tiger or lion's pounce.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 4}} This allows for a devastatingly powerful and fast leap onto the opponent, which few can recover from.

| Weaknesses              = 

Due to the similarities between his and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]’s powers, he likely shares a similar set of weaknesses:
* '''Muramasa Blade:''' Sabretooth was vulnerable to the [[Muramasa Blade]]. The sword, which was constructed through some means with the use of a piece of Wolverine's own soul, had the ability to greatly nullify the efficiency of an accelerated healing factor. Later the blade was broken and a piece of it was stolen by Daken and laced to the underside of his two wrists' bone claws, similar to his father's bonding process, by Phineas Mason (Tinkerer). Logan later removed the pieces of the Muramasa blade from Daken's arms and buried them with the rest of the blade in an unmarked grave near the Howlett Estate in Alberta. After Logan's death, Laura Kinney and Carol Danvers were tricked into revealing the location of the blade and its fragments to the Orphans of X who melted it down and forged it into several bullets.{{Citation}}
* '''Carbonadium Poisoning:''' Sabretooth's healing factor can be dramatically slowed if Carbonadium is implanted inside of him, such as swallowing something made of Carbonadium or being wounded by a bullet composed of it. It causes his healing factor to be reduced to a slow crawl, at least in comparison to its normal speed, but doesn't fully suppress it.{{citation}}
*'''Vulnerable Senses:''' Sabretooth's his heightened senses can be taken advantage of.{{citation}}
*'''Memory Issues:''' Likely due to his healing factor, Sabretooth has gone large periods of life without memories of certain traumatic events.{{citation}}
*'''Drowning:''' Of the few ways to kill Sabretooth, given drowning cuts the brain's oxygen supply, as well as the addition of nearly 100 pounds of Adamantium to his body reduced his buoyancy.{{Citation}}
*'''Adamantium Poisoning:''' Adamantium has proven to secrete poison which stunts Sabretooth's healing factor and feral rage by a very small degree. Even though he has it laced throughout his entire body it has not made a significant change in his abilities. However, the poisoning will endanger Sabretooth's life if his healing factor fails on him, such as when an inhibitor field cancels out his mutant powers.{{Citation}}
*'''Decapitation/Severe Spinal Damage:''' Sabretooth can be killed if his head becomes separated from his body, causing his brain to be unable to send signals to the section(s) of his body that needs healing.{{Citation}}

| Equipment               = * '''Adamantium Laced Skeleton''': Several times Sabretooth has had his natural mutation boosted by having his bones and claws laced with the indestructible synthetic metal known as adamantium. Once he had been implanted by [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] but soon forcefully forfeited it back to him, who then transplanted it back into Logan{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}}The second time he had his bones bonded was when [[Weapon X|Weapon X]] had been reinstated and captured him to commence with said molecular lacing procedure as well as kick his strength, speed and healing factor up a notch.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}} Due to the Scarlet Witch's [[House of M|Reality Warp]] it was unsure if Sabretooth kept his adamantium skeleton, but it was confirmed that he still has his adamantium-laced skeleton.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 3}}
| Transportation          = 
| Weapons                 = * '''Adamantium-Laced Claws:''' This varies or depends on whose the writer, Sabretooth's claws, along with his skeleton, have been bonded with adamantium. As a result, his claws were virtually indestructible. The adamantium further enhanced the already razor sharp edge of Sabretooth's claws and enabled him to slice through almost any surface.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 1}}

| Notes                   = * [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] created clones of all of the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] using genetic material he had gathered from all of them.
** Sabretooth's cloning partner in the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] is [[Janos Quested (Earth-616)|Riptide]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 34}}
** At one point, Sinister claimed he was unable to clone Sabretooth anymore, and wanted another genetic sample.{{r|Gambit Vol 3 #9}} However, he later managed to clone vast troops of [[Sabretooth]] Hounds while in [[Sinister London]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 #14|17}}
* Creed has been stated to be a psychopath{{r|Sabretooth and Mystique #1}}{{r|Sabretooth and Mystique #4}}{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 2 6}} and a sociopath.{{r|Sabretooth and Mystique #2}} Since the "inversion" event, this no longer appears to be the case, though he eventually relapsed.
* Sabretooth seems to have comic awareness, as he knew that [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] was based on [[w:c:dc:Deathstroke|Deathstroke]], a DC Comics mercenary.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 34}}
| Trivia                  = * Sabretooth actually began his career as an [[Iron Fist]] villain.{{r|Iron Fist #14}}
* The DC Comics super-villain [[w:c:dc:Tracer (New Earth)|Tracer]] of The [[w:c:dc:Extremists (New Earth)|Extremists]] is based on Sabretooth.
* Sabretooth's physical strength has been artificially enhanced at least twice. Sabretooth received his first strength enhancement from his son, Graydon Creed, during the mini-series [[Sabretooth Vol 1|Sabretooth: Death Hunt]]. Sabretooth's strength was further enhanced later after joining the latest incarnation of the Weapon X Program.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #166}}
* Although Sabretooth was a proud killer, his animal tendencies sometimes overwhelmed him.{{r|Daredevil #238}} To stay in control, he forced a telepath named Birdy to routinely give him "The Glow", a psychic sedative effect that helped manage his animal side.{{r|{{cl|Sabretooth Vol 1 1}}-[[Sabretooth Vol 1 4|4]]}} When Birdy was killed, the withdrawal symptoms made Creed's animal side more uncontrollable than ever, and he sought psionic treatment from the X-Men. After Wolverine poked a claw through his brain, however, Creed's personality regenerated as a purer fusion of animal and man, making him at least temporarily more resistant to psychic powers, though both Jean Grey and Professor Xavier were able to eventually overcome this.{{r|Sabretooth Special #1}}
* During ''[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 4|Uncanny X-Men]]'', Sabretooth developed a close relationship with Monet St. Croix which writer [[Cullen Bunn|Cullen Bunn]] confirmed was a torturous love.{{r|{{cite web|url= https://twitter.com/cullenbunn/status/1009239337588940803|title= That was some torturous love.|work= Twitter|last= Bunn|first= Cullen|date= June 20, 2018|accessdate= December 23, 2018}}}}
* Before the cancellation of ''Uncanny X-Men'', Cullen Bunn had a larger story planned for Sabretooth's fall back into villainy, which was going to be serve as a metaphor for Alzheimer's, which Bunn had lost his father to.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://cullenbunn.tumblr.com/post/182788960044/youve-mentioned-that-you-expect-to-be-done-with|title=Ending One 2nd @ a Time, You've mentioned that you expect to be done with...|work=Tumblr|first=Cullen|last=Bunn|date=13 February 2019|accessdate=13 February 2019}}}}
