===Early Life===
William Baker was the son of [[Floyd Baker (Earth-616)|Floyd Baker]] and his [[Mrs. Baker (Earth-616)|wife]]. William's father left while William was an infant.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}}{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #86}} As a child, impoverished, he learned how to steal.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #86}} Young William loved going to the beach and building sand castles, but trips to the beach were far and few between because his mother was an alcoholic. One day, William built a large and detailed sand castle only to watch it wash away when it started to rain. The young Baker boy became determined that he was going to make something that would last. William took his love of making things out of sand and used it for school art projects. He had developed a crush on his teacher Miss Flint, but was heart broken when he learned that she was engaged to a stockbroker. This made William believe that the only way to attract a beautiful woman was with money. Baker was tormented by an older student named Vic. On the day he learned that Miss Flint was going to be married, Vic and his friends trashed William's work and beat him up. William ran home to his mother without telling any of the school administrators what happened, and was determined to look after himself. The next time Vic and his friends tried to bully William, he fought back and easily trounced them. When he got in trouble with the school principal, William couldn't help but notice that not only were his bullies afraid of him, but girls noticed him fighting back as well. For the first time in his miserable life, William felt joy.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}} Soon enough, young William became a bully in his own right, beating up on those smaller than him.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #86}}

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) beating up his coach in Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|left|William beating up his coach{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}}]]
Soon William became friends with Vic and his goons and rapidly rose to be the leader of their gang. To sound tougher, William began calling himself Flint, after his old teacher. In high school, Baker became a football star and began dating a cheerleader named Marcy.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}} William has given two accounts of what happened next. He has stated that he accepted money from the mob to throw one of his games.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #86}} While a late recounting, William has stated that his friend Vic had racked up heavy gambling debts and threw the next game to get out of trouble.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}} Whatever the case, William's coach figured out what happened and had him expelled from school.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #86}}{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}} However, in the later account, William had stated that he violently assaulted his coach after he confronted him.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}} Flint and Vic then began committing petty crimes and started working their way up.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #86}}{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}} When Flint tried to give gifts to his mother she rejected them, having heard rumors of his criminal activities.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #86}} Arrested while making his getaway from a robbery, Flint found himself in the same prison as his father. Wanting to know who his father was, but ashamed to reveal his identity, William introduced himself as "Flint Marko". When Flint was out he, Vic and Marcy plotted heists, and when he was arrested again, he spent time with his father until the day his father was released from prison.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}}

===Becoming Sandman===
The events that led up to William Baker becoming the Sandman vary from account to account. In one telling, Flint caught Vic and Marcy having an affair. After beating up Vic, he went on a crime spree that led to yet another incarceration. Sent to [[Ryker's Island]], Flint eventually broke out of prison, causing the manhunt that led to him getting his powers.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #86}} Another states that during one of his later arrests, Flint learned that his father was released from prison and broke out in order to be with him.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}}

It was during his flight from the authorities that Flint Marko was exposed the radiation that gave him his powers. Accounts of the actual cause vary. Originally, it was stated that Flint hid from the authorities at the site where a nuclear bomb was being tested. Another account states that Marko was near the site of a nuclear reactor that detonated, and yet another states that he hid in a cave where radioactive waste was being stored.<ref>The nuclear bomb test origin was stated in both{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #4}} and {{cl|Marvel Two-In-One #86}} although the later tale states it was a device instead of a bomb. The nuclear reactor version in {{cl|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}}, and the nuclear waste story in {{cl|Giant-Size Spider-Man Vol 2 1}}. It can be assumed that the source of the Sandman's powers is subject to the [[Glossary:Sliding Timescale|Sliding Timescale]] of [[Earth-616]], that the method in which he was irradiated is topical for the date of publication.</ref> Whatever the case, after being exposed to radiation, his body interacted with the sand under his feet mutating Marko in such a way that he could turn his body into sand and manipulate each grain to shape any form he desired.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #4}}{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #86}}{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}}{{r|Giant-Size Spider-Man Vol 2 1}} Flint has stated that it was after his powers he caught Vic and Marcy together and unleashed his powers on them in a fury before fleeing, but he left them alive.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}}

===Spider-Man===
[[File:William Baker and Peter Parker (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 4 001.jpg|thumb|right|Battling Spider-Man for the first time{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #4}}]]
While on the run in New York City, Flint, now calling himself the Sandman, began a crime spree and crossed paths with the novice hero [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man battled the Sandman but was forced to flee when his mask ripped open in order to protect his secret identity. Later the Sandman decided to hide out from the law at [[Midtown High School]]. There he decided to try and force the principal to give him a high school diploma, but he refused. Baker's big mistake was choosing the high school that Spider-Man attended in his alter ego of Peter Parker. Spotting the villain, Peter slipped away and battled him as Spider-Man. Ultimately the Sandman was defeated when Spider-Man sucked up his sand form in a vacuum cleaner and left him for the authorities.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #4}} Sandman has later stated that he had intentionally allowed Spider-Man to "defeat" him as he had learned that his father was once again incarcerated. Back in prison, Flint broke himself and his father out. They then fled to Coney Island where they had the bad luck of running into Spider-Man again. This time the Sandman was outdone by nature when it started to rain. Losing his cohesion, the Sandman was felled by a bolt of lightning and was forced to flee the scene. His father regarded the Sandman as nothing more than a "good for nothing bum" and fled the scene.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Annual #1}}
 
===Villain===
====Early Exploits====
Apparently the Sandman either previously or later began dating one of the teacher at Midtown High, and returned again to try and get her to come with him while he was on the run from the law. Peter Parker once again slipped out of class to become Spider-Man and battled Marko once again. This time around Marko was defeated when Spider-Man turned on the fire sprinklers then fused him into a solid sand form with the electrical power from a [[Stark Industries]] energy generator that was being demonstrated for a science class. Flint was then taken into police custody once more.{{r|Giant-Size Spider-Man Vol 2 1}} Later, the Sandman was pulled forward in time with a number of other super-villains by the [[Orrgo (Earth-616)|Orrgo]] who was under the command of the [[Headmen (Earth-616)|Headmen]]. The Sandman and the others villains then clashed with the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] before being returned to their proper eras, apparently with no memory of the events as they were under Orrgo's control.{{r|Defenders Vol 2 10}} The Sandman escaped from prison and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] were asked to help bring him in. With most of the team busy, their youngest member the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] was dispatched to locate the villain. The Torch confronted the Sandman on the [[George Washington Bridge (Location)|George Washington Bridge]], but he managed to escape. Unable to locate Spider-Man, the Torch briefly posed as the hero in order to draw the Sandman out of hiding. Battling it out in a department store, the fire sprinklers affected the Sandman's powers, forcing him to retain human form in order to prevent washing away. Although the Torch could not flame on, he was able to waylay the Sandman with a single punch and turn him over to the authorities.{{r|Strange Tales #115}}

The Sandman dried out while being brought to the police station and managed to escape by resuming his sand form. He then continued his crime spree only to be confronted by Spider-Man again. When trying to convince Spider-Man to leave him alone failed, the Sandman easily trounced the over confident hero and continued his business. He was pursued by the authorities and even the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] but still managed to evade capture. Spider-Man later caught up with the Sandman and as the two battled it out, the wall-crawler defeated him by pushing him through a wind turbine that spread his sand particles all over the city.{{r|Untold Tales of Spider-Man #3}} 

The Sandman later joined Spider-Man foes [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]], the [[Adrian Toomes (Earth-616)|Vulture]], [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]], [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]], and [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]] in forming the [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Six]] in order to get revenge against the wall-crawler. To this end they kidnapped [[Daily Bugle]] employee [[Elizabeth Brant (Earth-616)|Betty Brant]] and Peter Parker's [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|Aunt May]] and held them hostage. Each of the Sinister Six then fought Spider-Man one-on-one, and if defeated would give a clue that would bring Spider-Man closer to the hostages. The Sandman was Spider-Man's fourth foe, battling the hero in an air-tight room. The Sandman did not reckon that Spider-Man could hold his breath longer, and passed out from lack of air. Spider-Man then advanced on and ultimately saved Betty and Aunt May from Doctor Octopus. The members of the Sinister Six were then incarcerated by the authorities.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1}}  

During a period in which Spider-Man was being branded as a coward, the Sandman went on yet another criminal rampage. When he happened to cross paths with his old foe, attacked the wall-crawler, only to be surprised when Spider-Man fled the scene.<ref>{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #18}}: [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] was being accused of being a coward after fleeing a battle with the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]] in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #17}}. The reality was that Spider-Man left the battle due to his concern over [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|Aunt May]]'s health.</ref> When the Human Torch began hunting the Sandman, the villain employed the [[Enforcers (Earth-616)|Enforcers]] to help him capture the youthful member of the Fantastic Four. By this point, Spider-Man had gotten over his apparent "cowardice" and tracked down the Sandman and the Enforcers. Freeing the Human Torch, the two heroes easily defeated the Enforcers and send the Sandman fleeing. Flint was quickly apprehended by the authorities as he was too tired from fighting Spider-Man and the Torch to use his sand shifting powers.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #18}}

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) enhanced form from Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 37.jpg|thumb|left|Enhanced form{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #37}}]]
Escaping captivity once again, the Sandman attempted another bank robbery only to be stopped by Spider-Man and [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. As Flint was being incarcerated the [[Enclave of Rogue Scholars (Earth-10737)|Enclave of Rogue Scholars]], time travelers from the future of [[Earth-10737]] appeared seeking to destroy him, warning both heroes that the Sandman was destined to murder one third of everyone on Earth. Unwilling to allow the Enclave to commit murder, Spider-Man and Captain America fought to save Marko's life. During the course of the battle, Flint was struck by an evolutionary bolt from the Enclave's [[Kafka (Earth-10737)|Kafka]], causing the very crisis they had come to prevent. Spider-Man convinced the Enclave's [[Tesla (Earth-10737)|Tesla]] to use his powers to overload the Sandman's inhibitor collar causing their foe to revert back to his original state. with the threat over the Enclave returned to their own time and the Sandman was taken back into custody.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #37}} 

====Frightful Four====
[[File:Frightful Four (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Vol 1 36 001.jpg|thumb|right|The original Frightful Four (from left to right): Madame Medusa, the Wizard, Paste-Pot Pete, and the Sandman{{r|Fantastic Four #36}}]]
The genesis of the [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]] began with three villains who commonly battled the Fantastic Four's youngest member the Human Torch. The [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]]), the Sandman and [[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Paste-Pot Pete]] were all defeated at the hands of the Torch.<ref>At that point in time in {{cl|Strange Tales #118}} ([[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]], {{cl|Strange Tales #115}} (Sandman), and {{cl|Strange Tales #124}} ([[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Paste Pot Pete]]).</ref> During his last clash with the Human Torch, the Wizard was sent floating uncontrollably into the upper atmosphere when one of his anti-gravity disks failed to work.{{r|Strange Tales #118}} This coincided with a break out by the Sandman and Paste-Pot Pete who had hijacked a plane to escape. While flying through the air, they spotted the Wizard during his ascent and rescued him suffocation in the upper atmosphere. Realizing that they all had unique powers and a mutual hatred of the Fantastic Four, the Wizard suggested that they form a group that would be the evil counterparts to the Fantastic Four.

Needing a fourth member to their group, the Wizard had heard of a strange woman hiding out on a remote island on the Mediterranean who had complete control of her hair. Travelling there, the Wizard convinced [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Madame Medusa]] to join their ranks. Her past a mystery, Medusa agreed to join them and the Frightful Four was born.{{r|Fantastic Four #36}} In order to keep Medusa under their control, the Wizard implanted a device that kept her lost memories from resurfacing.{{r|X-Men First Class Vol 2 15}} Their formation came just after the Fantastic Four's [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] and [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Girl]] had announced that they were engaged to be married. After an engagement party, the Frightful Four attacked the Fantastic Four's [[Baxter Building]] headquarters. Although they incapacitated the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]], Mister Fantastic, and the Invisible Girl they were too late to stop the Thing's girlfriend [[Alicia Masters (Earth-616)|Alicia Masters]] from sending out a signal flare to the Human Torch who was away from the building at the time. Although the Frightful Four used anti-gravity disks to end the Fantastic Four in the same way the Wizard almost perished, the Torch came to their rescue. Outclassed by the veteran heroes, the Frightful Four decided to retreat in the ensuing battle, setting their anti-gravity craft to self-destruct providing cover for the group to escape.{{r|Fantastic Four #36}} The Frightful Four were later pulled forward in time by [[Aron (Earth-616)|Aron the Rogue Watcher]] to battle the future Fantastic Four and their allies [[Fantastic Force (Earth-616)|Fantastic Force]]. When Aron's plot to destroy the universe to recreate his own reality was stopped, all were returned to their appropriate time and place with no memory of what happened.{{r|Fantastic Four #400}}

Regrouping after their first defeat, the Wizard quickly organized a new plan to destroy their mutual enemies. During this period Paste-Pot Pete reinvented himself with a new name, the Trapster, in an attempt to sound more menacing. They captured the Invisible Girl and kept her prisoner on deserted military outpost in the South Pacific. When the Fantastic Four came to rescue their teammate they fell into the evil FF's trap. While the heroes rescued Sue, the Wizard activated his q-bomb while his team fled the scene. While the Fantastic Four survived thanks to one of the Invisible Girl's invisible force-fields, the radiation from the blast stripped them of their powers.{{r|Fantastic Four #38}} The Frightful Four then returned to the Baxter Building to confirm if the Fantastic Four were dead or not. However they fled the scene when they confused the arrival of the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] warrior [[Balder Odinson (Earth-616)|Balder the Brave]] on Earth to be the Human Torch.<ref>{{cl|Journey into Mystery #116}}: [[Balder Odinson (Earth-616)|Balder]] was called to Earth to defend [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]'s lover [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Jane Foster]] from the [[Amora (Earth-616)|Enchantress]] and [[Skurge (Earth-616)|Executioner]] while Thor was away from Earth participating in the "Trial of the Gods" against [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]].</ref> The Fantastic Four survived the assault, and eventually restored their powers.<ref>The [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] survived the blast as seen in {{cl|Fantastic Four #39}} and restored their powers battling [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Dr. Doom]] in {{cl|Fantastic Four #40}}.</ref>

[[File:Frightful Four (Earth-616) with the Thing from Fantastic Four Vol 1 42.jpg|thumb|left|The Frightful Four and the Thing{{r|Fantastic Four #42}}]]
However, following the restoration of their powers, the Fantastic Four's Thing was angered that he once again lost his humanity and quit the team. Slipping out of town on the back of a truck, the Thing fell asleep as the vehicle crossed over into New Jersey and a bumpy road threw him from the flat bed. The sleeping Thing was discovered by the Frightful Four who quickly kidnapped their sleeping enemy. By this time the Wizard had developed an ID machine and used it to change the Thing's personality so that he was evil. Although the Frightful Four bickered and fought among themselves, the group were able to defeat the remaining members of the Fantastic Four came to rescue their friend, they were easily captured with the aid of the Thing. The Wizard then reminded the Thing that Mister Fantastic was responsible for his transformation, sending the Thing into a frenzy.{{r|Fantastic Four #41}} When the Fantastic Four attempted to break free another fight broke out. While Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Girl managed to escape, the Human Torch was captured and apparently enthralled by the ID machine as well.{{r|Fantastic Four #42}} In reality the ID machine was damaged by the Invisible Girl and the Torch was only pretending to be under the Wizard's thrall, allowing his teammates to capture the Thing and escape. Mister Fantastic then created a device to restore the Thing back to normal. When the Frightful Four finally saw through the Torch's trick and attacked the Baxter Building, the Thing had full recovered and turned the tide of battle. While the male members of the group were apprehended, Medusa managed to escape in their anti-gravity ship.{{r|Fantastic Four #43}} The Sandman was also involved in a new grouping of the Frightful Four that included the [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|Beetle]], although he was defeated by the Fantastic Four again, his activities during this period are unrecorded.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #657}}

====Dirty Sandman====
[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) dirty Sandman from Webspinners Tales of Spider-Man Vol 1 7.jpg|thumb|right|The "dirty" Sandman{{r|Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man #7}}]]
Escaping prison once again the Sandman decided to try and make a name for himself by aligning himself with the Sang Du Mort Brotherhood, attacking the U.N. Building on their behalf. His attack was thwarted by Spider-Man, who irresponsibly tossed a newly made chemical compound on the villain. It initially immobilized the Sandman, but as a side effect it caused dust, dirt, and garbage to be attracted to the Sandman, increasing his mass and affecting his mind.{{r|Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man #7}} Marko broke out of prison once again and went on another rampage to draw Spider-Man out in the hopes the wall-crawler would cure him. Uninterested in doing so, Spider-Man merely incapacitated the Sandman again while they were battling in a warehouse by smothering his foe in fire extinguishing foam.{{r|Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man #8}} The Sandman then continued to wander the streets of New York City, his condition continuing to deteriorate. Spider-Man eventually decided to take responsibility for his actions and cured the Sandman of his condition. In thanks, the Sandman throttled the hero and fled the scene.{{r|Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man #9}}

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Vol 1 61 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Enhanced armor{{r|Fantastic Four #61}}]]
====Upgrade====
Back in prison the Sandman and the Wizard attempted a break out. Although the Fantastic Four interfered with the attempt the Sandman managed to escape. He later attacked the FF at their headquarters, and when he was locked in one of Mister Fantastic's labs he stole a bunch of equipment and then escaped.{{r|Fantastic Four #57}} Utilizing the technical training imparted to him by the Wizard the Sandman used the stolen technology to construct a suit of armor that could infuse his sand form with chemicals and other mixtures to enhance his powers. He then attacked the Fantastic Four again. The group was unprepared for the Sandman's new enhancements. In a ditch effort to defeat their foe, Mister Fantastic opened his portal to the [[Negative Zone]] to try and suck the Sandman in. Marko managed to escape by jumping out a window while Reed was a victim of his own trap.{{r|Fantastic Four #61}} When the Fantastic Four later rescued Reed from the Negative Zone they unknowingly allowed [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar the Living Bomb-burst]] into their dimension. When Blastaar left the Baxter Building bent on conquering the this dimension he crossed paths with the Sandman who convinced the invader that they should pool their resources and defeat the Fantastic Four together.{{r|Fantastic Four #62}} The pair rampaged in the streets of New York, but were opposed by the Fantastic Four and their [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] allies [[Triton (Earth-616)|Triton]] and [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]]. During the course of the battle Sandman attempted to escape by rolling off a pier into New York Harbor, and his sand form dissipated in the water. Blastaar was then defeated by the Fantastic Four who sent him back into the Negative Zone,{{r|Fantastic Four #63}} he later reformed on a beach not far away.{{r|Incredible Hulk #113}} The Sandman quickly rejoined his comrades in the Frightful Four who had since relocated to Europe. The Frightful Four made an attempt to force Medusa to rejoin their ranks upon learning that her lover -- [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]], ruler of the Inhumans -- was incapable of speech without destroying anything in his path. The Wizard at this point had converted his ID machine into a ray gun in the hopes of making it a more practical weapon. The evil FF convinced Medusa that Quadranium-99 could cure Black Bolt. In exchange for the material, Medusa promised to rejoin their ranks. This plan ultimately failed when Medusa figured out that the Wizard was fooling her and that the Quadranium was going to be used to power his new ID ray. Medusa then fled from their ship with the Quadranium and returned it to the United Nations facility in [[France]] where it had been stolen from.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes #15}}

====The Hulk====
[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) glass form from Incredible Hulk Vol 1 114.jpg|thumb|right|Fused into glass{{r|Incredible Hulk #114}}]]
Back on his own again, the Sandman learned that the Air Force was testing out a new space-warp ship and sought to obtain it for himself, hoping to use it to free his ally Blastaar from the Negative Zone. En route to the military base where it was stored, the Sandman crossed paths with the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]. He convinced the Hulk to attack the army base and while [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|General Ross]] and his forces were busy fighting the Hulk, Marko attempted to steal the ship. The Hulk soon turned on the Sandman when the life of [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Betty Ross]] was threatened. During their battle the Hulk clapped his hands causing enough force to send the Sandman's form scattered across the area.{{r|Incredible Hulk #113}} The Sandman was located and approached by the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]] who sought to get revenge against the Hulk for a past defeat. The pair agreed to work together and captured both the Hulk and Betty. When the Hulk saw that Betty was their prisoner he broke free from their trap. In the ensuing battle the Sandman was knocked into pressurized vat while the Mandarin fled. The pressure inside the vat transformed the Sandman into a being made of brittle glass. Since his foe was now incredibly fragile the Hulk allowed him to leave with his life.{{r|Incredible Hulk #114}}

====Cured====
When all the members of the Frightful Four were free from prison they regrouped and began plotting against the Fantastic Four again. The Wizard used his scientific skill to cure the Sandman of his condition.{{R|Incredible Hulk #138}} Rejoining them was Medusa who, unknown to the Wizard and the others, had since recovered her memory and was now an ally of the Fantastic Four. By this point Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Girl had a son, named [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin]], and were seeking a babysitter to care for the boy whenever they were on a mission. When they agreed to visit the witch known as [[Agatha Harkness (Earth-616)|Agatha Harkness]] at her home in [[Whisper Hill]], the Fantastic Four were attacked by their evil counterparts. It was during this battle that Medusa revealed her true allegiances and turned on the Frightful Four. The Frightful Four proved no match for Harkness, who was a powerful mystic, and easily trounced the remaining members of the Frightful Four, securing her job as Franklin's caretaker.<ref>{{cl|Fantastic Four #94}}: [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Girl]] had their son [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin]] in {{cl|Fantastic Four Annual #6}}.

Without Medusa, the Frightful Four once again attempted to recruit a fourth member into their group. At the recommendation of the Sandman they attacked the Baxter Building to access their portal to the [[Negative Zone]] to free his onetime ally [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]]. While the other members of the Fantastic Four were already in the Negative Zone trying to stop [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] from acquiring the [[Cosmic Control Rod]] belonging to Negative Zone leader [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]], the Frightful Four attacked. They easily incapacitated the Invisible Girl and pulled Blastaar from the Negative Zone. They did not anticipate that the young boy named [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] was present and were unprepared when he clashed his [[Nega-Bands]] together summoning his ally [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] to Earth. Despite this surprise attack the Frightful Four succeeded in defeating Captain Marvel.<ref>{{cl|Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Comics Magazine #9}}: The Sandman teamed up with [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]] in {{cl|Fantastic Four #62}}, a union ended when Blastaar was defeated and returned to the Negative Zone in {{cl|Fantastic Four #63}}.</ref> However the addition of Blastaar proved to be short lived as an insult towards the Negative Zone angered Blastaar sufficiently that he attacked his comrades. During the ensuing battle, the rest of the Fantastic Four returned home and defended it from the invaders. While Blastaar was knocked back into the Negative Zone, the rest of the Frightful Four were easily defeated and turned over to the authorities.{{r|Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Comics Magazine #10}}

The Wizard's cure proved only to be temporary and the Sandman found that his body was slowly changing back into glass. Desperate for a permanent solution the Sandman learned that Doctor Marquand had perfected a method of total blood transfusion. Seeking out the doctor the Sandman forced him to perform the treatment on him. As fate would have it, the only patient with the same blood-type as the Sandman was Betty Ross, who was in admittance to the hospital after a mental breakdown. The night that the transfusion was done was also the same evening the Hulk's alter-ego Bruce Banner had managed to track Betty down. Sure enough, moments after the transfusion was complete, the Hulk found the Sandman and the two battled it out. They were both captured by General Ross in a cage specially made for the Hulk. However it could not withstand the strength of both combatants and Ross was forced to dump them in the ocean, lest they get loose in a populated area. The Sandman was defeated by another one of the Hulk's powerful claps, that sent his sand form spread across the ocean. Despite this defeat, the Sandman was ultimately cured of his condition.{{r|Incredible Hulk #138}} Reforming in New York City, Sandman crossed paths with Spider-Man and battled the hero until he realized that it was Christmas Eve and fled the scene. He was pursued to New Jersey by Spider-Man and the Human Torch. However when the heroes realized that he was going to spend the holidays with his mother -- who was apparently no longer aware that he was a criminal -- they decided to leave him alone for the time being.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #1}}

====Thundra====
The Frightful Four reunited once again and attempted to manipulate the Negative Zone once again. To this end they captured Spider-Man and hypnotized him into joining their ranks. They used Spider-Man to infiltrate the Baxter Building when only the Human Torch was home. The Torch was easily subdued allowing the Wizard to gain access to the Negative Zone portal. This plan backfired when Annihilus attempted to use this intrusion to free himself from the Zone and onto Earth. Ultimately the Torch freed Spider-Man from the Frightful Four's control and the pair subdued their foes. Spider-Man then used his scientific know-how to deactivate the Negative Zone portal before leaving the Frightful Four with the Torch to turn over to the authorities.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #2}}

[[File:Frightful Four (Earth-616) Wizard, Thundra, Sandman, Trapster from Fantastic Four Vol 1 130.jpg|thumb|right|The Wizard, Thundra, Sandman, and Trapster{{r|Fantastic Four #130}}]]
The Frightful Four soon obtained their first new recurring member, [[Thundra (Earth-715)|Thundra]], a [[Femazons (Earth-715)|Femazon]] of the alternate future of [[Earth-715]]. The Wizard had promised her the opportunity to battle the most powerful man on Earth in exchange for helping them destroy the Fantastic Four. The quartet attack the Thing at a construction site. Although their attack was interrupted by Medusa, who had come to the Thing's aid, Thundra provided them with the upper hand and both the Thing and Medusa were subdued.{{r|Fantastic Four #129}} Thundra's membership was not without its own troubles as she did not wish to allow the Frightful Four to eliminate the Thing as she viewed men as inferiors. While the evil FF conceded on that point for now, they attacked the Baxter Building, subduing both the Thing and Mister Fantastic. When they discovered the Invisible Girl with her son Franklin, Thundra refused to allow any harm come to the child and fought back against her opponents. Ultimately the Fantastic Four broke free and fought their evil counterparts into retreat once again. In the aftermath of the battle the Invisible Girl left the group over differences with Mister Fantastic, taking their child with her, Medusa then took her place on the team.{{r|Fantastic Four #130}}

However Thundra was not finished with the Thing, seeking to utterly crush him once and for all she challenged him to a one-on-one fight to the finish. In order to force the Thing to agree to the battle, Thundra captured his girlfriend Alicia Masters and left her in the hands of the Frightful Four through the duration of the battle. While the battle took place at Shea Stadium, the Thing was briefly transformed back into human form by Mister Fantastic so that Thundra would forfeit the battle and flee. Meanwhile, the Human Torch rescued Alicia, forcing the Frightful Four to once again flee the scene.{{r|Fantastic Four #133}} The Frightful Four later broke into the Baxter Building waiting to ambush the Fantastic Four after they seemingly lost the Invisible Girl to their sometimes foe the [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]]. Although the Frightful Four had the upper hand, Thundra's continued differences with the group -- particularly their constant sexism toward her -- prompted her to turn on them. Thundra then helped free the Fantastic Four and defeat her former comrades. The Wizard, Trapster and Sandman were then contained at the Baxter Building before the Fantastic Four went on to battle the Sub-Mariner who appeared to be calling for another invasion of the surface world.{{r|Fantastic Four #148}} As it turned out this was merely a mock battle that was staged so that Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Girl could reconcile their marriage after a lengthy separation.{{r|Fantastic Four #149}}

====More Failures====
The Sandman, discarding his enhanced armor, was later hired by the new [[Nicholas Lewis, Jr. (Earth-616)|Crime-Master]] who sought to get revenge against Spider-Man for his involvement in the death of his predecessor. The pair ended up in forcing their way into a similar scheme by the new [[Janice Foswell (Earth-616)|Big Man]] and the Enforcers who sought to get revenge against Spider-Man. When the Big Man captured the Human Torch to lure Spider-Man into a trap, Crime-Master and Sandman appeared to eliminate the wall-crawler themselves.<ref>{{cl|Marvel Team-Up #39}}: [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] clashed with the original [[Nicholas Lewis, Sr. (Earth-616)|Crime-Master]] in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #26}} & {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #27|27}}.

Outnumbered the villains all fled. Sandman, the Enforcers, and Crime-Master later regrouped and attacked the Sons at their headquarters. They were interrupted by Spider-Man who came to their aid. In the ensuing battle the Sandman was knocked out by the Sons of the Tiger. Meanwhile, the Crime-Master fatally shot the Big Man, and realized too late that it was his girlfriend Janice Foswell -- daughter of the original Big Man -- the heroes were shocked to learn that the Crime-Master was the son of the original and through a cruel twist of fate both decided to take up the identities of their parents in an attempt to get revenge from Spider-Man.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #40}} Breaking out of prison again, the Sandman was recruited by the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] who recovered Sandman's enhanced armor. The Sandman was then hired to steal a cryogenic converter and was once again opposed by Spider-Man. During the ensuing brawl, the Sandman became victim of the very device he was hired to steal and was frozen solid and left for the authorities.<ref>{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #154}}: The [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]]'s identity as Sandman's employer was not revealed until {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #163}}.</ref>

[[File:Frightful Four (Earth-616) welcome the Brute into their ranks from Fantastic Four Vol 1 177.jpg|thumb|left|The Brute is welcomed into the ranks of the Frightful Four{{r|Fantastic Four #177}}]]
After escaping captivity again, the three founding members of the Frightful Four reformed, and during an extended absence of their foes put out a classified ad seeking a new fourth member, telling all applicants to meet at the Baxter Building. The Fantastic Four and their ally the [[Impossible Man (Earth-616)|Impossible Man]] soon learned of this and rushed to their headquarters to confront the Frightful Four.{{r|Fantastic Four #176}} While the Impossible Man was distracted by a television, the Fantastic Four were quickly defeated and incapacitated. The Frightful Four then began screening potential members. They rejected the powerless [[Oscar Kincaid, Jr. (Earth-616)|Osprey]], and the heroic [[Drew Daniels (Earth-616)|Texas Twister]] before Thundra came crashing in on them. Thundra warned her former teammates that the Fantastic Four were off limits, but she was quickly subdued and made a prisoner along side her new allies. The Wizard and the others then rejected the pyrophobic [[Griffin Gogol (Earth-616)|Captain Ultra]], before they were attacked by [[Greer Grant (Earth-616)|Tigra]] who briefly freed the Fantastic Four. This escape attempt was then quashed by the most promising recruit to potentially join up with the Frightful Four: the [[Reed Richards (Counter-Earth) (Earth-616)|Brute]], Reed Richard's double on the distant world of [[Counter-Earth (High Evolutionary)|Counter-Earth]]. The Brute helped defeat the Fantastic Four and their allies, securing himself as a member of the group.{{r|Fantastic Four #177}} The Frightful Four then attempted to hold their heroic counterparts hostage for a massive ransom. When the governments of the United States refused to pay the ransom the Wizard decided that it was time to finally kill his hated foes. However, before he could activate his device the broadcast day had ended cutting off the television transmission that kept the Impossible Man preoccupied through out the entire battle. Seeking to boost the signal, the Impossible Man attempted to boost the signal causing a power surge powerful enough to temporarily cut the power in the Baxter Building to allow the Fantastic Four and their allies to break free. The Frightful Four were easily trounced by the good FF, Thundra, and Tigra. The Wizard, Trapster and Sandman were captured once again, while the Brute was seemingly lost in the Negative Zone.<ref>{{cl|Fantastic Four #178}}: In reality the real [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] was caught in the [[Negative Zone]] and his [[Counter-Earth (High Evolutionary)|Counter-Earth]] [[Reed Richards (Counter-Earth) (Earth-616)|double from Counter-Earth]] took his place among the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]. The reason the Counter-Earth Reed was able to fool the Fantastic Four was because their Reed had lost the use of his powers in {{cl|Fantastic Four #177}}. The Fantastic Four eventually learned the truth and rescued their true leader from the Negative Zone in {{cl|Fantastic Four #183}} with the Brute being stranded there in his place.</ref> The Frightful Four later broke out of prison together, although they went their separate ways at that time.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #58}}

With all his past failures filling him with doubt, the Sandman attempted to rob a bank only to be thwarted by the novice heroes [[Frank Moore (Earth-616)|Crime-Buster]] and [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]]. The Sandman was delivered a humiliating defeat when he was locked in the very bank vault he intended to rob, but managed to escape through a drain in the floor. He was confronted by [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi]] war criminal [[Karl von Horstbadden (Earth-616)|Karl von Horstbadden]] who was posing as a psychologist who offered to help the Sandman get over his hang ups. The Sandman agreed and was exposed to a psychological device that made him a slave to Horstbadden's master the terrorist known as the [[Plan Chu (Earth-616)|Yellowclaw]]. The Sandman was then sent to capture [[Wakanda]]n scientist Doctor T'Kora. This kidnapping attempt was interfered with by Nova, but the Sandman's new confidence allowed him to defeat the hero and take him prisoner as well. Nova was placed in a death trap while the Sandman was sent on another mission to kidnap Truman High School student [[Michael Burley (Earth-616)|Mike Burley]], who unknown to all was a classmate of Nova's alter-ego Richard Ryder.<ref>{{cl|Nova #13}}: [[Plan Chu (Earth-616)|Yellow Claw]]'s identity was not revealed until {{cl|Nova #16}}. He sent the Sandman to kidnap [[Michael Burley (Earth-616)|Mike]] because he held his brother, brilliant nuclear research scientist [[Samuel Burley (Earth-616)|Samuel Burley]], in an attempt to force Sam to help with his world domination plot. This plot was foiled in {{cl|Nova #18}}.</ref> The Sandman attacked Mike at Truman High, but was surprised when Mike's classmates [[Donna-Lee Dover (Earth-616)|Donna-Lee Dover]], [[Roger Cooper (Earth-616)|Roger "Caps" Cooper]], and [[Bernie Dillon (Earth-616)|Bernie Dillon]] attempted to stop the kidnapping. Nova eventually broke free and came to Mike's aid, and defeated the Sandman by dumping him in a cement mixer located at a construction site across the street from the school. Immobilized, the Sandman was turned over to the authorities once again.{{r|Nova #14}} Breaking out of prison once again, the Sandman tried to rob yet another bank. This time he was stopped by the Fantastic Four who quickly dispatched him when the Human Torch fused him into glass once again.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #14}}

[[File:Frightful Four (Earth-616) Electro joins the group from Peter Parker the Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 40.jpg|thumb|right|Electro join the group{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #40}}]]
The Frightful Four were quickly incarcerated again, but just as quickly broke free while being processed by the authorities thanks to the Wizard's ingenuity.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #58}} The group then began seeking out yet another member. They selected Spider-Man's longtime foe [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]]. After succeeding in a test run of his powers,{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #39}} they admitted Electro into their group.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #40}} Seeking to get revenge against both Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four, the new Frightful Four went to the Statue of Liberty. Electro then used one of the Wizard's devices that imitated the Human Torch's powers in order to trick Spider-Man into meeting them there. Expecting the Human Torch, Spider-Man was instead ambushed and overpowered by the Frightful Four who easily defeated the wall-crawler.<ref>{{cl|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #42}}: [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] had used the Statue of Liberty as a meeting place since {{cl|Strange Tales Annual #2}}.</ref> The Tapster then disguised himself as Spider-Man in order to infiltrate the Baxter Building where he easily subdued the Human Torch and the Thing before disabling the security systems. The Frightful Four then made an attack on Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Girl, but the real Spider-Man managed to break free and join the fray. With the regrouped Fantastic Four, the evil Frightful Four were easily defeated and once again turned over to the authorities.{{r|Fantastic Four #218}}

The Sandman was late imprisoned at Ryker's Island shortly after it got upgraded by [[Stark Industries]]. When Doctor Octopus staged a break out he freed the Sandman, Electro, and the [[Paul Duval (Earth-616)|Grey Gargoyle]] to help him escape. While Octopus managed to escape, Sandman and the others were defeated by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]].{{r|Marvel Fanfare #22}} He was later broken out by [[Walther Theodoric (Earth-616)|Baron Brimstone]] who wished to employ the Sandman's talents in getting revenge against his foe [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]]. To this end they kidnapped Machine Man's love interest [[Pamela Quinn (Earth-616)|Pamela Quinn]] from the offices of the [[Delmar Insurance Company (Earth-616)|Delmar Insurance Company]]. This attempt was interrupted by both Machine Man and Spider-Man but the two villains succeeded in kidnapping the Quinn woman by teleporting away. However, Spider-Man managed to tag Sandman with a Spider-Tracer which allowed the two heroes to follow their opponents back to Baron Brimstone's estate. Although Baron Brimstone managed to escape, the Sandman was incapacitated by Machine Man and put back into police custody.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #99}}

The Wizard was later broken out of [[Ryker's Island]] prison by the Sub-Mariner's foe [[Llyra Morris (Earth-616)|Llyra]]. Llyra required the Wizard to defeat her old foe and he agreed to assist her provided that she help him destroy his old foe Spider-Man which would have Llyra posing as a new tenant that Peter Parker would find attractive. Tracking the wall-crawler with a special device to his [[410 Chelsea Street|civilian home]] Llyra and the Wizard attempted to trap him by setting the apartment building ablaze.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #213}} Spider-Man managed to save his fellow tenants, foiling the Wizard's plans. Llyra had the Wizard break out his fellow Frightful Four members, Sandman and the Trapster to help in her plot to get revenge against the Sub-Mariner. Llyra's activities got the attention of her prey who came to New York. The Sub-Mariner detected Llyra's presence and attacked the hotel where Peter Parker and his fellow tenants were put up for the night. This led to a battle between Sub-Mariner, Spider-Man and the Frightful Four. The villains then blasted the two heroes with a weapon provided by Llyra. The device succeeded in transferring Spider-Man's spider-sense to the Sub-Mariner. Despite this handicap, the two heroes defeated the Frightful Four. While the Wizard and his cohorts were turned over to the authorities, Namor took Llyra into his possession to answer for her crimes in [[Atlantis]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #214}}

====Scared Straight====
[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) merged with Hydroman into the Mud-Thing from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 218.jpg|thumb|right|Merged with Hydro-Man into the Mud-Thing{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #218}}]]
While on the lamb again, the Sandman stopped into Duffy's Bar where he started romancing a local floozy named [[Sadie Frickett (Earth-616)|Sadie Frickett]]. Sadie was immediately attracted to the Sandman, but the crook found competition from the similarly powered criminal known as [[Morris Bench (Earth-616)|Hydro-Man]]. The two competed for Sadie's affections, fighting in the bar and later stealing expensive items. The two later came to blows in her apartment when their mutual foe Spider-Man came crashing in on them.

Their fight took them to the New York docks where both the Sandman and Hydro-Man were knocked into the river. A combination of the raging storm, and polluted water caused both Hydro-Man and Sandman to merge into a massive creature later dubbed the "Mud-Thing".{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #217}} The nearly brainless creature fought off Spider-Man and crashed into the home of Sadie Frickett. She quickly realized that the creature meant no harm as it had the combined feelings that both Hydro-Man and Sandman felt for her and she managed to convince the authorities to stand down. 

With assistance from the law office of [[Nelson and Murdock (Earth-616)|Nelson and Murdock]], Sadie was able to get the Mud-Thing cleared of any wrong doing committed by its composite parts. She was then approached by showbiz agent Travis Rave who sought to exploit the Mud-Thing for personal gain. Part of this plan involved romancing Sadie in the hopes of manipulating her into following his schemes. On the big night the Mud-Thing was revealed to the public, the creature saw Sadie and Travis kissing and went into a rampage. Spider-Man arrived on the scene to try and quell the beast, but it was only stopped when the authorities doused it with a gas that caused the Mud-Thing to dry out and crumble into dust. The pieces of the Mud-Thing were then gathered up by the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]] to be examined by their scientists.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #218}}

NYPD scientists tried all sorts of chemical and radiation based treatments to try to separate the Sandman and Hydro-Man but they eventually gave up. The remains were then put into a container and dumped in a landfill. However the last radiation treatment had a delayed effect that successfully separated the two villains. Finally free, both the Sandman and Hydro-Man were deeply disturbed and felt violated by their experience and parted ways. The Sandman was deeply troubled and went to a bar to drink his sorrows. His presence was alerted to the Thing of the Fantastic Four. When the Thing realized that the Sandman was not looking for a fight, the pair sat down and had a drink.

After telling the Thing a version of his past, the Sandman expressed a desire to go straight. Not having the heart to bring the Sandman in, the Thing left him alone hoping that the villain would make the best of his second chance.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #86}} Later when the Thing was hospitalized, an army of supervillains attempted to attack him at his weakest moment. These attacks were held off by various superheroes who came to protect their mutual friend.

While the opposing factions were busy fighting outside, the Sandman paid a visit to the Thing, bringing him beer and cigars to pass the time.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #96}} Still haunted by his past as a supervillain, Sandman assumed the alias of Sylvester Mann and eventually managed to get a steady job at a warehouse and rented out an attic room from Roberto and Rosa Cassada and their family in Brooklyn. The Sandman eventually learned that the Kingpin's minion the [[Oswald Silkworth (Earth-616)|Arranger]] had hired the Enforcers to start a protection racket in Brooklyn and was hassling Roberto at his candy shop.

Tracking the Enforcers to their hideout, he found that they had captured his old foe Spider-Man and were giving him a beating. Putting his past differences over the wall-crawler aside, the Sandman came to his rescue and they both defeated the Enforcers. Spider-Man tried to convince the Sandman to turn himself over to the authorities, but Flint refused to do so. Spider-Man then decided to let the Sandman go his own way when the former villain used his body to shield the wall-crawler from a grenade tossed by the Arranger.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #138}} 

The Sandman later reconnected with his former Sinister Six allies Electro and the Vulture for a drink. The trio had a good laugh when novice villains [[Jack Dulouz (Earth-616)|Doctor Sax]] and [[Jonathan Logan (Earth-616)|Johnny Guitar]] tried to drink with them.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #27}} The Sandman and an army of supervillains were later drawn to [[Earth-1219]] by [[Clyde Wyncham Jr. (Earth-1219)|Clyde Wyncham]], a mentally deficient [[Homo superior|mutant]] and that world's only superhuman, and where the daily lives of those native to the Sandman home reality [[Earth-616]] where chronicled in comic books and considered works of fiction. Wyncham was upset that his old comic book collection was being sold after his family home was put up for sale and so he used his vast powers to bring the villains to his reality and attack the towns people.{{r|Marvel 1985 #6}} Likely against his own will, the Sandman was sent to the home of Edgar and Delores Bowman, where he murdered Delores and sent Edgar fleeing from his home only to be killed by Electro.{{r|Marvel 1985 #2}} The Sandman later regrouped at the old Wyncham home with other supervillains who were using it as their home base.{{r|Marvel 1985 #4}} 

Eventually, avid comic book reader [[Toby Goodman (Earth-1219)|Toby Goodman]], managed to get the heroes from the Sandman's native reality to stop the villains in his own and end the crisis there. During the final battle the Sandman was defeated by Spider-Man and taken into custody.{{r|Marvel 1985 #6}} Either escaping or being allowed to resume his new life, the Sandman began working along the docks. There he witnessed Spider-Man battling arms smugglers and remarked over his new [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|costume]], but had to lay low when the authorities arrived. Allowed to continue working later, he spotted Spider-Man when he returned. Unaware that Spider-Man's costume was really a living organism, and that it had taken control of Spider-Man at the time, the Sandman was surprised when the wall-crawler attacked him. Sandman was no match for the shape-changing costume and was easily defeated in battle.{{r|Spider-Man Family Vol 2 1}} Flint soon discovered that the accident that granted him his powers also gave him terminal cancer. He sought an experimental treatment involving radiation at the East Coast Medical Center, he stormed the facility.

When the scientists refused to test out their experiments on a human being, Marko took control of the facility and began exposing himself to various doses of radiation. The Avengers were later called in when the facility's nuclear reactor was about to melt down. They sent their teammate [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] to contain the situation. The Sandman was beat to a stand still and Wonder Man prevented the meltdown from happening. Taken into custody the scientists were surprised to find that the random doses of radiation cured the Sandman of the cancer ravaging his system.<ref>{{cl|Wonder Man #1}}: The notation in this story states these events occur prior to {{cl|West Coast Avengers #1}} and {{cl|Marvel Two-In-One #86}}.

====Silver Sable====
While out for a walk past Coney Island, the Sandman spotted a battle raging between Spider-Man, the international mercenary known as [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]] and the [[Sinister Syndicate (Earth-616)|Sinister Syndicate]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #280}} Despite his misgivings about Spider-Man, Marko helped defeat the Sinister Syndicate who fled the scene. Impressed by the work that the Sandman had done, Silver Sable offered him a job working for her [[Silver Sable International (Earth-616)|organization]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #281}}{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #18}} The Sandman was later hired to accompany Silver Sable in liberating the monarch of [[Belgriun]], who was removed from the throne by a resistance army led by the Sinister Syndicate.

They also gained the assistance of Spider-Man, dispelling his reservations of restoring the brutal monarch by pointing out that he had a young daughter who might have been killed.{{r|Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man #17}} The plan went sideways when Spider-Man managed to get captured, forcing Sandman and Silver Sable to blow their cover. Despite this set back, the trio stopped the Syndicate and prevented their employer, Doctor Octopus, from stealing the royal treasury as well.{{r|Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man #18}}

When it was learned that the communist [[Albert Malik (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] had stolen a nuclear detonator and was hiding out in the nation of Algeria, Silver Sable sent the Sandman to recover it. When he was captured, she sent the heroes [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and [[Alain Racine (Earth-616)|la Peregrine]] to rescue him. The pair stormed the Red Skull's fortress and liberated the Sandman, but were forced to destroy the nuclear device in order to save their own lives.

Despite this setback, they were able to capture the Red Skull and turn him over to the authorities.{{r|Solo Avengers #6}} The Sandman and Silver Sable brought Hawkeye to the Orly International Airport in Paris to see him on his way. Their arrival coincided with an attempted hostage taking by the Bartovian Liberation Front terrorist organization. The trio caught the terrorists off guard and rounded them up for the authorities.{{r|Solo Avengers #7}} Back in the United States, the Sandman was hired by Silver Sable for yet another job,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #302}} this time to hunt down and apprehend a Neo-Nazi named [[Franz Kraus (Earth-616)|Franz Kraus]].

Sable also hired Spider-Man to assist with the job, and the trio tracked Kraus to a warehouse in New York where Kraus was gathering drugs to sell in order to fund their take over a South American island and set up a new Nazi nation. When Spider-Man accidentally blew their element of surprise, Sable and Sandman rushed in and took down Kraus and his army of Neo-Nazis.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #303}} When Silver Sable learned that [[Sunset Bain (Earth-616)|Madame Menace]] and Doctor Octopus were involved in an arms deal, she sent the Sandman to capture Madame Menace. The Sandman called in Hawkeye for an assist although the famed archer was upset by the fact that the Sandman was only seeking to capture Menace. As a result of their differences, the villains were tipped off to their presence and managed to escape capture, although the pair foiled the arms deal.{{r|Solo Avengers #17}}

When Spider-Man was hired by Silver Sable to rob the home of millionaire Winston Walker, it was in order to trick him into revealing the location of the financial records that connected him to the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]]. However when photos of Spider-Man's robbery were published in the Daily Bugle, his sometimes allies the [[Hobie Brown (Earth-616)|Prowler]], the [[Thomas Fireheart (Earth-616)|Puma]], the [[Robert Farrell (Earth-616)|Rocket Racer]] and [[Jackson Arvad (Earth-616)|Will O' the Wisp]] all went looking for Spider-Man to determine if the reports were true. This led them to Ellis Island where the reports appeared to be true. The gathered superhumans attacked Spider-Man and Silver Sable, but the Sandman was present to defend them.

Eventually, Spider-Man stopped his attackers long enough to explain the situation. In the aftermath of the battle, Silver Sable offered the Prowler, Rocket Racer, Will O' the Wisp, and Puma the opportunity to work with her in the future.{{r|Web of Spider-Man #50}} The nation of [[Bosqueverde]] later hired Silver Sable to hunt down former mercenary [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Marc Spector]] for the murder of Ricardo Dominguez, the former president of the country. She hired Sandman and [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]] to work with her [[Wild Pack (Earth-616)|Wild Pack]] soldiers to capture Spector.

Initially Spector fled from them, but eventually surrendered.{{r|Marc Spector: Moon Knight #15}} However Spector eventually cleared his name.{{r|Marc Spector: Moon Knight #18}}

====Sinister Six====
Not long after this, the Wizard and the Trapster reunited and sought to bring the Sandman back into the fold.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #24}} When they found the Sandman they offered him to rejoin them, but the Sandman was making an effort to reform at the time. When he refused the Wizard threatened to inform the authorities of his location, as the Sandman was still wanted at the time, but the Sandman warned the Wizard that the biggest mistake he could make was being in the same prison as him if that happened. The Wizard then conceded, allowing the Sandman to go his own way.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #10}} 

The Sandman was not so lucky when Doctor Octopus sought to reform his Sinister Six. When he approached the Sandman, Octopus threatened to harm the Cassada family if he did not agree to work with him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #334}} Eventually, Doctor Octopus gathered Electro, Mysterio, the Vulture, and the [[Jason Macendale Jr. (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]]. Octavius then explained that he intended to take control of a satellite that was being used by Empire State University to spread a gas across the Earth that would allow them to study ley lines in the hopes of harnessing them for future energy needs. Octavius planned on taking control of the satellite and loading it with a poison which could wipe out the Earth if his demands were not made. Part of this plot involved the use of an experimental submarine, and so Doctor Octopus sent the Sandman and Vulture to recover it.

Although they faced interference from Spider-Man, they succeeded in stealing the sub from a [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]] facility.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #337}} On launch day the Sinister Six attacked the facility in order to enact their plan but were once again opposed by Spider-Man. Having finally had enough, the Sandman turned on the Sinister Six, but he was quickly incapacitated when Doctor Octopus used a device to turn him into glass again.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #338}} Spider-Man eventually defeated the Sinister Six, but was forced to let Doctor Octopus escape in order to recover the device needed to restore the Sandman back to normal. In the aftermath of the battle, Spider-Man convince the arriving authorities that the Sandman was actually assisting him in stopping the villains in order to protect him from being arrested.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #339}}

====Outlaw and Avenger====
The Sandman found himself working with Spider-Man, Prowler, Puma, and the Rocket Racer when the wall-crawler was manipulated by the [[Young Gods (Earth-616)|Young God]] known as [[Jahaharel Patel (Earth-616)|Calculus]] and the [[Space Phantom (Temporal Limbo)|Space Phantom]] into releasing a cannibalistic swarm from the demolition site of an old tenement building owned by the Kingpin. Part of this scheme involved pitting these [[Outlaws (Earth-616)|Outlaws]] against the Avengers to ensure victory. The Space Phantom posed as both Spider-Man and [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] in order to escalate tensions, and later briefly possessed the Sandman when he and Rocket Racer went to the hall of records for information on the tenement.

Although the Space Phantom released his hold on the Sandman, the Outlaws welcomed him back in their ranks as Spider-Man decided it was best to work with the Avengers.<ref>{{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man #169}}, the involvement of [[Jawwaharal Patel (Earth-616)|Calculus]] was not revealed until {{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man #170}}.</ref> When the Outlaws and the Avengers met at the ruins of [[Avengers Mansion]] the Space Phantom manipulated another battle, but his presence was ferried out by the Puma. The two teams then worked together to uncover the mystery of the killer swarm and destroy it.

The Sandman later parted on good terms with the gathered superheroes.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #170}} Sandman was later hired along with the Prowler, Rocket Racer and Paladin to join Silver Sable on a mission to recover a stolen nuclear simulator that was stolen by Professor Walshe of the Darkmoor Research Center in England. This led to a clash with England's mutant team known as [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]].

Walshe was later revealed to be a construct of Nazi geneticist [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]]. When Sable and her allies incapacitated the Zola construct they accidentally released his irradiated clones and their guardian, a creature known as the [[Sheppard (Earth-616)|Sheppard]]. The two teams pooled their resources to destroy the creatures. With the threat over, Sable was allowed to recover the stolen technology.{{r|Excalibur #36}}

When the Avengers reformed under a new [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] charter, chairperson Captain America formed a new team which included [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], the [[Eternals|Eternal]] [[Sersi (Earth-616)|Sersi]], [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]], She-Hulk, the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], and [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]]. He also elected a reserve team which included Spider-Man, the [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]], [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]], [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], and [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]].

He also surprised the gathered press by also selecting the Sandman and novice hero [[Elvin Haliday (Earth-616)|Rage]] as probationary Avengers. The announcement was soured when the deities known as the [[Tetrarchs of Entropy (Earth-616)|Tetrarchs of Entropy]] appeared and absconded with the primary team to another dimension, leaving the reserves and Sandman and Rage behind.{{r|Avengers #329}} While the reserve members dealt with the crisis at hand, Sandman and Rage got to know each other and complete their background checks with the Avengers.{{r|Avengers #330}} Ultimately the primary team managed to free themselves and return to their home dimension.{{r|Avengers #331}} Sandman and Rage then underwent rigorous training under Captain America.{{r|Captain America #385}} When the new [[Avengers Compound]] was officially opened, the Avengers threw a party for UN officials and members of the superhero community.

However the festivities were marred when [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Dr. Doom]] infiltrated the facility with his [[Doombots]]. Sandman, the Vision, and Captain America battled two of the Doombots in the sub-sub-basement of the facility, while supposedly the true Dr. Doom revealed himself to the party attendees on the main floor.{{r|Avengers #332}} Doom threatened to destroy Avengers Compound if the team refused to use their dimensional traveling abilities to help him rescue his mother from another dimension. However his plan fell apart when Sandman, Vision and Cap destroyed the Doombots in the basement. Then the rest of the team discovered the "Doom" in their presence was also a Doombot as well and disabled him, foiling Doom's plot.{{r|Avengers #333}}

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 348 001.jpg|thumb|left|The Sandman calling his fellow Avengers{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #348}}]]
Flint and the rest of the Avengers got involved in the so-called [[Subterranean Wars]] when [[Moloids]] and [[Lava Men]] fled to the surface world. Traveling below the Earth they learned that the [[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Mole Man]], [[Romulus Augustulus (Earth-616)|Tyrannus]] and [[Gor-Tok (Earth-616)|Grotesk]] were warring with the [[Deviants|Deviant]] known as [[Brutus (Deviant) (Earth-616)|Brutus]] and his [[Deviant Mutates (Monstrous Deviants)|Mutates]] for dominion of [[Subterranea]].

Seeing the trio as the lesser of two evils the Avengers agreed to fight. The Sandman was among the Avengers who were captured during the initial strike against Brutus and his forces.{{r|Avengers Annual #20}} They were later liberated by the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]] and they defeated Brutus and his forces. When Grotesk attempted to slaughter everyone on the surface with an oscillatron created by Brutus, the combined Avengers teams stopped him as well.{{r|Avengers: West Coast Annual #6}} The fame that being a reserve Avengers brought soon paid its toll on the quiet life the Sandman had tried to create himself. The press swarmed the home he rented from the Casada family, prompting Rosa to ask him to leave. 

Seeking to do some good, the Sandman discovered that some terrorists were attempting to hijack a shipment of radioactive material going through the Brooklyn Trainyards. Sandman then called in his fellow Avengers and stopped the attempted theft. In the aftermath, Captain America cautioned the Sandman for using Avengers resources for civil conflicts, as the organization was now under the purview of the United Nations. Misinterpreting this advice as though he was being fired, the Sandman stormed away before Captain America could explain things further.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #348}}

====Canadian Politics====
Believing that going straight had failed him, the Sandman then took up a job working for a political zealot in Canada named Boussard. Boussard had kidnapped the daughter of his political opponent Eduard LeBon in order to force him to resign his position in the Canadian Parliament. Unknown to Boussard, Flint intended to turn on him in order to prove he was a hero.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #11}} Silver Sable International was hired to rescue LeBons' daughter and Silver Sable recruited Rocket Racer, the Prowler and Will O' the Wisp to help her on the mission, warning them that the Sandman was working with Boussard.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #25}} Sure enough when they arrived at Boussard's stronghold in central Quebec, the Sandman appeared to be defending the political zealot.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #11}} 

When it became clear that Boussard intended on killing LeBons' daughter anyway, the Sandman dropped his cover and rescued the girl. Impressed with his work, Silver Sable gave him a full contract to work with her in the future.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Annual #7}}

====Sinister Six vs.====
Fearing that Doctor Octopus might strike at him through the Casada family, the Sandman began watching over them. One day his worst fears came true and a bomb went off at their house. Blaming Doctor Octopus, the Sandman sought out the other members of the Sinister Six who were looking to get revenge against Octopus for betraying them previously.

In order to make sure that things did not get out of hand, the Sandman contacted Spider-Man to watch over the situation.{{r|Spider-Man #18}} However the confrontation between the Sinister Six and Doctor Octopus exploded in violence that was complicated by the arrival of the Hulk. During the course of the battle Sandman realized that it was the Sinister Six who planted the bomb, framing Octopus, in order to secure the Sandman to their cause. When Sandman fought back, Doctor Octopus transformed him into glass again. After defeating both Spider-Man and the Hulk, Doctor Octopus convinced the rest of the Sinister Six to join him on his current attempt at world domination and they fled the scene with the inert Sandman as their prisoner.{{r|Spider-Man #19}} 

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) broken glass form from Spider-Man Vol 1 23.jpg|thumb|right|Broken glass form{{r|Spider-Man #23}}]]
Sandman was stored at Doctor Octopus' hideout in New Jersey. After arming themselves with advanced weapons, Doctor Octopus shattered the Sandman's glass body and then led his minions on an attack of a [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] facility.{{r|Spider-Man #22}} Flint managed to reform his body out of the broken shards of glass and followed the Sinister Six to the Hydra hideout. when he arrived he witnessed as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Nova, the mercenary known as [[James Bourne (Earth-616)|Solo]], the cyborg [[Michael Collins (Earth-616)|Deathlok]], the [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] and the Hulk battled it out with the Sinister Six. Consumed with rage, Sandman attacked Doctor Octopus, seriously wounding him with shards of glass. Flint was stopped form killing Octavius by Spider-Man who told him that he needed to do better if he wished to be a hero. With the villains defeated, Spider-Man used Doctor Octopus' weapon to restore the Sandman back to his normal form.

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) with Silver Sable and the Wild Pack from Silver Sable Vol 1 2.jpg|thumb|left|Sandman with Silver Sable and the Wild Pack{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #2}}]]
====Wild Pack====
When Silver Sable began forming an elite team within her Wild Pack, consisting of mercenaries with checkered pasts that were seeking a second chance, she and Sandman trained new recruits. During one training session she selected former [[Ku Klux Klan (Earth-616)|KKK]] bodyguard [[Doug Powell (Earth-616)|Doug Powell]]. When Silver Sable went to deal with a Hydra hostage taking at Cranewood School for Girls in Long Island, Sandman and Powell disobeyed orders to give her back up. En route, Powell made a bet with Sandman that he could romance Silver Sable, putting a thousand dollars on the line. Sandman instigated the bet due to his growing feelings for Sable. With the help of the pair and Spider-Man, Silver Sable was able to save her cousin Ana from [[Dmitri Petrovich (Earth-616)|Dmitri Petrovich]] the leader of the operation. Sable was not impressed with the interference and threatened to dock them pay for disobeying her orders.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #1}} The ranks of the Wild Pack were increased, with former Hydra agent and sadist known as the [[Carlton Stricklan (Earth-616)|Crippler]], female assassin [[Amelia Chen (Earth-616)|Amy Chen]], and [[Raul Quentino (Earth-616)|Quentino]] a former LA gang member and recovering drug addict.

The Wild Pack were later hired by crooked televangelist [[Donald Smithfield (Earth-616)|Reverend Donald Smithfield]] to protect him from assassins seeking to kill him. Sandman posted as Smithfield foiling an assassination by the mercenary known as [[Gattling (Earth-616)|Gattling]] and the [[Watchdogs (Earth-616)|Watchdogs]], however they failed to capture Gattling.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #2}} The Wild Pack were soon joined by the super-strong [[Lemar Hoskins (Earth-616)|Battle Star]], and eventually they uncovered that the man who hired Gattling to assassinate Smithfield was his rival, [[George Chesterford (Earth-616)|George Chesterford]], who sought to control the supply of drugs in the region that Smithfield controlled. While the Wild Pack took down Gattling, Chesterford was murdered by Silver Sable's ex-husband the [[Foreigner (Earth-616)|Foreigner]].{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #3}}

[[File:Sandman (Impostor) (Earth-616) and William Baker (Earth-616) from Silver Sable and the Wild Pack Vol 1 4 002.jpg|thumb|right|Sandman doppelganger{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #4}}]]
While Silver Sable was away on a dinner with her ally Doctor Doom, Sandman and the Wild Pack learned of the so-called [[Infinity War]] which saw Earth's heroes fighting evil doppelgangers of themselves. When Sable failed to report in, the group decided to mobilize to see if she was all right. Left alone, Sandman was attacked and his body possessed by his own [[Sandman (Impostor) (Earth-616)|doppelganger]].{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #4}} When they arrived in [[Latveria]], they quickly learned that Sable was fighting for her life against a [[Doctor Doom (Impostor) (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom impostor]]. When the possessed Sandman attacked, the Wild Pack knocked him out and later saved Sable. While knocked out, the doppelganger and Sandman separated and the impostor apparently died.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #5}} 

As this was happening the [[Magus (Earth-7528)|Magus]] managed to get control of the [[Infinity Gauntlet (Item)|Infinity Gauntlet]] and used it's power to render everyone one Earth inert, including Sandman and his allies.{{r|Infinity War #5}} When Earth's heroes ultimately defeated the Magus, everyone on Earth was freed from his thrall.{{r|Infinity War #6}} The Sandman then took a vacation from the Wild Pack{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #6}} and agreed to meet with mercenary [[James Burley (Earth-616)|Agent X]] who offered the Sandman a job working for his own outfit the [[Next Wave (Earth-616)|Next Wave]], offering to pay him more money than Silver Sable International. His loyalties with Silver Sable wavering the Sandman told Agent X that he would consider their offer.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #7}}

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) Next Wave costume from Silver Sable Vol 1 12.jpg|thumb|left|Next Wave costume{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #12}}]]
Sandman rejoined Silver Sable and the Wild Pack on a mission with Paladin to South America to hunt down a rogue faction of Hydra called the [[Genesis Coalition (Earth-616)|Genesis Coalition]], which consisted of escaped Nazi scientists [[Franz Lubischt (Earth-616)|Franz Lubischt]], [[Ivan Trevkov (Earth-616)|Ivan Trevkov]] as well as Sable's old foe Dmitri Petrovich. They discovered that the scientists were converting the natives into animal hybrids and smashed the operation although the Genesis Coalition members escaped. One of the transformed captives they rescued, later dubbed [[Malcolm Murphy (Earth-616)|Man-Killer]] joined Sable's ranks.

During this battle, the Sandman began to doubt his contributions to the team, thinking he was only there to take orders from Sable.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #8}} Later, Sandman came to Silver Sable and informed her that he was quitting her organization.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #9}} Sandman joined Agent X and his operatives in the Next Wave and they were quickly hired by [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]]'s Hydra to steal a vessel stolen by the Genesis Coalition. They arrived at the same time as Silver Sable and the Wild Pack who were on a mission to destroy the Genesis Coalition's [[Cyberwarriors (Earth-616)|Cyberwarriors]], making it an awkward situation for Sandman and his former allies.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #11}} Because of the Next Wave's interference, the Genesis Coalition and their Cyberwarriors managed to launch their attack on the nation of [[Transia]] and [[Wundagore Mountain]]. The Wild Pack, Next Wave and rogue Cyberwarrior [[John Kelly (Earth-616)|Siege]] helped the [[Knights of Wundagore (Earth-616)|Knights of Wundagore]] defend their land. Realizing that the Next Wave were sloppy and unstable, Sandman sheepishly asked to rejoin the Wild Pack and was welcomed back into their ranks. The mysterious [[Fin (Intruders) (Earth-616)|Fin]] also left the Next Wave and joined up with Sables crew.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #12}}

When the Sandman learned that the Human Torch was being put on trial for accidentally setting [[Empire State University]] on fire, the Sandman went to watch the trial as a sign of solidarity to his friend the Thing. Silver Sable accompanied him, and the two were present when the [[Fearsome Four (Earth-616)|Fearsome Four]] attacked the court house.<ref>{{cl|Fantastic Four #377}}: The [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] accidentally set fire to [[Empire State University]] in {{cl|Fantastic Four #372}}.</ref> Sandman joined Spider-Man, [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], the Fantastic Four and the Avengers in defending the Torch from the Foursome, who fled the scene.{{r|Fantastic Four #378}} Sandman later returned to active duty with the Wild Pack, preventing the [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]] from committing acts of anarchy across the United States.

Sandman led the Fin, Man-Eater, and Paladin to search for the Viper in Kentucky, but found only one of her [[Pit-Vipers (Earth-616)|Pit-Viper]] impostors there. Eventually, Silver Sable and the rest of the Wild Pack -- with some assistance from Captain America -- managed to capture the real Viper.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #15}} During the [[Infinity Crusade]] crisis, the [[Goddess (Earth-616)|Goddess]] caused a shift in personality of those on Earth, making them more benevolent in order for them to accept her rule.<ref>See [[Infinity Crusade]].</ref> Around this time, Silver Sable had formed a sub-group within the Wild Pack, the Intruders, which consisted of Sandman, Paladin, Fin, and Man-Eater.

Slightly under the influence of the Goddess Sandman and his Wild Pack comrades went to deliver food supplies to an impoverished region of Somalia. Their activities were opposed by the local mutant group known as the [[Bio-Genes (Earth-616)|Bio-Genes]] as well as Strucker's Hydra.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #16}} The Bio-Genes later decided to help the Wild Pack and Intruders fight off Strucker and his forces, a feat they accomplished with the assistance of [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] and his spy agency [[Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-Enforcement Division (Earth-616)|SHIELD]].{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #17}} Eventually the heroes of Earth defeated the Goddess and the natural order was restored.{{r|Infinity Crusade #6}}

Sandman then joined the Wild Pack on a mission to San Francisco to capture the vigilante known as [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]], who had previously eluded the Wild Pack on a prior mission. This time with the power of Sandman, they were more of a match for Venom, but the battle took a turn when San Francisco was enveloped in a mystical black fog.<ref>{{cl|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #18}}: the [[Wild Pack (Earth-616)|Wild Pack]] previously battled and failed to capture [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]] in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #375}}. The cloud that enveloped San Francisco was the work of the demon [[Lilith (Earth-616)|Lilith]] during the [[Siege of Darkness]] event.</ref> Sandman and the Wild Pack were then swarmed by an army of Lilith's [[Lilin]], and grudgingly accepted Venom's help in defending themselves. In exchange for assisting them to safety, Silver Sable agreed to allow Venom to go free. 

Eventually the demonic crisis dissipated.<ref>{{cl|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #19}}: The cloud of darkness was dispelled by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] in {{cl|Midnight Sons Unlimited #4}}.</ref> Later when the Daily Bugle reported that Empire State University was experimenting on matter collected from his body and that of the similarly powered [[Quicksand (Nguyet) (Earth-616)|Quicksand]], the Sandman went to investigate.

He crossed paths with Spider-Man just as the lab doing the experiment exploded causing research student [[Tony Trainer (Earth-616)|Tony Trainer]] to mutate into Sandstorm.{{r|Web of Spider-Man #107}} Sandstorm went on a rampage, goaded on by Quicksand, but Spider-Man and Sandman tried to calm him down. Ultimately the two heroes managed to reverse the process changing Sandstorm back to normal while Quicksand escaped. Sandman then accompanied Tony into custody to ensure that he was treated fairly by the authorities.{{r|Web of Spider-Man #108}}

Sandman and the Intruders joined the Wild Pack in quelling gang violence that had exploded in Beverly Hills led by [[Latisha Arnold (Earth-616)|Latisha Arnold]]. When Arnold's gang could not fight off the Wild Pack, her employer [[Justin Hammer (Earth-616)|Justin Hammer]] sent in his costumed operatives the Beetle, [[Donald Gill (Earth-616)|Blizzard]], [[Marco Scarlotti (Earth-616)|Blacklash]], [[Nathan Lemon (Earth-616)|Spymaster]], [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]], [[Gregory Stevens (Earth-616)|Cyclone]], and [[Afterburner (Earth-616)|Afterburner]] to deal with the mercenaries.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #21}} Sandman and his allies managed to stop the villains and quell the gang violence, but not before Quentino was seriously wounded. At Quentino's behest his friend and former gang member [[Larry Arnold (Earth-616)|Larry Arnold]] was accepted into the ranks of the Wild Pack.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #22}}

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) Wild Pack costume from Silver Sable Vol 1 26.jpg|thumb|right|Wild Pack costume{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #26}}]]
Once again filled with self doubt and questioning his worth, the Sandman went out for a walk when he came across an apartment fire. When he disobeyed a police officer to enter the building and save the lives of people and firemen trapped inside, he was hailed as a hero, convincing William that he had worth after all.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #23}} With the addition of [[Obax Majid (Earth-616)|Lightbright]] to their team, the Sandman led the Intruders to provide the Wild Pack back up in Bosnia. There Sandman aided his comrades in preventing the Genesis Coalition in framing Hydra for trying to invade the country, stopping both terrorist organizations.<ref>{{cl|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #25}}: The narrative of this story states that these events occurred during the [[Wikipedia:Bosnian War|Bosnian War]] which occurred form 1992 to 1995. Per the [[Glossary:Sliding Timescale|Sliding Timescale]] of [[Earth-616]] this should be considered a topical reference relative to the date of publication. 

This story should be generalized as taking place during a conflict in Bosnia, but not specifically the war that took place there between 1992 to 1995.</ref> The Sandman later reconnected with his old Frightful Four ally the Trapster, who claimed to be going straight. The Sandman invited him to stay at the Symkarian Embassy and petitioned Silver Sable to allow him to join the Wild Pack. However the Sandman soon discovered that the Trapster was merely using him to rebuild his equipment to commit a series of robberies to pay off his gambling debts. Deeply upset and hurt by this, the Sandman took down his former ally and turned him over to the authorities.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #26}} Later when Man-Eater's animalistic side took over, the Sandman joined the Wild Pack and NYPD's [[Code: Blue (Earth-616)|Code: Blue]] in subduing him and taking him for treatment.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #27}}

When Amy Chen's former assassin allies tried to pull her back into the fold, she sought to take them down her own way. She enlisted the Sandman's aid to pose as Maggia mobster Joey Capo, whom Chen "killed" in order to win the loyalty of her assassins. Later Amy took down the assassins with the aid of Silver Sable.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #28}} Sandman later joined Silver Sable and the Wild Pack in preventing a group of men from looting ancient Aztec temples in Mexico on behalf of the American government. The mission took a turn for the strange when the Wild Pack were seemingly transported back in time to the age of the Mayans and forced to fight to the death. Sandman came to their aid by posing as the [[Ahau]] death god, [[Ah Puch (Ahau) (Earth-616)|Ah Puch]], scaring away the Mayans.

Escaping back through the temple which they came, the Wild Pack were transported back to their own time. Upon their return to the United States, the Wild Pack were shocked when Silver Sable was arrested for murder.<ref>{{cl|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #29}}: [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]] was framed by her former lover [[Jacques Girard (Earth-616)|Jacques Girard]] as part of a plea bargain to get out of his own legal troubles caused by the [[Foreigner (Earth-616)|Foreigner]]. These events unfolded throughout the entire [[Silver Sable and the Wild Pack Vol 1|Silver Sable]] series.</ref> Sandman and the other members of the Wild Pack were ordered to wait out until Silver Sable's name was clear. Sandman took an active role trying to convince their former clients and backers to come to Sable's defense only to find they had all been stonewalled by the United States government. However Sable was soon released when her exposure of an attempt to frame her for an escape attempt forced the [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|CIA]] to release her, however it was conditional on her leaving the United States.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #30}}

When Sable later went on a mission to stop the mobster [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]] from blowing up a foreign made bullet train in Japan, the Sandman became concerned about her suspicious behavior. He had the recovered Quintero hack into Silver Sable International's database and Sandman was shocked to learn that Sable was apparently pregnant.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #31}} Heart broken, but concerned for his employers safety, Sandman launched a rescue mission. He helped Sable retake the train, however the bombs on it were still prepped to go off.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #32}} Sandman helped Sable disarm the bombs, but Hammerhead managed to escape. In the aftermath of the battle the Sandman revealed how much he felt for Silver, and that he would be willing to help raise her child regardless of who the father was. The two shared a brief kiss but their romance was not meant to be, as Sable's doctor revealed that the pregnancy test was flawed and that she was not actually pregnant. 

With the prospect of being a mother quashed and her struggles with killing her foes, Silver Sable then backed away from combat missions telling her employees that she was taking on a purely administrative role. It appeared that all romantic possibilities between William and Sable were quashed.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #33}} Later, Silver Sable had Sandman take the Intruders on a secret mission, the details of which are unrevealed.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #34}} However, Silver Sable eventually returned to active duty within her organization.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #35}}

Later when Doctor Octopus was murdered, the Sandman attended his funeral held for his former ally.<ref>{{cl|Spider-Man: Funeral for an Octopus #1}}: [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] was murdered by the [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] clone known as [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]] in {{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man #221}}.

They intercepted Spider-Man as he was going to meet the Human Torch at the Statue of Liberty and a battle broke out. 

In the end, both Sable and Sandman were convinced that it was a new Spider-Man, but were impressed by his abilities.<ref>{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #407}}: [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]] turned over the role of Spider-Man over to his clone [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Ben Reilly]] in {{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man #229}}/{{cl|Sensational Spider-Man #0}}, per {{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man #226}} they were tricked into thinking that Peter Parker was a clone and Ben Reilly was the original Spider-Man. Ultimately it was revealed in {{cl|Spider-Man #75}} that Peter Parker was the true Spider-Man all along and Ben Reilly was a clone and that the confusion was all part of a grander scheme of revenge against Spider-Man by his arch-nemesis the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]]. See the [[Clone Saga]] for more details.</ref>

However the original Spider-Man soon returned to the job, and the Sandman flew out to Greece after Spider-Man was stuck there following an adventure with Hercules. As payment for a flight back to New York City, Spider-Man was forced to accompany the Sandman from stopping the terrorist organization known as [[Underground Liberated Totally Integrated Mobile Army To Unite Mankind (Earth-616)|ULTIMATUM]] from attacking Buckingham Palace and killing the Royal Family in an attempt to disrupt financial negotiations among members of the European Union. The pair got unlikely assistance from ULTIMATUM's leader [[Karl Morgenthau (Earth-616)|Flag-Smasher]] whose members went rogue. When the ULTIMATUM rogues were captured, the Sandman stopped a bomb set by Flag-Smasher to blow up Buckingham Palace.<ref>{{cl|Marvel Team-Up Vol 2 3}}: [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] resumed the role of Spider-Man following the death of [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Ben Reilly]] in {{cl|Spider-Man #75}}. 

He was in Greece on a mission for the [[Tito Mendez (Earth-616)|Authority]]. The narrative of the story states that [[Underground Liberated Totally Integrated Mobile Army To Unite Mankind (Earth-616)|ULTIMATUM]] was against the formation of the [[Wikipedia:European Union|European Union]] and the implementation of the [[Wikipedia:Euro|Euro]] as a unified currency between counties in Europe. As this story was published in 1997 as the Euro was still being established as a currency, it should be considered a topical reference per the [[Glossary:Sliding Timescale|Sliding Timescale]] of [[Earth-616]]. As such any reference to these historical events should be generalized.</ref> After returning Spider-Man to New York, the Sandman gave him information on the [[Tito Mendez (Earth-616)|Authority]], the man who had sent Spider-Man on a series of missions across the globe.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 2 4}} Silver Sable sent Sandman to confirm the identity of Spider-Man after he was framed of murder and kidnapping. 

When their mutual foe Hydro-Man took hostages in order to draw Spider-Man out of hiding and collect the 5 million dollar bounty on his head, Sandman arrived on the scene. While Spider-Man rescued the hostages, Sandman forced a merger with Hydro-Man, and while the pair were disorientated Silver Sable froze them in liquid nitrogen and had them carted off so Hydro-Man could be separated and incarcerated. Eventually, Spider-Man cleared his name.<ref>{{cl|Sensational Spider-Man #26}}: [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] was framed for murdering mobster Joey Z in {{cl|Spider-Man #86}} by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] who hired the [[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Trapster]] to do the dirty deed. Later Osborn put a bounty on Spider-Man's head, accusing him of trying to kidnap his grandson [[Norman Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Normie Osborn]] in {{cl|Sensational Spider-Man #25}}. Spider-Man eventually cleared his name in {{cl|Spider-Man #92}}.</ref>

Returning to Symkaria, Sandman joined a new incarnation of the Wild Pack which included the [[Shen Kuei (Earth-616)|Cat]], Paladin, and [[Madcap (Earth-616)|Madcap]] -- who was disguising himself as [[Jack Monroe (Earth-616)|Nomad]] at the time. Silver Sable and the Wild Pack were hired to protect Professor Wolfgang Hessler who was constructing bio-weapons to sell to the highest bidder. Silver Sable's fortress was later attacked by the [[Heroes for Hire (Oracle Inc.) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]] who sought to capture Hessler before he could complete his work, leading to a clash between the two groups.{{r|Heroes for Hire #10}} Sandman squared off against [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Power Man]] and ultimately the Wild Pack defeated the Heroes for Hire. With the attackers contained, Silver Sable allowed the Sandman to leave to the United States for Avengers business.{{r|Heroes for Hire #11}}

[[File:William Baker (Earth-398) from Avengers Vol 3 2 0001.jpg|thumb|left|As the Quarryman{{r|Avengers Vol 3 2}}]]
Sandman was drawn back to the Avengers when various former members were attacked by [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] creatures. Sandman was among those gathered and sent to investigate. But they were too late to prevent the 6th century sorceress [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]] from using the [[Norn Stones]], [[Twilight Sword (Surtur)|Twilight Sword]] and the hex powers of the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] to alter reality to her whims.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 1}} This reality warp caused Sandman's native [[Earth-616]] to be replaced with [[Earth-398]] where he was forced to live the life of his Earth-398 counterpart, the [[William Baker (Earth-398)|Quarryman]] who was a member of Morgan le Fay's [[Queen’s Vengeance (Earth-398)|Queen's Vengeance]]. 

Unchanged by the spell, the Scarlet Witch began reaching out with her powers from the dungeon she was contained. While other Avengers began to remember their original identities, the Sandman was one of those who remained under Morgan's control.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 2}} Eventually, Morgan le Fay was defeated thanks to the recently resurrected [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]], and with le Fay's defeat, reality was restored to normal.<ref>{{cl|Avengers Vol 3 3}}: [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] was slain in {{cl|Force Works #1}} but was resurrected by the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] in {{cl|Avengers Vol 3 2}}.</ref> With the crisis over, the Sandman returned to working for Silver Sable Incorporated.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 4}}

===Return to Evil===
====Personality Crisis====
One day while leaving the Symkarian Embassy, the Sandman was knocked out by his old ally the Wizard. By this time the Wizard had built a new version of his ID machine and used it to try and bring back his evil persona. The Sandman broke free, and fought off the Wizard, warning him to stay away from him in the future. However the device had the desired effect, as the Sandman began referring to himself as Flint Marko once again.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 12}} The Sandman later began working with his old allies the Wizard and the Trapster. Using his connections with the Symkarian Embassy, the Sandman arranged an unauthorized job to work as a body guard for US Senator [[Stewart Ward (Earth-616)|Stewart Ward]]. This was all part of a scheme to assassinate Ward. The Trapster blew Sandman's cover by attacking outright and the battle drew out Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four. Out numbered and his cover ruined, the Sandman and Trapster fled the scene, unaware the whole point of their mission was to make the public sympathetic to Senator Ward.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 4}} The Sandman then sought out [[Daniel Berkhart (Earth-616)|Mysterio]], [[Alexei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]], Electro, and the Vulture to form the Sinister Six once again. The group once more tried to get revenge against the recently resurrected Doctor Octopus, who was also protecting Senator Ward. Their attack was interrupted by both Spider-Man and yet another of his foes, Venom.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 12}} Sandman allowed Venom to join the Sinister Six, promising to allow him revenge against Spider-Man once they completed their primary objective. When they finally had Ward and Octopus cornered, Senator Ward surprised everyone when suddenly he unleashed an energy blast sending the Sinister Six fleeing.<ref>{{cl|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 12}}: [[Stewart Ward (Earth-616)|Stewart Ward]] was a former paramilitary who was infected with a [[Z'nox (Race)|Z'nox]] virus, giving him the powers displayed here. As revealed in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 23}}.</ref> The Sandman later battled Spider-Man at a construction site. This conflict was witnessed by the two young mutants named [[Arthur Maddicks (Earth-616)|Artie]] and [[Leech (Earth-616)|Leech]]. The pair distracted Sandman long enough for Spider-Man to knock him out.{{r|Generation X #59}} Later, the Sandman was approached by [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|Mach-2]] of the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] who was seeking his past knowledge in Symkaria to infiltrate the country so that they could find the mysterious [[V-Battalion (Earth-616)|V-Battalion]] and rescue their teammates and ally [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Atlas]] and [[Dallas Riordan (Earth-616)|Dallas Riordan]]. The Sandman accompanied the Thunderbolts to Symkaria, and helped them locate the V-Battalion's cloaked helicarrier the Vanguard.{{r|Thunderbolts #40}} During the battle between the Thunderbolts and the V-Battalion, the Sandman slipped away to Silver Sable's castle. There he attacked the Wild Pack until a united Thunderbolts/V-Battalion team came to stop him. The two teams succeeded in incapacitating the Sandman by fusing him into glass once again.{{r|Thunderbolts #41}}

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) disintigrating form from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 17.jpg|thumb|right|Disintegrating form{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 17}}]]
Sandman later broke into the Davis Gallery to steal an alien artifact. He was caught in the act by his former employer Silver Sable and her Wild Pack. Silver gave her former employee the chance to walk away, but the Sandman refused to give up his prize. Although the Sandman learned how to use his powers in new, more deadly ways, he was outnumbered by the Wild Pack and was forced to flee the scene.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #2000}} Shortly there after Venom began stalking the other members of the Sinister Six to get revenge for denying him the right to destroy Spider-Man. Pursued by Venom, the Sandman hid out at the Daily Bugle in the hopes that their battle would draw Spider-Man's attention. Sure enough when Spider-Man did show up the three battled it out. During the course of the fight, Venom ate a chunk of the Sandman's body. Unable to maintain a cohesive form, the Sandman fled the scene.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 16}} With his body slowly falling apart, the Sandman blamed Mysterio for his current condition and went on a rampage across New York to try and find him. This was also met with interference from Spider-Man. Although Sandman managed to find Mysterio, the illusionist also had Electro with him and a fight broke out. When Spider-Man caused the warehouse they were battling in to collapse, the Sandman fled outside where Spider-Man left him to be rounded up by the authorities.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 17}} Escaping the authorities, Sandman's condition worsened. Flint tried to consume other sources of sand, but his body rejected it. Coming apart at the seams and believing that he was about to die, Marko wrote a goodbye letter to his mother before attacking Spider-Man for what he thought would be the last time. The battle lasted too long and Sandman lost all control over his body and crumbled into the street where he was washed down a storm drain.<ref>{{cl|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 22}}: This battle was observed by the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]] as recounted in {{cl|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 26}}.</ref> 

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) from Peter Parker Spider-Man Vol 1 43 001.jpg|thumb|left|The "sandilicious" Sandman{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 43}}]]
However this was not the end of the Sandman as he was washed ashore of Jones Beach. When Sonic TV threw a massive beach party on the beach, The Sandman began absorbing the spoiled and egotistical celebrities who were making guest appearances at the big event. This drew the attention of Spider-Man, whose investigation was hampered by being sucked into the celebrity celebrations.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 42}}

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) from Peter Parker Spider-Man Vol 1 56 001.jpg|thumb|right|Sandman's conscience{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 56}}]]
[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) from Peter Parker Spider-Man Vol 1 56 002.jpg|thumb|left|Sandman's inner child{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 56}}]]
[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) from Peter Parker Spider-Man Vol 1 56 004.jpg|thumb|right|Sandman's dark side{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 56}}]]
[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) from Peter Parker Spider-Man Vol 1 56 003.jpg|thumb|left|Sandman's feminine side{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 56}}]]
[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) from Peter Parker Spider Man Vol 1 57 001.jpg|thumb|right|Sandman's insecurities{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 57}}]]
The Sandman then began seeking out other celebrities to fill the missing part of his body. However their star driven personalities began to have an effect on the Sandman, transforming him into a fame driven caricature. As he battled Spider-Man and consumed more celebrities, Sandman's body could no longer handle the foreign matter and he exploded, freeing all the celebrities trapped within.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 43}} The resulting explosion caused the facets of the Sandman's personality to fragment into separate personalities. First his inner-child, conscience and evil "Flint Marko" personality surfaced. while the inner-child and conscience sought a peaceful existence, the evil persona went on a rampage, drawing Spider-Man in once again. The wall-crawler encountered the good portions of the Sandman's personality, and convinced them to seek out his evil component. Along the way, they came across the Sandman's feminine side.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 56}} Spider-Man and the trio tracked down Sandman's dark side, and during the ensuing battle his inner child "grew up" into a manifestation of the Sandman's insecurities. Sandman's feminine side stopped the battle and convinced the evil side that they all needed to be together. The inner child, insecurities, and feminine side all merged with Sandman's evil persona, the only one holding back being his conscience who refused to merge with the others. Satisfied with this, the evil Sandman fled the scene, and once the majority of his parts were gone, the Sandman's conscience became inert and fell over, shattering on the ground. The Sandman was now totally reformed but apparently devoid of a conscience.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 57}}

====JLA/Avengers====
Shortly thereafter the Sandman's universe and the universe of a [[w:c:dc:New Earth|distant cosmos]] were at risk of destruction when the cosmic being known as [[w:c:dc:Krona (New Earth)|Krona]] attempted to merge them together. This plan was opposed by the Avengers and the [[w:c:dc:Justice League of America (New Earth)|Justice League of America]].<ref>See [[JLA/Avengers Vol 1]].</ref> The final battle took place on the corpse of the world devourer [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] where various members of the Avengers and JLA from different time periods were forced to fight an army of villains brought forth by Krona. As a one time Avenger, the Sandman was one of the many being pulled from time and space to participate in this final battle. Eventually the Avengers and Justice League defeated Krona and saved their universes from mutual destruction.{{r|JLA/Avengers #4}}

====Status Quo====
The Sandman was later coerced into working for [[Valeria Toomes (Earth-616)|Valeria Jessup]] who claimed to work for the legendary criminal known as Tristram Silver. Marko was gathered with Vulture, [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]], [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]], and [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]]. Jessup blackmailed them all into agreeing to steal the so-called [[Identity Disc]] that was in the possession of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|AIM]]. Even though the life of his mother was one the line, Marko did not buy into the [[Tristram Silver (Earth-616)|Tristram Silver]] angle and tried to fight back only for Jessup to shoot him with a special bullet that caused his sand form to dissolve, seemingly slaying the Sandman.{{r|Identity Disc #1}} The others went about their mission only to learn that the entire incident was a ruse laid out by Jessup and Sabretooth.<ref>See {{cl|Identity Disc #2}} through {{cl|Identity Disc #5|5}}.</ref> The Sandman had also deceived the others by faking his death so he could report to Tristram Silver and inform him what was being done in his name. He later met with Silver while vacationing in St. Lucia, where he was thanked for his services.{{r|Identity Disc #5}} The Sandman was later apprehended and incarcerated in the [[Big House]], a prison that used [[Pym Particles]] to shrink the inmates down to size. When the [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]] staged a break out, the Sandman was one of the many inmates who smuggled themselves out of the prison on the [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]]'s body.{{r|She-Hulk #5}} When She-Hulk later arrived at the offices of [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway (Earth-616)|Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]], the villains tried to escape. The Sandman was quickly recaptured when GLK&H's secretary [[Awesome Android (Earth-616)|Awesome Andy]] sucked him up in a vacuum cleaner.{{r|She-Hulk #6}}

Free again, the Sandman got into a drunken brawl with some college students until the fight was broken up by Spider-Man.{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #7}} The Sandman was later drafted into the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]]'s [[Sinister Twelve (Earth-616)|Sinister Twelve]] along with the Vulture, the [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Lizard]], the [[Herman Schultz (Earth-616)|Shocker]], Hydro-Man, Electro, the [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]], [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]], [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]], and [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Venom]]. When the Goblin tricked Spider-Man and the [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] into breaking him out of Ryker's Island prison, the Sandman and the others were waiting in surprise for the wall-crawler.{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #10}} Spider-Man and the Black Cat defeated the Sinister Twelve with the assistance of the Fantastic Four, Avengers and Daredevil.{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #11}} Spider-Man defeated the Green Goblin shortly thereafter.{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #12}} Later the Sandman clashed with both Spider-Man and the mutant known as [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], although the details of this battle are unrecorded.{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited Vol 3 14}} The Sandman was later seen at a card game between himself, the [[Jerome Beechman (Earth-616)|Mandrill]] and two other unidentified players.{{r|Daughters of the Dragon #4}} Later when the Thing was building a youth center in his home neighborhood of [[Yancy Street]], the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] sent the Sandman and Trapster to sabotage the construction because the Thing was not paying them a graft.{{r|Thing Vol 2 5}} The Thing stopped the two villains from blowing up the construction site with some help from Spider-Man. The Sandman was caught in the Trapster's paste and the pair were taken into police custody.{{r|Thing Vol 2 6}}

====Back in Black====
When the United States government enacted a new [[Superhuman Registration Act]], a [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]] broke out between superheroes who were for and against registration.<ref>See [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]].</ref> At the time Spider-Man was in support of the SHRA, and revealed his secret identity to the whole world on national television. Sandman was one of the many viewers who learned that Spider-Man was really Peter Parker.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #533}} Eventually, Spider-Man turned against registration and became an outlaw himself.{{r|Civil War #5}}

Sandman later learned that his father was now on death row, accused of murdering [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-6078)|Ben Parker]], who was trapped on Earth-616 from his native reality of [[Earth-6078]]. Knowing that his father was innocent, the Sandman sought out his old foe, tracking Peter Parker to the home of his long time friend [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Flash Thompson]]. Initially Peter Parker refused, showing the Sandman a family photo which also included his version of [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|Ben Parker]] who died years ago. The Sandman then shocked Spider-Man by telling him that was the man his father was accused of murdering.<ref>{{cl|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #17}}: [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-6078)|Ben Parker]] of [[Earth-6078]] got trapped in the [[Earth-616]] universe by the [[Robin Borne (Earth-9500)|Hobgoblin]] from the year 2211 of [[Earth-9500]] as depicted in {{cl|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #8}}. The [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|Ben Parker]] of [[Earth-616]] was murdered many years ago in {{cl|Amazing Fantasy #15}}.</ref>

Peter decided to help the Sandman after all, and the two went in disguise to learn what they could from the NYPD. When the Sandman's temper caused him to blow their cover, the pair decided to investigate the most obvious location, the cemetery where Ben Parker was buried. There they found a young man named Dennis who had acquired the helmet belonging to the recently deceased [[Max Borne (Earth-9500)|Spider-Man]] of the year 2211 of [[Earth-9500]].{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #18}} Using the helmet, Spider-Man and Sandman tracked the killer of Ben Parker to Midtown High School where the [[Chameleon (Earth-9500)|Chameleon]] of Earth-9500 was posing as the principal of the school. During the course of the battle, Spider-Man commanded the helmet of his future successor to mete out "poetic justice". By placing the helmet on the Chameleon's head, the Chameleon swapped places with Floyd Baker just as he was being executed. Floyd was unimpressed that the Sandman was unable to save him until the last minute, and although he finally learned that Flint Marko was his son, Floyd did not make mention of it.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #19}} Presumably, Floyd parted companies with his son to start a new life. 

Seeking to save the life of his [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|Aunt May]], Spider-Man later made a deal with the demon [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] to save her life. In exchange for saving May's life, Spider-Man agreed to allow Mephisto to alter reality so that he was never married to his wife [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]]. Part of the deal also saw that Spider-Man's true identity was erased from the minds of everyone on Earth, as such the Sandman no longer remembered that Spider-Man was Peter Parker.<ref>[[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|Aunt May]] was shot by one of the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]]'s assassins in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #538}}. [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] made his deal with [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #545}}. This altered reality so that the wedding of Peter Parker and [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]] in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21}} did not occur. Per {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #638}} & {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #639}} Peter and Mary Jane's relationship continued as it normally did, the only difference being they were never married. Per the latter issue [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] cast the spell that made everyone forget that Peter Parker was Spider-Man.</ref>

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) army of Sandmen from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 615.jpg|thumb|left|Army of Sandmen{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #615}}]]
====Keemia====
By this time, the Sandman had gained even greater control of his powers, able to animate any sand in his vicinity. He also spent many of his times in prison corresponding with [[Alma Alvarado (Earth-616)|Alma Alvarado]], a woman who was attracted to incarcerated super-villains. During his times out of prison he spent time with Alma and bonded with her daughter [[Keemia Alvarado (Earth-616)|Keemia]]. With the identity of Keemia's biological father a mystery, she eventually took to calling Marko "daddy". Unable to have children of his own following his mutation, the Sandman accepted this and began considering Keemia as his own daughter. Eventually, Keemia's mother began dating concert promoter Deshawn Price.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #615}}  During his next visit to see Keemia, the Sandman was told to leave by Alma. Sandman forced his way in to see Keemia, told the young girl that she deserved a diamond of her own one day, and left.{{r|Vengeance of the Moon Knight #9}} Unknown to the Sandman at the time, this was once again fragmenting his personality. The Sandman learned that Price had invested heavily in a music festival on [[Governors Island]] and kidnapped Keemia and brought her there. Convinced that she was a princess and the island was her kingdom, Keemia was willing to accompany her "father". Meanwhile, aspects of Sandman's personality that resented Alma and her new lover murdered the pair. These aspects literally turned into the murder weapons to kill their victims and allowed themselves to be gathered by the NYPD as evidence before returning to Governors Island. In his capacity as a photographer for the mayor's office, Peter Parker noticed the grains of sand when he accompanied an investigation of the lost "evidence" and eventually pieced together the mystery and tracked the Sandman down to Governors Island. There the Sandman held his own against the wall-crawler with his new powers, unleashing an army of Sandmen against his long time foe.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #615}}

Spider-Man was trounced and made a prisoner, but the wall-crawler tricked Keemia into freeing him. The Sandman tried to prevent Spider-Man from fleeing with the girl, but the hero tricked the Sandman into following him into a ventilation building that serviced Brooklyn/Battery Tunnel. There Spider-Man pushed the Sandman into a ventilation turbine, causing his body to be scattered all over the city. Spider-Man then turned Keemia over to his ally [[Glory Grant (Earth-616)|Glory Grant]] in the hopes that she would reunite Keemia with her grandmother. Unfortunately, Glory -- as an employee of the city of New York -- instead turned Keemia to child services and she was placed in a foster home instead.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #616}} When the Sandman reformed, he sought to steal the diamond that he promised to get for Keemia. This led to a battle with Spider-Man and the [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]]. Using his new powers to increase in size, the Sandman went on a rampage across New York City. The heroes lured the Sandman to the docking port of the USS Intrepid. There Spider-Man, Moon Knight, and the Knight's ally [[Jean-Paul Duchamp (Earth-616)|Frenchie]] disbursed the Sandman's body once again, this time using a subsonic jet engine to do the job.{{r|Vengeance of the Moon Knight #9}}

====Origin of the Species====
With [[Lily Hollister (Earth-616)|Lily Hollister]] about to give birth, the dying Doctor Octopus, believing the child to be the offspring of Hollister and Norman Osborn, sought to claim the child to use its unique [[Goblin Formula]] altered DNA to cure himself of his condition. He hired an army of supervillains, including the Sandman, to help him capture the Hollister, in exchange for whatever they wanted. The Sandman's motivation was to get Keemia back into his custody. The villains chased Lily to the [[Coffee Bean]], the business owned by her former boyfriend [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Harry Osborn]]. There, Doctor Octopus fought off Spider-Man, and when Lily went into labor, he delivered the child.<ref>{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #642}}: [[Lily Hollister (Earth-616)|Lily Hollister]] dated [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Harry Osborn]] from {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #545}} to {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #588}}. She was exposed to the [[Goblin Formula]] and became the villain known as Menace as revealed in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #585}} & {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #586|586}}. She became involved with Harry's father [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] in Amazing Spider-Man #588. She was revealed to be pregnant in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #595}} and led Harry to believe that their [[Stanley Osborn (Earth-616)|son]] was actually the offspring of his father Norman Osborn in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #598}}. The baby was revealed to be Harry's son in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #646}}. Sandman's motivation for trying to capture the baby was revealed in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #643}}. [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] was dying after years of severe head trauma caused his body to begin failing him, as revealed in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #600}}.</ref> Spider-Man recovered the newborn and fled to get it to safety, with the villains in tow. Sandman and Electro attempted to capture the child together, and were defeated when Spider-Man caused them to crash into each other, their powers working against each other.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #643}} When the baby was later captured by the Chameleon and Spider-Man was led to believe it had died, Spider-Man went on a path of vengeance against supervillains all over the city.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #644}} The Sandman and the Shocker sought refuge at the Pier 92 hideout of the Enforcers. Spider-Man tracked them down and sank the hideout into the water. Spider-Man then incapacitated Sandman with Shocker's vibro-gauntlets and then learned that the baby was still alive and was taken to [[Kravinoff Mansion]]. However Spider-Man was too late to stop the Lizard from kidnapping the baby from that location.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #645}} Eventually Spider-Man recovered the child, and after a test learned that it was just a normal baby and of no use to Doctor Octopus, foiling his plans.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #646}}

With his days numbered, Doctor Octopus began planning one final scheme before his body failed on him. He gathered a new Sinister Six consisting of the Sandman, Chameleon, Electro, Mysterio, and the [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]] to assist in this scheme. They first launched an attack of Octo-Mechs on New York City in order to keep Spider-Man and the Avengers busy while they infiltrated Andru Air Force Base to place Macro-Octobots on a spaceship stored there.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #648}} Still seeking to cure himself, Octopus captured [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] in order to force the hero to use his inventive genius to cure him. In order to force Iron Man to help, Octopus threatened to unleash a nuclear weapon. In addition he sent Sandman and Electro to [[Broxton]], Oklahoma to take Stark's ally [[Timothy Cababa (Earth-616)|Tim Cababa]] hostage. This hostage taking was interrupted by the arrival of Stark's assistant [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Pepper Potts]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man #501}} The two villains attempted to take Pepper hostage, but she used the powers granted by her [[Arc Reactor]] to hold them at bay. She was assisted in stopping Sandman and Electro by [[Sinclair Abbott (Earth-616)|Spymaster]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man #502}} While Pepper continue to fight the villains, Iron Man proved incapable of saving the life of Doctor Octopus. In admitting his inability to do so and begging for the lives that Octopus had threatened, Iron Man satisfied the villain's ego and he teleported his minions away, disabled his bomb, and let Iron Man go free.{{r|Invincible Iron Man #503}}

Seeking to gain access to the technology of Mister Fantastic, the Sinister Six tricked the newly formed [[Future Foundation (Earth-616)|Future Foundation]] into travelling to the Caribbean where Doctor Octopus kept the heroes busy with an interdimensional portal as well as robot duplicates of the Sinister Six.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #659}} While the heroes were distracted, the Sandman helped the other members of the Sinister Six by breaking into the Baxter Building. By the time the Future Foundation realized what was going on, the Sinister Six had taken what they wanted and fled.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #660}} The Sandman attempted to go on a solo jewelry store robbery, only to once again clash with Spider-Man. He was defeated when the wall-crawler tricked Flint into piercing a tanker truck containing liquid nitrogen, freezing the Sandman solid.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #661}} Sandman and the Sinister Six were next dispatched to the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in France. There they attempted to steal a fissile power generator. Doctor Octopus created various global threats to keep the Avengers busy so that they would be forced to send the novice [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]] to respond to their attack. Sure enough the Academy cadets were no match for the Sinister Six. Octopus then hacked into [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Giant-Man]]'s dimensional door technology so that they could escape with the generator.{{r|Avengers Academy #14}} When Doctor Octopus was later targeted by the [[Young Masters (Earth-616)|Young Masters of Evil]], he sent Sandman and Electro to deal with them. Both were incapacitated by the [[Teen Brigade (Earth-616)|Teen Brigade]]'s [[Ultimate Nullifier (Teen Brigade) (Earth-616)|Ultimate Nullifier]].{{r|Vengeance #3}} Ultimately the Young Masters were beaten back by the Teen Brigade.{{r|Vengeance #4}}

When Doctor Octopus later learned that a rival group of genius supervillains known as the [[Intelligencia (Earth-616)|Intelligencia]] were seeking to destroy the world with their Zero Cannon, he sent his Sinister Six to clash with them. During the fight, the Sandman clashed with his old ally the Wizard. Ultimately the Sinister Six won the bout when Doctor Octopus caused most of the Intelligencia to be jettisoned into space by their own weapon. They then sent Intelligencia leader [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|MODOK]] fleeing an destroyed the facility.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #676}} The Sandman was present when Doctor Octopus gathered the last of the technology he needed for his master plan when he wrecked a space station build by [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon Labs]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #681}} Prior to unleashing his final plan, Doctor Octopus sent the Sandman and Rhino to the [[Gamma Base|Hulkbuster Base]] in New Mexico to recover Alpha/Gamma Disruptor created by the [[Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)|Leader]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #683}}

The Sandman was present when Doctor Octopus unveiled his Octahedral device that he informed the world that he could use to either worsen or correct the advance of global warming on the Earth. Octopus then provided the data of his invention to the governments of Earth and claimed that he only sought to protect the planet from global warming. Not trusting Doctor Octopus, Spider-Man created a suit of armor to face off against the Sinister Six and assembled the Avengers to deal with him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #682}} The Sandman was present when Doctor Octopus led the Avengers into a trap along the Mediterranean Coast. Although they lost Electro in the battle, they incapacitated all the Avengers.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #683}} However, Silver Sable arrived on the scene and rescued Spider-Man and the Black Widow from captivity. Having convinced the world governments to follow through with his plans, Doctor Octopus had them wire 2 billion dollars into the bank accounts of each of his comrades and offer them full pardons under the law. Sandman was pleased that this would finally allow him to take custody of Keemia. Octavius then sent Sandman to guard a missile silo in the Sahara Desert where some of his space probes would be launched. He was attacked by Spider-Man, Sable, and the Black Widow who were shutting down the various missile silos across the globe.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #684}} Although the Sandman had access to the sand of an entire desert, he was defeated when Spider-Man was able to utilize the technology in his armor to extract the one grain of sand from Sandman that contained his consciousness. They contained this particle in a container and put enough sand for the Sandman to reform his head. They then threatened him with acid until he revealed the location of the last missile silo. However they were too late and Doctor Octopus revealed that he actually intended to destroy all life on Earth, unwilling to let humanity continue while he died.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #685}} Ultimately, Spider-Man defeated Doctor Octopus and foiled his plans.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #687}} The Sandman's head was later incarcerated within the Future Foundation's Baxter Building headquarters.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #17}}

While the Sandman was in captivity, Doctor Octopus managed to swamp minds with Spider-Man,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #697}} ultimately Spider-Man seemingly died while trapped in the failing body of Doctor Octopus, leaving Octavius free inside the body of Spider-Man. Otto swore to become a more superior hero than Spider-Man ever was.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #700}} For months, Doctor Octopus posed as Spider-Man, fooling everyone.<ref>See [[Superior Spider-Man Vol 1]].</ref>

====Superior Six====
While assigned by the Fantastic Four to babysit their young wards, the Future Foundation, Spider-Man recovered the head of the Sandman and kept him prisoner for months.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #17}} Spider-Man also captured Electro,{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #18}} the Chameleon,{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #20|21}} [[Mysterion (Earth-616)|Mysterion]],{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #22}} and the Vulture.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #1}} Using mind controlling Spider-Bots, Spider-Man enslaved his former allies in the Sinister Six. When the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]] attacked [[Alchemax (Earth-616)|Alchemax Inc.]] to steal a new prototype Quantum Particle Engine, the Sandman and the others were forced to be a part of Spider-Man's [[Superior Six (Earth-616)|Superior Six]]. With the assistance of the novice hero known as [[Selah Burke (Earth-616)|Sun Girl]], prevented the Wrecking Crew from stealing the device. Spider-Man took the generator with him when he and his Superior Six left the scene. Contained again, Sandman and the others vowed to kill Spider-Man for his violation of their personal freedom.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #5}}

Sandman and the Superior Six were then forced to battle a [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] [[Dreadnought (Robot)|Dreadnought]] robot. By this point the Wrecking Crew's employer [[Edward Lansky (Earth-616)|Lightmaster]] had reformed the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] and laid a trap to attack Spider-Man and his team. During the course of the fight, the quantum particle engine was struck by Lightmaster's light powers causing a massive energy surge that freed Sandman and the others from Spider-Man's control. They then turned on Spider-Man and Sun Girl, with Sandman using massive amounts of sand to attain a gargantuan height.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #6}} The Superior Six tortured Spider-Man until he was freed by Sun Girl. Eventually each member of the Six fell, the last being Sandman. Unaware that Spider-Man's body was now being controlled by his old enemy Doctor Octopus, Sandman found this violation more heinous because he believed that Spider-Man would never cross that line. Marko considered Spider-Man "dead" to him, before he was blasted by Sun Girl and his sand particles were scattered across the city.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #7}} Sandman was later recaptured and contained by Spider-Man once again and briefly imprisoned at his headquarters [[Raft|Spider Island II]].{{r|Superior Carnage #5}}

====Fall of the Fantastic Four====
The Sandman later found himself transferred back to Ryker's Island Prison where he was reunited with his one time ally the Thing, who was incarcerated pending a murder trial. Sandman informed Ben Grimm that the prisoners were all under the rule of his former lover the [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|She-Thing]] and expressed his suspicions that the villains were all transferred there in anticipation of the Thing's arrival.<ref>{{cl|Fantastic Four Vol 5 #9}}: Sandman's suspicions were correct, as revealed in {{cl|Fantastic Four Vol 5 #14}} this was all part of the machinations of the so-called [[Quiet Man (Earth-616)|Quiet Man]] who was seeking to destroy the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] and had apparently been manipulating them for years. The [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] was framed for the murder of the [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]] in {{cl|Fantastic Four Vol 5 7}}.</ref> The Sandman later silently watched as She-Thing defeated Thing in a one-on-one fight in the prison exercise yard.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 10}} Later during shower time, when the other inmates attempted to attack the Thing in the showers, the Sandman came to his aid, tripping up those who were attacking him.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 11}}

Later when the Thing asked why Marko came to his aid, Flint explained that he had learned that the Thing had been purchasing presents for Keemia while he was in prison and helped Ben in the shower out of gratitude. The two then began plotting to break out of prison in order to clear Ben's name.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 12}} With the help of the Fantastic Four and the She-Thing, the Sandman and Thing broke out of prison and where whisked away by Medusa and the Inhumans.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 13}} When the [[Quiet Man (Earth-616)|Quiet Man]] launched his all out invasion of Earth using the [[Avengers (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and mutated creatures from [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]]' [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Counter-Earth]] dimension, the Sandman joined the Wizard, Thundra, and She-Thing in a new Frightful Four to help fight back the invaders.{{r|Fantastic Four #644}} Ultimately the Fantastic Four ended the Quiet Man's invasion once and for all.{{r|Fantastic Four #645}}

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) from AXIS Revolutions Vol 1 3 0001.png|thumb|left|Sandman during World War Hate]]
====AXIS====
Following the [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]], the Sandman saw a number of his supervillain fraternity turning to the side of good. Deciding to relive his days of heroics and do something right, the Sandman foiled Boss Dixon from breaking out of Ryker's Island penitentiary. Although he succeeded in preventing him from breaking out, and freeing his friend Rico Ramone whom Dixon allowed to be incarcerated for murder, the media still painted him as the villain of the entire episode.{{r|AXIS: Revolutions #3}}

====The Eternal Sandman====
Marko started fearing for his mortality after he began to progressively lose control over the consistency of his body. He sought help from the Wizard and the Mad Thinker, but none could find a solution. Additionally, he occasionally slipped into reveries of his past, as well as moments from the alternate future of [[Earth-51838]]. When Sandman was hospitalized after one of his collapses, Spider-Man visited him. He escaped with Marko and took him to the beach where he spent his childhood, and offered him company until his body broke down and was swept by the wind.{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 308}}

[[File:William Baker (Earth-616) from Peter Parker The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 309 001.jpg|thumb]]
Sandman didn't actually die; he had simply lost the ability to take a human shape. However, Marko's new form was taken over by the [[William Baker (Earth-51838)|future version]] of himself. This future Sandman had lived for billions of years and wanted to escape the death of the Earth. Finding a way into the present through a rift between realities, the future Sandman took over the body of his past self. While fighting for control, Flint sought Spider-Man's help. When Spider-Man was caught in a sandstorm caused by the future Sandman, Flint realized he could hand over control of his sand form to another person. Flint transferred this ability to Spider-Man, giving him enough room to fight the future Sandman's takeover. With help from the Human Torch, Spider-Man used a device for multiversal travel called the [[Multisect]] which sealed the rift and sent the future Sandman back to his time, leaving him floating in the void of space. Spider-Man and Flint later bid farewell, with Sandman hoping to get used to his new form, while having developed a fear of his newly-discovered immortality.{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 309}}

When Doctor Octopus sought to reform the Sinister Six under the command of [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Kindred]], he located Sandman in a tropical beach, where Marko displayed the ability to assume a human shape once again. Sandman agreed to rejoin Octavius' new enterprise when the villain offered to put his scientific genius to use in returning Marko his mortality.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 68}}

| Powers                  = '''Sand Body:''' Sandman's body is an amorphous blob of animated sand. He originally possessed the ability to mold the sand into a shape that appeared to be completely human, and from that form convert his body (or parts of it) back into sand at will.{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 309}} How much control does he have over this form and how similar does it function to his previous state is not yet known.

'''Sand Control Transferral:''' Since Marko's original body is dead, he is capable of giving control of his sand form to another body. He once used this ability with Spider-Man.{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 309}}

'''Immortality:''' Sandman is immortal in the sense that he no longer ages. A possible future version of him had lived for billions of years.{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 309}}
* '''Self-Sustenance:''' Sandman also no longer require the need for food, air, or rest.{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 309}}

'''Body Conversion-Sand:''' Sandman originally possessed the superhuman ability to convert his body into sand by mental command. The sand functioned identically to, and appeared to be, normal flesh. However, he could convert all or parts of his body into animated sand at will. His brain had attained subliminal awareness of all granulated particles of his body. Through conscious effort, he could affect the degree of molecular cohesion between the numerous adjoining surfaces of his particles and thus cause locomotion of discrete volumes, down to the individual grains. There appears to be no limit to how long the Sandman could remain in his sand-state. If he had been to be rendered unconscious while in his sand-state, he would remain in that state, although the relaxing of his control over his particles would cause him to become an amorphous pile of sand. Sandman's mind continued to function in astral form even when he had turned his head into sand and even when the particles of sand that composed his brain were widely scattered. The limit to how far the particles of his brain can be dispersed before he was unable to reassemble is not yet known.
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' As a consequence of having a body composed of animated sand, the Sandman possessed phenomenal superhuman strength, able to lift up to 85 tons under optimal conditions.
* '''Density Control:''' His radically mutagenically altered body composition and increased density enabled him to compact or loosen the particles of sand that make up his form. Consequently, the Sandman can become as hard as sandstone, or disperse his body so that he becomes invulnerable to physical attacks. A favorite tactic of the Sandman is making himself slightly dispersed when an opponent punches him, and then making himself rock-solid again, entrapping his opponent's appendage.
* '''Shape-Shifting:''' He could shape his sand-state body into any continuous shape he can imagine, including his forearms into weapons like hammers, spiked maces, and large fists, forming ram horns on his head, stretching, elongating, deforming, expanding, flattening, or compressing all or portions of his body at will, like [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]], phase through small openings, etc.
* '''Sand Blasts:''' He could project his sand particles outward at high speeds and, when in the shape of a bulky object, with the impact of a large sandbag.
* '''Glass Generation:''' Sandman learned some new tricks from the [[Wizard]], including altering the formation of his sand particles and reshaping them into glass. This granted him the ability to reflect light and energy off of him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #2000}}
* '''Reformation:''' The Sandman maintained mental control of the particles of which his body is composed so that he could reform his scattered grains unless a substantial portion of his body mass has been isolated.
* '''Sand Conversion:''' He could also convert common grains of sand around him into constituents of his body to replenish portions he might lose track of during battle. In this manner, he could increase his overall size and volume (to some as yet unknown limit), or that of his limbs.
* '''Sand Clones:''' Thanks to having such good mental control over his own molecules, he was able to create duplicates of himself,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #615}} each one capable of acting on its own.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #616}}
** '''Giant Form:''' The clones, should they be in agreement, were all able to fuse together into a giant Sandman, about the size of an eight story building.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #616}}
* '''Wall-Crawling:''' He was somehow capable of using his sand to allow him to walk up walls.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #616}}

| Abilities               = The Sandman has an above-average knowledge of science, being self-taught.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 61}}
| Strength                = The Sandman is a superhuman being who is able to lift (press) up to 85 tons under standard conditions.
| Weaknesses              = '''Water:''' The Sandman's weakness that makes him most vulnerable is water. Water can soften his sand granules therefore, Sandman cannot control them and has to wait for them to dry.

'''Heat:''' Temperatures of 3,400 degrees Fahrenheit can cause his highly impure silicate composition to fuse into amorphous silicate (glass).

'''[[Glossary:Soul Molecule|Soul Molecule]]:''' Over the years, Spider-Man managed to discover that Sandman's consciousness is located in only one grain of sand, which has Marko's brain pattern and is responsible for commanding the other grains of sand what form to take. With the proper instruments, it can be induced to it different ideas which makes Marko change his form against his will. If that grain is separated from the another and isolated, Marko can't recover his mass.

{{Navigation

'''Clone Control:''' Sandman’s clones can influenced by his repressed and subconscious urges, such as when one of them killed Keemia’s mother and her lawyer for getting a restraining order placed on him, while another killed a concert promoter who was trying to set up a concert on Governors Island, where he had been hiding himself and Keemia. They will even fight each other should they disagree.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #616}} This weakness is no longer an issue after Sandman lost the ability to form clones.{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 308}}

| Equipment               = The Sandman briefly used a suit that he created with Reed Richards' stolen equipment, that he used to mix chemicals with his sand to create new effects. Some of the chemicals could make his sand into a slippery puddle, a sandstorm, solidify him to a brick-like form, adhere him to vertical walls, and coat him with a substance that would turn into a poisonous powder when heated by the Human Torch's flame.

* Sandman was one of the characters featured in Series A of the Marvel Value Stamps issued in the 1970's.
| Trivia                  = * This character appears in [[TSR, Inc.]]'s RPG adventure ''[[The Weird, Weird West]]''. In the plot, he had been hired by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] in 1968 to travel back in time to 1871 [[Dodge City]]. Alongside with other supervillains (including [[Nathan Garrett (Earth-616)|Black Knight]], [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Scorpion]] and [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]]), he was to provide support to Doom while he analyzed a time anomaly and tried to obtain profit from it. Doom took his lackeys (no name was provided for the team) to a [[Krozzar]] camp to deal with the Krozzars. Doom eventually found the origin of the anomaly, a [[chronovore]], but he and his lackeys were also found by time-traveling heroes from 1989, and defeated.
* Sandman doesn't have a driver's licence.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #19}}
