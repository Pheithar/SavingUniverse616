| HistoryText             = The Dawn of the White Light was a mutant death cult formed by [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 #20}} When he joined the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] and [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], Gorgon retained control of the organization. After the X-Man [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]] was killed, resurrected, and brainwashed by the Hand and Hydra, Gorgon ceded control of the Dawn to him.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 #25|27}}

| Notes                   = * It is unclear if the Dawn of White Light is supposed to be a splinter group from [[Marvin Hoffman (Earth-616)|X]], [[Marshal (Earth-616)|Marshal]] and [[Orwell (Earth-616)|Orwell]]'s [[Brotherhood (Earth-616)|Brotherhood]] or from the more famous [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood (also known as Brotherhood of Evil Mutants)]]:
** {{cl|Wolverine Vol 3 23}} hinted it was seemingly Magneto's although they were also stated to look down on [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood (also known as Brotherhood of Evil Mutants)]] and treated them like a joke when comparing their objectives.
** [[Japan]]'s entry in {{cl|Marvel Atlas #1}} mentioned that the Japanese cell of the Brotherhood ([[Marvin Hoffman (Earth-616)|X]]'s) was "nearly" wiped out, but that Dawn of the White Light remained operational.
