| History                 = [[Tamika Bowden (Earth-616)|Tamika Bowden]], a potential [[Olympic]] medal winner, was the victim of an unfortunate accident that confined her to a wheelchair for the rest of her life. Her father Dennis Bowden, a mechanical engineer who graduated with top honors from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]], created an exo-skeleton for her so that she could walk gain. His creation worked so well that Tamika became stronger, faster, and more agile than she ever was.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 26}}
