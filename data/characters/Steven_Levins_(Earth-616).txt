| History                 = Steve Levins was a mercenary who fought [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] as [[Jack O'Lantern]]. This incarnation of Jack O'Lantern was a member of the loosely-knit band of [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] minions called the [[Skeleton Crew (Earth-616)|Skeleton Crew]]. He was also a partner of Blackwing prior to joining the Skull's group. He also worked as an enforcer of the gangster The Golem and in this capacity, fought the villain The Hood when he interfered in Golem's machinations.{{Citation}}

Levins resurfaced just before the Stamford incident that sparked the [[Civil War|superhuman civil war]]. He was hired by the terrorist organization [[Radically Advanced Ideas in Destruction (Earth-616)|R.A.I.D.]] and, along with [[Jackhammer (Earth-616)|Jackhammer]] and [[Lancaster Sneed (Earth-616)|Shockwave]], was ordered to flood the Thames Tunnel, but their plans were singlehandedly foiled by [[Joseph Chapman (Earth-616)|Union Jack's]] intervention.{{r|Union Jack Vol 2 2}} All the villains were arrested and Jack O'Lantern was most likely deported back to U.S.A. and then recruited into the Thunderbolts hero-hunting squad.

While pursuing Spider-Man through the [[Manhattan]] sewers alongside the Jester,{{r|Civil War #5}} Jack O'Lantern was shot through the head and killed by the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]]; however, he later reappeared, possessed by a fragment of [[Lucifer (Earth-616)|Lucifer]]'s soul, and exhibited the ability to detach, levitate, and explode his head, among other powers. The [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] was able to eventually exorcise him by ripping his heart from his chest, setting it aflame, and putting it back in his chest, causing it to explode inside.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 6 8|11}}

Under unspecified circumstances, the [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Jackal]] obtained the corpse of Steven Levins and resurrected him in a new [[Glossary:Clone|cloned]] body. Back as Jack O'Lantern, Levins stayed with the Jackal, serving him at [[New U Technologies (Earth-616)|New U Technologies]].{{r|Prowler Vol 2 1}} Jack O'Lantern later appeared aboard the ''[[Queen Kathleen]]'', a gambling ship owned by [[Lonnie Lincoln (Earth-616)|Tombstone]]. He came into conflict with [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] when he stole twenty million dollars from the ship.{{r|Despicable Deadpool Vol 1 297}}

When working as a mercenary for the [[Foreigner (Earth-616)|Foreigner]], Jack O'Lantern franchised his identity into a group of [[Jack O'Lanterns (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lanterns]]. Unbeknownst to him, the four additional Jacks were sleeper agents working for the [[Karl Fiers (Earth-616)|Finisher]].{{r|Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: Chameleon Conspiracy Vol 1 1}} The Jack O'Lanterns assisted the Foreigner when Spider-Man and [[Teresa Parker (Earth-616)|Teresa Parker]] attempted to disrupt a deal between him and the [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 32}} They were lated deployed to help the Foreigner's new partner, [[Nicholas Powell (Earth-616)|Chance]], steal a [[Web-Shooters|web-shooter]] off Spider-Man for a bet.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 40}}

After Chance pressured one of his indebted patrons, college student and inventor [[Jamie Tolentino (Earth-616)|Jamie Tolentino]], into stealing a device called the [[Catalyst (Item)|Catalyst]] to power his own invention, a future-predicting artifact named the [[Clairvoyant (Item)|Clairvoyant]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 68}} the Jack O'Lanterns revealed themselves as double agents and attempted to steal both devices on behalf of the Finisher.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 69}} Levins helped contain the Jacks' rampage, fighting his namesakes.{{r|Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: Chameleon Conspiracy Vol 1 1}}
