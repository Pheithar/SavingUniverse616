===Early Life===
Antonio Rodriguez was born in San Antonio, [[Texas (State)|Texas]]. Not much is known about his life other than he had a criminal record and a wife named Maria Bonita Rodriguez. His wife critically stricken with an undiagnosed disease, Rodriguez took her to every doctor who would see her, but none was able to help her.{{r|Captain America #308}}

===Armadillo===
[[File:Antonio Rodriguez (Earth-616) from Captain America Vol 1 308 0003.jpg|thumb|left|Being turned into the Armadillo.{{r|Captain America #308}}]]
In desperation, Rodriguez sought the criminal scientist [[Karlin Malus (Earth-616)|Dr. Karlin Malus]], an expert in the generation and bestowal of superhuman powers, whom he heard about while in prison. Malus agreed to try to cure her in exchange for Rodriguez agreeing to become his test subject and employee for an indefinite period of time. Malus subjected Rodriguez to an experimental process that combined genetic material from an armadillo with the man's human genes. Dubbing Rodriguez the Armadillo he assigned him to break into the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|Avengers' West Coast]] compound to steal the comatose body of the villain [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Goliath]], a former subject of Malus who was being held there. Malus provided Armadillo with a serum to reduce Goliath's immense body to something he could transport discreetly.{{r|Captain America #308}}

Rodriguez agreed but found himself in combat with the visiting Avenger, [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. Although physically superior, Rodriguez lost due to Captain America's superior combat skills. Trapped in a net by Captain America, Armadillo decided to explain his situation (after all, he had been talking about a "life or death situation" during all the fight). Taking compassion on the Armadillo's plight, Captain America refused to turn him over to the authorities. Armadillo had to leave because during the fight he had lost the serum. Captain America suggested that Armadillo could ask Malus for more serum; however, Captain America wanted to follow Armadillo to Malus' hide-out. There, Captain America injured Malus. Malus ordered Armadillo to attack Captain America, but Captain America advised Armadillo not to; as they could inadvertently damage some artifact that may be vital for Bonita.

===Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation===
After Malus cured Bonita, Rodriguez then joined the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]]. The Armadillo became a major draw for the UCWF, and remained in his monstrous form to earn money for himself and his wife. Armadillo's manager was Lennie J. Feitler. He became a fan favorite and his victory over Doc Sawbones was seen by Captain America himself.{{r|Thunderbolts Annual #1997}}{{r|Deadline #2}}

[[File:Antonio Rodriguez (Earth-616) from Captain America Vol 1 308 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Armadillo{{r|Captain America Vol 1 308}}]]
When Rodriguez discovered Bonita was seeing another man, a person called Ramon, he went on a grief-stricken rampage, attacking even Feitler and Captain America, that was halted only when he jumped from the side of the [[Empire State Building]]. Gravely injured, he was reprimanded to police custody.{{r|Captain America #316}}{{r|Captain America #340}}

===The Vault===
Rodriguez served time in the super-villain correctional facility known as the [[Vault]]. Truly repentant, he awaited for parole. During the ''[[Armor Wars]]'', and due to [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] attack on the Vault, the center suffered a power outage and many prisoners were freed from their cells. Armadillo tried to run away alongside fellow runaways [[Mister Hyde]] and [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]]. However, she considered that Armadillo could slow the group and knock him away. Armadillo eventually escaped on his own, finding Captain America's van and a person protecting it: [[Vagabond]], one of Captain America's allies. Vagabond convinced Armadillo to surrender willingly and return to the Vault. She also convinced him to abandon his original scheme to get revenge on his unfaithful wife.{{r|Venom: Deathtrap: The Vault #1}}

Years later, [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] in disguise appeared in the [[Vault]] to help the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]] escape from the Vault. To do so, he set loose all of the prisoners. Iron Man tried to stop them, and he was attacked by many of the prisoners including Armadillo. Eventually, Armadillo escaped the Vault before Iron Man could seal it off. He was then summoned from his current moment by [[Isbisa]], a super-villain with time-control powers. Isbisa wanted to distract the [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] with some villains, including [[Caliban]], [[Jack O'Lantern]], [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]], [[Master Mold]], [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]] and [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] - but the villains attacked each other instead of She-Hulk, and so Isbisa could be easily defeated. The villains returned to the moment they were taken from.{{r|New Avengers #2}}{{r|New Avengers #4}}

During the ''[[Acts of Vengeance (Event)|Acts of Vengeance]]'', Armadillo fell under the mind control of [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] and was ordered, alongside many other villains, to attack the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] while they were giving a speech to Congress. Armadillo and his pals were defeated by [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|The Thing]], the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and the [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|She-Thing]]. Armadillo was sent back to the Vault.{{r|Fantastic Four #336}}{{r|Avengers Spotlight #26}}

Again at his cell on the Vault, Armadillo decided he should remain in prison, serving his sentence. [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]] engineered a new breakout from the Vault, but Armadillo did not support it. Alongside with Rhino and the [[Ebenezer Laughton (Earth-616)|Scarecrow]], Armadillo fought Venom's allies [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Klaw]] and the [[Controller]] - being soundly defeated. Armadillo tried to escape from the Vault during the following massive-breakout-used-as-diversion, this time engineered by the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] as a means to free [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Moonstone]]. Later, he claimed to be trying to ''stop the escapees'' instead of escaping himself, and was convincing enough. He was released under parole.{{r|Spider-Man: Breakout #1}}{{r|Spider-Man: Breakout #3}}

===Ultimate Fighting League===
[[File:Antonio Rodriguez (Earth-616) from Thunderbolts Vol 1 76 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Ultimate Fighter.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 76}}]]
Finally, Armadillo was contacted by Rey Trueno, owner of the Jersey branch of the Ultimate Fighting League. Armadillo trained under Coach Cody and became the regional champion in this new version of his former job. As a champion, he defeated a fighter known as [[Monster]]. However, he was mocked by the fans due to his monstrous aspect. Looking for a new champion who could be more marketing-appealing, Rey hired [[Daniel Axum (Earth-616)|Daniel Axum]], formerly known as the villain Battler, and began grooming him. Coach Cady did not help Armadillo to prepare his fight with Axum. During the match, Armadillo felt betrayed and tried to kill Axum, but Axum won the fight and became the new champion. Armadillo was left alone and became a beggar outside the building, ignored by his former partners. Axum saw him and bought him fast food. They talked and Axum discovered that Armadillo did not really hate him or any of the people who had defeated him. Armadillo was grateful to be alive and optimistic that the good times would come soon. With this speech, Armadillo unwittingly convinced Axum to stop his own plans for revenge against [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Thunderbolts #76}}

===Hercules===
However, Armadillo worked again with super-villains [[Frank Schlichting (Earth-616)|Constrictor]] and Jack O'Lantern to rob an armored vehicle. They were defeated by [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] and Armadillo was sent to the [[Raft]].{{r|She-Hulk #9}}

===New Warriors===
[[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]] assaulted the Raft to release [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]], and Armadillo was released from his cell - however, he was still chained to another prisoner, [[Todd Arliss (Earth-616)|Tiger Shark]]. Spider-Man and Captain America went to the Raft to investigate the situation, and the prisoners, including Armadillo, battled them. Armadillo and Tiger Shark later escaped from the Raft and hide in Fairbury, Illinois. There, he was identified by super-hero [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Speedball]] (of the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]]) posing as a pizza-boy. Not wanting to return to prison, Armadillo attacked. Armadillo was knocked down during the fight with the New Warriors, and rolled into a ball shape; Tiger Shark used him as a living mace. However, the New Warriors also defeated Tiger Shark, and the villains were re-imprisoned.{{r|New Warriors Vol 3 #1}}

===Civil War===
During the Civil War, he was spotted at the funeral of [[Wilbur Day (Earth-616)|Stilt-Man]].{{r|Civil War #7}} After poisoning the guests, the Punisher blew up the [[Bar with No Name]] in which the wake had been held. They all had to get their stomachs pumped and were treated for third-degree burns.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 #4}}

===The Consultant===
Around this time, he was seen entering the office of [[Consultant (Earth-616)|The Consultant]], a criminal PR agent of sorts who improves the reputation and occasionally powers of super-villains. Upon Armadillo's entering his office, the Consultant asked his secretary to cancel the rest of his appointments for the afternoon as he anticipated a lot of work improving Armadillo's image.{{r|Underworld #5}}

===The Rangers===
[[File:Rangers (Earth-616) from Avengers The Initiative Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|right|As a member of the Rangers.]]
When the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Fifty State Initiative]] was implemented, Armadillo became a member of [[Texas (State)|Texas]]' superhero team, the [[Rangers (Earth-616)|Rangers]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #2}} Antonio's stint as a superhero didn't last long, and was fired. Around this time, he fell in love with Texan model [[Daisy Schilling (Earth-616)|Daisy Schilling]], and they became a couple. However, after leaving the Rangers, Armadillo became distant, and Daisy left him believing that he didn't love her anymore.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 16}}

===MODOK's 11===
Antonio resorted to doing lucha libre wrestling in Mexico for small cash, and was eventually recruited by [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]].{{r|Super-Villain Team-Up MODOK's 11 #1|2}} After being one of the few villains who did not betray M.O.D.O.K., Armadillo earned more money than initially promised. He happily departed with [[Thomas Fireheart (Earth-616)|Puma]] and [[Tilda Johnson (Earth-616)|Nightshade]], with whom he'd developed a friendship, and showed a desire for them to remain as a team.{{r|Super-Villain Team-Up MODOK's 11 #3|5}}

===The Hood's Gang===
The Hood hired Armadillo as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act.{{r|New Avengers #35}}{{r|Dark Reign: The Cabal #1}}{{r|Dark Reign: The Hood #2}} Armadillo was incarcerated at [[The Raft]] next to [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] prior to the breakout during the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]].{{r|New Avengers #56}}

===Incredible Hulks===
The [[Incredible Hulks (Earth-616)|Incredible Hulks]] came upon a militia assaulting Armadillo. While the Hulk went head-to-head with him, She-Hulk went into town to investigate. She learned from one man that he heard of the Vill-Kill Korps, who pay for the location of superhumans and jumped at the offer. She-Hulk went out onto the field to diffuse the situation. She told Armadillo that though he's a wanted felon and attempted reformee, he should stay in the village and help out; in return, she may one day represent him in court. She then turned to the Vill-Kill Korps, telling them to leave.{{r|Incredible Hulks #616}}

===Attacking Houston===
After the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers vs. X-Men conflict]], a riot started into the prison, and the only heroes able to came suppress it were [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] and [[Calvin Rankin (Earth-616)|Mimic]]. Quickly outnumbered, [[Terrance Sorenson (Earth-616)|Equinox]], [[William Taurens (Earth-616)|Man-Bull]] and Armadillo himself offered to share their powers with them in order to defeat their fellows inmates.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #275}}{{r|X-Men: To Serve and Protect #4}}

[[File:Antonio Rodriguez (Earth-616) and Kaine Parker (Earth-616) from Scarlet Spider Vol 2 16 001.jpg|left|thumb|200px]]
One day after getting drunk, Armadillo disturbed a rodeo show in [[Houston]] which Daisy attended. He made a scene trying to prove his worth to her, and was confronted by Houston's own vigilante, the [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]]. Despite having recently become engaged to another man, Daisy ran up to Armadillo to admit that she still loved him, and they cleared up the misunderstanding that had led to their break up.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 #16}}

===Sinister Sixteen===
[[File:Antonio Rodriguez (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Vol 5 9 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Fighting The Thing.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 9}}]]
Boomerang recruited a small army of super-villains with the help of [[Leland Owlsley (Earth-616)|Owl]]'s connections and calling it the "Sinister Sixteen."{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man Vol 1 12}} The team eventually broke up after Boomerang had thoroughly screwed everyone over, including himself.{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man Vol 1 13}} Armadillo, working for [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|She-Thing]], was next seen attacking the Thing while they were both imprisoned at the [[Power House]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 #9}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 #12}}

===Hydra===
Armadillo later joined [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] after [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] promised to cure his condition in exchange for his allegiance. He took part in Hydra's plot to sterilize the human race by using Inhuman blood, but betrayed Zemo after [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Sam Wilson]], the new Captain America, told Armadillo that by serving Hydra, he'd be trading his soul and humanity just to be cured.{{r|All-New Captain America #1|4}}

===Sons of the Serpent===
Armadillo was later hired by Dr. Karl Malus in exchange for a cure to his condition. He aided the [[Sons of the Serpent (Earth-616)|Sons of the Serpent]] in a trafficking plot to ship illegal immigrants for a genetic experiment conducted by Karl Malus and fought Captain America. During the fight, Armadillo expressed his anger and frustration on Sam for not keeping his promise to cure him.{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson #2}}

===Running Away===
Antonio's rocky relationship with Daisy caused him to run away in order to escape his feelings, and he went on a rampage. He mostly got into fights with superheroes in the [[New York City|New York]] area,{{r|Jessica Jones Vol 2 18}} namely [[Groot (Earth-616)|Groot]],{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 16}} The Thing,{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 19}} [[Riri Williams (Earth-616)|Ironheart]],{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 4 6}} Spider-Man,{{r|Spider-Men II Vol 1 1}} [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]]{{r|Jessica Jones Vol 2 13}} and [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Miles Morales]].{{r|Spider-Man Vol 2 234}}
