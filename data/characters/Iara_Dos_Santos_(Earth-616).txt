===Jean Grey School===
'''Iara dos Santos''' was a regular [[Brazil]]ian girl until she began having a strong craving for fresh fish and transformed into a were-shark. Shortly after her powers manifested, both [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] and [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] attempted to recruit her to their respective causes. Iara initially refused both of their offers, prompting Mystique to try to take her by force. Angel was able to rescue Iara and brought her to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]], where she later decided to enroll and live part-time while returning to [[Brazil]] on the weekends.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 20}}

Later, she was among the students to go in the [[Frankenstein's Monster (Earth-616)|Frankenstein's Monster]]'s [[Murder Circus (Earth-616)|Murder Circus]], where she battled a mind-controlled [[Ava'Dara Naganandini (Earth-616)|Warbird]] and [[Zombie|zombie clowns]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 21|23}}

After that adventure, [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] took her and other troubling students to the [[Savage Land]], hoping they would learn to work together by being subjected to dangers they couldn't overcome alone.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 25}} The excursion didn't go as Wolverine planned due to a surprise attack by his missing brother [[Dog Logan (Earth-616)|Dog Logan]], but the students, with the exception of [[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob]], all came through and passed the special class.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 27|28}}

The months passed, and Iara began finding her place in the school,{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 38}} also growing more comfortable in her shark form, and rarely changing back to human.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 39}}

===Age of X-Man===
Iara was one of the many mutants that opposed the crazed [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] from remaking the world in his image. When X-Man realized that his vision of the world would never come about with the X-Men around, X-Man made his enemies vanish in an instant, including Iara.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9|10}}

Iara and the others were transported to another [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|plane of existence]] created by X-Man in an attempt at a utopia where every mutant would be at peace, altering their memories so they wouldn't resist.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}} There, Iara was happy as a student of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Summers Institute for Higher Learning]] and a member of its Agricultural Division,{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 1}} but eventually the illusion fell apart and everyone was returned to the real world.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

===Krakoa===
After returning from the Age of X-Man reality, Iara became a citizen of the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] and she was seen celebrating when Krakoa was officially recognized as a nation.{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}} While there, she appeared to have become friends with the former Morlock [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]],{{r|Women of Marvel Vol 2 1}} and the two even went on missions with the [[Dark Riders (Krakoa) (Earth-616)|Dark Riders]] together.{{r|X-Men: Curse of the Man-Thing Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = Iara is a new [[Homo superior|mutant]] activated after the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] dispersion and has displayed the following mutant powers:{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 20}}

* '''''Selachothropy:''''' Iara can transform into a shark. She can also retain full memory of herself, and therefore has her human consciousness while in her shark form, although not always under control.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 20}} Other effects include:
** '''''Amphibious physiological adaptation:''''' Her hybrid physiology means she can survive indefinitely underwater or on land.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 20}}
** '''''Superhuman strength:''''' As Wolverine describes, Iara has a punch that can shatter cinder blocks.{{citation}}
** '''''Superhuman speed:''''' Iara has impressive speed underwater. {{citation}}
** '''''Sharp claws and fangs'''''{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 20}}
