| History                 = Katie Power is the youngest child of [[James Power (Earth-616)|Dr. James Power]], a physicist who was working for the [[United States Government (Earth-616)|United States government]] on a means of producing large quantities of energy cheaply through combining matter and [[Glossary:A#Anti-Matter|anti-matter]]. (The sub-atomic particles composing anti-matter have opposite charges to those of the equivalent particles of matter itself. When matter contacts anti-matter, both are converted entirely into vast quantities of energy).{{r|Power Pack #1}}

An alien [[Kymellian]] named [[Aelfyre Whitemane (Earth-616)|Aelfyre Whitemane]] learned of Power's discovery and intended to stop it from being used. Whitemane knew that a device such as Power's would, despite Power's good intentions, trigger a chain reaction that would destroy the [[Earth]]. Moreover, he knew that Power's device was sought by the alien [[Z'nrx]], nicknamed "[[Snarks]]," who intended to use it to conquer inhabited worlds.{{r|Power Pack #1}}

Snarks captured Dr. Power and his wife Margaret, intending to force him to reveal the secret of his device. Whitemane saved the Powers' children. Alex, Julia, Jack, and Katie, from being captured, but he himself was fatally wounded in the process. Dying, Whitemane transferred each of his superhuman powers into one of the four children, and asked them to use their new abilities to save their world.{{r|Power Pack #1}}

Katie named herself the Energizer, after her own power, and the four children called themselves the [[Power Pack (Earth-616)|Power Pack]]. Being only five years old at the time, Katie thus became one of the youngest superheroes ever. Power Pack thwarted the Snarks, rescued their parents, and destroyed Dr. Power's dangerous matter/anti-matter converter, thereby saving the Earth from destruction. The four children have since continued to have adventures as Power Pack.{{r|Power Pack #2|3}}

Recently Katie was asked by [[DeMarr Davis (Earth-616)|Doorman]] to join the [[Great Lakes Avengers (Earth-616)|Great Lakes Avengers]] during their recruitment drive after the death of [[Dinah Soar (Earth-616)|Dinah Soar]] and the apparent mental breakdown of [[Craig Hollis (Earth-616)|Mister Immortal]]. Like many other superheroes, Katie rejected the offer.{{r|G.L.A. #2}}

At some point, Energizer briefly rejoined the [[Power Pack (Earth-616)|Power Pack]] and teamed-up with [[Devil Dinosaur (Earth-78411)|Devil Dinosaur]], [[Gwendolyn Poole (Earth-TRN565)|Gwenpool]], and [[Lunella Lafayette (Earth-616)|Moon Girl]].{{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 25}}

Energizer can project "power balls" of force from her chest, which carry great destructive impact. In order to amass enough energy to form the "power balls," Energizer must disintegrate an object and absorb the released energy into herself. Apparently Energizer does not convert all of the matter she disintegrates into energy, or create nuclear reactions within it; if she did, she would release far more energy than she has so far. Probably she disintegrates matter by severing the bonds holding its molecules together. Energizer prefers to derive energy by disintegrating solid objects or liquids; gases, except in impractically large amounts, could not give her sufficient energy. When charged with energy, Energizer's body often glows with crackling power.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #4}}

At first she had little control over her power, and would accidentally fire power balls on becoming angry or frightened. Moreover, the power balls would fly off in all directions from her chest. With practice and determination, however, Energizer has since learned how to fire the power balls when she wishes to, and in the specific direction she wishes. There are undefined limits to the amount of time she can contain certain amounts of energy within her body, and she sometimes may be forced to release power balls simply to rid herself of excess energy.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #4}}

Through practice with the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlock]] [[Erg (Earth-616)|Erg]], Energizer has learned how to absorb energy fired at her and then use it to create power balls. It is as yet unclear whether she can do this with all forms of energy or not.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #4}}<!-- also a mention to be added in the history text -->

Energizer's power is limited by the amount of energy she can absorb. She can easily absorb and release enough energy to destroy several steel beams at once, as she did when she caused a building under construction to collapse upon the being known as [[Algrim (Earth-616)|Kurse]]. Straining to her utmost limit, Energizer once absorbed tremendous amounts of mystical energy from the enchanted hammers of [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] and [[Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616)|Beta Ray Bill]], and released it upon Kurse. It was enough power to stun that being, who was then over twice as strong as Thor, into unconsciousness. Presumably as Energizer grows bigger, she will be able to surpass her present limits in utilizing her power.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #4}}
