But death wasn't the end for dad, just the terrible beginning. There was this cosmic entity named [[Kronos (Earth-616)|Kronos]] who needed a champion to keep [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] in line. He grabbed my dad's soul and used it to animate his hero. So pop became the lumbering behemoth known as [[Drax the Destroyer]]. I guess even back then part of me still loved the guy. Didn't stop me, though, from killing him a second time.

===Early Life===
[[File:Heather Douglas (Earth-616) from Infinity Wars Fallen Guardian Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|Young Heather]]
'''Heather Douglas''' was the daughter of [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Arthur Douglas]], whose reanimated corpse was made into [[Drax the Destroyer]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 32}} When Heather was still a girl, her father was driving her and her mother through the desert when they accidentally happened to see the spaceship of [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] land; the space villain didn't want any witnesses, so he blew their car up. Heather was thrown clear off and survived, but her parents were killed. She was found by Thanos' father, [[A'Lars (Earth-616)|Mentor]], who took her to his home world, [[Titan (Moon of Saturn)|Titan]], to be raised by the Titanian Shao-Lorn monks in their monastery. While there, Heather studied the [[Titans (Eternals)|Titans]]' ways and disciplines to unlock her latent psychic potential and gained her mental and physical powers. However, she came under the influence of a powerful entity called the [[Dragon of the Moon (Earth-616)|Dragon of the Moon]]; she believed she had resisted it, which filled her with pride, and she took the name Moondragon as a result.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 138}} Sometime later, Thanos attacked Titan, destroying the monastery and the Shao-Lom monks. Moondragon escaped in her spaceship and fled to [[Earth]].{{citation}}

===Avengers===
She first returned to Earth under the guise of "Madam MacEvil" for the purpose of developing means to combat Thanos; this led to the creations of some villains, like [[David Angar (Earth-616)|Angar the Screamer]]. She forced [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] to battle [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] in order to study them.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 54}} She then revealed her true identity and helped the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] in their first confrontation with Thanos, as well as becoming an applicant for membership for a time. Moondragon was one of the three candidates to be the "[[Celestial Madonna (Earth-616)|Celestial Madonna]]" who was prophesied to give birth to a universal savior, but she lost to [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]]. While with the Avengers, she met [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Patricia Walker]] who became the heroine Hellcat.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 144}} Even though Walker wanted to join the Avengers, Moondragon convinced her to accompany her to Titan so she could train her.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 150}}

Moondragon was present when the Avengers confronted [[Michael Korvac (Earth-691)|Korvac]]; her powers allowed her to see into his mind while they fought, and she decided that his goal of saving [[Earth-616|the universe]] by ruling it was noble. She stayed out of the battle until Korvac dejected and committed suicide.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 177}}

===New Defenders===
Moondragon left Earth with her father (who was now Drax) and found a planet immersed in war, so she decided to take mental control of all its inhabitants to force them to live in peace. This caused her to believe herself to be like a goddess. When Drax confronted her, she killed him with her mental powers. The Avengers intervened, and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] took her before a real god -- his father, [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] -- to be judged.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 219|220}} Odin perceived within Moondragon a stalwart but tainted spirit. He condemned her to wear a magical headband that would reduce her mental powers until she had overcome her arrogance. He also assigned the [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] to be her guardian.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 125}}

When Valkyrie rejoined the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]], Moondragon was forced to come along. She soon discovered that the Dragon of the Moon had been influencing her all along. She managed to reject it fully, and for the first time, started to gain friends in the team; eventually, the headband came loose by itself. Unfortunately, soon after she was infected with mutated spores and started to die; the Dragon appeared again and told her it could save her life, but only if she agreed to be its host. She accepted, and, now an evil being, battled the Defenders, until four of them sacrificed themselves to kill both her and the Dragon.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 152}}

===Resurrection===
Heather's soul managed to survive, and, now free from the Dragon again, contacted a cousin of hers. Through her, she was able to obtain a new body for herself; a clone created on Titan. For a while, she and her cousin, who became the heroine [[Pamela Douglas (Earth-616)|Sundragon]], adventured together in space.{{r|Solo Avengers Vol 1 20}}

===H.D. Steckley===
After [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]] was appointed Protector of the Universe, Moondragon insinuated herself into his life. She was convinced that in time, Quasar would realize they were eminently qualified to be the universe's most cosmic coupling. Quasar, however, asserted that qualifications have nothing to do with feelings and rebuffed her. She eventually got the message and lost interest in him.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 11|29}}

===Infinity Watch===
When [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]] sought people to help him safeguard the [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Gems]], he chose Moondragon to keep the [[Mind Stone|Mind Gem]], but only after erecting safeguards so she could not exploit the gem's full power. Still, she agreed to join his team, the [[Infinity Watch (Earth-616)|Infinity Watch]].{{r|Warlock and the Infinity Watch Vol 1 2}} The gem was eventually stolen by [[Rune (Earth-93060)|Rune]].{{r|Rune/Silver Surfer Vol 1 1}}

===Relationship===
Moondragon later became an associate of [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Genis-Vell]] (the third [[Captain Marvel]]), determined to help him control his cosmic awareness. During this time, she fell in love with [[Marlo Chandler (Earth-616)|Marlo Chandler]], the wife of [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] (whom Captain Marvel was bonded to). The two eloped to the reluctant understanding of Rick. Sometime later, Marlo got over her feelings for Moondragon and decided to return to Rick. Moondragon told her she must have accidentally prodded her telepathically into the relationship, but this was a lie to make the break-up easier; in truth, Moondragon was heartbroken. She left shortly after with [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-616)|Phyla-Vell]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 24}}

===Annihilation Wars===
While Moondragon and Phyla-Vell were visiting the graves of [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Mar-Vell]] and Genis-Vell, Thanos appeared and kidnapped Moondragon, using her as a hostage to draw out Drax the Destroyer for an unknown purpose. He also used her to read [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]]' mind, learning that the Lord of the [[Negative Zone]] intended to use the captive [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] to destroy all life in both their universe and his dominion. This revelation prompted Thanos to decide to free Galactus and turn against Annihilus, but Drax killed him before he could do so. Thankfully, Drax was able to coerce the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] into releasing his master. The Devourer of Worlds then teleported to safety as he destroyed a great portion of the [[Annihilation Wave (Earth-616)|Annihilation Wave]].{{r|{{cl|Annihilation Vol 1 2}}-[[Annihilation Vol 1 6|6]]}}

[[File:Heather Douglas (Earth-616) and Phyla-Vell (Earth-616) from Annihilation Conquest - Quasar Vol 1 3 001.jpg|thumb|right|Quasar and Heather in her draconic form]]

Surviving the Annihilation Wave, and with her ear regrown by the Priests of Pama, Heather and Phyla (now [[Quasar]]) took on the mission to find "the savior" to free the [[Kree Empire]] from the [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]]. During the adventure, the Dragon of the Moon changed Heather into a draconic form, intending to take full control of her body within weeks. Despite the fact that Heather would never be able to return to human form, Phyla remained by her lover's side.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Quasar Vol 1 1|4}} Their time together was ultimately cut short as the leader of the Phalanx, [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]], killed her by plunging his arm into her chest. Heather died in Phyla's arms{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 3}} and her soul was sent to [[Oblivion (Earth-616)|Oblivion]] inside the Dragon of the Moon.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 11}}

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
As part of a plan to give [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]] a new avatar, [[Maelstrom (Earth-616)|Maelstrom]] manipulated the former Drax and Phyla into taking interest in bringing Heather back to life. They sought [[A'Lars (Earth-616)|Mentor]]'s help and he killed them so their souls would be sent to Oblivion to rescue Heather's. In order to save her lover, Phyla accepted to become the new avatar of Death and rescued Heather from within the Dragon with her newfound powers. Heather was subsequently resurrected in a cloned body on Titan for the second time.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 11|12}} Drax and Phyla (now [[Martyr]]) later rejoined the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], bringing Moondragon with them.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 13}}

[[File:Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 20 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|With the Guardians]]
With Phyla's apparent death at the hands of [[Magus (Earth-7528)|Adam Magus]],{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 19}} Moondragon took it upon herself to become a field agent for the Guardians of the Galaxy. However, she became host to an alien parasite originating in [[Earth-10011|a parallel universe]] across the [[Fault]], a time-space tear created by [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]]'s [[Terrigen Bomb]]. She was biometrically cuffed by [[Lena Sendak (Earth-616)|Cynosure]], who intended to have the creature tried for killing one of her fellow [[Luminals (Earth-616)|Luminals]]. To make things worse, members of the [[Universal Church of Truth (Earth-616)|Universal Church of Truth]] kidnapped Moondragon and Cynosure, seeing the parasite as a god whom they intended to birth. Luckily, the Guardians and Luminals mounted a joint rescue attempt and extracted the two. With the help of [[Knowhere]]'s medical staff, they were able to remove the organism from Moondragon. During these experiences, Moondragon had visions of a cocoon and Phyla being alive.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 20|24}} Sadly, Phyla was killed by a resurrected Thanos, which caused Heather to lash out at him before [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] subdued the Mad Titan with a [[Cosmic Cube]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 25}}

Despite wanting Thanos dead, Moondragon assisted [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]] in keeping the Mad Titan in check while probing his mind to find out why he had returned to the world of the living. After Adam Magus detonated the Church converted worlds to open the Fault further, Thanos managed to escape captivity and attacked the Guardians,{{r|Thanos Imperative: Ignition Vol 1 1}} but was soon subdued again. Afterwards, the Guardians decided to take Thanos to the universe on the far side of the Fault in order to stop its invasion of their reality.{{r|Thanos Imperative Vol 1 1}} They ultimately succeeded in their endeavor, but it cost them the lives of Drax, Star-Lord, and Nova.{{r|Thanos Imperative Vol 1 2|6}}

[[File:Heather Douglas (Earth-616) from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 5 001.jpg|thumb|right|Knowhere Corps outfit]]

Moondragon, Mantis, and [[Bug (Insectivorid) (Earth-616)|Bug]] left the Guardians and eventually joined a new team called the [[Knowhere Corps (Earth-616)|Knowhere Corps]]. They apprehended [[Yotat (Earth-616)|Yotat the Destroyer]] after the Guardians had dealt with him.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 5}} The team seemingly disbanded with the destruction of Knowhere,{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 6}} which the [[Black Order (Earth-616)|Black Order]] stole in order to attack the reading of the last will and testament of Thanos.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 1}}

Not long afterward, Heather came to learn that a more heroic alternate counterpart of [[Heather Douglas (Earth-18897)|herself]] from [[Earth-18897|Reality-18897]] had become displaced to her reality. In addition to having joined the Guardians of the Galaxy, Heather discovered that this Moondragon was accompanied by her world's own version of [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-18897)|Phyla-Vell]]. Fueling Heather's feelings of abandonment and inadequacy, the Dragon of the Moon corrupted Heather and pushed her to seek out this other version of herself.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 5}} When the Guardians of the Galaxy split up over Star-Lord's aparent death during a mission against the [[Olympians]], [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]] formed [[West Spiral Arm Guardians (Earth-616)|her own Guardians team]] to return to their mercenary ways, and Moondragon joined it.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 3}}

The team's first mission, an assignment for [[Castor Gnawbarque III (Earth-616)|Castor Gnawbarque III]], pitted the two Guardians teams against each other.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 3}} Moondragon took advantage of this clash to personally confront her counterpart out of spite and out of jealousy. The heroic Moondragon was victorious in their duel of the mind, but she decided to merge with her counterpart as a way to console her by sharing everything she had.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 5}}

This gesture caused the other Moondragon's Phyla-Vell to become distant toward the composite Moondragon, since she felt uncomfortable that her wife's soul had merged with somebody that was virtually a stranger to her,{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 7}} and didn't know where "her" Heather ended and the other one began.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 11}} During the Guardians' final fight against the Olympians, who were heralded by the returned Star-Lord, Moondragon was telepathically attacked by [[Hermes Diaktoros (Earth-616)|Hermes]]. Managing to enter into Moondragon's mindscape, Phyla professed that she wished to know and love the entirety of the new Moodragon, both patching up their relationship and giving Moondragon the necessary boost to defeat Hermes.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 12}}

| Powers                  = '''Psionics:'''  Heather Douglas is one of the most powerful human born telepaths in existence. Douglas has repeatedly demonstrated psionic powers rivalling and, on some occasions, surpassing human and human mutants, including that of the world-renowned telepaths such as Charles Xavier and Emma Frost.

Douglas' most notable psychic actions were the complete mental enslavement of an entire warring planet of people,{{r|Avengers #220}} psionically stalemating the sorcerer supreme Doctor Strange for an extended period of time, and mentally killing a clone of Thanos endowed with psionic powers greater than Professor X,{{r|Infinity Abyss}} as well as being able to briefly pierce the mental barriers of Galactus and even enabling Thanos to almost overwhelm the devourer's mind when channeling her powers.{{r|Thanos #3}}.

Unlike human mutants such as Xavier whose powers operate as part of their biology, all of Douglas' mental powers originate from her supreme level of mental discipline, hence her concentration and ability to focus on the accomplishment of that task. All of Douglas' mental processes are largely maintained subconsciously as the power and its effects will continue if she is rendered unconscious or falls asleep as done when her control of an entire planet's populace. But she must always consciously initiate the process for it to be performed.

If Douglas is distracted or unable to focus her mind to accomplish an event, she can be rendered completely mentally powerless, as shown when Rick Jones held her captive with a pair of headphones pumping heavy metal tracks.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 4 6}}

Douglas' mental psionic powers include:
* '''Telepathy:''' Douglas possesses the ability to contact sentient minds both organic and mechanical based, as well as cosmic beings such as Galactus. Her telepathic abilities include mind-control, mental attacks, mental shielding, personality alteration, memory erasure, memory modification. Douglas telepathic range is almost limitless, as she is able to contact minds across a solar system without enhancement devices such as Xavier's [[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebro]].
* '''Telekinesis:''' Douglas's telekinetic range is low to moderate as she can only demonstrated the ability to levitate herself and a few others at the same time. Douglas can "push" her telekinetic ability on herself to attain flight or use it offensively as powerful concussive blasts.
* '''Dragon Form:''' For a time, Moondragon gained the ability to assume the form of her namesake: A superhumanly strong and durable dragon, capable of faster-than-light speed travel and surviving in outer space without air. It is unknown whether or not she retains this ability.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest #2}}

She was stated to have a "planetary" threat level by the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]].{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files #1}}
| Abilities               = '''Genius Scientist:''' Douglas is an expert in various advanced Titanian sciences as well as Earth human sciences. She has been able to give powers to [[Ramrod]] and [[Angar the Screamer]],{{r|Daredevil #105}} and was able to give [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] his eyesight back.{{r|Daredevil #106}}

'''Master Martial Artist:''' Douglas is a superb alien hand-to-hand combatant, trained by the Titanian monks of Shao-Lom who were veteran practitioners in martial arts. Having trained herself to be as strong as one of her size and weight can be without having superhuman strength, Douglas is well versed in pressure points. And she has even defeated [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]],{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}} [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]],{{r|Infinity War #4}} and [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]{{r|Warlock and the Infinity Watch #27}} in hand-to-hand combat.

'''Aviation:''' Douglas is a skilled starship pilot.{{r|Iron Man #54}}

'''Nervous System Control:''' Mental and physical disciplines gave her improved control over her autonomic body functions, including those of heartbeat, bleeding, breathing, and pain reception.{{r|Defenders #143}}
| Strength                = Douglas possesses low-level superhuman strength (punch through steel with her bare hands), endurance and stamina all due to her mental conditioning. Douglas cannot maintain these levels without her concentration, however. If she is not able to focus her mind to force her body to higher levels, she will adapt the levels of her base human levels as maintained through intensive regular exercise.
| Weaknesses              = All of Douglas' superhuman abilities are based on her ability to concentrate. Her human body while brought to the peak of its potential without enhancement, still needs to sleep, eat and breathe. She cannot maintain those levels without rest and replenishment such as when she forced herself to endure open space travel without protective suits only for a short period of time to save her life.

| Equipment               = Douglas possessed the Infinity Gem known as the "mind gem". The artifact enhanced her psionic powers by an undefined degree. Douglas no longer has the mind gem.
| Transportation          = Various including the Starship ''[[Sensia]]''.
| Weapons                 = Douglas uses conventional weapons such as staffs and bullet guns as well as exotic weapons such as plasma weapons.

| Notes                   = * Heather's and Marlo's lesbian relationship was rare for a mainstream comic book at the time, especially with two established characters.
* The fact that Heather, although a born human, has acquired psychic powers is of extreme importance, as it indicates that the human brain has the potential of self-evolving to the level of a mutant's brain, even without the aid of the [[Mutant Genes|X-gene]].
| Trivia                  = * Douglas is not naturally bald. Douglas shaves her head preferring to be bald, though has worn short hair in the past.
* Just like [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]], Heather was also a candidate to become the "[[Celestial Madonna]]", but failed, since she didn't live as a true human.{{r|Giant-Size Avengers Vol 1 4}}
