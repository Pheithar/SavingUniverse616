===Origin===
While [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] lay in a comatose state, [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Dr. John Sublime]] harvested eggs from her to begin experimentation. The [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus program]] then used the eggs to create thousands of identical [[Homo superior|mutant]] girls in the hope of developing a powerful weapon capable of killing every mutant on [[Earth]] by combining their [[Telepathy|telepathic abilities]]. The project was designated '''[[Weapon XIV]]''', and the girls were incubated and artificially aged inside the subterranean level of [[The World]].{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #4}} While most girls remained dormant, five were sent to infiltrate the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] as student sisters to hone their talents for Sublime's purpose.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #3}}{{r|New X-Men #118}}

[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 1 134 001.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Sophie and her sisters strutting in the halls of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Institute]]]] 
===Xavier Institute===
After the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] went public,{{r|New X-Men #117}} Sophie and her sisters were enrolled as orphan quintuplet sisters.{{r|New X-Men #118}} To protect their secret origins, the girls unconsciously placed mental blocks in the minds of the faculty preventing them from investigating their background.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #2}}

The girls quickly gained the moniker "'''The [[Stepford Cuckoos]]'''", though their chosen codename was the '''[[Five-In-One]]'''. [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] took a special interest in the girls, and the Cuckoos became her protégés.{{r|New X-Men #126}}{{r|New X-Men #134}}

[[File:Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 1 137 0002.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The death of Sophie]]
===Death===
Much to her disapproval, the girls' rival, [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire (Kid Omega)]], developed a crush on Sophie. Sparked by Sophie's rejection, learning that he was adopted, his uncontrolled powers, and fueled by use of the drug [[Hypercortisone D|Kick]], Kid Omega led a rebellion of [[Omega Gang (Earth-616)|students]] at the X-Mansion. To stop Kid Omega and his [[Omega Gang (Earth-616)|Omega Gang]], Sophie and the other Cuckoos covertly snuck into [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]]. Using Kick to amp up her powers, Sophie and her sisters were able to stop Quire. Unfortunately, Sophie died in the process.{{r|New X-Men #137}} Unbeknownst to the others, Sophie was actually being influenced into these actions by Esme, who was also using Kick.{{r|New X-Men #141}}{{r|Chaos War: X-Men #1|2}}

===Resurrection===
When the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] returned to Earth in search of a new host, Kid Omega was awakened. Still in love with Sophie, Kid Omega exhumed her in hopes of reuniting.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Endsong #2}}{{r|X-Men Phoenix Endsong #4}} However, upon her resurrection, she promptly rejected Quire and died once again.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Endsong #5}}

When an unstable fraction of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] sparked inside the girls, their dormant [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus]] nanotech inside their bones was activated. This nanotech briefly reanimated Sophie and Esme, who directed their sisters back to [[The World]] to activate [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Sublime]]'s plan for the destruction of the [[Homo superior|mutant race]]. Sophie and Esme were later killed by [[Celeste Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Celeste]] wielding the Phoenix.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #1|5}}

===[[Chaos War]]===
[[File:Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616) Carrion Crow (Earth-616) Chaos War X-Men Vol 1 1.png|thumb|right|300px|Sophie transformed by the [[Carrion Crow (Earth-616)|Carrion Crow]]]]

When the [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (Earth-616)|Chaos King]] put the living asleep and opened the underworld, Sophie, [[Esme Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Esme]], [[John Proudstar (Earth-616)|Thunderbird]], [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggert]], and several dupes of [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]] were among the resurrected. Sophie confronted Esme about her death with little resolution. While searching for answers among the remains of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]], the former X-Men were attacked by the [[Carrion Crow (Earth-616)|Carrion Crow]]. Sophie sacrificed herself to save the others,{{r|Chaos War: X-Men #1}} and Esme later sacrificed herself to save her sister. As she and John Proudstar faded back into the afterlife, John mused perhaps that next time he was resurrected, he and Sophie would be together. Sophie replied that she liked the idea.{{r|Chaos War: X-Men #2}}

===House of X===
Sophie was at some point resurrected by a group of mutants known as “[[Five (Earth-616)|the Five]]” ([[Eva Bell (Earth-616)|Eva Bell]], [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]], [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]], and [[Fabio Medina (Earth-616)|Egg]]).

She was living on the sovereign nation state of Krakoa for mutants, created by Charles Xavier, Magneto, and Moira X. The Stepford Cuckoos and Magneto welcome a delegation of international ambassadors and representatives to give them a quick tour of this new world (showing them the new [[Jerusalem Habitat|Jerusalem Habitat]]) while setting the terms of the new mutant state and its relationship to humanity.{{r|House of X #1}}
