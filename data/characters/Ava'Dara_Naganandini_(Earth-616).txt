===Origin===
'''Ava'Dara Naganandini''' is an elite [[Shi'ar]] warrior of the '''[[Warbirds (Earth-616)|Warbirds]]''' assigned to protect the ruling family. Warbird was born in a breed art warehouse in [[Chandilar]]'s flesh bazaar district. Her "father" was an automated seed sprinkler and her "mother" was one of the thousands of frozen eggs harvested each month from female factory workers as part of their government-mandated body-tax. Warbird's birth mother was an alien slave brought from a conquered world whose body wasn't meant to birth a Shi'ar and so she died after giving birth to Ava'Dara. Ava'Dara worked in a war factory and learned how to assemble a pulse cannon before she learned how to talk. Ava'Dara loved to draw as a child but she would burn her drawings as she considered what she liked wasn't the way of the Shi'ar. She trained and gained the Warbird title in an academy.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men Vol 1 13}} At an unknown point in her life she conducted "mating rituals" with someone while trapped inside another being and surrounded by flesh-eating monster aliens.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men Vol 1 7}} After showing mercy to a child in a mission, the Shi'ar wanted her to hate children, so her punishment was that she was sent by [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Emperor Gladiator]] to escort [[Kubark (Earth-616)|Kid Gladiator]] as his personal bodyguard. Kid Gladiator was sent to Earth as a punishment for destroying more than half of the Shi'ar royal city on Chandilar, so she was brought with him to "protect" Gladiator's son from danger.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men Vol 1 1}}{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men Vol 1 13}}

===Jean Grey School for Higher Learning=== 
Warbird arrived with Kid Gladiator to Earth on the first day for school. During an attack on the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School of Higher Learning]] by [[Krakoa III (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], Warbird fought Krakoa and the Frankenstein monsters. When [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] formed a group of ice-clones to fight Frankenstein monsters, Warbird showed some romantic interest in one of the ice-clones.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men Vol 1 2}}

===Exodus' Attack===
When [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]] attacked the Jean Grey School and the students were sent to the safe room for their safety, Warbird went with Kid Gladiator and refused to let [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] take part of his power to fight Exodus. When Rogue teleported and took part of his power through a kiss on the cheek, Warbird became enraged and said she would kill her, but Kubark told her she was pardoned by royal decree.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #261}}

===The Brood Attack===
Warbird tried to stop Kid Gladiator from entering [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty]]'s body but failed.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men Vol 1 5}} When she entered Kitty's body along with the other X-Men, they found Kid Gladiator only to lose him again. When they found him again, they discovered that he wasn't himself, as the Brood turned him into one of them.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men Vol 1 6}}

Warbird and Iceman were left to hold Kid Gladiator while [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] tried to destroy the egg sac inside the infested Kitty. After Kid Gladiator used his heat vision on Iceman's head, Iceman responded by restoring his face and beating Kid Gladiator up, to which Warbird asked him to stop. Later on, Warbird confessed to Bobby that she considered him to be, without a doubt, the most vigorous male she had encountered since arriving to Earth and asked him if he ever conducted "mating rituals" with someone while trapped inside another being and surrounded by flesh-eating monster aliens, because she had once; to which Bobby answered with a low voice that it was a good time for Kid Gladiator to melt off his ears. After the egg sac was destroyed and Kid Gladiator was subdued, the team left Kitty's body through her mouth. While Kitty was taken by S.W.O.R.D. to be cured of the remained Brood inside her, she kissed Bobby while Warbird was watching and she did not seem too happy about it.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men Vol 1 7}}

===The Marauders===
Warbird entered [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]]'s apartment with a decapitated head in her hand saying: it has begun. When the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] broke into the apartment, she helped the team fight them.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 48}} When Iceman was hurt by [[Chimera (Earth-TRN220)|Chimera]], she was shown to be worried about him. She chose to fight [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]] from the Marauders and told him she would find a way to cut his head off. When Iceman covered the area, she thought it was magnificent. When Bobby noted she was looking at him in a weird way, she told him she wanted to conduct "mating rituals" with him immediately.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 49}}

===Return to the Shi'ar===
Warbird eventually left Earth and rejoined the Shi'ar Empire. She later joined the Shi'ar in its fight against the [[Asgardians]].{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 15|16}}{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 18|19}}
