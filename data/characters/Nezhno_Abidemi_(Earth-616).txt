===Origin===
Nezhno Abidemi is the son of a [[Wakanda|Wakandan]] [[Nezhno Abidemi's Mother (Earth-616)|woman]] and a [[Russia|Russian]] [[Nezhno Abidemi's Father (Earth-616)|man]]. All his life Nezhno was persecuted and rejected, even by his own mother, because his father was an outsider, and it was from him whom Nezhno inherited his [[X-Gene]].{{r|X-Men Divided We Stand #1}} Nezhno was raised at the [[Royal Palace of Wakanda|Royal Court of Wakanda]].{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #2}} When his [[Homo superior|mutant]] powers manifested, [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Ororo Munroe]], the new queen of Wakanda, advised her husband [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|King T'Challa]] to send Nezhno to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]] to learn how to control his powers.{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #1}}

As a consequence of the abuse he endured when he was a kid, Nezhno developed a psychological trauma,{{r|X-Men: Red Vol 1 6}} which caused him to suffer great pain and seizures.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 39}} To ease his condition, Nezhno's entire body was covered with [[Vibranium]] tattoos to prevent him from over-exerting and killing himself with his power.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}}{{r|X-Men Divided We Stand #1}}

===Xavier Institute===
Nezhno found the atmosphere at the Xavier Institute to be very distracting, and tried to distance himself from other students, rarely talking with them, considering them too unfocused and chaotic.{{r|X-Men Divided We Stand #1}}{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #3}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 37}} Trying to subdue his emotions and powers, he spent all his free time meditating.{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #1}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 37}} Perhaps for that, and because he was a pacifist{{r|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}}, he was given the codename '''Gentle''',{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 38}} and was immediately placed on Storm's [[Storm's Squad (Earth-616)|squad]] so she could take a hands on role in his development.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 13}}

===M-Day===
In the aftermath of [[M-Day]], Nezhno was one of the 27 remaining students from the Institute to retain their powers. In response to the increasingly desperate situation that mutants now faced, [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] disbanded all of the former training squads. She decided to select an elite team of New X-Men trainees and organized an all out battle in the [[Danger Room]] between the remaining students. Due to the nature of Nezhno's powers, he was exempt from the session.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 23}}

===Limbo===
One night at the school, Gentle tried to meditate, but was constantly distracted by loud chatter of other students, who listened to a horror story told by [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]]. It soon became clear that this wasn't just a tale, but rather Blindfold's visions of past, present, and future events about [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Illyana Rasputina]], and the [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Demon Lord Belasco]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 37}} As soon as the tale ended, Gentle and other students were teleported to [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]] and immediately attacked by demons. Even so, Nezhno was able to stay calm, and was reluctant to use his powers.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 38}} Only when [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Darkchild]] arrived did Gentle follow the advice of Blindfold and, for the first time in his school days, used his powers. He tried to protect [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] from demon [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]], but the pain and spasms quickly brought him out of action.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 39}} After the students returned to the school, Pixie thanked him for his help. She was delighted with his powers and surprised that Nezhno never used them before. In response to that, Nezhno told her that every time he uses his powers he approaches his own death.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}}

===Messiah Complex===
When the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|first mutant]] since [[M-Day]] was [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|born]], most of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] went looking for her; only students and several members of the team stayed in the Institute. Shortly thereafter it was attacked by an out of control [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E (Earth-616)|Sentinel Squad O*N*E]]. Believing that the Sentinels planned to kill them all, Gentle decided to fight at full strength, regardless of the consequences for his health or life. Nezhno fought with the Sentinels on equal terms, but still in the end he was blasted away and lost consciousness.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #493}} Later, he once again used his powers to protect fellow students from [[Predator X]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 46}}

===Return to Wakanda===
After the X-Men were disbanded, Nezhno, together with Queen Ororo, returned to Wakanda. Doctors examined his body and found that his condition worsened during his time in the United States and, therefore, he needed more tattoos.{{r|X-Men Divided We Stand #1}} All he ever wanted was to be accepted by his own people{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #2}} and had hoped that during his absence the Wakandans changed their opinion of him. Unfortunately, Nezhno quickly ascertained that everything remained the same and even his mother, whom he hadn't seen for many years, berated him for returning to Wakanda. Once again rejected by his country, Gentle finally realized that the only people who ever accepted him were the X-Men, and regretted that he pushed away those who tried to be his friends.{{r|X-Men Divided We Stand #1}}

These negative emotions allowed the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] to possess Gentle's body and use it to kill the soul reader [[B'Chaku (Earth-616)|B'Chaku]]. Nezhno was arrested, but Storm freed him from prison, believing that he could not commit murder. Unfortunately, the Shadow King was able to take possession of T'Challa and declared that Storm and Gentle were traitors and ordered for their detention. At first Nezhno was ready to surrender, and to be executed for his crime, but Storm forced him to fight and flee. In the end, they managed to defeat the Shadow King and saved not only Wakanda, but also the X-Men. After that, Nezhno decided to return to America.{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #1|4}}

===San Francisco & Utopia===
He joined the X-Men at [[Graymalkin Industries]] in [[San Francisco]]{{r|Uncanny X-Men #509}} and later relocated with them to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]].{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Exodus #1}} When the island was attacked by Predators X, Nezhno with a few other students lent his powers to [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] so she could fight the Predators.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #517}} After the [[Second Coming|return]] of the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Mutant Messiah]] and subsequent attack of the [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod Sentinels]], Gentle was amongst those who fought back at [[Golden Gate Bridge]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 14}}

===Jean Grey School for Higher Learning===
After the [[Schism (Event)|schism]] between Cyclops and Wolverine, Gentle decided to join Logan's [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]], thinking that in order to create a better world for mutants, they needed to live as if it already existed, not preparing everyday to war for survival.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}}

When it was discovered that the [[Terrigen Mist|Terrigen Mists]] spread throughout the atmosphere of the Earth were lethal to mutants, [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] moved the Jean Grey School to the extra-dimensional realm of [[Limbo (Otherplace)|Limbo]], in order to protect its students from both the mists and the ever-growing anti-mutant hysteria. Gentle was one of those mutants living in [[X-Haven]], the portion of Limbo used as the new grounds for the school.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men #1}}

===X-Men Red===
Nezhno eventually returned to Wakanda.{{r|X-Men: Red Vol 1 2}} He assisted [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]]'s team of [[X-Men (Jean Grey's) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] after they were attacked by a brainwashed Storm when they were returning to Wakanda from a mission, since they had been offered asylum by King T'Challa. Nezhno even shielded Storm from lightning of her own making after the [[Nano-Sentinels|Sentinite]] controlling her mind pushed her into trying to commit suicide. Jean later convinced Gentle to join her team, both because of his strength and his compassion, and offered to help him work on blocking his pain so he could unlock his full potential.{{r|X-Men: Red Vol 1 4}} During Nezhno's first session of telepathic therapy, Jean found out that the pain he suffered when he used his powers was not tied to them, but was actually a subconscious mechanism to prevent himself from using his powers. His mother would hit him every time he manifested his mutation, causing Nezhno to develop the psychosomatic block. Jean used her powers to heal Nezhno's psychological wounds, which also allowed him to regain his sense of touch.{{r|X-Men: Red Vol 1 6}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Nezhno was one of the many mutants that opposed the crazed [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] from remaking the world in his image. When X-Man realized that his vision of the world would never come about with the X-Men around, X-Man made his enemies vanish in an instant, including Nezhno.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9|10}}

===Age of X-Man===
Nezhno and the other mutants were sent to a [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|different reality]] created by X-Man where he attempted to create a utopia where they and all other mutants lived in peace but with their memories erased so they didn't resist.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}

Nezhno was one of the students who were part of the Agricultural Division at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Summers Institute for Higher Learning]]. He was seen walking past all the other students in the lunchroom while they were talking. After lunch, Gentle attended [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Ms. Guthrie]]'s class as she was showing them that taking care of the produce and livestock at the Institute was vital as the community heavily depended on it.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 1}}

While not seen, Nezhno was presumably sent back to the real world when X-Man decided to release the mutants he trapped in his reality.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

===House of X===
Nezhno later became a resident of the new mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. He and the rest of the Krakoa celebrated when Krakoa was recognized as an official nation.{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}}

'''Muscle-Mass Expansion:''' Nezhno has the ability to increase the muscle-mass of his body, allowing him to drastically increase in size and strength almost instantly.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 39}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #493}}
* '''Extreme Strength:'''{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 38}} The upper limit of Nezhno's strength has not been categorized, and he has shown himself strong enough to hold his own in battle against a [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E (Earth-616)|Sentinel]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men #493}}{{r|X-Men: Schism #5}} as well as [[Predator X]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 46}}{{r|X-Men Divided We Stand #1}} Storm stated that his physical strength rivals that of [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]],{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #1}} placing him at least Class 100 strength. Nezhno's resting strength gradually increases every time he uses his powers.
* '''Superhuman Durability:'''{{r|Uncanny X-Men #517}} Nezhno's body is very tough; he is able to withstand high atmospheric pressure,{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #4}} point-blank shot,{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #2}} [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]' optic blast,{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #4}} and Sentinel laser blast.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #493}} It was stated that at his peak, he could go toe-to-toe with the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]].{{r|X-Men: Red #2}}

* '''[[Vibranium|Vibranium Tattoos]]:''' Nezhno has tattoos all over his body, which were adapted from molten [[Vibranium|raw vibranium]], using an ancient Wakandan technique developed to alleviate seizures and tremors. Usually tattoos were temporary, however, Gentle's mutation caused vibranium to bond with his flesh down into the muscle.{{r|X-Men Divided We Stand #1}} According to Nezhno these tattoos keep his powers in check and is the only thing that keeps him alive, but at some point it will no longer be able to help him.{{r|X-Men Divided We Stand #1}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}} When he uses his powers, the tattoos glow with blue light. Recently all Wakandan vibranium was rendered inert and useless,{{r|Doomwar #6}} but it is yet unclear what effect it had on Nezhno.

| Notes                   = * Nezhno was the last-revealed of the 27 remaining powered Xavier students, and it was unknown if he was cataloged among the 198 (as he wasn't among the mutants presented in the {{cl|X-Men: The 198 Files #1|198 Files}}).
* His name "Nezhno" ('''Russian:''' Нежно) is a Russian word meaning "tenderly" or "gently", while his surname "Abidemi" is a Yoruba word meaning "born during father's absence".{{r|{{cite web|url= https://www.behindthename.com/name/abidemi|title= Abidemi|accessdate= 2018-08-03|date= 2013-01-25|work= Behind The Name}}}}
* He is the first X-Men member to come from a [[Wakanda|country]] that only exists within the Marvel Universe.
