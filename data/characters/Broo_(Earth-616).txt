===Origin===
[[File:Broo (Earth-616) from Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 40 001.jpg|thumb|left|Broo in his first appearance]]
Broo is a mutant of the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] race, born in the lab on the orbital research station known as [[Pandora's Box (Space Station)|Pandora's Box]], where [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] studied his race. Like [[No-Name (Earth-616)|No-Name]] of [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]'s [[Warbound (Earth-616)|Warbound]], he understands compassion and friendship, which disgusts the other members of his race. When the Brood Queen escaped and freed her warriors, they left him in his stasis tube. Usually, this [[Brood (Race)#Benign Brood & Mutants|kind of Brood]] is killed at birth, but the Brood population was so low that the Brood-Queen opted to spare him instead.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 40}}

As the Brood seized the station, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], [[Lockheed (Earth-616)|Lockheed]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] went there to rescue [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]]. However, during the battle Abigail was infected by Brood larva, which gave her access to the hive-mind. She learned that the destruction of the Brood home world led to the near-extinction of the race, causing an imbalance in the interstellar ecosystem. The X-Men then decided to develop a plan to save the Brood, but didn't endanger humankind in the process. They planned to "reprogram" the hive-mind, using [[No-Name (Earth-616)|No-Name]] as a new template, but Brand told them about this unnamed teen mutant, who could be used for the same purpose. The X-Men freed him and he helped them defeat the Brood.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 #38}}{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 #40}}{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 #42}}

[[File:Broo (Earth-616) from Wolverine and the X-Men Alpha & Omega Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Broo as a student]]
===Jean Grey School===
After this he returned to Earth and joined [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s X-Men at [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #1}} When the school was attacked by the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] and [[Krakoa III (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], he met [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie]], who he found had never before felt feelings before, who gave him the name Broo. {{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #2}} When the inspectors of the education departments turned into monsters, he tried talking to them in the hopes that they would regain their senses. They attacked him, but [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]] stepped in and telepathically turned the monsters against each other.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #3}}

When [[Evan Sabahnur (Earth-616)|Genesis]] was enrolled in the school, everyone noticed that he looked like [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] except Broo (who had never seen or heard of Apocalypse). He welcomed him. In a special lecture, [[Deathlok Prime (Earth-10511)|Deathlok]] gave the students the probabilities of their futures. He told Broo that there was a 22.3% chance that in the next three years he would discover a cure for cancer, and a 34.7% chance that during that time he would murder and consume at least four of his classmates. He responded by saying "Well, that is rather... fascinating."{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #4}}

During the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers vs. X-Men conflict ending]], Broo assisted [[Iron Man (Anthony "Tony" Stark)|Iron Man]] and [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] in the search of a way to defeat the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #15}} 

[[File:Broo (Earth-616) from Wolverine & the X-Men Vol 1 19.jpg|thumb|left|After having been shot]]
===Feral Broo===
Not long after, during the Jean Grey School dance, he followed Idie to a church, where he encountered the priest. After a brief talk about Idie that angered him, Broo's feral side took over and he decapitated the priest, only to discover that he was a robot placed there by the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] in order to make Idie leave the school and join the Hellfire Academy. [[Kade Kilgore (Earth-616)|Kade Kilgore]] and [[Maximilian Frankenstein (Earth-616)|Max Frankenstein]] soon showed up and told Broo about their plans, but he is shot and left for dead before he can tell anyone else. His apparent death and the shut down of his Cerebra signal was first unseen, covered by the bloom of new mutants caused by the Phoenix.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #18}}{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #21}}

[[File:Broo (Earth-616) from Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 28.jpg|right|thumb|Feral student]]
He was later found in the church and immediately treated. Beast performed micro-surgery in his cranium, assisted by [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Brand]], and contacted [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]], [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] and Tony Stark, without results as the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] biology wasn't well understood.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #19}}

Eventually, Broo woke up from his coma, but in a brain-damaged state, rendering him a feral beast similar to a regular Brood.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #14}} As Beast failed to revert him to his normal state, he asked [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] to take him along for his [[Savage Land]] field-trip.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #25|28}}

===Hellfire Academy===
[[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie]] left him at the school to join the [[Hellfire Academy (Earth-616)|Hellfire Academy]], having discovered that the Hellfire Club were responsible for him being shot and wanted to avenge him, due to possibly being in love with him.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #29|30}} Soon after, Beast brought Broo to the [[Peak VII]], to consult the biologist/murderer [[Xanto Starblood (Earth-616)|Dr. Xanto Starblood]], the foremost known Brood physiologist expert. However, Starblood declared that Broo was a perfect specimen, and would not help to restore his previous personality. Immediately, Starblood spoke Brood in order to agitate Broo, and Hellfire Club's [[Philistine (Earth-616)|Philistine]] teleported into the space station. 

After a brief fire-exchange with [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] agents, Starblood and Broo were extracted by the Philistine, who teleported back to [[Earth]] then took [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]] and went with her and his two guests to welcome [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]] and Quentin Quire into the Hellfire Academy.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #30}} While at the Hellfire Academy, Idie confirmed that Broo had been shot by [[Kade Kilgore (Earth-616)|Kade Kilgore]], the Black King of the Hellfire Club.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #34}}

When Wolverine and the X-Men finally discovered the location of the Hellfire Academy, a battled ensued between the school's faculty and the X-Men. During the fight Xanto Starblood took Broo aboard his spaceship and attempted to flee. While on the ship Broo saw a [[Bamf (Earth-5311)|Bamf]] and bit it. Broo then attacked Xanto, which caused the ship to crash. After the fight Broo returned to the Jean Grey School, where he was examined by Beast, who discovered that Broo had regained his intelligence after biting the Bamf.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #35}} Broo babysat Jubilee's adoptive son [[Shogo Lee (Earth-616)|Shogo Lee]] for a time.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 6}}

When the Jean Grey School moved to the middle of Central Park and was rebranded as the Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach, Broo returned as a trusted student.{{r|Generation X Vol 2 1}}

Later, he left the X-Men, and joined the [[Agents of Wakanda (Earth-616)|Agents of Wakanda]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 13}}

===Dawn of X===
He was seen standing near to [[Angelo Espinosa (Earth-616)|Skin]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] at the party on [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] following the first meeting of the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}}

After the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] brought the [[Kree|Kree's]] [[King Egg]] to Krakoa, this caused entire armadas of Brood to go to Earth and retrieve the artifact.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 8}} Broo, alongside the X-Men and the [[Shi'ar Empire]]'s [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]], tried to fend off the Brood to no avail, until Broo accidentally ate the King Egg which caused Broo to become the new King of the Brood.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 9}}

| Powers                  = '''Compassion:''' Broo is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] of his [[Brood (Race)|race]], because he can feel compassion and friendship. More specifically, he was born separate from the Brood Hive-mind mentality and intuitive devotion to the Brood Queen. Without the innate drive to serve felt by other Brood, Broo developed the ability to make his own decisions.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 42}}
* Other Brood have been forcibly separated from their Hive, and in their desire to form a new Hive-bond acted more benign and befriended other species, like [[No-Name (Earth-616)|No-Name of the Warbound]]. Broo is different because his Hive-separation occurred while he was still among his fellow Brood. No-Name would likely revert to a traditional Brood mentality if reintroduced to a Hive.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 92|95}}

'''[[Brood|Brood Physiology]]:''' Broo presumably possesses all the traditional physical capabilities of a Brood, as his mutation was reportedly only a mental difference. However, because the Brood are a parasitic race who adapt the characteristics and traits of their host organisms, "traditional" Brood physiology varies. Broo appears significantly more bi-pedal than other Brood,{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 1}} even those born from previous bipeds.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #167}} He has yet to demonstrate the tail, stingers, or wings Brood usually possess.
| Abilities               = '''Super-Genius Intelligence:''' Broo is one of the smartest students at the school, potentially matching with [[Iron Man (Anthony "Tony" Stark)|Tony Stark]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #15}} His intelligence had vanished for a time because of his injury.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #35}} 
| Strength                = 
| Weaknesses              = '''Brood Instincts:''' Thanks to his [[X-Gene]], Brood is able to suppress his natural Brood instincts to kill and consume, but they are always there. When he lost his intelligence, his instincts returned, causing him to attack his friends and classmates. His intelligence returned following his bite of a [[Bamf]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #35}}{{Verify source}}

| Notes                   = * Broo has a crush on [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie]] and upon their first meeting he even proposed marriage to her.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #2}}
* Broo wears his glasses because he thinks they make him less intimidating.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #3}}
* Broo was a vegetarian, before being brain-damaged, and pretended to be back to his old habits once healed, although [[Josephine Bricklemoore (Earth-616)|Josephine Bricklemoore]]'s showed that he was killing and eating animals around the Mansion. He was seen covered in blood with his glasses off, holding his legs in his arms, as if he were stuck between his two natures.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #39}}
* One of the [[Nova]] is his favorite super-hero.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #15}} Though his comment on Nova being his favorite superhero was made back when [[Samuel Alexander (Earth-616)|Sam Alexander]] was almost completely unknown, Broo was later seen completely fanboying over Sam when the two met.{{r|A + X #17}} This means that Broo is either a huge fan of the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]] in general, somehow knew about Sam prior to the events of ''Avengers vs. X-Men'', or is simply confusing Sam with [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Richard Rider]].
* When asked if Broo's presence in the mutant-exclusive [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] meant he had an [[X-Gene]], editor [[Jordan D. White]] clarified that he was only there was a visitor.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cracksh0t/status/1190787248352047104|title=Jordan D. White on Twitter: "He was visiting. He is their friend."|work=Twitter|date=November 2, 2019|accessdate=January 13, 2020}}}} {{cl|X of Swords Handbook Vol 1 1}} would later establish that Broo was effectively a citizen of Krakoa.
