Starting as an enemy of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]],{{r|X-Men Vol 1 130}} and clashing with the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]]{{r|{{cl|New Mutants Vol 1 15}}-[[New Mutants Vol 1 17|17]]}} and [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]],{{r|New Warriors Vol 1 10}} she later had a tragic accident that changed her heart for the better, leading her to form a partnership with [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 281}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 314}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 316}} Putting her love for teaching to good use, but never afraid to cross the line of the "morally correct", she became the co-headmaster of the new '''Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters''', where she trained the latest generation of mutants, known as [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 314}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 1}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 30|31}}

| History                 = 
===Family Background===
Emma Grace Frost was born to a [[Boston]] mercantile family, which arrived from [[England]] in the 1600s and took part in [[American Revolutionary War]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 4}}{{r|New Mutants #26}} The second of three daughters, Emma also had an older brother named [[Christian Frost (Earth-616)|Christian Frost]], who had turned to substance abuse as an escape from the drudgery of his life and the abuse of his father. Unknown to their family or themselves, the three Frost sisters were [[Homo superior|mutants]], whose [[Telepathy|telepathic]] abilities matured upon reaching their puberty.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 48}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: X-Men 2004 Vol 1 1}} Deemed unfit in her father's eyes, Emma produced low-grade point averages and was a social outcast while attending the [[Snow Valley School for Girls]]. As a result of her emerging powers, Emma began to experience severe migraines.{{r|Emma Frost Vol 1 1|2}}

[[File:Emma Frost Vol 1 8 Textless.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Young Emma Frost]]
Shortly after this, Emma made everyone in the school unconscious during a mental breakdown, and [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] detected her presence. Alongside [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Dr. Moira MacTaggart]], he paid Emma's father a visit hoping she could join his school, but the whole trip revealed itself a waste of time when both Emma and her father manifested aversion to the idea.{{r|X-Men Origins: Emma Frost Vol 1 1}}

After the emergence of her powers, Emma used them to excel in all aspects of her life. Due to a crush that Emma had on a teacher of hers, [[Ian Kendall (Earth-616)|Ian Kendall]], Emma decided on a future in teaching, much to her father's disapproval. Being seen kissing Mr. Kendall in front of the Frost estate, Emma's father got Kendall fired and blackmailed Emma to give up her idea of teaching. After her brother's homosexuality was revealed to the family, her father [[Winston Frost (Earth-616)|Winston Frost]] began to alienate Christian, resulting in his further drug abuse and attempted suicide. When it came time for their father to choose a worthy heir to the family fortune, Christian was automatically dismissed due to his drug problem and because he was gay. While the older sister, [[Adrienne Frost (Earth-616)|Adrienne Frost]], seemed the most obvious choice, their father chose Emma. At the same time, Christian was sent to a mental institution, and Emma refused to be her father's heir, choosing to make her own way through life instead.{{r|{{cl|Emma Frost Vol 1 3}}-[[Emma Frost Vol 1 6|6]]}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 139}}

Emma began to work minimum wage jobs and stayed at a hotel in Boston. After attempting to use her telepathy to pay for the meal with a newspaper instead of money, Emma was eventually caught and made to wash dishes, where she met [[Troy Killkelly (Earth-616)|Troy Killkelly]], with whom she developed a relationship and moved in with. Unfortunately, Troy owed money and Emma used her telepathy at a casino to erase their financial problems, but the loan shark insisted that they owed more, for interest. Troy suggested that they pretend to kidnap Emma and have Winston pay a ransom, but Winston refused, stating that his daughter was already dead to him. After Troy was killed, Emma absorbed all of the shark's knowledge of business through her telepathy. After her sister Adrienne took Emma's kidnapping video to the news, Winston was forced to pay the ransom. However, Emma freed herself using her abilities, took the money, and moved to [[New York City|New York]].{{r|Emma Frost Vol 1 7|11}}

<!-- The point where Emma dyed her hair is shrouded in years of retcons and not so careful flashbacks. As such, this article considers Emma Frost Vol 1 as the point of reference, since it has the most organized continuity of Emma's past. -->
[[File:Emma Frost Vol 1 15 Textless.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Emma and Astrid]]
Emma escaped, dyed her hair blonde and enrolled into [[Empire State University]], where she was reunited with Mr. Kendall. While attending class, Emma met a fellow telepath, [[Astrid Bloom (Earth-616)|Astrid Bloom]], and Astrid began to train Emma in the use of her abilities. After learning that Mr. Kendall was dating her roommate, [[Christine McDermott (Earth-616)|Christine McDermott]], Emma confessed her love for him and he pursued a relationship with Emma. Christine threatened to expose Mr. Kendall's relationship with students if he did not leave Emma, but Astrid influenced him to choke her. Upon learning the truth, Emma telepathically fought and defeated Astrid, absorbing all her knowledge of telepathy, and thus saving Mr. Kendall's job, revealing her mutant powers to him in the end. Despite having saved his job, Mr. Kendall left Emma in disgust upon learning that she was a mutant.{{r|Emma Frost Vol 1 18}}

When Emma's parents found out about her powers, they sent her to a mental institution, the [[Essex Clinic]], where she was drugged. At some point during her stay there, she was kidnapped by the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] took her to [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], to use [[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebro]] and kill all humans, while bringing together all mutants. When the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] appeared, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] created a device that shut off access to the cosmic rays of the [[Evolutionaries]] and accidentally killed two of them. With [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] vowing to protect mutantkind, the remaining Evolutionary reluctantly left, but not before erasing the memory of their presence from the minds of everyone and vowing to return one day. After the Evolutionaries returned Emma to the clinic, her head was clear and the drugs were out of her system, so she influenced a guard to beat everyone up and escaped the clinic.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 24}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 48}}{{r|X-Men Vol 3 13|15}}

===The Hellfire Club beginnings===
Starving in New York City, Emma ended up as a stripper for the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]],{{r|X-Men Origins: Emma Frost Vol 1 1}} by making men see what they wanted to see.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 139}} There, she was contacted by Charles and Moira one more time to join a new team of X-Men. She was unable to recognize them, but she refused the offer once again, leading Professor X to erase her memory of the encounter, against [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]]'s judgment that Professor Xavier's doing was wrong and that he should've instead forcibly changed her mind.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 5}}

One day, tired of being mistreated, she finally snapped against [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]], an important member of the club, and threatened to kill him. To her surprise, he proceeded to invite her to rise in the ranks and rid the club of those who were a threat to mutants.{{r|X-Men Origins: Emma Frost Vol 1 1}} After Shaw chose Emma over two other women and brutally murdered them in front of her, their union was official.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 531}}

===The White Queen===
On the eve of becoming the Black King, Shaw discovered the current White King, [[Edward Buckman (Earth-616)|Edward Buckman]], and the White Queen, [[Paris Seville (Earth-616)|Paris Seville]], were creating Sentinels to hunt mutants down behind his back. After surviving an encounter with one of these machines, Emma returned to the club with Shaw and mind-controlled Buckman to kill everyone in the room, including his lover, Paris. To complete their take of power, Shaw strangled Buckman and became the Black King, alongside a new White Queen, Emma Frost.{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 7}}{{r|X-Men Origins: Emma Frost Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 129 001.jpg|thumb|Emma's first unshadowed appearance]]
Later, when Shaw was searching for a new White King, he threw a party to which he invited the most influential men in the world and tried to decide who was most fit for this position. Rejecting the candidacy of [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]], he chose [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Prince Namor]] of [[Atlantis]], and invited him to join the Club. But Namor contemptuously rejected the proposal, saying that if Sebastian ever again dared to waste his time with such a minor thing, he would kill him. This drove Shaw into a frenzy, so he ordered Emma to force Namor into the Club, no matter what the cost. A few days later, she acted out a suicide by jumping overboard from a yacht to attract Namor's attention. He rescued her and they spent two weeks together in [[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantis]]. Shaw, however, tired of waiting for news from Emma, and thinking that Namor had killed or captured her, decided to send Sentinels to her. Sentinels attacked Namor and Emma and caused damage to Atlantis, and Namor took this as a declaration of war. After finding that, despite the Sentinels' previous attacks, Shaw was the one that deployed these ones, Emma and Namor clashed with Shaw, [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Pierce]] and [[Sage (Earth-616)|Tessa]]. Tessa mind-wiped Emma to erase the memories of her betrayal and make her loyal to the Club again. Surrounded by two telepaths, Shaw explained to Namor that he would never get close enough to kill him. Namor left, but vowed to take revenge one day.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 2 2}}<ref>The issue depicts Selene as a telepath working for Shaw, but she wasn't part of the Hellfire Club back then. {{cl|Official Index to the Marvel Universe Vol 1 13}} corrects this by stating the character is, in fact, [[Sage (Earth-616)|Tessa]]</ref>

With the continuous growth of anti-mutant sentiment, Shaw believed his regular grunts were insufficient as guards and soldiers, so Emma convinced him to open a school and fulfill her lifelong dream. Thus was born the modern [[Massachusetts Academy]] in the [[Berkshire Mountains]] in [[Snow Valley]], [[Massachusetts (State)|Massachusetts]].{{r|X-Men Origins: Emma Frost Vol 1 1}} During this period, Emma also began a financial empire as the majority stockholder of a multi-billion dollar conglomerate, which was renamed [[Frost International (Earth-616)|Frost International]] after herself. Despite her youth, Emma became a chairperson of the board of Frost International and its CEO. Frost International was principally involved in transportation (both the building of ships and aircraft and their use for freight and passenger transport) and electronics.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 314}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 12}}
[[File:X-Force Vol 6 5 Dark Phoenix Saga 40th Anniversary Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]

Frost again encountered the X-Men when she attempted to recruit young mutant [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] for her school. The Hellfire Club had hired the mercenary, [[Mitchell Tanner (Earth-616)|Warhawk]], to battle the X-Men, while leaving a device that enabled the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club to monitor the activities of [[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebro]], a mutant-detecting machine Professor X built. Professor Xavier and Frost would each approach Pryde and her parents as the heads of private schools seeking to recruit her as a talented student. Neither Professor Xavier nor Emma intended to reveal to Kitty's parents that their daughter was a mutant. Emma left after making her pitch to [[Carmen Pryde (Earth-616)|Carmen]] and [[Theresa Pryde (Earth-616)|Theresa Pryde]], noting that whilst Carmen was in favor of her school, Theresa wasn't. As Emma was leaving Professor Xavier arrived accompanied by [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]]. While Kitty and the X-Men were at a malt shop, Frost ordered their capture and, while Kitty got away, Frost took the captured X-Men to Frost International. After Kitty phoned the rest of the X-Men, Emma was overpowered by the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] and believed dead.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 110}}{{r|X-Men Vol 1 129|131}}

[[File:Ororo Munroe (Earth-616) and Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 152 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Emma in control of Storm's body]]
Emma actually survived, but this incident left her in a coma for a month, during which time she had to rebuild her mind from inside out, managing to remember, among other things, the memory of Namor that Tessa had taken from her.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 131}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 2 2}}{{r|Dark Reign: The Cabal Vol 1 1}}

Later, Kitty's parents reconsidered allowing her to join Xavier's School and enrolled her in the Massachusetts Academy. Emma, now fully recovered, used that opportunity to switch bodies with Storm, who had driven Kitty there, while Shaw attacked the X-Men with a new type of [[Sentinel Mk IV (Earth-616)|Sentinels]]. After using Emma’s telepathy, Storm was able to gain her body back and the X-Men beat the Hellfire Club once again.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 151|152}}

===Clashing with the New Mutants===
At another time, while attempting to give Shaw an important message, Frost collapsed into catatonic schizophrenia and remained in a coma, due to [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Mastermind]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 169}}{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel Vol 1 4}} Emma eventually awoke from her coma and invited [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Doug Ramsey]] to her school, bringing her back into contact with Kitty.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 180}} After capturing Kitty and Doug, Emma was unaware that Kitty and [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] shared a rapport, and the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] came to their rescue. After having the New Mutants battle the [[Hellions (Earth-616)|Hellions]], Massachusetts superhero team, Kitty caused enough chaos for Magik to teleport them all away.{{r|{{cl|New Mutants Vol 1 15}}-[[New Mutants Vol 1 17|17]]}}
[[File:Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616), Sage (Earth-616) and Emma Frost (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 169 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Emma in coma]]

During the second Secret War, Emma was among the super-villains summoned by [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] to battle the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]].{{r|Secret Wars II Vol 1 7}}

While battling with the virtually omnipotent Beyonder, the New Mutants were killed, then removed from existence by the Beyonder and subsequently recreated by him. In being recreated, the New Mutants somehow lost much of the proficiency in using their superhuman powers that they had learned at Professor Xavier's school and became detached. Emma took advantage of this opportunity and offered Magneto her services with rehabilitating the children. Emma also had her student [[Manuel de la Rocha (Earth-616)|Empath]] affect Magneto's emotions of fears, insecurities, paranoia, and temperament, until he transferred all of the New Mutants, except [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Mirage]] and [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]], to the Massachusetts Academy.{{r|New Mutants #37|39}}

The New Mutants adjusted surprisingly well and Emma made a lot of progress in their mental therapy, however, upon realizing the manipulation, Magneto raced to get the children back, leading Emma to warn the authorities about an impending attack to her school from the Master of Magnetism. After the New Mutants left to rescue Magneto from the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] (unaware of Emma's call), Emma realized they still cared for their old teacher and moved them to neutral ground, where she worked together with Magneto to cure the children of their trauma at the hands of the Beyonder. In the end, they decided to return to Xavier's school, but remained thankful for all the help Frost had given them in their time of need.{{r|New Mutants #39|40}}

Emma encountered Magneto again, when an increase of mutant hostilities led Shaw to offer him a position in the Inner Circle, something which he was later talked into accepting by Storm, thus creating an alliance between the two rival schools.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 210}}{{r|New Mutants #51}}{{r|New Mutants #53|54}}

===Alliance with Magneto===
After the New Mutant, [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]], received a letter from her [[Lucius Aquilla (Earth-616)|father]], stating that she had learned enough from the outside world and it was time to return [[Nova Roma|home]] and marry, she fantasized about life among the Hellions, at the Massachusetts Academy.{{r|New Mutants #56}}

After hearing of an animal creature that was being mistreated after capture, Emma allowed the Hellions to participate in a contest with the New Mutants to abduct [[Bird-Brain (Earth-616)|Bird Brain]], where Magma and Empath revealed their mutual attraction to each other. After returning home victorious, Magma decided to return to the Massachusetts Academy. While picking-up Magma, Emma suggested that Magma was better suited for the Massachusetts Academy and that, since they were supposedly no longer rivals, Magneto could also eventually receive some of her students.{{r|New Mutants #56|57}}

As Magneto and Emma's relationship grew stronger, their relationship with the New Mutants and Shaw grew weaker. After Illyana reverted back to a little girl, Magneto's already strained alliance with Shaw, who believed Illyana was a valuable asset to the club, led to a physical confrontation between the two. With Magneto's victory, the two queens voted Shaw out of the Inner Circle and Magneto assumed the position as the only king of the club, dubbing himself the Grey King. Emma and Magneto then discussed how to get rid of [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]], then the Black Queen, but never had the chance to put their plan to motion.{{r|New Mutants #74|75}}

=== Reign's end ===
After an attempt on her life and other assaults against members of the Hellfire Club, Emma Frost informed the X-Men that the Inner Circle was under attack by [[Upstarts (Earth-616)|an unknown source]], one that could potentially become a threat to the X-Men as well.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 281}}
[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616) and Hellions (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 281 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Emma with her Hellions]]

As they met to discuss it, the time-travelling attacker known as [[Trevor Fitzroy (Earth-1191)|Trevor Fitzroy]] showed up and killed two of the Hellions. After an intense battle, later joined by a horde of Sentinels, Frost was plunged into yet another coma and most of the Hellions met their untimely demise. Frost's consciousness was apparently still active on the material plane and her body was kept in the Med-lab at the X-Men's mansion.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 281|284}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 310}} During her unconscious state, [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Dr. John Sublime]] harvested over 1000 eggs from her to begin experimentation.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 3}}

Almost a year later,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 316}} an accident caused Emma Frost to possess the body of the X-Man [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]]. Emma believed herself to be a prisoner of the X-Men and tried to escape, using Iceman's powers in unprecedented ways. When she discovered the fate of her Hellions, she broke down and began to realize that her training had been insufficient and that her students would likely have been better off with the Xavier.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 311|314}}

After having her mind returned to her body, Emma was held at the institute. When [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Sean Cassidy]] came home to Xavier’s school, his colleagues' weird behavior made him suspect something was wrong, and he soon realized the X-men had been replaced by the [[Phalanx (Race)|phalanx]]. After a fight with the [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] impostor, he freed [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]], who was also being held in the hopes of being rehabilitated, and threatened to explode his head if he didn't free Emma and [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]], who was unconscious in the Danger Room.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 316}}

[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616), Victor Creed (Earth-616) and Jubilation Lee (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 316 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|You probably didn't recognize her because of the green jumpsuit]]
Meanwhile, Sean discovered the Phalanx had uncovered Xavier's list of new mutants and were planning to capture them in order to learn how to assimilate mutants into their collective. Sean then proceeded to initiate the self-destruct sequence and, when Sabretooth and the others arrived, he screamed a pathway down to the sewers below. As the school exploded, destroying the Phalanx inside, Banshee informed his new allies of their mission to rescue the next generation of Homo superior.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 316}}

After saving the select group of teenage mutants and destroying Phalanx, Emma decided to start walking on a righteous path to atone for her past sins and, therefore, turned the Massachusetts Academy into the new '''Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters''', where she and Banshee would become the headmasters and where the rescued mutants would study as the new superhero team, Generation X.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #36|37}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 317|318}}

===Generation X===
Emma and Banshee had frequent disagreements about their teaching styles, but they cared about each other as well as their students.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 1}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 8|9}}{{r|X-Men Unlimited #16}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 25|26}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 30}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 45}}

[[File:Generation X Vol 1 24 Textless.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Back in white, with the women of Gen X]]
During the first semester, her younger sister, [[Cordelia Frost (Earth-616)|Cordelia]], tracked Emma down to ask for help in rescuing the mutant [[Mondo (Earth-616)|Mondo]], who had apparently been kidnapped by a man named Barrington. Emma immediately accused Cordelia of being up to something, but reluctantly agreed to assist her younger sister in finding Mondo. After successfully rescuing him with the help of her students, Emma, knowing her sister was a troublesome young lady, commanded Cordelia to stay away from the school.{{r|Generation X Annual #1995}}

Not long after, though, the [[Mondo (Clone) (Earth-616)|Mondo]] they'd rescued was revealed to be working for [[Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616)|Black Tom Cassidy]]. During the latter's attack on the school, he took control of Emma's body to hit Sean, hoping to force him to kill her. Knowing that Black Tom wouldn't stop until one of them was dead and that Sean couldn't bring himself to kill her, Emma took control of Sean's mind and sent a powerful sonic scream in her direction, apparently ending her life.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 25}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 61}}

After [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Penance]] defeated Black Tom, Sean mourned Emma while looking for the missing students. After countless failed attempts, Sean was starting to get desperate, but Emma appeared from behind and jumped into his arms, revealing she had forced him to use the specific frequency that would simply stun her for an hour.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 26}}

After a joyful reunion, they were approached by [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]], who offered the kids' location in exchange for Penance. Sean immediately turned the offer down, but Emma contacted him telepathically to convince him of trying to trick Emplate. Sean still thought it was too much of a risk however, so Emma had to knock him out and try to proceed with the deal by herself. Yet, before handing over their ward, Banshee woke up and rescued Penance, before fleeing with her.{{r|{{cl|Generation X Vol 1 26}}-[[Generation X Vol 1 31|31]]}}

It all turned out fine in the end, as all the kids made their way back to the school, but it took some time for Sean and Emma to see eye to eye again.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 32|34}}

When everything was finally going well, Emma received a call from her financial planner with the news that her company had just taken a major hit on the stock market, placing the school in financial jeopardy. To fix this issue, she was initially thinking of simply telepathically motivating more investors, but Banshee convinced her to set an example for the students by not taking the easy way out. Thus, she risked humiliation by asking her older sister for help.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 48}}

Adrienne was not keen on financially rescuing her sister, who she'd always been jealous of, but after discovering the students were secretly mutants, she decided to help Emma with the condition of becoming co-headmistress.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 48}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 70}}

[[File:Adrienne Frost (Earth-616) from Generation X Vol 1 75 0001.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Death in the family]]
For a few weeks, Adrienne hid her true intentions; until one night, she kidnapped Generation X and locked them in a mind prison disguised as a retelling of the events that led to the Hellions' deaths. After the team and Emma released themselves, Adrienne revealed she had planned for the kids to die solely to see Emma suffer while standing powerless to save her students again. She then pronounced herself as the new White Queen and made her exit with a teleportation device.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 55|56}}

After countless adventures, a bold revenge plan by Adrienne ended in [[Everett Thomas (Earth-616)|Synch]]'s death and Emma murdering her sister, which, once discovered, shook the team's trust in their Headmistress and led to the ultimate closure of the Massachusetts Academy. Despite being the murderer, she got hold of her sister's possessions and moved to [[Genosha]], where she tried teaching a new class. Not long afterwards, however, she experienced tragedy again as she became one of the only survivors of a Sentinel attack by manifesting a [[Secondary Mutation]]: the ability to transform her body into unbreakable diamond.{{r|{{cl|Generation X Vol 1 67}}-[[Generation X Vol 1 75|75]]}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 115|116}}

===Joining the X-Men===
Still recovering from the massacre, Emma once again returned to the Xavier Institute to teach, and immediately took the quintuplet psychic sisters, the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]], under her wing.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 116|118}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 120}}

One of her first chances to prove herself and save the school came when Xavier's sister, [[Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-616)|Cassandra Nova]], took over his body and was planning to eliminate all mutants in the world. After he claimed his body back, leaving Cassandra non-corporeal, Emma convinced her that she had brought Cassandra's body to her in exchange for her life and that of the Cuckoos, but in reality Cassandra was tricked into being trapped inside the alien [[Stuff (Earth-616)|Stuff]], that had been programmed to keep her contained.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 126}}

Still resented by most at school, Emma did strike up a friendship with Beast and developed an attraction for Cyclops. During a riot at the school by [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]] and his [[Omega Gang (Earth-616)|Omega Gang]], the Cuckoo [[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]] died while using the drug [[Kick]] and [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]] to subdue Quentin. Blaming Emma's emphasis on heroism for Sophie's death, the Cuckoos abandoned her.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 127|138}}

[[File:New X-Men Vol 1 156 Textless.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Emma and Scott lovingly hug]]
Meanwhile, with a void growing between Scott Summers and [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], Emma offered telepathic counseling that then grew into a psychic affair. The Cuckoos took out their anger toward Emma by tipping off Jean. When Jean discovered the two together on the astral plane she brutally tore through Emma's memories, forcing her to remember all the things she'd repressed in her past, including her failure to keep the Hellions alive. Breaking down, Emma admitted to [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] that her attraction towards Scott had grown into genuine love.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 138|139}}

Shortly after her affair with Cyclops had come to light, Emma was seemingly assassinated, shot with a bullet in her weak spot while in diamond form, causing her to shatter. Beast desperately began searching for her pieces in an effort to put her together, while [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] and [[Sage (Earth-616)|Sage]] were brought in to find the killer. Emma's former protege [[Esme Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Esme]] was guilty, but she left the school to avoid punishment. Emma, in turn, was put back together and restored to life by Jean.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 139|141}}

During an incident with [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]], who took over Manhattan while posing as Magneto, both Jean and Esme were killed and the mansion was destroyed. After the events, Professor Xavier decided to leave the X-Men for some time on his own, and Emma attempted to convince Cyclops to rebuild the school with her. Despite his intense feelings of guilt, Cyclops agreed, due to being prodded by Jean herself, who had ascended to the [[White Hot Room]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 154}}

===Headmistress Once Again===
After rebuilding and re-opening the school, Emma took the position as one of two co-headmasters of the school, alongside Cyclops, and also began tutoring a group of students, the [[Hellions Squad (Earth-616)|Hellions Squad]], as part of the new policy of breaking the students up into smaller teams. She also continued serving as an active X-Man, lending her services to several X-Men teams.{{r|{{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 1}}-[[New X-Men Vol 2 2|2]]}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 452}}{{r|Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 9}}

[[File:New X-Men Hellions Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Hellions Squad]]
However, Emma continued to be distrusted by her fellow X-Men due to her villainous past, but now even more so due to the perception that she had "usurped" Jean's place in the group by becoming Cyclops' lover and co-headmistress. While some, such as Wolverine, Beast and Cyclops trusted Emma, others such as Kitty Pryde, Dani Moonstar and [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Grey]] were initially dismissive and distrusting of her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 444}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 452}}{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 1}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 3}}{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 2 11}}

Despite this sentiment from certain faculty members, Emma had a great relationship with her students and, unlike the other advisors, she would allow the alumni to pick their own codenames. Emma yearned to show indifference in front of Dani, and appeared to dismiss all her complains, but in reality she cared deeply for her students' welfare and often found unique ways to bond with them and correct them.{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 10}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 1|6}}{{r|Marvel Holiday Special 2004 Vol 1 1}}

===The Phoenix===
[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616) from X-Men Phoenix Endsong Vol 1 4 001.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Emma with the Phoenix Force]]
When the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]], forced to return to life prematurely, came to Earth to use Cyclops' powers to replenish itself, Emma and the X-Men tried to stop it. As part of a desperate plan, Emma convinced the Phoenix to possess her, briefly making her a host of the Phoenix Force. A resurrected Jean Grey forced the Phoenix to leave Emma, and the X-Men were able to diffuse the situation by projecting all the X-Men's feelings of love towards Jean directly into her mind, preventing her from losing control and becoming Dark Phoenix.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Endsong Vol 1 4|5}}

===House of M===
In the [[Earth-58163|House of M]] reality, created by the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] by making every hero's most desired wishes come true, Emma was married to Cyclops and worked as a child psychologist.{{r|House of M Vol 1 2}}{{r|Secrets of the House of M Vol 1 1}} After Wolverine realized something was wrong, Emma was the first X-Man he contacted for help. With the help of other "awakened" heroes, they commenced an assault on Magneto's Genoshan headquarters and tried to find the missing Professor Xavier. Emma was the only one to side with Wolverine on the controversial opinion to kill the Scarlet Witch, but they didn't get the chance, as Wanda got angry at how her mutant heritage and her father's choices had ruined her family and decided to restore reality as it were, with the exception that 90% of mutants worldwide lost their powers. After what came to be known as [[Decimation|M-Day]], Emma was among the relatively few mutants to retain her powers.{{r|House of M Vol 1 6|8}}

Not long afterwards, however, Emma's world would change even more. After following the Stepford Sisters to [[The World]], Emma Frost finally learned the origin of the Cuckoos: they were her daughters, bred from her eggs alongside hundreds of others, harvested by Sublime years before.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 5|5]]}}

===The New Hellfire Club===
Later, the question of Emma's "true loyalties" was brought into focus again, as Emma abandoned the team during a fight to confer with a shadowy figure, revealed to be one of a group of four individuals watching from the shadows. The group consisted of Sebastian Shaw, [[Ellie Phimister (Earth-616)|Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] (a girl who had apparently died in Genosha), Cassandra Nova and a cloaked figure called Perfection, who discussed among themselves Emma's impending betrayal of the team.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 12}}

[[File:Hellfire Club (Earth-616) from Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 12 0001.jpg|thumb|180px|left|New Hellfire Club]]
In reality, Emma Frost's trick on Cassandra Nova months before had created nefarious consequences: Cassandra had implanted a mental suggestion into Emma's mind, creating a delusion wherein she believed that she had only joined the X-Men to free Cassandra. The "new Hellfire Club" was, in fact, no more than a mental projection created by Emma. Under Cassandra's influence, Frost telepathically tormented the X-Men with a series of illusions and coerced Kitty into freeing Cassandra, but, before she could break free from Stuff's body, [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] director [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]] abducted the X-Men to her spaceship, where Frost was out of Cassandra Nova's reach.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 13|18}}

Brand, in need of super-heroes, explained that [[Kruun (Earth-616)|Lord Kruun]], the leader of [[Breakworld]], intended to eliminate Earth due to a prophecy that claimed Colossus would destroy Breakworld. Upon reaching the planet, the X-Men were relentlessly attacked, being scattered all over the alien planet. [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]], the physical manifestation of the [[Danger Room]]'s software, had also been brought by Brand and attacked Cyclops and Frost. Frost managed to convince Danger to aid the X-Men, while Beast and Brand learned Kruun had a gigantic missile aimed at Earth. Cyclops, Wolverine and [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]] deceived Kruun's forces by being intentionally captured. With Kruun accounted for, Kitty phased into the missile in order to disable it, only to discover it was actually a giant bullet, which was ultimately fired at Earth with Kitty trapped inside.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 19|24}} On Breakworld, the X-Men learned that the prophecy had been fabricated by [[Aghanne (Earth-616)|Aghanne]] to attract Colossus, who was the only one in the Universe capable of reaching the core of the planet's power source and cause a chain reaction that would destroy her world, which she despised. She was ultimately killed by her own rage, failing to destroy Breakworld, but the bullet was already on its way to the Solar System and the heroes on Earth were failing to stop it. At the last moment, Kitty Pryde used her powers to phase the entire bullet through Earth, effectively preventing the planet's destruction. However, with no obstacles to oppose it, the bullet kept moving in a straight line, leaving Kitty to forever wander through outer space.{{r|Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men Vol 1 1}}

===San Francisco===
During a vacation in the Savage Land, Emma and Scott were called to San Francisco when [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Warren]] realized someone was telepathically making everyone think they were in the 1960s. Emma was able to break through the mental barriers and expose [[Martinique Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Martinique]], but she escaped before they could get to her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 495|499}} The X-Men and any remaining mutants came to San Francisco, where the [[Sadie Sinclair (Earth-616)|mayor]] had offered them refuge, ignoring the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Fifty State Initiative]]. Emma called every "X-Man" (any powered and depowered mutants, friends or foes) in the world using her telepathy, to ask them to rally in SF.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 500}}
[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616) and Scott Summers (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 497 cover.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Emma and Scott mingled in Martinique's illusion]]

When Xavier attempted to warn Cyclops about his recent encounter with Sinister, Frost managed to enter the Professor's mind undetected. During the course of their encounter, Frost forced Xavier to relive each of his mistakes and morally ambiguous decisions made under altruistic pretenses. It was also revealed that while Frost was just as angry with Xavier as Cyclops was, she also wanted to help him move on with his life. Frost pointed the Professor in a new direction by forcing him to relive the supposed death of Moira MacTaggert and reminding him of her last words.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #215|216}}

Emma fought the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] in San Francisco during the invasion. There, the Skrulls set up a telepathy-blocking "wall" throughout the globe. Emma channeled the Cuckoos' telepathy into her own using Cerebra in an attempt to locate the source of the psi-blockade but was left comatose. The Cuckoos told Cyclops that Emma was dead, unaware that Emma's telepathic mind was continuing to battle the psychic team of Skrulls. Setting a series of traps through misdirection, Emma managed to break free and shut down the psi-blockade.{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men Vol 1 1|3}}

===Dark Reign===
After [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] was appointed as the [[United States Of America|USA]]'s top cop, he immediately convened a group of supposedly like-minded individuals (later dubbed the [[Cabal (Dark Illuminati) (Earth-616)|Cabal]]) to consolidate his grip on power. After some advice from Storm, Emma joined the group consisting of Norman, Namor, [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] and the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]].{{r|Secret Invasion #8}}{{r|Secret Invasion: Dark Reign #1}}
[[File:Dark Reign The Cabal Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|185px|thumb|left|With the Cabal]]

Following a series of pro versus anti-mutant protests and riots instigated by [[Simon Trask (Earth-616)|Simon Trask]] in San Francisco, Emma was asked by Norman Osborn to lead a civil peacekeeping group of [[X-Men (Osborn) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] sanctioned by himself. Emma accepted but decided to add Namor to the roster, as they had recently become close allies.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 2 2}}{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 513}}

Emma's first mission with the team occurred when she arrested a group of mutant vandals led by her own former star student, [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]]. Even at that early stage, there was already tension between teammates, particularly when [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]] (a member of Osborn's X-Men) almost perpetrated a lethal attack on a mutant rioter. Emma prevented any fatalities, however, and the prisoners were brought in.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 7}}

While tensions rose between the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]] and the new X-Men team, enhanced by the aggression of Daken and [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], Emma put emphasis on the fact that she would only continue to be a party to this strategy of Osborn's if all the mutants were treated humanely, insisting on touring the facility to see how the prisoners were being treated. She was then contacted by Professor X, who informed her that he and Hank were being kept prisoner there. He also told her that the Omega Chair developed by the Dark Beast had horrible side effects and that Osborn wasn't telling her everything. Emma then discovered that the presence of Hank and Professor X was being kept secret from her using hologram projectors. Remaining in her diamond form for protection, and unable to speak telepathically, she verbally reassured the Professor that she believed him and that she would make sure everything would be all right.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 7}}

[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616) from Dark Avengers Uncanny X-Men Utopia Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|180px|thumb|right|as the Black Queen]]
Over the next several days, she then took her team of X-Men around San Francisco, not only stopping Trask and his human-conversion bio sentinels, but also clearing up the residual riots and rounding up the remaining mutants from the streets. Her motives came into even greater doubt when she and Namor stood idly by when Dark Beast was using his Omega Machine to torture and power drain the captives, while [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] and [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] could barely look on.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 8}}

However, Emma's true motivations and interests behind her recent actions were revealed when, after another session draining Henry McCoy with the Omega Machine, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-295)|Dark Beast]] and [[Michael Pointer (Earth-616)|Weapon Omega]] discovered that all the mutant captives had disappeared. [[Irma Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Mindee]] had allowed herself to get arrested so she could lead [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] there, using Magik's portals. After being notified, Emma led Osborn's X-Men to stop X-Force, then surprised everyone by betraying her own team. Daken and [[Calvin Rankin (Earth-616)|Mimic]] were taken down in the process, while Cloak, Dagger and Namor went with her and X-Force to rejoin the rest of the mutants on a mobile island/vessel, reminiscent of Magneto's [[Asteroid M]], which had been dubbed [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]].{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 8}}

With his Cabal crippled due to the loss of two key members, an enraged Osborn ordered the Dark Avengers and remaining Dark X-Men to bring him "Namor's head" and "Frost's heart". While Cyclops' X-Men battled Norman's teams, Emma telepathically accessed the "white room" she had stored in the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]]'s mind, so that she could contain the [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|Void]] while he made his escape. Unfortunately, the Void proved too strong for Emma and broke free, chasing after the Sentry. Worse, a small sliver of the Void was trapped in her forehead, forcing Emma to remain in diamond form so it wouldn't control her and access her telepathic abilities. In the meantime, the X-Men outnumbered Osborn's Avengers and X-Men, forcing them back.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 8}}{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Exodus Vol 1 1}}

===Stuck in Diamond Form===
Though free from Osborn, a new menace soon arrived in the form of Selene. Frost, in particular, was targeted for attempting to betray her years before. Additionally, Selene was also angry over her using the Black Queen moniker when she was leading the Dark X-Men. Using the techno-organic virus, Selene managed to resurrect countless dead mutants, including Emma's old students, the Hellions, who she sent to Utopia to attack and taunt Frost. Their appearance was enough to leave Frost in a horrified state of shock, but Scott stepped in and kept her safe in this low moment.{{r|X-Necrosha Vol 1 1}} Once Selene's inner circle appeared on Utopia, Frost stopped Wolverine from killing her former student [[Kevin Ford (Earth-616)|Wither]]. However, after Selene's inner circle succeeded in capturing [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]], leaving a great deal of carnage behind, Frost recognized that the threat would not end until Selene and her inner circle were permanently stopped. Thus, she ordered X-Force to travel to Necrosha and kill them all, even Wither.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 21|22}}
[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 515 001.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Containing Void]]

After things calmed down, the time came to remove the Void sliver from Emma, given that the X-Men needed a telepath in place of the Stepford Cuckoos, who were rendered unconscious when the Phoenix fragments escaped from their bodies. Cyclops attempted to go into her mind to extract the sliver. Unfortunately, the Void changed tactics and attempted to take control of him. Luckily, Cyclops was able to seal the Void within the black box in his mind,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 517|519}} where he previously kept tactical secrets that could result in innocent deaths.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 504}}{{r|Dark X-Men: The Confession Vol 1 1}}

===Dealing with Shaw===
[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 529 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|180px]]
After having convinced Namor that she'd killed Shaw for crimes against mutantkind,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 2 2}} Emma was growing worried that Namor would find out he was actually being held in Utopia's [[Cell Block X|Brig]]. When Emma was acting as a psi-link between Colossus and a newly-returned Kitty Pryde, who was stuck in her intangible form and unable to speak, Pryde sensed a "leaking thought" of Emma's desire to finally get rid of Shaw, and insisted on helping her deal with the issue. Kitty got a special suit from [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]] to cancel out her intangibility and accompanied Emma and Fantomex to [[China]] to make sure they wouldn't kill him. There, Shaw broke free and tried to kill Emma. After multiple failed attempts at subduing the Black King, Emma made him think he'd managed to kill her, which gave her enough to break through his mental blocks and wipe his memory clean. After that, they left him there to live his life away from them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 527|534}}

===Last days of Utopia===
During the [[Fear Itself|Serpent's Invasion]], San Francisco was strangely spared for a time. Namor tried to seduce Emma once more but she refused him; however, Namor taunted her about her romantic relationship with Cyclops, saying that "he married the redhead". This allowed the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]]'s worldwide fear effect into Emma's mind, heightening her insecurities. She was nearly compelled to kill Hope, who was hospitalized after fighting the Serpent's agent [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]], but Namor snapped Emma out of her trance.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 540|543}}

After the super-sentinel attack on Utopia, Emma considered going with Wolverine to the school in order to pursue her love of teaching. Cyclops begged her to stay however and she relented. She then joined the [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|Extinction Team]]. On their first big mission against a resurrected Mister Sinister, she lost her arm in diamond form, forcing her to stay that way until it was reattached.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 #1}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 #3|3]]}}

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
Emma Frost sided with her fellow X-Men against the Avengers. She took Hope away, deeper into Utopia to keep her safe and joined the fight, which began when Cyclops blasted [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] with his optic power. During the battle, Emma's telepathic abilities were blocked by a nanocloud created by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], forcing her to rely on her diamond form. After the Avengers appeared to have won the battle of Utopia after Cyclops surrendered, it was revealed to be a ruse allowing Cyclops, Emma and several other mutants to escape and begin the search for Hope, who had left Utopia after defeating the [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]], Wolverine and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 2}}

Next, Emma and Cyclops went to the Jean Grey School in order to recruit people to their side. A brief fight broke out between Cyclops's Extinction Team and Wolverine's X-Men. After Wolverine was approached by Hope and betrayed her location to Captain America, Emma used her telepathy to find out where Hope was; and together with Colossus, Namor, Magik and Cyclops, she journeyed to the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]] in order to stop the Avengers from getting her. Before a battle could break out, the two teams were interrupted by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] who fell from the skies badly injured. He was swiftly followed by the Phoenix.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 3|4}}

[[File:Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 6 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Phoenix Five]]
A fight broke out between the X-Men and the Avengers as the Phoenix was making Hope into its new host; while Iron Man built a weapon to fight the Phoenix. Iron Man attacked the Phoenix but instead of destroying it, the Phoenix turned Emma, Cyclops, Magik, Colossus and Namor into avatars. Cyclops and the rest of the avatars took Hope back to Earth in order to prepare her.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 5}}

The Phoenix five destroyed almost all Sentinels on Earth, Emma went to the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]] to destroy [[Juston Seyfert (Earth-616)|Juston Seyfert]]'s [[Sentinel (Juston) (Earth-616)|Sentinel]] even if its programming preventing it from hurting mutants. After seeing that Juston saw the Sentinel as a friend the other members of the Academy tried to help him only to be defeated by the incredible power of Phoenix. Once Emma destroyed the Sentinel and left the place, Pietro revealed that he saved the control unit, so they could rebuild it.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 32|33}}

Emma and her fellow Phoenixes began using their powers to make the world a better place by eliminating wars and providing water, food and energy to the entire world for free. The Avengers continued to oppose them however and kidnapped Hope, causing Cyclops to declare "No more Avengers".{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 6}} The Phoenixes fought the Avengers whenever they showed up and captured many of their number. Cyclops insisted on not using lethal force however. Emma found out the Avengers were hiding in [[Wakanda]] and told this to her fellow Phoenix Namor, but neglected to mention it to anyone else. Namor stormed Wakanda,{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 7}} but was narrowly defeated by the Avengers.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 8}} 

[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616) from Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 6 001.jpg|thumb|right|180px|As a Phoenix Avatar]]
After receiving Namor's portion of the Phoenix, Emma's power increased and she found out where the Avengers had taken Hope. The increased power also became more than she could handle and she began worrying over what she would do next. With her increased telepathic powers, she was able to know the secrets of everyone in the world and began losing control of herself by killing people who had harmed mutants (like a pilot who accidentally killed a young mutant and neglected to report it). When Colossus and Magik fought each other and knocked each other out, their portions of the Phoenix went to Emma and Cyclops.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 9}} Emma began exerting her dominance over the X-Men, threatening those that had thoughts that displeased her. Magneto attempted to reason with her but Emma refused to listen and threatened him. After being defeated by Hope, Cyclops realized that he needed more power and traveled to Utopia to find Emma.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 10}} 

Cyclops could not find himself to take the Phoenix from Emma, despite some taunting on her part. She tested Scott by tempting him to burn the entire world and start again from nothing, but Cyclops refused. Their conversation was interrupted when they were attacked by the combined might of the Avengers and the X-Men. Professor X used his telepathy to try and shut them down long enough for the Avengers and X-Men to take them down. Cyclops finally gave in and brutally took Emma's portion of the Phoenix, becoming the sole wielder of the Phoenix Force. After Xavier tried to shut him down again, Scott killed him and completely lost control of himself, becoming the Dark Phoenix.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 11}} Emma was then taken into custody by the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 30}}

===Mutant Revolution===
Shortly after, Emma was freed by Cyclops and Magneto as she was being transferred, but both her rescuers realized they were no longer in full control of their powers. While she was grateful for the spring, she was still furious at Cyclops and wanted to get as far away from him as she could, even revealing that she could no longer read people's minds, and that anyone touched by the Phoenix had their powers altered in some way. After a moment of deliberation and realizing more police were on their way, Emma agreed to join with Scott and Magneto once more and, along with Magik, began searching for new mutants.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 3}}

Emma was present during several of Cyclops' skirmishes in freeing several Mutants from their human captors, but was not present for the meeting with the original five [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|X-Men]], displaced in time, and was displeased to hear of Jean Grey once more among the living and running around in their time. {{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 4}}

[[File:X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 4 5 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Emma and the revolutionary X-Men]]
During a mission to [[San Diego]], Emma, along with the rest of her team, donned new outfits, sporting a completely black wardrobe this time around, in the same vein as her teammates. She poked fun at Magneto being unable to control metal as he used to when battling the Sentinels, but Cyclops saved the day during a counterattack. She was also in utter shock at seeing what level of destruction the alterations to his powers created in its wake.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 1}}

Emma later accused Tony Stark of being responsible for the Phoenix Five's creation,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 3}} convinced Scott to go along with Magneto's double agent status, recruited time-displaced Angel and the Stepford Cuckoos,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 4}} fought the forces of [[Limbo (Otherplace)|Limbo]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 6}} and assisted in teaching [[Benjamin Deeds (Earth-616)|Benjamin Deeds]] how to use his powers cleverly.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 14}} When Irma Cuckoo dyed her hair, she supported her daughter's desire to be different, in contrast to [[Celeste Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Celeste]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 6}}

Her telepathic powers later returned through unknown means shortly before Cyclops disbanded his school.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 32}}

===The Terrigen Crisis===
When Emma Frost and the X-Men received a distress call from [[Muir Island]], they discovered the clouds formed by the [[Terrigen Mist]] released into the atmosphere by the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] king [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] were toxic to mutants and one of them had swept over the island and killed everyone there. While investigating the facility, Cyclops was almost instantaneously affected by the mists and died. Struck by grief, Emma resolved to give Cyclops a more fitting death and created a mental projection of him. Using this mental projection, she put together a plot to destroy the Terrigen Clouds. She was successful in destroying one of them, but was confronted by the Inhumans. As part of her plan to turn Cyclops into a martyr, Emma had the mental projection confront Black Bolt, and "die" by his hand. Storm managed to negotiate a truce with the Inhumans, allowing Emma to keep her life and freedom, and the X-Men gave Cyclops a hero's burial. Emma kept the secret of Cyclops' death to herself, only telling [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], who had refused to believe that his brother would choose to die under such circumstances.{{r|{{cl|Death of X #1}}-[[Death of X #4|4]]}}

[[File:IVX Vol 1 6 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
When the X-Men discovered the remaining Terrigen Cloud was weeks from reaching a saturation point, which would've caused it to become assimilated with the atmosphere and render the Earth uninhabitable for mutants, Emma Frost incited the X-Men to take action wage war against the Inhumans to keep them occupied until they could destroy the cloud.{{r|IVX Vol 1 1}} Despite the X-Men's initial hostility, the Inhuman queen [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] agreed to destroy the Terrigen Cloud after learning what was at stake. Even though the X-Men had achieved their goal, Emma tried to continue riling them up since she blamed them for Scott's death. When the truth of Cyclops' death came to light, Emma unveiled a series of Sentinels she had constructed specifically to target Inhumans, prompting both factions to join forces against her. Emma was eventually defeated, but Havok stepped in to save her and teleported away with her, revealing that saving her is what he felt he owed Cyclops.{{r|IVX Vol 1 6}}

===New Tian and Mothervine===
In preparation for his conquest of the United States, an [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|evil doppelganger]] of Steve Rogers that had impersonated the real Captain America decided to neutralize possible mutant interference by granting them a sovereign land in the western United States, with the only condition being that no mutant would be able to step foot on America.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 17}} He appointed Emma Frost as the ruler of the mutant nation, [[New Tian]], though she telepathically controlled [[Shen Xorn (Earth-616)|Shen Xorn]] to use him as a puppet ruler, which allowed her to rule the country from behind the scenes.{{r|Secret Empire: United Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616) from X-Men Blue Vol 1 7 001.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Back in White]]
During the final days of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s rule, Captain America invaded Wakanda in the search for one of the many [[Cosmic Cube]] fragments randomly scattered throughout the world. Since one of these fragments had fallen in her hands, Emma approached Steve with it in an attempt to appease Hydra. However, Rogers rebuffed her once he obtained the shard. With any pretense of peace shattered, the mutants entered the final battle against Hydra in [[Washington, D.C.]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}} Following the liberation of the United States, the territory of New Tian was taken back by the country.{{r|Secret Empire Omega Vol 1 1}}

During the country's brief existence, New Tian was used as an experimental ground for the [[Mothervine]] virus in preparation for the further plans of a cabal formed by Emma, Havok, [[Claudine Renko (Earth-616)|Miss Sinister]] and [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]]. Emma's most loyal subjects were granted enhancements to their abilities using Mothervine, giving Miss Sinister enough raw material to test her findings before taking Mothervine to a global level.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 9}} A global release of Mothervine would've quadrupled the number of mutants almost instantaneously, and would've made mutantkind the dominant species in less than a year.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 23}}

By the time that Mothervine's release had reached global levels and several bombs were launched towards major cities, Emma learned that people affected by it could have their will subjugated. When Magneto's X-Men were captured by Miss Sinister after a failed assault against the cabal,{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 27}} Emma Frost finally turned against her. In the meantime, Magneto had enlisted [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]]'s help to purge Mothervine from its impact zones. Emma Frost and the freed X-Men confronted Havok and Bastion and defeated them. Emma also helped [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] tap into Havok's psyche to reverse the effects of an inversion spell cast during [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]] that had inverted his personality. Following the destruction of Mothervine at its source, Emma even contacted Magneto in an attempt to come to an understanding and put their differences behind them, but to no avail.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 28}}

After her venture with the young X-Men, Emma learned that her brother Christian had been released from the institution he'd been put in by their father years before. She traveled her parents' house to check on her brother, but was prevented from doing so by her father and his new-found powers. Seeing no choice but to get some back-up, Emma reached out to Bobby Drake to ask for his assistance, and, despite some initial reluctance, Bobby agreed to accompany Emma back to her parents'. Once there, they found her father dead and discovered Christian was the one that had developed mutant powers, having created a projection of their father. After using Bobby's mind to calm Christian down, Emma decided to take over Frost Technologies and work with Christian to regain control.{{r|Iceman Vol 4 2}}

===Nation of Krakoa===
Emma Frost was later tasked by Charles Xavier and Magneto to oversee the international trade relations of the new nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. As both the White Queen of the Hellfire Trading Company and a chief ambassador of Krakoa, Emma was given a seat on the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council]], Krakoa's first governing body, in return for exporting its miracle drugs to the rest of the world. The Hellfire Corporation was also awarded a second seat on the Council for the Black King, Sebastian Shaw, in order to ensure he'd handle the black market trade with countries that rejected their sovereignty. As her final demand, Emma asked for a third seat for a person of her choosing.{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 5}} 

[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616) from House of X Vol 1 6 002.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
When the Quiet Council's initial gathering took place, Emma was present among the other members. Their first order of business was two-pronged: draft the basic tenets of the new mutant society and pass judgment on mutant criminal Sabretooth. After the Council agreed upon the tenet that no mutant would be allowed to take a human life, Creed threatened all present with death, believing they would make an example of him via execution. Emma and Jean Grey then used their telepathy to harshly silence his threats, leaving Creed a drooling mess. After drafting three official basic tenets for the fledgling nation, the Council found Creed unanimously beyond redemption and sentenced him to "stasis... deep inside Krakoa. Alive but immobile... aware but unable to act on it..." Following their deliberation, Emma and the rest of the Council joined in the festivities taking place on the island, celebrating the recognition of Krakoa as a sovereign nation. Emma and Jean seemed to have finally buried the proverbial hatchet over their rivalry, even sharing a couple of beers over the fireworks.{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}}

After the celebrations were over, Emma put her past conflicts behind her and offered her extra seat on the council to Kate Pryde, as well as the title of Red Queen.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 3}} However, this became an obstacle for Sebastian Shaw, who planned to eventually regain absolute control of the club.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 3}} By pulling the necessary strings, he got the anti-mutant group [[Homines Verendi (Earth-616)|Homines Verendi]] to attack his son [[Shinobi Shaw (Earth-616)|Shinobi]] in order to lure Kate out. Then, finding her alone, he immobilized [[Lockheed (Earth-616)|Lockheed]] and released Krakoan seeds that wrapped around Kate, negating her powers. Believing she couldn't be revived, he sank her into the water and effectively made her drown to death. Although, due to his ego, he forgot to confirm if Lockheed had really been eliminated.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 6|7}}

Initially, the Five were indeed unable to create a clone body for Kate, despite multiple attempts at the behest of Xavier. Fortunately, after Kate's funeral, Lockheed made its way to Emma, who was grieving in pain. When she read the dragon's mind and realized Shaw was responsible, she decided to ask for another revival attempt. At the eighteenth attempt, Kate was finally brought back as Emma had realized that, unlike other mutants, Kate had to phase through her cocoon rather than break out of it. Before getting to her welcoming party, Emma shared with Kate what Lockheed had witnessed, and she immediately came up with a plan to act her revenge, which Emma loved.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 10|12}}

[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616) and Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616) from Marauders Vol 1 16 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]
They let the contest with [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]] pass and then decided to execute the plan. They invaded Shaw's house, at [[Blackstone (Krakoa)|Blackstone]], and began by neutralizing his powers, so they could punch him without holding back. While Emma poured herself a drink and relaxed, Kate unleashed everything she had on Shaw and, when she was done, Storm arrived with Lockheed, who bit off Shaw's eye and threw it in the fireplace. To finish their glorious revenge, they served him a poisoned drink that left him crippled and unable to walk, but still capable of listening to them and understanding how he'd lost everything he'd hoped to achieve.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 16}}

Once that problem was dealt with, Emma focused her attention on making the final arrangements for the [[Hellfire Gala]]{{r|Marauders Vol 1 17}} that she had been planning for a while.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 7}}{{r|Giant-Size X-Men: Magneto Vol 1 1}}

===Inferno===
Following the gala, [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] bribed Emma with a mysterious black box that she'd been trying to procure for some time. In return, she requested Emma's support in an upcoming vote on the Quiet Council. When the time came, Emma had to reluctantly vote in favor of a newly-resurrected [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny]] to take over [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]]'s chair, surprising everyone in the room. Later, she met with Xavier, Magneto, and [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggert]], who she was shocked to learn was not only alive, but a fellow mutant. As Moira told her to read her mind, Emma learned of her role in the creation of Krakoa and the multiple lives she had lived before this one. Disgusted that Xavier and Magneto had been lying to everyone for so long, she left without letting them explain, assuring them that she wouldn't take Destiny's presence lightly, but that they'd lost her loyalty forever. In spite of this, at the next council meeting, she still supported their suggestion for [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] to take over Jean’s seat.{{r|Inferno Vol 2 2}}

<big>'''[[Secondary Mutation]]'''</big>

'''Organic Diamond Form:''' As a result of undergoing a body-wide [[Secondary Mutation]]{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 116}}, Frost possesses the ability to transform her body into a flexible organic diamond form. In many ways, this is similar to [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]]' organic steel form. She must transform all parts of her body, rather than selectively transforming certain areas and can remain in this form for an undetermined amount of time. If she is rendered unconscious, Frost's body will automatically transform into its normal state. This transformation also alters Frost's personality, causing her to become rather cold-hearted and to lose her empathy for others. Emma does not have access to her telepathy while in her diamond form,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 534}} although she could during her first time after her Secondary Mutation.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 116}}

*'''''Superhuman Stamina:''''' While transformed, her muscles produce almost no fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting her almost limitless superhuman stamina, or at least until or unless she is forced to resume her normal state.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 4}}
*'''''Superhuman Durability:''''' Frost's diamond form renders her highly resistant to most forms of physical injury. She is able to resist great impact forces, such as being repeatedly struck with superhuman force, without being injured. She has withstood being zapped by Young Cyclops' optic blast,{{r|IVX Vol 1 5}} blows from Hulk,{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 2}} and blasts from the Dreaming Celestial. Despite the Celestial's blast breaking her arm off, this showed an incredibly powerful upper limit to Emma's powers, as a Juggernaut powered Colossus was hit by the same blast and was sent flying across the city with a hole through his chest.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 1}} Her body is also resistant to temperature extremes, able to withstand temperatures as cold as -390 degrees Fahrenheit or as hot as approximately 7362 degrees Fahrenheit before her form begins to melt.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 4}} Frost is also self-sustained while transformed, requiring no food or water.{{r|AVX: Vs #4}}
