As revenge towards the world, Quicksand tried to meltdown the reactor of an important nuclear plant. This led to a conflict between her and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]. Thor could not defeat Quicksand, but saved the surrounding area by launching the nuclear plant into a different dimension. Quicksand retreated, not wanting to meet Thor in battle again.{{r|Thor #392}}

Quicksand was then approached by [[Mongoose (Earth-616)|Mongoose]], an agent of the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]]. The Evolutionary wanted a tissue sample of Thor in order to create a species of super-gods. Mongoose promised Quicksand that the Evolutionary could restore her previous human form, if she could keep Thor busy for long enough for him to hit Thor with a ray and take the samples. However, Quicksand almost could not contain Thor, and she ran away the moment Mongoose finished his task.{{r|Thor #402|403}}

Quicksand later showed up as a member of [[Deidre Wentworth (Earth-616)|Superia]]'s all-female criminal organization, the [[Femizons (Earth-616)|Femizons]]. While the Femizons were on a [[S.S. Superia|cruise ship]] traveling to Superia's island, Quicksand had a disagreement with fellow villainess [[Blanche Sitznski (Earth-616)|Anaconda]] that turned violent. Anaconda's constricting ability proved to be of little use against Quicksand's power, however, leaving Quicksand triumphant.{{r|Captain America #389|391}}

Quicksand and Mongoose were apprehended by the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], and she agreed to work with [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]].{{r|Thunderbolts #103|104}}

===[[Dark Reign]]===
She later joined the [[Women Warriors (Earth-616)|Women Warriors]], an all-female team and part of the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] for [[Delaware (State)|Delaware]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #26}}

On that team, and along with [[Frank Payne (Earth-616)|Constrictor]], she confronted [[Radically Advanced Ideas in Destruction (Earth-616)|R.A.I.D.]],{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #29}} and later participated to [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Osborn]]'s attack on [[Asgard]]. She was among the squad to personally confront [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]].{{r|Siege Vol 1 #1|2}} 

===[[Fear Itself]]===
She was presumably captured and sent to the [[Raft]], which she seemingly escaped from during the [[Fear Itself]] events, when [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Kuurth (the Juggernaut)]] broke out. She was seemingly contained by [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]] on [[Long Island]] and handed over to the authorities,{{r|Avengers Academy #15}} but was later defeated by [[Tarene (Earth-616)|Thor Girl]] and [[Abigail Boylen (Earth-616)|Cloud Nine]] in [[Philadelphia (Pennsylvania)|Philadelphia]] before she could go on a rampage, just before the two heroes were attacked by the [[Liberteens (Earth-616)|Liberteens]].{{r|Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt #3}}

After the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers/X-Men conflict]], the Raft was damaged and numerous super-criminals were sent to another prison, unfit to store such individuals. A riot exploded, and Quicksand was key in the brawl, until she was defeated by both [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] and [[Calvin Rankin (Earth-616)|Mimic]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 275}}

Quicksand later became an experiment for [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]] who was forced to become an employee of [[Absolution Solutions (Earth-616)|Absolution Solutions]] and experiment on superhuman prisoners. Zola brainwashed Quicksand using a radioactive isotope and forced to go after [[Miranda Manuel (Earth-616)|D-Cel]], a [[Homo superior|mutant]] capable of slowing the kinetic movement of people and objects. With help from D-Cel and [[Damage Control (Earth-616)|Damage Control]], the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] was able to stop Quicksand and re-collect her granular body.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 3}}

Damage Control filtered the grains of Quicksand's body that contained Zola's mind-controlling isotope, and Juggernaut made Zola use what remained of Quicksand to help her reconstitute herself. Quicksand was about to kill Zola, but she was convinced to stand down by Juggernaut, who wanted her help in changing how superhuman prisoners were treated.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 5}}

| Powers                  = '''Bodily Transformation:''' Quicksand has the ability to transform the tissues of her body into a malleable substance very similar to sand. In this form, her frame gains an additional 16 inches in height and the sand-like tissues are much denser her human tissues, increasing her overall mass by an additional 400 pounds. While transformed, she possesses various superhuman attributes.<br>

*'''Shapeshifting:''' Quicksand is able to alter the shape of her body in a variety of ways for various purposes. She is able to essentially sculpt her body to create blunt weaponry, such as transforming her hands into large hammers or transfiguring her body into a cage. She is also able to alter her human shape and appear as a pile of sand, which can enable her to potentially squeeze through exceptionally small spaces and then reform herself at will. Quicksand is also able to disperse her body and, through some unknown means, generate intense winds over a small area. Essentially, she creates a sand storm by using her own body.

*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Quicksand's transformation grants her a body that is vastly stronger than her human form, or the form of any ordinary human. She possesses sufficient superhuman strength to lift approximately 80 tons.

*'''Superhuman Speed:''' Quicksand is able to run and move at speeds that are beyond the natural physical limits and capabilities of the finest human specimen.

*'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Quicksand's musculature is more efficient than that of an ordinary human. While her muscles aren't composed of the same organic tissue as a human's, they still produce some form of fatigue generating material causing her to tire. However, this material is significantly less than the fatigue toxins generated by organic muscle tissue. At her peak, she can exert herself for at least several hours before fatigue begins to affect her overall capabilities.

*'''Superhuman Durability:''' Since her body is composed of a very malleable sand-like material, Quicksand is virtually invulnerable to most forms of physical injury. She can alter the density of her body to literally make it rock hard, sufficiently so to withstand high caliber bullets and conventional bladed weaponry. She is also able to withstand great impacts such as being repeatedly struck with superhuman force or falling from great heights without sustaining injury. Even if she were to be shattered or grounded into an inert form, her consciousness would be completely unharmed and she would simply reform herself. She could still reform herself even if the material of her body was spread out over great distances, it would simply take longer.

*'''Superhuman Agility:''' In spite of her body's increased density, Quicksand's agility, balance and bodily coordination  are enhanced to levels beyond the natural physical limits and capabilities of the finest human specimen.

*'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Quicksand's reflexes are similarly enhanced and they're superior to those possessed by even the finest human specimen.

| Abilities               = Although she's had no formal training, Quicksand is a formidable combatant. Her great physical strength combined with the natural durability of her body, and with her ability to manipulate it, make her a difficult opponent to beat.<br>

| Strength                = 
| Weaknesses              = Quicksand's powers are very similar to those possessed by the [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]] and, as a result, she may, like him, be vulnerable to heat-based attacks. For example, since her body is composed of sand, it is possible that her tissues could crystallize and become glass if exposed to temperatures as high as 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It is also possible that she's vulnerable to water. If so, being wet could possibly transform her into little more than a mindless pile of mud until she was able to dry out.<br>
