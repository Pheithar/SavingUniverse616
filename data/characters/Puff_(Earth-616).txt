| History                 = When the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] were brought to [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]] by the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] to participate in the [[Secret Wars]] their teammate [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde's]] pet dragon [[Lockheed (Earth-616)|Lockheed]] were taken along with them. Early on in the war, Lockheed went missing and during his time away he met another similar dragon-like creature and returned to the X-Men with her following him the war's end. When the X-Men were about to teleport home, the dragon -- they nicknamed Puff -- would try to go with them disrupting their teleportation back to Earth.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 12}}

Most of the X-Men and the dragon were teleported to Japan, and by some twist of fate, Puff increased in size. Seeking to mate with Lockheed (unaware that he had changed in stature) she attacked Japan, seeking materials to build a nest. The combined efforts of the X-Men, [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]], and the Japanese military proved unable to stop the creature. After much destruction and loss of lives, Puff was defeated by Lockheed himself. The little dragon would reject her love and the heartbroken Puff committed suicide, causing herself to explode in a massive energy burst.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 181}}

Puff returned to life through unknown means and aided Lockheed and Kitty in Japan against the [[Keniuchio Harada (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]].{{r|X-Men: Kitty Pryde - Shadow & Flame Vol 1 4|5}}

Lockheed and Puff eventually become a couple and had children together.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 30}}
