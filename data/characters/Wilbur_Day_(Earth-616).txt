| History                 = Wilbur Day was a scientist employed by [[Carl Kaxton (Earth-616)|Carl Kaxton]] who invented a hydraulic ram device. Wilbur stole Kaxton's designs and used them to engineered a pair of extremely long, telescopic metal legs, which allowed him to tower high above the ground.{{r|Daredevil #8}} Lawyer [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]] was hired by Wilbur, who contacted Kaxton to tell him that his former employee intended to sue him, a threat which Kaxton encouraged them to follow through on. Later in his Daredevil guise, Murdock unsuccessfully battled Stilt-Man, who managed to get away. Later, when meeting with Wilbur again, Kaxton arrived at the [[Nelson and Murdock (Earth-616)|Nelson and Murdock]] offices to contest the lawsuit. While the two argued over who owned the rights to the [[Stilt-Man's Suit|hydraulic device]], Matt noticed that one of them was lying due to an irregular heart beat, but couldn't figure out which one was the liar because they were too close together.

Following Kaxton as Daredevil, he was quickly shaken by Kaxton, who realized he wa being followed. Daredevil couldn't resume tailing because of reports that Stilt-Man was causing havoc again. He again failed to stop Stilt-Man. Returning to Day, the two went to confront Kaxton directly. There they found the hydraulic lifts, which turned out to be Stilt-Man's stilts. Attacked by Kaxton with a gun, Day managed to knock Kaxton out, and then revealed to Murdock that he was really Stilt-Man, and that he came to steal a shrinking device from Kaxton before knocking Murdock out. Taking the device and making a run for it in his stilts, Day was followed by Daredevil, and in the ensuing battle the shrinking ray was turned on Day, who shrank so small that he disappeared from sight. Returning to the Nelson and Murdock law office, Matt was confronted by Kaxton, but Murdock told him that Day had dropped the lawsuit and they decided to let the whole thing go.{{r|Daredevil #8}}

He was once saved by the [[Frank Farnum (Earth-616)|Masked Marauder]] and teamed up with him to kidnap the Nelson and Murdock law firm employees.{{r|Daredevil #26}} After fighting Spider-Man he went to fire a ray gun as he was standing in water and shorted out his electrical systems leaving him unconscious and ready to be picked up by the police.{{r|Daredevil #27}}

However, he was rescued by the supervillain [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]] and joined his [[Emissaries of Evil (Electro) (Earth-616)|Emissaries of Evil]]. Their plan was to defeat Daredevil as a team, but they were in turn defeated themselves.{{r|Daredevil Annual #1}}{{r|Giant-Size Daredevil #1}} Wilbur was later hired to kill district attorney candidate [[Franklin Nelson (Earth-616)|Foggy]], but was stopped by Daredevil.{{r|Daredevil #48}} Wilbur then disguised as [[George Smith (Earth-616)|Stunt-Master]] and attacked Daredevil on a [[Hollywood]] movie set.{{r|Daredevil #67}}

In [[San Francisco]], Stilt-Man kidnapped Carl Kaxton and his daughter, to force him to recreate his molecular condenser. Kaxton kept working, but ran out of parts, so Stilt-Man had to arrange for others to be brought in. Stilt-Man brought back the new parts and forced Kaxton to get back to work. When Kaxton briefly refused, Stilt-Man struck him and reminded him that Barbara could be turned over to Endros. Stilt-Man soon took the finished condenser, with which he planned to shrink the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], taking Barbara with him. Daredevil soon arrived and defeated Endros. The hero had to strike Kaxton to get useful information from him about Barbara, then he rescued her with [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]]. They picked Kaxton up and took him to breakfast with Barbara after Stilt-Man was defeated. Later, a homeless man, Eddie, found the condenser and planned to sell it to Jonny the Rake, but chose to throw it away instead.{{r|Daredevil #102}}

Stilt-Man came across the still hovering [[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Trapster]] and took his weaponry. As [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] was about to testify against his former associates, Stilt-Man attacked. The heroes eventually managed to topple Stilt-Man and defeat him, despite his advantage of Trapster's weapons.{{r|Captain America #191}} Stilt-Man continued his criminal career and fought several superheroes such as Black Goliath,{{r|Black Goliath #4}} but without much success.{{r|Black Goliath #5}} He battled the [[Champions of Los Angeles (Earth-616)|Champions of Los Angeles]] as well.{{r|Champions #11|12}} Wilbur freed [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]] and [[F.A.U.S.T.]], and was given a special new battlesuit constructed of secondary [[Adamantium]].{{r|Thor #268|269}} He stole some radioactive isotopes and battled [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], but lost the fight and was stripped of his suit.{{r|Thor #270|271}}

When his armor was stolen by a small-time crook named [[Turk Barrett (Earth-616)|Turk Barrett]], Day contacted Daredevil and informed him of a weakness in the armor. Thanks to Day's information, Daredevil easily disabled the auto-gyroscopes necessary for the armor to keep its balance and brought Turk down. Day later modified the armor to prevent Daredevil from using this newfound knowledge against him.{{r|Daredevil #186}} In an attempt to regain his reputation, Stilt-Man set out to defeat Spider-Man. He turned an automated [[Cordco (Earth-616)|Cordco]] factory against the wall-crawler. When Spidey saved his life from an automatic sonic disruptor, Wilbur decided not to kill him. He delivered Spidey's unconscious body to [[Vincent Martinelli (Earth-616)|Vincent Martinelli]]'s security detail and left the premises.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #237}}

Wilbur was one of the many armored villains whose technology had been upgraded from stolen plans from [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]]. He was intercepted by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] during a robbery, and Wilbur attempted to flee using newly-implemented failsafe bootjets that ejected him from his hydraulic legs. Iron Man took one of the legs and used it to club Stilt-Man, knocking him out. Afterward, Iron Man used a negator pack on the unconscious Stilt-Man which neutralized any trace of Stark tech in his armor.{{r|Iron Man #225}}

Stilt-Man later attempted to kill D.A. [[Blake Tower (Earth-616)|Blake Tower]] for sending him to prison, but was captured by [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]].{{r|Sensational She-Hulk #4}} During the [[Acts of Vengeance (Event)|Acts of Vengeance]] enacted by a cabal of super villains, Stilt-Man fell under the mind control of [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] and was ordered, alongside many other villains, to attack the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] while they were giving a speech to the congress. He and his fellow attackers were defeated by [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|The Thing]], the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and the [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|She-Thing]].{{r|Fantastic Four #336}}

Wilbur was one of the villains who attempted to attack the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] at the site of their reconstructed mansion, but was foiled by the construction workers.{{r|Avengers Annual #19}} Wilbur was a regular visitor to the [[Bar With No Name]].{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #97}} Stilt-Man is listed in one of Spider-Man's most embarrassing moments.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #12}} Wilbur and various other criminals witnessed [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] disguised as [[Crossbones]] battle [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc the Leaper]].{{r|Captain America #411|413}}

Stilt-Man joined [[Jason Macendale Jr. (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]]'s team when they battled [[Alpha Flight (Earth-1610)|Alpha Flight]].{{r|Alpha Flight #121}} He then appeared in the gallery during the Tinkerer's court case.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk #59}}[[Philip Sheldon (Earth-616)|Phil Sheldon]] captured an image of Stilt-Man during a crime at some point.{{r|Marvels #2}} Stilt-Man later attended the wedding of [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]] and [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]].{{r|Avengers: Unplugged #4}} While the heroes were away fighting the [[Secret Wars]], the New York Police Department faced many supervillains such as Stilt-Man.{{r|Code of Honor #3}}{{r|Cable #56}} Wilbur would later join Kingpin's [[Emissaries of Evil (Kingpin) (Earth-616)|Emissaries of Evil]], along with [[Le Concierge (Earth-616)|Le Concierge]] and [[Max Mullins (Earth-616)|Synapse]].{{r|Daredevil #377|380}}

When Daredevil's secret identity as Matt Murdock was exposed by a local newspaper, Wilbur visited the law offices of Nelson and Murdock, announcing he was sick of the whole ordeal and that he was retiring as Stilt-Man. He left his armor in a suitcase on Murdock's desk, and was forcibly removed when he began yelling his paranoid conclusion that Murdock was the real Kingpin. Murdock then jokingly asked his law partner, Foggy Nelson, if he'd like to be the next Stilt-Man, an offer he quickly declined.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 41}} However, Wilbur returned to his old ways.{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #6}}{{r|Spider-Man Human Torch #3}} He was eventually arrested again and locked up in the [[Raft]].{{r|Spider-Man: Breakout #1}}

When the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] was implemented, Wilbur signed up with the government and was outfitted with a new suit to serve as a law-enforcer during the ensuing [[Civil War (Event)|superhuman civil war]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #533}} Fashioning himself a reformed hero, Stilt-Man ran into the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] while both were targeting child pornographer [[Fulvio Morsella (Earth-616)|Fulvio Morsella]]. Wilbur offered the vigilante to team-up, but the Punisher held him accountable for his past life of crime and blew his legs up. Wilbur attempted to surrender, having realized that he and the Punisher weren't on the same page, but the Punisher shot and killed him.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 1}} After his death, many supervillains held a wake for him at a [[Bar with No Name]] where it was revealed he had married [[Zelda DuBois (Earth-616)|Princess Python]].{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 #2}}

Day's death became a ''cause célèbre'' for an anti-technology anarchist terrorist cell who called themselves the [[Bastard Sons of Wilbur Day (Earth-616)|Bastard Sons of Wilbur Day]], despite Spider-Man pointing out that their beliefs and goals had very little to do with anything Day had believed.{{r|Invincible Iron Man #500}} Another criminal, [[Callie Ryan (Earth-616)|Lady Stilt-Man]], paid homage to him posthumously.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #611}}

Several years later, the new [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Jackal]] brought many of Spider-Man's dead friends and foes back to life, including Stilt-Man, as part of a cheme to turn the web-slinger to his side. After being presented with this while under Jackal's custody, Spider-Man fled from his base with the help of the [[Gwendolyn Stacy (Earth-65)|Spider-Woman]] of [[Earth-65]].{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 2}} Stilt-Man and the other revived villains were sent out to look for them.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 3}} When the Jackal's ally, [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]], turned against him, he triggered the decay of all the people he had cloned back to life.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 4}} Spider-Man managed to stop this, but not before many people had died. Stilt-Man was one of the survivors.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 5}}

As part of a plan to sow chaos in revenge for the loss of their fortune, the criminal Stromwyn siblings hired a group of super villains to wreak havoc in Hell's Kitchen. Stilt-Man was one of the villains alongside [[Brock Rumlow (Earth-616)|Crossbones]], [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]], [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]] and [[Buck Cashman (Earth-616)|Bullet]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 6 19}} Day terrorized the neighbor using explosives, and when Daredevil confronted the villains, he stopped Stilt-Man by using one of his explosives against him, destroying his robotic legs.{{r|Daredevil Vol 6 20}}

Tired of the constant humiliation he endured, Stilt-Man devised a plan to prove himself a leader. Finding the planet where the race of robotic giants known as [[Ultimos (Race)|Ultimos]] originated, Wilbur learned to reprogram them. Using an "interference beam" under his command, Wilbur routinely abducted random people from across the universe to this planet. Pretending that the same thing had inexplicably happened to him, Wilbur used his intellect to establish and run [[Megiddo (Space Colony)|Megiddo]], a small and peaceful colony where its inhabitants lived an unburdened life. In order give the colony something to bond over to avoid dissension, Day also regularly controlled the Ultimos remotely to attack the village and keep them as a looming threat.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 11}} Due to his reputation as a super villain, Wilbur operated mostly from the shadows, using a [[Kree]] soldier named [[Yar (Earth-616)|Yar]] as the public leader.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 10}}

After hearing an S.O.S. signal from a spaceship piloted by Iron Man when the hero was pursuing the power-hungry android [[Michael Korvac (Earth-691)|Korvac]], Stilt-Man decided to abduct Stark to show the fruit of his labor.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 11}} Iron Man was initially captivated by the Meigddan's humble lifestyle as well as Stilt-Man's apparent change of heart,{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 10}} but the constant threat of the Ultimos prompted him to look into them, and he ultimately discovered that Day was remotely controlling the killer robots. Together with another Megiddan, [[Colin Richard (Earth-616)|Avro-X]], Iron Man confronted and defeated Stilt-Man. Afterward, the Megiddans took Wilbur away to punish him. In the aftermath of Stilt-Man's ruse being exposed, the [[Adam Warlock (Earth-19141)|Living Tribunal]] sought Iron Man to continue his pursuit of Korvac, and the hero asked him in exchange to return everyone on Megidda home.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 11}} It can be presumed Stilt-Man was therefore returned to Earth.
