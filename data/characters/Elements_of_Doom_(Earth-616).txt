| HistoryText             = The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] encountered a hostile group of alien invaders at a Russian nuclear facility. The aliens supplanted human beings with energy constructs based on elements in the periodic table. The Avengers defeated the elements and buried them under a mass of molten stone and steel. The reactor later experienced a meltdown and the entire facility was sealed in cement as a safety measure.{{r|Avengers #188}} Later, [[Esteban Coraz√≥n de Ablo (Earth-616)|Diablo]] broke the dimensional barrier with his arcane knowledge bringing the creatures back to life forming an alliance with the goal of dominating the world.{{r|Avengers Collector's Edition #1}}

A later incarnation of the team, created without using human hosts fought the Thunderbolts. One of them killed Techno by snapping his neck.{{r|Thunderbolts #6|8}}
