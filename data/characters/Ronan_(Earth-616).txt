===Early Life===
Upon the completion of his formal education, Ronan was enrolled in the [[Kree]] [[Accuser Corps (Earth-616)|Public Accuser Corps]], the main law enforcement body for the empire. Ronan did well and was steadily promoted. In a border incident, he stopped a fleet of [[Skrull]] ships from entering [[Kree Empire|Kree space]]. As a result, he was made Supreme Accuser of the Kree Empire, making him responsible for enforcing the laws and decrees of the Kree, and second only to the [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]], and the Imperial Minister. As a proud member of the Kree aristocracy (blue-skinned Kree), he was not happy taking orders from the Supreme Intelligence. His attempt to cause a civil war was quickly halted, and he quickly returned to service.{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #Fantastic Four}}

===Fantastic Four===
Ronan's first encounter with [[Earth]] heroes was when the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] defeated [[Sentry 459 (Earth-616)|Kree Sentry #459]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 65}}[[File:Ronan original look (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Vol 1 65 0001.png|thumb|right|Ronan's original look.]]

===Captain Marvel===
[[File:Ronan (Earth-616) from Captain Marvel Vol 1 41 001.png|thumb|left|Ronan's purple armor]]Ronan battled [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Mar-Vell]] on several occasions.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 1}}{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 5}}{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 7}}{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 10}}
He secretly planned with [[Zarek (Earth-616)|Zarek]] to overthrow the Kree leader, the Supreme Intelligence, believing the Empire should not be ruled by a non-humanoid entity but he was stopped by Captain Marvel and the Supreme Intelligence itself, which incarcerated him.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 16}}

===[[Kree-Skrull War]]===
Ronan escaped from his confinement and led a temporary coup against the Supreme Intelligence when active hostilities broke out with the Skrulls. He imprisoned the Earth youth [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] until the Intelligence unleashed the [[Glossary:Destiny Force|Destiny Force]] within Jones, ending the war.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 95|97}}

===Mental Domination===
However the Accuser continued to serve the Kree Empire being mentally dominated by the Supreme Intelligence for a period of time, and battled Mar-Vell on multiple occasions.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 41}}{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 47|49}} He later regained his sanity and returned to his former position as Supreme Accuser.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 19}}

===Kree/Shi'ar War===
During [[Operation Galactic Storm|Operation: Galactic Storm]], Ronan and the Accusers defended the Kree Empire from [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]] intervention. When the Supreme Intelligence regained power, he recruited Ronan for the Kree [[Starforce (Earth-616)|Starforce]] on an assassination mission against [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Empress Lilandra]].{{r|Thor Vol 1 446}}

===Inhumans===
Later, Ronan attempted to press the [[Inhumans (Race)|Inhumans]] into service, as they had been created by the Kree. Although [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] defeated Ronan in a contest, many Inhumans chose to stay in space regardless.{{r|Inhumans Vol 3 #3|4}}

===The Watcher===
Ronan also unsuccessfully tried to regain the Kree '[[Psyche-Magnitron]]' from the [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Watcher]].

===[[Maximum Security]]===
During the [[Ruul]]'s [[Maximum Security|attempt to turn Earth into an intergalactic prison]], Ronan was empowered with the vast energies of [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego]]. This energy was contained by [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]], and Ronan was defeated.{{r|Maximum Security #3}}

===[[Annihilation (Event)|Annihilation]]===
Ronan was framed and stripped of his Accuser Rank by House Fiyero.{{r|Annihilation: Prologue #1}} He sought out the only witness, [[Tana Nile (Earth-616)|Tana Nile]], who was part of [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]]'s [[Graces (Earth-616)|Graces]]. Unfortunately, Tana Nile was killed by the [[Annihilation Wave (Earth-616)|Annihilation Wave]] commanded by [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]] before Ronan could learn exactly who had set him up. The ruling Kree remained ignorant of the threat the Wave posed and Ronan sought to warn them.{{r|Annihilation: Ronan #1|4}}

Ronan later joined with the [[United Front (Earth-616)|United Front]] along with [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] on the front lines against the Annihilation Wave. Many rank and file Kree trusted him over the commanders appointed by Fiyero, in the war against Annihilus.{{r|Annihilation Vol 1 1}}

Ronan eventually returned to Hala with his sworn enemy [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Kl'rt the Super-Skrull]] and [[Praxagora (Earth-616)|Praxagora]] to dethrone the House Fiyero who were planning to side with [[Ravenous (Earth-616)|Ravenous]] and Annihilus. After knocking Ravenous unconscious and killing the House Fiyero, Ronan attempted to locate the Supreme Intelligence, only to find that Fiyero had lobotomized it. Mercifully killing it, Ronan exited its chamber to thunderous cheers of the Kree people, who unanimously called on him to become their new emperor.{{r|Annihilation Vol 1 5}}

When Ravenous later came back to Hala with a stronger force, Ronan led a violent attack on Ravenous' fleet; in which entire building complexes were rocket propelled at Ravenous' forces and decimated the Annihilation forces. After the massive destruction of the Annihilation Wave by [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]], Ronan was part of the participants in forging a treaty between the United Front and [[Ravenous (Earth-616)|Ravenous]] that ceded certain Kree territories and all of the former [[Skrull Empire]] in order to end the hostilities.{{r|Annihilation #6}}

===[[Annihilation: Conquest]]===
When the [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]] invaded and assimilated the Kree, Ronan was forced to serve them to protect the Empire.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith #1}} He was freed by the [[Wraith (Kree) (Earth-616)|Wraith]], whose Exolon symbiotes can drive fear into the Phalanx. Along with [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Kl'rt]], [[Praxagora (Earth-616)|Praxagora]], and [[Ra-Venn (Earth-616)|Ra-Venn]], Ronan made his way to Kree-Lar, the ceded Kree capital, now under the control of the N-Zone bugs, who were putting up quite a fight with the Phalanx. Ronan called to make an alliance, when he was actually looking to activate the 15,000 [[Kree Sentries]] beneath the palace. Originally meant for an eventual strike to take back their territories from the bugs, Ronan was going to use them to annihilate Hala, as a means to free his people from servitude. To that end, he had Praxagora and Wraith render the Sentries immune to the [[Techno-Organic Virus|Transmode Virus]].{{r|Annihilation: Conquest #4}}

As the Sentries approached Hala, Ra-Venn informed Ronan that [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]], [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]], and [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] have gone head-to-head with the Phalanx and asked that he call off the strike. However, Ronan refused to. Unfortunately, [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]], who had taken over Praxagora, took control of the sentries to form a new body. Kl'rt barely managed to shield them all before Praxagora self-destructed. Descending to the surface, they helped Quasar defeat Ultron, by having Wraith use his Exolons to trap Ultron. With the Phalanx defeated, Ronan was left to pick up the pieces of the Kree Empire.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest #5|6}}

===[[Secret Invasion]] and [[War of Kings]]===
When the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] left Earth's [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]] in searching and rescuing Black Bolt from the Skrulls following their invasion of Earth, [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] tried to establish an alliance between the Inhumans and the Kree to help find Black Bolt and free him from his Skrull captors. Ronan agreed, but only on the condition that Medusa's sister [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]] became his bride. He provided them with information regarding the Skrull communications network, which the Kree have been trying for years to crack.{{r|Secret Invasion: Inhumans #2|3}}

Shortly after the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]], the Inhumans arrived at the Kree homeland, and after subduing his bodyguards, confronted the Kree ruler, Ronan. Defeated, Ronan knelt before Black Bolt as the new ruler of the Kree Empire. To bring their two races closer together, Ronan and Crystal's marriage proceeded. However, Crystal saw the marriage as a political affair, to Ronan's disappointment.{{r|War of Kings #1}} On the wedding day, he was severely beaten by the [[Shi'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]] and was hospitalized.{{r|War of Kings #1}}

===The War of the Four Cities===
The Inhumans went back to Earth, Ronan resuscitates the Supreme Intelligence of the Kree using the minds of two alternate Reed Richards and the seed of the Supreme Intelligence, log hidden in the heft of Ronan's weapon.{{r|FF #6|7}}

===The Annihilators===
During the war with the Cancerverse, Ronan was a member of Nova's main attack force. In an effort to prevent further massive conflicts, Ronan joined the Annihilators. They protected Galador from the Dire Wraiths and oppose the Universal Church of Truth's attempt to revive the Magus.

===Separated===
Ronan was separated from his wife Crystal under the orders of Black Bolt. This separation was part of a truce that was made between Black Bolt and the Supreme Intelligence to ensure peace between Inhumans and the Kree Empire. Crystal and Ronan were deeply saddened by this decision, as their arranged marriage had eventually become a stronger relationship.

===[[Black Vortex]]===
After the resurgence of the [[Black Vortex]], Ronan and the Accuser Corps retrieved it from [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]], [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]], who had submitted to its power and planned to reshape the universe with it.{{r|All-New X-Men #38}}

In retaliation, the three cosmically-enhanced beings assaulted [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]].{{r|All-New X-Men #39}} The Accuser Corps tried to fend off their attackers, but were notably overpowered. Ronan requested the Supreme Intelligence to use the Black Vortex's power to fight back, but the Supremor denied him of his request, arguing using the device would even lessen the chances of survival of Hala. Despite these warnings, Ronan submitted to the Black Vortex, ensuring a successful defense for the Kree homeworld, and forcing Gamora, Beast, and Angel to flee after the latter was knocked down.{{r|Guardians Team-Up #3}}

Hala was subsequently destroyed by [[J'son (Earth-616)|Mister Knife]], another player in the conflict who was looking for the Black Vortex.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 25}} Ronan later set out to rebuild the fallen Kree empire and seek revenge for the destruction of its homeworld.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: Black Vortex Omega #1}}

===Plex Intelligence===
In an act of penance, Ronan roamed alone the ruins of his planet, being slowly driven mad as he vowed to remember the names of all the Kree killed during Hala's destruction. He came into conflict with the crew aboard the spaceship [[Astarion]], which included several Inhumans, including Crystal, as well as their guide [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Marvel Boy]], when said vessel entered the airspace of the dead planet. Ronan struck down the Astarion, and used his new powers to trap their crew in pocket universes that took form based on their victim's regrets, with the exception of Crystal, whom Ronan personally confronted.{{r|Royals Vol 1 4}}

Crystal attempted to reason with Ronan, as he blamed the destruction of Hala on his emotional state caused by his break-up with her. Once Ronan listened to the voice of reason, he decided to blame himself for having disobeyed the Supreme Intelligence when Hala was under attack. Ronan attempted to commit suicide, but Crystal stopped him. Ronan's hope for the Kree Empire was subsequently strengthened when Marvel Boy planted the seed of his reality's [[We-Plex Supreme Intelligence System (Earth-200080)|Plex Intelligence]] into the remains of the Supreme Intelligence, giving Ronan a new leader for him to follow. Even though Ronan believed once again in a future with the mighty Kree Empire, he couldn't find self-forgiveness, and continued blaming himself for Hala's destruction.{{r|Royals #5}}

===Death of Inhumans===
When a contingent of Kree arrived back at Hala after generations of exploration, they were shocked to find their world in ruins and the Kree Empire in disarray. So, the contingent began the rebuilding of the Kree Empire. Believing that continuing to follow the orders of the Supreme Intelligence was archaic, they chose to take Ronan prisoner.{{r|Death of Inhumans #2}}

They cruelly experimented on him, replacing parts of his body with cybernetics. He was eventually found by the Inhuman king Black Bolt. Ronan explained to Black Bolt what the Kree were planning and apologized for the times he hurt the Inhuman Royal Family, including Crystal. He also begged Black Bolt not to let the Kree turn him into one of their puppets. Black Bolt whispered that he forgave Ronan before putting him out of his misery.{{r|Death of Inhumans Vol 1 3}}
