| History                 = Jonathan Ohnn earned his doctorate at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]], where he was roommates with [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Quentin Beck]].{{r|Symbiote Spider-Man Vol 1 1}} He was a divorced father whose son was named [[Wyatt Ohnn (Earth-616)|Wyatt]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 589}} As a scientist working for the Kingpin, Dr. Ohnn was assigned to reproduce the radiation levels of the vigilante [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] to find a way to artificially mimic his powers. Working late one night, he succeeded, creating a solid black circular portal. In doing so, however, the drain on the city's power became so great, a blackout washed over the city, causing the portal to shimmer and destabilize. Fearful of losing a once in a lifetime opportunity, Ohnn stepped into it; the shock of the transition caused him to pass out. He awoke floating weightlessly in a dimension which he initially assumed was Cloak's dark dimension. He soon realized however that the power shortage caused the portal to send him to a different dimension, a place of half darkness and half light. A seemingly infinite number of portals surrounded him in this place. Making swimming motions, he managed to find the original portal that brought him there and slipped back through it.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #98}}

When Ohnn emerged back in his lab, his body had undergone a radical transformation. The portals from the other dimension had adhered to his skin, covering him with black spots from head to toe. Realizing the spots were portable space warps, he started to think he might be able to use them to defeat anyone in battle. When [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and the [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] arrived to confront the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]], he appeared before them and announced himself as the Spot. Spider-Man collapsed on the roof, laughing at the name.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #98}} The Spot ended up winning that first confrontation and warned the heroes to leave the Kingpin alone.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #99}} He later lost a second battle against Spider-Man because he was tricked into throwing too many of his spots as weapons and not keeping enough to defend himself with.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #100}}

Later, the Spot formed a short-lived team with [[Martin Blank (Earth-616)|Gibbon]], [[Maxwell Markham (Earth-616)|Grizzly]], and [[Brian Hibbs (Earth-616)|Kangaroo]] called the [[Spider-Man Revenge Squad (Earth-616)|Spider-Man Revenge Squad]]. This team fell apart when Spider-Man carted the Spot and the Kangaroo to jail for bank robbery.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #245|246}}{{r|Marvel Apes #1}} Sometime later, the Spot was captured by an organization called The [[Gideon Trust (Earth-616)|Gideon Trust]] and was forced to open a portal to the [[Negative Zone]]. The Gideon Trust hoped to investigate and exploit the natural resources of the Zone for their own purposes, but were defeated by the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] who were trapped there at the time.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 #38}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 #44}}

The Spot later helped [[Lonnie Lincoln (Earth-616)|Tombstone]] escape from a maximum security prison. As a method of thanking him, Tombstone snapped his neck.{{r|Spider-Man's Tangled Web #16|17}} Despite his apparent death, Spot would resurface years laters. During a meeting with [[Jalome Beacher (Earth-616)|Slyde]], Spot was killed by [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]] and a group of [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] ninja.{{r|Civil War: War Crimes #1}} When [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], The Hand, and the mutant group [[Dawn of the White Light (Earth-616)|Dawn of the White Light]] began a plot to end all life on Earth, they resurrected Ohnn and he joined an assault on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]], which resulted in its destruction.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 #26}} He was then killed again by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], as were most of the operatives The Hand were using in the attack.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 #27}}

Spot resurfaced alive yet again, joining a ragtag team assembled by [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]] When Spot confronted the [[Temugin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]], the villain used his black light ring to entrap John in his own anti-dimension. Since he hadn't entered it out of his own volition, it became impossible for him to know which spot was the way out.{{r|Super-Villain Team-Up MODOK's 11 #1|3}} Occasionally, Ohnn would manage to project his image back into the normal world, and at one point he tried to contact some of his friends at the [[Bar with No Name]] to no avail. As he was being driven mad by his entrapment, John decided to concentrate on the mental image of his son Wyatt, and used him as a beacon that allowed him to come back to the normal world. However, John returned to learn that Wyatt had been caught in the fire of a butchered drive-by orchestrated by Russian mob boss [[Dmitri Ivankov (Earth-616)|Dmitri Ivankov]] and was in a coma. When Spot intercepted Ivankov at a meeting to kill him in revenge, but the criminal was saved by Spider-Man, who had happened to be at the scene gathering proof of his illicit activities. Spot continued attempting to murder Ivanov until Spider-Man stood his ground. When the hero made it clear that he intended to protect Ivankov's life, Spot handed him over a package addressed to Wyatt, as well as a letter explaining what had happened to him, and teleported away. However, because of his madness, the letter itself was only lines of dots. When Spider-Man delivered the package to the hospital where Wyatt was hospitalized, the package turned out to be a copy of ''{{WP|Treasure Island}}'' that John used to read his son every night.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 589}}

Afterward, Spot was recruited by mob boss [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mister Negative]], another criminal whose powers derived from the Darkforce. In exchange for Spot's help in taking down the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]], Mister Negative pledged to find a cure to his powers. Ohnn then joined [[Hood's Gang (Earth-616)|The Hood's Gang]] on Mister Negative's behalf and acted as a mole. When [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|The Hood]] attempted to take over Mister Negative's territory, the Spot gave him an early warning, and also helped Mister Negative escape from the clutches of his adversary.{{r|Dark Reign: Mister Negative Vol 1 #1|3}}

When [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] set out to kidnap the newborn [[Stanley Osborn (Earth-616)|Stanley Osborn]], he assembled an army of villains to do his bidding, including the Spot.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 642}} Spider-Man became tangled in the pursuit for the baby and, after the [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]] led him to believe the infant had died,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 645}} he went on a rampage against the villains involved in Octopus' plan. He delivered the Spot webbed up to the police alongside [[Esteban Coraz√≥n de Ablo (Earth-616)|Diablo]] and [[James Beverley (Earth-616)|Overdrive]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 646}}

Later, Spot was hired by Sal Donoratti to kidnap the daughter of Deborah Giacomo, thinking the family would pay a lot for the safety of the child. Spot killed Donoratti so he couldn't speak while fighting [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]]. Thanks to Daredevil's radar sense, Spot was not much of a challenge for the hero, who was easily knocked out.{{r|Daredevil Vol 3 #1}} However, the Spot was captured and restrained and his powers were recreated by an individual called [[Coyote (Earth-616)|Coyote]], working for an unknown figure trying to bring Daredevil down.{{r|Punisher Vol 9 #3}}{{r|Daredevil Vol 3 #20|21}}

Following Hydra's short-lived takeover of the United States, the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] became fascinated with the idea of weaponizing Darkforce like Hydra had done to encase [[Manhattan]] in an impenetrable dome. To this end, Fisk had Spot captured and experimented on to amplify and extract his connection to the Darkforce Dimension. When Kingpin and [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] joined forces to capture the demonic entity [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Kindred]], Spot was used to encase the demon in a Darkforce construct.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 56}} When Osborn decided to free Kindred, he enlisted Spot to free the demon in exchange for his own freedom.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 66}}

| Powers                  = '''Teleportation:''' As a being exposed to the Spotted Dimension, Ohnn's skin has been bleached white and dotted with warps in space. The spots can transport things or people to another area by way of passing through the Spotted Dimension and coming out in another 'spot'. Ohnn can also teleport himself or extend parts of his own body over various distances as defined by his spots. He has the ability to move the spots all over his body or take them off and place them somewhere else. The spots can even be suspended in mid-air.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #10}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 11}}{{r|Heroic Age: Villains #1}}
