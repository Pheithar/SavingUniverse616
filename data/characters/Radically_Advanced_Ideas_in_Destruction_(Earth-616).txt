R.A.I.D. supplant [[Hydra (Earth-616)|HYDRA]] as the world's leading terrorist group after that group had been considerably weakened by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|James Howlett]]. To this end, R.A.I.D. was responsible for a superhuman terrorist strike on [[London (England)|London]]. Plan A of this attack was to wipe out the Houses of Parliament, but when this was interrupted by an ad hoc team of heroes led by [[Joseph Chapman (Earth-616)|Union Jack]], they reverted to Plan B, to cause massive civilian casualties throughout the city.{{r|Union Jack Vol 2 1}} 

Superhuman operatives attempted to destroy the Thames Tunnel, Tower Bridge and Heathrow Airport before being defeated by Union Jack and his team.{{r|Union Jack Vol 2 2}} The terrorists also smuggled in a disassembled [[Dreadnought (Robot)|Dreadnought]] to use as a weapon of mass destruction against the city's populus. It started by attacking Trafalgar Square before Union Jack was able to bring it down.{{r|Union Jack Vol 2 4}}

R.A.I.D. was one of the A.I.M. splinter groups taken down by [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Bobby Da Costa]] and his [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|Avengers Idea Mechanics]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 18}}
