===Origin===
Adam was one of the several children genetically engineered from the DNA of [[D'ken Neramani (Earth-616)|Emperor D'ken]] of the [[Shi'ar Empire]] and [[Katherine Summers (Earth-616)|Katherine Summers]] from [[Earth]]. They were part of the Emperor's attempt to introduce the genetic potential of other species into the Shi'ar royal family.{{r|X-Men Legends #1|2}}{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 3 3}}

Adam was abducted from the laboratory in which he was created by [[Jonath (Earth-616)|Jonath]] — former commander of the Emperor's personal guard. Jonath brought him to an outback farming planet called [[Ch'reesharaa]] and hid his true origins. He raised Adam as his own son, teaching him to fight and farm.{{r|X-Men Legends #1}}{{r|X-Force Annual #2}}

Years later, when his mutant powers first manifested, the fellow villagers shunned him out of fear. Jonath told him that Adam was a hybrid and if he wanted to learn more about his powers, then he would need to visit [[Earth]] someday.{{r|X-Men Legends #1}} 

At some point the villagers captured wounded Imperial Praetor Guards. They helped them recover and then released them. However, the Guards returned with members of the [[Crystal Claws (Earth-616)|Crystal Claws]] — fanatic followers of the now-former emperor D'ken. They learned of Adam's existence and wanted to use him to reclaim the throne of the Shi'ar Empire from [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Empress Lilandra]]. Jonath refused to give up Adam, so the Crystal Claws attacked the planet. Jonath and his comrades sacrificed their lives in order to give Adam enough time to escape.{{r|X-Men Legends #1|2}}{{r|X-Force Annual #2}} 

After leaving Ch'reesharaa, Adam wandered from place to place for years; never staying anywhere for long. He became a fierce warrior and an experienced pilot,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 39}} and eventually decided to visit Earth to learn more about his origins.{{r|X-Men Legends #1}}{{r|X-Force Annual #2}}

===Strong Industries vs X-Force===
Adam had no knowledge of Earth, so he didn't know where to start looking for answers. He was contacted by [[Martin Strong (Earth-616)|Martin Strong]] who proposed a deal — Adam would help him hunt down other mutants, while Martin would use his contacts to find out information about Adam's origins. Adam agreed and joined Strong Industries. Since he hadn't known his surname, Strong gave him the name '''Adam-X''' and also nicknamed him '''X-Treme''' for his temper and abilities.{{r|X-Force Annual #2}}

At the Strong Industries, Adam met [[Michelle Balters (Earth-616)|Michelle Balters]]; they both felt a mutual attraction and soon fell in love. However, when she ran away from Strong, Adam was ordered to return her. When he found Michelle, [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] intervened, but Adam easily neutralized them and retreated. Later he agreed to help X-Force take down Strong, using his powers to defeat him. [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] offered him a position with X-Force, but Adam refused, still wanting to find answers to his questions.{{r|X-Force Annual #2}}

===Searching for answers===
Weeks later Adam was captured by [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] who pitted him against [[Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse)|Shatterstar]] in a life-or-death battle. After a short battle, the two joined together and defeated Arcade together, forcing him to tell that he was hired by [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Milbury]] to test Adam.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 29|30}}

Adam searched for information about Mr. Milbury, but couldn't find much. The only clue he found was about Milbury's involvement in the [[Alamogordo|Alamogordo Research Facility]] decades ago alongside [[Alexander Ryking (Earth-616)|Alexander Ryking]]. He tracked down Ryking's son [[Carter Ryking (Earth-616)|Carter]] in [[Roswell State Minimum Security Prison]] to learn anything he could about Milbury. Ryking was unable to provide any useful information and instead directed Adam to [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 38}}

===Meeting with Philip Summers===
Instead of heading to [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], however, Adam for some reason went to [[Alaska (State)|Alaska]]. One day he witnessed the crash of the airplane from afar. He rushed to the place just in time to save the pilot — [[Philip Summers (Earth-616)|Philip Summers]] — from the plane's explosion. He carried Philip away and took care of him for several days before they were discovered and rescued. In the hospital Adam met [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], who sensed that there was a connection between Adam and the Summers family. Before leaving the hospital, Adam allowed Jean to transfer memories of his days as a Shi'ar combat pilot to Philip as a farewell gift.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 39}}

===Eric the Red===
Adam continued his search and came across the Shi'ar agent [[Davan Shakari (Earth-616)|Eric the Red]], facing him in battle he lost and was brainwashed.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 41}}{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 3 2}} Eric sent him to kill [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Genis-Vell]], but during the battle they were displaced to the [[Negative Zone]] which freed Adam from Shikari's mind control. Together, Adam and Genis went to Shakari's base where they had to fight with the [[Sidri|Sidri hunters]] and Eric himself.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 3 3}}

During the battle Eric the Red revealed that Adam was the son of D'ken and a woman from Earth, bred specifically to bring the [[X-Gene]] into the Shi'ar royal family, and that it was always his destiny to rule the Shi'ar Empire. Eric planned to kill Genis-Vell to provoke conflict between Shi'ar and [[Kree Empire]] and use it to overthrow the ruling Empress Lilandra and put Adam on the throne. Adam refused to follow Eric's plan and in a renewed battle Eric seemingly died.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 3 3}}

Finally getting the answers that he searched for, Adam decided to ignore his so-called destiny and continue wandering the Earth.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 3 3}}

===The Burning Blood===
Weeks later Eric the Red and the [[Crystal Claws (Earth-616)|Crystal Claws]] resurfaced in Alaska. In order to find Adam again, they kidnapped [[Philip Summers (Earth-616)|Philip]] and [[Deborah Summers (Earth-616)|Deborah Summers]] to force their grandsons — [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] to help them. Cyclops asked his son Cable to contact Adam to let him know of the situation. Cable found Adam at the farm in [[Iowa (State)|Iowa]] and asked him to meet and talk with Cyclops and Havok in [[Des Moines]]. While heading to Des Moines, Adam was attacked by the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]] [[Hepzibah (Earth-616)|Hepzibah]] and [[Raza Longknife (Earth-616)|Raza Longknife]], who had been sent by Empress Lilandra to apprehend Adam. During the fight, Cyclops and Havok appeared after locating Adam using a tracking device Cable had placed on him. Cyclops and Havok tried to convince Adam to help them, but Adam refused to get involved, and ran away.{{r|X-Men Legends #1}}

When the Starjammers and the Summers brothers caught up with Adam, Adam used his powers on them. While the Starjammers went down, the Summers strangely were unaffected by Adam's power and their powers also had no effect on Adam. Then [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|Corsair]] appeared from the Starjammers' ship and revealed to his sons that Adam was their brother before firing an energy pistol at Adam's head.{{r|X-Men Legends #1|2}}

Christopher thought he killed Adam, but Adam revealed that he was created to withstand a headshot. After talking things over, the Starjammers, the Summers brothers, and Adam worked out a plan. While heading for the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] to meet with Eric the Red, Christopher revealed that the earth woman that D'ken used to create Adam was Christopher's dead wife and mother of Scott and Alex — [[Katherine Summers (Earth-616)|Katherine]], making Adam their maternal half-brother. After arriving on the Blue Area of the Moon, the Starjammers, the Summers brothers, and Adam fought Eric the Red and his followers with Adam taking them out with his powers. Despite rescuing Phillip and Deborah, Christopher felt unease about Adam and called in the [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]]. Adam decided he was tired running and agreed to meet with Empress Lilandra. He proposed a plan to her — erase everyone's memories of his existence and true heritage, and let him live his life back on Earth. Seeing that Adam posed no threat to the Shi'ar Empire, Lilandra agreed. Cyclops and Havok weren't happy to lose their brother shortly after finding him, but still agreed with his plan. [[Sybil (Oracle) (Earth-616)|Oracle]] erased all of their memories and Adam returned back to the farm in Iowa.{{r|X-Men Legends #2}}

===San Francisco===
Years later, when [[Simon Trask (Earth-616)|Simon Trask]] led the Humanity Now! coalition in a march on [[San Francisco]], the then current home of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and many other mutants, in an effort to get the government to pass breeding restrictions on mutants, Adam-X, alongside fellow mutants [[Lorelei Travis (Earth-616)|Lorelei Travis]], [[Erg (Earth-616)|Erg]], [[Litterbug (Earth-616)|Litterbug]], and [[Jeremiah Muldoon (Earth-616)|Meld]] led a counter-protest that quickly turned violent before being interrupted by [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]].{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1}}

After this initial scuffle, Adam-X, Meld, Lorelei, [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]], [[Ben Hammil (Earth-616)|Match]], and [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]] met at [[Dominikos Ioannis Petrakis (Earth-616)|Avalanche]]'s bar, and discussed what actions they should take. Deciding to hold a protest in a public place, the group gathered, openly defying a curfew instituted by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] in his capacity as director of [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]]. Viewing this protest as a good moment to launch his new mutant team, Osborn ordered [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] to lead [[X-Men (Osborn) (Earth-616)|her X-Men]] against the group.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #513}}{{r|Dark Avengers #7}}

Seemingly, he wasn't freed by [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] and sent to the newly built mutant [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] as he was taken in custody for a time by the [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]],{{r|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}} in a plan to proceed with the deportation of any alien element of Earth.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. #1|5}} He returned at some time to San Francisco, unbeknownst to [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steven Rogers]]' intel.{{r|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}}

When [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Kuurth]] attacked [[San Francisco]], Adam helped the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] to stop him, but his powers were ineffective and the results made things worse.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #542}}

===Krakoa===
He was recently seen on the mutant-only nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|X-Force Vol 6 12}} Later on, he took residence on [[Mojoworld]], doing online commentary on various Mojoworld shows.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 3}} On one episode of his show, in response to a fan vote, he shot [[Sofia Mantega (Earth-616)|Wind Dancer]] in the head on live air. On her return to Krakoa she mentioned that she, Adam, [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]], and [[Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse)|Shatterstar]] were there against their will and couldn't escape.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 5}}

[[File:Adam Neramani (Earth-616) and Cain Marko (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 542 001.jpg|thumb|250px|An example of Adam's Electrokinetic Haemopyrokinesis]]

Adam is a [[Homo superior|Mutant]],{{r|X-Force Annual #2}} his abilities include:
*'''Electrokinetic Haemopyrokinesis'''/'''Sanguine Combustion:''' Adam can send an electric surge through oxygenated blood, which leads to ignition of the electrolytes present in blood, causing a person to burn from the inside out.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 39}} To use his power, Adam must first saturate opponent's blood with oxygen. He usually uses various blades to injure the opponent and cause bleeding, thus oxygenated their blood. Also sometime he uses the trigger word "Burn" to activate his power. When employing his power, his eyes glow with a reddish light. The intensity of the burn is variable: he is capable of producing merely a warming sensation,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 39}} to incinerating a person within a matter of seconds.{{r|X-Force Annual #2}} X-Treme can affect multiple targets with his power, the average intensity of which is enough to stun. Doing so, however, takes a tremendous effort, usually leaving Adam in a weakened state.{{r|X-Force Annual #2}} After learning more about his powers, he stated that in theory he hadn't had a limit to how many targets he can affect at the same time.{{r|X-Men Legends #1}}
** '''Self-Burning:''' Adam can also ignite his own blood, which causes a great deal of pain to him, but greatly enhance his speed. He can only use it for short bursts.{{r|X-Men Legends #1}}

As a [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]]/[[Homo superior|Mutant]] hybrid Adam also has physical abilities far superior than those of ordinary people, including:
*'''Enhanced Agility:''' His physical agility is about 10 times that of a normal human.{{r|X-Force Annual #2}}
*'''Enhanced Reflexes:''' His reflexes and ability to move are far superior to both human and Shi'ar.{{r|X-Force Annual #2}}
*'''Enhanced Strength:''' He can lift about 500 lbs.
*'''Enhanced Speed:''' He can cover a few miles in a matter of minutes.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 39}}
*'''Enhanced Eyesight:''' He can see objects at least a mile away with precise clarity.{{r|X-Force Annual #2}}
*'''Enhanced Regeneration'''{{r|X-Men Vol 2 39}}

| Abilities               = Adam is an extremely accomplished fighter. He is also skilled at piloting Shi'ar starships. Other abilities include: tracking, acrobatics, blade combat, and knife throwing.

| body               = 
From {{cl|X-Men Vol 2 39}} on, Adam was intended to be the additional brother to [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] once mentioned cryptically by [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] (Sinister mentioned that he didn't want Cyclops or "[his] brothers" to succumb to the [[Legacy Virus]]), but the plans for this were dropped when [[Fabian Nicieza|Fabian Nicieza]] left Marvel's various X-Titles in 1995. He was supposed to be the son of D'ken and Katherine Anne Summers, the mother of mutants Vulcan, Cyclops, [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], who had been captured by the Shi'ar. While this origin was never confirmed in the comics themselves, Adam is half-human, and Katherine was the only known human woman in Shi'ar space at the time. X-Men #39 (Dec. 1994) featured a story about Adam discovering Philip Summers (father of [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|Christopher Summers]] and grandfather of Cyclops and Havok) in the Alaskan wilderness and feeling an unusual connection to the old man.

Adam-X is presumed to be the son of Katherine Anne Summers by Emperor D'ken based upon a number of suggestions: Adam's blonde hair, the remark made to Cyclops by Sinister (there is uncertainty about whether or not Sinister would have had any knowledge of [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Gabriel Summers]]), the connection felt by Adam towards Phillip, Jean Grey's psionic sensation, and the fact that D'ken kept Katherine as a concubine in his harem prior to ordering her execution.

Nicieza later confirmed that he intended Adam X to be the half-brother of Cyclops and Havok:
"ADAM X was INTENDED to be the illegitimate offspring of D'ken and Kate Summers. Taken from D'ken and raised on a farming planet. BUT--and it's a big but--since I never had the opportunity to tell the entire story, what I intended is worth the screen it's printed on." ''rec.arts.comics.marvel.xbooks, August 1998''

Nicieza left the X-Men office in 1995, and many of his plots were taken in new directions. While it was always intended that Adam X is in fact the "third Summers brother", the idea was seemingly retconned in favor of a new character introduced by [[Ed Brubaker]] in the mini-series [[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]: Vulcan. Yet, like Adam X, Vulcan is connected to the Shi'ar.

However, Adam could still be the brother to Cyclops and Havok mentioned by Sinister (since he was intended to be their half-brother on their mother's side, he would never have been a "Summers brother" despite the fan-term). Sinister mentioned only "your brothers." In addition, Vulcan, in-stasis and believed dead while the Legacy Virus was a problem, could not have been the brother mentioned by Sinister. Also, Sinister never says how many brothers Scott and Alex have, so they may have more than one other brother. Adam, being a brother to the Summers, could explain Sinister's interest in him earlier on. It was finally revealed in {{cl|X-Men Legends #2}} that Adam is the genetically engineered son of Emperor D'ken and Katherine Summers, making him the maternal half brother of Cyclops and Havok.
