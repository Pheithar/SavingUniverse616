| HistoryText             = The Manifestations are a race of Living Fractals from the [[Dimension of Manifestations]]. They are capable of shaping themselves in an infinite manner, serving as Manifestation-Bodies (also called M-Bodies) to [[Abstract Entities|Abstract Beings]], with whom they share a symbiotic bond as they provide power to feed the Manifestations.

The newborn Manifestations are given Finite Beings, such as [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] and the [[Celestials (Race)|Celestials]], to practice on before being allowed to manifest Abstract Beings. Said Finite Beings enlist their services when they cannot physically attend an event.

Although they have no true leader, the Manifestations negotiate through a primary diplomat, or Prime Manifester, who is currently [[Anthropomorpho (Earth-616)|Anthropomorpho]].{{r|Quasar #37}}
