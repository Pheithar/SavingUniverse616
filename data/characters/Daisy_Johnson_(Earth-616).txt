===Early Life===
Daisy Johnson, alias Quake, was at first believed to be a [[Homo superior|mutant]] with seismic (earthquake-producing) abilities. Her powers come from her status as the illegitimate daughter of [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Calvin Zabo]], the supervillain known as Mister Hyde, and a woman with [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] lineage. Before taking the [[Hyde Formula]], Zabo had tampered with his DNA. Calvin had regular "business" with a prostitute named Kim Johnson, who immediately gave her daughter up for adoption. Daisy was named Cory Sutter when she was seven months old, at the time her foster parents adopted her. When Daisy became a teenager and stole two CDs,{{r|Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury #1}} her vibrational powers accidentally awakened as a result of her mother's Inhuman lineage,{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 7}} causing an earthquake.{{r|Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury #1}}

===S.H.I.E.L.D.===
She was taken in by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and interrogated by its longtime executive director, Nick Fury, who told her of her true parentage. He offered her a position with S.H.I.E.L.D. so they could train her in proper use of her powers, in exchange for loyalty to him.{{r|Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury #1}} 

===Secret War===
Daisy held true to his demand, even after the Fury's defection from the agency. She was given a "Level 10" security clearance, the highest level, and proved to be loyal to Fury when he was forced to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. after a number of international warrants were set out for his arrest for his unauthorized [[Secret War]] against [[Latveria]].{{r|Secret War #2}}{{r|Mighty Avengers #12}} Thus, she was taken off active duty by Fury's replacement, [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]].{{r|Secret War #5}}

====Avengers====
Daisy later teamed up with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers #18}} She helped to defeat the powerful mutant rebel leader [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] by inducing a vibration in his brain that made him lose consciousness. On that occasion, she stated that if the Avengers let her join, she would adopt the moniker "Quake".{{r|New Avengers #20}}

===Secret Warriors===
====Secret Invasion====
Daisy was later seen reunited with Nick Fury, in disguise, who gave her orders to recruit the descendants of various villains and heroes in order to assist him against the threat of the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] and their [[Secret Invasion]].{{r|Mighty Avengers #13}} Having taken the name '''Quake''', she attacked the Skrulls during their invasion of [[Manhattan]], alongside her teammates.{{r|{{cl|Secret Invasion Vol 1 3}}-[[Secret Invasion Vol 1 8|8]]}}{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #16|18}}{{r|Secret Invasion: Front Line #3}}{{r|Mighty Avengers #18}}{{r|Thunderbolts #125}}

====Hydra====
Some time after the invasion, Fury revealed to Johnson that he discovered nine shadow bases that didn't show up in the S.H.I.E.L.D. database, not counting the 28 bases he knew about. He revealed that, during a solo recon at a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in Chicago, he discovered that Hydra had been in fact controlling S.H.I.E.L.D. from the beginning.{{r|Secret Warriors #1}} 

The first few missions against Hydra didn't end well. When the Secret Warriors attempted to stop Hydra from kidnapping Psi-Agents, [[Elena Rodr√≠guez (Earth-616)|Slingshot]] lost both her arms to the resurrected [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]].{{r|Secret Warriors #2}} Fury then told Daisy that her team was not ready for this war, and enlisted the help of the newly formed Howling Commandos PMC.{{r|Secret Warriors #3}}

As time went on, Quake and Hellfire grew closer and started a relationship. When Hellfire did not make it out of a mission alive, Quake began to heavily resent Fury.{{r|{{cl|Secret Warriors Vol 1 4}}-[[Secret Warriors Vol 1 8|8]]}} The [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]] attacked the Secret Warriors.{{r|Dark Avengers #9}} Phobos asked Quake to turn off the base's self-destruct, however, she told him that only Fury could do that, and that he wasn't there. The team joined the fight after activating the near-limitless numbers of Fury [[Life-Model Decoys]]. Osborn took pleasure in vaporizing the LMDs, but Quake shattered his helmet with her vibration powers. In response, he pushed her back. Stonewall caught her with his arm, only for Hawkeye to fire explosive arrows at his back. The team escaped through a portal.{{r|Secret Warriors #9|10}} Quake and Fury went to Hotspot, Fury Secret Base #13, to meet with his army. Fury introduced her to Alexander Pierce and Mikel, Fury's son, leaders of Black and Gray teams respectively, as well as PSI-Agent Olivia Hooks and reintroduced Dum Dum. But first, Dum Dum issued for Hooks to scan Daisy's mind. Then, Fury ordered both Hooks and Dum Dum to leave the room; when Daisy asked why he did that, Fury dodged the question. He then told all three team leaders that from now own, their objectives would be intertwined, for now, they have to be ready for the coming storm.{{r|Secret Warriors #11}} Fury informed Quake that his son Mikel had been researching Leviathan; Alexander Pierce was looking at Hydra; and Daisy's team was Fury's personal squad.{{r|Secret Warriors #12}}

Daisy told Fury that she decides what happens on her team, even with the issue of kicking the Druid off it. Fury agreed with her but reminded her that she needed to rethink everything before coming to a decision. Druid was given a notice saying that he's a liability and to go home.{{r|Secret Warriors #13}} Quake was outraged that Fury dismissed the Druid. Talking with her, without the rest of the team, he explained to her that she wasn't going to make a decision, so he did it for her. Druid just didn't have the potential in him to be something greater. As Quake walked out, Hellfire offered to take her for a drink. Quake was venting her anger. Once she calmed down, she asked Hellfire what the "J.T." in his name stood for. He answered that it is James Taylor, as he was named by his mother after a singer/songwriter; he remarked that Quake reminded him of her. Quake then asked how he dealt with Fury. Hellfire admitted that he hated the veteran, but the only reason he stuck around with him was because of her.{{r|Secret Warriors #14}}

At Providence, all of the team, minus Druid, played cards. When both he and Hellfire made unhappy comments towards Quake for dismissing Druid, she admitted that Fury didn't think he was good enough. Everyone but Phobos voted to bring Druid back. Nonetheless, Quake decided to do it anyway. When Fury arrived at Providence, Quake approached him to ask that he reconsider about his decision about Druid, but he gave her a flat no. He told her that she needed to wake up and grow up for what he's preparing her for before walking away. Quake strode into the kitchen, where Phobos, Hellfire, and Eden were betting on the number of marshmallows. Quake pushed Hellfire right against the fridge before kissing him.{{r|Secret Warriors #15}} As Quake took off her telepresence helmet, she then got into a romantic moment with Hellfire.{{r|Secret Warriors #16}} Hellfire tricked Quake into letting him out for a while so he could tell his Hydra contact about Fury's plan to attack the main Hydra base of Gehenna. Quake and the team went to Gehenna to confront Hydra.{{r|Secret Warriors #20}} Baron von Strucker had the team cornered and expected his nemesis to beg for the lives of his proteges, but Fury's response was three bullets headed for Strucker's face.{{r|Secret Warriors #21}}

[[File:Secret Warriors Vol 1 22 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
Shocked at the death of Phobos at the hands of Gorgon, Daisy brought down the entire cavern around them while the team retreated. Fury knew Hellfire was a traitor and cared for by Daisy. When asked by Fury if he loved her, Hellfire confessed that it was more than anything. However, Fury stated that if Daisy was holding his hand, things would be different, and he's not Daisy, and let him go. Fury then escaped, lying to Daisy that Hellfire didn't make it.{{r|Secret Warriors #22}}

Druid was expunged from the team by Fury. But later returned with [[Jonathan Garrett (Earth-616)|John Garrett]] to rescue Quake and the team from [[Gehenna (Hydra Base)|Gehenna]]. The aftermath of the mission resulted in the Caterpillar team being deactivated, as Eden was in a medically induced coma and Quake was distraught from Hellfire's betrayal.{{r|Secret Warriors #23}}{{r|Secret Warriors #26}} Jake found Daisy in [[Hawaii (State)|Hawaii]], suntanning, and passed her an undisclosed message. Quake read Fury's letter, which conveyed his regret to her and asked for forgiveness. Inspired, she and Druid reunited the Secret Warriors and joined up with Team Black and the Howling Commandos. Once they were assembled, Quake asked everyone if they are ready to save the world.{{r|Secret Warriors #28}}

====Siege====
Daisy worked alongside the Avengers, [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]], and [[Secret Avengers (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]], as they took down [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] during [[Siege]]. Daisy along with the others were powered up by the [[Norn Stones]] thanks to [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]], in order to battle the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]].{{r|Siege Vol 1 #2|4}}{{r|New Avengers #62}}{{r|Mighty Avengers #35}}{{r|Siege: Secret Warriors #1}}{{r|Siege: Embedded #4}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 1}}

===Fear Itself===
Daisy went to [[Sweden]] to find and stop Sin. There she found a castle where [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Sin]] was staying.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 16}} Daisy took down the castle not realizing that [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]], [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]], [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]], and [[Victoria Hand (Earth-616)|Victoria Hand]] were inside battling [[Max Lohmer (Earth-616)|Master Man]] and the [[Exiles (Earth-616)|Exiles]]. They escaped the castle unharmed and had Daisy to thank for saving the team.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 #19|20}}

===Reactivation of S.H.I.E.L.D.===
Steve Rogers decided to reactivate [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] with Johnson as director. She also joined the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] main team for some time.{{r|Battle Scars #4}}

Daisy and the Avengers battled Hydra as they made a play for H.A.M.M.E.R. as Norman Osborn tried to take back the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 22|23}} The team then battled Norman as he became the new [[Super-Adaptoid]].{{r|Avengers Vol 4 24}}

Daisy recruited [[Nicholas Fury, Jr. (Earth-616)|Nick Fury, Jr.]] and [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-616)|Phil Coulson]] into S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Battle Scars #6}}

===The Avengers===
Daisy joined the the Avengers and, working together, tried to stop the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 24}} S.H.I.E.L.D. try to warn [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]] about a bomb.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 5}} She then had to deal with the [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]].{{r|Avengers Vol 4 28}} She arrested and questioned the X-Men.{{r|AvX: Consequences #3}}

Daisy came looking for Captain America, but he was on a mission in the [[Microverse]].{{r|Avengers Vol 4 33}} Quake summoned all the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D. to clear out [[Central Park]] while awaiting the founding Avengers' return. Maria Hill chastised her for exercising her authority before Hawkeye interrupted, asking if there was a plan. Hill said they needed [[Pym Particles]] to go to the Microverse. Wonder Man then turned up with an orb of the particles, which he used on himself before anyone could stop him. Quake and Hill shared small talk before the founding Avengers returned. But their joy was interrupted by [[Gouzar (Earth-616)|Gouzar]]'s sudden giant appearance. The Avengers fought hard and well to subdue him before Giant-Man shrunk him back to the Microverse. After the incident, Quake and Maria left the team.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 34}}

===Secret Avengers===
After A.I.M., who had recently established their own nation in [[Barbuda]], stole an [[Iron Patriot Armor Model 1|Iron Patriot Armor]] during the confusion in a conflict they incited against S.H.I.E.L.D. at a weapons expo,{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 3}} the Secret Avengers, with the addition of [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], were given the task to kill [[Andrew Forson (Earth-616)|Andrew Forson]].{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 4}} After they seemingly succeeded in their mission to kill Forson, Quake was suspended indefinitely for breaking the protocols, as Forson was the leader of a U.N. member nation. Maria Hill was then put in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. once more.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 6|7}} As no action against Johnson could be authorized until the UN Security Council had convened, Johnson took advantage. With the help of [[Eden Fesi (Earth-616)|Manifold]], she subjected herself to the similar treatment Tony Stark underwent to erase his memories after Norman Osborn became the director of H.A.M.M.E.R., and deleted from her brain part of her memories S.H.I.E.L.D. could get access to. Daisy later went under the radar, similar to Nick Fury, and recruited the [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]] for a special mission.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 9}} Both Daisy and Bucky met [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Bobbi Morse]] when she went under the radar as well.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 16}}

===Encounter with Hyde===
Daisy started working for S.H.I.E.L.D. once again. She was tasked with retrieving her father from [[Portugal]] after her body started rejecting her powers, causing her bones to splinter and even shatter. Hyde was taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. safe-house in Spain, where he was forced to cooperate and start developing a cure for Daisy's condition. Zabo started feeling affection toward his daughter, and, once he managed to cure her, he tried to inject her with the Hyde formula claiming it would protect her. Phil Coulson, one of the agents overseeing Hydra, injected himself with the formula to defend her, and fought against Mr. Hyde long enough for Quake to recover from the treatment and cause an earthquake that swallowed Hyde into the ground.{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D.
