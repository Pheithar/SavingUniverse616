===Early Life===
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker was born in the late 19th century to a Prussian noble family who had relocated to Strucker Castle in [[Bavaria]] following the Franco-Prussian War. Wolfgang became a Heidelberg fencing champion, and was disfigured by facial scars.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #2}}

===World War I===
Wolfgang fought for [[German Empire|Germany]] during [[World War I]], during which he first encountered the [[Momentary Princess]] in 1916, which was fated to appear and disappear at regular intervals of time. As he touched it, he saw his future as the leader of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]].{{r|Gambit Vol 3 10}}

===Nazi Party===
When [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in Germany in the 1930s, von Strucker joined the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi Party]].

In 1936, he and [[Nikolaus Geist (Earth-616)|Nikolaus Geist]] allied with the Egyptian mentalist [[Amahl Farouk (Earth-616)|Amahl Farouk]] a.k.a. the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]], in an attempt to dispute the lineage of [[England]]'s royal family and install a new king who would be sympathetic to their cause.{{r|X-Men: True Friends #1}} Their plot was thwarted by the Canadian adventurer [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]] and the time-traveling members of [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]].{{r|{{cl|X-Men: True Friends Vol 1 2}}-[[X-Men: True Friends Vol 1 3|3]]}}

In 1937, Strucker was head of the Reich's armaments command.{{r|Astonishing Tales: Dominic Fortune Vol 1 3}} Later that year, he was sent to America to assassinate Senator Fulton, but he was foiled by brigand-for-hire [[Duvid Fortunov (Earth-616)|Dominic Fortune]].{{r|Hulk! #23}}

===World War II===
As [[World War II]] started, Strucker rose through the ranks and became wing commander of the [[Death's Head Squadron (Nazi) (Earth-616)|Death's Head Squadron]]. Von Strucker referred to himself as "wing commander of the Fuhrer's Death-Head Squadron".{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 5}}

Strucker and the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] tried to invade the isolationist African nation of [[Wakanda]] during World War II in hopes of recovering some [[Vibranium]]. [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] teamed up with the chieftain [[Azzuri (Earth-616)|Black Panther]]. The two heroes reluctantly worked together to expel the invading forces.{{r|{{cl|Black Panther/Captain America: Flags of Our Fathers Vol 1 1}}-[[Black Panther/Captain America: Flags of Our Fathers Vol 1 4|4]]}}

Sometime before 1941, Strucker created his personal paramilitary force, [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], keeping its formation secret from [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Hitler]] and the Nazi Party.{{r|{{cl|Wolverine: Origins Vol 1 18}}-[[Wolverine: Origins Vol 1 19|19]]}}

In 1941 Strucker was contacted by the cabal of ninjas known as the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]], which had just broken a longtime agreement with the crime mastermind [[Romulus (Earth-616)|Romulus]] and wanted to form new alliances.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #16}}{{r|Wolverine: Origins #18}} In order to gain the Hand's loyalty, Strucker approached and captured young Russian operative [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Natalia Romanova]], bringing her to [[Madripoor]] as a gift for the ninjas, who were trying to turn the girl into the cabal's Master Assassin. However Strucker was not aware that Natalia was secretly an agent of Romulus sent to kill the [[Jonin (WWII) (Earth-616)|Jonin]] of the Hand, and while she was ready to accomplish her mission during the Master Assassin ritual, [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]], another agent of Romulus and Natalia's friend, interrupted the ceremony and killed the Jonin, avoiding making Natalia a killer again. [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Ivan Petrovich Bezukhov (Earth-616)|Ivan Petrovich]] helped Logan fight the Hand, while Strucker escaped in the battle's chaos.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #16}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #268}}

Later in 1941, Strucker conducted a secret Hydra operation in [[Tunisia]], using as a cover another Nazi operation on the same place.{{r|{{cl|Wolverine: Origins Vol 1 17}}-[[Wolverine: Origins Vol 1 19|19]]}} After Captain America, his sidekick [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky]], and Logan entered into the Hydra headquarters and killed a [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Impersonator) (Earth-616)|Strucker impersonator]], the real Strucker's location was discovered by Logan, who was ordered by [[Seraph (Earth-616)|Seraph]], a Madripoor agent of Romulus, not to kill him due to new agreements between him and Romulus.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #19}} Captured by the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Army]], Strucker was later freed by Logan and later rescued by his Nazi ally [[Heinrich Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], arrived in Tunisia with support troops.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #20}}

Later in 1941, Strucker invaded [[Latveria]], seeking to use the Sturm-FÃ¥nger ("Storm-Catcher") to control cosmic energies; the device was wrecked by time-traveling members of [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]]. They found Strucker and his machine, so [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] quickly destroyed it. [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] then knocked out Strucker and they headed off to find [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]'s [[Time Platform]].{{r|X-Force #64}}

Strucker sought to quash the [[Howling Commandos (Earth-616)|Howling Commandos]] by utterly defeating their leader, [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] and issued a challenge to meet him in a one-on-one battle on the island of [[Norsehaven]]. Fury was determined to battle Strucker, but Captain Sawyer refused to allow him to do so. Unwilling to back down, Fury sneaked to the island, disobeying direct orders not to do so. On the island, Strucker challenged him to a duel with wooden swords. When he suggested a toast before the battle Fury agreed, unaware that his drink was drugged. Although Fury was able to hold his own against Strucker, once the drugs began to kick in, he was quickly defeated. This defeat was photographed by Nazi soldiers to use in propaganda. Fury was then dumped near his base. When Sawyer found out what happened once the battle became front-page news in the Nazi newspapers, he stripped Fury of his rank reducing him to a private. The Howlers were then dropped in West Germany where they were to destroy a Nazi rocket base in the town of [[Dortstadt]]. When they attacked the rocket base they found that it was under the command of Baron Strucker. Seeking a rematch, Fury agreed to another duel; but when [[Dino Manelli (Earth-616)|Dino]] realized that Strucker was drugging another beverage, he tipped off Fury. This time Fury easily defeated the Baron in combat and his comrades took photographs to counter the propaganda of Fury's defeat before fleeing the ruins of the base.{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 5}}{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 9}}

In 1942, the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]], as part of the [[Thule Society (Earth-616)|Thule Society]], attempted to perform a magical ritual involving [[Homo mermanus|Atlanteans]]. Once the ritual was complete, something fell from the sky, but not at the Skull's castle. The Skull and Baron Strucker traveled to [[Antarctica]], followed by the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]], determined to have whatever fell. The Invaders were then suddenly attacked by a demon. They defeated the demon with the Skull's unintentional help. The Invaders then left, thinking that they foiled the Skull's plan. The Skull told Strucker that they had the unidentified object in a box bound for the Fuhrer. It was a lie, as the object they were looking for was the [[Hammer of Skadi]], which no one could lift.{{r|Fear Itself: Book of the Skull #1}}

Hitler later had Strucker start a new squad based on Fury's own, called the [[Blitzkrieg Squad (Earth-616)|Blitzkrieg Squad]], and set a trap for the Commandos. The trap was a fake missile base made to look real from the outside. However, the Commandos escaped, further embarrassing Strucker.{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 14}}{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 20}}{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 22}}{{r|{{cl|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 28}}-[[Sgt. Fury Vol 1 29|29]]}}{{r|Sgt. Fury Annual #1}}{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 58}}

Captain America and [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] battled Strucker and the Thule Society during WWII. The Thule unleashed the [[Kraken (Mask)|Kraken]] a weapon of Atlantean origin and ungodly power.{{r|Captain America and Namor #635.1}}

He fought [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]{{r|Captain America #616}} and the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]] and several other wartime heroes, losing every time.{{r|Invaders #30}}{{r|{{cl|All-New Invaders Vol 1 1}}-[[All-New Invaders Vol 1 2|2]]}}

While on vacation in [[Berlin]], Baron Strucker witnessed Thor's attack on the Chancellery,{{r|Invaders #30}} after which he followed a bandaged man through a portal.{{r|Marvel Universe #1}} Realizing he had traveled decades into the future, Strucker stole some history books about the end of [[World War II]].{{r|Marvel Universe #2}} He encountered the time machine's creator [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], who allowed him to return to the past, not believing that Strucker could win the war even with the knowledge he had obtained.{{r|Marvel Universe #3}}

In 1943, angered by the Baron's many losses, [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Hitler]] ordered Strucker to destroy the [[French Resistance (Earth-616)|French Resistance]] in the town of [[Cherbeaux]] or, if the plan failed, to destroy the town itself. Strucker wanted to eliminate the resistance in the territories near Cherbeaux, trying to avoid the town's destruction, but the Howling Commandos arrived in time to free the resistance members. Hitler ordered Strucker to set the explosives to destroy Cherbeaux, but he came face-to-face with Fury, who possessed a more powerful explosive that could even kill Strucker himself. He decided to let the Cherbeaux population free, wanting a last battle with his arch-enemy. When the Commandos finished the evacuation, Fury fought Strucker while the town was being destroyed around them. Fury lost Strucker under the ruins, while Hitler wanted him killed by the [[Geheime Staatspolizei (Earth-616)|Gestapo]].{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 29}}{{r|Fury #1}}

At that point the Red Skull, who foresaw Hitler's fall from power, helped Strucker escape Germany, sending him to [[Japan]], where the Skull had secretly created an organization composed by several underground Japanese societies, including the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]], and fugitive members of [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi Germany]] and [[Imperial Japan (Earth-616)|Imperial Japan]].{{r|Fury #1}}{{r|Marvel Universe #1}}{{r|Secret Warriors #1|; [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] Timeline}}{{r|Secret Warriors #12}}

In Japan, he joined the Skull's organization, renamed it ''Hydra'',{{r|Marvel Atlas #1|; [[Japan]]'s entry}} killed its [[Supreme Hydra (Japanese) (Earth-616)|leader]] and seized control of the organization.{{r|Capt. Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders Vol 1 #4}}{{r|Fury #1}}{{r|Marvel Universe #1}}{{r|Secret Warriors #1|; Hydra Timeline}} As the [[Supreme Hydra]], Strucker created the Hydra Base Tsunami, better known as [[Hydra Island]].{{r|{{cl|Capt. Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders Vol 1 2}}-[[Capt. Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders Vol 1 4|4]]}}{{r|Secret Warriors #1|; Hydra Timeline}}

After having seen the power of Strucker's newborn Hydra, the new [[Jonin (Earth-616)|Jonin]] of the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] tried to unify the two organizations, introducing the occult arts and worship of the [[Beast (Demon) (Earth-616)|Beast]] inside Hydra. Strucker, who knew that occultism had previously driven Hitler near to madness, fought the Jonin, winning the battle that would keep separated Hydra and the Hand for some time.{{r|Daredevil #295}}

Baron Strucker soon came in to conflict with [[Simon Savage (Earth-616)|Captain Simon Savage]] and the [[Leatherneck Raiders (Earth-616)|Leatherneck Raiders]].{{r|Capt. Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders Vol 1 #2}} The crew was captured,{{r|Capt. Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders Vol 1 #3}} but they were able to fight their way to the base just in time to rescue their men from a firing squad, but they were all able to escape, with Hydra Island partially destroyed.{{r|Capt. Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders Vol 1 #4}}{{r|Marvel Universe #1}}

At some point, he acquired the [[Spear of Imhotep]].{{r|Secret Warriors #25}}

Strucker later decided to regain Hitler's favor, drugging Fury after having him captured in [[Africa]], and offering Hitler the drug's formula. However, Fury was freed by the Howling Commandos.{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 112}}{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 114|115}}

He finally returned in Germany, seemingly operating as a loyal Nazi but secretly leading Hydra behind the scenes. Hydra later obtained the Japanese submarine known as the ''[[Dragon of Death]]'' and used it as its new base of operations; Hydra later tried to build an atomic bomb by using knowledge from the future obtained by Strucker in a time-travel with [[Time Platform|Doctor Doom's Time Machine]], but they were defeated by the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]].{{r|{{cl|Marvel Universe Vol 1 1}}-[[Marvel Universe Vol 1 3|3]]}}

Under Strucker's leadership, the Thule Society and Hydra started merging, quickly becoming the one and the same.{{r|{{cl|Captain America: Hail Hydra Vol 1 1}}-[[Captain America: Hail Hydra Vol 1 2|2]]}}{{r|According to {{cl|Captain America: Hail Hydra #1}}'s recap page, ''Thule Society'' has also been considered to be one of the many aliases of Hydra.}}

As the Thule Society's leader, Strucker worked in 1944 with Dr. Geist to create an army of [[Auferstehungs Corps (Earth-616)|Super-Soldiers]].{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #1}} This project, named the ''Infinitas Agenda'', continued also after the Thule Society was absorbed into the modern [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]].{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #2|5}}

In 1944, Strucker encountered the [[Gnobians]], a benevolent race of empathic extraterrestrials who had crashed near [[Gruenstadt]].{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 4}} Realizing what their technology could do for Hydra, Strucker befriended the naÃ¯ve creatures and killed the population of Gruenstadt to cover his tracks.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 5}} The Howlers arrived, too late to prevent the tragedy, but fatally wounded Strucker. The Gnobians healed Strucker with their powers, but they went insane from absorbing some of his hate-filled psyche in the process. Strucker fled their crashed ship, taking discs of their information to his scientists.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 6}}

In 1945, as the Reich fell, Strucker placed [[Wilhelm Lohmer (Earth-616)|Master Man]] and [[Julia Koenig (Earth-616)|Warrior Woman]] under suspended animation, trying to preserve them for the future.{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #10}} He also preserved the Red Skull when he was buried alive in his bunker after a battle against Captain America.{{r|Marvel Universe #1}}

===After World War II===
Since Hydra needed more finances, Strucker abducted [[Gabrielle Haller (Earth-616)|Gabby Haller]], who had a map leading to a fortune in lost Nazi gold hidden within her mind, but Haller was defended by her friends, the mutants [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] and [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Erik Magnus]], and Magnus took the gold for his own purposes.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #161}}{{r|Secret Warriors #1|; Hydra Timeline}}

Satanist and fourth richest person in the world, [[Elsbeth von Strucker (Earth-616)|Elsbeth von Strucker]] married Strucker and started funding Hydra in 1957,{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 23}} seemingly incorporating her own agenda about the [[Sickly Ones (Earth-616)|Sickly Ones]],{{r|The founding fathers of the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]].}} entities that had waited for a chosen one for almost four billion years.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 26}}

Strucker then reorganized and began to diversify Hydra, repositioning the organization towards global domination.{{r|Secret Warriors #1|; Hydra Timeline}}

===The [[Zodiac (Great Wheel) (Earth-616)|Wheel]] of [[Fury Secret Base 7|Pieta]]===
In 1961, Shield's Grandmaster [[Leonardo da Vinci (Earth-616)|Leonardo da Vinci]] organized several important people in the espionage world in a loose partnership known as the [[Zodiac (Great Wheel) (Earth-616)|Great Wheel of Zodiac]]. Led by Da Vinci himself as [[Aries]], the Wheel included Baron Strucker, [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick]] and [[Jacob Fury (Earth-616)|Jake Fury]], [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]]'s Grandmaster [[Shoji Soma (Earth-616)|Shoji Soma]], [[Leviathan (Earth-616)|Leviathan]]'s founders [[Viktor Uvarov (Earth-616)|Viktor Uvarov]] and [[Vasili Dassaiev (Earth-616)|Vasili Dassiev]], [[Thomas Davidson (Earth-616)|Thomas Davidson]], [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Timothy Dugan]], [[Jonathan Garrett (Earth-616)|John Garrett]], [[Cornelius van Lunt (Earth-616)|Cornelius van Lunt]] and Spear's agent [[Daniel Whitehall (Earth-616)|Daniel Whitehall]].{{r|Secret Warriors #25}}{{r|Daniel Whitehall's Spear membership is possibly recalled in {{cl|Captain America: Steve Rogers #16}}, where [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] mentions the Great Wheel to be connected with ''Shield, Spear and Leviathan''; however, Hydra and Hand have been not mentioned.}}

The Great Wheel accomplished several missions for Aries, including the discover of [[Brood (Race)|The Brood]]'s alien technology in [[Egypt]], [[Zargos Mountains]], and [[France]].{{r|Secret Warriors #25}} In France, the Fury brothers and Thomas Davidson found the Brood's replicant technology, which originated the first two [[Life-Model Decoy|Life-Model Decoys]], the ones of [[Jacob Fury (LMD) (Earth-616)|Jake Fury]] and [[Thomas Davidson (LMD) (Earth-616)|Thomas Davidson]].{{r|Secret Warriors #26}} However, Uvarov and Dassiev started operating behind the scenes using the alien technology for Leviathan's own purposes, betraying the Great Wheel after having learned from Davidson how to activate Pieta's secret protocols. As a consequence, the Wheel later disbanded.{{r|Secret Warriors #25}}

''"We are committed. If we lose one hand, two more will take his place.''<br>
-- '''[[Shoji Soma (Earth-616)|Grandmaster Shoji Soma]]'''{{r|Secret Warriors #25}}<br>

After the breaking of the Great Wheel, Strucker and Soma's Hand allied to attack [[Leviathan (Earth-616)|Leviathan]], and Strucker used the [[Spear of Imhotep]] to stab [[Viktor Uvarov (Earth-616)|Viktor Uvarov]]; the Spear's fate after the battle is unknown.{{r|Secret Warriors #25}}

In 1965,{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 9|; [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum-Dum Dugan's story]]}} [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Director [[Rick Stoner (Earth-616)|Rick Stoner]] was assassinated by Hydra agents under Strucker's orders, and Nick Fury was selected by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] as the new director.{{r|Fury #1}}{{r|Strange Tales #135}}{{r|Secret Warriors #1|; Hydra Timeline}}

===Hydra inside S.H.I.E.L.D.===
Soon after having become director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury recruited former Great Wheel member [[Thomas Davidson (Earth-616)|Thomas Davidson]] to built the organization's new technological setup based on the old Leviathan's system, themselves based on original [[Fury Secret Base 7|Pieta]]'s protocols. Then, Fury sent the [[Thomas Davidson (LMD) (Earth-616)|duplicate]] of Davidson created by Brood technology in France as an undercover member in Hydra. This way Strucker learned from "Davidson" how to have access into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s systems and used the protocols to secretly observe the organization's activities; Strucker also had "Davidson" building the entire Hydra's technology spying system, also based on Pieta's protocols. This way, the real Davidson easily had access to Hydra systems, and Fury used them to observe Hydra while Hydra was observing S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Secret Warriors #26}}

===The Rise of Hydra===
Strucker and [[Adelicia von Krupp (Earth-616)|Baroness Adelicia von Krupp]] once captured the [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|C.I.A.]]'s Agent Ten, Logan, but he was rescued by agents [[Richard Parker (Earth-616)|Richard Parker]] and [[Mary Parker (Earth-616)|Mary Parker]].{{r|Untold Tales of Spider-Man #-1}}

Strucker, as the [[Supreme Hydra]], disguised himself as "Don Antonio Cabellero", and invited S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new director Nick Fury to a party at the ruins of [[Karnopolis]], in the [[Sahara Desert]].{{r|Strange Tales #150}} Agent Fury was captured and revealed his plans to use the [[Overkill Horn]] to detonate all stockpiles of nuclear weapons worldwide. Fury managed to escape with a Hydra jet, not realizing it was a ruse, as the Overkill Horn is onboard the plane.{{r|Strange Tales #151}} Fury was able to signal S.H.I.E.L.D. and the plane was not shot down. Fury managed to turn the plane around, and discovered where the Overkill Horn was hidden.{{r|Strange Tales #152}} Strucker donned a new disguise, that of "Agent Bronson", a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. "Bronson" arrived at the [[Helicarrier]] just in time to join the team racing to help Fury. After helping capture several Hydra thugs, "Bronson" gained Fury's confidence.{{r|Strange Tales #153}} While the [[AUTOFAC]] computer worked out the true identity of the Supreme Hydra, Fury planned to have Bronson transport [[Laura Brown (Earth-616)|Laura Brown]] to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s West coast HQ. Laura suspected Bronson may be the Supreme Hydra himself, and her suspicions were confirmed by AUTOFAC, but before she could pass on the info, Bronson overpowered her. Fury just barely managed to beat The Dreadnought, but was unable to find Laura, and AUTOFAC named her as the Supreme Hydra.{{r|Strange Tales #153}} Laura is found hidden away in the computer room, wearing a Hydra outfit.{{r|Strange Tales #153}} Bronson wa set to take Laura to a medical facility in the "Dyna-Soar", a brand-new aircraft whose design is based and improved upon from the captured Hydra saucer. No sooner does he depart than Fury's quarters are blasted to bits, apparently killing him. Bronson changed course and headed for "Hydra Island", then resumed his guise as Supreme Hydra. He then announced to the world that he had placed a "[[Death Spore]]" bomb on board the Helicarrier, which would unleash a deadly plague upon the entire Earth and it could not be deactivated. Any country that surrendered within one hour would be spared its effects. He also planned to stage a fake "trial" for Laura, as an example to all who would defy him. Unknown to him, Fury was alive, having suspected Bronson from the start, and was hiding onboard the Dyna-Soar, in order to discover Hydra's plans and the location of their base. But after taking on several Hydra thugs, Fury was captured, and on awakening, discovered the true identity of the Supreme Hydra to be none other than Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker.{{r|Strange Tales #154}} Strucker announced that the impregnable dome over Hydra Island would keep them safe from the "Death Spore" plague, and planned to use Fury's body as the basis for an army of Hydra androids to "police" the world, once he was killed by the Alpha Ray beam. But Fury escaped. As S.H.I.E.L.D. searched the Helicarrier for the bomb with no result, Fury, "playing it by ear", took on one group of Hydra thugs after another, until Strucker faced him one-on-one. Thanks to his deadly "[[Satan Claw]]", Strucker gained the upper hand, and it looked like it might be the end.{{r|Strange Tales #157}} Strucker used the "Satan Claw" to electrify the floor, until Fury managed to get it off Strucker's hand. But surrounded by Hydra thugs, Fury dived into a pit of water, and after not emerging for 5 minutes, was presumed dead. Fury used an oxygen pellet to wait out the thugs, then raced ahead of Strucker. When the Hydra thugs entered the room, they discovered two Struckers. One of them was revealed to be wearing a mask, panicked, and wound up incinerated in an "Alpha-Particle Reactor Cube". The other ordered Laura put aboard the Dyna-Soar, and he took off from Hydra Island, despite the imminent detonation of The Death Spore bomb. Fury used Strucker's "face-changing gizmo" to disguise both himself and Strucker, to fool the guards. He also revealed that when he left the Helicarrier, he brought the bomb with him, even though at the time he didn't know what it was. It detonated, and thanks to the impenetrable dome, only Hydra Island and all within are wiped off the face of the Earth.{{r|Strange Tales #158}}

A [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Android) (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]] android created by [[Samuel Saxon (Earth-616)|Machinesmith]], who believed himself to be the original, attacked [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] by employing [[Batroc's Brigade (Earth-616)|Batroc's Brigade]] and a false [[Bucky (Impostor) (Earth-616)|Bucky]].{{r|Captain America #130}} This Strucker was eventually captured by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and self-destructed after meeting with Nick Fury.{{r|Captain America #247|248}}

A second [[Wolfgang von Strucker (LMD) (Earth-616)|Life-Model Decoy]] of Baron Strucker appeared as the head of Hydra. He tried to defeat Captain America and the Howling Commandos by using a [[Samuel Sawyer (LMD) (Earth-616)|LMD]] of [[Samuel Sawyer (Earth-616)|Captain Sam Sawyer]]; Strucker, who was revealed to be a LMD, and his Hydra were defeated by the heroes.{{r|Captain America #273|274}}

===Strucker's Return===
After having seen Hydra's decline under Werner von Strucker's leadership, the Red Skull sent three agents to resurrect the real Baron Wolfgang von Strucker using his [[Death Spore Virus]] in the former [[Hydra Island]].{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 20|21}} Successfully resurrected, Strucker immediately started to reorganize Hydra by killing the leaders of the several splinter cells and uniting them to create a brand new Hydra.{{r|{{cl|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 22}}-[[Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 23|23]]}} Later, Strucker and his newly recruited lieutenants assaulted [[New York City]] and destroyed [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters]] in [[Manhattan]], killing 1500 agents in the act.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 25|27}} Hydra lieutenants later ran an operation at [[Arctic Circle]], but they were stopped by Fury's agents.{{r|{{cl|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 28}}-[[Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 29|29]]}}

Three of Baron Strucker's genetically engineered deadly assassins; [[Sathan (Earth-616)|Sathan]], [[Nicos Pelletier (Earth-616)|Guillotine]], and [[Cassandra Romulus (Earth-616)|Lt. Romulus]], escaped and went on a murder spree. Daredevil teamed with Nick Fury to hunt them down. Hydra bounty hunters [[Ron Takimoto (Earth-616)|Ron Takimoto]], [[Dakini (Earth-616)|Dakini]], and [[Carlton Stricklan (Earth-616)|Carl Stricklan]] were sent to capture them. Nick Fury, [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]], and Captain America became involved in the hunt, and the hunters were killed, Stricklan went rogue, and only Guillotine and Romulus returned to Hydra. Strucker had achieved his true goal to analyze United States superhumans.{{r|Daredevil Annual #7}}

Baron Strucker took up the identity of Colonel Strang to secretly to purchase control over WFET, a television station owned by [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Wilson Fisk]] aka the Kingpin.{{r|Daredevil #292}} When S.H.I.E.L.D became involved and they tipped off Daredevil, who then let word reach the streets.{{r|Daredevil #293}} Fisk thought Hydra was his enemy and turned on them, only to have Hydra steal nearly all of his money, destroy his businesses, and help to end his reign as the Kingpin.{{r|Daredevil #298|299}} When the Kingpin's assets were divided amongst criminal faction, this included the Strucker's children [[Werner von Strucker (Earth-616)|Werner von Strucker]] and [[Fenris (Earth-616)|Fenris]]. Baron Strucker reconnected with the Hand, who sent their magical warrior [[Izanami (The Hand) (Earth-616)|Izanami]] to thin the competition.{{r|Daredevil #307}} Strucker also posed as Snakeskin, bodyguard to Werner who acted as the mastermind of the new Hydra. However, Strucker killed Werner for being unworthy as his successor.{{r|Daredevil #326|332}}

During the final showdown between Strucker's Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury and his agents were brought to [[Hydrabase]] in [[Iceland]]. Fury and his allies defeated Hydra, Strucker escaped, and agent [[Kathleen Neville (Earth-616)|Kate Neville]] was killed on the mission.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 45|47}}

Baron Strucker and the Red Skull relaxed in their posh [[Washington, D.C.]] exclusive club. The party was spoiled when the Skull discovered someone had attacked [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]]'s compound and destroyed all of the Red Skull body-double clones.{{r|Captain America #387}} The Red Skull held a meeting with his Division Chiefs, including Strucker who updated him on their recent activities.{{r|Captain America #394}}

Baron Strucker sent the [[Department of Occult Armaments (Earth-616)|Department of Occult Armaments]] against the [[Nightstalkers (Earth-616)|Nightstalkers]].{{r|Nightstalkers #2}}{{r|Nightstalkers #4}}

Baron Strucker faced rivals within Hydra, and had to deal with splinter groups such as the [[Genesis Coalition (Earth-616)|Genesis Coalition]].{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #9}} He hired the mercenary [[Next Wave (Earth-616)|Next Wave]] to bring them down; they were helped by [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]] and the [[Wild Pack (Earth-616)|Wild Pack]].{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #11}} Strucker planned an attack on the [[United Nations]],{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #15}} but by then, Fury had found proof that Strucker was Hydra's leader.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #16}} He tracked him to his base in [[Iceland]], where Strucker killed [[Kate Neville (Earth-616)|Kate Neville]] before Fury's very eyes.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #17}} Fury and Strucker fought each other on the side of a mountain, and the fight ended with Fury cutting off Strucker's right hand to make him fall towards apparent death.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #25}}

Baron Strucker sent his Hydra Agents to retrieve Anomaly Gem fragment from [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]]. He tried to stop them but were taken prisoner.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #129}} Strucker planned to use the gem as a power source. He used the other fragment he had a fused them together. Iron Fist escaped and tried to stop him but the energy feedback threw him against the wall.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #130}} Strucker discovered that gem actually produced a portal to another dimension. Iron Fist managed to grab the fragments and escape from Strucker's facility.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #131}}

<!-- This Strucker was a LMD/clone, according to Marvel Chronology Project and the Handbooks
Baron Strucker attempted to buy the Guardian suit and hundreds of Groundhog suits. When it seemed likely that [[Department H (Earth-616)|Department H]] was to be closed, [[Gary Cody (Earth-616)|Gary Cody]], on the promptings of a Hydra agent planted within Department H, was convinced to sell these Groundhog suits to Strucker. Strucker sent Hydra troops equipped with these suits to kidnap the X-Men. [[James Hudson (Earth-616)|James Hudson]] activated [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] to retrieve the X-Men.{{r|X-Men and Alpha Flight Vol 2 1}} Working together they attacked Hydra. When the tide of battle turned, the agent who had convinced Cody to sell the suits turned on Strucker and asked: "How many defeats does it take, to prove oneself superior"? Strucker replied, "As many times as it takes." Strucker then shot the agent before the agent could shoot him. After the defeat of the Hydra troops, Strucker teleported himself to safety through the use of a wrist device. Strucker was responsible for the death of [[Marrina Smallwood (Earth-616)|Marrina Smallwood]]'s son.{{r|X-Men and Alpha Flight Vol 2 2}} -->

Baron Strucker planned to use Nanites to control key people such as [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Gyrich]] of the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities (Earth-616)|Commission on Superhuman Activities]].{{r|Citizen V and the V-Battalion #2}} Henry Gyrich nearly killed every superhuman on Earth with the nanites. Strucker's involvement was finally discovered by the [[V-Battalion (Earth-616)|V-Battalion]], who thwarted his plans. [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Helmut Zemo]] was revealed to have murdered Strucker's daughter [[Andrea von Strucker (Earth-616)|Andrea]].{{r|Citizen V and the V-Battalion #3}}

[[File:Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616) from New Thunderbolts Vol 1 1 001.jpg|right|thumb|As Thunderbolts' financer]]
After having married to the Hydra's Chief Financier [[Elsbeth von Strucker (Earth-616)|Elsbeth]],{{r|{{cl|Wolverine Vol 3 22}}-[[Wolverine Vol 3 23|23]]}} Strucker secretly became the financial banker of a reconstituted team of [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]],{{r|New Thunderbolts #1}} even though the Thunderbolts, when commanded by Baron Zemo, used their knowledge of Hydra's organization to inflict severe damage and build up their reputation as heroes.{{r|New Thunderbolts #2}}

===Clone===
Unknown to Wolfgang, his wife Elsbeth and her bodyguard and lover [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] (the leader of the Asian death-cult of the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]]) created an obedient [[Glossary:Clone|clone]] of [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Clone) (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]] to use as a pawn in their plans.{{r|New Thunderbolts #17}} After the clone and Gorgon captured and brainwashed [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] into joining Hydra,{{r|{{cl|Wolverine Vol 3 21}}-[[Wolverine Vol 3 22|22]]}} they sent him to kill the real Strucker, who was saved by the new [[Andreas von Strucker (Earth-616)|Swordsman]].{{r|New Thunderbolts #4}}

The clone later sent a brainwashed [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] to recruit [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]]{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 23}} and attack the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 25}} The [[Invaders (Modern) (Earth-616)|Invaders]] and their allies were closing into defeating the terrorist threat. This did not please "Baron Strucker". He wanted to avoid their secrets at the [[Mazikhandar|Mazikhadian]] base fall into the wrong hands, and therefore the [[Necromancer]], who was on the battlefield, must die. "Strucker" sent Wolverine to take out the Invaders.{{r|New Invaders #6}}

At the same time, the real Strucker wanted to reclaim Hydra's control by setting off some nuclear bombs in [[Manhattan]]; when he was opposed by the Thunderbolts, he tried to escape but he was intercepted by Baron Helmut Zemo, who wanted to ally with him to control Hydra and the world.{{r|New Thunderbolts #5|6}} Zemo crashed his escape pod and notified Hydra agents loyal to Strucker so they could retrieve him. They placed him in stasis in an old Hydra base in [[Novosibirsk]], [[Russia]]. This way Zemo made sure Strucker stayed away from the fight for control of Hydra and that he may retrieve him for his plans whenever he wished.{{r|New Thunderbolts #17}}

Meanwhile, the clone was forced to suicide by Elsbeth and Gorgon in a ritual where "Strucker" abdicated powers to them.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 25}} Wolverine and S.H.I.E.L.D. ended up stopping their plans, killing them both.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 30|31}}

===Secret Invasion===
During the [[Secret Invasion]], Baron Strucker was attacked by [[Skrulls]] who were attempting to take over Hydra. He destroyed his own base in order to wipe out the invaders.{{r|Secret Warriors #2}}

===Dark Reign===
[[File:Wolfgang von Strucker Earth-616 from Secret Warriors Vol 1 5.jpg|thumb|right]]
Fury discovered how Hydra had corrupted S.H.I.E.L.D., so Fury formed the [[Secret Warriors (Earth-616)|Secret Warriors]] to fight back. Baron Strucker formed a Hydra High Council; consisting of [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]], a new [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Earth-616)|Madame Hydra]], the [[Daniel Whitehall (Earth-616)|Kraken]], and [[Hive (Earth-616)|Hive]].{{r|Secret Warriors #3}}

Baron Strucker had Hydra attack a Hand temple and forced the shaman to resurrect the stone remains of Gorgon.{{r|Secret Warriors #4}}{{r|Secret Warriors #5}} The Council did not care, and eagerly suggested Gorgon aid them in gaining power and taking over the Hand. Gorgon agreed if he could join the council. Strucker ordered an attack on the Pacific [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] base. The Secret Warriors and Howling Commandos attacked too and, though Strucker killed several soldiers of both Fury and Osborn, Hydra lost. The Council escaped by teleporting away.{{r|Secret Warriors #6}}

Baron Strucker negotiated with [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]], who agreed to stay out of Hydra's business.{{r|Secret Warriors #7}}{{r|Secret Warriors #11}} When [[James Taylor James (Earth-616)|Hellfire]] stole a large amount of Fury's money, Strucker had the cash tracked straight back to him and captured him.{{r|Secret Warriors #13}} Strucker threatened to kill [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Quake]], and the Warrior agreed to his demands.{{r|Secret Warriors #14|15}} Strucker then led an attack on Fury's forces,{{r|Secret Warriors #16}} killing many including [[Gabriel Jones (Earth-616)|Gabe Jones]]. In retribution, Fury killed Hellfire.{{r|{{cl|Secret Warriors Vol 1 20}}-[[Secret Warriors Vol 1 22|22]]}}

After the battle, Strucker and Fury were kidnapped by the Kraken.{{r|Secret Warriors #25}} Kraken was revealed to be [[Jacob Fury (Earth-616)|Jake Fury]], who had been presumed dead. Strucker learned that it was, in fact, S.H.I.E.L.D. who had been controlling Hydra.{{r|Secret Warriors #26}} Before being able to speak his final words, Nick Fury shot him in the head killing him on the spot.{{r|Secret Warriors #27}}

===Second Resurrection===
Under unrevealed circumstances, Baron Strucker came back to life. He resurfaced some time after his death in the [[Himalayas]], where he held a clandestine black market auction for a data cell that provided the location of a bioweapon which consisted of a smart bomb that targeted specific genetics. Agent [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-616)|Phil Coulson]] of S.H.I.E.L.D. was there disguised as [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc the Leaper]] to buy the data. However, due to the importance of his mission, he could not attempt to arrest Strucker.{{r|All-New, All-Different Marvel Point One #1}} Strucker also apparently resurrected his twins, who now run the supervillain club [[Club Fenris|Fenris]].{{r|Illuminati #2}}
