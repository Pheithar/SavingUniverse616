===Origin===
Born in [[Maui]], [[Hawaii (State)|Hawaii]], Alani Ryan quickly developed a talent for surfing under the tutelage of her father [[Alaka'i Ryan Jr. (Earth-616)|Alaka'i Ryan Jr.]]. One day while surfing off the coast, Alani and her father were attacked by a shark-training, albino villain calling himself Great White. Great White sent one of his sharks after Alani's father. To protect him, she jumped into the shark. At that moment Alani's [[Homo Superior|mutant]] power to move through solid matter manifested and she caused the shark to crumble. Before Great White could launch another attack, [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] came to the rescue. Following the battle, Alani's grandmother [[Alice Terrel (Earth-616)|Alice Ryan]] was revealed to be a former acquaintance of Namor's from the 1940s and a close friend of Namor's former lover [[Betty Dean (Earth-616)|Betty Dean]]. Alani began to learn all she could about Namor and [[Atlanteans|Atlantean culture]].{{r|Namor: The First Mutant Vol 1 5}}

===Academy X===
Loa became a student at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] and adopted the codename Loa. Along with her fellow students, [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]], [[Andrea Margulies (Earth-616)|Rubber Maid]], [[Lazaro Kotikash (Earth-616)|Kidogo]], [[Sarah Vale (Earth-616)|Network]], and [[Paras Gavaskar (Earth-616)|Indra]], she was assigned to [[Alpha Squadron (Earth-616)|Alpha Squadron]], the training squad advised by former [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] member, [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]]. When Northstar was apparently killed by a brainwashed [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], advising duties for Alpha Squadron were taken over by [[Xiâ€™an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 13}}{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook Vol 1 1}}
[[File:Alani Ryan (Earth-616) from New X-Men Academy X Yearbook Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|150px|thumb|left|In uniform]]

After [[Decimation|M-Day]], when 91.4% of the world's mutant population lost their powers overnight, Alani was one of the twenty-seven students to retain her powers. She was one of the students [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] placed in a fateful all-out brawl that would determine who would become the new [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] trainees. Loa failed to make the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]] team. Before the fight, she threatened to "crumble" Anole's tongue if he touched her with it. Despite this, Loa remained close friends with Anole, as well as [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 23}}

Loa and several other students were sucked down into [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]]. There, a demon was killed trying to attack her. She moved to protect Anole as [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] decided she needed to take one of their souls to make a new [[Soulsword]]. When Magik went to confront [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]], Alani jumped to attack her, but Magik blasted her to the ground with her powers. Loa survived the final fight against [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]] and returned to the school with the rest of the students.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #37|41}}

Later, Loa began dating [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 43}}

===San Francisco===
Like most of the world's remaining mutant population, Loa moved to the Bay area when [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and the X-Men named [[San Francisco]] the new mutant safe haven. At [[Graymalkin Industries]] she tried to help [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] recover from the loss of [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]].{{r|X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3}} Loa, along with fellow students [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]] and [[Sidney Green (Earth-616)|Onyxx]], was tasked with keeping peace at the riots on Telegraph Hill after the mutant-hate group "Humanity Now!" marched from [[Sacramento]] to San Francisco to promote "[[Proposition X]]," a bill designed to regulate mutant breeding, displeasing many citizens of San Francisco, mutant and non-mutant alike.{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1}}
[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) from Nation X Vol 1 2 0001.jpg|200px|thumb|right|With her friends in San Francisco]]

Later after the X-Men moved to the island base, [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], Loa was sorting donated books for the Utopia library with Rockslide when she found a remarkable likeness of [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] in the pages of a book about the American Revolutionary War.{{r|Cable Vol 2 22}} Loa was among the students exploring the island when Mercury was attacked by a holographic recording of a younger [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]].{{r|Nation X #1}} One night, Loa led a secret mission to raid the Utopia food rations with the help of Rockslide and [[Ben Hammil (Earth-616)|Match]]. They were opposed by [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]], but were finally successful in indulging their sweet tooth.{{r|Nation X #4}}

During the attack of [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]]'s undead forces on Utopia, Alani was attacked by the reanimated [[Fabian Cortez (Earth-616)|Cortez]], [[Seamus Mellencamp (Earth-616)|Mellencamp]], and [[Marco Delgado (Earth-616)|Delgado]]. She was saved by [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], who had been in her room playing with her toys and reading her diary (which he denied) when he heard her screams. Together, they eviscerated the reanimated mutants.{{r|X-Force Annual Vol 3 1}}

Loa accompanied Indra, [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], Magneto, and Anole to [[Mumbai]], [[India]] when the Gavaskar family called Indra back home.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #238}} While there Loa took down a [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] on her own. Loa helped defeat the [[Children of the Vault (Earth-616)|Children of the Vault]] and saved Mumbai from destruction.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #239|241}}

===Assisting Namor===
During the [[Vampires|Vampire]] siege on San Francisco and Utopia, Loa assisted King Namor in defeating the [[Aqueos]]. It was during a battle with the Aqueos that she learned the Atlantean Amulet allowed her to breathe underwater.{{r|Namor: The First Mutant Vol 1 4}} King Namor and the Atlanteans seem to have adopted her as an honorary citizen of Atlantis since that time.{{r|Namor: The First Mutant Vol 1 5}}

After studying her, [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Dr. Nemesis]] concluded that the Amulet had permanently changed Alani's physiology due to the way it reacted with her [[X-Gene]]; even without it, she could breathe underwater. However, the transformation had not ceased when the Amulet was removed. Within four to five hours, she would be unable to breathe air.{{r|Namor: The First Mutant Vol 1 5}} Namor himself broke the news to Alani, who took the news badly. Inexplicably, spectres emerged from the Amulet and dragged Namor back inside to Hell. Psychic probes from Emma Frost determined that Alani had not done anything consciously or subconsciously to cause it.{{r|Namor: The First Mutant Vol 1 5|8}}

[[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], Loa, and [[Abira (Earth-616)|Abira]] traveled to Hell to attempt to bring Namor back. During their trek to find him, Doom asked what Loa had planned to say to Namor to listen to her. She said she'd talk some sense into him. This caused Doom to laugh and said if she managed this then he would kneel before her. The trio helped Namor find himself again and the four of them battled their way out of Hell and back to Atlantis.{{citation}}

===Fear Itself===
Later when the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]] transformed [[Attuma (Earth-616)|Attuma]] into Nerkkod, one of his [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]], Namor found himself facing a great foe. A new incarnation of the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] was formed, with Loa herself becoming a member. Thanks to more magical interventions, Loa was again altered so she could breathe above water again. She was forced to kill [[Aradnea (Earth-616)|Aradnea]] to save the life of [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]].{{r|Fear Itself: The Deep #1|#4}}

===Avengers Academy===
After the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] attacked the X-Men on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]],{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #2|#4}} they captured their younger members. Hoping to keep them out of the conflict, they placed them in the custody of the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]]. While there, Loa formed a close relationship with a fellow Hawaiian, [[Ken Mack (Earth-616)|Mettle]]. Although most of the younger X-Men decided to leave, Loa chose to remain at and enrol in the Avengers Academy.{{r|Avengers Academy #29|#31}}

===Krakoa===
Loa was killed as part of the explosion of anti-mutant violence in the wake of X-Man's [[X-Men Disassembled|attacks]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 11}} She was later resurrected by the hand of [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]],{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 7}} a group of mutants capable of combining their powers into a process of resurrection, brought together by Xavier as part of his plans for mutant ascension and became a citizen of the island nation [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}

*'''''Underwater Breathing:''''' Alani can breathe underwater indefinitely but only when wearing the Amulet.{{r|Namor: The First Mutant Vol 1 4|#6}}

* For several years it remained unclear whether Alani's "tattoos" were a manifestation of her mutant powers, or man-made. Eventually, her origin story confirmed that the "tattoo" markings on her skin are in fact an aspect of her mutation and appeared at the time her powers first manifested.{{r|Namor: The First Mutant Vol 1 5}}
