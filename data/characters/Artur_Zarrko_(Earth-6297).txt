| History                 = 
===23rd Century===
Dr. Artur Zarrko was a brilliant evil scientist from the year [[Earth-6297|2262]], who built a time machine to escape from his peaceful 23rd century and visit more primitive periods, where nuclear weapons could be stolen easily.{{r|Journey into Mystery #86}}

===In the Past===
While [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] is helping the US Military test their new missiles, Zarrko appeared in his time machine and stole the device and escaped into the future before Thor can stop him. Promising to recover the bomb, Thor summons his father Odin and asks how he might travel into the future. Odin guides him in using his hammer to time travel by tying a fragment of [[Time Cube|Zarrko's craft]] (broken off in the brief battle between Thor and Zarrko) and spin his hammer faster than the speed of light so that its magic will transport him to the future.{{r|Journey into Mystery #86}}

===Back in the 23rd Century===
The spell worked and Thor is sent into the future year of 2262, where he found that Zarrko has used the C-Bomb to take over the future Earth. When Zarrko learns of Thor's arrival in his time, he sends his newly established guards after Thor. Thor quickly finds someone from the future to act as a decoy, putting on a costume like Thor, while Thor dawns a black robe and the two storm Zarrko's citadel. Inside, the fake Thor is captured lulling Zarrko into a false sense of security when he is suddenly ambushed by the real Thor. When Zarrko's weapons fail he flees and sics an army of robots against Thor, who grab his hammer. Using a water pipe to short circuit the robots, Thor manages to make them drop his hammer before the sixty second time limit would have him change back into Donald Blake. Zarrko meanwhile has escaped in a ship and is planning to drop the C-Bomb on the city, however Thor summons up a storm which causes Zarrko's ship to fly erratically enough for Thor to recover the dropped bomb. When Zarrko's ship crashes, the villain survives but has suffered amnesia and is taken into custody. Praised as a hero, Thor then returns to the present where he returns the C-Bomb back to the military.{{r|Journey into Mystery #86}}

===Return to the Past===
Odin halved Thor's powers and barred him from entering Asgard when he insisted on marrying [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Jane Foster]]. Seeking to take advantage of this opportunity, [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] restored Zarrko's memory, who promptly traveled back in time to battle Thor. This time Thor was unable to defeat [[Mining Robot (Earth-6297)|Zarrko's robot]] and willingly surrendered and agreed to return with him to the 23rd Century as his slave.{{r|Journey into Mystery #101}} Thor assisted Zarrko in conquering the 23rd Century, taking over the central computer that ran the entire world. Freed from his vow to help Zarrko, Thor then quickly dispatched his foe, incapacitating him with ease without his robot around. Thor then returned to his own time, and Odin - having viewed all the events as they transpired - restored Thor to his full strength.{{r|Journey into Mystery #102}}

Zarrko's plot was revealed to be a plan to save humanity. In his future, Thor, had separated from his human self, [[Jake Olson (Earth-616)|Jake Olson]], and lost his ability to understand humanity. Because of this, [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] became more and more oppressive and imposing, and believed that ruling humanity was the only just thing to do. Zarrko knew that in his future, Thor would become a tyrant, so he had to travel back in time and stop him before the Odin Force made him invincible and near-omnipotent.{{r|Thor Vol 2 #43}}

[[File:Artur Zarrko (Earth-6297) from Thor Vol 1 441 0001.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Artur Zarrko, The Tomorrow Man]]
When the Governments of Earth launched a massive assault on Asgard, Zarrko tried to escape with his time machine, only to be stopped by [[Thialfi (Earth-616)|Thialfi]].{{r|Thor Vol 2 #66|67}}

Zarrko's attempted time travel was instrumental for Thor to create for himself a new future in which he would never be the tyrant he would have been without his human self.{{r|Thor Vol 2 #79}}

===Boris===
Zarrko later returned disguised as Boris, a manservant to [[Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)|Kristoff Vernard]], the heir of [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], who had become a member of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] following the "death" of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]].{{r|Fantastic Four #397}}{{r|Fantastic Four #399}}{{r|Fantastic Four #406}} He was soon exposed but used his time machine to cause chaos in the building by bringing in various heroes and villains from the past and the future to fight it out. He later escaped, deciding that all he wanted was a quiet place and plenty of food.{{r|Fantastic Four #407|409}}
