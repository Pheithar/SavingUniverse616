'''Angelo Espinosa''' was born in the ''barrio'' in South Central [[Los Angeles]]. His girlfriend, [[Miguela Tores (Earth-616)|Tores]], became a gang member, straining their relationship because Angelo refused to fly colors, mostly for his mother's sake. One night, Tores and some of her friends picked Angelo up to cruise, but it turned into a drive-by shooting. The stress of the incident caused Angelo's powers to manifest, and he passed out. He woke up with the car on fire, Tores' friend Gordo dead, and Tores gone. A homeless man was trying to steal Angelo's wallet while he was sleeping, and, as Angelo fled the burning car, it exploded, killing the man. With his wallet found on the unidentifiable corpse of the homeless man, Angelo Espinosa was declared legally dead. None of his friends or family were aware of this and many truly believed him to be dead. Angelo left town to keep his mutation secret, and because he believed he was protecting Tores from a murder rap.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 ½}}

Angelo was one of the young mutants targeted by the [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]]. He joined [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]] when it opened and soon showed himself to be fun-loving, despite his resentment for his powers. Initially, he was quite secretive and wasn't keen on having authority figures tell him what to do. As he became more comfortable with his powers and teammates, his attitude changed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 317|318}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 1|3}}
[[File:Generation X Vol 1 46 Textless.jpg|180px|thumb|left|With the rest of Gen X]]
During his time with Generation X, Angelo was targeted by the [[Carl Denti (Earth-616)|X-Cutioner]]. The X-Cutioner assumed he had murdered the 'real' Angelo Espinosa and was using his name.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 17}} After escaping, Angelo went home with [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]] accompanying him. They visited Angelo's 'grave' and encountered Tores,{{r|Generation X Vol 1 21}} his ex-girlfriend.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 29|31}} They also observed Angelo's mother, though she did not see them. Angelo was heartbroken as his mother spat at Tores for being a [[Homo superior|mutant]]; it was clear that she had no respect for mutants.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 ½}}

As a member of Generation X, Angelo performed fairly well, and increased his skill with his powers to the point where he could even rearrange his face.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 50}} He used his skin both offensively and defensively, although he was sometimes reckless.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 73}} Throughout his tenure, he seemed to have feelings for [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]], but he never capitalized on any opportunities with her.  When the school closed, Skin went with Jubilee to L.A., where they shared an apartment while she tried to become an actress. Angelo soon realized that the agents and directors were exploiting Jubilee, and he cautioned her against accepting more roles. Eventually, he was proven correct, and they apparently split up, as Jubilee ended up in the [[X-Corps (Earth-616)|X-Corps]].{{r|Generation X Vol 1 75}}{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 34}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 403}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 427}}

[[File:Angelo Espinosa (Earth-616) from X-Men Unlimited Vol 2 9 001.png|300px|right]]
What happened to Skin afterwards is a mystery, but someone must have deduced his connection to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]], and he was found crucified on the Mansion's grounds, along with other mutants. Unfortunately, though [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]]'s new healing factor managed to save some of the mutants' lives, Skin did not respond to the treatment and was pronounced dead.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 423}} Even worse, when the cemetery where his family buried him found out that Angelo was a mutant, they attempted to have him exhumed and cremated on the grounds that mutancy conflicted with the cemetery organization's religious beliefs. Jubilee and [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]] happened to be there and tried to stop the move, in the process revealing one of the cemetery workers as a mutant and costing him his job. Husk and Jubilee were able to acquire his ashes.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 427}}

Skin was resurrected by means of the [[Techno-organic virus#The Transmode Virus|Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]]'s army of deceased mutants. Under the control of Selene and [[Eliphas (Earth-616)|Eli Bard]], he took part in the assault on the mutant nation of [[Utopia]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 22}} After Selene's defeat, he was presumably returned to the after-life alongside other deceased mutants.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 25}}

===Krakoa===
Years later, Skin resurfaced in the newly-founded mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]],{{r|X-Men Vol 5 5}} having been reborn by the hand of [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]], a group of mutants capable of combining their powers into a process of resurrection, brought together by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] as part of his plans for mutant ascension.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}

His resurrection was pushed forward on the schedule because his former teammate [[Everett Thomas (Earth-616)|Everett Thomas]] (Synch) was needed to act as a back-up for The Five and they believed the two young mutants would help each over re-adjust.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 5}} He was seen arm in arm with Synch and standing next to [[Broo (Earth-616)|Broo]] at a party following the first meeting of the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}} Skin later joined the newly reformed X-Men in [[Otherworld]] defending Krakoa from the hoards of [[Amenth]].{{r|X of Swords: Destruction Vol 1 1}}

'''Extra Skin Elasticity:''' Possesses about six feet of extra skin on his body. He was capable of stretching, deforming, wrapping, expanding, and compressing this extra amount of epidermis. When relaxed, Skin’s extra skin would give him the appearance of a melted candle, but, with concentration, he was capable of contracting it to resemble his previous appearance or change it a little{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 10}} and even grow spikes.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 75}}

*'''''High Resistance:''''' Skin’s extra skin also grants him some degree of resistance to physical injury, especially punctures and tearing.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 10}}

'''Shapeshifting:''' Skin could use his extra skin to change the shape of his face and body.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 50}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 10}}
