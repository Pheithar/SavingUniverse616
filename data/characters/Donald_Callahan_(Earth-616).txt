===Squid===
Their first outing as the Squid and Ms. Fortune was not very successful as members of the [[Wicked Brigade (Earth-616)|Wicked Brigade]] when they targeted Spider Man because a bounty was placed on his head.

Sometime later, Peter Parker found Big Mike at his bar while he was speaking to his son, Donny. Big Mike stopped his conversation with his son when Peter Parker arrived. Donny left the bar when his father refused to continue their conversation. Donny reappeared as the Squid and attacked another store owner near his father's bar. Spider Man tried to intervene but Big Mike told Spidey that the Squid was his son. The Squid expressed to his father that he paid no attention to him as he grew up and all he wanted was his love and attention. He told his father that he turned into the Squid so no one can push him around anymore. The Squid started to turn on his father until Spider Man was able to defuse the situation and calm Donny down.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 26}}

| Powers                  = '''Squid-like Physiology:''' The Squid can shift from his human form to a green-skinned, (sometimes) mouthless squid-like form. Squid has several powers that are similar to a cephalopod.
* '''Tentacles:''' In his Squid form, Callahan sprouted several extendable tentacles that protrude from his upper back, with which he could lift things that are heavier than his human form and uses them to grasp and attack his enemies. They can restrain a person with Class 10 strength.
* '''Ink Generation:''' The Squid can shoot ink at his enemies. The ink can blind his opponents and the smell can be nauseating for some. Originally it was only from his hands, later on it could secrete from anywhere on his body.
* '''Enhanced Strength:''' He has a degree of superhuman strength.
* '''Minor Elasticity:''' He has either no bones or a highly malleable skeleton, enabling him to squeeze through narrow spaces, such as pipes.
