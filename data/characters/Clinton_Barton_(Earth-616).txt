| Overview = '''Clinton "Clint" Barton'''{{r|Hawkeye: Freefall Vol 1 4}} aka '''Hawkeye'''{{r|Tales of Suspense #57}} is an American skilled marksman, archer, and former circus performer and minor supervillain turned member of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]; "Earth's Mightiest Heroes.{{r|Avengers #16}} As a member of the Avengers he always had friction with the team but always returned to fight any threat. Barton was raised in the circus, trained by criminals and grew from a troubled youth into one of the Earth's greatest heroes. Known for his use of a bow and arrow as his primary weapon, his skill is so great that it appears like he never misses.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man Vol 1 4}} He has worked with [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], whom he developed a strong friendship with.{{r|Tales of Suspense #60}} For many years, he was married to fellow superhero [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]],{{r|Hawkeye Vol 1 1}} and together they were the original founders of the [[West Coast Avengers]].{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 1 1}}

| History                 =
===Early life===
[[File:Harold Barton (Earth-616), Clinton Barton (Earth-616), Edith Barton (Earth-616), and Charles Barton (Earth-616) from Hawkeye Blind Spot Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Clint's early life]]
Clinton "Clint" Barton was the son of [[Harold Barton (Earth-616)|Harold Barton]] and [[Edith Barton (Earth-616)|Edith Barton]].{{r|Hawkeye: Blind Spot Vol 1 1}} He grew up working in his father's Butchers shop in [[Waverly]], [[Iowa (State)|Iowa]] with his older brother, [[Charles Barton (Earth-616)|Barney]].{{r|Hawkeye: Blind Spot #1}} Their father was abusive, especially when he drank and continually beat his young boys like Clint;{{r|Hawkeye: Blind Spot #1}} Barney taught Clint how to fight and helped him to improve his aim.{{r|Hawkeye Vol 4 12}} Harold's drinking eventually cost him his life along with his wife when both died in a car accident. Clint and Barney were sent to numerous foster homes; while running away from one of them, they encountered and joined a [[Carson Carnival (Earth-616)|traveling circus]] where the pair worked as roustabouts.{{r|All-New Hawkeye #1}} While a member of the circus, Clint was trained by the original [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]] and by [[Buck Chisholm (Earth-616)|Trick Shot]]. Clint later found the Swordsman embezzling money from the carnival. Before he could turn his mentor over to the authorities, Clint was beaten and left for dead, allowing the Swordsman to escape town.{{r|Avengers #19}} Clint's relationship with his brother Barney and Trick Shot soon deteriorated as well.{{r|Hawkeye: Blind Spot Vol 1 1}}

===Becoming Hawkeye===
[[File:Hawkeye Vol 3 8 Textless.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Clint as [[Hawkeye]] with the [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]]]]
Clint adapted his archery skills to become a star carnival attraction, a master archer called "Hawkeye", otherwise known as “The World's Greatest Marksman”. He spent some time as a member of Tiboldt's Circus.{{r|Hawkeye Vol 3 #7|8}} After some time in the performance business, Barton witnessed [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] in action, and decided to try and emulate the hero by donning a colorful costume and employing his archery skills to fight crime. However, during his first public appearance, Hawkeye was mistaken for a thief by police. The [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], at the time a Soviet agent, met Barton by chance and enlisted him as her partner. Together they clashed against heroes such as Spider-Man and Iron Man on several occasions.{{r|Untold Tales of Spider-Man Vol 1 17}}{{r|Tales of Suspense #57}}{{r|Tales of Suspense #60}}

===The Avengers===
Although Hawkeye became romantically involved with the Black Widow, he was unhappy being a criminal. When he approached the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and told them of his desire to reform, Iron Man sponsored his membership on the team. Barton formed, along with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] and her brother, [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], an incarnation of the Avengers known as "Cap's Kooky Quartet." This was the lineup that succeeded the original after the four remaining founders took indefinite leaves of absence.{{r|Avengers #16}} At first regarded as less formidable than the previous roster, the new team soon proved themselves against the likes of [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]]{{r|Avengers #23|24}} and [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]].{{r|Avengers #25}} 

Hawkeye remained an active member of the Avengers for years, his archery skills, and inventive trick arrows augmenting the superhuman powers of his associates. His carefree and rebellious personality meant that he sometimes argued with Captain America, believing he could make a better leader. Eventually, however, Hawkeye came to respect Cap more than any other Avenger and became one of his staunchest supporters.{{r|Avengers #29|30}}

===Continued Career and Mockingbird===
For a short time, Barton abandoned his Hawkeye identity and while taking [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]]'s growth serum, operated under the name [[Goliath]].{{r|Avengers #63}} After resuming his Hawkeye role, he also briefly became the ''[[Golden Archer]]''.{{r|Captain America #179}}

[[File:Clinton Barton (Earth-616) from Captain America Reborn Vol 1 3 001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Clint as [[Goliath]]]]
Around this time, Hawkeye began a series of extended leaves of absence from the Avengers, often trying to establish an independent identity outside of the group. The first instance actually saw Clint resign on the grounds of wanting to prove he did not need a team to be effective - only to almost immediately join the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]]{{r|Defenders #7}} for several adventures (including opposing the Avengers{{r|Avengers/Defenders War}})! He also ended up in the 1870s where he befriended Western hero [[Matthew Hawk (Earth-616)|Two-Gun Kid]] and with the help of the Avengers, defeated Kang.{{r|Avengers #142|143}} He brought the Western hero along to the present and left the Avengers to team up with him.{{r|Avengers #147}}

During the course of another department from the team, Barton became a security chief for [[Cross Technological Enterprises (Earth-616)|Cross Technological Enterprises]]. While at Cross, he met [[Jorge Latham (Earth-616)|Jorge Latham]], an engineer who would design the [[Sky-Cycle]] as Barton's personal conveyance when he was incapacitated with a broken leg. Shortly thereafter, Clint also met and eloped with Bobbi Morse, a.k.a. fellow crime fighter [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]], when the two were kidnapped by [[William Cross (Earth-616)|Crossfire]], a villain who wanted to use hypnotic ultrasounds to force superheroes to kill each other. Hawkeye and Mockingbird defeated Crossfire, but Barton suffered permanent hearing damage due to the ultrasounds{{r|Hawkeye #4}} and for a long time was forced to wear a hearing aid. Eventually, [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]] would cure him of this injury when Clint was among heroes restored from an alternate reality.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 2 2001}}

===West Coast Avengers===
[[File:Th AvengersWestCoast4thLine-up.jpg|thumb|right|With the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]]]]
Upon his return to the Avengers with his new bride, Barton was appointed to chair a new [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|second team of Avengers]] based on the West Coast by then-chairman, the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]]. The team Hawkeye chose consisted of Mockingbird, his original inspiration Iron Man, [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]], and [[Greer Grant (Earth-616)|Tigra]]. Hawkeye and Mockingbird acted as the guiding force behind the team. Barton hired his old friend from Cross Technologies, Jorge Latham, to act as the on-staff mechanic and to build a new fleet of sky-cycles. Hank Pym helped the team in a civilian capacity as the resident scientist.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #1}}

One of the western team's adventures scattered them across time. While Hawkeye and most of the others were stranded in ancient [[Egypt]], Mockingbird was in the Old West, held captive, and rendered amnesiac by [[Lincoln Slade (Earth-616)|Phantom Rider (Lincoln Slade)]], posing as her lover. In a mountaintop battle between the two after her escape, Barbara allowed Slade to fall to his death. The couple separated after Clint learned of all this through the vengeful Rider's spirit.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #35}}

Morse, along with Tigra and [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]], left the team and briefly formed a splinter group. After that group failed,{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #41}} Mockingbird proved instrumental in consulting on a multinational plot to abduct and dismantle the Vision for his near "benevolent" takeover of the world (although he aborted the plan before anyone was truly harmed). When Bobbi realized the plot wasn't just a "worst-case scenario" and was actually being put into action, she returned to warn the Whackos.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #43}} The government intrusion into the Avengers continued when they were forced to accept a new leader, USAgent, in order to keep their security clearance. Clint quit the team after being tossed aside like this, and he and Mockingbird ended up in Wisconsin training the unofficial franchise team, the Great Lakes Avengers.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #45|46}}

Hawkeye later returned to the West Coast branch after they reorganized under United Nations jurisdiction, although Bobbi remained with the Great Lakes team.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #69}} The West Coast team operated both independently and in conjunction with the senior East Coast team. On one mission, both teams were caught in a [[Operation Galactic Storm|war]] in between the Kree and [[Shi'ar Empire]]. Barton was initially relegated to remain on Earth as part of the "rear guard" team due to a "lack of raw power." With some timely aid from Hank Pym, he re-assumed his old Goliath identity and took [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|USAgent]]'s place on Captain America's team bound for the [[Kree Empire]]. After Iron Man, against orders, led a group of Avengers to execute the [[Kree]] [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]], Barton was important in helping Captain America regain confidence in his leadership.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #80|82}}{{r|Captain America #401}} Briefly maintaining the Goliath identity, Clint and Bobbi seemingly managed to reconcile.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #92}}

(It would later be revealed, though, that the "[[H'rpra (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]]" he was rebuilding a relationship with was in actuality a deep-cover [[Skrulls|Skrull]] sleeper agent.{{r|New Avengers: The Reunion #2}})

On one of the AWC's last mission, the team began an otherworldly trek to rescue the captured "Mockingbird" from the hands of [[Satannish (Earth-616)|Satannish the Supreme]] and [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]]. During their escape, Mephisto killed "Mockingbird".{{r|Avengers: West Coast #100}} Shortly thereafter, Vision began the vote that disbanded the West Coast team. Hawkeye was on leave from the team mourning for Mockingbird, and wasn't involved in the decision.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #102}}

===Renewed Solo Career and Thunderbolts===
After Mockingbird's apparent death, Hawkeye became a solo agent for a period of time. During which, Barton was commissioned to train a group of rebels known as the [[Shadows (Earth-616)|Shadows]] along with [[Pascal Guacana (Earth-616)|Sundance]] and [[Tomás Aguado (Earth-616)|Striker]]. He attempted to keep them from killing, but on one raid Striker killed a woman and injured her fiancé, a friend of [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|James Rhodes]]. As War Machine, Rhodes investigated and was surprised to see Hawkeye among the rebels. A government-backed group led by US Agent also arrived adding further confusion between the "Brothers in Arms". The three were able to stop the conflict and were confronted by the mysterious [[Advisor (Earth-616)|Advisor]].{{r|Force Works #12}}

Hawkeye later returned to the Avengers and was part of the team when they fought [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]] and was sent alongside them to [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Counter-Earth]] by [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]] to save his life while the rest of his world believed him to have died.{{r|Avengers #397}}{{r|Onslaught Marvel Universe #1}}{{r|Avengers Vol 2 1}}

[[File:Hawkeye Vol 3 5 Textless.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Hawkeye as a hero and an [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avenger]]]]
When the Avengers returned to their own world he continued serving as a member though he had frequent disagreements with the team.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 #1|9}} After years of fighting alongside the Avengers, Hawkeye offered to lead the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]].{{r|Thunderbolts #21}} Sympathetic to their plight as criminals trying to redeem themselves for their past actions, he decided to help them become a legitimate superhero team. Hawkeye initially posed as the criminal [[Dreadknight]] to meet the team before formally introducing himself and his intentions. He also became romantically involved with [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Moonstone]]. As a leader, Hawkeye led the Thunderbolts both alongside and sometimes against his former teammates in the Avengers.{{r|Thunderbolts #20|75}}

===Death and Rebirth===
Eventually re-joining the Avengers, Clint began a dallying affair with the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]], causing tension with her sometime lover, Hank Pym. When the Scarlet Witch had her breakdown that resulted in the breakup of the Avengers, Barton perished on an exploding Kree ship created by her crazed state.{{r|Avengers #502}}

The [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] did not act again until sometime later when she altered time and space on a universal level: changing Earth's history to that of the [[Earth-58163|House of M]], where mutants had become the rulers and human beings the oppressed minority. Barton was very much alive in this remade world and affiliated with an underground [[Avengers (Earth-58163)|human resistance]] opposing the general mutant supremacy. Like all of the other inhabitants on the planet, though, Clint retained no memory of [[Earth-616|his previous life]].{{r|House of M #4}}

This changed, however, after X-Man [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] restored his memories, hoping to recruit him to a direct opposition of reawakened heroes against [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and the Scarlet Witch. While this rebellious network incorporated more of his original Avenger teammates, Barton was at the time reluctant, preoccupied with the disquieting notion of his recent demise among his returned memories.

Eventually confronting and failing to kill Wanda Maximoff with one of his arrows, he brought up their shared history as teammates as well as his former romantic feelings for her, angrily demanding to know why she ended his life. This encounter did not last long as Clint's heightened emotional state renewed Wanda's own mental instability, causing her to once again erase him from existence.{{r|{{cl|House of M #7}}-[[House of M #8|8]]}}

Wanda then restored reality to its original state, only to [[Decimation|remove the mutant genome from millions on Earth]], remaking them as powerless mainline humans. Clint awoke inside the ruins of [[Avengers Mansion]] confused by the events. Leaving his "Hawkeye" wardrobe and equipment there, he set out to locate the Scarlet Witch, seeking [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] for assistance. Strange was the only person in the world to know of his revival at this time. Clint found her living like a gypsy in a small European mountain village. Spending the night with her, Barton learned she had no memory of her previous life and was evidently depowered. He left at dawn the next morning, heeding the warning of Doctor Strange not to attempt to revive her memories and possibly worsen her mental condition.{{r|New Avengers #26}}

===Ronin===
After the apparent assassination of Captain America, Iron Man approached Clint about taking up the [[Captain America's Shield|shield]].{{r|Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America #3}} Barton proved himself to be one of the few who could wield it effectively and considered taking up the mantle. He and Iron Man encountered the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] called [[Elijah Bradley (Earth-616)|Patriot]] and [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]]. They convinced him that wearing Steve Rogers' costume and wielding his shield would be wrong, and he allowed the unregistered young heroes to go free.{{r|Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America #3}} Later, when Clint learned that Stark had given the shield to [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|"Bucky" Barnes]] (Cap's WWII sidekick and the reformed Winter Soldier), he paid this new Captain America a visit to express his disapproval.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 37}}

[[File:Dark Reign The List - Avengers Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Clint Barton as [[Ronin]], the masterless Samurai]]
Barton revealed himself as the current user of the [[Ronin]] guise, joining the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]]. During [[World War Hulk]], he was defeated by two of the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]'s [[Warbound (Earth-616)|Warbound]] while trying to defend [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]].{{r|New Avengers #27|31}}

During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], Barton headed to the [[Savage Land]] with the New Avengers to investigate a crashed Skrull ship. There, both they and the [[Mighty Avengers (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]] came across many heroes from years past including a "[[Clinton Barton (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]]" and a "[[Barbara Morse (Retro, Skrull) (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]]". This "Hawkeye" was discovered to be a Skrull, but after Clint questioned "Mockingbird" of her miscarriage, he truly believed her to be his late wife. Teammates [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] were more suspicious. This was justified later, when Clint was proven wrong by [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]], whose technology forced the Skrulls to revert to their true forms. Clint did not hesitate in shooting the Skrull Mockingbird impostor dead with one of Black Widow's firearms. Enraged by such deception, Barton became more dedicated to opposing the invading Skrulls without any second thoughts about killing them. During the final battle with the Skrulls alongside dozens of superheroes, he used his old bow and quiver of trick arrows (dropped by the wounded Kate Bishop) to kill several Super-Skrulls and to severely wound Queen [[Veranke (Earth-616)|Veranke]], who orchestrated the entire invasion while posing as Spider-Woman. After the fighting, it was discovered that the people replaced by the Skrulls were alive and well, including Bobbi.{{r|Secret Invasion #8}} 

===Dark Reign===
Reuniting with his wife, they were the first to be invited by Barnes to his [[Brooklyn]] safe house, offering it as a new base of operations for the fugitive New Avengers. The team's first order of business became a search and rescue mission for the [[Danielle Cage (Earth-616)|infant daughter]] of fellow teammate Luke Cage, abducted during the final Skrull conflict.{{r|New Avengers #48|50}} 

Clint was infuriated at [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s rise to power- especially at the allegedly "former" villain's own Avengers group, secretly composed of super villains publicly masquerading in familiar heroic identities. Wanting to dissuade Osborn and his group from further sullying the Avengers' name and legacy, Clint and his New Avengers attempted to lure them into battle at the [[Hellfire Club Building (New York)|Hellfire Club]]'s former headquarters. Instead, they were opposed by the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]]'s [[Hood's Gang (Earth-616)|crime syndicate]], sent in place of the new "[[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]]."{{r|New Avengers #50}} 

Deducing Osborn's corrupt politics, Clint went to the media exposing his identity, denouncing the Dark Avengers, and revealing Osborn's ties to the Hood. His final words were a message encouraging the American public to resist Osborn's regime. This did not sit well with Clint's teammates as none of them were comfortable with him starting a public flame war without their consent, growing concerned for their general safety. Despite this negative feedback, Clint remained on good terms with his friends.{{r|New Avengers #50}}

Aside from the New Avengers' missions, Clint's relationships with his individual teammates continued to develop. He gradually became good friends with Luke Cage, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], and Wolverine. He was also particularly happy to be working with "classic" Avengers teammate and friend, [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers)]] - especially coming off prior tensions with her former pro-registration Mighty Avengers team. He also came to trust James Barnes, gradually accepting him as the new Captain America as well as his valued friend and ally.{{Citation}} 

Clint also learned that Bobbi did not consider him her husband any longer, having had intentions to divorce him just prior to her abduction years before, although they somewhat successfully revived their relationship. It is also noteworthy, however, that he remained distrustful and cautious of [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)]] during this time due to Skrull Queen Veranke's impersonation of her, reservations he apparently shared with teammate Luke Cage.{{Citation}}

He was later unanimously voted as leader of the New Avengers, appointing Ms. Marvel as his deputy leader. He coordinated the team in aiding Doctor Strange in locating the next Sorcerer Supreme in [[New Orleans]], opposing [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]], the Hood and [[Giuletta Nefaria (Earth-616)|Madame Masque]] in the process. Other adventures saw the New Avengers battle a rampaging [[Ymir (Earth-616)|Ymir]] alongside the Osborn's Avengers,{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2009 Avengers}} aiding the Hank Pym-led Mighty Avengers and Chinese nationalist heroes, [[People's Defense Force (China) (Earth-616)|People's Defense Force]], against the powerful deposed [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] monarch, the [[Unspoken (Earth-616)|Unspoken]] and escaping capture from the combined efforts of the Dark Avengers and the Hood's Crime Syndicate, then commandeered by Doctor [[Jonas Harrow (Earth-616)|Jonas Harrow]].{{Citation}}

The effects of the New Avengers' latter activities, however, placed Luke Cage in critical condition. Concurrently, Wolverine had also been temporarily exiled to the newly-created X-island, [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], residing out in [[San Francisco]] Bay and declared a mutant prison by Norman Osborn. Wanting to end Osborn's reign before the status of the superhero community worsened, Clint infiltrated [[Stark Tower]]. While incapacitating a majority of the Dark Avengers in a failed assassination attempt on Norman Osborn, he ultimately became imprisoned as a bargaining tool against his own team.{{r|Dark Reign: The List - Avengers #1}} Osborn, using [[Marvin Flumm (Earth-616)|Mentallo (Marvin Flumm)]], took the location of the New Avengers secret base from his mind. Fortunately, his friends were able to clear out, using the timing of the Dark Avengers' attack on their now-empty hideout to free Barton from captivity. Once they were safe in their auxiliary safe house, Clint apologized for his rogue behavior. Steve Rogers then turned up, saying that they, as the Avengers, would right Osborn's wrongs, finally defeating the villains at the [[Siege (Event)]] of [[Asgard]].{{r|Siege (Event)}}

===Heroic Age===
Steve Rogers put together a new team of Avengers. Clint joined the team and returned to his Hawkeye identity (although he encouraged Kate Bishop to keep the Hawkeye identity as well). He and Mockingbird were also members of the New Avengers, although Hawkeye later left the New Avengers when he received an Avengers priority call from the main team, claiming that he was only there to spend time with his wife.{{r|{{cl|New Avengers Vol 2 #1}}-[[New Avengers Vol 2 #3|3]]}}

[[File:Hawkeye & Mockingbird Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|With [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]]]]
Hawkeye aided Mockingbird and her anti-terrorist organization, the [[World Counterterrorism Agency (Earth-616)|World Counter-terrorism Agency]]. Together, they thwarted Crossfire's illegal arms operation and encountered Lincoln Slade's descendant, Jaime Slade, who later went on to become the new [[Jaime Slade (Earth-616)|Phantom Rider]]. Crossfire and the new Phantom Rider teamed up to battle the heroes.{{r|Hawkeye & Mockingbird #1}} This feud had its casualties with Mockingbird's [[Susan Morse (Earth-616)|mother]] being severely wounded and the death of [[Hamilton Slade (Rider) (Earth-616)|Hamilton Slade]], both at the hands of Crossfire. Hawkeye left the W.C.A. after it became clear that his relationship with Mockingbird had become too strained. However, he quickly rejoined after being informed by Steve Rogers that a kill list of international spies included Mockingbird.{{r|Hawkeye & Mockingbird #1|6}}

===Blindspot===
Hawkeye and Mockingbird teamed up with the Black Widow to take on the mysterious new [[Alexi Shostakov (Earth-616)|Ronin]] and the [[Dark Ocean Society (Earth-616)|Dark Ocean Society]]. The new Ronin was later revealed to be Alexi Shostakov, the former Red Guardian and ex-husband of the Black Widow. During the final battle with the new Ronin, Hawkeye received a strong blow to the head, which proved to be more serious than first thought.{{r|{{cl|Widowmaker Vol 1 1}}-[[Widowmaker Vol 1 4|4]]}}

While battling the [[Lethal Legion (Grim Reaper) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]] with the Avengers, Hawkeye's aim was faltering. After the battle, Tony Stark, [[Donald Blake (Earth-616)|Dr Donald Blake]] and Steve Rogers examined Hawkeye to discover what was causing it. Their diagnosis is that Hawkeye was steadily losing his sight and would soon go blind. Iron Man provided Hawkeye with technology that should stall the blindness. Later, Trick Shot arrived at Avengers Tower on the brink of death. Trick Shot told Hawkeye that he was forced to train another archer, one who was as good as Hawkeye, before fainting in his arms. Hawkeye was later ambushed by his brother Barney Barton (who was the one trained by Trick Shot) who proclaimed himself the new Trickshot. Barney manages to subdue Hawkeye and bring him to [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]]. Zemo had the brothers duel to the death. Hawkeye, despite going blind, managed to best Trickshot in battle. Before teleporting away, Baron Zemo transferred Trickshot's criminal funds over to the "victor", Hawkeye, then taunted the hero for turning his brother against him. In custody, Trickshot agreed to a bone marrow transplant to save his brother's sight, but only so he could battle Hawkeye again in the future.{{r|{{cl|Hawkeye: Blind Spot Vol 1 1}}-[[Hawkeye: Blind Spot Vol 1 4|4]]}}

===Fear Itself and Secret Avengers===
During the Asgardian [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]] and his [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]]'s attack on Earth,{{r|Fear Itself}} Hawkeye developed feelings for fellow Avenger, Spider-Woman, after they battled Nul in [[Brazil]]. Since that time, they have displayed a very curious chemistry, much to the consternation of Mockingbird. Some of their "date/missions" have seen the couple in the midst of [[Spider-Island (Event)|Spider-Island]] and a renewed campaign of Norman Osborn rallying the combined forces of [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]], [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]], and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] against the heroes.{{r|Shattered Heroes}}

[[File:Secret Avengers Vol 1 22 Textless.jpg|left|thumb|Hawkeye leading the [[Secret Avengers (Black Ops Unit) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]]]]
Captain America left the leadership of the [[Secret Avengers (Black Ops Unit) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] in the hands of Clint. He, in turn, recruited Giant-Man, [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]], [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|a new heroic Venom]], and [[Human Torch (Android) (Earth-616)|the original Human Torch]] to supplement the team's roster. He then led the Secret Avengers against the [[Father (Earth-616)|Father]], a mad scientist seeking an android takeover of Earth.{{r|Secret Avengers #21.1|25}}{{r|Secret Avengers #29|37}}

===Renaissance===
During the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|controversial struggle against the X-Men]] over the impending Earthbound arrival of the cataclysmic [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]], Hawkeye was active in the Avengers' efforts of retrieving [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], whom they believed was the key to averting the crisis.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #1}}

The preservation of the planet necessitating a means of destroying the Phoenix Force, the Avengers instead accidentally refracted the entity, bonding it to [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|five X-Men]] in a showdown on the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]].{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #5}} When the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] started to hunt down the Avengers, Clint was severely burned in a sacrificial play, saving Scarlet Witch from the Phoenix-powered Emma Frost.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #6}} Forced to be abandoned by his teammates, Hawkeye was brought to Utopia, healed and put into custody along other captured Avengers.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #7}} He rejoined the team after [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] and [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] helped retrieve every one of their captured members.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #9}}

[[File:Clinton Barton (Earth-616) from Hawkeye Vol 4 1.jpg|thumb|right]]
When this crisis was over, Clint found a new purpose in his life, beginning to take more serious stock in his personal life outside of his various Avenger-related duties. First, he bought an [[Clint Barton's Apartment Building|apartment building]] in the [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] where he had recently begun living, out from under the unsavory thugs who were going to evict all of his neighbors by tripling their rent. In the process, Hawkeye also adopted an injured dog named Arrow, which he later gave the name [[Lucky (Earth-616)|Lucky]].{{r|Hawkeye Vol 4 1}} Barton also began closer mentoring of Kate Bishop as his partner/protégée.{{r|Hawkeye Vol 4 2}} It was during this time that Clint and Spider-Woman broke up after Clint had a one-night stand with [[Darlene Wright (Earth-616)|a woman he met]],{{r|Hawkeye Vol 4 9}} whom he would later realize was involved with the same Slavic thugs who owned the building. With the help of his neighbors, Barton would eventually drive out the thugs. Unbeknownst to him, they answered to [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|the Kingpin]], who went on to put a hit out on Barton's head.{{r|Hawkeye Vol 4 22}}

===Civil War II===
Sometime following his adventures with Kate, Clint was approached by [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]], the hero also known as the Hulk. While he had been cured of his condition and hadn't turned into the Hulk in almost a year, he gave Clint a specialized arrow tip for him to use to kill Banner if he gave any indication that he was transforming into the Hulk again.

Months later, when the Inhuman precog [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses Cain]] had a vision that Banner was going to transform into the Hulk and kill everyone, a team of heroes went to Banner's secret lab and tried to calm him down. Beast revealed that Banner had been secretly experimenting on himself with dead gamma cells, but Banner protested the accusation. Seeing his rising level of anger and frustration, Clint, hidden in the bushes nearby loosed the arrow and killed Banner.

For killing Banner, Clint was put on trial for murder{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 3}} and was eventually acquitted.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 4}} Plagued by guilt, Clint decided to leave the city behind and drive across the country on a journey of redemption, looking out to right the type of wrongs superheroes don't usually get involved in. During an adventure investigating the polluted water of an Indian reservation, Hawkeye encountered [[Red Wolf (Earth-51920)|Red Wolf]] who became his partner.{{r|Occupy Avengers Vol 1 #1|2}}

===Secret Empire===
Clint came back into good standing with the rest of the superhero community as he became one of the leaders of the resistance against Hydra when they took over the United States.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} When things went back to normal, he was invited by Kate Bishop to join a new team in Los Angeles which eventually became the new iteration of the West Coast Avengers.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 4}}

===Freefall===
After apprehending [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|the Hood]] during an arms deal, Clint was outraged to learn that the court released him due to corruption in the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|mayor]]'s office. He decided to secretly return to his identity as Ronin to take the Hood down using more extreme methods that didn't fit with his public reputation as Hawkeye. As he kept ambushing various bases of the [[Hood's Gang (Earth-616)|Hood's Gang]], he donated the money he stole from them to help people. One of Hood's employees, a teenager named [[Bryce Bandau (Earth-616)|Bryce Bandau]], was able to deduce that that Ronin was indeed Hawkeye,{{r|Hawkeye: Freefall Vol 1 2}} and Clint brought Bryce on board with his mission.

To operate as Ronin without revealing his true identity he tried a number of methods, which each eventually failed: using a short-range time machine invented by [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]], activating an a [[Life-Model Decoy|LMD]] of himself, and hiring a Skrull impersonator. All of these schemes got out of hand, leading his then-girlfriend, [[Linda Carter (Earth-616)|Linda Carter (the Night Nurse)]] to break up with him. The plan came to a head when Bullseye discovered "Ronin"'s true identity and killed the Skrull Clint had hired, then mortally wounded Bryce.{{r|Hawkeye: Freefall Vol 1 5}} After Bryce's death, Clint held up the bank where all of Parker's money was kept, then used the money to make a deal with Mayor Fisk and [[Luchino Nefaria (Earth-616)|Count Nefaria]] to obtain a [[Demons|demon]], which, during Clint's later confrontation with Parker, stripped Parker of his cloak, effectively depowering him. Hawkeye was finally able to beat him down. After he left the scene, the criminals commented that Clint was "one of [them] now."{{r|Hawkeye: Freefall Vol 1 6}}

| Personality          = Clint is a man who asks a lot of questions and hates authority. He takes his chances to become a superhero. He gets things done if someone he follows has to bend the rules and fight dirty. Clint looks up to [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] as his mentor, though may argue with him most of the time. He tends to be outspoken on many occasions, but he is good-natured, friendly and laid-back at heart.{{r|Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury Vol 1 1}}

| Powers = As Hawkeye or Ronin, Clint possesses no superhuman abilities. Although, because of his abilities, [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]'s intel classified him as power level 4.{{r|Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury #1}}

For some reason, he was affected by the [[Power Drainer]].{{r|New Avengers #57}} [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] [[Jess Harrold (Earth-616)|Agent Harrold]] recommended that Barton's DNA would be analyzed to explain it.{{r|Siege: Storming Asgard - Heroes & Villains #1}}

| title = Former Powers
| body  = '''Size Alteration:''' Thanks to the works of Hank Pym, Barton had the abilities as Goliath to use [[Pym Particles]] to grow to immense size or shrink to tiny proportions. The Particles would interact with the electrical impulses of his brain, creating an organism-wide "growth field" or "reducing field."

The growth process required the rapid acquisition of bodily mass, presumably from an extra-dimensional source. This extra-dimensional mass fortified all of his cellular tissue, including his bones and muscles, enabling him to support his increased weight, and giving him superhuman strength.

Via the shrinking process, Barton could shrink down to a size as low as one-half-inch in height. Usually, he did not compress his mass into his smaller size. Instead, his mass was extended into an extra-physical dimension that is opened by the activating of the Pym Particles, from which the mass would later be reclaimed. Strangely, because his mass was extended extra-dimensionally when he was at reduced size, Barton retained full human-size strength at that size.

Unlike Pym or the Wasp, he was never exposed to Pym Particles long enough to control his size at will, and thus had to use gas capsules infused with the Particles to shrink, grow, or revert to normal size.

In this form, [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]'s intel classified him as power level 7.{{r|Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury #1}}

Throughout the battle against [[Pagon (Earth-616)|'Elektra']] and [[Hand (Earth-616)|The Hand]], he demonstrated great skill in his overall martial ability, holding his own against nearly endless hordes of ninjas.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 31}} This earned him a very respecting compliment from his teammate [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], one of the world's top martial artists.

'''Weapons Proficiency:''' Although he is not known to use melee weapons, Barton's incredible reflexes and hand-eye coordination allow him to easily master most weapons. He also received training in swordsmanship during his youth from the original Swordsman, who was considered one of the greatest experts in sword-fighting the world has ever known. Barton is skilled with swords, knives, nunchakus, staffs, and is one of the few people to be able to properly handle Captain America's [[Captain America's Shield|shield]].

He is classified as an Olympic-level athlete,{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 9}} enabling him to press lift 315 pounds;{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 5}} however, [[Pym Particles]] eventually granted him enhanced strength, and he was shown to push a car off him with just one hand.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 #5}} As Goliath, his strength varied according to the height he achieved: at 10 feet tall, Barton could press lift 1000 pounds, at 25 feet tall he could press lift 10 tons, and at 100 feet tall, Barton could press lift 50 tons, though the taller Barton grew past 25 feet, the more of his strength he had to use simply to support his own enormous mass. While shrinking as Goliath, Barton retained his normal strength.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 9}}
| Weaknesses              = For a time, he was 80% deaf due to an injury sustained while in Crossfire's captivity, but his hearing was restored during his rebirth on [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]]' Counter-Earth. He was again deafened by [[Kazimierz Kazimierczak (Earth-616)|the Clown]], who jammed Hawkeye's own arrows into both of Hawkeye's ears, causing damage to the middle and inner ears.{{r|Hawkeye Vol 4 15}} He remained largely deaf, and used sign language, and lip reading to understand those around him, while using verbal speech to communicate with them.{{r|Hawkeye Vol 4 19}} He later started using hearing aids created by Tony Stark.{{r|All-New Hawkeye #1}}
