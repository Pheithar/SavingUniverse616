| History                 = The Church of the Sheltering Hands was founded by [[Tenfingers (Earth-616)|Tenfingers]], a former member of the ninja clan the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] who stole mystical powers from them when he left the clan. The Church targeted illegal immigrants in [[Chinatown (New York)|Chinatown]], offering them protection in exchange for their total devotion. The Church was also involved in taking control of downtown gangs, extortion and killing. A few months later, Tenfingers applied for federal recognition, in order to acquire legitimacy, tax-extempt and a legally protected front for his operations.{{r|Daredevil Vol 5 2}}

The activities of the Church caught the attention of attorney-at-law [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]], who began to investigate the Church both as an attorney and under his vigilante identity of [[Daredevil]]. He managed to convince [[William Li (Earth-616)|Billy Li]] to testify against the Church in court. Even though some of the followers of the Church failed to kill Billy, who was saved by Daredevil,{{r|Daredevil Vol 5 1}} they then attacked him in the detention level of the Supreme Court and convinced him to not testify, cutting of some of his fingers in the process. One of the members deployed to coerce Billy was [[Samuel Chung (Earth-616)|Sam Chung]], who was secretly the vigilante Blindspot and an ally of Daredevil.{{r|Daredevil Vol 5 2}}

The Church fell apart when a [[Fist (Hand) (Earth-616)|Fist]] of The Hand attacked the church to reclaim the power stolen from them. Tenfingers was killed in the process, while he was trying to escape and leave his followers to die. However the followers were saved, thanks to the efforts of both Daredevil and Blindspot. {{r|Daredevil Vol 5 5}}
