===Origin===
[[File:DeMarr Davis (Earth-616) from West Coast Avengers Vol 2 46 001.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Doorman using his mutant powers]]
Before joining the [[Great Lakes Avengers (Earth-616)|Great Lakes Avengers]], DeMarr Davis was an average American youngster. Sometime during his years in college, DeMarr's mother died. After completing four years of college and three years of graduate school,{{r|GLX-Mas Special #1}} DeMarr decided to answer [[Craig Hollis (Earth-616)|Mr. Immortal]]'s newspaper ad asking "costumed adventurers" to join together and form a team. DeMarr, being a [[Homo superior|mutant]]{{r|G.L.A. #4}} and possessing his unique teleportation ability, allows his teammates an opening into almost any structure, thus creating both a stealthy entrance as well as a surprise attack.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 46}} He joined the original incarnation of the [[Great Lakes Avengers (Earth-616)|Great Lakes Avengers]].{{r|G.L.A. #1}}

===Great Lakes Avengers===
Doorman has been the most cynical of the Great Lakes Avengers, constantly comparing the team to the real [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], usually at the most inappropriate times, and feeling at times embarrassed by his friends. Nonetheless, DeMarr cares for them deeply, and values each and every member of the team. He was responsible for creating the fallen GLA'ers memorial at [[GLA Headquarters|GLA HQ]]. He also still blames himself for the death of one of their newest recruits, the [[Douglas Taggert (Earth-616)|Grasshopper]], who died in battle with [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc]] and his minions. [[Maximillian Zaran (Earth-616)|Zaran]] (one of Batroc's henchmen) threw a sai at Doorman, who quickly activated his powers, only for the blade to land directly in Grasshopper's head, killing him instantly. DeMarr felt that it was his fault that Grasshopper died and therefore sunk into a slight depression. During this time he also tried to scare another new member, [[Doreen Green (Earth-616)|Squirrel Girl]] off of the team because he feared that she too would die while in service to the GLA.{{r|G.L.A. #1|3}}

===Death and Resurrection===
[[File:DeMarr Davis (Earth-616) from GLX-Mas Special Vol 1 1 003.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Doorman after his resurrection]]
Doorman himself has died as well, sacrificing himself so that Mr. Immortal could stop the villain [[Maelstrom (Earth-616)|Maelstrom]]. He met with the other dead GLA'ers in the afterlife including Grasshopper who forgave him. Doorman was however intrigued by the absence of [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]]. Shortly afterward, he was summoned by the cosmic entity [[Oblivion (Earth-616)|Oblivion]], who declared that thanks to Doorman's connection to the [[Darkforce Dimension]], Doorman could prove useful to him, akin to [[Deathurge (Earth-616)|Deathurge]] who had recently been captured by Mr. Immortal. Doorman therefore replaced Deathurge and became Oblivion's new [[Angel of Death]]. Doorman continued to be a member of the GLA although after helping his friends save the world from Maelstrom, he understood the team's importance and had a newfound respect for them. However, a subpoena from the real Avengers forced the team to change their name to the [[X-Men|Great Lakes X-Men or GLX]].{{r|G.L.A. #4}}

[[File:DeMarr Davis (Earth-616) from GLX-Mas Special Vol 1 1 002.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Doorman explains events to [[Mr. Davis (Earth-616)|his father]]]]
Sometime after the battle with Maelstrom, Doorman was celebrating Christmas with the rest of the GLX when he informed the team that he had to go and visit his father. Upon reaching his father's house, his father quickly complained that DeMarr was throwing his life away and needed to join the real world. He told his son that he had "stupid powers" and "all the other heroes have better powers than you." Realizing that his own happiness was more important than his father's respect, DeMarr finally admitted the truth to his father: that he had died and came back as the angel of death. He had not come back to visit his father but rather to collect his soul as he had fallen off the roof while setting up Christmas lights and died. Ironically, the revelation of DeMarr's new role in the universe greatly pleased his father, who couldn't wait to brag to all his friends in heaven about how his son was the new angel of death. Upon returning to the team Doorman kept this secret hidden from his friends, not wishing to ruin the happy holidays that they were having.{{r|GLX-Mas Special #1}}

Doorman and his teammates participated in a charity superhero poker tournament hosted by the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]], where [[Val Ventura (Earth-616)|Flatman]] beat their host in the final round. Flatman's status as champion inspired the team to take the new name of the Great Lakes Champions, after being discouraged from affiliation with both the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] by members of those teams present at the tournament, ignoring former [[Champions of Los Angeles (Earth-616)|Champions of Los Angeles]] member [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules']] protests.{{r|Thing Vol 2 8}}

All of the Great Lakes Champions registered with the [[United States of America|United States]] government as required by the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], becoming the official government-sanctioned protectors of [[Wisconsin (State)|Wisconsin]], the [[Great Lakes Initiative]]. However the GLI team was attacked by [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] in a misbegotten plan to win government favor by bringing in unregistered, rogue superhumans.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #30}}

===The GLA in Detroit===
Sometime later, when Flatman got the Avengers' legal representative [[Connie Ferrari (Earth-616)|Connie Ferrari]] to reinstate the Great Lake Avengers as a permanent and official addition to the Avengers, Doorman was the only former member of the team together with [[Ashley Crawford (Earth-616)|Big Bertha]] who answered his call to bring the team together. Unknown to them Craig's phone was now in possession of a local girl named [[Pansy (Earth-616)|Pansy]]. Unwilling to "assume things," Pansy showed up at the rendezvous point, an abandoned Stark Assembly and Manufacturing plant the Avengers had set up as the GLA new headquarters in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan (State)|Michigan]], and waited for the Great Lakes Avengers. Once they arrived, Pansy cleared up the confusion caused by her presence and showed the team around the facilities.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 1}}

The team's problems began when they had the tremendous idea of going to a local bar in the middle of the night and try to convince them to turn the music volume down. The owner [[Dick Snerd (Earth-616)|Nein Rouge]], secretly councilman Dick Snerd, instead refused and began to insult them. Upon getting arrested after a fight, Doorman escaped and found Mr. Immortal inside a coffin used for voluntary solitary confinement to meditate. He brought him back to the surface, convincing him to help the others.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 2}}

Soon after returning to the team, Doorman was pulled into the Darkforce Dimension, where Oblivion angrily demanded an explanation for his absence.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 3}} Doorman was forced to continue fulfilling his job as Oblivion's servant, but returned to the GLA in order to assist them defeat the supervillain [[Doctor Nod (Earth-616)|Doctor Nod]].{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 6}} He played a key role in Nod's defeat, as he teleported Mister Immortal inside Nod's body and had him punch his heart, causing him to collapse.<!--{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 7}}-->

Even though the city applauded the heroes, the GLA's rejoicing was abruptly cut short when Deadpool appeared on their doorstep and, as a member of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]], told them they were fired, informing them that their legal claim of the name didn't hold up in court. He stated that people simply didn't like them, but comforted them, proclaiming that in a few years they could try to be in the spotlight again.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 7}}

When former GLA member Squirrel girl allegedly died on the line of duty, Doorman was the actual doorman during the funeral ceremony. Due to the nonexistence of a guest list, he just let everybody who showed up get inside.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 37}}

Upon his death, [[Oblivion (Earth-616)|Oblivion]] recruited Doorman to serve as his [[Angel of Death]] because of his connection to the [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce Dimension]]. Oblivion resurrected Doorman and granted him several new powers including:
