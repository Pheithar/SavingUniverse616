| History                 = Sasha Roerich was the second woman to take the name of Darkstar, when she was given the late [[Laynia Petrovna (Earth-616)|Laynia Petrovna]]'s DNA and with it her ability to manipulate the [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]], though Sasha feared using the full extent of her powers. Darkstar, the Winter Guard and [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] helped defend Russia during the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]].{{r|Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 34|#35}}

Sasha eventually began to slip and lose control of her powers after she got angry and killed [[Igor Drenkov (Earth-616)|Igor Drenkov]] after he had killed one of her teammates. Following this, she started experiencing memories from her predecessor and was told to take a break. However, when the Winter Guard was in danger, she went to help them anyway and as a result lost control of her powers, transforming into a void monster. Left with no other option, [[Red Guardian (Anton) (Earth-616)|Red Guardian]] took the amulet that was the source of her powers, and without it, her body was consumed and destroyed by her own powers.{{r|Hulk: Winter Guard Vol 1 1}}
