===Early Life===
Cain Marko is the son of [[Kurt Marko (Earth-616)|Dr. Kurt Marko]], who was an atomic researcher, and [[Marjorie Marko (Earth-616)|Marjorie Marko]]. Cain's parents separated, and his mother died when he was three. Cain was eventually sent to boarding schools, which he continued to get expelled from.{{citation}} Dr. Marko's wealthy colleague, [[Brian Xavier (Earth-616)|Dr. Brian Xavier]], another atomic researcher, died in an accident, and Dr. Marko eventually married his widow, [[Sharon Xavier (Earth-616)|Sharon Xavier]], for her great wealth. On marrying Sharon, Dr. Marko moved into her large [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Westchester County mansion]], and, after yet another expulsion from school, eventually moved Cain in also.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 12}}

Dr. Marko favored his gentle, smart step-son, [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]], to his own son, which led to Cain bullying the young Charles and Dr. Marko secretly beating Cain. Cain was abusive to his stepbrother at every opportunity. Charles' [[Glossary:Telepathy|telepathic]] powers began emerging when he was still a boy, around ten, and, on one occasion, he found himself experiencing the anguished thoughts and emotions of Cain; after Cain had been beaten by his father. The inexperienced young Charles could not control or end his contact with Cain's mind at this time. Somehow, Cain sensed that Charles was reading his mind and had discovered his secret shame.{{r|Marvel Saga the Official History of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 4}}

[[File:Kurt Marko (Earth-616), Cain Marko (Earth-616) and Charles Xavier (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 12 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. Kurt Marko's death]]
Sharon died shortly thereafter, of a broken heart, leaving Charles to live with his step-father and abusive step-brother. During an argument in Dr. Marko's private laboratory over money, Cain accused him of having a hand in Dr. Xavier's "accidental" death, at the disaster at Alamogordo. Dr. Marko was quick to be steadfast in defending himself, taking Cain by the collar of his coat and yelling at him to "never say that again". Charles was stationed outside the door, however, and overheard the conversation. When Cain realized, he intended to cause a ruckus, by destroying some of his father's chemical experiments, throwing a vial of green liquid that caused similar containers to shatter, spilling the chemicals throughout the laboratory. The collision of the different substances caused a violent explosion that left the lab aflame. Though Dr. Marko managed to rescue both Cain and Charles from the fire, he himself died of smoke inhalation. In his dying words, Dr. Marko begged forgiveness for not saving Dr. Xavier when he had the chance, and telling Charles to keep his powers secret from Cain. Cain was standing over, however, and heard of Charles' gift, which led him to believe that Charles had invaded his thoughts deliberately. From then on, Cain regarded Charles as his enemy.<!-- {{r|X-Men Vol 1 12}} -->

Cain continued to live in the Xavier mansion, growing increasingly resentful of his step-brother's scholastic and athletic achievements as well as his telepathic powers (which Charles mastered as he grew older), while Charles entered [[England]]'s [[Oxford University]]. Cain even pushed Charles too far one day and the two got into a fight, which Charles easily won.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 12}} What happened to Marko after he left home was unclear.{{r|Professor Xavier and the X-Men Vol 1 12}} However, it was known that Cain became a mercenary and was eventually imprisoned in a Third World jail when the revolutionary forces he was fighting for were defeated.{{citation}}

===Birth of a Juggernaut===
Later, Marko and Xavier found themselves serving together in the same [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. military]] unit in [[Korea]]. Marko deserted under fire and Xavier went after him to bring him back. Xavier followed Marko into a cave, that housed the lost secret [[Temple of Cyttorak (Korea)|Temple]] of [[Cyttorak (Earth-616)|Cyttorak]], a powerful mystical entity. Marko impulsively grabbed [[Crimson Gem of Cyttorak|a glowing ruby]] from the lap of an idol and read the inscription (which mystically appeared to his mind to be in English): "Whosoever touches this gem shall possess the power of the [[Crimson Bands of Cyttorak]]. Henceforth, you who read these words shall become forevermore a human juggernaut." As Xavier watched, the gem's mystical power transformed Marko into a larger, superhuman being. Just then, enemy high explosive bombardment caused a cave-in and Marko was buried under several thousand tons of rock. Xavier survived and returned to his unit.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 12}}

Due to the fact that he did not need air or food to survive, Marko, now the [[Juggernaut]], eventually dug himself free with his new-found, immense strength and invulnerability. He then confronted the previous man to hold the mantle of the Juggernaut, the local [[Jin Taiko (Earth-616)|Jin Taiko]]. He killed Taiko in order to fully embrace the powers of the Juggernaut, and under the influence of Cyttorak slaughtered Taiko's entire village, since they ceased their worship to him.{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 15}} After many years, Marko made his way to [[United States of America|America]] to use his newfound power to kill Xavier, leaving the gem in Korea. As the Juggernaut, Cain had released his soul to the deity Cyttorak, becoming his human avatar.{{citation}}

[[File:Cain Marko (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 138 001.jpg|thumb|left|The Juggernaut]]
Marko attacked Charles, now a professor and founder of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], at their old home and learned that his new helmet protected him from psychic attacks. Professor Xavier and his group of [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] were helpless to stop him, until Professor Xavier asked for the assistance of the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]], who burned the rivets of Cain's helmet, allowing for the X-Men to removed it.{{r|X-Men #12|13}} After Professor Xavier sent Cain into a coma, he locked him in a room in the basement of the mansion. While attempting to remove the mystic powers of Cain, Professor Xavier placed the two of them in a device and, due to the intervention of the [[Factor Three (Earth-616)|Factor Three]], Cain was revived and temporarily retained Professor X's telepathic powers. After defeating the X-Men, Cain was contacted by the Factor Three for membership. While attempting to join them, Juggernaut was tricked by the X-Men, and sent to the [[Crimson Cosmos]] of the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak.{{r|X-Men #32|33}}

===Prisoner of the Crimson Cosmos===
While attempting to find a pathway back to [[Earth]], Cain made his way to the [[Dream Dimension]] and aided [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]] in battling [[Nightmare (Earth-616)|Nightmare]] to rescue [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]]. After successfully rescuing Eternity, Cain attempted to destroy him and was banished back to the Crimson Cosmos.{{r|Doctor Strange #182}} Due to a number of mystic coincidences, it being Halloween, and his desire for revenge, Cain was briefly returned to Earth, in [[Rutland]], [[Vermont (State)|Vermont]]. The powers that be in the Crimson Cosmos, to teach him an abject lesson, made Cain believe that he was aging rapidly until death. Due to the circumstances of his arrival, Cain was pulled between the Earth dimension and the Crimson Cosmos, while causing chaos in Vermont to regain his youth through hate. Coming to the aid of the citizens of Rutland, the former X-Man [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] battled Juggernaut, who was winning until he realized that Beast's new beastly appearance was real and not a costume. Due to Cain's hate turning to fear, he began to age again and, before he could perish, another portal appeared, returned Cain to imprisonment, and restored him to life when he was brought back to the realm.{{r|Amazing Adventures Vol 2 16}}

While attempting to seal away another rampaging beast, the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], [[Peter Corbeau (Earth-616)|Dr. Peter Corbeau]] sent the Hulk to Cain's mystical dimension and accidentally warped Cain in his place. After Cain attempted to break-out of the Hulk's [[Gamma Base|Hulkbuster Base I]] cell, Dr. Corbeau attempted to reverse the procedure and resulted in the Hulk and Juggernaut in the cell. Together, the pair broke-out of the prison and made short work of all the military force that [[John D. Armbruster (Earth-616)|Colonel John Armbruster]] threw at them, but, when Cain began to terrorize civilians, the Hulk and Juggernaut began an epic battle. The pair were evenly matched until the Hulk grabbed Cain by the helmet and began to spin him around. The speed and force of Hulk's attack was enough for Cain's helmet to snap loose and send him into a mountain. Before Cain could begin his sneak attack retaliation, the X-Men arrived and Professor Xavier mentally subdued him again.{{r|Incredible Hulk 172}}

===Partners in Crime===
Later, Juggernaut was freed and hired to kill the X-Men by [[Davan Shakari (Earth-616)|Erik the Red]]. Together with [[Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616)|Black Tom Cassidy]], the two set a trap for the X-Men, at [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]]'s [[Cassidy Keep]],{{citation}} where Cain first met the X-Man [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]]. Cain proved to be enough to overpower the mutants, but when Black Tom was thrown into the waves below the castle, Cain withdrew and jumped in to try and save him.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 101|103}} Cain and Tom resurfaced in New York, attempting to kidnap [[Cassandra Webb (Earth-616)|Madame Web]], hoping her psychic visions could help defeat the X-Men, but were opposed by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]. Although Spider-Man could not stop Juggernaut from taking Madame Web, he was able to outsmart Cain and leave him in a pool of wet cement at a construction site.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #230}} 

[[File:Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616) and Cain Marko (Earth-616) from Cyclops Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Alongside Black Tom Cassidy]]
Cain eventually made his way out of the cement and was seen again in a bar in [[Manhattan]]. While attempting to forget his defeat, Juggernaut's drinking was interrupted by Colossus, who accidentally spilled his beer on Cain. Eager to let out his frustrations, Cain beat up Colossus, while [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] watched-on. After asking if they wanted a beating too, the other X-Men said "no" and Cain left, paying for his beer.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #183}}

Wishing to improve Tom's defenses, Cain had the idea for what would make for a rather unique birthday present and went to Korea to retrieve the Gem that gave him his powers. After walking through the Korean army, Cain retrieved the gem and gave it to Tom, turning him into a Juggernaut as well. However, both of them had only half of the original’s powers and Black Tom became enraged, engaging his ally in a brief battle, which was then interrupted by Spider-Man and the X-Men. [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] leeched-off Cassidy's Juggernaut powers and, later, Cain reclaimed the full set when he touched the ruby a second time. Realizing that the ruby was not only the source of his strength, but could also be used to take it away from him, Cain decided to hurl it into space where no one could find it to use against him. Cain was later seen at a New York bank conducting a legitimate business transaction, but was attacked by [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]]. This time, Cain was aided by the X-Men, although it appeared to the public the X-Men were aiding a felon.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #194}}

Cain was later seen on [[Muir Island]] by the X-Man [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]], who Cain was a huge fan of musically. Cain was attempting to keep the local authorities busy, while Black Tom looted the Bank of Scotland. Dazzler wished to prove her worth, having recently joined the X-Men, but Cain did not wish to harm the beautiful hero, even offering to pay for damages of an accident they had. Dazzler unleashed the full fury of her powers, passing-out from over exertion, leaving Cain mortified at the thought that he had killed her. After mistakenly burying Dazzler alive, the new group of X-Men defeated Cain and handed him over to the authorities.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #218}}

[[File:Cain Marko (Earth-616) from Excalibur Vol 1 3 0002.jpg|thumb|left|Confronting Captain Britain]]
Cain was sent to the ultra-maximum security prison, Crossmoor, in [[London (England)|London]], until he was freed by the British crime lord [[Vixen (British Crimelord) (Earth-616)|Vixen]]. Vixen offered Cain her help, in exchange for his assistance in her plans. Cain destroyed the prison wall and most of the prisoners escaped, beating up the guards, and also destroyed most of the tanks, while Vixen and her troops flew away with jet packs. Cain was confronted by [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]], who ordered him to give up. Cain overpowered Captain Britain, but was defeated and returned to custody by [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]].{{r|Excalibur #3}}

Cain's reputation as an unstoppable force gained the notoriety of the [[Gods of Earth|Gods]], when [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] had him teleported from Crossmoor to [[Queens]], where Cain began to rampage. Loki's goal, as always, was to have Cain face-off with his brother, [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], which came shortly after. Surprisingly, Cain was able to beat Thor, but the arrival of the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]] gave Thor the time he needed to recover and Cain was covered in molten metal. After the metal cooled, Thor took the temporary prison to an asteroid in space and left Cain.{{r|Thor #412}}

The gem did not stay in space, due to [[Frankie Raye (Earth-616)|Nova]] sending it back to Earth, and a young boy named [[Stevie (Earth-616)|Stevie]] was granted a different set of powers, but still drained Cain's powers. Ironically, while in space, Cain overthrew an [[Glossary:Alien|alien]] [[Juggernaut's planet|planet]] and became its absolute ruler. This time, Cain was stopped by the arrival of Thor and Excalibur, where Cain first displayed his force field and Thor used [[Mjolnir]] to break it and teleported Cain to another asteroid in deep space.{{r|Thor #429}} Cain's partner in crime brokered a deal to get him back to Earth and Black Tom had [[Arianna Jankos (Earth-616)|Arianna Jankos]] build a interdimensional teleporter, in exchange for Black Tom helping Arianna stop a corporate buyout of her company. When activated, the teleporter exploded and out popped Juggernaut. Black Tom planned to aid Arianna, by holding the would-be purchasers hostage in the [[World Trade Center]], but Tom's cousin, [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]], attacked them. Grateful for being back on Earth, Cain gladly fought Siryn outside, until [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]] of [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] arrived to aid her. Realizing the odds were against them, Tom detonated bombs, destroying the [[World Trade Center]]. Arriving to aid their teammate, Cain then battled X-Force and Spider-Man, while [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] attempted to kill Black Tom inside the ruins of the tower. As Tom lay in his own blood, [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] arrived and teleported him and Cain, who was fairing nicely in his battle outside, to [[Tyler Dayspring (Earth-4935)|Mr. Tolliver]], in exchange for their services.{{r|X-Force #4}}

After arriving back on Earth, Cain was initially held at bay by Stevie and it was unknown what became of Stevie, but, apparently, Cain encountered the child a second time and successfully reclaimed his power source. This time, the gem was mystically bonded to Marko and merged with his body, making Cain no longer need his costume to have the full range of his powers, except for the immunity to telepathy granted by his helmet.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #64}}

Later, Cain was summoned to the Crimson Cosmos to aide Dr. Strange and Nova from becoming Cyttorak's priest and priestess. Cyttorak's manifestation seemed to be an elf-like figure, who wore a pointed helmet-like hat with a ruby grafted onto it and, greedy for more power and thinking that this new stone would increase his own abilities, Cain battled his benefactor and ripped the stone out. Strangely, though, he felt no difference and, when Dr. Strange and Nova teamed up against him, they made him drop the glowing jewel and it returned to its rightful place.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #44}}

In the intervening years, the Juggernaut clashed several times with Spider-Man, the Hulk (both as the Merged Hulk and the Horseman of [[War]]), [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]], and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #457}}

===[[Onslaught (Event)|Onslaught]]===
The sentient psionic being known as [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], actually an amalgamation of the psyches of Xavier and [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], ripped the [[Crimson Gem of Cyttorak]] from Juggernaut's body and imprisoned him within it. Inside the jewel, Cain learned he was an avatar for Cyttorak. As such, the otherworldly entity sought to assume control of Juggernaut's form. But Cain, through sheer force of will, destroyed the evil god and returned to Earth, stronger than ever, but unable to fully control his amplified abilities.{{r|X-Men Unlimited #12}}

===Eighth Day: The Octessence===
[[Cyttorak (Earth-616)|Cyttorak]] was merely one of a pantheon of eight gods, all with earthbound avatars. These [[Exemplars (Earth-616)|Exemplars]] enlisted the Juggernaut's aid in constructing a machine that would enslave the human race. As the Exemplars tended to their final preparations, Cain withdrew deep into himself, where he clashed with Cyttorak. Charles entered his stepbrother's mind to aid him in the battle, but the Exemplar known as [[Olisa Kabaki (Earth-616)|Bedlam]] sensed his presence and expelled him. Still, Charles' short stay in Juggernaut's head had helped Cain regain control of his psyche. After defeating Cyttorak, Juggernaut destroyed the Exemplars' [[God Machine]]. He then turned his attention to the avatars themselves, defeating each in turn.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 2 1}}

===X-Men Forever===
Juggernaut again was cast as a hero when the sentient spaceship [[Prosh (Earth-616)|Prosh]] escaped the confines of a [[Celestials|Celestial]] prison, returned to Earth, and dispatched a group of disparate beings on a journey through time to uncover the keys to preserving human evolution. Besides Cain, Prosh's task force included [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] and [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], members of the X-Men; and [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] and [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]], mutant terrorists. Their mission: save the human race from a threat that might not manifest itself for millions of years. Juggernaut was shown that for all his physical strength, he long had lacked strength of character. Despite all his yearning for power, he had squandered his supernaturally enhanced abilities. When Prosh reassembled the members of his team in the present, they fought and defeated the enigmatic alien entity known as the [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]], who sought to control the natural evolution of humans and mutants. If not acquiring a new-found respect for life and human dignity, at least Juggernaut gained a better sense of understanding for the mutant plight.{{r|X-Men Forever #6}} 

===Life as a X-Man===
[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 435 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|X-Men outfit]]
As the result of an undisclosed battle with Cyttorak, his patron deity, Cain lost most of the power of the Juggernaut. Thereafter, Cain reconciled with Xavier and joined the X-Men. In an unusual turn for someone of Cain's personality, he immediately befriended several people at the mansion including a young mutant boy named Sammy Pare, a.k.a. [[Samuel Paré (Earth-616)|Squidboy]], who had a positive influence on him. Cain later allowed himself to be taken into custody and then had a one-night stand with [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-721)|She-Hulk]], who as Jennifer Walters was representing him in his trial for all the crimes he had committed as a criminal.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #436}} (It would turn out later that it was, in fact, an "Earth A" alternate of Ms. Walters {{r|She-Hulk Vol 2 21}}). Amazingly, Cain was exonerated of all his crimes and allowed to go free despite having numerous outstanding felonies both at home and abroad.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #436}}

Later, Black Tom Cassidy resurfaced and Juggernaut joined his new [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Mutants]], with the intention of betraying the group and warning the X-Men when he had the chance. Squidboy stumbled upon the Brotherhood having a meeting and thinking that Juggernaut had betrayed the X-Men he became angry and started yelling. Annoyed, Black Tom killed the boy. Furious with rage, Juggernaut tried to kill his former friend. When the Brotherhood were sucked into a black hole by the second [[Shen Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]], Juggernaut accompanied them to make sure [[Talia Wagner (Earth-2182)|Nocturne]] (another mole) would be safe if everyone survived and to make sure the Brotherhood didn't try to attack the mansion again.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 164}}

He ended up in [[Mojoworld]] and became the property of [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]] along with Nocturne. To escape, Nocturne took control of Mojo's henchwoman, [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]], and opened a portal to the X-Men's [[Danger Room]], where they were reunited with the team. This, however, was a trap set by Spiral, who was in more control of her body than thought, leaving a portal open to allow Mojo to cross over as well. Mojo turned the X-Men into [[X-Babies (Mojoverse)|X-Babies]], but they managed to overpower his forces anyway. Juggernaut still felt extremely guilty about Squidboy's death, and how the boy's last words were that he hated him. He wondered if he should remain a child, this being his chance to start over with a clean slate, but [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] comforted him and convinced him not to. The X-Men were re-aged, and Juggernaut remained with the team.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #461}}

In the wake of [[House of M]], in which the majority of the mutant population lost their powers, Juggernaut joined the new [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] grouping in [[London (England)|London]].{{r|New Excalibur #5|24}}

===[[World War Hulk]]===
Cain was among the various teams of X-Men attempting to protect Professor Xavier from the wrath of the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]. Though Cain had recently come into possession of the gem of Cyttorak, he was still unable to call forth his full power during his first battle with the Hulk and was quickly defeated. Cyttorak himself appeared before Cain and explained that Cain himself was the cause of his own weakness. Cyttorak intended for Cain to use the powers granted to him to fulfill his own selfish desires and needs and not for heroic purposes. Cain finally accepted his role as Cyttorak's avatar to its fullest extent and regained his full power. He challenged the Hulk once more and the Hulk was unable to defeat him once again. As Cain continued to push the Hulk back, the Hulk used his cunning to use Cain's own momentum and near-unstoppable movement against him, which briefly removed him from the field of battle long enough for the Hulk to escape. Shortly afterward, Cain refused all of Xavier's attempts to thank him. Before leaving, he gave Xavier a warning not to send anyone to try to find him.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 2|3}}

Cain later engaged [[Skaar (Earth-616)|Skaar]], the son of the Hulk, in a fight, being ultimately defeated and launched into orbit.{{r|Incredible Hulk #602}}

[[File:Cain Marko (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 629 0001.jpg|thumb|left|As Captain Universe]]
===Captain Universe===
Cain was later found unconscious by Spider-Man. The government arrived soon afterwards and transported him to a prison. When Spider-Man went to the facility to ask the Juggernaut who had done that to him, a new [[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]] broke into the room and claimed he was there to slay the Juggernaut. Spider-Man learned that this new Captain Universe was a man named [[William Nguyen (Earth-616)|William Nguyen]], who wanted revenge on Juggernaut for ruining his life during his previous fight with Spider-Man over Madame Web. When Nguyen insisted on trying to kill Juggernaut instead of fixing the tectonic plates beneath New York City as instructed by the [[Glossary:Enigma Force|Enigma Force]], the power left him for the Juggernaut. As Captain Universe, Juggernaut repaired the tectonic plates, which had been damaged by him during the same rampage that ruined Nguyen's life, and apologized to Nguyen for ruining his life. The Enigma Force left shortly thereafter, as it wasn't needed there anymore.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 627|629}}

===Thunderbolts===
After the [[Siege (Event)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]], Cain became a member of Luke Cage's [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]].{{r|Thunderbolts #144}}

When the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]] was freed by [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Skadi]], he called seven hammers to Earth. The Juggernaut was transformed by one of these hammers into one of the [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]]: [[Kuurth (Earth-616)|Kuurth, Breaker of Stone]]. He then heavily damaged the [[Raft]], allowing many prisoners to escape before flying away.{{r|Fear Itself #2}}

After this, Cain, now Kuurth, attacked a petrol station 60 miles from San Francisco, gaining an ally who he possessed. As Kuurth continued towards San Francisco, he met with the police force on the highway who attempted to stop his rampage. After Kuurth's ally gained the influence of the anti mutant protesters, Marko was directly attacked by the first wave of X-Men, [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]], Colossus, and Iceman. While Colossus managed to crack Kuurth's helmet, he was unsuccessful in removing the helmet, which needed to be done to allow [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] to telepathically control him. This team was later joined by Magneto, who was unable to stop Kuurth's hammer using his magnetism, but was saved from death by an interfering Kitty Pryde. Cain couldn't be stopped by the first team and so was next attacked by an aerial force consisting of [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]], [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]], Storm, and Dazzler. During this time, [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]] had absorbed almost every X-Man's power and battled Marko, managing to remove his helmet before collapsing. Emma Frost then tried to take control of his mind but was overpowered by Kuurth and his ally.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #543}}

During the last battle between the Avengers and the Worthy, Kuurth was defeated by Wolverine using his Uru armor, and lost his hammer when the Serpent was killed by Thor. After losing his hammer and blessing of Cyttorak, Cain was re-imprisoned in the Raft. He was later confronted by a pair of guards, who taunted him for the loss of his powers. [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|John Walker]] the warden appeared, admonishing the guards and dismissing them. He then offered Cain his former spot on the Thunderbolts. [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]] managed to use his access to the [[Nexus of All Realities]] to teleport to [[Earth-616]] a Cyttorak from another universe in which Marko was dead, thus becoming Juggernaut once more.{{r|Dark Avengers #180}}

This power was revealed to be temporary however, and Cain soon lost the blessing. Fellow Thunderbolt Man-Thing offered to send Cain and the other Thunderbolts to a location of their choice. Cain chose a place with a lot of open landscape for him to roam in before the powers of the Juggernaut left him completely.{{r|Dark Avengers #181}}

===The Once and Future Juggernaut===
While the Juggernaut's powers eventually left him, Cain still retained some level of super strength. He relocated to a farm in [[Utah (State)|Utah]], where he lived peacefully and, at some point, heard that Charles Xavier had died. When Cyttorak sent [[Crimson Gem of Cyttorak|his gem]] back to Earth to find a new host for him, Cain was one of the many individuals throughout the world who heard its call. Determined to destroy the gem, he took various weapons and contracted [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]] to take him to the [[Temple of Cyttorak (Thailand)|Temple of Cyttorak]] in [[Thailand]], where the gem rested. They arrived just as the X-Men and many others were fighting for the gem.{{r|Amazing X-Men Vol 2 16}}

As Vanisher teleported away, Cain battled the mercenaries there and knocked [[Katrina van Horn (Earth-616)|Man-Killer]] out of the temple. He turned his attention to the X-Men afterwards, attacking them and demanding them to admit that they killed his brother. Cain only stopped attacking them when [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]] told him that it was Cyclops who had killed Xavier. Cain was about to destroy the gem, which he had just found, when he was attacked by Colossus, who also wanted to destroy the gem, but thought he wanted its power for himself. They battled until the [[Ahmet Abdol (Earth-616)|Living Monolith]] claimed both the gem and the power of Juggernaut for himself.{{r|Amazing X-Men Vol 2 17}}

[[File:Amazing X-Men Vol 2 19 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Battle for the power of Cyttorak]]
While Abdol showed off his newfound powers, Marko stayed behind with the X-Men as they tried to figure out a way to defeat the new Juggernaut. Colossus eventually came with the idea of calling Cyttorak to strike a deal with him. Once in front of the Crimson Demon, Colossus defied him to give him enough power to kill even him himself and they would fight to the death, but he instead gave it to Marko, who became Juggernaut once again. With more power than ever before, Marko defeated Abdol.{{r|Amazing X-Men Vol 2 18}}

Although he had enough power to kill Cyttorak, Cain only wanted to kill the man who killed his brother: Cyclops. The X-Men tried to stop him, but he easily defeated them. He was then confronted by Colossus, who tried to remind him that he wanted to destroy the gem, but Cain didn't listen. Juggernaut easily punched him miles away and attacked him again, but Colossus managed to trick him into destroying the ground he stood on and Cain fell off a cliff, being buried alive by the very ground he had destroyed. Marko eventually managed to dig himself out of it.{{r|Amazing X-Men Vol 2 19}}

===[[ResurrXion]]===
The Juggernaut resurfaced once more, aiding his old friend Black Tom Cassidy in dealing with [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|the time-displaced X-Men]]. Upon spotting Cyclops, Marko went on a rampage, vowing revenge against him, mistaking him for the older Cyclops. Realizing that Juggernaut's rampage would endanger the boat they were on along with the crew and passengers, Beast was forced to use dark magic to send the Juggernaut to [[Siberia]] via a portal through [[Hell]], something Cyclops wasn't happy about.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Despicable Deadpool Vol 1 298 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Vs. Deadpool]]
Eventually making his way to [[Manhattan]], the Juggernaut attacked the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach]] in the hopes of getting revenge on the young X-Men, unaware that they didn't reside there anymore. Following his defeat at the hands of [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|the older Iceman]],{{r|Iceman Vol 3 5}} the Juggernaut was accidentally summoned to the [[Avengers Mansion]] alongside the [[Cyttora]] by [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Doctor Voodoo]] of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]]. After [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]]'s recklessness almost got [[Emily Guerrero (Earth-616)|Synapse]] killed, Doctor Voodoo commanded the Cyttora to seal the Juggernaut inside his own armor and banished him.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 28|29}} He later returned to Earth and tried to collect a twenty million dollars bounty that had been put on [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]]'s head, but the Merc With a Mouth ran over him with a concrete truck and buried him under its contents.{{r|Despicable Deadpool Vol 1 298}}

===Disciple of Cyttorak===
Becoming Cyttorak's champion on Earth again, Juggernaut joined the cannibalistic [[Disciples of Cyttorak (Earth-616)|Disciples of Cyttorak]] at the [[Temple of Cyttorak (Thailand)|Temple of Cyttorak]] in [[Thailand]]. When Thor invaded their temple to reclaim the [[Warlock's Eye]], an ancient weapon of mind control that fell to Earth following [[Asgardia]]'s destruction, the Juggernaut opposed him, for the cult wanted to use the weapon to conquer the whole world for their master. It took all of Thor's newly created enchanted hammers to put the Juggernaut down.{{r|Thor Vol 5 1}}

The Juggernaut's defeat at the hands of Thor made Cyttorak question whether or not he was still worthy of being his avatar. Thus, Cyttorak decided to test him in an illusory world created by his other disciples. With the help of a younger version of himself manifested by his mind, Cain let go of the restraints he subconsciously held onto for years and unleashed his full power at Cyttorak, finally passing the test. However, Cain didn't like Cyttorak messing with his head, and decided to search for the other seven Gems of Cyttorak to make his master pay for what he had done.{{r|X-Men: Black - Juggernaut Vol 1 1}}

During the [[War of the Realms]], the Juggernaut was captured by [[Frost Giants]] and taken to [[Jotunheim]] so their wizards could rob him of Cyttorak's power. After the war was over, the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] and [[Franklin Nelson (Earth-616)|Foggy Nelson]] freed and recruited him to hunt the monsters who had escaped the final battle on Midgard; a quest which they eventually completed.{{r|Punisher Kill Krew Vol 1 2|5}}

===The Threat of O*N*E===
As a member of a new incarnation of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants led by Magneto, the Juggernaut attacked an Air Force base in [[East Transia]]. The X-Men soon showed up to stop them and both groups battled until Magneto's helmet was knocked off his head, revealing to everyone that he was actually [[Joseph (Earth-616)|Joseph]] in disguise. This made Juggernaut so mad he ended up knocking Joseph to the ground as [[St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616)|Pyro]] shot his flamethrower at him to brand him a traitor. The battle was over after Cyclops knocked Pyro out. Juggernaut held Joseph in place while telling Cyclops that he was doing this for mutants and wanted to become an X-Man again.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 16}}

[[File:Cain Marko (Earth-616) and Hope Summers (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 20 001.png|thumb|left|250px|Juggernaut and Hope Summers vs. Fabian Cortez]]
Juggernaut went on to perform a number of missions to help Cyclops tie up loose ends as part of the X-Men's last mission. This eventually culminated in Emma Frost, who had previously erased her existence from everyone’s mind except Cain, calling in the X-Men to help her escape [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]]. As the X-Men stormed their headquarters, [[Robert Callahan (Earth-616)|General Callahan]] set off a gene bomb in Magik's head that suppressed the power of her X-Gene and unleashed the Darkchylde. While the remainder of the X-Men surrendered, Juggernaut confronted his former ally, who proceeded to grab his Cyttorak Gem and crush it, leaving him powerless before condemning him to [[Limbo (Otherplace)|Limbo]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 17|21}}

===New Lease on Life===
Trapped in Limbo, a powerless Cain dragged his armor along as he tried to find a way out. He was ultimately able to exit Limbo and entered the [[Crossroads (Dimension)|Crossroads]], where he sacrificed his armor to get home.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 1}} At a hospital, Charles visited a recovering Cain via a telepathic projection, wanting to know if he was alright, but sadly was forced to deny Cain from becoming a citizen of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. After fully recovering Cain was determined to regain his powers as Juggernaut and went to a forgotten shrine dedicated to Cyttorak in [[Budapest]].{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 2}} He then went to the [[Forge of Cyttorak]] in the mountains of North Korea, where a blacksmith was forging some [[Crimson Bands of Cyttorak]] in hopes of becoming the demon's new host. The blacksmith attacked Cain, but Cyttorak bonded Marko to the bands, giving him a new suit of armor.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 3}} Cain then busted into a storage facility ran by O*N*E where the remains of the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak were held. Despite the gem being in pieces, the pieces still contained power, allowing Marko to regain his powers. However, during a meeting with Cyttorak, Marko told him that he would no longer work for him and that he wasn't linked to him due to the his armor made from Bands of Cyttorak found on Earth. Marko then vowed to no longer work for gods or madmen anymore.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 4}}

Some months later, he got a job working for [[Damage Control (Earth-616)|Damage Control]] by helping remove rubble and bringing down buildings needing demolishing. After having rocks thrown at him by homeless teenagers that lived in an area he was working in, he discovered one of the teenagers named [[Miranda Manuel (Earth-616)|D-Cel]] had powers after being forced back by a force field. Cain assumed D-Cel was a mutant and searched for her, believing that she needed help. After another confrontation with D-Cel, Cain realized that her power was the ability to slow down kinetic forces. Cain fought against D-Cel until she wore herself out, but he then lost control and crashed into a wall, burying himself and D-Cel under rubble. Marko dug her out and took D-Cel to [[Bellevue Hospital]] to recuperate. There, Marko learned that D-Cel wasn't a mutant; instead, she got her powers from an unspecified accident.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 1}} 

He alongside D-Cel and Damage Control, confronted the Hulk, and despite the Hulk getting the upper hand at first, Juggernaut was able to knock out the Hulk thanks to the combined effort of D-Cel and Damage Control's gamma absorbing device. They then presented the imprisoned Hulk to the victims of his various rampages, but after the Hulk was done listening he broke out and explained that it wasn't his fault for destroying their lives, since he had the mind of a child at the time, and then accused Juggernaut of also acting as he did in the past. This affected Juggernaut as he felt guilty, since he had also destroyed people's lives, but of his own free will, while aware of his actions. After returning to Manhattan, Juggernaut was sued for twenty five million dollars due to causing the bankruptcy of a construction company.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 2}} During the court proceedings, they were assaulted by [[Quicksand (Nguyet) (Earth-616)|Quicksand]] controlled by [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]] who wanted to get his hands on D-Cel. After Cain defeated Quicksand, Cain's lawyer [[Bernadette Rosenthal (Earth-616)|Bernie Rosenthal]] was able to convince the person suing him to settle the case out of court. Cain then learned that Quicksand had been mind-controlled by [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]] who worked for the company [[Absolution Solutions (Earth-616)|Absolution Solutions]] to experiment on superhuman prisoners.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 3}}

Zola was tracked to a bunker formerly used by the villainous team [[Factor Three (Earth-616)|Factor-3]]. Marko smashed his way into the bunker to stop Zola, but he was quickly overwhelmed by Zola's shapeshifting android [[Primus (Android) (Earth-616)|Primus]]. D-Cel went in to help Marko, but she was also captured by Primus. Zola was about to remove part of her brain to analyze her status as a mutant when Marko busted free from his confinement and took out Primus and Zola, rescuing D-Cel.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 4}}

Cain then took his fight to Absolution Solutions. Before that, he convinced D-Cel to finally admit that she was a mutant who then explained that she accidentally killed her parents when her powers first manifested and denied being a mutant so she didn't feel like she killed her parents. The next day, Cain and D-Cel attacked Absolution Solutions' [[Dungeon Max Penitentiary]] in [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]] to put a stop to the company's experimentation on superhuman prisoners. After busting into the penitentiary, he discovered that it was just a front and was used simply as a place to transport prisoners to another prison called the [[Dungeon]] through the use of a teleporter. Juggernaut passed through the teleporter without D-Cel and was confronted by the Dungeon's warden. After Juggernaut was immobilized by a combination of [[Fritz von Meyer (Earth-616)|Swarm]]'s bees and [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]]'s paralytic resin, D-Cel passed through the teleporter and rescued Juggernaut.<!-- {{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 5}} -->

Juggernaut tried to leave with D-Cel, but he discovered that the Dungeon was actually a [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]] converted into a prison. Juggernaut then learned from the warden that the Dungeon was backed by the government and thus Juggernaut couldn't legally take it out. To protect D-Cel from imprisonment and experimentation, he convinced her to admit that she was a mutant and ask for asylum on the mutant-only nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. Days after making sure D-Cel made it safely to Krakoa, Juggernaut forced Zola and Primus to restore Quicksand using remains of her recovered by Damage Control. Juggernaut convinced Quicksand not to attack Zola and instead help him ensure that superhuman prisoners weren't mistreated.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 5}}

| Powers                  = '''Demonic Empowerment:''' after losing the the Gem of Cyttorak along with his powers, Cain bonded to the [[Crimson Bands of Cyttorak]]{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 3}} found on Earth and repowered using the pieces of the Gem of Cyttorak,{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 4}} seemingly giving the following powers:
* '''Superhuman Strength:'''

* '''Summoning:''' Juggernaut can summon his specialized armor at any time he wants.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 3}}

| body  = '''Demonic Empowerment:''' The [[Crimson Gem of Cyttorak]] bonds to the user's soul and makes him the Avatar of Cyttorak, an Exemplar, by giving him this new body. He was stated to be a [[Thor]]-class threat.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #541}} According to [[Prosh (Earth-616)|Prosh]], his Comparative Mutagenic Power Register was of 8.9.{{r|X-Men Forever #1}}
As far, he has displayed the following powers:
* '''Nigh-Limitless Strength:''' The Juggernaut is sometimes listed to possess virtually limitless superhuman strength,{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #1}} and other times simply as class 90 or 100.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #1}} Using this strength he was able to knock out the Thing with three blows,{{r|Secret Wars II #7}} Colossus,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 183}} and even the Merged Hulk (through repeated surprise ambush tactics){{r|Incredible Hulk #402}} and Thor.{{r|Thor Vol 1 411}} He proved strong enough to match the highly strong Prime in a fight,{{r|All New Exiles Vol 1 4}} knocked out several mutants with a thunderclap,{{r|Generation X #61}} and even toppled the Stranger with one punch after he grew to about 50 feet tall.{{r|X-Men Forever Vol 1 6}} He was able to go toe to toe against an enraged World War Hulk{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 3}} as well against the Mighty Thor.{{r|Thor #412}}{{r|Thor Vol 2 17}} Also, when empowered greatly by absorbing energies from a magical universe, he broke multiple dimensional barriers and was able to split the space-time whose fissure was expanding through the universe in which he was.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 88}}
* '''Limitless Stamina:''' Juggernaut's body generates no fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting him nigh limitless stamina in all physical activities.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #1}}
* '''Invulnerability:''' With his force field active, Cain is virtually invulnerable to all forms of physical injury.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #1}} Cain can be harmed by high-level mental attacks, mystical attacks, or weapons with mystical properties. When The Juggernaut's force field was negated by [[Mjolnir]], he was still durable enough to exchange blows with Thor.{{r|Thor Vol 1 429}}
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Despite of his invulnerability, it is possible that Juggernaut can be injured. If damaged, Cain possesses a regenerative healing factor that enables him to completely regenerate with superhuman speed. For instance, he has been injured by [[Shatterstar]]'s sword, and healed instantly.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 16}} The demon being [[D'Spayre]] once flayed the Juggernaut down to a skeleton after draining him, and even then, the Juggernaut was able to regenerate all the damage done once he regained his full power.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 1 1}}
* '''Self-Sustenance:''' The Juggernaut is completely self sustained, he has no need to breathe, eat, or drink.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 629}} He does not tire, hence he cannot sleep, however his self generating mystical energies provide him with the nourishment of sleep, nutrition, hydration, and oxygen. He is sustained by his mystical energies alone. He once even kept talking and fighting after being reduced to a skeleton.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 1 1}}
* '''Immortality:''' The Juggernaut is immune to aging and has sometimes been depicted or implied to be unkillable under normal means.
* '''Contaminant Immunity:''' The Juggernaut is also immune to all toxins, poisons, and disease.{{citation}}
* '''Force-Field:''' The Juggernaut is capable of generating a personal force field around himself, which greatly enhances his physical durability, to the point that the field was even able to withstand Mjolnir{{r|Thor Vol 1 411}} and Thor's god-blast.{{r|Thor Vol 1 412}}
* '''Irresistible Force Embodiment:''' Once he begins to advance in a certain direction, it is virtually impossible to halt his movement.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 5}} Some obstacles such as many tons of rocks and plasma-discharge cannons have slowed his pace but can't completely halt him.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 5}} Thor's use of his god-blast allowed him to stop Juggernaut in his tracks.{{r|Thor Vol 1 411}} During a battle with "War Hulk", the mutant [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] increased the Hulk's strength by grafting Celestial tech to him, which allowed Hulk to increase his strength at will, thereby enabling him to stop the Juggernaut.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 457}}
}}
| Abilities               = Juggernaut is able to summon and remove his mystic armor at will.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 70}} As a result of his days in the military and his experiences as a superhuman, the Juggernaut is a formidable hand to hand combatant preferring to use street fighting and brawling techniques that allow him to make full use of his great strength.
| Strength                = Class 100+ (estimated).{{citation}} The exact limit of Juggernaut's strength varies, depending on the level of power Cyttorak chooses to let him access.{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 12}}
Even after losing Cyttorak's enchantment, he sustained a certain amount of Super Strength, enough to go toe-to-toe with Colossus.{{r|Amazing X-Men Vol 2 17}}
| Weaknesses              = Cain was susceptible to exceedingly high levels of mental and mystical attack. For example, Mjolnir once was able to absorb and negate Cain's formerly impenetrable magic Force Field. Both types of attacks were able to harm him, but neither were shown to cause any type of permanent injury. His weakness to mental attacks was typically nullified by his helmet, but after his latest upgrade, he is now completely immune to psychic assault even without his helmet.{{r|Amazing X-Men Vol 2 19}}

If Juggernaut does not use his powers in a manner approved of by Cyttorak, the power of the gem does not work correctly, essentially making him a human with only a portion of some of his powers.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 3}} Also, being infused with unstoppable force can be used against him, as Hulk did during one of their battles, deflecting Cain's charge, causing him to speed away, unable to stop himself.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 3}}

| Equipment               = '''Juggernaut Armor:''' After being stripped of his powers, Cain was imbued with new powers after bonding to the [[Crimson Bands of Cyttorak]], which formed a new armor that Marko could manifest at will.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 3}}
