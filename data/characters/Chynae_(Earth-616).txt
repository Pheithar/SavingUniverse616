Chynae was part of an [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] squad led by [[Triton (Earth-616)|Triton]] who was being attacked by a regiment of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] soldiers in [[Central Park]]. With two of their members down, Chynae began using her hydrokinetic abilities to knock out a couple of enemies when a blast from an A.I.M. soldier's rifle was about to hit her until it was reflected by [[Steve Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]'s shield. With help from Cap and [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]], Chynae and Triton were able to stop the attack.{{r|Inhuman #2}}
