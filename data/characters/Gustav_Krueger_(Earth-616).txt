===Serpent Society===
Hailing from Poland, Gustav Krueger was given a bionic tail which he uses to create shock waves and vibrations. The details and motivations of this are unclear. Krueger joined the [[Serpent Society (Earth-616)|Serpent Society]], a mercenary organization for criminals styled around snakes, under the leadership of [[Sidewinder]]. During the Rattler's initiation into the Serpent Society, he and his fellow Serpents [[Klaus Voorhees (Earth-616)|Cobra]] and [[Blanche Sitznski (Earth-616)|Anaconda]] were ambushed by the hero [[Steve Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], but Rattler was able to use his tail to stop Captain America's shield from doing any damage.{{r|Captain America #310}}

He later battled Captain America again after being tricked by the [[Alexander Gentry (Earth-616)|Porcupine]] to a trap: Porcupine told the Society he had captured Captain America and Rattler went for the body along with [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]], [[Roland Burroughs (Earth-616)|Death Adder]], and [[Burchell Clemens (Earth-616)|Cottonmouth]]. During the ensuing fight with Captain America, Rattler used his bionic tail to send vibrations coursing through the hero's body, disorienting him. However, he was eventually thrown into a pillar by his tail, knocking him out for the battle.{{r|Captain America #315}}
 
The Rattler joined [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]] during her invasion of the Serpent Society, and then followed King Cobra's instructions when he became leader.{{r|Captain America #342|344}} During the battle with the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] after [[Longshot (Mojoverse)]] had found the missing artifact they were searching for, Rattler created an avalanche by rattling his tail. Unfortunately, it took both Longshot and Rattler out in the process.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 13}}

He was very popular with the ladies of the Serpent Society, as [[Tanya Sealy (Earth-616)|Black Mamba]] recommended him to Diamondback for a "good time," and Diamondback later tried to set [[Teresa Vasquez (Earth-616)|Fer-de-Lance]] up with him. 

===Civil War===
Recently, Rattler joined the group of criminals aiding the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] during the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], alongside fellow Serpent Society members Cobra and [[Quincy McIver (Earth-616)|Bushmaster]].{{r|Thunderbolts #104}}

===New Serpent Society===
He was seemingly killed by the new [[Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616)|Scourge]], who found him about to commit a robbery,{{r|Captain America Vol 6 #12}} but he later turned up alive as a member of the new Serpent Society formed by the new [[Piet Voorhees (Earth-616)|Cobra]].{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson Vol 1 4}}

===Hunted===
Rattler was among several animal-themed super-villains captured by Taskmaster and [[Eric O'Grady (LMD) (Earth-616)|Black Ant]] to serve as hunting targets in [[Central Park]] for a host of wealthy participants controlling robotic drones, part of a plot concocted by [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]] and [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]]. When the force field keeping the criminals inside Central Park dissipated, several superheroes ambushed and apprehended Rattler and the other escaped villains.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 23}}

===Criminal Technology Show Expo===
Rattler, with several other members of the Serpent Society, attended the Criminal Technology Show Expo. Rattler and his teammates went to the restroom where they were ambushed by [[M.O.D.O.K. Superior (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]] and beaten to near death. [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], working with M.O.D.O.K., suggested they hide the villains before they regain consciousness. King Cobra later discovered them and alerted the rest of the supervillains of M.O.D.O.K.'s and Iron Man's presence.{{r|M.O.D.O.K.: Head Games Vol 1 2}}

| Powers                  = '''Rattler's Tail''': Rattler can cybernetically control his seven-foot-long bionic tail and use it as a fifth limb, enabling him to grip objects between eight and 18 inches in diameter. Rattler can use his tail to support himself and up to 300 extra pounds in weight, and can also use his tail as a bludgeon. He can strike with sufficient force to puncture two-inch thick steel plate in three blows. 

'''Sonic Shock Waves''': By shaking his tail back and forth, Rattler can activate devices within its "rattle" to create sonic shock waves of variable intensity. At low intensity, these vibrations can induce disorientation and vertigo in anyone within a range of about 25 feet. At maximum intensity the vibrations create a unidirectional shock wave that can shatter glass, deform soft metals, and deflect projectiles. To deflect projectiles, Rattler must be at least ten feet away from the projectile's point of origin. Human beings standing closer than ten feet to him when he vibrates his tail at maximum intensity risk losing consciousness, internal haemorrhaging, and even death. His tail makes a sharp rattling sound when he vibrates it.
