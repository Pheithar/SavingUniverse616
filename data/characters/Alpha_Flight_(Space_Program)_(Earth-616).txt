In the dawn of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s take-over of the [[United States of America|United States]], a [[Planetary Defense Shield]] was projected around the Earth to seal off the planet, leaving the Alpha Flight Space Station stuck between the impenetrable barrier and a relentless ongoing [[Chitauri]] invasion. In a last ditch effort to bring down the Shield, the A.F.S.S. was repurposed into the delivery system for countless explosive charges that were detonated in the surface of the Shield. The station was destroyed, but the Shield remained unscathed.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 #0|8}}

Following the eventual destruction of the Shield and the end of Hydra's regime,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 #8|10}} the staff of Alpha Flight found themselves grounded. [[Columbia University]] became the temporary home of Alpha Flight until the program could be reinstated.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 125}}

When Carol's lineage as a [[Kree]] became public, Carol decided it was best to step down as Commander of Alpha Flight and asked Brand to take over, which she reluctantly accepted.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 9}} Brand quickly became disgruntled with the handling of the program, namely by the reduced funding and secrecy of the governments behind it. After she quit, [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Gyrich]] was appointed acting commander.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1}}
