===Early Life===
Scott Lang was born and raised in [[Coral Gables]], [[Florida (State)|Florida]], the son of [[Robert Lang (Earth-616)|Bob Lang]].{{r|Ant-Man: Last Days #1}} He later became an electronic engineer and met and married [[Peggy Rae Burdick (Earth-616)|Peggy Rae]]. Together they had a daughter [[Cassandra Lang (Earth-616)|Cassandra "Cassie" Lang]]. Although he was an electronics expert he could not support his family doing repair work, so he turned his talents to burglary. Apprehended, he served his prison sentence and was paroled for good behavior. During his time in prison, however, Peggy divorced him. Lang had furthered his studies of electronics while in prison and was soon hired by [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark International]] to work in its design department.{{r|Avengers #181}}

[[File:Scott Lang (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 15 0001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|"New Ant-Man"]]
===Ant-Man===
When his daughter Cassie was diagnosed as having a serious congenital heart condition, Lang sought the aid of surgeon [[Erica Sondheim (Earth-616)|Dr. Erica Sondheim]]. Desperate to help his daughter, Lang decided to return to thievery.{{r|Marvel Premiere #47}} Breaking into the [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]] home of Dr. [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]], Lang stole [[Ant-Man's Suit]]. Unknown to him, Pym observed the theft and in his guise as Yellowjacket, followed Lang, curious to see what use he would put the paraphernalia.{{r|Marvel Premiere #47}}

Garbed as Ant-Man, Lang broke into Cross and discovered Dr. Sondheim was held prisoner by [[Darren Cross (Earth-616)|Darren Cross]], president of CTE, who needed Sondheim to correct his own heart condition. Rescuing Sondheim and defeating Cross, Lang was relieved when Sondheim was able to save the life of his daughter. Lang intended to return the Ant-Man costume to its owner and turn himself in, but Henry Pym offered to let him keep them, provided Lang put them to lawful use.{{r|Marvel Premiere #48}}

===Stark Industries===
[[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] recruited Scott to find out who [[Justin Hammer (Earth-616)|Justin Hammer]] really is.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 #125|126}} When [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Dr. Bruce Banner]] asked Iron Man to help him either be cured or killed. They design a nuclear-powered regulator that would allow him to control his heart beat preventing transformations into the Hulk. Scott Lang and Erica Sondheim successfully implant the device in Banner's chest. After exposing Banner to the emotional overlord inducement generator they are convinced that the regulator will keep the Hulk reigned in from now on.{{r|Iron Man #131}} However, this was not the case. Tony, Scott, and Sondheim restrained Banner's transformation, ending with Sondheim's use of sound waves to return Banner to normal.{{r|Iron Man #132}} Iron Man directs Sondheim to remove the regulator from the Hulk's chest before he wakes up. Unfortunately, Stark is dealing with his own health crisis, leading Scott to shrink into the Iron Man armor in order to save Tony's life.{{r|Iron Man #133}}

Scott also helped Yellowjacket rescue the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] who had been captured by [[Pernell Solomon (Earth-616)|Dr. Pernell Solomon]].{{r|Avengers #195}} Alongside the Avengers, he first battled [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 #196|197}}

===Fantastic Four===
He then met the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], and with them first journeyed to a "micro-world," and battled there alongside the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #87}} He encountered [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] and [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]], and then fought  [[Dire Wraith]]s alongside [[Rom (Earth-616)|Rom]] and [[Brandy Clark (Earth-616)|Brandy Clark]].{{r|Rom Vol 1 #58|59}}

He helped the Avengers in infiltrating Taskmaster's henchmen-training facility, battling the Taskmaster alongside [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], and visited Henry Pym while he was in prison.{{r|Iron Man #224}}

When the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] took control of the [[Avengers Mansion]] and captured some of the current team; Lang was instrumental in helping the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] defeat the [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]] and [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]], two villains much stronger and more powerful than them. The pair attacked a hospital in an attempt to kill a comatose [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] {{r|Avengers Vol 1 #275|277}}

===Shrunken Spider-Man===
At the Tomorrow Exposition, techno-thieves break in to steal the Quark machine. With the expo closed, Scott shrinks down as Ant-Man to take a private tour, but his gas apparently also works on Spidey who shrinks to insect size. As the thieves attack a guard, Spider-Man battles a spider. Ant-Man stops the thieves from stealing the Quark field generator's circuit board while Spidey destroys the attacking automatic insect eradicator. Ant-Man enlarges and escapes with the circuit board but is slowed by a magnesium flare. Spidey battles the robot guard dog while Ant-Man summons an army of ants to stop the thieves. Spidey stumbles across the fracas and helps, webbing the thieves up. As the police arrive, Ant-Man takes Spidey to a secluded spot to re-enlarge him, but fails. Spidey is stuck the way he is.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #24}} While still trapped in his shrunken size Spider-Man and Scott battled the [[Scarlet Beetle (Earth-616)|Scarlet Beetle]].{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #10}}

===Stane International===
When Stark International was bought out by [[Stane International (Earth-616)|Stane International]], Lang resigned out of respect to Tony Stark, the company's former head (and secretly Iron Man.) Lang opened his own electronics business. Later, he temporarily gave up the business to be hired by the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] when their scientist and leader [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] was missing for an extended period. Lang and Cassie lived at the [[Four Freedoms Plaza|Four's headquarters]] during this time.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 384}}

===Armor Wars===
When Tony Stark discovered that Justin Hammer had stolen his Iron Man technology and provided it to [[Clayton Wilson (Earth-616)|Force]] and other villains, Stark hired Lang to hack into the computers at [[Transcorp]] in order to find out to whom Hammer had sold or supplied that technology. Lang physically infiltrated the Transcorp computers as Ant-Man, and had to fend off an automated pest-control system before successfully transmitting the data to Stark.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 225}}

===Heroes for Hire===
During a time when many of Earth's heroes were believed dead after battling the psychic entity, [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], Lang agreed to join the newly-reformed superteam [[Heroes for Hire (Oracle Inc.) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]].{{r|Heroes for Hire #5}}

===The Avengers===
Lang continued to aid his superpowered colleagues as needed, such as joining other Avengers associates in infiltrating the base of the Avengers' enemies of the [[Triune Understanding (Earth-616)|Triune Understanding]], although this turned out to be a ruse by the Triunes to discredit the Avengers. He also helped the Avengers against the threat of the villain [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]], who nearly succeeded in conquering the world. After overthrowing Kang's would-be regime,{{citation}} the Avengers offered Lang a place on the roster, and he agreed.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 62}}

===Jessica Jones===
Scott dated [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]], the super-heroine named Jewel who left to become a private investigator.{{r|Alias #13|15}} He assisted her in a matter with [[Mattie Franklin]], one of the many female heroes to take the [[Spider-Woman]] identity. Assisting the duo is [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Clay Quartermain (Earth-616)|Clay Quartermain]].{{r|Alias #16|26}} Their relationship ended when she revealed that she was pregnant with [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]]'s baby.{{r|Alias #28}}

===Jack of Hearts===
Lang's place with the Avengers was not without its personal struggles. Scott was brought into court for a custody battle with his ex-wife over the safety of his daughter Cassie when she visited the [[Avengers Mansion]] headquarters of the team. Lang also struggled with his new teammate [[Jonathan Hart (Earth-616)|Jack of Hearts]], as the two often clashed over trifling matters. However, when Lang's daughter was randomly kidnapped by a madman, Jack of Hearts rescued Cassie at the risk of his own powers consuming him, which ultimately killed him.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 76}}

===Avengers: Disassembled===
Lang felt guilty that he had only begun to reconcile with his new friend. Later, Jack of Hearts somehow returned to the Mansion with a message of warning for the team. When Lang reached out to his friend, Jack of Hearts detonated himself, taking half of the Avengers Mansion and seemingly Scott Lang with him. This attack was later discovered to be motivated by the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], whose mind had become unhinged due to the magical powers she constantly felt forced to control. Whether this was truly the corpse of Jack of Hearts or just a magical construct of the Scarlet Witch remains unclear.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 500}}{{r|Marvel Zombies Supreme #4}}

===Stature===
Cassie subsequently becomes Stature as a member of the [[Young Avengers]], having apparently taken enough [[Pym Particles]] over the years to enable her to automatically grow and shrink in size whenever she wants.{{r|Young Avengers #2}} [[Ant-Man's Helmet]] fell into [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus Cho]]'s possession for a time. He wore it with Cassie's blessing, choosing to focus on the insect mind-controlling abilities.{{r|Mighty Avengers #25}}

===Children's Crusade===
[[File:Scott Lang (Earth-616), Cassandra Lang (Earth-616), and Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311) from Avengers The Children's Crusade Vol 1 9 001.jpg|thumb]]
A few years later, the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] traveled back in time with an amnesiac Scarlet Witch to the moments before Avengers Mansion was destroyed and escaped along with Lang, leaving the Avengers of that time to believe he had perished.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade Vol 1 #5|7}} This celebration was short lived however, after Lang witnessed the death of his daughter Stature in battle with [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]].{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade Vol 1 #8|9}} Lang then swore vengeance on Doom.{{r|Marvel NOW! Point One Vol 1 1}}

[[File:FF Vol 2 16 Textless.jpg|left|thumb]]
===Future Foundation===
The [[Future Foundation (Earth-616)|Future Foundation]] would soon be left in the hands of Scott, after Reed discovered that the cosmic energy that gave him is powers was decaying, forcing him and the rest of the Fantastic Four to visit another universe in order to fix the problem. Scott was left with [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]], [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]], and Johnny Storm's current girlfriend, [[Darla Deering (Earth-616)|Darla Deering]], to be the replacement Fantastic Four for what was supposed to only be approximately four minutes, unless something went wrong, which of course it did.{{r|FF Vol 2 #1}} He later defeated Doctor Doom, and when the Fantastic Four returned, he left the team.{{r|FF Vol 2 #16}}

===Original Sin===
Following the murder of [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu]] the [[Watcher]], Scott was chosen alongside [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]], [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]],  [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]], the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]], and Doctor Strange as one of the potential candidates to replace the original [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] in his role as the defender of [[Earth]].{{r|Original Sin #1|3}} He and the others attempted to stop Fury after he was revealed to be the Watcher's true murderer.{{r|Original Sin #4|8}}

===Ant-Man Security Solutions===
As a consequence of a magic spell gone wrong, Doctor Doom's moral compass was temporarily inverted. In an attempt to atone for killing Cassie, he chaneled the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]'s powers and used them to resurrect Scott's daughter. She turned out alive and well on Scott's doorstep.{{r|Avengers World #16}} With Cassie returned, Scott tried to adjust his life, and got the job of Head of Security at [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]]. However, after Cassie moved with her mother Peggy to Miami, Scott ditched his new job in favor of spending more time with his daughter (against Peggy's will and without her knowledge).{{r|Ant-Man Vol 1 1}} As part of his new life, Scott opened a business called [[Ant-Man Security Solutions (Earth-616)|Ant-Man Security Solutions]]. Scott battled [[Maxwell Markham (Earth-616)|Grizzly]] who wanted revenge on Ant-Man due to his betrayal during the [[Siege (Event)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]], unaware he was not [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Eric O'Grady]]. After the misunderstanding was cleared, Lang offered Grizzly a place at his new company.{{r|Ant-Man Vol 1 2}}

[[File:Scott Lang (Earth-616) from Ant-Man Vol 1 2 0001.png|thumb|Ant-Man Security Solutions]]
Trouble followed Scott and his family after Cassie was abducted by [[Cross Technological Enterprises (Earth-616)|Cross Technological Enterprises]].{{r|Ant-Man Vol 1 3}} With the help of Grizzly's friend from [[Villains Anonymous (Earth-616)|Villains Anonymous]], the [[Samuel Saxon (Earth-616)|Machinesmith]], Ant-Man infiltrated Cross Technologies and fought his way to [[Darren Cross (Earth-616)|Darren Cross]], whom [[Erica Sondheim (Earth-616)|Dr. Sondheim]] was blackmailed into reviving using Cassie's heart.{{r|Ant-Man Vol 1 4}} Darren engaged in combat against Ant-Man while the hero tried to buy time for Sondheim to transplant another heart into Cassie.{{r|Ant-Man Vol 1 5}}

After Cross was forced to flee when the Pym Particles now in his body caused him to shrink down, Scott shrunk down to microscopic size, and was guided by Sondheim to attack Cassie's white cells and allow her body to accept the new heart's tissue. Even though the procedure was difficult, Scott was finally able to help Cassie survive the experience. When Peggy and Blake arrived, Sondheim told her that Cassie had suffered an infraction and Scott took Cassie to her, which they believed. Although he saved his daughter, Scott decided to distance himself from her so that she could have a normal life.{{r|Ant-Man Vol 1 5}}

Scott couldn't resist the urge to accompany her daughter, and started stalking her while in miniature size,{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 1}} something that enraged Cassie after Scott confessed his behavior, and led her to resent her father even more than when she simply believed he had distanced from her.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 4}} Cassie's increasing frustration prompted her to enlist in a mobile app developed by the [[Power Broker (Power Broker, Inc.) (Earth-616)|Power Broker]] called [[Hench]] that facilitated anybody a supervillain career, with the intention to shut it down from the inside. However, Power Broker's revelation of the truth behind Cassie's latest health problem ensured her collaboration in infiltrating Cross Technologies as [[Stinger]], in order to shut down Cross' own app, a copy and rival of Hench called Lackey.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 6}}

[[File:Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
Once he learned of Cassie's whereabouts, Ant-Man assembled a group of supervillains, including his casual romantic partner the [[Janice Lincoln (Earth-616)|Beetle]], to break into Cross Technological to prevent her from falling into Cross' clutches.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 7}} The rescue mission was successful, but the police were alerted of the intrusion.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 10}} In order to protect Cassie, Scott took the blame for the situation and was arrested.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 11}}

Scott faced court, and he was represented by She-Hulk.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 11}} However, the prosecutor was Janice Lincoln, the civilian identity Beetle,{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 12}} who held a grudge against Scott for having failed to use their sporadic relationship to gain access to Pym Particles. Lincoln managed to put Scott in a tight spot by using her knowledge on Scott's break in plan and manipulating every witness account to her favor. The trial was interrupted by the appearance of Darren Cross, now donning a stolen [[Yellowjacket's Suit|Yellowjacket Armor]], who wanted to have revenge on Ant-Man for the injuries his son [[Augustine Cross (Earth-616)|Augustine]] sustained during Scott's mission to rescue Cassie from them. Even though Scott and his allies fell to Yellowjacket's power, Stinger managed to defeat him by forcing him to ingest the Pym Particle-neutralizing pills that Scott had been taken while incarcerated. The trial resumed, and the surprising testimony of Peggy Rae turned the tide in Scott's favor, allowing him to walk away as a free man. Even though Scott's business was shut down, having forged a new relationship with both Cassie and Peggy allowed him to begin a new lease on life, with his daughter joining him in his adventures, together as Ant-Man and Stinger.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 13}}

===[[Secret Empire (Event)|Secret Empire]]===
When [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] took over the United States under the leadership of an alternate-timeline version of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America]],{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} Scott forced Cassie to take refuge in France{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 2}} while he joined the American resistance group known as the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} Unfortunately, Hydra's forces got hold of Cassie, and used her as leverage to force Scott to become a mole.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 6}}

After joining [[Anthony Stark (Third A.I.) (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]'s efforts to recover the pieces of the [[Cosmic Cube]] that was used to shift Captain America's allegiance in order to bring him back to normal,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 3|5}}{{r|Secret Empire: Underground Vol 1 1}} Ant-Man tipped off Hydra when the heroes returned from their journey with two shards, resulting in Hydra launching an attack against the Underground's base in [[Mount|The Mount]]. Scott immediately came clean, being ridden of guilt despite his best interests being Cassie's safety.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 6}} Ant-Man would later redeem himself, playing a key role in the defeat of the evil Captain America by using Pym Particles to help the [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]] reach into the rebuilt [[Cosmic Cube]] in the hands of Hydra at the subatomic level.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}}

Still ashamed by his actions during Hydra's empire, Ant-Man stowed away on the ship of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] while the intergalactic heroes were visiting Earth in hopes to leave the planet with them. The Guardians found him out, but welcomed him on board.{{r|All-New Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 12}}

<!-- ===Trapped in the Microverse===
For Cassie's birthday, Scott planned to return home to celebrate. He contacted [[Nadia Pym (Earth-616)|Nadia Pym]] to teleport him back to earth. Nadia initially refused in doing so, mad at Scott for stealing the ant-man costume from her father. But Scott convinced her into doing so. At the last minute, when the teleporter was ready, Scott forgot gift for Cassie and grabbed it. Nadia had to get him and shrunk both of them beyond molecules. They got stuck in the [[Microverse]].{{r|Ant-Man and the Wasp Vol 1 1}} -->

| Powers                  = '''[[Pym Particles]]:''' Ant-Man carried a supply of Pym Particles in his belt, allowing him to reduce himself to the size of an ant, approximately one-half inch in height, by means of a rare group of sub-atomic particles, the source of which is as yet unknown, which he is able to contain in magnetic-field "canisters" (the shape of the magnetic lines of force were made visible by the confined particles, whose concentration caused them to behave like a gas).{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 1}}
* These particles, whose wavelength is in the mental range when released, allow Ant-Man to will himself and other objects to reduce in size or enlarge. The mechanics involved having most of the mass of the nucleus of each affected atom convert into energetic particles which take up orbit around the nucleus - thus, although gravitation do not affect these particles, the mass of the original volume remains intact.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1}}
* This means a punch delivered by the half-inch high Ant-Man would feel like the blow of a normal-sized man.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 1}} Ant-Man's reducing particle has no time limit to its potency.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1}}
| Abilities               = '''Electrical Engineer:''' Scott has a masters degree in electrical engineering.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1}}

| Strength                = Scott possessed the normal human strength of a man of his age, height, and build who engaged in moderate regular exercise. At small size, his strength is equal to an ant's.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1}} As Myrmidon, he possessed superhuman strength (at least Class 10, strong enough to incapacitate the Thing with one blow) and durability as well as extendable blades on his wrists.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 1}}

| Equipment               = '''[[Ant-Man's Suit]]:''' {{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1}}
* '''[[Ant-Man's Helmet]]:''' Ant-Man also wore a cybernetic helmet designed by Henry Pym permitting him rudimentary communication and control of insects, allowing him to lead hundreds of ants to overwhelm any single opponent.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 1}} He could broadcast to a range of about one mile (1.6 km), depending on the materials surrounding him. His helmet also contained sound amplification equipment which also shifted the frequency of his voice so that he could be heard by normal-sized humans despite his diminutive size, as well as providing its own oxygen supply.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1}} 

When exposed to the "[[Horton Cells]]" while travelling Android [[Human Torch (Android) (Earth-616)|Human Torch]]'s body developed pyrokinetic powers. However the exposure was temporary.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 1 13}}

| Weapons                 = '''Ant-Man's Wrist Gauntlets''' Ant-Man's wrist gauntlets enabled him to fire bio-electric blasts of adjustable force. His original helmet was able to fire 'disruptor' blasts of concussive force that Lang said were less powerful than the stings of [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|The Wasp]].{{r|Iron Man #131}}

| Notes                   = * Wanting to devote more time to his daughter, Ant-Man turned down membership offers from both the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], though he eventually accepted Avengers membership.
* Ant-Man's costume for ''[[Ant-Man Vol 1|Ant-Man]]'' was designed by [[Chris Samnee]].{{r|[http://chrissamnee.tumblr.com/post/99826618705/cover-by-myself-and-matt-wilson-to-the-just Chris Samnee - Tumblr]}}
* Scott's early appearances are reprinted in various comics.{{r|Marvel Team-Up (UK) #16}}
