===Early Life===
Morris Bench was born and raised in the [[Bronx]], [[New York (State)|New York]]. He began working as a crewman on a cargo ship.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 11}}

===Accident===
He was accidentally knocked overboard by [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] while a powerful experimental generator was being lowered into the ocean for testing. Exposed to the energy conversion process of the generator while being bombarded with volcanic gases, Bench's cellular structure was altered. When he was rescued from the depths, his body began exuding great quantities of a watery substance, which Bench first thought was perspiration. Annoyed by the incessant dripping, Bench went to a local pub to stir up trouble. Finding none, he was astonished to learn that he could convert his entire physical form into a watery liquid.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 212}}

===Becoming Hydro-Man===
Soon after discovering his powers, Hydro-Man set out to find those he held responsible for his condition in order to make them pay. He eventually encountered Spider-Man, and on their second altercation, was defeated when Spider-Man managed to splatter the nucleus of his body sufficiently far enough apart that Hydro-Man could not reform himself before evaporating.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 212}}

===Mud Creature===
A few weeks later, Hydro-Man reintegrated his form in a water tower on a [[Manhattan]] rooftop where apparently the majority of his body particles had fallen as rain. Returning to his favorite pub, he was chagrined to find William Baker, alias the [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]], romancing his sometime-girlfriend [[Sadie Frickett (Earth-616)|Sadie Frickett]]. The two criminals soon began fighting over her until Spider-Man came along to try to stop them. Turning their attentions to him, the two joined forces against their mutual foe. Spider-Man, however, tricked the two into running into each other, each in his altered particulate state. Collapsing into the harbor, the two soon emerged from the brine as a composite sand-water creature containing both of their substances but neither of their full intelligence. Dimly recalling their desire for Sadie Frickett, the mud-being sought her out at her apartment. After getting over her initial shock, Frickett decided to exploit the creature's devotion to her and through a theatrical agent, arranged for a special exhibition of the mud-thing. The creature inevitably went berserk but was stopped when a special gas sprayed from police helicopters dehydrated it and caused it to crumble. The soggy sand was scooped up by the authorities and taken to a police laboratory where researchers tried to restore the men to life by various stimuli, including chemicals and radiation. Believing the task was hopeless, the police dumped the canister containing them. A short time later, Hydro-Man and Sandman managed to integrate themselves into their separate rightful forms. Wanting no more of each other's company after their humiliating ordeal, the two went their separate ways, with Hydro-Man heading out of town.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 217}}

===Sinister Syndicate===
He was recruited into the [[Sinister Syndicate (Earth-616)|Sinister Syndicate]] along with the [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|Beetle]], [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]], [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]], and [[James Sanders (Earth-616)|Speed Demon]]. At [[Coney Island]], Spider-Man and [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]], who were working together to catch [[Jason Macendale Jr. (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern]], battled the villains and only managed to defeat them with the help of Sandman.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 #280|281}}

Hydro-Man battled Spidey at a construction site, but was forced to flee when Spider-Man combined him with cement.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 315}}

===Frightful Four===

When the Fantastic Four tracked their evil counterparts to their hideout, they fell right into the Wizard's trap. The Wizard had discovered that [[Aron (Earth-616)|Aron the Rogue Watcher]] was observing the Fantastic Four. Aron incapacitated the Fantastic Four and arrived with his minion the [[Draconus (Earth-616)|Dragon Man]].{{r|Fantastic Four #327}} However, Aron was only interested in collecting the Fantastic Four's DNA samples and quickly teleported away. With the Four defeated, the Wizard and his minions placed them in cryogenic suspension tubes. However they were located by [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Ben Grimm]], who freed his comrades and they quickly defeated the Frightful Four.{{r|Fantastic Four #328|336}}

===Assembly of Evil===
Some time later, Hydro-Man joined the [[Assembly of Evil (Earth-616)|Assembly of Evil]]. The Assembly confronted a small contingent of [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] who were holding a press conference regarding the "[[Acts of Vengeance (Event)|Acts of Vengeance]]."{{r|Mutant Misadventures of Cloak and Dagger Vol 1 8}} The Avengers defeated the Assembly with the help of [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] and [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]], who had only agreed to join the villains so they could foil their plans. The Assembly was remanded to custody and the various members have never since banded together again.{{r|Mutant Misadventures of Cloak and Dagger Vol 1 9}}

He was easily defeated by the [[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]] enhanced Spider-Man.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 160}}

[[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] was asked by Lester Cromwell to test his security system at his estate. However Hydro-Man was hidden inside the swimming pool. He followed her into the building disguised as a puddle. He then attacked her with a blast of water. She used a medieval tapestry like a towel to soak up Hydro-Man. She put the tapestry inside an airtight and bulletproof case where he was trapped.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 8}}

The Sinister Syndicate was confronted by the [[Wild Pack (Earth-616)|Wild Pack]], led by Silver Sable.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #17|18}}

===A.I.M. Weapons Expo===
Hydro-Man was among the many criminals to visit the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] Weapons Expo on [[Boca Caliente]], but the event was however crashed by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Captain America #411|412}}

Under unknown circumstances, Hydro-Man was sent to the [[Vault]], but he managed to escape from there alongside many other villains.{{r|Venom: Deathtrap: The Vault Vol 1 1}}

===Masters of Evil===
Hydro-Man was one of many super-criminals employed by corrupt billionaire [[Justin Hammer (Earth-616)|Justin Hammer]] for a time, and later served in the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]], assembled by Hammer's daughter [[Justine Hammer (Earth-616)|Justine]], alias the [[Crimson Cowl]].{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 64}} However, after Justine's arrest and the apparent death of Justin, [[Hammer Industries (Earth-616)|Hammer Industries]] phased out its criminal enterprises and Bench, along with fellow employee the [[Herman Schultz (Earth-616)|Shocker]], was laid off.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 67|69}}

The Shocker and Hydro-Man then teamed-up for one last crime, seeking enough money to retire, but Hydro-Man's thirst for revenge against Spider-Man led to their defeat.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 51|53}}

[[File:Morris Bench (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Spider-Man 2005 Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Enhanced Hydro-Man]]
===Return to the Frightful Four===
The Wizard also re-recruited Hydro-Man onto his team after he was defeated in a battle against Spider-Man and the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]]. Hydro-Man had his powers boosted by the Wizard, but was also made dependent of him to live.{{r|Fantastic Four #512|514}} During a battle against the Fantastic Four, Hydro-Man, [[Salamandra (Earth-616)|Salamandra]], the Wizard and [[Cole Wittman (Earth-616)|Cole]] seemingly perished when Cole increased her mass to a massive level, causing them to slam into the waters outside of [[New York City]].{{r|Fantastic Four #516}}

===Raft===
He was one of the 46 villains to escape [[Raft]] when [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]]  was broken out by [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]]. He attempted to drown the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 2}}

===Puppet Master & Mad Thinker===
Hydro-Man was among a group of super-villains who were gathered by the [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]] and the [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]], who were attempting to gather an army of villains to battle the Fantastic Four. This was a failed endeavor as none of the gathered villains wished to participate and left, unknowingly leaving the DNA samples that the two organizers of this plan really sought. These DNA samples ended up in the hands of the Fantastic Four who came to believe that they would die within two years unless they permanently incarcerated their foes.{{r|Fantastic Four: Foes #1}} Hydro-Man was among those captured and placed in [[Prison 42|a new Vault prison]] built in the [[Negative Zone]].{{r|Fantastic Four: Foes #5}} When the Mad Thinker staged a massive breakout, they were opposed by the Fantastic Four, [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] and [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]].{{r|Fantastic Four: Foes #6}}

===Sinister Twelve===
Hydro-Man later joined the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]]'s [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]], but was defeated and the team disbanded by Spider-Man.{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man Vol 1 6|11}}

After the Civil War, Hydro-Man worked with Shocker and [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]] to try to rob Bailey's Auction House, but was stopped by Spidey. However they escaped when [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] and [[Melati Kusuma (Earth-616)|Komodo]] arrived to arrest Spider-Man regarding the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. They were later tracked down by the [[Scarlet Spiders (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spiders]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 3}}

===Frightful Four===
He rejoined the Frightful Four when they went up against the FF, led by the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and his wife [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]].{{r|Fantastic Four #547}} The two teams battled, however, the Wizard had a surprise of his own: a fifth member he had hidden, Klaw.{{r|Fantastic Four #548}} The Frightful Four's secret weapon was defeated by the Thing thanks to some [[Vibranium]] earplugs that made him immune to Klaw's powers. Hydro-Man and the rest of the group were then easily defeated.{{r|Fantastic Four #549}}

===Dying Wish===
Hydro-Man was one of the many villains who got a message from Doctor Octopus (in reality Spider-Man whose mind was swapped with that of [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] by a special [[Octobot]], leaving him to die in the Doc's decaying body) to get him out from the Raft, but was one of the only three who took the job, the others being the [[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Trapster]] and [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Scorpion]]. After they successfully broke him out of the Raft, they took him to one of Doc Ock's many secret hideouts, where Peter planned a way to return to his body with the villains' help. During the final confrontation between the body-swapped Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus, Hydro-Man found all of Peter Parker's colleagues hidden in a room and tried to drown them, but the [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon gang]] siphoned his water body into a tank and contained his "soul molecule."{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 699|700}}

===Dirty Job===
[[File:Morris Bench (Earth-616) from Spider-Man Deadpool Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|right]]

However, Hydro-Man was confronted by Spider-Man and almost had his plan foiled by him, if not by [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], who dragged Spider-Man away. After absorbing the wastewater, Hydro-Man went back to the city and crossed paths with Spider-Man and Deadpool again. This time, however, Spider-Man threw Deadpool inside Hydro-Man and detonated Deadpool's grenades, blowing his plan to bits.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool #1}}

===Oasis Spring Water===
[[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and an alternate version of [[Red Wolf (Earth-51920)|Red Wolf]] later encountered Hydro-Man who was working for a group called [[Oasis Spring Water (Earth-616)|Oasis Spring Water]], which was illegally draining the water supply of the [[Sweet Medicine Indian Reservation]].{{r|Occupy Avengers Vol 1 1}} Hydro-Man captured Hawkeye and Red Wolf, but the pair escaped and were aided by [[Silas Fireheart (Earth-616)|Silas]] and [[Frank Fireheart (Earth-616)|Frank Fireheart]]. Silas knocked out Hydro-Man by electrocuting him.{{r|Occupy Avengers Vol 1 2}}

===Invaders===
Hydro-Man became a prisoner of Atlantis and was under the control of [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]], who somehow managed to take his hydrokinesis powers for himself.{{r|Invaders Vol 3 2}} He was later freed by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]].{{r|Invaders Vol 3 10}}

===Boomerang Revenge Squad===
At some point Hydro-Man regained his hydrokinesis powers and joined the [[Boomerang Revenge Squad (Earth-616)|Boomerang Revenge Squad]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 61}}

| Powers                  = 
'''Transformation - Water:''' Hydro-Man possesses the ability to bodily transform himself, in whole or in part, into a watery liquid substance of unknown composition. While in this state, his consciousness can control every droplet that comprises his body. Thus, he can will himself to turn liquid whenever struck. (Presumably, if he were to will just his torso to turn liquid, his still solid head and arms would fall to the ground. It is not known if this would cause injury to his solid parts or not. Hydro-Man can also propel the liquid particles of his body at great pressure in the same style as water shooting through a fire hose. It is not known how he generates the pressure to create this effect. Also, he can harden his fist as if it were ice hard.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 6}}
* Apparently Hydro-Man's liquid particles each possess some form of attraction for one another so that his disintegrated consciousness can draw all of the particles back into cohesion after total dispersal. It is not known if there is a limit to the particles' ability to attract one another. Nor is it known if there is a limit to how long Hydro-Man can remain in a completely aqueous state. Although he can merge with ordinary water, or use if to increase his mass, he does not gain mental control over this liquid as he does his own. Apparently, he has no difficulty reforming his solid physical state, even while fully immersed in water.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12}}
* Hydro-Man consciousness either resides in each of the billions of droplets that his body becomes, or exists in an intangible perhaps gas-like state. Since Hydro-Man can convert his entire head into water, and his brain is still capable of rational motivated thought, his brain can no longer be organic. It is probably that even in its solid state when it appears to be made of flesh, tissue, and bone; the Hydro-Man's body is no longer truly organic, it is not known if the Hydro-Man needs to eat, sleep, or eliminate waste products anymore.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 6}}
* Recent alterations of his powers by the Wizard have given him a finer degree of control over his own fluid form.{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia Vol 1 Fantastic Four}}

| Abilities               =
| Strength                = Hydro-Man possesses slightly superhuman strength, due to the process that gave him his powers. He can lift (press) about 550 pounds under optimal conditions.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man 2005 Vol 1 1}} Though the larger he expands by himself or with another body of water his strength increases.{{r|Heroic Age: Villains Vol 1 1}}
| Weaknesses              = '''[[Glossary:Soul Molecule|Soul Molecule]]:''' When Morris transforms into water, one molecule in his body contains his mind and tells the other molecules what to do. If this molecule is separated, the rest of his body becomes ordinary water.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 3 3}}{{r|New Avengers Most Wanted Files Vol 1 1}}

Hydro-Man can be easily defeated by being turned into ice and kept at the right temperature, such as when Spider-Man used an [[Spider-Tracer|Ice Pellet]] to take him out effortlessly.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #666}} Being made of water, he can also be defeated through electrocution.{{r|Occupy Avengers #2}}
