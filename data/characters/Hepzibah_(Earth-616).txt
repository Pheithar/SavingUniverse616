[[File:Hepzibah (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 484 001.jpg|thumb|left|Hepzibah dancing in {{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 484}}]]
Hepzibah was born on the planet [[Tryl'sart]], while under [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]] [[Shi'ar Empire|Imperial]] Rule. She had also spent some time in the prison on the planet Alsibar, where she met [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|Corsair]] for the first time. While Corsair was imprisoned by the authority of the then Shi'ar Emperor [[D'ken Neramani (Earth-616)|D'Ken]], brother of [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]] and [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Lilandra]] of the Royal House of Neramani, Hepzibah, with the help of several other prisoners who would later form the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]] ([[Raza|Raza Longknife]], and [[Ch'od]]), aided Corsair in their mutual escape from Shi'ar prison. Corsair won the respect of the trio (becoming their leader) and eventually the heart of Hepzibah, becoming her lover.{{r|Classic X-Men #16}}

Hepzibah and the Starjammers teamed up with [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] on multiple occasions.{{r|X-Men #107}} In one such occurrence, Hepzibah and the Starjammers helped the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] neutralize the threat of [[Magus (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Magus]].{{r|New Mutants #50}} Hepzibah also aided the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] in rescuing some of the Hulk's people from the alien forces of Troyjan. The [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] personally saved her life.{{r|Incredible Hulk #415|416}}

Recently, after Corsair reunited with his son [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] and the Starjammers participated in a conflict between Lilandra's and D'Ken's forces, Corsair was killed by his own son [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]]. Hepzibah raided the X-Men's stolen Shi'ar ship's weapons locker and was ready to take vengeance on Vulcan. However, she was forced to return with the re-powered [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Xavier]], [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]], [[Armando Mu√±oz (Earth-616)|Darwin]], and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] when Lilandra, hoping to save her beloved Xavier from death and protect some of the X-Men (believing that the battle was not going well) locked the ship into a jump course for [[Earth]]. Consequently, Hepzibah, separated from her fellow Starjammers, was forced to reside with the X-Men on Earth with no way to return to Shi'ar space to help the Starjammers and Lilandra continue to fight Vulcan.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #484|486}}

Since she was stuck on Earth and had nowhere else to go, Hepzibah joined Professor X's team of X-Men. She and Warpath created a bond of sorts, with Hepzibah remarking that his presence helped her through her mourning for Corsair. She was seen in an altered standard [[X-Uniforms|X-Uniform]] entering the Morlock Tunnels alongside Warpath, [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], and [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #488}}

Hepzibah was one of the X-Men who answered the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] call for help when the Hulk attacked Professor Xavier. She flew the [[X-Men Blackbird|Blackbird]] on a collision course towards the Hulk, though without any effect.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #3}}

When [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] ordered Wolverine to assemble a new [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]], Hepzibah joined the team for a time.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 493}} Whiel searching for the first mutant child born since M-Day, they battled the Reavers.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 45}} Later, on Muir Island, she helped battle [[Predator X]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 207}} Together with the X-Men, she moved to [[San Francisco]] and then to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy Annual #1}}

She was threatened with deportation from the Earth by [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]]'s order,{{r|S.W.O.R.D. #2}} but after [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Gyrich]] was deprived of his director's post, his orders were canceled, and Hepzibah along with others aliens were allowed to stay on Earth.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. #5}}

Hepzibah eventually reunited with a resurrected Corsair and returned to space with the Starjammers.{{r|All-New X-Men #23}}

* Corsair could not pronounce her real name and named her Hepzibah.{{r|X-Men #107}} Hepzibah means "my delight is in her" in Hebrew. She was a queen and the mother of Manasseh in the Old Testament. However, Corsair was probably thinking of Walt Kelly's ''Pogo'' comic strip, in which Mam'selle Hepzibah was a sultry female skunk with a heavy French accent.
