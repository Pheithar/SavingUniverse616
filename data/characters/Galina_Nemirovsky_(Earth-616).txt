'''Galina Nemirovskaya''' (Russian: '''Галина Немировска''') is a top graduate of the Federal Dynamo program. Served briefly as the Crimson Dynamo before getting fired for insubordination. Out of a sense of revenge, she salvaged the remains of the Citadel and took over the identity of the Ultra-Dynamo.{{Citation}}

Nemirovsky was employed by [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]], who gave her a new Crimson Dynamo armor, as part of his planned vengeance on his old nemesis [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]. During this time she worked alongside numerous other foes of Iron Man.{{Citation}}
