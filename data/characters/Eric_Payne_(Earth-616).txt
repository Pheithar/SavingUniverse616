===Origin and early life===
Eric Simon Payne was a former [[United States Marine Corps (Earth-616)|U.S. Marine]] and later soldier of fortune and one time member of a [[Demons|demon]] cult who turned on the cult after obtaining the mystical [[Shadow Cloaks|Shadow Cloak]] and unlocking his own latent psychic abilities.{{citation}}

Payne has served in the [[Vietnam War]], he has served the mob, and he used to serve the [[Agents of Fortune (Earth-616)|Cult of Harvester of Eyes]]. Each time his service was rewarded with betrayal. He was sick of secret motives and unquestioned obedience.{{citation}}

===The Defenders===
He had already lost his wife, his innocence, and his idealism, before meeting with the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]].{{citation}} He hooked up with them while battling [[Vera Gemini (Earth-616)|Vera Gemini]]{{r|Defenders #59}} and eventually joined their ranks on a full time basis during their war with the [[Six-Fingered Hand (Earth-616)|Six-Fingered Hand]].{{citation}}

Eric was, however, plagued by mental instability and guilt over his past actions and, after turning himself in for crimes committed during his time as a mercenary, eventually ended up in an asylum. He discovered a shard of the [[Nexus of All Realities]] and briefly became involved with the [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]] and with the woman named [[Sorrow (Earth-616)|Sorrow]] (who became his partner and lover for a time).{{citation}}

===The Initiative===
After the [[Civil War]], he was listed by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] as a potential recruit for the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]],{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report #1}} and was willing to join a new team of [[Defenders (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Defenders]] headed by [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]]. However, when Nighthawk suggested it to Initiative boss Tony Stark, Stark declined the offer. Instead, Eric became a member of the [[Hawaii (State)|Hawaii]]an Initiative team, the [[Point Men (Earth-616)|Point Men]], serving the team as their "Monster Hunter."{{citation}}

During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], when the [[Delroy Garrett Jr. (Earth-616)|new 3-D Man]] arrived in Hawaii, Devil-Slayer informed him that he had sensed portents of doom all day. When 3-D Man identified team member Magnitude as a Skrull impostor, the Skrull attacked and severely wounded the other Point Men, Star Sign and Paydirt. The Skrull was killed, and Devil-Slayer used his Shadow Cloak to teleport Delroy to [[Camp Hammond]] before taking Star Sign and Paydirt to a hospital. Devil-Slayer later appeared in [[Utah (State)|Utah]] with the cyborg [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]] to aid 3-D Man and the [[Skrull Kill Krew (Earth-616)|Skrull Kill Krew]].{{citation}}

===The Revengers===
He joined [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]]'s [[Revengers (Earth-616)|Revengers]] and successfully attacked the [[Avengers Mansion]].{{r|New Avengers Annual Vol 2 1}} He was later in the day defeated by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] combined forces, and while being interrogated, explain his participation by claiming that he had seen countless realities, and the wish of being among the winners in a world without Avengers.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 3 1}}
