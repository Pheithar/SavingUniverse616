| History                 = As a young man, Jefferson Davis lived with his brother [[Aaron Davis (Earth-1610)|Aaron Davis]] in [[Brooklyn]]. Aaron was constantly involved in illegal activities, which Jefferson despised. One night, Jefferson accompanied his brother to meet [[Turk Barrett (Earth-1610)|Turk Barrett]]. Jefferson was forced to fight Turk's henchmen and was arrested when the police raided Turk's hideout, even though he had managed to overpower Turk's men. His bail was paid by [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-1610)|Nick Fury]], the director of [[Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate (Earth-1610)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who was impressed by reports of Jefferson's fighting skills. Knowing that Turk would be impressed too, Fury told Davis to accept whatever job Turk offered him, so he could be Fury's eye on the underworld.

Jefferson worked as Turk's muscle, making Turk a feared man in the city, until [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-1610)|Wilson Fisk]], a wannabe kingpin on the rise, offered Turk a large sum of money to leave the city.{{r|Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man Vol 1 8}} Jefferson joined Fisk's [[Enforcers (Earth-1610)|Enforcers]] and reluctantly continued his illegal activities since Fury still requested his services.

During physical therapy, he met [[Rio Morales (Earth-1610)|Rio Morales]], with whom he had years later his son [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Miles]].{{r|Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man Vol 1 9}} Jefferson despised Aaron for having stuck with his old, criminal ways, even prohibiting Miles from interacting with his uncle. Jefferson was now a man with sensible morals who strived to teach Miles the differences between right and wrong and lead him down the correct path in life, going so far as to join the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-1610)|NYPD]].

Jefferson and Rio were present at the lottery drawing for Miles' chance to enter the prestigious [[Brooklyn Visions Academy]], and they were pleased when they discovered their son had been accepted as one of its attendees.{{r|Ultimate Comics Spider-Man Vol 2 1}} Later while searching for Miles, he burst into his brother [[Aaron Davis (Earth-1610)|Aaron]]'s home, which resulted in a dispute between the two siblings.
