===Early Life===
Jane Foster's mother died of cancer when she was nine years old.{{r|Unworthy Thor #4}} Following this tragedy, her father, a plumber, worked two jobs in order for her to go through medical school, exhausting himself. Nevertheless, he managed to give Jane a good childhood, never missing a softball game, forgetting a birthday or failing to encourage her in any thing she could set her mind to.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 2}} However, Jane's father later died from complications from a heart attack.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 2 704}}

===Meeting Thor===
She became a nurse hired by [[Donald Blake (Earth-616)|Dr. Donald Blake]] to assist him in his private medical practice. Actually, the crippled Dr. Donald Blake was the [[Homo sapiens|human]] identity used for many years by the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] god, [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]. Jane and Blake traveled to [[San Diablo]] during a civil war between a communist faction and a democratic faction. Because of the fighting, there was a shortage of medical help in San Diablo, and several American doctors interceded. They battled the [[Santiago Rivera (Earth-616)|Executioner]] who tried to destroy the medical supplies. Thor was able to stop him and they helped the people of San Diablo.{{r|Journey into Mystery #84}} Blake fell deeply in love with Foster, who was unaware of his dual-identity. She was infatuated with Thor, whom she had not yet met in his godly identity, but took a protective attitude toward him, worrying about his health and frailty.{{r|Journey into Mystery #85}} She would regularly gush over Thor's exploits, much to Blake's annoyance,{{r|Journey into Mystery #86}} causing him to wonder if Jane would ever love a normal man like him.{{r|Journey into Mystery #87}}

[[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]], taking on the guise of an old man, entered Donald Blake's doctors office and hypnotized Jane and gave her secret commands. He then entered Donald's office, and when Don reported for work, he found Loki waiting for him and changed into Thor. Loki challenged the Thunder God to a contest in [[Central Park]], a challenge that Thor accepted before Loki left. Changing back into Donald Blake he told Jane that he was leaving for the afternoon, unaware that Jane was about to enact Loki's hypnotic suggestions upon his departure. At Central Park, as Thor battled Loki, he was unaware that Jane was still under Loki's thrall and wandering in the area. Loki then transformed a tree into a tiger which he set upon Jane, and turned the Thunder God's attention to Jane's situation. Thor had two options: grab his returning hammer, [[Mjolnir]], or save Jane. With no choice, Thor chose the latter, and after dealing with the mystical tiger, he reverted back into Blake. When Blake attempted to recover his weapon, Loki put a magical force field around it, preventing Blake from changing back into Thor. With his enemy apparently defeated, Loki transformed into a bird and flew away, planning to conquer the [[Earth]]. Blake revived Jane and took her back home; meanwhile Loki used his magic to terrorize the people of [[New York City]]. Jane later witnessed Thor's return and the defeat of Loki.{{r|Journey into Mystery #88}}

[[File:Jane Foster (Earth-616) and Thor Odinson (Earth-616) from Journey into Mystery Vol 1 87 001.jpg|left|thumb]]
Jane and Donald were kidnapped by [[Andrew Thatcher (Earth-616)|Thug Thatcher]], but Blake escaped and became Thor.{{r|Journey into Mystery #89}} Blake contemplated revealing his true identity as Thor to Jane in the hopes of winning her love. However, right when he was about to tell her, Odin contacted Thor telepathically and warned him against doing so.{{r|Journey into Mystery #90|91}} One normal day as Jane left Dr. Blake's office for an errand, she passed a wounded jewel thief and his two partners. They entered Blake's office and demanded treatment. Distracting them, Blake tapped his cane and transformed into Thor. Strapping the criminals to an operating table with surgical tape, he attached it to his magic hammer and "threw" the criminals to the police station. Dr. Blake prepared to use a rubber hammer on a patient's knee. As Jane assured the patient Dr. Blake was skilled with using a mallet, Blake thought to himself that she does not know the half of it.{{r|Journey into Mystery #92}}

Although Foster was strongly attracted to Dr. Blake, she left his medical practice and began working for a Doctor [[Basil Andrews (Earth-616)|Bruce Andrews]] when Blake did not try and rescue her during the [[Molto (Earth-616)|Lava Man]]'s attack on the city.{{r|Journey into Mystery #97}} However, she later returned after the [[Klaus Voorhees (Earth-616)|Cobra]] attacked and Bruce submitted to him and she felt he was a coward.{{r|Journey into Mystery #98}}

Don Blake was next approached by discredited scientist Calvin Zabo for a job. When Blake refused to hire him, Zabo began experimenting on himself, creating a serum that transformed him into a monstrous form. Calling himself Mister Hyde, Zabo sought to revenge against Blake. Meanwhile, Thor continued to petition Odin to allow him to marry Jane Foster, to no avail. However Odin told Thor that should Jane prove herself to be brave, he would make her an immortal. When Mr. Hyde attacked Blake's office, Thor was there to stop him. In response, Hyde began committing robberies disguised as Thor.{{r|Journey into Mystery #99}}

Afterward, Blake decided to reveal his dual-identity to Foster, but his father, [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]], monarch of Asgard, appeared to him and forbade him to reveal this secret to any mortal. Even though Odin tried for a long time to quash the romance between the two, he ordered her life to be saved when she lay dying after an explosion caused by a battle between Thor and [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mister Hyde]] and [[Klaus Voorhees (Earth-616)|Cobra]].{{r|Journey into Mystery #111}}

Foster truly loved Blake, and one day she told him angrily that she would not wait forever for him to declare his love to her. Thor intended to marry Foster, but then Odin forbade him to marry her on the grounds that she was a mortal, not a goddess. Thor later asked Odin to reconsider the issue, and Odin relented, saying that Thor could marry her if she proved herself worthy. The superhuman criminal [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mister Hyde]], seeking vengeance against Blake, captured both him and Foster, and made Blake a prisoner in a room with a bomb. Blake escaped and, as Thor, battled Hyde; but Foster, fearing that only Hyde could save Blake's life by deactivating the bomb, helped Hyde to escape. Outraged by this seeming betrayal against his son, Odin rejected Thor's petition to marry Foster.{{r|Journey into Mystery #100}} Foster was menaced repeatedly by enemies of Thor who either knew he was Blake, or knew there was some connection between Thor and Blake. Such assailants included Hyde and his partner, the [[Klaus Voorhees (Earth-616)|Cobra]];{{r|Journey into Mystery #105}}{{r|Journey into Mystery #110}} his bitter foster-brother Loki;{{r|Journey into Mystery #108}}{{r|Journey into Mystery #110}}{{r|Journey into Mystery #115}} and the [[Amora (Earth-616)|Enchantress]] and her partner, the original [[Skurge (Earth-616)|Executioner]];{{r|Journey into Mystery #103}}{{r|Journey into Mystery #116|117}} as well as the journalist [[Harris Hobbs (Earth-616)|Harris Hobbs]].{{r|Journey into Mystery #120|122}} As Thor rescued her from these many perils over time, Foster fell deeply in love with him.{{citation}} 

===Chance at Godhood===
Finally, Thor defied Odin and revealed his dual-identity to Foster. Foster left America and took a position with a man who proved to be the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]]. Thor followed her to the High Evolutionary's citadel at [[Wundagore Mountain]], where they were reunited. Again petitioning Odin to let him marry Foster, Thor brought her to Asgard itself, a place forbidden to mortals. Odin agreed to let them marry if Foster proved herself capable of functioning as an Asgardian goddess. Odin then physically transformed Foster into an Asgardian, granting her superhuman powers. As Odin must have expected, Foster was confused and bewildered by her new abilities and by Asgard itself. Declaring that Foster had failed his test, Odin turned her back into a mortal woman, sent her back to Earth, and removed her memories of her experiences with Thor. Odin sent Foster to work for the physician [[Keith Kincaid (Earth-616)|Dr. Keith Kincaid]], and the two soon fell in love with each other.{{r|Thor #136}}

===Merged with Sif===
As for Thor, Odin saw to it that he was reunited the Asgardian goddess [[Sif (Earth-616)|Sif]], whom he had loved in the past, and their romance was quickly rekindled. Years later, Foster fell ill and, lying close to death, called out to Thor in her delirium.{{r|Thor #231}} Sif stole the enchanted [[Runestaff]] of [[Kamo Tharnn (Earth-616)|Kamo Tharnn]], the Elder of the Universe known as the Possessor,{{r|Thor #235}} and used it to infuse her own life-force into Foster, thereby saving her life. Sif vanished, and Foster recovered,{{r|Thor #236}} also regaining full possession of her lost memories of Thor. The love between Thor and Foster revived, but soon she was captured by trolls under the leadership of Thor's enemy Ulik. To Thor's surprise, Foster succeeded in capturing the troll king, [[Geirrodur (Earth-616)|Geirrodur]], with his own spear; Thor himself defeated [[Ulik (Earth-616)|Ulik]].{{r|Thor #238}}

Thereafter, Foster insisted on accompanying Thor on various exploits, traveling with him to the dimension of the god of [[Celestial Heliopolis|Heliopolis]], to the alternate future Earth ruled by the [[Artur Zarrko (Earth-6297)|Tomorrow Man]], and to the war-torn nation of Costa Verde. (Thor attributed Foster's new liking for adventure and fighting spirit to the presence of Sif's spirit within her, although it is possible that Foster's personality had simply evolved this way on its own.) After some time, Foster finally insisted on accompanying Thor to Asgard. There, the Asgardian Grand Vizier presented her with Sif's sword and when she struck it against a wall, she was seemingly transformed into Sif. The Vizier theorized that Foster and Sif had become one being, and that Sif would be dominant in Asgard, and Foster on Earth.{{r|Thor #249}} Yet when Sif returned to Earth many months later, she did not transform into Foster.{{r|Thor #327}}

Eventually, Dr. Kincaid launched an investigation into the whereabouts of Foster, whom he had not seen since her hospitalization. Thor revealed his dual-identity to Kincaid and explained what had happened to Foster. Thor and Sif took Kincaid with them on a journey to the world of Kamo Tharnn. It turned out that when Sif infused Foster with her life-force, Sif's own spirit and body had actually passed through the Runestaff and into another dimension. When Sif reappeared in Asgard, Foster took her place in the other dimension entered through the Runestaff. But when Kamo Tharnn somehow absorbed the denizens of the latter world into his own body, Sif and Thor used the Runestaff to release the beings trapped within the Possessor, including Foster. Thor and Sif brought Foster and Kincaid back to Earth, and Foster and Kincaid were married almost immediately afterward.{{r|Thor #334|335}}

===Civilian Life===
Since then, Thor has saved Foster's life from the creature called the [[Zaniac (Earth-616)|Zaniac]]. Foster has given birth to her first child, a boy named [[James Kincaid (Earth-616)|Jimmy]]. The world at large remains unaware of Foster's past relationship with Thor, although a few enterprising individuals have learned of their connection.{{r|Thor #372}}

Jane eventually became a doctor, and working alongside Thor in New York when the Odinson was secretly using the body of EMT [[Jake Olson]].{{r|Thor Vol 2 5}} She also became a consulting physician for Tony Stark.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #11|12}} During the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], she opposed the [[SHRA|Registration Act]] and joined the [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]], treating many of the members.{{r|Civil War #2}}

Some time later, she was visited by the [[Warriors Three (Earth-616)|Warriors Three]] to be informed about Thor's death after his battle against the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]].{{r|Fear Itself #7.2}}

===Return===
After hearing rumors of the return of Dr. Donald Blake and Thor, Jane divorced her husband and subsequently lost custody of their child. Blake visited Jane at her work in a New York City hospital in search of Lady Sif, whose spirit Blake mistakenly thought had been reborn in Jane since their spirits had been merged once before.{{r|Thor Vol 3 8}} Jane and Blake go on a date after an initially turbulent reuniting.{{r|Thor Vol 3 11}} Jane discovered that Sif's spirit had actually been reborn in the body of a dying elderly cancer patient that was under her care. She alerted Blake and Thor who managed to restore Sif just before the patient died.{{r|Thor #602}} Jane then traveled to [[Broxton]], [[Oklahoma (State)|Oklahoma]], the site of the resurrected [[Asgard (City)|City of Asgard]],{{r|Thor #606}} and opened a medical practice with Blake.{{r|Thor #602}}

[[File:Jane Foster (Earth-616) Thor God of Thunder Vol 1 12.jpg|left|thumb]]
===Becoming Thor===
While Thor was away fighting [[Gorr (God Butcher) (Earth-616)|Gorr]] the God Butcher, Jane was diagnosed with breast cancer.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #12}} She later accepted Thor's invitation to represent Midgard (Earth) in the [[Congress of Worlds (Earth-616)|Congress of Worlds]] on Asgard while she underwent therapy, but refused magical treatments.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #24}} During a battle against [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]], Thor lost the ability to wield his hammer Mjolnir.{{r|Original Sin #8}} The hammer remained unattended on the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]],{{r|Thor Vol 4 1}} from where it telepathically sought Jane out. Jane eventually gave in to the hammer's call, and requested [[Heimdall (Earth-616)|Heimdall]] to take her to the hammer's location.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 2 705}} Once there, Jane picked up Mjolnir, gaining Thor's powers and transforming and improving her physique.{{r|Thor Vol 4 1}} Since she had watched Thor use his hammer, Jane slowly learned how to use Mjolnir by example.{{r|Thor Vol 4 2}}

Jane soon found herself in the middle of [[Malekith (Earth-616)|Malekith the Accursed]]'s alliance with [[Frost Giants]] who were planning on bringing [[Laufey (Earth-616)|Laufey]] back to life.{{r|Thor Vol 4 2}} The original Thor soon caught up with Jane, demanding his hammer back.{{r|Thor Vol 4 3}} Thor ultimately accepted that the hammer had a new owner and gave Jane his blessing, still while not knowing her identity. He also gave Jane his name, and subsequently went by Odinson only.{{r|Thor Vol 4 4}}

When she tried to stop Malekith from making a deal with [[Dario Agger (Earth-616)|Dario Agger]] for Laufey's skull, Thor was suddenly attacked by [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Cul Borson]], who possessed the [[Destroyer (Enchanted Armor)|Destroyer Armor]], under orders from [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] to retrieve Mjolnir.{{r|Thor Vol 4 6}} Although Cul briefly managed to take Mjolnir from her, Thor summoned it back to her hand. Odinson, [[Freyja Freyrdottir (Earth-616)|Freyja]], and an army of the women he had identified as possible suspects for the new Thor's identity, arrived on scene and helped turn the tide of battle in Thor's favor, ultimately forcing the Destroyer to retreat. Thor's identity remained a mystery for Odinson and the rest of the world.{{r|Thor Vol 4 #7|8}}

[[File:Jane Foster (Earth-616) from Thor Vol 4 1 001.jpg|right|thumb|Lifting Mjolnir for the first time]]
===Secret Wars===
During the final incursion, Jane was one of the heroes that tried to stop Earth-1610 from destroying her Earth. After the vessel transporting the Earth's "resurrection team" was destroyed by the Children, Mr. Fantastic was forced to put the [[Future Foundation's Life Raft]] in action. As the Life Raft was deployed, Manifold teleported numerous heroes into it including Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Captain Marvel, and Cyclops, and Jane herself, which allowed them to survive the end of the Multiverse.{{r|Secret Wars #1}}

Thor and the other heroes transported onto the life raft were awakened by Doctor Strange eight years after the end of the multiverse and the creation of Battleworld, a planet cobbled together by segments of destroyed realities created and ruled by Doctor Doom.{{r|Secret Wars #3}} Thor and the others were later teleported by Strange to confront the Cabal after a distress call was sent to him by one member of the Thor Corps, and after this Doom himself appeared to quell the fighting. When Doom tried to kill them, Doctor Strange teleported them across Battleworld, but at the cost of his own life.{{r|Secret Wars #4}} Jane then decided to infiltrate the Thor Corps to turn them against Doom with the help of the Thor of Higher Avalon{{r|Secret Wars #5}} and eventually succeeded and led them to Doomstadt, where they confronted the Barons defending the castle, and led to the restoration of the Multiverse.{{r|Secret Wars #8|9}}

[[File:Jane Foster (Earth-616) from Mighty Thor Vol 3 1 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
===All-New, All-Different===
Foster remained in [[Asgardia]] as a senator in the Congress of Worlds, and as Thor she remained a fugitive pursued by Cul. Odinson was considered missing. She became involved in the war between [[Svartalfheim]], realm of the [[Dark Elves]], and [[Alfheim]], realm of the [[Light Elves]] and encountered several incarnations of Loki. After the elf races struck a deal by wedding their respective monarchs, Thor returned to Asgard to confront the power-mad Odin, who had Frigga on trial. Loki and Thor arrived at the point when the All-Mother was about to be placed on a verdict by Odin. The rebellious Asgardian warriors also made their way into the hall fighting Cul's Thunderguard. Thor and Odin got into a crunching battle that wandered across Saturn's moons while it was revealed that Loki was a spy for Frigga. Loki then stabbed Frigga halting the battles at hand.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 1|5}}

Thor was once again a member of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. She appeared by chance in their encounter with [[Warbringer (Earth-616)|Warbringer]] and subsequently agreed to help form a new official Avengers group.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers #1|3}} Her identity was unknown to her teammates until she was separated from the hammer when she was transferred a few days into the future by [[Kang the Conqueror]], and [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Sam Wilson]], the new Captain America, witnessed her as she reverted to Jane.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers #5}} He agreed to keep it secret, even visiting her during chemotherapy so that she could have a friend to talk to.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers #6}}

===[[Secret Empire (Event)|Secret Empire]]===
In spite of her illness, Jane was among the superheroes that answered [[Anthony Stark (Third A.I.) (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]'s call to defend [[Washington, D.C.]] during [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s takeover of the [[United States of America]]. Unbeknownst to Jane however, [[Elisa Sinclair (Earth-61311)|Madame Hydra]] secretly used a shard of the [[Cosmic Cube]] to alter Mjolnir's enchantment so it could be lifted by the "strongest" rather than "worthiest." As a result, the alternate [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America]] was able to lift Mjolnir, and soundly defeated Thor before banishing her to another dimension.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2017 Secret Empire}} 

Upon waking up in the new dimension, Jane encountered the farmer [[Hecla (Earth-616)|Hecla]], who provided her with shelter and listened to her story. Though he believed she was delusional, Hecla agreed to help Thor find a device that would return her to Earth and even created a makeshift hammer for her to wield in place of Mjolnir. As the two traveled together, Hecla grew to believe Jane's claims of godhood after she effortlessly defeated a group of monsters and saved him from being struck by lightning. Thor and Hecla eventually found the device in the possession of the monster [[Yod (Ruler) (Earth-616)|Yod]], who fatally injured the latter as he attempted to hand the device to Jane. Using the makeshift hammer Hecla gave her, Thor smashed Yod's orb, killing the monster. She then proceeded to use the device to return to Earth.{{r|Avengers Vol 7 9}}

Though she was still without Mjolnir, Jane still participated in the superheroes final assault on Washington D.C., in a last ditch effort to defeat Captain America and return the United States to normal. Following Hydra's end, Mjolnir was given back to Jane.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}}

===Death of the Mighty Thor===
Unfortunately for Jane, all progress from chemotherapy became lost whenever she used Mjolnir to transform into Thor. Since the magical transformation purged all toxins from Jane's body, it did so to the chemotherapy drugs, but left the cancer behind since it was part of her body. As Jane found herself having to transform into Thor more often, her cancer metastasized and reached stage four. Jane was told by Doctor Strange that if she became Thor one last time, she would die. He and several of her friends convinced Jane to give up being Thor for the sake of her health.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 2 703}} That changed, though, when Jane learned that the city of Asgardia was flying towards the [[Sun (Star)|Sun]] due to the actions of the [[Mangog (Earth-616)|Mangog]], who wanted to kill off all the Asgardians. She chose to become Thor one last time to save Asgardia, even if it killed her, and went on to confront Mangog.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 2 704}}

Jane received a brutal beating from Mangog despite her best efforts. She resorted to hurling Mangog into the Sun, but Mangog was able to return to Asgardia to continue his rampage. In order to finally stop Mangog, she tied him up with chains originally created to bind the [[Fenris Wolf (Earth-616)|Fenris Wolf]] before tying the chains to Mjolnir and hurling the hammer into the Sun, taking Mangog with it. Jane shared a final kiss with Odinson before reverting to her human form and succumbing to her cancer. Odinson then fled with Jane's lifeless body from Asgardia before it exploded and landed upon the Moon where his fellow Asgardians had evacuated to.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 2 705}} Refusing to accept Jane's death, Odinson channeled the [[God Tempest (Earth-616)|God Tempest]] that was contained within the now-destroyed Mjolnir and tried to use its power to bring Jane back to life. At the same time, Jane's soul stood hesitant on the gates of [[Valhalla (Afterlife)|Valhalla]]. Having come to accept Jane as one of their own due to her sacrifice, Odin joined his son's efforts, and together they revived her. Without Mjolnir's power to transform her, Jane focused her undivided attention to chemotherapy. She additionally convinced Odinson to reclaim his name and continue fighting the [[War of the Realms]] on her behalf.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 2 706}}

===War of the Realms===
When Malekith and the [[Dark Council (Earth-616)|Dark Council]] launched a worldwide invasion of Midgard, Jane joined in the fight and fought alongside other Asgardians in defending New York City. However, the invaders were too numerous, forcing Jane and the other defenders to retreat to [[Avengers Mountain]].{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 1|2}} Jane became the Asgardians' temporary All-Mother when Queen Frigga left with a group of heroes to destroy Malekith's [[Black Bifrost]] and helped organized the defense of Earth as well as defend Old Asgard from Malekith's forces.{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 3}}

When it appeared that Odin and Frigga had died when the Black Bifrost was destroyed, Jane gave a speech to rally Earth's defenders but was interrupted when Thor appeared to lead Earth's defense.{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 4}} During the counterattack on the Dark Council, Jane and Agent Solomon led an attack in Antarctica against the forces of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]]. After learning from Heimdall that Thor was suffering in order to learn how to rescue his parents from Malekith, Jane told him that Thor shouldn't have to search alone. She later stated that there must always been a Thor and sometimes there more than one was needed. So, she picked up the broken remains of the Ultimate Universe's Mjolnir and once again transformed into her Thor form.{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 5}}

[[File:Jane Foster (Earth-616) from War of the Realms Vol 1 6 002.jpg|thumb|right|Jane's new vambrace]]
Jane joined Thor and his past and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-14412)|future]] counterparts in the mission to rescue Odin and Frigga from Malekith at [[Stonehenge]]. Malekith was eventually defeated when Thor used the reforged Mjolnir to strike the villain down. With her Mjolnir capable of only taking one more blow, Jane used it to knock out one of the eyes of King Laufey. When the hammer returned to her, it fell apart but then recombined into a [[Undrjarn|vambrace]] that covered her left arm.{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 6}}

As she looked over the bodies of the fallen [[Valkyrior (Earth-616)|Valkyries]] in a morgue, Thor came to retrieve the corpses while lamenting that there was no way for the fallen to go to [[Valhalla (Afterlife)|Valhalla]] with the Valkyries dead. Reacting to the vambrace on Jane's arm, the spirits of [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Brunnhilde]] and the other Valkyries appeared. Brunnhilde asked Jane if she would become a Valkyrie. Jane agreed and was transformed into a Valkyrie.{{r|War of the Realms Omega Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = The spirit of Brunnhilde transformed Jane into Valkyrie,{{r|War of the Realms Omega Vol 1 1}} therefore giving her the following traits:

'''Asgardian Physiology:''' Jane possesses all of the various superhuman attributes common among the Asgardians.
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' As a Valkyrie, Jane possesses superhuman strength like all Asgardians. She is strong enough to hold and lift a car over her head.{{r|Valkyrie: Jane Foster Vol 1 1}}
* '''Superhuman Speed:''' As a Valkyrie, Jane can run and move at speeds that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.{{r|Valkyrie: Jane Foster Vol 1 1}}

| title = Former Powers
| body  = As Thor, Jane wielded [[Mjolnir]], and like those before her, she had been bestowed with power equal to that once possessed by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Odinson]]; whatever powers she may or may not possess outside of those provided by Mjolnir are unknown:
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' Thor possesses class 100 strength and is easily capable of lifting 100 tons.{{citation}}
* '''Superhuman Speed'''{{citation}}
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' While in the form of an Asgardian Goddess, Thor possesses virtual invulnerability and immunity to all known Earthly diseases and infections.{{citation}}
* '''Superhuman Stamina'''{{citation}}
* '''Superhuman Senses'''{{citation}}
* '''Self-Sustenance:''' She is capable of surviving in the vacuum of space unaided.{{citation}}
* '''Healing Factor:''' Like all Asgardians, Thor has a highly advanced metabolism that enables her to recover with superhuman speed and efficiency. While the extent of ability to heal is unknown, it doesn't appear to be able to heal her cancer. Instead, the cancer appears to be suppressed and isn't lethal to Thor as long as Thor retains her Asgardian form.{{citation}}
* '''Longevity'''{{citation}}
* '''Energy Manipulation'''{{citation}}
** '''''Lightning/Electrokinesis:''''' Thor usually uses Mjolnir to channel her storm abilities, but she is capable of discharging lightning bolts without it; notably using to destroy a frost giant's head from the inside.{{r|Thor Vol 4 3}}

'''[[Phoenix Force]]:''' During the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]]'s tournament, Valkyrie became empowered by a portion of its power.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 41}} She was stripped of this boost after losing to [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|Hulk]], which disqualified her from the contest.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 42}}

| Abilities               = '''Nursing Skills:''' Initially Jane was a competent and effective nurse.{{citation}}

'''Medical Training:''' After years as a nurse, Jane completed her medical training and obtained a Medical degree.{{citation}}
| Strength                = The strength of a woman who engages in regular exercise. As Thor or Valkyrie, she appears to be a competent fighter.

| title = Former Weaknesses
| body  = '''Separation from Mjolnir:''' Similar to the previous enchantments involving Don Blake and Eric Masterson, Thor's powers were derived from Mjolnir; separation from it for more than a minute resulted in her powers fading quickly.{{r|Thor Vol 4 2}}
'''[[Glossary:Cancer|Breast Cancer]]:''' Jane was diagnosed with breast cancer.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #12}} She later accepted Thor's invitation to represent Midgard in the [[Congress of Worlds (Earth-616)|Congress of Worlds]] on [[Asgardia]] while she underwent therapy, but refused magical treatments.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #24}} While empowered [[Mjolnir]] she was at perfect health.{{r|Thor Vol 4 2}} But when she returned to normal the chemotherapy was removed from her system, preventing the treatment from working and endangering her life.{{r|Thor Vol 4 8}} After Mjolnir's destruction, Jane finally got the treatment she desperately needed and is now in complete remission.{{citation}}

| Equipment               = '''[[Undrjarn|Undrjarn the All-Weapon]]:''' A vambrace created from the remains of the [[Mjolnir]] of [[Earth-1610]].{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 6}} It has the ability to change into various type of weapon, as its wielder desires.{{r|Valkyrie: Jane Foster Vol 1 1}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Equipment
| body  = '''[[Mjolnir]]:''' Mjolnir is a symbolic weapon of Thor, a hammer forged from Uru metal, whose chief properties are durability, the ability to maintain enchantment, and absorb energies. Mjolnir resembles more of a short handle mallet than a traditional warhammer. Mjolnir itself is already extremely durable, and combined with the various enchantments placed upon it by Odin, is even harder. It has survived heat as extreme as the heart of the Sun, and blasts powerful enough to destroy planets.
* '''Worthiness Enchantment:''' This enchantment surrounding Mjolnir prevents it from being wielded by anyone save those who have been found worthy. Thus far, this includes Thor, Thunderstrike, the Red Norvell, Beta Ray Bill, and Captain America. To anyone else, Mjolnir cannot be lifted from the ground nor wrested from Thor's grip. Those who are deemed worthy are able to wield Thor's powers. Captain America said "I've never wielded such limitless power before!"{{r|Thor #390}} "It's almost intoxicating!"{{r|Avengers #4}} Recently the enchantment has changed to the point that Odin; its creator can no longer carry it (or presumably bypass the enchantment),{{citation}} whether Beta Ray Bill and others are still considered worthy is unknown.
* '''Transformation:''' Jane Foster can use Mjolnir to transform into her Thor persona.{{citation}}
* '''Mystical Link'''{{citation}}
* '''Flight:''' Thor is capable of hurling Mjolnir with great force and, by holding onto the leather thong, is capable of flying through the air at tremendous speeds. While in an Earth-like atmosphere, Thor generally flies at roughly the Speed of Sound, roughly 770 miles per hour. The hammer can also be directed from a distance; this aspect was used offensively against the frost giants during her debut.{{r|Thor Vol 4 3}}
* '''Weather Control'''{{citation}}
* '''Energy Projection:''' With Mjolnir, Thor can project powerful mystical blasts of energy.{{citation}}
* '''Teleportation'''{{citation}}
* '''[[Allspeak]]:''' Thanks to the Allspeak, Jane can communicate and be understood by all races.
'''Ultimate Universe's Mjolnir''': After picking up the Mjolnir of the [[Earth-1610|Ultimate Universe]], Jane regained the powers she had as Thor. Eventually, the hammer fell apart, returning Jane to her normal form.{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 5|6}}

She even called out Thor's real name to get her attention, much to Thor's shock.{{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 2}}
