| History                 = As a young man, Eric Koenig was a member of the Nazi Youth Group alongside his friend [[Wilhelm Hauser (Earth-616)|Wilhelm Hauser]]. When [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1935 they both joined the Wehrmacht, but in the 1939 invasion of Poland Eric began to doubt Hitler's leadership. Wilhelm, however, was completely devoted to Hitler and the two men drifted apart. 

Eric joined the Luftwaffe in Nazi Germany, but was transferred out of that service when he became an aide to Dr. Draus. Koenig came to resent how Draus treated him as a mere underling. Eric was attending Dr. Draus at an inn when [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] was discovered in the inn and fought with German soldiers. Draus ordered Koenig to protect him but he was convinced by Fury to switch sides and come work for people who would appreciate his talents. Eric turned on Draus and he and Fury forced him to pilot a plane back to England where they placed Dr. Draus into custody and Koenig was introduced to [[Samuel Sawyer (Earth-616)|Sam Sawyer]]. Eric then shared all of the intelligence he had with the Allies as part of his defection to their side. 

Eric was then assigned to assist Sgt. Fury, Bull McGiveney and "Rickets" Johnson of the Maulers in rescuing the other [[Howling Commandos (WWII) (Earth-616)|Howling Commandos]] from Germany. Bull and Rickets didn't trust Eric and even got into a fight with him, but Eric remained adamant about his decision to fight for the allies. Eric piloted the team in a captured German plane, but later had to abandon it for fear that their cover had been blown. Eric took the team to his sister [[Ilsa Koenig (Earth-616)|Ilsa]] who told them that the Howlers were going to be executed in Berlin by Hitler himself. They managed to sneak in and save the Howlers, though [[Dino Manelli (Earth-616)|Dino Manelli]] was badly injured in the escape. Ilsa helped them get out of Germany, and they made their way back to England. 

Sawyer named Koenig to be Manelli's replacement while he was injured and later placed on a special assignment. Later Koenig replaced [[Isadore Cohen (Earth-616)|Izzy Cohen]] when he was a prisoner of war. Upon Cohen's return, Koenig stayed as a member of the team. At one point, Koenig seemingly defected back to join the Nazi cause{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 65}}, but he secretly remained loyal to the allies, working as a spy and aiding the Howling commandos on several occasions. He was retrieved by the Commandos, together with his girlfriend [[Coral Liebowitz (Earth-616)|Coral Liebowitz]] {{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 78}} and put on trial, where he was cleared of all charges. he then rejoined the Howlers {{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 79}}. 

Koenig became a naturalized American citizen in 1946 and was recruited into the foreign service, becoming stationed in [[Doomstadt|Hassenstadt]], [[Latveria]]. In the late 1950s, he began working with [[Louise Grant (Earth-616)|Louise Mason]], a government operative codenamed the Blonde Phantom, who was stationed in Latveria to discover and neutralize any Nazi war criminals who may have been hiding out there. Discovering what they believed to be a large Nazi plot, Koenig contacted his old friend Nick Fury and had him come to Latveria to follow up on the Blonde Phantom's lead. Koenig and Fury then spoke to the [[Wakanda|Wakandan]] diplomat in Hassenstadt, who informed them that their prince [[T'Chaka (Earth-616)|T'Chaka]] had been kidnapped, believing it to have been done by the same group that Fury was chasing.{{r|Avengers 1959 Vol 1 2}} Once this group, known as [[ICON (1950s) (Earth-616)|ICON]], was defeated by Fury's [[Avengers (1950s) (Earth-616)|Avengers]], the State Department was given the whereabouts of the Wakandan prince in exchange for their freedom. T'Chaka was being held in a castle in Hassenstadt, so Koenig and [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum-Dum Dugan]] were sent to rescue him.{{r|Avengers 1959 Vol 1 5}} 

He was one of the Howlers that joined Nick Fury in forming [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. 

When S.H.I.E.L.D. was dismantled and replaced by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]], Koenig follow with many agents into the new organisation, as a mole for the [[Howling Commandos Private Military Company (Earth-616)|Private military company "Howling Commandos"]].

He was eventually killed during a fight with forces of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], shot in the head while fighting alongside longtime comrade [[Gabriel Jones (Earth-616)|Gabe Jones]]. Gabe died almost immediately afterwards, attempting to avenge Eric's death.{{r|Secret Warriors #19}}
