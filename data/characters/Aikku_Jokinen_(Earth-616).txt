| History                 = ===Encountering Pod===
Aikku Jokinen was an ethnically Finnish Norwegian girl in the proximity of the crash landing of one of [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]]'s creations, the [[Planetary Operational Defense System (Earth-616)|Pod System Armor]], which was launched towards the planet by an evolution bomb and designed to serve as [[Earth]]'s self defense mechanism.

Aikku was bonded with the suit, and remained in a cocoon,{{r|Avengers Vol 5 38}} which was discovered by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 4}} Once she hatched from her cocoon, with her mind having been taken over by the armor, Pod proceeded to fly to [[Australia]] where the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] were fighting other creations of Ex Nihilo's in [[Perth]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 15}} She quickly defeated the Avengers, adapting to their attacks and strategies,{{r|Avengers Vol 5 16}} and was soon confronted by [[Deidre Wentworth (Earth-616)|Deidre Wentworth]], who managed to capture Pod once more for experimentation, firstly by placing her in [[Exo-Space|the space between two dead universes]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 17}}

[[File:Aikku Jokinen (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 5 16 001.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Merged with Pod]]
===New Avengers===
When [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Bobby Da Costa]] became the leader of A.I.M., he rescued Pod and stored her in his office.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 36}} After he decided to tackle the problem the [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]] represented, Sunspot sent Pod with [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]] to [[Japan]], to activate the self-replicating mechanism for Earth, that created an army of duplicates of Shang-Chi.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 38}}

Pod eventually became Sunspot's bodyguard and a member of the [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|New Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 1}} An [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] engineer, [[Toni Ho (Earth-616)|Dr. Toni Ho]], became interested on studying her, and while running a diagnostic on her, Aikku revealed she had become increasingly lonely ever since her girlfriend, [[Darja Vollun (Earth-616)|Darja]], told her she couldn't love her because of what she had become.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 3}}

As Toni continued investigating Pod and started to fall in love with the person within the armor, she discovered that while Aikku could come out of the suit, the process would cause the Pod A.I. system to reset and effectively terminate its current self, which meant that it wasn't the armor itself what forced Aikku to give up on a normal life, rather her desire to sustain Pod. Barely a few moments after making this discovery, Pod and Toni were targeted by the [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]] and [[Skar]] when the [[New Revengers (Earth-616)|New Revengers]] attacked A.I.M.'s [[Avenger Base Two]], and Pod was fatally damaged.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 13}} The injuries to Pod's body were of such an extent that the suit wasn't capable of healing both Aikku and itself, so it chose its user, and freed her from the armor as it went offline. Aikku still retained a portion of the Pod armor, an undersuit that was more streamlined in appearance, but suffered great grief over the loss of Pod.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 15}}

Aikku was subsequently aided in getting used to the mechanics of the [[Pod Undersuit]] by Toni. After the pair shut down [[Advanced Genocide Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.G.M.]], an A.I.M. splinter group, Aikku expressed her gratitude for Toni's support and both girls confessed their feelings for each other, then shared a kiss before joining the newest [[American Intelligence Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], a joint operation between [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Army]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 18}}

===No Surrender===
When the different teams of Avengers were caught in the middle of a contest between the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]]'s [[Lethal Legion (Grandmaster) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]] and the [[Challenger (Elder of the Universe) (Earth-616)|Challenger]]'s [[Black Order (Earth-616)|Black Order]], Enigma was one of the countless heroes from across the globe that became trapped in stasis.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 676}} Due to the nature of the contest, a frozen hero was always freed from stasis whenever there was a casualty.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 680}} After [[Red Wolf (Earth-51920)|Red Wolf]] was abducted to the [[Grandmaster's Cosmic Game Room]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 682}} Enigma was freed.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 683}}

Not long afterwards, the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] attacked the [[Avengers Auxiliary Headquarters]] on behalf of the Challenger to retrieve the final [[Pyramoids|Pyramoid]], a type of artifact each of the Elders' teams had to fight for during each round of their contest. Enigma was one of the Avengers still at the base, and attempted to confront the rampaging monster. Despite her best efforts, the Hulk destroyed the Enigma armor with ease,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684}} resulting in a similar loss as when the Pod armor had died.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 685}}

===No Road Home===
During a universal blackout caused by the return of the primordial goddess [[Nyx (Earth-616)|Nyx]], Aikku was shown to have come into the possession of a new armor dubbed [[Planetary Operational Defense System 2 (Earth-616)|Pod-2]]. She and Toni were working in conjuntion with [[G.I.R.L.]] scientists and [[Adam Brashear (Earth-616)|Blue Marvel]] to run worldwide crisis relief as part of his [[Avengers World (Earth-616)|Avengers World]] initiative.{{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 9}}

She previously exhibited various powers due to her interaction as the user interfaced with [[Planetary Operational Defense System (Earth-616)|an artificially intelligent armor]] derived from advanced alien technologies,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 15}} and later retained some capability with the [[Pod Undersuit|armor's undersuit]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 18}} She now boasts new abilities thanks to the second iteration of her former battle suit in [[Planetary Operational Defense System 2 (Earth-616)|Pod-2]].{{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 9}}

|body = '''[[Pod Undersuit|Enigma Suit]]:''' When Aikku and the [[Planetary Operational Defense System (Earth-616)|Pod System Armor]] were fatally injured,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 13}} the sentient suit gave up its life to heal Aikku; however, its undersuit remained with the young girl,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 15}} giving her the following abilities:
*'''Energy Blasts:''' Aikku can unleash energy blasts from her hands.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 1}}
*'''Density Manipulation:''' Pod's undersuit is capable of altering its own density, to the point of rendering herself hard as a diamond.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 3}}
**'''Flight:''' The density alteration makes Aikku capable of becoming weightless and float.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 1}}
**'''Phasing:''' Aikku's density manipulation allows her to move between atoms and molecules to go through solid objects. She can also touch other people to turn them intangible.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 1}}
*'''Image Inducer:''' Enigma's armor comes equipped with a holographic disguise, which gives Aikku the possibility to appear unarmored while actually having the armor on.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 3}}
**'''Camouflage:''' Enigma can use the image inducer to blend in with her surroundings, turning virtually invisible.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 3}}
**'''Laser:''' Due to the image inducer's nature as a device which bends and focuses light, it can be programmed to generate a potent laser which is fired from the armor's eye.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 3}}
'''[[Planetary Operational Defense System (Earth-616)|Pod System Armor]]:''' Aikku's powers came from the armor to which she was bonded. These included:
*'''Flight:''' Pod could fly at supersonic speeds.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 16}}
*'''Arsenal:''' Pod was equipped with a variety of weapons.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 16}}
**'''Eye Beam:''' From the armor's eye, Pod could fire a powerful laser, which was capable of hurting beings like [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] and [[Marcus Milton (Earth-13034)|Hyperion]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 16}}
**'''Energy Blasts:''' Pod could fire powerful blasts of energy.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 16}}
**'''Mines:''' Pod could launch explosive mines from its body.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 16}}
*'''Shield Generation:''' Pod could create an energy shield around itself.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 16}}
*'''Invulnerability''' Pod was capable of surviving in extremely harsh environments, like the nothingness left by [[Glossary:Incursion|the collision of two universes]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 16}}
*'''Power-Level Adaption:''' The Pod armor's greatest, if not more likely, primary ability is to adjust and augment its on-board systems and parameters to counter and exceed any opposing force it has set itself against. Having been able to study and steadily boost itself to considerable enough degrees to take on, and out, all of [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Earth's Mightiest]] single handed.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 16}}
