| Quotation               = In [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|your]] tiny head, perhaps the line between a criminal enterprise and an empire is thin. In reality, '''nobody cares.''' All they care about is who holds the gun, and where they're pointing it.

| History                 = J'son was the only son of the previous Emperor of [[Spartax (Planet)|Spartax]], and therefore sole heir to the throne. He was summoned by his father when war broke out between the Spartax and the [[Badoon]]. On his way back home, he was forced to crash land on [[Earth]], where he fell in love with a [[human]] woman named [[Meredith Quill (Earth-616)|Meredith Quill]]. The two began a short relationship before J'son was forced to leave to wage war for the Spartax. Meredith would later go on to give birth to his son, [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Peter Quill]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 0.1}}

===Loss of his empire===
[[File:J'son (Earth-616) from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 1 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
Years later, J'son joined other members of the [[Galactic Council (Earth-616)|Galactic Council]] to declare the [[Earth]] off-limits to extraterrestrial interaction.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 1}} Once his son defended Earth from a [[Badoon]] attack, J'son sent Spartax soldiers to capture him and his team of [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 2}} However, the Guardians managed to escape and flee.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 3}}

In an attempt to finally get rid of the Guardians and make his son join him, all of the Guardians were separately dealt with by the [[Spartax Empire]] and its allies. However, they didn't count with the Guardians' ally Captain Marvel,{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 14}} who saved Peter Quill from J'son and the Spartax Empire. As he was escaping, Quill discredited J'son to the whole empire, revealing him as a heartless murderer. The entire Spartax Empire rebelled against J'son, who was forced to flee.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 16}}

===Mister Knife===
With no longer an empire or fortune, J'son became the villain known as Mister Knife, and started building a criminal empire.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord #6}} He put a bounty on his son,{{r|Legendary Star-Lord #2}} and also assembled the [[Slaughter Lords (Earth-616)|Slaughter Squad]] to recover the [[Black Vortex]].

Because of the price put on his head, Star-Lord began raiding Mister Knife's crime syndicate, unaware that he was dealing with his own father.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord #5}} When the Slaughter Squad managed to finally capture Star-Lord while he was on a date with [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]], Mister Knife revealed his identity to his son.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord #6}} After Peter escaped with the help of Pryde, who travelled all the way from Earth to save him, J'son tracked down to a planet the son of Thanos, [[Thane (Earth-616)|Thane]],{{r|Legendary Star-Lord #7}} and convinced him to join his cause.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord #8}}

Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde decided to steal the Black Vortex from J'son with the sole purpose to annoy him, in retaliation, Mister Knife sent the Slaughter Lords to hunt them down and recover the Vortex.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: Black Vortex Alpha #1}} After numerous failed attempts to recover the Vortex, Mister Knife managed to get his hands on it. As part of a deal with Thane, the son of Thanos submitted to the Black Vortex and used his cosmically enhanced power to encase the entirety of Spartax in his amber construct. The trapped Spartax was later traded to the Brood by Mister Knife, in exchange for taking advantage of their expansion and acquiring one planet for every ten worlds they conquered ever since.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord #10}}

At a moment when [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] retrieved the Black Vortex, she was cornered by Thane and J'son, who demanded she give them the Vortex back. When Thane tried to use his powers to encase Carol in amber, she used the Black Vortex as a shield and deflected the attack towards J'son.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 8 14}}

J'son remained encased in the amber construct floating through Spartax's orbit after the planet was freed by [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]], until he was found by the Collector, who was too late to recover the Vortex, but settled for adding J'son to his collection.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: Black Vortex Omega #1}} While still encased in amber, J'son was recovered by his daughter [[Victoria (Spartax) (Earth-616)|Victoria]] and brought back to Spartax.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord #12}}

| Notes                   = * Although inspired by the [[Jason (Earth-791)|Emperor Jason of Sparta]] who first appeared in {{cl|Marvel Preview Vol 1 11}}, the current [[Earth-616]] incarnation of J'Son was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and first appeared in {{cl|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 0.1}}.
* [[Jason (Spartoi) (Earth-616)|Prince Jason of Spartax]] who first appeared in [[Inhumans Vol 3 2]] was originally meant to be a younger version of this Emperor J'son and the future father of [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Peter Quill]]. That Jason was a member of the [[Spartoi]] race and heir to the throne of the [[Spartoi Empire]] that existed in the Greater Magellanic Cloud{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files #1|; Spartoi entry}} of [[Earth-616|Reality-616]]. However, a retcon in {{cl|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 0.1}} revealed that the father of the Star-Lord who was born on Earth-616 was actually a member of the [[Spartax (Race)|Spartax race]] from another planet named [[Spartax (Planet)|Spartax]] and heir to the throne of the [[Spartax Empire]] that apparently existed in the Milky Way Galaxy. Subsequently, it was decided that classic Emperor Jason, his empire and the Star-Lord who was his son actually existed in the [[Earth-791]] reality.  This left [[Jason (Spartoi) (Earth-616)|Prince Jason]] from 2000 as character separate from both the classic [[Jason (Earth-791)|Jason]] who appeared in 1977-1980 an the modern J'son who appeared from 2013 onwards.
*The idea that J'Son is a member of the Spartoi race is a holdover from when Prince Jason of Spartax, the heir to the throne of the Spartoi Empire, was presumed to be the father of this reality's Star-Lord. However, since the Bendis retcon, the name "Spartax" has been used exclusively in in-story references to J'Son's race. Specifically, he is a member of the Spartax race who ruled the Spartax Empire from their home planet of Spartax. Despite this, no official distinction between the Spartoi race who appeared or was mentioned in stories from 2000 to 2011 and the Spartax race who have appeared since 2013 has ever been made.
