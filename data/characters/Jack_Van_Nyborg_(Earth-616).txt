| History                 = Van Nyborg was the leader of a cult who worshiped the [[Nameless One (Undying Ones Leader) (Earth-616)|Nameless One]] and the [[Undying Ones]]. His cult kidnapped an unconscious [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] after he battled the [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]].{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 125}} Van Nyborg wanted to use Banner's alter-ego of the Hulk to battle the Nameless One's mortal enemy, the [[Dark-Crawler (Earth-616)|Night-Crawler]].{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 126}}

Van Nyborg later resurfaced in Cobbler's Roost, [[Vermont (State)|Vermont]], in another attempt to bring the Nameless One to Earth. [[Celestia Denton (Earth-616)|Celestia Denton]] promised her daughter, [[Barbara Norriss (Earth-616)|Barbara Norriss]]' soul to the Nameless One in exchange for her youth and beauty back. The cultists made a headquarters beneath Barbara's old family homestead. The scheme was thwarted by the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] and [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]], and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] hypnotized van Nyborg and the other cultists.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 20}}

| Powers                  = It appears that van Nyborg has at least some skill in the mystical arts as he was able to call on such mystical entities as [[Satannish (Earth-616)|Satannish]], [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]], and [[Watoomb (Earth-616)|Watoomb]] when sending Banner into the Night-Crawler's dimension. He could also fire mystical bolts from his hands that were powerful enough to stagger even Doctor Strange.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 20}}
