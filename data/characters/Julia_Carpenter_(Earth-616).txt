| History                 = 
===Early Life===
Julia Cornwall was born and raised in [[Los Angeles]], [[California (State)|California]]. The daughter of [[Walter Cornwall (Earth-616)|Walter]] and [[Elizabeth Cornwall (Earth-616)|Elizabeth Cornwall]]. She met and married her college sweetheart [[Larry Carpenter (Earth-616)|Larry Carpenter]] and together they had a daughter named [[Rachel Carpenter (Earth-616)|Rachel]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 214}}

===Being Spider-Woman===
A secretive government group called the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities (Earth-616)|Commission]] decided to create their own superhero. [[Valerie Cooper (Earth-616)|Val Cooper]] met college friend Julia Carpenter in [[Denver]], and convinced her to be part in an "athletic study." She was unknowingly a test subject in their experiments. During the experiment, they "accidentally" injected Julia with a mix of spider venom and exotic plant extracts, which gave Julia powers very similar to those of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 2 2}}

Not long after she was given identity of Spider-Woman, she was drawn into the first [[Secret Wars (1984 Event)|Secret Wars]].{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 #6|12}} After returning to Earth, Julia joined [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 206}} but much like her predecessor, found herself on the wrong side of the law.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 #8|9}} She left the team when she helped the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] escape the [[Vault]].{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 15}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 9}}

===Amazing Friends===
She teamed up with [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] when she was stalked by a trio of high-tech bounty hunters known as the [[Seekers (Earth-616)|Seekers]]. They came to collect the bounty which had been placed on Julia's head. She was wanted by the US government after she helped the Avengers. Iron Man decided to help her with her daughter's situation. They battle the bounty hunters but it ends when she decided to surrender to the US government.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 214}}

She teamed up with Spider-Man to battle the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]] and eventually found herself as a freelance hero.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 #125|126}} When one of her assignments led her to California looking for a team of Asian super-villains, she met and assisted the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]] several times.{{r|Avengers: West Coast Vol 1 70|101}}

===Deathweb===
Julia's main enemies were the arachnid-based team called [[Deathweb (Earth-616)|Death-Web]], which consisted of three super-villains who were created by the Commission, using a variation of the same serum that transformed Julia.{{r|{{cl|Spider-Woman Vol 2 1}}-[[Spider-Woman Vol 2 2|2]]}}

[[File:Julia Carpenter (Earth-616) from Force Works Vol 1 19 001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Julia in Force Works]]
When [[Michael Clemson (Earth-616)|Mike Clemson]], founder of Death-Web, captured Spider-Woman's daughter Rachel, he blackmailed her into fighting Spider-Man, even though she nearly killed Spider-Man, she couldn't commit murder, and Spider-Man helped her rescue Rachel.{{r|{{cl|Spider-Woman Vol 2 3}}-[[Spider-Woman Vol 2 4|4]]}}

She then found her place with the West Coast Avengers and once they disbanded, joined their spin-off team [[Force Works (Earth-616)|Force Works]].{{r|Force Works Vol 1 #1|22}}

===Spider-Women===
Eventually, Julia walked away from the superhero business to concentrate on raising her daughter. Like [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Jessica Drew]] (the original Spider-Woman), Julia was also attacked by [[Charlotte Witter (Earth-616)|Charlotte Witter]] and had her powers stolen. After the loss of her superpowers, Julia returned to the life of a normal mother.{{r|{{cl|Spider-Woman Vol 3 1}}-[[Spider-Woman Vol 3 4|4]]}}

Julia was paralyzed for several months after she lost her powers, even though all of her other injuries had healed. The [[Maximillian Coleridge (Earth-616)|Shroud]]'s company synthesized a duplicate of the serum that originally provided Julia with her powers, and these returned several days after it was administered to her. With the Shroud's help, Julia underwent intense physical therapy and was soon able to walk again. It was during this time that she and the Shroud fell in love.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 #7}}

===Civil War/Initiative===
[[File:Julia Carpenter (Earth-616) from Ms. Marvel Vol 2 13 0001.jpg|left|thumb]]
Her powers now restored, Julia returned using the code name "Arachne" (which she originally intended to use). During the Superhuman [[Civil War]], Julia registered under the [[Superhuman Registration Act]],{{r|Civil War Files Vol 1 1}} and she and [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] aided [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] in the training of novice superheroes.{{r|Civil War: The Initiative Vol 1 1}}

However, Julia was actually a double agent; when she first responded to Iron Man's request, she thought they would be helping people escape registration.{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report Vol 1 1}} She tipped off several targeted superheroes who had refused to register with the government, such as the [[Hobie Brown (Earth-616)|Prowler]]. She was by now romantically involved with the Shroud, an opponent of the Superhuman Registration Act.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 #6|8}}

Julia was found out when a captured Prowler revealed under interrogation that she had tipped him off. A government strike team led by Ms. Marvel, including Wonder Man and [[Anya Corazon (Earth-616)|Araña]], attacked Julia at her home just as she was about to flee the country with her daughter. Julia was captured and summarily incarcerated. However, Julia escaped captivity during the [[Negative Zone]] prison break, and returned to [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]] in search of Rachel.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 #13}} A [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Psy Ops team telepathically traced her to [[Brooklyn]], where she furiously confronted Araña, demanding to know where her daughter had been taken.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 #14}}

===Omega Flight===
She spent some time living in [[Canada]] and working with the Canadian government as part of Canada's new superhero team [[Omega Flight (Heroes) (Earth-616)|Omega Flight]].{{r|Omega Flight Vol 1 #1|2}} She was given the option of having her outstanding charges dropped in exchange for her participation on the team.{{r|Omega Flight Vol 1 3|4}}

After a battle against the Wrecking Crew, Julia decided to stay on the team.{{r|Omega Flight Vol 1 #5}} She helped the team expose [[Elizabeth Benning (Earth-616)|Dr. Benning]] who was using her position with the Canadian government to force an addiction on the new Guardian, [[Michael Pointer (Earth-616)|Michael Pointer]], by feeding him the mutant energy of captured criminals.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 2 #3|11}} With the departure of most of Omega Flight's members, Julia eventually returned to America.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 2 #12}}

===Grim Hunt===
Julia was dragged into [[Aleksandra Nikolaevna (Earth-616)|Sasha Kravinoff]]'s Grim Hunt of Spider-Man as a means to resurrect her husband [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 634}} After the unsuccessful attempt at resurrection through the sacrifice of [[Martha Franklin (Earth-616)|Mattie Franklin]], the third woman to take the name Spider-Woman, Julia was captured by the Kravinoff family alongside Araña to be further sacrifices.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 635}} As Spider-Man put a stop to their scheme, the Kravinoffs' most important prisoner, [[Cassandra Webb (Earth-616)|Madame Web]] was mortally wounded. In her final moments, Madame Web transferred her telepathic, precognitive, and astral projection powers into Julia - making her blind, the new Madame Web, and Weaver of the Spider family.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 636}}

===Madame Web and Spider-Island===
Julia's first action in this role was to prevent Peter from killing Kraven, explaining to Peter that he was the center of a moral web that would be destroyed if he killed Kraven and advising him that this murder, however justified, would turn him into a ruthless destroyer. After burying [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]] and Madame Web in a potter's field, she explained her new purpose to Spider-Man and Araña before teleporting away. Afterwards, Julia gave her Arachne costume to Anya so she could become the newly christened Spider-Girl.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 637}}

[[File:Julia Carpenter (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 690 0001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Julia now Madame Web]]
When the population of [[Manhattan]] developed spider-powers, Julia observed the crisis with [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]], preventing him from intervening until Spider-Man was accidentally attacked by the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] when he tried to help out.

Later, as [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom]] worked on curing the individuals affected of their spider-powers, she reflected on the need for both [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Venom]] and Anti-Venom to fix the [[Spider-Island (Event)|Spider-Island]] problem. At the final battle of the Spider-Island, she soon realized that Kaine (who had been cured) was the one who was willing to kill, unlike Peter, thus seeing him as the last hope of killing the [[Adriana Soria (Earth-616)|Spider-Queen]].

After the Spider-Island events, Julia aided Spider-Man during a "race against time" mission to stop a catastrophe that could destroy the entire city. She warned him that he had to do this work by himself without the aid from either the Avengers or the [[Future Foundation (Earth-616)|Future Foundation]]. After the danger was averted, Julia congratulated Peter on his efforts.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #678|679}}

===Coma===
Shortly before [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] swapped his mind with Peter Parker's and temporarily became Spider-Man, Madame Web suffered an overload of her powers as a consequence of presaging the death of Spider-Man, witnessing every point in the future for a split second before falling into a coma. Luckily, she had previously foretold this event, for which she called for an ambulance before collapsing, and was taken to a hospital.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #695}} Julia remained in a coma for more than a year. Shortly after the [[Spider-Army (Multiverse)|Spider-Army]] defeated the [[Inheritors (Earth-001)|Inheritors]] and Otto Octavius started damaging the [[Web of Life and Destiny]] that connected all spiders, she woke up from her condition, claiming that her connection with the Web of Life and Destiny had been lost.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 15}}

Not long afterwards, Julia became the victim of stalking from her ex-boyfriend the Shroud, who set up a gigantic surveillance system in [[Alcatraz Island]] in order to find her as part of an ill-conceived attempt to fix his life.{{r|Daredevil Vol 4 15}} The Shroud managed to intercept Julia at a local airport since she was on a layover in the middle of a flight to Denver. [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] managed to stop the Shroud,{{r|Daredevil Vol 4 16}} but during a subsequent scuffle, Julia was kidnapped by henchmen sent by the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 4 17}} After Daredevil rescued Julia, she helped him set up a trap for the Shroud. On the pretense that she agreed to reunite with him, Julia met up with Max and kissed him. However, she had coated her lips with tranquilizer to knock him out so he could be apprehended by the authorities.{{r|Daredevil Vol 4 18}}

===The Clone Conspiracy===
With the emergence of a mysterious new company called [[New U Technologies (Earth-616)|New U Technologies]] in [[San Francisco]], Julia put the Shroud's surveillance system to use in order to investigate them.{{r|Prowler Vol 2 2}} Her attempts to hack into the [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Jackal]]'s company were trailed back to her, and a clone of the [[Hobie Brown (Clone) (Earth-616)|Prowler]] was sent after her.{{r|Prowler Vol 2 1}} After shutting down Julia's network, the Prowler attempted to convince her to join the Jackal's cause, but she refused and escaped.{{r|Prowler Vol 2 2}}

After escaping from an attack from the new [[Francine Frye (Earth-616)|Electro]], the Prowler was rescued by Julia. He directed her to New U's headquarters so they could retrieve the [[New U Pills|special pills]] that Prowler needed to ingest regularly to stay alive.{{r|Prowler Vol 2 3}} Julia took advantage of this visit to investigate the facility, and she stumbled into the original Madame Web, one of the many subjects New U had cloned back to life. Madam Web refused to take her pills to halt the degenerative process of her body, since she had seen the future and refused to be part of it. Before passing away, Madame Web told Julia to save the Prowler.

When all of New U's clones started degenerating as a consequence of a clone of Doctor Octopus sabotaging the Jackal's plans, the Prowler crossed paths with Julia and accused her of sabotaging the facility. After failing to convince the Prowler she was not at fault, Julia knocked him out.{{r|Prowler Vol 2 4}} Not long afterwards, the dying Prowler was again attacked by Electro. Julia found him and managed to aid him in fending off Electro, while also informing the Prowler that Spider-Man had managed to figure out a way to stabilize the massive degeneration. When Electro attempted to attack Julia, the Prowler sacrificed himself to protect her and died in her arms. In the aftermath of the crisis, Julia found the real [[Hobie Brown (Earth-616)|Hobie Brown]] in cryo-sleep, and informed him of his clone's actions.{{r|Prowler Vol 2 5}}

===Order of the Web===
[[File:ASM Vol 5 49 Order of the Web and Peter Parker Spider-Man 001.png|left|thumb|300px|Julia witnesses Peter's moment of choice]]
Julia precognition attuned her to a shared vision of Peter Parker suffering and dying by way of a disfigured and bandaged [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|demon]] with [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Miles]], [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Cindy]], [[Gwendolyn Stacy (Earth-65)|Gwen]], [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Jess]], and [[Anya Corazon (Earth-616)|Anya]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 44}} After Julia gathered and warned them that an unknown force had brought Spider-Man into conflict with [[Stanley Carter (Earth-616)|Sin-Eater]], her petition to the other spider heroes reached a consensus and they founded the [[Order of the Web (Earth-616)|Order of the Web]] to save Peter from Norman.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 48}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: The Sins of Norman Osborn Vol 1 1}}

Following Sin-Eater's momentary imprisonment, the group boarded his escape pod, but she witnessed Norman's antagonism with Peter over Gwen. As Peter uncharacteristically threw Norman out to be prey for Sin-Eater while they escaped, Julia foresaw this outcome, knowing the horror of what would come next.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 49}} Like the others, Julia was possessed by a demon sent by [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Kindred]] to destroy Spider-Man, whose sacrifice of Norman was a deal sealed with Kindred. Before the complete possession, Julia told Peter there was no avoiding the events to come.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 50}}

Under the control of Kindred, the Order began wrecking havoc across the city and even battling the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 51.LR}} Arriving at the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], they attacked innocent bystanders and were also harming themselves, forcing Peter to make a deal with the demon. Kindred accepted the deal and released the spider heroes from his control.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 52}} The confused heroes were then met by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] and [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]], as the sorcerer explained that they needed to collaborate in order to help Peter. Julia used her precognition to see the future idea Strange would have in order to expedite their plan of action, and they all ventured into the [[Astral Plane]], leaving Black Cat behind to guard their way back.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 52.LR}}

After traversing Peter's traumatized dreamscape past a horde of demons to reach a portal to Kindred's cemetery, the group was no match for Sin-Eater augmented by Morlun's powers. Seeing a victory, Julia let the villain kill and take her powers, but went mad with seeing Kindred's truth and committed suicide, reviving Julia back to normal. However, Kindred captured them{{r|{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 53.LR}}-[[Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 54.LR|54.LR]]}} and forced them into being "dinner guests" for his party. Julia's and everyone's lives were saved by [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]]'s timely petition of self-sacrifice and Norman Osborn's arrival. With Fisk's successful entrapment of Kindred, Julia and the other were allowed to escape, concluding the ordeal by going home to recuperate. But with confusion on certain facts, Julia and the others voted to continue as a group and find out what else they could about Kindred while apprehending escaped inmates.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 55|56}}

| Powers                  = 
'''Superhuman Strength:''' Julia possesses superhuman strength enabling her to lift at least 10 tons.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 11}}

'''Superhuman Speed:''' Julia is capable of running and moving at speeds considerably greater than the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 11}}

'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Julia's musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. She can physically exert herself at peak capacity for several hours before fatigue begins to impair her.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 11}}

'''Superhuman Agility:''' Julia's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 11}}

'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Julia's natural reaction time is enhanced to a level that is beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.

'''Superhuman Durability:''' The tissues of her body are somewhat harder and more resistant to injury than those of an ordinary human. While far from invulnerable, Julia is able to withstand impact forces that would severely injure or kill an ordinary human with only mild to moderate discomfort.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 11}}

'''Accelerated Healing Factor:''' If injured, Julia is able to recover from mild to moderate injuries somewhat faster and more efficiently than an ordinary human. She is capable of fully healing on her own in a matter of days that would require an ordinary human to undergo surgery. Julia is also physically immune to all known types of poisons.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 11}}

'''Superhuman Sense of Touch:''' Julia's sense of touch is developed to the point that she can sense vibration like a spider on its webs. Her senses are so sharp, that she can detect a hollow area under a solid steel floor by walking over it.

'''Psionic Powers:''' Some of Julia's spider-like abilities are the results of developed psionic capabilities rather than her physical attributes.
*'''Wall Crawling:''' She can stick to walls in a manner similar to [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], manipulating the inter-atomic binding forces of matter to create temporary but powerful molecular bonds between her body and whatever she touches.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 11}}
*'''Psionic Webbing:''' Julia can utilize psionic-based webbing (psi-webs). By using psychokinetic energy, she can bind ambient free-floating molecules into strands of solid force. Her psi-webs can be used to wrap enemies, or focused into narrow web-lines that she can swing from. Due to its psychic nature, her psi-webs can be used in ways Spider-Man's webbing never could, such as causing webs to form from a distance, or controlling the movement of her webbing mentally. She can create webs of psionic energy able to hold up to 10 tons when properly anchored.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 11}}
*'''Psionic Vibrations:''' By casting small strands of psionic webbing into her environment, Julia can feel "psychic vibrations" reverberating through them just like a spider can feel regular vibrations through their webs. This allows her to sense the presence of other people in her vicinity, pinpointing potential attackers over a distance.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #634|635}}

'''Madame Web:''' As Cassandra Webb died, she passed on her abilities as Madame Web to Julia. By inheriting this psychic power, Julia became physically blind but greatly increased her psionic abilities.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #637}}
*'''Prescience:''' Ability to perceive aspects of the future.
*'''Telepathy:''' Ability to read minds and project thoughts.
*'''Astral Projection:''' Ability to project her consciousness outside her body and travel.
*'''Possible Teleportation:''' Since becoming the new Madame Web, Julia has seemingly teleported from one location to another. This is not an ability previously demonstrated by either her or the first Madame Web. It is possible Julia is not actually teleporting, but rather projecting a very vivid astral projection to a secondary location. This appeared to be the case in at least one instance where she suddenly appeared.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #671}}
