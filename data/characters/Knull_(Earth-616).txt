| Overview = '''Knull''' is a eldritch god of darkness and the creator of the symbiotes. He is the main antagonist of [[Venom Vol 4|''Venom'' Vol. 4]] and the [[King in Black (Event)|King in Black]] event.

Born from [[Ginnungagap|the primordial void]] that existed between [[Sixth Cosmos (Multiverse)|the sixth]] and [[Glossary:Seventh Cosmos|seventh cosmos]],{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} Knull claims dominion over the void and to be its avatar, but while he is a God of the Void he is not [[Oblivion (Earth-616)|the primordial darkness]] itself.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 4}} Awakened by [[Glossary:Enigma Force|the Light]] when the [[Celestials]] invaded his kingdom of darkness, he created [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|the first symbiote]] in the form of [[Glossary:Necrosword|a sword]] and decapitated [[Headless Celestial (Earth-616)|a Celestial]]. He used [[Knowhere|the head]]'s divine power to refine the blade, creating a metaphysical connection between the primordial symbiote and the slain cosmic god - which would be the source of most of Knull's tremendous power.{{r|King in Black: Return of the Valkyries Vol 1 2}} Waging war against the Light, Knull became a legendary figure of divine terror but eventually found himself stranded on a [[Gorr's Homeworld|nameless planet]] after [[Gorr (God Butcher) (Earth-616)|an inhabitant]] stole his blade and unwittingly followed in his footsteps. Experimenting with his powers, Knull discovered he could create amorphous parasites from the darkness he controls and merge them with "lesser creatures", so he decided to use this as a way to corrupt the Light.

Establishing himself as the nexus of [[Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)|the Hive]] he created, Knull proceeded to conquer worlds and form a fleet of [[Symbiote Dragons]]. When two of his dragons arrived on [[Earth]], the young God of Thunder [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor Odinson]] struck down [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|one]] of them and severed Knull's connection to all of the other Symbiote Dragons, who dissipated into countless individual symbiotes, while [[Big Mother (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|the other]] would seemingly be killed by Thor in a mid-air battle, its body plummeting to the depths of the [[North Sea]]. Merging with the closest hosts they could find, the Hive was now infected with concepts of honor and nobility, so the symbiotes turned on Knull and trapped him at the core of [[Klyntar (Location)|the throneworld]], rebranding themselves [[Symbiotes (Race)|Symbiote]] out of their word for "cage".{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}}{{r|Scream: Curse of Carnage Vol 1 5}}

Later freed by [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]] when he merged with [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|an offshoot]] of the Grendel, Knull would eventually arrive on Earth and come face-to-face with [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]], who was the host of the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]]. Initially gaining the upper hand against  Earth's heroes and even killing Eddie, Knull's victory was undermined when Eddie's son [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan Brock]], who was born with symbiote powers, severed Knull's connection to the symbiotes. Suffering from many counterattacks, Knull was killed when Eddie was revived by the [[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|God of Light]] and disintegrated him in the core of the sun.{{r|{{cl|King in Black Vol 1 1}}-[[King in Black Vol 1 5|5]]}}

| History                 = 
===Origins===
[[File:King in Black Vol 1 1 Jeehyung.com Exclusive Virgin Variant.jpg|thumb|left|King in Black]]
Knull was an ancient malevolent deity who purportedly ruled over [[Ginnungagap|the Abyss]], the existential chasm that existed between the destruction of the [[Sixth Cosmos (Multiverse)|Sixth Cosmos]] and the creation of the [[Glossary:Seventh Cosmos|Seventh Cosmos]],{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} though in truth he was merely an avatar of [[Oblivion (Earth-616)|the primordial darkness]] that existed long before even him.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 4}} Originally content to slumber in the Void, Knull was awakened by the "[[Glossary:Enigma Force|Light of the Creation]]" when the [[Celestials]] began creating the universe, and was outraged at his kingdom of darkness being despoiled. Knull retaliated by creating a [[Glossary:Necrosword|sword of living darkness]], the [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|All-Black]], from his newly-cast shadow, decapitating [[Headless Celestial (Earth-616)|one of them]]. Cast back into the void by the other Celestials, Knull used [[Knowhere|the slain Celestial's severed head]] as a forge to temper his sword in its cosmic energies. Intent on devouring the divine light that had usurped his kingdom of darkness, Knull manifested [[Knull's Symbiote (Earth-616)|a symbiotic suit of armor]] from the eldritch darkness he commanded and embarked on a genocidal campaign against the other gods and life itself,{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} becoming a legendary figure of terror for divine beings even billions of years later.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder Vol 1 6}} 

===Symbiote Hive===
====Reign of Terror====
[[File:Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 4 3 001.png|thumb|right|God-Host of the Symbiote Hive.]]
Hellbent on returning the cosmos to the Abyss, Knull created [[Klyntar (Location)|an artificial planet]] from the living darkness he controlled to serve as his throneworld and base of operations.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}} Experimenting with his ability to manifest life out of darkness itself, Knull began using the Exoteric Latitude as a dumping ground for his failed creations, which millennia later became known as the [[Exolon]].{{r|Web of Venom: Wraith Vol 1 1}} Among his early creations were proto-symbiotes such as [[Mister E (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Mister E]] - and presumably the other shadow realm entities like [[Shadow Man (Earth-616)|Shadow Man]] and [[Kaa (Earth-616)|Kaa]],{{r|{{cl|Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 1}}-[[Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 5|5]]}} as well as a horde of [[Symbiote Dragons|wyvern-like monsters]]. Establishing himself as the divine nexus of the abyssal entities' hive-mind, Knull sent them forth into the cosmos -- using them to conquer countless planets, devour civilizations and pantheons,{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 2}}-[[Venom Vol 4|4]]}}{{r|Scream: Curse of Carnage Vol 1 2}} extinguish stars, and smother entire planets in eldritch darkness. <!--''King in Black'' #1 states that Knull created the symbiote dragons roughly 100 000 years ago and the symbiotes no more than 3000 years ago, but this is contradicted by ''Venom'' #3 and #4, ''Silver Surfer: Black'' #2 and #5, and ''Scream: Curse of Carnage'' #2.--> The few gods that Knull spared were forcibly drafted into [[Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)|his army]], enslaved to his will and transformed into monsters using the living abyss, placed as [[Knull's Sentries (Earth-616)|sentries]] to guard the worlds he'd conquered.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1143637677956378624|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: "No yeah, that’s the necrosword. Why wouldn’t it be?"|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=25 June 2019|accessdate=25 June 2019}}}} 

At some point during Knull's war against the Light, he encountered the time-displaced [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] when the former Herald of [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] freed a world from Knull's control using the [[Power Cosmic]].{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}} After a brief but intense fight, Knull defeated the Silver Surfer and infected him with living abyss to turn him into the [[Void Knight (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Void Knight]]. However, the Silver Surfer was freed by [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego the Living Planet]], who helped Radd escape when Knull pursued him on a symbiote dragon.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}} Knull hunted the Silver Surfer down and dueled him, intent on reclaiming him for his army. Knull nearly succeeded in doing so, but was defeated when the Silver Surfer expended the last of his Power Cosmic to conjure a star right in front of him, bathing him in stellar plasma and blasting him across the cosmos. This defeat proved temporary, as Knull recovered and resumed his conquest of the cosmos.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 5}}
[[File:Knull (Earth-616), All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616), Symbiote Dragons (Earth-616), and Norrin Radd (Earth-616) from Silver Surfer Black Vol 1 5 003.jpg|thumb|left|Knull's original symbiote-armor.]]
At some point afterward, Knull engaged an army of gold-armored gods empowered by the Light in combat and slaughtered all but one of them. Pursuing the survivor, Knull managed to impale him on All-Black but was himself impaled through the head by the enemy god's spear. Knull and the dying god crash-landed on [[Gorr's Homeworld|a desolate planet]], where All-Black left the incapacitated Knull for one of the indigenous inhabitants, [[Gorr (God Butcher) (Earth-616)|Gorr]].{{r|Thor: God of Thunder Vol 1 6}}{{r|King in Black Vol 1 4}} Despite this setback, Knull chose to not hunt the thief down and reclaim All-Black, though he remained aware of Gorr unwittingly following in his footsteps as the God Butcher.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} After recovering from his injuries over the course of a century, Knull began experimenting with his powers and discovered that he could manifest amorphous parasites called [[Symbiotes (Race)|symbiotes]] from the Living Abyss and bond them to lesser lifeforms, corrupting life rather than eradicating it.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 3}}{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}}<ref>''Silver Surfer: Black'' shows Knull having already created his horde prior to losing All-Black, and various issues state this to have occurred several billion to only 3000 years ago, leaving the exact timeline of these events unclear.</ref>

====Downfall====
Knull's reign of terror came to an end in the sixth century CE, when two symbiote dragons - one black and one red - arrived on [[Earth]] and were named the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]] and [[Big Mother (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel's Mother]] by the [[Denmark|Danes]].{{r|Scream: Curse of Carnage Vol 1 2}}{{r|Venom Vol 4 1}} The Grendel's rampage was stopped by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], who blasted it with divine lightning and severed Knull's connection to the vast majority of symbiotes. As the symbiotes bonded to benevolent hosts, the hive-mind became tainted with notions of honor and nobility, leading to them rebelling against their god and imprisoning him at the heart of the throneworld, which they renamed [[Klyntar (Location)|Klyntar]] - their word for "cage". Forming an organization known as the [[Agents of the Cosmos (Earth-616)|Agents of the Cosmos]], the symbiotes of Klyntar subsequently attempted to expunge their dark origins and redeem themselves by acting to protect the cosmos they'd once terrorized.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}}{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 23}}

While serving as a [[Heralds of Galactus (Earth-616)|herald]] of [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]], the Silver Surfer came across Klyntar and was devoured by it, its constituent symbiotes attempting to imprison him alongside Knull at the artificial planet's core. However, the Surfer was able to free himself and escape.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}}

===Modern Times===
====Awakening====
[[File:Knull (Earth-616), Miles Morales (Earth-1610), Edward Brock (Earth-616) and Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 4 3 001.jpg|thumb|right|Knull's avatar confronts Spider-Man and Venom.]]
Centuries later, the Grendel symbiote dragon was unearthed by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and its living abyss was used to create a super-soldier initiative called the [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|Sym-Soldier Program]].{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam Vol 1 1}} Using the psychic link between himself and the Grendel, Knull began attempting to assert his influence over its offshoots, causing them to rampage and driving their hosts insane.{{r|Venom Vol 3 3}}{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam Vol 1 1}} 

Decades later, Knull remote-piloted the symbiote dragon and broke it free of containment, reabsorbing four of its five offshoots. Knull sent the Grendel symbiote dragon on a rampage through downtown [[Manhattan]], but it was stopped by the combined efforts of [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]] - whose [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|symbiote]] had been adversely affected by Knull's awakening - and [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 1|2}} Using the Grendel to manifest an avatar of his true form, Knull stripped the Venom symbiote from its host and attempted to purge it of the benevolence and compassion it had obtained during its time on Earth; intending to reconnect it to his hive mind and absorb it into the Grendel symbiote to become stronger.{{r|Venom Vol 4 3}} When confronted by Eddie Brock, Knull showed him the true origins and history of the symbiotes; mocking him for believing the lies told to the Venom symbiote by the Symbiotes and Agents of the Cosmos. Re-forming the Grendel around his avatar, Eddie, and Spider-Man; Knull flew into space and revealed his plan to obtain the missing pieces of the symbiote dragon, use it to free his true body from Klyntar, and resume his conquest of the universe - starting with Earth.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}}

Venom escaped with help from Spider-Man, but Knull chose not to pursue them and instead began hunting for the [[Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Tyrannosaurus symbiote]] - one of the remaining pieces of the Grendel symbiote dragon. When the Tyrannosaurus symbiote bonded to Venom and reconnected to the Hive Mind, Knull attacked using the Grendel symbiote and attempted to devour Venom. When the Grendel was destabilized by sonic grenades, Knull's manifestation engaged Venom in a brutal one-on-one battle, Venom's arsenal of high-tech weapons proving ineffective. Knull stripped Eddie of both symbiotes and began absorbing them, but his gloating was cut short when Eddie detonated the entire arsenal - the blast affecting Knull's real body at the core of Klyntar. Shaken and enraged, Knull coated his manifestation in the Grendel symbiote, but before he could attack the Tyrannosaurus symbiote coiled around his avatar and dragged it into the heart of a blast furnace - telling Venom to hold the door shut. Knull's avatar was subsequently immolated, his connection to the Grendel symbiote seemingly severed and his body remaining sealed at the heart of Klyntar.{{r|Venom Vol 4 6}}

====Freed by Carnage====
A few months after the battle, an [[Cult of Knull (Earth-616)|Earth-based cult]] dedicated to worshiping Knull - led by [[Tanis Nieves (Earth-616)|Scorn]] - obtained [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a sample of the Grendel symbiote]] and Cletus Kasady's corpse, intending to turn him into Knull's avatar and facilitate his awakening. When the sample of Grendel symbiote was bonded to Cletus, Knull reanimated and psychically communicated with the serial killer; though the nature of their conversation is unknown. When Knull attempted to seize control of Cletus through the symbiote, Cletus resisted Knull's control and their connection was severed when the Grendel symbiote absorbed the codex - trace remnants of living abyss left in former symbiote hosts - that the [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage symbiote]] had left in Scorn's body. Cletus desired to communicate with Knull again and decided to help free him by collecting enough codices to reconnect the Grendel symbiote to the Hive Mind.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} As his connection to his self-proclaimed apostle grew stronger, Knull began awakening and exerting his influence to corrupt both the symbiotes of Klyntar and those stranded on Earth -- namely the [[Riot (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Riot]], [[Agony (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Agony]], [[Phage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Phage]], [[Lasher (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Lasher]], and [[Scream (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Scream]] symbiotes.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Separation Anxiety Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage: Scream Vol 1 1}}{{r|Venom Vol 4 18}}

[[File:Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616), Knull (Earth-616), and Klyntar (Location) from Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|left|Freed from Klyntar.]]
After Dark Carnage was killed by Venom, who absorbed the Dark Carnage symbiote and [[Venom III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|remaining codices]], Knull was reawakened and promptly destroyed Klyntar, coalescing its constituent symbiotes into a fleet of symbiote dragons. Manifesting his suit of draconic armor, Knull was confronted by [[Zak-Del (Earth-616)|Zak-Del]], an Exolon-infected [[Kree]]. Initially bemused by Zak-Del accusing him of stealing his soul, Knull revealed the true origin of the Exolon as imperfect symbiotes and stripped Zak-Del of his, absorbing it into his armor before manifesting All-Black's Necrosword form anew.{{r|Web of Venom: Wraith Vol 1 1}} Leaving Zak-Del for dead, Knull resumed his conquest of the cosmos; unknowingly hunted by his opposite - the God of Light.{{r|Web of Venom: Wraith Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5}} 

[[File:Knull (Earth-616) and Symbiote Dragons (Earth-616) from Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|right|Conquest resumed.]]
Using his living abyss to smother entire planets,{{r|Incoming Vol 1 1}} Knull also began communing with Eddie's "son" [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan Brock]] - a human-symbiote hybrid spawned by the Venom symbiote - by appearing in his nightmares.{{r|Venom Vol 4 22}}{{r|Web of Venom: The Good Son Vol 1 1}}<!--After several days, Knull managed to corrupt Dylan into his acolyte.{{r|Web of Venom: The Good Son Vol 1 1}} - The events of ''Venom: Island'' contradict those of ''Web of Venom: The Good Son'', leaving the latter's canonicity ambiguous.--> Blazing a swath of destruction across the [[Kree/Skrull Alliance (Earth-616)|Kree/Skrull Alliance]]'s colonial territories en route to Earth, Knull laid traps to waylay ships sent to investigate; thereby claiming several prominent warriors from both species for his army.{{r|Web of Venom: Empyre's End Vol 1 1}} Intent on settling his eons-old grudge against the Celestials, Knull hunted them down and infected them with living abyss.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} Knull also sent symbiotes and symbiote-dragons to blaze a swath of destruction across numerous other spacefaring civilizations such as the [[Zn'rx]].{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 3}}

====[[King in Black (Event)|Invasion of Earth]]====
[[File:Web of Venom Empyre's End Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
Arriving at Earth, Knull and his horde easily ploughed through the minefield of derelict Kree and Skrull ships left over from the war against the [[Cotati]]. As his dragons rained down on the Earth and quickly overwhelmed the planet's superheroes, Knull emerged from one of the Celestials and declared his intent to destroy the planet - offering to make it quick and painless if given the human called Brock. Knull was attacked by the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]], who attempted to fly him into orbit and rip him in half, but easily broke free and reversed their positions. Knull tore the Sentry apart and seized control of the [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|dark entity]] that had been indwelling him, absorbing it into himself. Growing bored of the conflict, Knull used symbiotes to seize control of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], and many of the other heroes that had rallied to oppose him before encasing the Earth in a shell of living abyss. Out of desperation, Venom offered to serve Knull if Earth was spared, but Knull refused - remarking that the Brock he was interested in was Dylan - and ripped the Venom symbiote off Eddie before throwing him from the top of the Empire State Building,{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} satisfied that Eddie could no longer prove a pest to his plans once he succumbed to his wounds and his consciousness was trapped within the Hive-Mind as a codex.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 2}}{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 31}}-[[Venom Vol 4 32|32]]}} 

[[File: Knull (Earth-616) and Knull's Symbiote (Earth-616) from King in Black Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|right|Arrival on Earth.]]
Constructing a lair at the tip of the Empire State Building, Knull began directing his invasion on multiple fronts by remote-piloting symbiote-dragons, indwelling symbiote-possessed heroes, and manifesting avatars.{{r|King in Black: Black Knight Vol 1 1}}{{r|King in Black: Gwenom vs. Carnage Vol 1 1}}{{r|King in Black: Planet of the Symbiotes Vol 1 1}}{{r|King in Black: Scream Vol 1 1}}{{r|King in Black: Return of the Valkyries Vol 1 2}}{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1}} Knull attempted to claim the [[Ebony Blade]], [[Sword of Fu Xi]], and [[Gwendolyn Stacy (Earth-65)|Ghost-Spider]]'s [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-65)|artificial symbiote]] for himself; but was thwarted and repeatedly taken aback by the number of heroes who possessed powers and weapons able to kill his dragons and damage - if not outright destroy - his avatars, as well as the willpower to partially resist his control.{{r|King in Black: Black Knight Vol 1 1}}{{r|Daredevil Vol 6 27}}{{r|King in Black: Scream Vol 1 1}}{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 3}} Reaching backwards through [[Glossary:Timestream|time]], Knull resurrected Mister E and sent him to either destroy the Ebony Blade or use it facilitate his premature escape from Klyntar;{{r|Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 1}} though Mister E repeatedly failed to do so and was ultimately destroyed.{{r|Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 5}} Knull was stripped of the majority of his power by the [[Valkyrior (Earth-616)|Valkyries]], who severed his unwitting connection to the Headless Celestial from the [[Realm Between|afterlife]].{{r|King in Black: Return of the Valkyries Vol 1 4}}

When Dylan Brock entered the battlefield and began using his powers to free the people and heroes Knull had enslaved, Knull attempted to capture him but was attacked by Thor - who he recognized as the one who had almost killed the Grendel centuries prior. Furious, Knull confronted the God of Thunder, who was unimpressed and dismissed him as merely one of hundreds of gods of destruction he had vanquished. Knull overpowered Thor, but was attacked by Dylan. Casually subduing the boy and cocooning him in living abyss, Knull was distracted long enough for Thor to knock him off and rip his lower jaw off with a full-power blow from [[Mjolnir]]. Enraged, Knull activated the symbiote-controlled Celestials and ordered them to raze the planet. Before Thor could leave to confront them, Knull - forming a new lower jaw from living abyss - manifested a Necrosword from his symbiote-armor and impaled him from behind; sneering that he could sense Thor was already acquainted with All-Black and that he was its creator. Leaving Thor impaled, Knull turned to confront Dylan and voiced his intent to claim the boy as his son;{{r|King in Black Vol 1 3}} commanding the symbiotes he controlled within the Hive-Mind to imprison the symbiotes that Dylan and Thor had purged his influence from.{{r|Venom Vol 4 33}} Unbeknowst to Knull, Eddie Brock was reunited with the codices of [[Anti-Venom II (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Agent Anti-Venom]] ([[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Flash Thompson]]) and Tyrannosaurus ([[Rex Strickland (Earth-616)|Rex Strickland]]) within the Hive-Mind,{{r|Venom Vol 4 32}} and were able to take advantage of Dylan and Thor injuring Knull to infiltrate the core of the Hive-Mind, the God Hive. When Agent Anti-Venom's codex bonded to one of the symbiotes that Knull couldn't control and was reborn into the world of the living as a white symbiote dragon, Knull immediately realized what was going on and furiously hijacked the Tyrannosaurus symbiote, confronting Eddie again with the intent of killing him once-and-for-all.{{r|Venom Vol 4 33}} However, Eddie managed to escape the Hive-Mind with help from the Venom symbiote and was chosen as the God of Light's new host.{{r|Venom Vol 4 34}}

Confronted by the Silver Surfer once more, Knull prepared to resume their ancient duel but was interrupted by Eddie, now transformed into a cosmic version of Venom. Knull attempted to flee while throwing everything he had at Eddie, but was cornered at the top of the Empire State Building, stripped of his symbiote-armor, and thrown to the ground. Knull defiantly told Eddie that his death was inconsequential and that the Void's victory was inevitable, but Eddie rebuked Knull and flew him into the Sun, destroying his body with the Uni-Power. Knull attempted to take over Dylan Brock's body, but Eddie used the Uni-Power to remove the living abyss from Dylan and destroy it, seemingly defeating the dark god once-and-for-all.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 5}}

I see why [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|my child]] adores you so. But you have been lied to for so very long.

An ancient malevolent deity, Knull despises the [[Celestials]] and their creations, attempting to carry out a genocide against them by corrupting and slaughtering all life. Revelling in bloodshed and destruction, Knull often sports a predatory grin when engaged in combat and fondly reminisced to Eddie Brock about the devastation he and All-Black wrought together. He is also arrogant and sadistic - regarding his conquest of the universe as being inevitable, mocking the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]]'s attempt to fight him or escape as futile, and relishing the prospect of hunting the fleeing Surfer down and killing or corrupting him.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}} Knull's hubris is one of his greatest weaknesses, as he routinely underestimates opponents he sees as beneath himself - such as the Silver Surfer, Venom, and Thor - and rarely fights using the full extent of his own power, instead opting to let his symbiotes do the fighting for him.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}}{{r|King in Black Vol 1 3}}

Through his symbiote army, Knull is responsible for the destruction and corruption of entire civilizations across the universe. When not engaged in combat, Knull appeared calm and condescending, often smiling in a sadistic fashion at sights such as Venom's berserk form, which he called beautiful. However, Knull possesses a volatile temper and is prone to reacting with extreme rage when denied what he wants, such as when Eddie tried to stop him from re-corrupting the Venom symbiote or when the Silver Surfer refused to serve him.{{r|Venom Vol 4 3}}{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 5}} Knull was begrudgingly impressed by Eddie's determination to understand the eldritch truth behind the symbiotes' origins, but mocked him for being deceived by the Symbiotes hive-mind. He considers the symbiotes who rebelled against and imprisoned him to be cowards, liars, and traitors; sneering at their desperate efforts to cover up their dark origins and keep themselves from relapsing. Despite his loathing respect for them - seeing them as his wayward children - he hates the Symbiotes symbiotes for betraying him and eventually forcibly absorbed them back into his dark hive-mind.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}}

| Powers                  = '''Divine Physiology:''' As a primordial god of darkness and avatar of Oblivion, Knull possesses superhuman attributes and powers far exceeding those of humans and even most other deities. As the creator of [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|All-Black the Necrosword]], he apparently possesses the same powers it bestows upon its hosts but to a greater extent.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder Vol 1 6}}{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}}{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}} According to [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Brunnhilde]], much of Knull's power and apparent invincibility comes from his metaphysical link to the undead corpse of the Celestial he used to refine All-Black, which feeds him power through the Necrosword and in exchange assimilates the souls of those he kills; serving as a grotesque afterlife.{{r|King in Black: Return of the Valkyries Vol 1 2}} This connection was severed by the [[Valkyrior (Earth-616)|Valkyries]], thereby greatly weakening Knull,{{r|King in Black: Return of the Valkyries Vol 1 4}} though he still remained powerful enough to fight on-par with the likes of All-Father Thor and overpower him.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 4}}
*'''Living Abyss Manipulation:''' Knull possesses the ability to create, control, and manipulate a fount of eldritch darkness—a manifestation of [[Oblivion (Earth-616)|the primordial void]] that existed before the universe itself—that he calls the "[[Glossary:Living Abyss|living abyss]]".{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} Knull has spent billions of years experimenting with and honing his powers to create not only the [[Symbiotes (Race)|parasitic symbiotes]], but similar entities such as [[Mister E (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Mister E]] and the [[Exolon]]. His greatest creations have been [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|All-Black]], the [[Void Knight (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Void Knight]] -- a powerful proto-symbiote created to enslave the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]], and the [[Symbiote Dragons|symbiote dragons]].{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} During his invasion of Earth, Knull was able to engulf the entire Earth in a dome of living abyss, blocking out all light.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}}
** '''Symbiote Creation:''' Knull first discovered his ability to create life from darkness itself when he manifested [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|All-Black]] from his shadow in order to kill a Celestial. Experimenting with and honing this aspect of his powers over the eons, he formed [[Knull's Symbiote (Earth-616)|a suit of symbiote-armor]], constructed an [[Klyntar (Location)|artificial planet]], and amassed a horde of [[Symbiote Dragons|wyvern-like monsters]] from the living abyss.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}}{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} While he initially only infected gods and other cosmic beings with the living abyss;{{r|{{cl|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}}-[[Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2|2]]}} when stranded on [[Gorr's Homeworld|a desolate world]] he discovered he could also infect mortal creatures with the living abyss, creating an army of parasites to conquer the universe by corrupting life instead of simply exterminating it.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}}{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} Knull's early experiments to hone this aspect of his powers resulted in what became known as the [[Exolon]], imperfect symbiotes he discarded as failures.{{r|Web of Venom: Wraith Vol 1 1}} He was also capable of creating symbiotes using his blood, though the only known symbiote created in this manner is [[Big Mother (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Big Mother]].{{r|Scream: Curse of Carnage Vol 1 2}}
** '''Symbiote Domination:''' As the divine progenitor of the symbiotes and the nexus of their hive-mind, Knull is able to mentally influence and dominate symbiotes even while sealed away;{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} driving them insane with bloodlust and hunger.{{r|Venom Vol 4 1|2}} He is also capable of remote-piloting them, enabling him to see through their eyes and directly control them; and can manipulate their biomasses even when not in direct contact with them, as demonstrated when he used an ancient dragon-like symbiote to attack Earth and manifest an avatar of his true form.{{r|Venom Vol 4 3}} Symbiotes infected by Knull's will usually have red spirals in place of their eyespots, and are more powerful than symbiotes disconnected from his dark hive-mind; sometimes even gaining new powers and abilities as a result of the connection.{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1108591764221370368|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: "New powers from contact with Knull."|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=20 March 2019|accessdate=26 July 2019}}}}{{r|{{cite web|url=http://stegmanandfriends.podbean.com|title=VENOM BOIZ! w/Donny Cates: Venom #1 Q and A|work=PodBean|first= Ryan Stegman|last= Griffin Sheridan|date=29 June 2019|accessdate=2 July 2019}}}} Knull is also capable of forcibly removing symbiotes from their hosts either by psychically blasting them off or by ripping them off with his bare hands.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}}{{r|Web of Venom: Wraith Vol 1 1}} He is also capable of dominating other dark entities, such as the [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|Void]].{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}}
*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Knull is strong enough to decapitate a Celestial with a single blow, and singlehandedly slaughtered entire armies of gods augmented by the [[Glossary:Enigma Force|Uni-Power]]. At least some of Knull's immense strength is due to him wielding [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|All-Black the Necrosword]] and his [[Knull's Symbiote (Earth-616)|symbiote-armor]],{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} which supply him with power from the [[Headless Celestial (Earth-616)|first Celestial he'd killed]].{{r|King in Black: Return of the Valkyries Vol 1 2}} Knull was able to easily manhandle the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] - albeit after Norrin had exhausted the majority of his [[Power Cosmic]],{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}} and easily overpowered the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] - touted as one of Earth's strongest heroes - and effortlessly tore him in half.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} Even after the Valkyries severed his metaphysical connection to the [[Headless Celestial (Earth-616)|Headless Celestial]], Knull was still strong enough to overpower [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor Odinson]] - who possessed the [[Glossary:Odin-Force|Power of the All-Father]] - with relative ease.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 3}} The avatars that Knull creates using his symbiotes possess only a fraction of his true power, but are nevertheless able to easily overpower the likes of Venom despite Eddie Brock being simultaneously bonded to both the Venom and Tyrannosaurus symbiotes.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1140152131464380416|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: "Haha. Yeah! WAY more powerful. Dude severed the head of a celestial. Knull is no joke."|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=19 June 2019|accessdate=20 June 2019}}}} 
*'''Superhuman Durability:''' Knull is durable enough to survive being blasted by Celestials; and was unharmed by a plunge from space through the atmosphere of a planet while engaged in combat with another deity, though he was left unconscious after being stabbed through the head.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder Vol 1 6}} While [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]]'s [[Power Cosmic]] was able to make Knull bleed and being blasted by [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego]]'s psionic beams caused him pain, he was not severely injured by either.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}} Knull can also withstand being immersed in stellar plasma without permanent injury, though this caused him severe pain.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 5}} There are limits to this, as a full-force blow from [[Mjolnir]] wielded by All-Father Thor was enough to rip off Knull's lower jaw.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 3}}
*'''Dark Energy Manipulation:''' Knull was capable of conjuring fiery purple energy; wreathing himself and [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|All-Black]] in an aura of it, firing it from his hands in a beam powerful enough to incapacitate the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]], or firing it as flak and homing projectiles from artillery constructs manifested from the [[Klyntar (Location)|Symbiote Throneworld]].{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}} He has also been shown to manifest red energy that he can fire from his hands.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 2}}
*'''Amortality:''' Knull is purportedly unable to be truly killed and has existed for over 13.7 billion years, having come into existence prior to the beginning of the seventh iteration of the universe.{{r|Venom Vol 4 10}}{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1120132305777983489|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: "Nothing can kill Knull. #GodIsComing"|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=21 April 2019|accessdate=22 April 2019}}}} However, he can be injured to the point of incapacitation: after being impaled through the head and falling from space to the surface of a planet, he required centuries to fully heal from his injuries.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} Even after his body was completely disintegrated by Eddie Brock using the [[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|God of Light]]'s power, Knull attempted to take over Dylan Brock before being foiled by Eddie and seemingly destroyed once-and-for-all. Despite this, however, he can not truly die as he is an avatar of [[Oblivion]].{{r|King in Black Vol 1 5}}
*'''Self-Sustenance:''' Knull is capable of surviving in the vacuum of space unaided, and does not appear to need food, water, or sleep to survive.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}}
*'''Shapeshifting:''' Knull is capable of transforming his mouth into a fanged maw with a prehensile serpentine tongue, a trait he passed down to the symbiotes.{{r|Venom Vol 4 3}} When truly enraged, Knull's entire face transforms into one more closely resembling the symbiotes', with his nose, lips, and cheeks completely receding.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 5}}
*'''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Despite his immense durability, Knull is capable of being injured to the point of incapacitation.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder Vol 1 6}} However, he is able to not only survive injuries that would kill other gods, but eventually recover from them.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} After Thor blasted a hole in his hand, Knull regenerated within the space of a few seconds, though the loss of his lower jaw required the creation of a prosthesis.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 3}}
*'''Flight:''' Knull can manifest a pair of large dragon-like wings that allow him to fly.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}}
*'''Temporal Manipulation:''' Knull was able to reach backwards through the [[Glossary:Timestream|timestream]] to resurrect [[Mister E (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Mister E]] and create a barrier of living abyss around the sun;{{r|Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 1}} also communicating through time with Mister E and restoring his full power in a bid to prematurely free his past self from Klyntar using the Ebony Blade. Knull's past self was able to sense the barrier being destroyed, briefly rousing him from his imprisoned slumber.{{r|Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 5}}
| Abilities               = '''Expert Combatant:''' Despite not possessing any formal training, Knull is a vicious warrior with billions of years' worth of combat experience, capable of slaughtering entire armies of gods augmented by the [[Glossary:Enigma Force|Uni-Power]] singlehandedly.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}}
| Strength                = 
| Weaknesses              = * '''The Light:''' Despite his immense durability, Knull is particularly vulnerable to [[Glossary:Enigma Force|a force]] he refers to as "the Light", which came into being with the [[Glossary:Big Bang|Big Bang]] and was first spread through the Abyss by the [[Celestials]]. "The Light" refers not only to the literal light of stars and other celestial objects, but to the various powers wielded by [[Cosmic Beings|cosmic entities]] and [[Gods of Earth|deities]] - which when used offensively could cause him pain and even injure him;{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} concepts such as honor, benevolence, compassion, and nobility - which disrupted his control of the symbiotes and caused them to turn on him; and life itself.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}}{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}} Knull sought to destroy and corrupt the Light using his army of symbiotes, but his control over them was severed when [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|the symbiote dragon]] he was indwelling was blasted by Thor's divine lightning. Centuries later, his avatar was temporarily destabilized by the [[Spider-Totems|totemic avatar]] Miles Morales' bioelectric Venom Blast,{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 3}}-[[Venom Vol 4 4|4]]}} and by sonic and energy grenades.{{r|Venom Vol 4 6}}
* '''Remote Piloting:''' When Knull is remote piloting a symbiote, any damage caused to it is also inflicted on him -- as seen when Thor blasted a hole through a symbiote-hand Knull had manifested to attack Dylan Brock, which caused a corresponding wound to appear on Knull's hand until he regenerated.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 3}}
* '''Hive-Mind Infiltration:''' When a person or a metaphysical manifestation of a codex has freedom in Knull's hive-mind, they can fight against the symbiotes under his control and also cause him pain if not taken care of.{{r|Venom Vol 4 33}}
<!--* '''[[Anti-Venom (Symbiote)|Anti-Venom]]:''' It has been shown that Anti-Venom brings him pain, just like his symbiote children.{{r|Venom Vol 4 33}}-->
* '''Celestial Connection:''' Most of Knull's overwhelming power is supplied through the All-Black symbiote by the [[Headless Celestial (Earth-616)|Headless Celestial]], whose corpse he had used as a forge to create his [[Glossary:Necrosword|Necrosword]].{{r|King in Black: Return of the Valkyries Vol 1 2}} Knull remained oblivious to this until the moment the connection was severed by the [[Valkyrior (Earth-616)|Valkyries]], thereby depriving him of the majority of his power.{{r|King in Black: Return of the Valkyries Vol 1 4}} Despite this, Knull was still strong enough to overpower [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor Odinson]] - who had been augmented by the [[Glossary:Odin-Force|Power of the All-Father]] - in combat with relative ease.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 3}}

| Equipment               = '''Symbiote Armor:''' After forging All-Black, Knull created [[Knull's Symbiote (Earth-616)|a suit of symbiote-armor]] from the Living Abyss. The armor was originally solid black, but after he founded the [[Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)|Symbiote Imperium]] he emblazoned its chest and back with a red dragon emblem.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} It is unknown exactly what abilities the armor possessed and conferred upon Knull, though it was capable of shapeshifting to manifest a cape, waistcloth, wing-like fins, and draconic helmet.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 5}} Given that its constituent matter was used to create the lesser symbiotes, it can be presumed to possess similar abilities; and despite presumably being vulnerable to intense heat and sonics it was capable of withstanding a plunge through the atmosphere of a planet and being immersed in stellar plasma without sustaining significant damage. Knull's symbiote armor was stripped from him following his imprisonment, as his physical body at the core of Klyntar has alternately been shown armored and naked;{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}}{{r|Venom Vol 4 6}} though Knull's manifestation through the Grendel symbiote dragon also emulated this armor.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} After Knull reawakened, he reformed his symbiote-armor, with a differently-shaped helmet adorned with horns.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5}}

| Transportation          = In addition to using symbiote dragons as mounts,{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}}{{r|Web of Venom: Empyre's End Vol 1 1}} Knull is capable of manifesting draconic wings from his symbiote.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}}
| Weapons                 = '''[[Glossary:Necrosword|Necrosword]]:''' In order to slay a Celestial, Knull manifested a black-and-red sword from his shadow; later refining it using the dead Celestial's cosmic power.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} Using this weapon, which came to be known as [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|All-Black]], Knull attempted to carry out a genocide against his fellow gods, but it was stolen from him after he was wounded in battle.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder Vol 1 6}} When confronted by [[Zak-Del (Earth-616)|Wraith]], Knull removed Zak-Del's [[Exolon]] symbiote and absorbed it into his symbiote-armor before reforming All-Black's Necrosword form.{{r|Web of Venom: Wraith Vol 1 1}}{{r|{{cl|King in Black Vol 1 3}}-[[King in Black Vol 1 4|4]]}}{{r|King in Black: Return of the Valkyries Vol 1 2}}

| Notes                   = * According to Donny Cates, ''[[Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1|Silver Surfer: Black]]'' takes place before Knull lost All-Black. However, during his battle against the Silver Surfer, Knull summoned his symbiotes to aid him, which contradicts elements of his story, since {{cl|Venom Vol 4 4}} established that Knull created the symbiotes after losing All-Black.
* Knull's spiral emblem is based on the Spiral of Carcosa from ''[[Wikipedia:True Detective|True Detective]]'', and is a reference to the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].{{r|{{cite web|url=http://stegmanandfriends.podbean.com|title=VENOM BOIZ! w/Donny Cates: Venom (2018) #1 Director’s Commentary|work=PodBean|first= Ryan Stegman|last= Griffin Sheridan|date=22 June 2019|accessdate=26 June 2019}}}} Similarly, his title of the "King in Black" is a reference to [[Hastur]], the [[Wikipedia:King in Yellow|King in Yellow]] and ruler of [[Carcosa]].<!--

** Upon learning of him from [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] theorized that Knull was merely an aspect of the [[One Below All (Multiverse)|One Below All]] or a creature it somehow controls.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Immortal Hulk Vol 1 1}} The One Below All is himself [[One Below All (Multiverse)#Notes|possibly inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos]], as is Knull.
* Knull's history, and those of his successors as wielders of [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|All-Black]], are recorded in a self-writing divine tome called the ''[[Saga of the God Butcher]]''.{{r|King Thor Vol 1 1}}
* While [[Tanis Nieves (Earth-616)|Scorn]] stated that Knull had resurrected [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Cletus Kasady]] as a newborn when he died of nuchal cord strangulation, marking him as an agent of the Void,{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} this was fabricated by the [[Cult of Knull (Earth-616)|Cult of Knull]] in order to sensationalize Kasady as Knull's chosen one.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1174368004538347520|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: "The part where “Knull resurrected him as a baby” is completely untrue.

| Trivia                  = * According to Donny Cates, Knull was the first "something" in the universe,{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1134969329169162241|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter:"No. He was the first something."|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=June 1, 2019|accessdate=June 1, 2019}}}} indicating that he predates all but a few other deities and cosmic entities. Prior to {{cl|King in Black Vol 1 1}} providing clarification it was unclear if he was the first being in the seventh universe or if he predated the [[First Firmament (First Cosmos)|First Firmament]], with the existence of extraterrestrial symbiotes in [[Earth-TRN566|an iteration of the Cosmos]] predating the [[Glossary:Seventh Cosmos|seventh]] raising further questions.{{r|Spider-Man Adventures Vol 1 8}} Both [[Oblivion (Earth-616)|Oblivion]] and Knull claimed to be the incarnation of the primordial Void itself,{{r|Mighty Thor Annual Vol 1 1}} though {{cl|King in Black Vol 1 4}} depicts Knull as being only an avatar of Oblivion, the darkness having existed long before him. 
* As Knull predates the creation of the Seventh Cosmos, he is technically not from [[Earth-616]] or any other dimension within the Marvel Multiverse. However, since multiple iterations of Knull exist in other media taking place throughout the Multiverse and this iteration seems specific to Earth-616, he is designated as belonging to it.
* When asked what Knull would have done had he encountered [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage]] or one of Venom's other offspring, [[Ryan Stegman]] replied that he would have "either [tried] to hurt them or re-consume them and bring them back to [[Klyntar (Location)|Klyntar]]."{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Marvel/status/1045855682958888962|title=Marvel Entertainment on Twitter: "Longtime "Venom" penciler @RyanStegman joins Marvel's #ThePullList podcast host @AgentM to answer reader questions about the one and only Venom!

* Several beings have - deliberately or unintentionally - emulated Knull:
** Almost all of the [[Nameless (Kree) (Earth-616)|Nameless Kree]] infected by the Exolon develop a physical resemblance to Knull -- possessing pale skin, long white hair, and an emaciated physique.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith Vol 1 2}}

** [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-14412)|King Loki]] deliberately claimed the All-Black symbiote for himself with the intention of following in Knull's footsteps and destroying what was left of the universe, starting with his brother [[Thor Odinson (Earth-14412)|Thor]].{{r|Thor Vol 5 6}}{{r|Thor Vol 5 12}}
** When [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] bonded to the symbiote, it formed mirrored white spider emblems on its chest and back, which Spider-Man assumed was inspired by [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]]'s costume.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 8}} In reality, the symbiote unconsciously formed the white spider emblems in emulation of Knull's red dragon emblem.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/venom-white-spider-symbol-origin/|title=Venom Writer Confirms Origin of Venom's Iconic White Spider Symbol|work=CBR.com|first=Noah|last=Domiguez|date=4 January 2019|accessdate=4 September 2019}}}}
** [[Malekith (Earth-616)|Malekith the Accursed]] learned of Knull by reading the mind of the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]], and sought to turn it into his own version of All-Black; wielding it as a dagger and sword during the [[War of the Realms]].{{r|{{cl|War of the Realms Vol 1 3}}-[[War of the Realms Vol 1 4|4]]}}
** After assimilating the Venom symbiote, Dark Carnage was transformed into an even more powerful form sporting draconic wings and horns, and pauldrons and arm-wraps resembling Knull's.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 4}}
** [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]] formed a Necrosword similar to [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|All-Black]] using [[Venom III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|his new symbiote]], in order to kill [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Dark Carnage]].{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5}}

** During his invasion of Earth, most of the people infected by symbiotes resembled Knull.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 2}}{{r|King in Black: Gwenom vs. Carnage Vol 1 1}}
* When asked if [[Thanos (Earth-TRN666)|King Thanos]] had managed to kill Knull in the [[Earth-TRN666|future where he succeeded in killing everything]], Donny Cates stated that he hadn't due to Knull being unkillable;{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1120132305777983489|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: "Nothing can kill Knull. #GodIsComing"|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=21 April 2019|accessdate=22 April 2019}}}} later elaborating that Knull was probably happy to reclaim his kingdom of darkness from the ruins King Thanos left in his wake.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1257734458544971785|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: "Well, thanks to Thanos killing everyone. He was probably enjoying his dead and burning black kingdom out there in the void"|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=5 May 2020|accessdate=11 May 2020}}}} It is currently unknown how Knull managed to survive when more powerful and equally unkillable Cosmic Entities such as [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]] herself, along with the other aspects of the [[Cosmic Compass|Cosmic Compass]] were presumably killed.
* Ryan Stegman's concept art for Knull depicts him with a cape rather than a waistcloth, and questions whether or not he should have eyes and hair.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RyanStegman/status/1251905075070541824|title=ryan "venom boy" stegman on Twitter: "For #Creators4Comics, I’ll be auctioning off this, the original drawings of knull I did while talking to @doncates for the first time about our venom run!

* Despite Donny Cates' assertion on Twitter that "Nothing can kill Knull.", he was seemingly killed by Eddie Brock at the end of the ''[[King in Black (Event)|King in Black]]'' event. However, Donny Cates later stated that despite the destruction of his physical form, Knull isn't truly dead.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1389069084503990274|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: " Darkness never dies "|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=2 May 2021|accessdate=2 May 2021}}}}
