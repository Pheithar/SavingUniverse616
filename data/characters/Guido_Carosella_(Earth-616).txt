===Early Life===
Born in [[Rhinebeck]], [[New York (State)|New York]], to Italian parents, who tried to teach their son the value of a dollar, Guido Carosella showed this by earning a fortune in a settlement when his parents were killed by falling space debris. Skinny and shy, Guido's mutant powers were triggered in childhood when an incident with schoolyard bullies and being hit by a bus ended in his body becoming disproportionally large and overly muscled, separating the already withdrawn boy even further from his peers. Luckily, he had the love and support of his aunt and uncle, who had taken him in after his parents' deaths, and Guido coped with his pain, both emotional and the physical pain generated by his transformed body, by developing an outgoing "public face", rarely letting even those close to him see him in any discomfort. During the incident with the bus, another boy, [[Charles Ronalds (Earth-616)|Charlie Ronalds]], was uncontrollably hurt by Guido's flailing. Due to luck, Charlie survived with only a slight limp.{{r|X-Factor Annual Vol 1 8}}

===Bouncer===
After losing much of his fortune, he began to take on jobs that would allow him to maintain his luxurious lifestyle. This led to Guido becoming the long-time roadie and bouncer for the mutant musician [[Lila Cheney (Earth-616)|Lila Cheney]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 71}} He was later among the mutants living on [[Muir Island]] who were mentally controlled by the telepath [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]]. In order to satiate his bloodlust, the Shadow King encouraged arena fighting amongst the Muir Island personnel. Guido received a serious beating at the hands of [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 278}}

===X-Factor===
After the Shadow King was defeated, several of the Muir Island mutants, with the help of [[Valerie Cooper (Earth-616)|Valerie Cooper]], were recruited into the new [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] team. His teammates included the former [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] and [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], as well as [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]] and [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]]. Guido picked up the "Strong Guy" name from a joke he made at an X-Factor press conference when the press asked to know his code name.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 72}}
[[File:Thanos Vol 2 9 X-Men Trading Card Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|left]]

One of the first villains the team faced was [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] and his lackeys, the '[[Nasty Boys (Earth-616)|Nasty Boys]]'. Sinister wished to discredit mutantkind and used X-Factor to do so. One of Sinister's behind-the-scenes allies was a power-hungry Senator with the power to cause bad luck, who manipulated Strong Guy into destroying the Washington Monument while fighting [[Christopher Anderson (Earth-616)|Slab]], one of the Nasty Boys. The Senator, who was after the entirety of the X-Factor team, was later slain by Mr. Sinister himself.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 74|75}}

During his time on the team, he had a blossoming romantic relationship with a powerful Genoshan mutant and political dissident named [[Jo Beth (Earth-616)|Jo Beth]]. He even visited her Grandmother at her calm, suburban home on the island of [[Genosha]]. She took a shine to him instantly.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 89}}

Also, he participated in the cosmic incidents known as the Infinity War and Infinity Crusade. During the 'War', he and the other superheroes survived a bomb attack on the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] headquarters, thanks to the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]]. Strong Guy was specifically picked out to be one of the heroes to mystically travel the dimensions. He first participated in a fight with the Infinity Watch, holding up against such cosmic powerhouses as [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax the Destroyer]]. He would later be a vital part in the final battle against the villain's doppelganger's hordes, though this was a distraction so other forces could go in and defeat the villain.{{r|Infinity War Vol 1 3|4}}

During the 'Crusade' he was part of the assault team that landed in various spots around the Goddess' cathedral. Their goal was to gain back their brainwashed friends and defeat the Goddess's cosmic-powered plans. He teamed up with [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Firestar]] from the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]]. She was soon taken out by the brainwashed duo of [[Eugene Judd (Earth-616)|Puck]] from [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]. Strong Guy defeated Spider-Man in a swift, tree-smashing battle, despite being blinded by webbing to the face. [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], also brainwashed, soon restrained Strong Guy in a bubble of mystic force, where he stayed while events played out.{{r|Infinity Crusade Vol 1 5|6}}

Guido suffered a deep depression after being poisoned by [[Silas Burr (Earth-616)|Cyber]], the leader of the mercenary group [[Hell's Belles (Earth-616)|Hell's Belles]]. While at a government laboratory where a cure had been developed, Havok seemingly drank a sample of the poison himself, in order to show Strong Guy that he was with him. This helped boost Strong Guy's morale, though unbeknownst to him, Havok had switched the poison sample to simple tap water. Strong Guy later participated in the battle that took down the Hell's Belles, through Cyber himself escaped after colliding with a subway train.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 80|81}}

Another subway train incident turned out much worse, as Strong Guy investigated a train crash where a small dog was the only survivor. Inevitably, the carnage deeply affected his morale.{{r|X-Factor Annual Vol 1 7}}

Guido was once teleported naked from his shower by his old friend, Lila Cheney, who wished to show him the universe again. He managed to convince her that he had a life back in X-Factor, where she reluctantly returned him.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 94}}

Guido developed a deep friendship with the lycanthrope [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]]. They went on a road trip with the mutant [[Marshall Stone III (Earth-616)|Random]], where Guido showed Rahne his hometown friends.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 103|105}} Guido personally escorted Wolfsbane to Muir Island when she needed special medical attention.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 94}}

He remained a member of X-Factor until an incident in the South Seas island nation of [[Madripoor]]. Again involved with Lila Cheney, the team became trapped in a confrontation between her and the alien race, the K'Lanti. Lila had stolen an object of great value, called the Harmonium, during the midst of political chaos. The aliens, after destroying a city block, dispersed diamond-shaped bombs throughout the city. Despite the neutralization of the bombs and the return of their object, the aliens left behind one last explosive. Guido absorbed the energy of its explosion. Despite releasing it with powerful punches, he suffered a powerful heart attack.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 110|111}}

Guido spent much time in suspended animation, until the return of his seemingly-dead friend the [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]], Jaime Madrox. Not fully understanding the situation, Madrox freed Guido, who continued to suffer. [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]] created a device to heal him.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 135}} Afterward he chose to accompany Lila and her band in their travels instead of rejoining the increasingly fractious X-Factor team. Guido became involved in a property dispute between warring alien races, both of whom wished to control a small, barren moon. This dispute was settled when the moon was destroyed during an exchange of weapons on both sides.{{r|Strong Guy Reborn Vol 1 1}}

After leaving X-Factor, Guido fell on hard times. With Lila nowhere to be found, and finding it difficult to find hero work as a mutant, Guido opted to join the Arena in [[Tokyo]], a mutant fight club. Guido did not fully understand what he was getting into, however, and found himself enslaved. When [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] and [[Yukio (Earth-616)|Yukio]] came to investigate the club, Guido helped them bring it down together with [[Callisto (Earth-616)|Callisto]].{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 37|39}}

===X-Factor Investigations===
Strong Guy moved to [[New York City]] to become the enforcer for his friend Madrox's detective agency, [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations]], thus rejoining many of his former teammates from the government-sponsored incarnation of X-Factor. The team included Wolfsbane, [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]], [[Theresa Rourke (Earth-616)|Siryn]], [[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|Layla Miller]], and [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|M]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 1|2}}

Guido was assigned to protect a former employee of [[Singularity Investigations (Earth-616)|Singularity Investigations]], [[Henry Buchanan (Earth-616)|Henry Buchanan]], who had proof of their illegal activities. However, Guido instead killed the man and then called Singularity CEO [[Damian Tryp]], revealing he was working as a mole inside X-Factor.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 10}}

Guido tried to tell the team that the man had vanished on him but Wolfsbane smelled his blood on Guido's hands and a psychic scan by Monet revealed the truth. It seemed Guido had been subjected to hypnotic conditioning by Tryp to turn him into a mole (which explained his rougher attitude and some inconsistencies in his personality).{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 11}}

[[File:Guido Carosella (Earth-616) from X-Factor Vol 1 217 001.jpg|thumb|right|Guido gets shot]]
A visit with Henry's widow did not go as expected: instead of reacting angrily, [[Alix Buchanan (Earth-616)|Alix Buchanan]] understood the circumstances in which Guido had acted, and forgave him. They found solace together in their mutual grief from Henry's death.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 14}}

Despite Monet's recurring undermining behavior towards Guido,{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 38}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 41}} and clear lack of interest in him,{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 37}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 38}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 200}} he developed feelings for her{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 203}} and, when [[Cartier St. Croix (Earth-616)|her father]] was kidnapped, he offered to help her, refusing any payment.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 201}} 

Using some old contacts, Guido got some intel about the kidnapping, and the pair headed to his last known location in South America. While approaching the destination, their plane was gunned down and they were separated. Strong Guy found himself in a small village, where he was told to look for a "Señora Piernas". He paid her a visit and the cartel leader sympathized with him, revealing that some terrorists had suspiciously settled on an abandoned temple not long before. Before leaving, he was offered two guides to take him there and was advised to share his feelings with Monet.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 203}} 

At the temple, he was attacked by the sorcerer [[Karl Mordo (Earth-616)|Baron Mordo]], but after the arrival of [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar Trask]]'s forces, they both had to retreat to the temple, where Guido was reunited with Monet and her father. He learned that Mordo had kidnapped Monet’s father to get bring Monet to him and absorb her life energy to cure his cancer. As the temple was about to be bombed by the forces outside, Monet agreed to help Mordo with his illness in exchange for teleporting them all back to New York.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 203|206}}

After arriving, however, Monet tricked Mordo by using her telepathy, and he left thinking himself cured.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 207}}

During a protest, Guido was shot by [[Noelle Blanc (Earth-616)|Ballistique]], who was trying to assassinate [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|Mayor J. Jonah Jameson]], and his injuries were exacerbated when a Mandroid fell on him. As Monet flew him to the hospital, he professed his love for her. Unfortunately, his wound proved fatal, and he died in the hospital.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 217|218}}

[[File:Layla Miller (Earth-616) Guido Carosella (Earth-616) X-Factor Vol 1 219.png|thumb|right|Layla apologizes]]
[[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|Layla Miller]] used her reanimation powers to secretly bring him back to life, much to the astonishment of X-Factor and [[Doctor Castillo (Earth-616)|Doctor Castillo]]. In reality, she could bring people back, but not their souls, which led her to tearfully apologize and promise Guido she'd find a way to fix his situation, leaving Strong Guy as clueless as before.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 218|219}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 222|223}}

===King of Hell===
Guido began acting more aggressively, and after a frustrating failed date with M, quit X-Factor.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 241}} He later returned, working for [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] against the other Hell Lords,{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 251}} but, after Monet died, he betrayed everyone and murdered Wolfsbane's son [[Tier Sinclair (Earth-616)|Tier Sinclair]] in order to become the Supreme Hell Lord and have the power to revive her.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 256}}

When the [[Thunderbolts (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] were accidentally stranded in Hell, they made a deal with Mephisto to get out in exchange for dethroning the "pretender," who was revealed to them to be Guido.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 21}} Red Hulk fought against Guido and managed to convince Guido to abandon the position of Hell lord and try to regain his lost soul, allowing Mephisto to regain the throne and let the Thunderbolts return to Earth. Red Hulk offered Guido the opportunity to return with them, but he preferred to stay until he could regain his soul.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 22}}

===Return to Earth===
At some point Guido returned to Earth, where he assisted the X-Men in their assault on [[New Attilan]],{{r|IVX Vol 1 1}} and later joined his fellow mutants - including former teammates Rictor and [[Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse)|Shatterstar]] - in [[New Tian]].{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 3}}

Later, he and the New Mutants joined [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and Wolverine to form the newest incarnation of the X-Men. When Cyclops and Wolverine raided a prison to free all of its mutant prisoners, dupes of Multiple Man blew up. Guido was able to protect everyone by absorbing the energy of the explosion, but the strain on his body proved fatal. He collapsed and died looking at Magik.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 12}}

===Krakoa===
Following the foundation of a mutant state in [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] by the hand of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] and his allies, Strong Guy resurfaced as a citizen of the nation, having been presumably reborn by the hand of [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]], a group of mutants capable of combining their powers into a process of resurrection, brought together by Xavier as part of his plans for mutant ascension.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 1}}

| Powers                  = 
'''Kinetic Energy Absorption:''' Strong Guy has the ability to absorb kinetic energy and use it to enhance his physical strength to above normal limits. However, he cannot store the energy he absorbs for very long; as a rule, he must expend it within 90 seconds to prevent the enormous amounts of energy from permanently distorting his body. He is in constant pain from the existing distortion, although he hides it well, traditionally playing the role of team comedian to distract himself. An unusual percentage of his body mass is stored in the upper half of his body, causing him to appear top-heavy, imposing, and somewhat comical.{{citation}}

[[File:Guido Carosella (Earth-616) and Jennifer Walters (Earth-616) from She-Hulk Vol 2 31 001.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Catching She-Hulk by surprise]]
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' Guido possesses superhuman strength that varies depending upon the amount of kinetic energy his body absorbs. He possesses a base level of strength sufficient to lift approximately [[Strength Scale#Superhuman: 50+ tons to 75-ton range|50 tons]]. However, he can channel kinetic energy he absorbs to increase his strength. While the maximum amount of weight he can lift after absorbing as much energy as he can safely is not known, it doesn't greatly exceed 100 tons.{{citation}}

* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Strong Guy's musculature produces considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. He can exert himself physically at peak capacity for about 24 hours before fatigue begins to impair him.{{citation}}

* '''Superhuman Durability:''' The tissues of Strong Guy's body are considerably harder and more resistant to physical injury than those of an ordinary human. Strong Guy is capable of withstanding tremendous impact forces, exposure to temperature and pressure extremes, falls from great heights, high caliber bullets, and powerful energy blasts without sustaining injury. Under most circumstances, he could harmlessly absorb the energy produced by these attacks and increase his physical strength. However, he can still be injured as there is only so much energy he can safely absorb, and he can be hurt if the force is powerful enough.{{citation}}

| Abilities               = He is a multi-talented actor and stand-up comedian. He is also a formidable hand to hand combatant, often using street fighting techniques that allow him to make full use of his strength.{{citation}}
| Strength                = Class 50, Guido at a base level can lift 50 tons however with sufficient kinetic energy absorption Guido becomes class 100 and lift over 100 tons.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 200}}
| Weaknesses              = As a side effect of his powers, Guido possesses a bad heart that has given him problems in the past, including a serious heart attack that left him in a coma for several weeks. Guido can only absorb so much kinetic energy before his heart begins to weaken. He currently has a pacemaker that has greatly improved his heart. However, excessive strain or absorbing too much kinetic energy can overload his heart, as what happened while fighting the Hulk. Guido must also purge all the energy he absorbs within a 90 second period or risk having his body disfigured even more than it already is, possibly even to some fatal degree. He is also extremely nearsighted and wears thick corrective lenses.{{citation}}
