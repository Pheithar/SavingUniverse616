===Early Life===
===The Punisher===
[[File:Billy Russo (Earth-616) from Punisher Year One Vol 1 4 001.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Billy "The Beaut" Russo]]
Billy Russo was a favorite hitman for the [[Costa Family (Earth-616)|Costa mob]], nicknamed "the Beaut" because of his good looks.{{r|Punisher Year One Vol 1 3}} After the execution-style killing of [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Frank Castle]]'s family at the hands of the Costas, Russo was hired by the latter to assassinate [[Maurice Howles (Earth-616)|Maurice Howles]], another hitman who had earlier failed to kill Frank Castle, [[Michael McTeer (Earth-616)|Michael McTeer]], a freelance reporter who was helping Castle fight the Costas, and Castle himself. Russo killed all of his targets but Castle, who narrowly avoided death in an explosion. Hours later, Castle, now turned into the Punisher, tracked down Russo to one of the Costas' nightclubs: [[Salvagno's]]. Several criminals were killed, and Russo was thrown through a glass pane head-first.{{r|Punisher Year One Vol 1 4}} Somehow, he survived with his face torn to shreds; surgeons stitched it back together like a jigsaw puzzle.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #162}}

===Jigsaw===
Taking advantage of his now hideous visage, the formerly handsome gangster took on the identity of Jigsaw and initially attempted to frame the Punisher for murder. However, the plan failed due to the intervention of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]]; Spider-Man witnessed one of Jigsaw's murders and one of his victims was an old friend of Nightcrawler.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #161|162}}

===Facing Spider-Man Again===
Billy had been lying low due to Spider-Man, which began to annoy his men. Under their pressure, he agreed to plan a heist. They attacked a boat and demanded that everyone turn over their possessions. Unlucky for them Peter Parker was on the boat and had time to slip away to become Spider-Man and defeated the crooks, but Jigsaw managed to take [[Elizabeth Allan (Earth-616)|Liz Allen]] and [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Harry Osborn]] hostage. Not wishing his friends to be killed by Jigsaw, Spider-Man let them leave, but not before he could tag Harry with a [[Spider-Tracer]]. Spider-Man went on the hunt for Jigsaw, putting the crook into a state of fear during his pursuit. When Jigsaw finally got a bead on Spider-Man with his gun, Spider-Man called his bluff and the criminal found that he could not bring himself to shoot Spider-Man, and he was easily tied up for the police.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 188}}

===Trust===
Billy was behind a plan to drug the Punisher, causing his enemy to behave erratically and attack any criminals, even for things as minor as littering.{{r|Punisher Vol 1 1}} The Punisher confronted and beat him, and later stopped Jigsaw from escaping in a prison riot. Later on, Jigsaw was brainwashed by the [[Trust (Earth-616)|Trust]] into serving as a new member of a Punisher-style assassination squad. He managed to remember who he was after encountering Castle once again, and he attacked the Punisher, but was once again beaten.{{r|{{cl|Punisher Vol 1 4}}-[[Punisher Vol 1 5|5]]}}

===Endless War===
Billy became involved with a demon worshiper he referred to as 'the [[Samuel Smith (Earth-616)|Rev]]'. Based on small healing demonstrations, the Rev convinced Jigsaw to work for him in exchange for healing his face. Jigsaw followed the man on a home invasion/murder spree and then killed several cops on the way out. This incident warmed him to the concept of worshiping [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Lucifer]].{{r|Punisher Vol 2 #35|61}}

Billy was a persistent foe of the Punisher's for years. While he still worked as an assassin for criminal organizations, his pursuit of the Punisher was relentless, as Jigsaw saw Castle's assassination as an unfinished job. The deranged gangster's vendetta once took a bizarre turn when the Punisher faked his death by appearing to be executed in prison. Furious with rage, Jigsaw briefly became a new Punisher, getting revenge on Castle's apparent killers for denying him the kill he believed to be rightfully his.{{r|Punisher Vol 3 #2|10}}

===Hell's Kitchen===
Daredevil and the Black Widow took down Jigsaw. Mistaking him for the wrong kind of Kingpin, Jigsaw makes bail and comes to ask Matt if he can have permission to run crime in [[Hell's Kitchen]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 #62}} Jigsaw and his men came to Matt again and he cannot become Daredevil in time.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 #63}} Rather than prove completely that he is DD, Matt has to let the police and the Widow break up a home invasion of the Murdock residence by Jigsaw.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 #64}}

===The Raft===
He was imprisoned on the maximum security prison known as the [[Raft]], a floating prison for supervillains and other high-risk criminals. He was one of the many inmates trying to break out, Jigsaw was among those who were stopped by the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 1|4}}{{r|Spider-Man: Breakout Vol 1 1}}

===Hood's Gang===
Billy was hired by the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]] to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the [[Superhuman Registration Act]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 35}} Now part of the [[Hood's Gang (Earth-616)|Hood's Gang]],{{r|New Avengers Annual Vol 1 2}} he battled the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] during their [[Secret Invasion]] of Earth.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 46}} He was with the team when they took on the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] and [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 50}} He was with the gang when they were attacked by the Punisher.{{r|Punisher Vol 8 9}}

During this time he also renewed his own criminal career with the Hood's blessing. He was still unbalanced and obsessed with Frank and had [[Lynn Michaels (Earth-616)|Lynn Michaels]] brainwash a man named [[Ian (Auxiliary Police) (Earth-616)|Ian]] to act as the [[Punisher]] so as to frame Frank, and hired the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] to try and kill him before hiring the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]] in order to kill him when the Hand and Ian failed and Frank was transferred to the [[Raft]] by [[George Washington Bridge (Earth-616)|G.W. Bridge]]. They were promised $50 million if successful. However they were all defeated by the Punisher as he received help from the [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]] who was sent by [[Stuart Clarke (Earth-616)|Stuart Clarke]]. The Punisher used [[Wrecker's Crowbar]] in order to finish off [[Eliot Franklin (Thunderball) (Earth-616)|Thunderball]] and then also used it on Russo, who repeatedly told Frank that he loved him but also wanted to kill him, as well as asking Frank to kill him before his arrest. Lynn, who had actually been an undercover agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. later allowed Ian to shoot Russo in his cell, feeling guilty for what she had done to him to maintain her cover.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 18|23}}

===In the Blood===
When Stuart Clarke tried to kill Russo's [[Henry Russo (Earth-616)|son]], Punisher acted. After an explosion, Henry let Jigsaw fall to the flames of a burning building.{{r|{{cl|Punisher: In the Blood Vol 1 1}}-[[Punisher Vol 1 5|5]]}} Jigsaw resurfaced months after his apparent death.{{r|Civil War II: Kingpin Vol 1 1}}

===Return to Hood's Gang===
Jigsaw attended a meeting of various villains organized by the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]] to discuss what to do about [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] who had unexpectedly decided to become a superhero and become the new [[Iron Man]]. As the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]] brought up the idea of forming a gang of villains to take Doom out, Doom suddenly appeared and took down all of the villains present.{{r|Infamous Iron Man Vol 1 7}} He later participated in an ambush against Doom along with many of the other villains that Doom had earlier defeated.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 594}} He also attended a meeting to discuss the Hood's rise as the Kingpin of crime.{{r|Defenders Vol 5 10}}

===Thunderbolts===
After impersonating the Punisher and ruining his reputation{{r|Punisher Vol 12 7|9}} [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s leader [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] and [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Mayor Fisk]] came up with a plan to deal with Castle once and for all. Along with other villains, Jigsaw joined a new incarnation of the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] in the role of the mercenary [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]]. He was introduced at a press conference with the other members as Citizen V pronounced that they will end the Punisher's reign of terror and restore order to [[New York City]].{{r|Punisher Vol 12 13}}
