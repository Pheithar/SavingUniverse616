===Origin===
[[File:Wreaking Crew (Earth-616) from Defenders Vol 1 18 0001.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The origin of the Wrecking Crew]] When [[Dirk Garthwaite (Earth-616)|Dirk Garthwaite]], the original Wrecker, claimed his powers by gripping his enchanted crowbar in a lightning storm, a bolt struck the tool as three other men held it as well.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 #17|18}} Ex-Physicist Dr. [[Eliot Franklin (Thunderball) (Earth-616)|Eliot Franklin]] became Thunderball, Ex-Army Master Sergeant [[Henry Camp (Earth-616)|Henry Camp]] became Bulldozer, and Ex-Farmhand [[Brian Calusky (Earth-616)|Brian Calusky]] became Piledriver. Although this quartered the Wrecker's prodigious strength, the team remained together and remained a formidable force. Their powers are of mystical origin, and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] is one of their common opponents. Their first appearance, however, saw them face the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] as they were destroying buildings belonging to Richmond Enterprises while attempting to find a miniature gamma-bomb that Eliot Franklin had lost years before. They were eventually defeated by the combined might of the Defenders and [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Power Man]], and [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] was able to disarm the gamma-bomb before it leveled New York City.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 #19}}

Loki, Ulik, and the [[Amora (Earth-616)|Enchantress]] were also interested in the Wrecker, but for reasons of their own. Thor and Code:Blue race to the scene of the battle, and the Wrecker causes his new abilities to make Excalibur see Thor as the Juggernaut.

===Pleasant Hill===
At some point in time, Wrecking Crew were imprisoned by S.H.I.E.L.D. in [[Pleasant Hill]], a prison in the form of a small town where its inmates had their memories and appearances tampered with using a sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] named [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]], so they could be turned into model citizens. When a group of villains led by [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] snapped out of this fantasy world and returned to their true selves, they attacked the village from within, wrecking havoc and freeing the other prisoners from Pleasant Hill's control.

The Wrecking Crew was one of these numerous villains. When the bad guys took notice of the presence of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] on the scene, they used their numbers to their advantage and mercilessly stroke down the heroes. However, Kobik took compassion on the Avengers and healed them.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 7}}.{{r|Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 6}}

===Secret Empire===
The Wrecking Crew became members of Baron Zemo's new incarnation of the Masters of Evil and targeted the newest incarnation of the Thunderbolts. They attacked [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Atlas]] until [[Helen Takahama (Earth-616)|Jolt]] showed up to help him. The Masters of Evil subsequently managed to capture the Thunderbolts.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 10}} Atlas, [[Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|Fixer]], and [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Moonstone]] defected from the Thunderbolts and sided with the Masters of Evil following a battle with the Thunderbolts that resulted in the apparent death of Man-Killer.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 12}} Afterwards, the new Master of Evil joined the expansion Baron Zemo carried out for the enterprise of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] and its leader, an [[Earth-61311|alternate reality]] [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America]]: the [[Army of Evil (Earth-616)|Army of Evil]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 13}}

The Wrecking Crew aided in Hydra's plan to take over the United States by launching an attack on Manhattan along with the Army of Evil in order to lure out many superheroes as possible. The Army of Evil was later teleported away while Baron Zemo used the [[Darkhold]] to boost the powers of [[Marcus Daniels (Earth-616)|Blackout]] and trap half of Manhattan in a Darkforce dome, trapping the superheroes who fought the Masters.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} The Crew later took part in a fight against any remaining superheroes in [[Washington, D.C.]] as Hydra moved toward the capital to secure its takeover of the country.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2017 Secret Empire}} The Crew also killed off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Moth Squadron (Earth-616)|Moth Squadron]] after ambushing them in a warehouse, but the Squadron's sole survivor, [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Quake]], managed to escape with her life after using her powers to bring down the warehouse's roof on top of the Wrecking Crew.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 1}}

After Hydra took over the United States,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} the Wrecking Crew along with the Army of Evil were all placed in stasis by Hydra out of fear of what they would do if they were allowed to remain free. When a contingent of superheroes who opposed Hydra's regime known as the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]] launched a massive assault against Hydra in [[Washington, D.C.]], Baron Zemo was ordered to awaken the Masters along with the Army of Evil to turn the tide. He was stopped by [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and Winter Soldier before he could accomplish his task.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}} After the Hydra regime fell{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}}, the Wrecking Crew were likely freed from stasis and taken into custody.

===Return to Hood's Gang===
The Wrecking Crew attended a meeting of various villains organized by the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]] to discuss what to do about [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] who had unexpectedly decided to become a superhero and become the new [[Iron Man]]. As the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]] brought up the idea of forming a gang of villains to take Doom out, Doom suddenly appeared and took down all of the villains present.{{r|Infamous Iron Man Vol 1 7}} They later participated in an ambush against Doom along with many of the other villains that Doom had earlier defeated{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 594}} before joining Hood's Gang once more in ransacking Castle Doom in search for Doom's fortune.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 597}}

| Equipment               = 

* '''[[Bulldozer Helmet]]:''' Bulldozer has a specially-made armored helmet, neck and shoulder apparatus that gives him added protection and invulnerability when ramming an opponent. The helmet partially affects his peripheral field-of-vision. 
| Transportation          = 
| Weapons                 = 
* '''[[Wrecker's Crowbar]]:'''  The Wrecker wields a four-foot long cast iron crowbar which has become virtually indestructible through extensive contact with the Wrecker's enchanted skin. Wielded by the superhumanly strong Wrecker, the crowbar becomes a weapon of vast destructive potential. The Wrecker has used the crowbar to demolish entire buildings in minutes and to hold off the thunder god, Thor, in battle. The Wrecker has used the crowbar offensively as both a throwing weapon and a bat. Because of the teachings of Ulik, The Rock Troll, he can throw his crowbar and have it return to him, much like Thor's own hammer.

* '''[[Thunderball's Ball and Chain]]:''' Thunderball possesses a highly durable wrecking ball, altered because of exposure to the Wrecker's power, much in the same way the Wrecker's crowbar. The ball is attached to a four foot long chain and is capable of projecting electrical energy bolts and an energized exoskeleton suit. The suit is only used when not in possession of his regular wrecking ball and superhuman powers. The wrecking ball, when thrown, is capable of returning to Thunderball in a similar fashion as Wrecker's crowbar and Thor's hammer. Thunderball has sufficient strength to spin the wrecking ball on it's chain fast enough to deflect bullets and automatic gunfire. By slamming the wrecking ball on the ground, Thunderball can cause minor localized quakes, knocking his opponents off-balance. It is also durable enough to be thrown into buildings and other structures, knocking them down with no damage to itself. In the past, The Hulk and Hercules both have, with extreme effort, destroyed the wrecking ball with their bare hands. When this happens, Thunderball doesn't suffer any ill psychic effects and simply obtains a new wrecking ball. However, the wrecking ball then has to be energized by The Wrecker himself to gain the increased resistance to damage.
