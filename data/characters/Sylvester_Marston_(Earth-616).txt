===Origins===
Sylvester "Snake" Marston was born in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 4}}. He was a skilled contortionist, but turned his skills to crime. {{r|Machine Man #16}}

===Satan Squad===
[[Walther Theodoric (Earth-616)|Baron Brimstone]] teamed up with Snake and  [[Willard Harrison (Earth-616)|Hammer Harrison]] to form the [[Satan Squad (Earth-616)|Satan Squad]] in a series of crimes that would enable him to mass-produce the Sol-Mac weapon. When Satan Squad member [[Duke Dawson (Earth-616)|Duke Dawson]] tried to rat out Brimstone to [[Pamela Quinn (Earth-616)|Pamela Quinn]] of [[Delmar Insurance Company (Earth-616)|Delmar Insurance Company]], Snake and Hammer confronted them, and Snake wrapped his body around Dawson, crushing him to death. They turned Pamela over to Baron Brimstone. Later, Hammer and Snake led the Satan Squad in an attempt to steal the golden bell of the cathedral St. Gabriela of the Highlands, only to be confronted by [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]]. Snake tried to wrap himself around the robot, but Machine Man spun himself at a terrific speed, hurtling Snake into the Satan Squad. Machine Man went on to defeat Baron Brimstone. {{r|Machine Man #16}}

===Enforcers===
Snake and Hammer were recruited into the [[Enforcers (Earth-616)|Enforcers]]  by the [[Oswald Silkworth (Earth-616)|Arranger]], the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]]'s top man. The original Enforcers were initially hesitant to accept them, but they proved their abilities in a brief scuffle with the others, and then they were formally welcomed by [[Daniel Brito (Earth-616)|Fancy Dan]], [[Jackson Brice (Earth-616)|Montana]] and [[Raymond Bloch (Earth-616)|Ox]] . The Arranger charged the Enforcers with the task of maintaining the Kingpin's extortion rackets, and the team made good on that in the days that followed, threatening and beating store owners and burning down property. When one of their targets was candy store owner [[Roberto Cassada (Earth-616)|Roberto Cassada]], they provoked the ire of the [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]], who was renting a room from Cassada's family. The Enforcers happened to run into [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], and managed to defeat him with their superior numbers. They chained him up and brought him to their hideout so that he could be turned over to the Kingpin, but Sandman came to Spider-Man's rescue. Snake was knocked out by Spider-Man.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #138}}

===Eel===
He was impersonated by the [[Eel]] as part of a plot involving [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mister Hyde]], and the Enforcers.{{r|Daredevil #356}}

===Seagate Prison===
Snake was imprisoned in [[Seagate Prison]]'s supervillain cell block.{{r|Thunderbolts #53}} 

===Civil War===
During the [[Civil War]] event, he was captured by [[Baron Zemo]]'s [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] and forced to join them or face jail time. He attended a practice session held by the [[Andreas von Strucker (Earth-616)|Andreas von Strucker]].{{r|Thunderbolts #104}}Marston joined Thunderbolts army recruits [[Peter van Zante (Earth-616)|Aqueduct]], [[Simon Maddicks (Earth-616)|Killer Shrike]], [[Jalome Beacher (Earth-616)|Slyde]] and Ox in battling citizens of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] who had been overcome by the energies unleashed by the Universal Wellspring.{{r|Thunderbolts #107}}
