===Early Life===
M'Baku was born and raised in the [[Jabari Village]] within the nation of [[Wakanda]], [[Africa]]. He was one of the greatest warriors of the African nation Wakanda, second only to [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|T'Challa]], the Black Panther himself. While the Panther, King of Wakanda, was on leave from his royal duties to serve the Avengers in America, the ambitious M'Baku plotted to usurp the throne. The Wakandan culture evolved from a hunter-warrior society and was traditionally ruled by its greatest warrior. The Black Panther outlawed the rival [[White Gorilla Cult (Earth-616)|White Gorilla cult]] from Wakanda while the [[Panther Cult (Earth-616)|Panther cult]] was dominant. M'Baku flouted T'Challa's edicts and revived the White Gorilla cult, personally stalking and killing one of the rare [[White Gorillas|white gorillas]] living in the jungles near Wakanda. Bathing in the gorilla's blood and eating the gorilla's flesh mystically conferred its great strength upon M'Baku.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 62}}

When the Black Panther returned to Wakanda with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], M'Baku, calling himself the Man-Ape, openly challenged the Panther's right to rule. M'Baku deplored T'Challa's technological revitalization of Wakanda and sought to have all technology outlawed so the nation could return to primitivism. After a protracted battle, the Man-Ape bested the Panther; however, when he bound T'Challa to the giant statue of a panther and tried to topple it upon his enemy, the statue instead crumbled, burying M'Baku.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 62}}

The Black Panther, believing the Man-Ape was crushed,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 62}} returned to New York with the Avengers. But M'Baku's chief supporter [[N'Gamo (Earth-616)|N'Gamo]] revived the rebel.

===Lethal Legion===
M'Baku followed the Panther to New York. There the Man-Ape allied himself with the [[Eric Williams (Earth-616)|Grim Reaper]] and his Lethal Legion, a short-lived team of Avengers' foes including the [[Arthur Parks (Earth-616)|Living Laser]], [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Power Man]], and the [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]]. The Man-Ape kidnapped Monica Lynne, the Black Panther's American girlfriend, and lured the Panther into captivity. When the rest of the Avengers came to the Panther's rescue, Captain America bested the Man-Ape.{{r|Avengers #78|79}}

The Panther decreed if the Man-Ape returned to Wakanda, he would face the death penalty. Humiliated, the Man-Ape chose to wander the less civilized parts of the world, performing mercenary work to survive and keeping a low profile. He was eventually contacted again by the Grim Reaper, who was trying to assemble a new Lethal Legion to exact revenge upon the Avengers. The Man-Ape served as one of the Grim Reaper's henchmen until the Reaper's racist attitudes prompted the Man-Ape (and fellow Legionnaire Black Talon) to abandon the Reaper's cause.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #1|2}}
<!-- 
===Acts of Vengeance===
During the [[Acts of Vengeance]] event, [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] used an Aggression Enhancer on him and a group of other villains to attack the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] when they stood before Congress.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 #336}}

===A.I.M. Weapons Expo===
He was among the many criminals to visit the A.I.M. Weapons Expo on [[Boca Caliente]] but the event was crashed by [[Captain America (Steven Rogers)|Captain America]].{{r|Captain America #411|413}} 
-->
===Masters of Evil===
M'Baku joined the seventh incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] gathered by the [[Justine Hammer (Earth-616)|Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)]]; however, he was sucker-punched by the Thunderbolts as they infiltrated the Masters' base, having no part to play in the battle that followed.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 #24|25}}

===[[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]]===
[[File:Pan-African Congress on the Treatment of Superhumans (Earth-616) from Civil War Battle Damage Report Vol 1 1 001.png|250px|thumb|right|M'Baku posing with (from left to right) [[Khairi Ngala (Earth-616)|Afrikaa]], [[Zanda (Earth-616)|Zanda]], [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]], [[Moses Magnum (Earth-616)|Moses Magnum]] and [[Joshua N'Dingi (Earth-616)|Joshua N'Dingi]]]]
M'Baku represented the [[Jabari Tribe (Earth-616)|Jabari Tribe]] at the [[Pan-African Congress on the Treatment of Superhumans (Earth-616)|Pan-African Congress on the Treatment of Superhumans]], hosted in [[Wakanda]] in search of a consensus on how to react to the [[United States of America|American]] [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. The representatives failed to reach an agreement before the Congress disbanded.{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report Vol 1 1}}

===Encounter with Morlun===
Totemic hunter [[Morlun (Earth-001)|Morlun]] was resurrected in Wakanda, where he murdered Man-Ape by sucking the life out of him and feeding on his totem.{{r|Black Panther Vol 5 4}}

He reappeared alive and joined the [[Villains for Hire (Earth-616)|Villains for Hire]] assembled by the [[Zebediah Killgrave (Earth-616)|Purple Man]] and [[Headhunter (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Headhunter]] to build a criminal empire by selling their services to the highest bidder as opposition to the Heroes for Hire.{{r|Villains for Hire Vol 1 #3|4}} 

===Pleasant Hill===
At some point in time, Man-Ape was imprisoned by S.H.I.E.L.D. in [[Pleasant Hill]], a prison in the form of a small town where its inmates had their memories and appearances tampered with using a sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] named [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]], so they could be turned into model citizens. M'Baku, and a group of villains led by [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]], snapped out of this fantasy world and returned to their true selves.  They attacked the village from within, wreaking havoc and freeing the other prisoners from Pleasant Hill's control.

When the bad guys took notice of the presence of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] on the scene, they used their numbers to their advantage and mercilessly struck down the heroes; however, Kobik took compassion on the Avengers and healed them.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 8}}

===Death and Resurrection===
M'Baku died yet again, this time under unknown circumstances, and the mantle of the White Gorilla was taken up by his brother, [[Mandla (Earth-616)|Mandla]], though he too eventually joined M'Baku in death.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 4}}

[[Baron Macabre (Earth-616)|Baron Macabre]] raised M'Baku from the dead via an elaborate ritual that granted Man-Ape supernatural powers;{{r|Black Panther: Long Live The King Vol 1 3}} however, Macabre believed the arrival of [[Kantu (Earth-616)|Kantu]]'s mechanical drones were a bad omen, thus M'Baku soon cast the shaman aside for lacking faith in him and seemingly having already served his purpose. After Man-Ape was eventually dealt with by the combined efforts of Black Panther, Kantu, and [[Shuri (Earth-616)|Shuri]], Macabre stripped him of his newfound abilities and fled.{{r|Black Panther: Long Live The King Vol 1 4}}

| Powers                  = Man-Ape possesses various superhuman abilities as the result of a magical ritual of transference with the sacred White Gorilla.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #3}}

'''Superhuman Strength:''' Due to the ritual, Man-Ape possesses superhuman strength enabling him to lift up to about 2 tons.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #3}}

'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Man-Ape's advanced musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. He can physically exert himself at peak capacity for up to a day before the build up of fatigue toxins in his bloodstream begins to impair him.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #3}}

'''Superhuman Agility:''' Man-Ape's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are significantly beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #3}}

'''Superhuman Durability:''' Man-Ape's bodily tissues are somewhat harder and more resistant to certain types of injury than the body of an ordinary human; however, he is far from invulnerable. Man-Ape's body is more resistant to blunt force and impact trauma than the body of an ordinary human. For example, he can withstand being hit repeatedly by a superhumanly strong adversary or falling from a height of several stories with little to no injury to show for it, whereas an ordinary human would be severely injured or killed.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #3}}

| body = '''Arcane Energy Manipulation:''' M'Baku's resurrection had bestowed and infused his body with an arcane energy which he could discharge in unique ways such as energy blasts. The more he utilized the power the greater his energy output became.{{r|Black Panther: Long Live The King Vol 1 4}}
