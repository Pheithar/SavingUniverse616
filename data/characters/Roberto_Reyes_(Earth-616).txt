| History                 = [[File:Roberto Reyes (Earth-616) from All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Robbie's true appearance]]
Robbie Reyes was a young mechanic working in [[East Los Angeles]], [[California (State)|California]]. The neighborhood he lived in, [[Hillrock Heights]], was plagued with gangs and corruption, making life difficult for him and his brother, [[Gabriel Reyes (Earth-616)|Gabe]], who looked up to him as a hero.

Eager to move to a safer neighborhood, Robbie entered a street race to earn fifty thousand dollars. Unbeknownst to him, the car he used was inhabited by a ghost. As he was taking the lead; however, he was followed by whom he assumed to be the police. Worried about what would happen to Gabe without him, Robbie tried to escape, but inadvertently drove into a dead end. He left his car and attempted to explain himself to his pursuers, only for them to violently open fire upon him, killing him. They attempted to burn the car and Robbie's body; however, as they left, the ghost possessed Robbie, transforming him into a new Ghost Rider.{{r|All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 1}} The Ghost Rider gave chase and managed to take out a handful of Robbie's attackers, though some of them got away.

[[File:Robbie Reyes (Earth-616) from All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 1 001.png|thumb|left|Robbie's first transformation into the Ghost Rider]]

Robbie awoke the next morning, believing the events had simply been a nightmare; however, he soon found that one of his eyes was now orange. Concerned, he returned to the workshop where the car had been, [[Canelo's Auto and Body]]. While attempting to take it out for another drive, he was confronted by two thugs, who worked for the owner of the car. Robbie became the Ghost Rider again and attacked them, before driving to a junkyard and reverting. The Ghost Rider appeared as Robbie's reflection, and Robbie asked the Rider what it is, to which it responded; "The real question is... what are ''we''?".{{r|All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 2}} The demon revealed itself to be a spirit named [[Elias Morrow (Earth-616)|Eli]], and offered Robbie a chance to seek vengeance towards those who have done wrong. After some brief thought, Robbie accepted.

Robbie later returned to the garage where he worked, to find his boss murdered and the car stolen. Eli claimed to know who had done this, and Robbie transformed into the Ghost Rider. The Rider teleported to the car and merged with it, attacking the drug cartel who had stolen it. He prepared to finish them off, when their leader suddenly took some [[Hyde Formula|mysterious pills]] and mutated into a massive, hulking creature.{{r|All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 3}} Robbie won the battle after a brutal fight,{{r|All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 4}} though was soon confronted by [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mr. Hyde]]. He managed to defeat Hyde as well,{{r|All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 5}} and quickly became a protector in the eyes of local residents. Unwilling to become a vigilante, Robbie began using his powers to make money off of street races, which allowed him to work less and spend more time with Gabe, much to Eli's dismay.{{r|All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 6}}

[[File:All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 8 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Fighting Johnny Blaze]]

This new-found fame caught the attention of the original Ghost Rider, [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Johnny Blaze]], who traveled to [[Los Angeles]] to confront the new Rider, intercepting Robbie just after Eli's influence caused him to accidentally kill a street racer.{{r|All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 7}} Eli, completely assumed control of the new Rider, escaped, and gradually took over Robbie's body in his human form to seek out revenge on a Russian mob boss named [[Yegor Ivanov (Earth-616)|Yegor Ivanov]]. Eli was revealed not to be a [[Spirits of Vengeance (Earth-616)|Spirit of Vengeance]], but rather a Satanic serial killer who murdered and dismembered at least 37 people in rituals before he was fatally shot by the police in 1999, and who lived in [[Reyes Residence|the house that the Reyes brothers took to living in]].{{r|All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 8}} After Johnny subdued Eli with a [[Penance Stare]], he briefly spoke with Robbie, warning him that he must take care not to let Eli reawaken; however, Robbie rushed home, discovering that Eli, in his body, had left Gabe alone and hungry on the floor, a trauma that caused Gabe to mentally regress, becoming detached and unfocused.{{r|All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 9}} Robbie later fought off Mr. Hyde's gang. When Robbie permanently bonded with Eli's spirit, he told Eli that they would dispose of anyone with an evil soul.{{r|All-New Ghost Rider Vol 1 12}}

When the Final Host of [[Dark Celestials (Horde)|Dark Celestials]] invaded the [[Earth]], Ghost Rider was among the group of heroes brought together to defend the planet,{{r|Avengers Vol 8 3}} having been specifically chosen as an ally for [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] by the [[Celestials (Race)|Celestial]] [[Eson (Earth-616)|Eson the Searcher]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 2}} Robbie joined the final battle against the Dark Celestials by using his powers to take over the corpse of a dead Celestial.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 5}} The [[Horde (Race)|Horde]] that had infected the Dark Celestials and was seeping through the Earth was finally defeated when the Avengers used the [[Uni-Mind (Earth-616)|Uni-Mind]], channeling all of their powers into the Celestial-possessing Ghost Rider. With the Horde laid dormant, the heroes joined forces with the Celestials to defeat the Dark Celestials.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 6}} The heroes that were brought together by the Final Host subsequently banded together to reform the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], with Ghost Rider giving it a try despite his feelings of inadequacy.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 8}}

[[File:Avengers Vol 8 6 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|With the Avengers]]

Before the arrival of the Final Host, Robbie experienced odd behavior in his powers, with the Hell Charger becoming silent,{{r|Avengers Vol 8 2}} and also taking him in his sleep to the resting place of the Dark Celestial [[Zgreb (Earth-616)|Zgreb]] in South Africa before he was awakened. When this happened, Robbie was attacked by the [[Kevin Connor (Earth-616)|Starbrand]], whom he accidentally killed when he subjected him to the Penance Stare, despite not being a Spirit of Vengeance himself.{{r|Marvel Legacy Vol 1 1}} Robbie's powers were further thrown in disarray when the Avengers were confronted by the [[Legion of the Unliving (Vampires) (Earth-616)|Legion of the Unliving]] and they used incantations to corrupt and subvert Robbie{{r|Avengers Vol 8 15}} until Avengers recruit [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]] cleansed him.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 16}}

Becoming fed up with the Hell Charger's increasing misbehavior, Robbie enlisted the help of his teammates to exorcise the vehicle and free it from the mysterious new spirit possessing it. When the exorcism went wrong, Robbie was sent to Hell,{{r|Avengers Vol 8 22}} where Johnny Blaze, the recently-crowned King of Hell, challenged Robbie for a race for his power.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 23}} Robbie was assisted by the Spirits of Vengeance of old and eventually by the Avengers,{{r|Avengers Vol 8 24}} who managed to reach Robbie in Hell. Robbie won the challenge, but instantly abdicated the throne of Hell back to Blaze. With the Hell Charger freed from the influence of Eli's spirit, Robbie embraced his powers as the Ghost Rider and his place with the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 25}}

| Personality             = Robbie Reyes is a hardworking and caring teenage boy. Though still a teenager, he serves as a guardian and a father figure towards his younger brother, [[Gabriel Reyes (Earth-616)|Gabe Reyes]]. He has no intentions, whatsoever, to become a hero or vigilante. Instead, he simply wants to provide a better and safer lifestyle for his brother.

Most of the time, a lot of people see him as a well-polished individual. Receiving good performances in school and endlessly searching ways to earn money for a better livelihood. However, there are times where he would do risky things and decisions (mostly evident from the pieces of advice given by his Uncle Eli) endangering himself in the process such as attending illegal street races. This is more evident during his time as the Ghost Rider. Some people also secretly find some form of attractiveness to him.

===Relationships===
One of Robbie's greatest achievements is his younger brother. Though an incomplete family, they would both do what normal families do on a daily basis. Due to the medical condition Gabe is currently experiencing, he will always give him a helping hand (even at times, violently). This eventually leads him to persevere harder.

On the other hand, he made a pact with his satanic Uncle Eli to feed his evil blood lust. Their spiritual bond grows stronger every time they kill and punish criminals. He also gets furious when his uncle tells him the disgusting truth about his family and has difficulty on agreeing and disagreeing the suggestions he offers. Some of which he would actually do if the situation turns desperate. Robbie has strong will power to resist that urge on inflicting rage only if his uncle comments of how most people are rubbish.

| Powers                  = In human form, Robbie does not possesses any superhuman powers, but as Ghost Rider, he's the supernatural combination between human host and the evil satanic spirit of his uncle, [[Elias Morrow (Earth-616)|Eli Morrow]].
