===Early History===
'''Peter Quill''' was conceived as a result of the love between the terran Meredith Quill and the Spartax Emperor at the time, [[J'son (Earth-616)|J'son]]. J'son left Earth soon after conceiving Peter in order to continue his intergalactic war, leaving Meredith on Earth in order to protect her. Nine months later, during an unusual astronomical phenomenon when many of the planets aligned, Peter was born and not much later his mother Meredith, for reasons she could not quite explain, had the urge to take him outside and present him to the stars.{{citation}}

For ten years, Quill was raised by Meredith who remained a single mother but had help from her best friend [[Lisa Chang (Earth-616)|Lisa Chang]] and her daughter [[Monica Chang (Earth-616)|Monica]]. Peter soon started developing a big interest in sci-fi shows and after a visit to an amusement park where he was impressed by the wonders of space, he decided he wanted to be an astronaut when he grew up, however he was a little disappointed later when he found out the aliens on the ride weren't real.

[[File:Peter Quill (Earth-616) Marvel NOW! Point One Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|left|Peter finds the strange device.]]
One day Peter returned home, bruised from trying to stop a bully. As he was washing up for dinner, his mother saw a bright light and two Badoon aliens emerged. Vowing to end the '[[Spartax (Race)|Spartax bloodline]]', they killed Meredith. After Quill saw the aliens and his dead mother, he panicked and ran. As the aliens pursued, he grabbed a shotgun and managed to kill them with it. He then found a mysterious device in a closet. Seeing a bright light he fled the house, just before the alien ship destroyed it.{{r|Marvel NOW! Point One Vol 1 1}}

Quill was placed in an orphanage where he had much trouble adapting and finding a foster home, he never lost his desire to become an astronaut, leave Earth and find the aliens that killed his mother though. Eventually, Lisa, now a NASA commander, got him a job as a mechanic in the NASA Ops Launch Facility on California. Once there, Peter started training in secret with the simulators during all his free time. One day, after an altercation with an important Astronaut, Lisa had no choice but to discharge Peter from his position at the facility. Feeling this was his last chance to get to space, he stole a Kree ship, managed to outfly the security of the station, and left Earth.{{r|Star-Lord Vol 1 1}}

Not long after he had left his birth planet, the Kree ship Peter stole malfunctioned. He was stranded in orbit for three days until the pirate crew commanded by [[Yondu Udonta (Earth-616)|Yondu]] found him and tried to steal his ship. Peter managed to outsmart every member of the crew and even knocked out Yondu before capturing him. After he woke up, Yondu managed to set himself free from his restrains and attacked Peter and gave him a choice between letting himself be released to space without more trouble or get killed right there, Peter instead asked him if he could join his crew, Yondu wasn't sold on the idea but after he found out Peter was like him, a kid without a home, Yondu changed his mind and let him stay in the ship with his pirate crew as the cleaning boy. Peter decided to stay and try to learn everything he could from space while he was part of the pirate crew.{{r|Star-Lord Vol 1 2}}

[[File:Peter Quill (Earth-616) and Lisa Chang (Earth-616) from Star-Lord Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|right|Peter deciding what he wants to do with his life.]]
Yondu eventually heard about the Asterion One from Peter and demanded he help to steal it for the Ravagers. Peter had doubts at first but Yondu promised to give him a gem that contained the location of the Badoon ship that killed his mother. Consumed by revenge, Peter helped Yondu to board the Asterion One and capture all the crew inside. Peter, who was having second thoughts, managed to steal the gem from Yondu and was prepared to leave Lisa and the crew behind to fulfill his dream of revenge, however he realized that wasn't what his mother would've wanted for him and came back to free the crew and expel Yondu out. He decided against pursuing revenge anymore and, once the Colony was settled on planet Xerxes, set out to find his destiny in the stars as the "Star-Lord".{{r|Star-Lord Vol 1 5}}

===Star-Lord===
Two years later after he began his travels, he met Ma Savage and started funding her orphanage.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: Black Vortex Alpha Vol 1 1}} He also, at some point, met his father J'Son of Spartax, the son of emperor of the Spartax Empire. He learned about his heritage and his birthright to become the Star-Lord, however the meeting didn't end well, as J'Son wanted him to become the prince of Spartax and rule alongside him while Peter resented the idea of anyone being the owner of the galaxy, preferring to see it free to create and live. They both parted ways in bad terms.

At some point, Peter met a sentient starship called "[[Ship (Star-Lord) (Earth-616)|Ship]]" with whom he travelled the galaxy for some time, policing the universe and righting wrongs.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord Vol 1 1}}

Some time later, Ship stumbled upon the [[Fallen One (Herald) (Earth-616)|Fallen One]], a former [[Heralds of Galactus (Earth-616)|Herald]] of [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] who was trying to starve his former master out by destroying all the planets he could feed on. Star-Lord thought he could handle the threat and was almost killed in his first battle with the entity but Ship managed to save his life and nurse him back to health. Despite what had happened in their first encounter, Star-Lord was still convinced that he could handle the Fallen One so he and Ship tracked the insane ex-Herald to a [[Kree]] fringe system where the Fallen One had targeted [[Avaleen-4]], an agricultural world whose inhabitants had established a small mining operation on one of the planet's moons. By this time, Ship had discovered that the life energies released when the Fallen One destroyed planets caused him pain. In order to prevent the Fallen One from destroying Avaleen-4 and killing its millions of inhabitants, Ship and Star-Lord realized that they would have to channel a vast amount of life energy against him and that the only way in which they could generate that much energy would be by sacrificing thousands of lives. Feeling that they had no other choice, Ship decimated the mining colony and funnelled the resulting surge of life energy through her ordnance matrix against the Fallen One. Their strategy worked and the Fallen One was rendered unconscious but the act of channelling that much energy killed Ship. The millions of people on Avaleen-4 were saved but Star-Lord had become a mass murderer in the process, having caused collateral damage in the form of 350,000 deaths,{{r|Thanos Vol 1 12}} so he turned himself and the Fallen One over to the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]] for punishment. While many were divided about Quill's guilt, he and the Fallen One were subsequently imprisoned in the intergalactic prison known as the Kyln.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Peter Quill (Earth-616) from Annihilation The Nova Corps Files Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|Peter during his time in the Kyln.]]
It was while in the Kyln that Peter decided to get his first cybernetic implant, something which he viewed as part of his choice to run away from his humanity.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord Vol 1 1}} While in the Kyln, Peter allied himself with [[Ch'ak (Earth-616)|Ch'ak]], [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]] and [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] against the [[Maker (Earth-616)|Maker]] in fear of her immense power. They filled Thanos in on her background, and asked for his assistance, but he just walked out. Later, Peter observed a giant explosion in the Kyln, and assumed that it was Thanos who caused the Maker to attack. They went to the explosion site, and Gladiator filled Peter in on how he and the Maker got into the Kyln. When Gladiator asked Peter on how he got in the Kyln, he declined to answer.

Later, after Thanos had defeated the Maker, Peter found out that the Fallen One had escaped. He told Thanos about this, and Thanos went off, presumably to deal with it. Peter made his way around the Kyln and was met by Gladiator who was going to leave, now that the Maker was incapacitated for good. Gladiator told Peter that he had drafted Peter into the Shi'ar Guard, to Peter's disapproval. He met up with Gladiator's Shi'ar allies later on, and was told that they weren't going after the Fallen One nor Thanos, but that they decided they wanted Peter to help them.{{r|Thanos #7|12}}

===Annihilation===
A couple months after the Kyln and [[Xandar]] were destroyed in the first days of the [[Annihilation (Event)|Annihilation War]], Peter organized the [[United Front (Earth-616)|United Front]] with [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova Prime]] to battle the Annihilation Wave led by [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]] from conquering their universe.

On the 183rd day of the war, Peter and Nova Prime were defending [[Daedalus 5]] from the wave. They were aided by [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax the Destroyer]], [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]], [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan the Accuser]] and his [[Kree]] warriors, and the former heralds of [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]], [[Pyreus Kril (Earth-616)|Firelord]], [[Red Shift (Earth-616)|Red Shift]] and [[Lambda-Zero (Earth-616)|Stardust]]. They managed to hold the defense while the former heralds attacked and destroyed the mothership, and captured [[Extirpia (Earth-616)|Extirpia]]. Days later, Peter filled in Nova about the health status of Firelord after he exploded fighting Extirpia. The two then interrogated Extirpia, who revealed that Thanos was working with Annihilus, and that they had defeated and captured Galactus and his current herald, [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]].

A few days later, Peter and Nova Prime met with the leaders of the Kree division of the United Front, House Fiyero and Ronan the Accuser. House Fiyero had some problems working with Ronan because Ronan was a fugitive from the Kree empire. They threatened to leave the United Front if Nova Prime and Peter didn't arrest Ronan. Nova Prime furiously shot down the demand, and a small argument erupted. Ronan then slaughtered all of House Fiyero, which angered Nova Prime. Just then, Gamora arrives with [[Praxagora (Earth-616)|Praxagora]] and the news of [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]]'s death.

Just then, [[Ravenous (Earth-616)|Ravenous]], [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax]], [[Paibok (Earth-616)|Paibok]], and [[Infant Terrible (Earth-616)|Delinquent]], and many more arrived on Daedalus 5 via Thanos' teleportation technology and the United Front were forced into battle. Negative Zone [[Centurions]] later arrived as well, and so did an Annihilation Wave flagship, with a weaponized Galactus aimed to devour the planet. The United Front retreated while Red Shift and Stardust covered their escape, dying in the process. Peter, Nova Prime, Ronan, Gamora, the one-time Captain Marvel [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-616)|Phyla-Vell]], Praxagora, the miraculously revived Super-Skrull and Drax's human companion, [[Camille Benally (Earth-616)|Cammi]] were among the few who escape. After the severe loss, the United Front disbanded.

Later, Peter informed Nova Prime that Ronan was going to [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]] to take down the rest of House Fiyero, and Praxagora and Super-Skrull would be going with him too. Peter suggested calling on the heroes of Earth, so Nova Prime then tried reaching the Fantastic Four, but his hopes for saving Earth were completely shattered when he learned of [[Civil War (Event)|what was happening]] between the heroes. Peter then told him that he'd be accompanying him on his next plan to attack Annihilus head on. Peter, Nova Prime, and Phyla-Vell all went to the ruins of the planet Xandar where they teleported deeper into Wave territory. On [[Canticus Prime]], they met up with [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]] and his [[Spaceknights]]. They finally teleported their way the center of the Annihilation Wave, and attacked Annihilus head on. They were losing until the Quantum Bands that Annihilus acquired off the dead [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]] attached themselves to Phyla-Vell, turning the tide of the battle. She weakened Annihilus, and Nova Prime killed him. After the war was over, Peter was filled in by the rest of the factions that aided in destroying the Annihilation Wave. He told the stories to Nova Prime as he was recovering from the battle.{{r|{{cl|Annihilation Vol 1 1}}-[[Annihilation Vol 1 6|6]]}}

===Annihilation: Conquest===
He was later assigned by Ronan to be in charge of rebuilding the Kree defense network. The Space Knights offered to upgrade Hala's defense systems with new tech and give them an army of Centurions. Peter pitched it to Ronan and Ronan quickly accepted the offer. Peter had the Spaceknights bring the Centurions to Hala for a few threat scenario exercises. However, the Centurions began to attack Hala, and when Peter confronted the Spaceknights about this, they revealed themselves and their "Trojan Horse"-like ploy. One of the Spaceknights broke Peter's arm and he was forced to flee. He fell out a window of a building while trying to escape.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Prologue #1}}

Peter awoke after surgery on the Kree planet, [[Aladon Prime]]. He was removed of all his cybernetic attachments, including his left eye, and was briefed on the [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]]'s conquest of Hala and the rest of the Kree Empire. Admiral Galen-Kor, the person in-charge of Peter's recovery, revealed the Phalanx's plan to infect the Kree with an airborne techno-virus that would put the Kree under their control. Galen-Kor requested that, in exchange for nursing him back to health, he'd lead a commando team into Hala to destroy the machine that would release the techno-virus. He agreed, and he met with the team. The team consisted of prisoners that the Kree had caught over the years; there was a Kaliklak warrior known as [[Bug (Insectivorid) (Earth-616)|Bug]], a Shi'ar berserker codenamed [[Sharra Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathcry]], the Celestial Madonna [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]], a former Terran soldier that went by the name [[Gabriel Vargas (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]], a lower life form known as [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]], and a flora colossus that called himself [[Groot (Earth-616)|Groot]]. Peter was given his old Star-Lord outfit, with a few upgrades. He trained the team for a couple of days until they were dropped off in Hala.

They infiltrated and were met with heavy resistance. The team was a pretty dysfunctional one, with Peter seeing them more as an expendable team rather than allies in battle. They sneaked through most of Hala, looking for the biotech reproduction facility, when suddenly a battle between some of Annihilus' remaining bugs and the Phalanx broke out. Deathcry jumped into the battle, revealing the rest of the team. During the battle, Deathcry attacked Captain Universe, and in an act of self defense, Captain Universe disintegrated Deathcry. The team retreated and was also forced to leave Groot behind as he covered their escape.

After two days of no luck finding the facility, Peter went alone on a reconnaissance mission to find it. He looked through classified Kree archives, and there he found that they had already released the virus as a airborne nanovirus ‚Äî meaning that everyone on the planet were slowly becoming infected. He returned back to the sewers where he told the team of his plan. Not long after, they were attacked by the Phalanx. Captain Universe covered their escape and they made it out into the streets of Hala. However, Peter, Rocket Raccoon, Bug, and a tiny little Groot (who regrew after his destruction) were captured on the street not long afterwards. Mantis was able to turn herself invisible and Captain Universe defeated all of the Phalanx down in the sewers, so they weren't captured. Peter and his teammates were later about to be dissected by the Phalanx, but Mantis and Captain Universe saved them. They made their escape, only to find Kree soldiers in their way. The Kree soldiers decided to let Peter and company go due to Peter's reputation as the Starlord. Mantis explained to Peter that they risked the Kree soldiers threw away their lives to save his, because the Starlord was an ideal. They commandeered a Kree ship and flew out of Hala to Alon-Gin. There, he was debriefed on the outcome of their mission. Since Captain Universe got the genetic information of the virus when he was rescuing the team, the Kree were able to come up with a cure. Also, the team was clean of infection. The team came to Peter saying they were ready for the next assignment, despite Peter's clear unwillingness.{{r|{{cl|Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord Vol 1 1}}-[[Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord Vol 1 4|4]]}}

A few days later, Peter was back on Hala with his commando team. He had now become the secret leader of the anti-Phalanx resistance. Rocket reported to him that Blastaar had been captured, tortured and killed by the Phalanx, as per the plan. Blastaar brought with him spores that would map the entire Babel Spire, the heart of the Phalanx power. They got into the tower and set up the bombs that would cripple the tower, allowing the Kree empire to be accessible to outside forces. However, all of a sudden, a mind-controlled, resurrected Blastaar appeared and killed Captain Universe. Peter would've been killed too had it not been for the appearance of the Phalanx's leader, [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]], who was enraged and wanted to torture somebody. Ultron tortured him, trying to get information on the anti-Phalanx resistance's plans, but Peter wouldn't give it up nor would the mind scans work, for Mantis was telepathically shielding him. Ultron later found Mantis and sent the Phalanx to attack her. Peter was physically drained, and passed out.

He was awakened by Mantis, Bug, and Rocket, saying that they had a plan of escape. They ran through the Babel Spire and jumped out of the building. It was revealed Groot expanded and wrapped himself around the tower and detonated his body, and so the tower was destroyed. Groot was once again "killed" doing a heroic act. Mantis told Peter that she had foreseen that three members would be lost during the fight against the Phalanx, and the third she revealed to be herself. Just then, Ultron arrived in the body of [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]] and struck Mantis across the head. Before Ultron could attack Peter and his crew, Nova Prime arrived with Gamora, Drax, and the [[Technarchy]], and attacked Ultron and his Phalanx. Peter was leading his injured team away from the battle when he saw that the Phalanx were building another giant structure, which would turn out to be a giant version of Ultron. He watched as Phyla-Vell, now going by the name Quasar, and Adam Warlock (with his own consciousness back in his own body) attacked and defeated the giant Ultron.

The Kree empire was saved and everything slowly went back to the way things were. Star-Lord would hang out with Nova Prime, Gamora, and Drax once in a while. He saw to Mantis' and Groot's recuperation. Peter blamed himself for the Phalanx invasion, and so he sought to make it right.{{r|{{cl|Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 2}}-[[Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 6|6]]}}

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
[[File:Peter Quill (Earth-616) from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 9 001.jpg|thumb|Star-Lord battling Skrulls]]
After Ultron and the Phalanx were defeated, Star-Lord formed the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The universe was in a very fragile state after the two Annihilation events, and fissures in reality were beginning to form and spread. In order to prevent the collapse of the universe, he had Mantis telepathically nudge Adam Warlock, Phyla-Vell, Rocket Raccoon, Drax, and Gamora into joining his team. This motley crew set up base in the severed head of a Celestial, called Knowhere.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 1}} When Star-Lord's deception was found out, everyone but Mantis and Rocket (including Star-Lord himself) quit the team in disgust and set off on their own quests.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 6}}

Star-Lord responded to a Kree summons and returned to the Kree homeworld to speak with [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan]]. Upon arriving, he is shocked to see that they are rebuilding the Phalanx Spire to protect Kree space. He argued with Ronan and was then thrown into the Negative Zone. He was then forced into helping the newly appointed ruler of the Negative Zone, King Blastaar, into taking over the Superprison 42 so he could gain access to their portal to Earth.

Star-Lord was then sent into 42 to convince them to open the door and surrender. Once inside he spoke with the unofficial leaders of 42 and told them not to surrender, but only [[Jack Flag]] agreed with him. They tried to stop them but the doors were opened and Blastaar's army was unleashed; after learning of his betrayal, Blastaar sent his men to find and kill Star-Lord. Running for their lives, Star-Lord and Jack Flag located a telepath in 42 to ask the Guardians for help and they were able to escape before being killed by [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]].{{Citation}}

===War of Kings===
Once he returned to Knowhere, Peter found that Rocket had assembled a new team, consisting of [[Vance Astro (Earth-691)|Major Victory]], [[Bug (Insectivorid) (Earth-616)|Bug]], [[Groot (Earth-616)|Groot]], and Mantis. Eventually, the other members returned as well; Adam and Gamora returning in order to still help the universe, and Drax and Phyla returning with the newly resurrected Moondragon.

Their first order was to split up and attempt to end the War of Kings, which would cause irreparable damage to the fabric of the universe. Peter led his team to Hala to speak with the Inhumans. Even after telling them the dangers of their war, they refused. Phyla, who now called herself Martyr, had other ideas of negotiating and took [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]] hostage. Star-Lord could not get her to release her prisoner and they were teleported back to Knowhere.

Upon their return, they soon found themselves in the middle of a battle with the Inhumans and the [[Imperial Guard]], who had followed the other team back. After rescuing Crystal, the [[Inhumans]] left and the Guardians were left to face the Imperial Guard, who wished to take over the station. In the process of the battle, Starhawk escaped her captivity and took Star-Lord, Mantis, Bug, Jack Flag, and [[Cosmo (Dog) (Earth-616)|Cosmo]] to her future.

In [[Stakar Ogord (Earth-691)|Starhawk]]'s bleak future, she was finally able to convince them what she had been saying all along was true. A massive fissure was consuming the universe and it had to be stopped. The two Guardians teams worked together to try to send a message back through time to warn that the fissure, known as the Fault, was actually caused during the [[War of Kings]] by [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]].

With their time machine broken, they formed a new plan. The Badoon, who now ruled what little was left of the universe, had enslaved the Celestials and created what was called the Celestial Engine, used to keep the fissure at bay. They send back their message and break the alignment of the Celestial Engine, causing the destruction of this future.

To Star-Lord's surprise, this did not kill them. They found themselves in a different time with a different set of Guardians. Another surprise: he was old enough to be his own grandfather. The Starhawk of this future received messages from his previous selves and learned the truth. The team was adrift in time, which was causing their changes as well. They formed a plan to find a time machine under [[Avengers Mansion]], but once they got there they slipped through time once again. And again. And again.

They finally arrived at an alternate future, one ruled by the [[Magus (Earth-7528)|Magus]] and the Universal Church of Truth. While battling the members of the Church, they had an unexpected guest: Kang the Conqueror. He returned them to their normal states and took them to his headquarters in Limbo. He explained that all futures were becoming Magus futures and it was up to Star-Lord to stop this from happening.

Kang gave Peter a [[Cosmic Cube]] and told him that future must be saved at all costs. They were sent back to moments before Adam would turn into the Magus while repairing the Fault. Star-Lord tried to talk to Adam, but the damage had been done. He had overlapped the time lines and essentially he had been the Magus for months.

Adam transformed and began his battle with the Guardians, who were all reunited. After killing Major Victory, Mantis, Cosmo, Gamora, and Phyla, Star-Lord was finally able to grab the Cube and use it to revert the Magus back to Adam. Adam told him that he must finish him, and to his own regret, Star-Lord shot and killed his friend. The universe had been saved, but the price was very high.{{Citation}}
===Thanos Imperative===

[[File:Peter Quill (Earth-616) and Richard Rider (Earth-616) from Thanos Imperative Vol 1 6.jpg|thumb|left|Peter and Richard's last stand.]]
Adam managed to avoid death, however, and Magus continued in his service to [[Mar-Vell (Earth-10011)|Lord Mar-Vell]], a Mar-Vell from a universe where death had lost and life had triumphed, resulting in a universe of immortal monsters. The denizens of Lord Mar-Vell's universe, [[Earth-10011|the Cancerverse]], came out of the fault in order to consume their universe.

Peter Quill, together with the rest of the Guardians, Nova, and Thanos traveled into the Cancerverse in order to stop Mar-Vell and the Old Ones whom Mar-Vell served. Drax, however, was driven mad due to the fact that he was an avatar of life in a universe where life had triumphed, and he tried to kill Thanos, who in turn vaporized him.

The Guardians and Thanos met up with the Machine Resistance, the unliving robotic denizens of the Cancerverse who were immune to Mar-Vell's conversion of his universe and fought to stop him ever since. They informed Thanos and the Guardians that Mar-Vell was planning a Necropsy, in which he would kill the Avatar of Death (Thanos) thus killing Death itself. Thanos seemed to betray the Guardians when he submitted to Mar-Vell, but when Mar-Vell ran him through with a sword, Death appeared and, due to being summoned by Thanos, killed the entire Cancerverse and forced the Old Ones into a long-term coma. Death refused to take Thanos with her and he flew into a rage, vowing to destroy the universe. Peter and Nova volunteered to distract him, managing to keep him in the Cancerverse long enough for it to collapse and presumably kill all three of them.

Thanos, Star-Lord, and Nova remained in the Cancerverse fighting over the [[Cosmic Cube]]. A returned Drax joined the brawl against the Mad Titan. After Star-Lord started losing control over the Cube, Thanos offered for Quill to give him the Cube, as he could control it to get back to Earth-616.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 18}} Instead, Star-Lord killed Thanos with it. Thanos then reappeared, and killed Star-Lord from behind, but Star-Lord also returned. The heroes discovered death was impossible in the Cancerverse, as one would merely respawn in another location.

After killing Thanos for a third time, the heroes' discussion on what to do was interrupted by the arrival of the resurrected Cancerverse's [[Revengers (Earth-10011)|Revengers]]. Following an extremely long battle, the Revengers got hold of the Cosmic Cube.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 19}} Thanos managed to retrieve the Cube and defeat the Revengers, but was soon opposed by Drax, Quill, and Nova. While the Mad Titan was distracted by Drax, Nova picked up the Cosmic Cube and decided to use it along with the Nova Force to open a gate to Earth-616. However, Rider couldn't come along as he was acting as the door between the two universes. As his last wish, Nova asked Peter not to tell Gamora about this event, as it would devastate her.

Peter Quill, Drax, and Thanos were then returned to Earth-616.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 20}}

===Return===
Peter disappeared after the Cancerverse events until a reunion with his father J'son alerted him that the [[Galactic Council (Earth-616)|Galactic Council]] had decided that Earth was off-limits for all empires from now on. This pushed Peter to reform the Guardians of the Galaxy in order to protect Earth from many invasions that were coming thanks to that new rule.

They aided the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] to fight Thanos, who had once again targeted Earth following his return. Thanos managed to get a Cosmic Cube from the Army, with which he escaped to Moord, the homeland of the [[Badoon]]. The Guardians arrived at the [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] and informed the Avengers about the situation.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 5}} They joined the Guardians to fight Thanos and the Badoon.

After Thanos apparently killed the [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elders of the Universe]], to impose his supremacy,{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 7}} he became one with the Cosmic Cube and killed the Avengers and the Guardians as well. But actually they were sent to the Cancerverse along with the Elders. While there, Tony Stark found that Thanos' weapon wasn't actually a Cosmic Cube and that it had defects. They bargained with the [[Collector]] in exchange for a weapon capable of deactivating the "Cube" and return to Earth. The Avengers and the Guardians would let Thanos be defeated by the Elders. With the help of other members of the Avengers, Thanos was defeated and sent to punishment by the Elders.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 8}}

Shortly after Iron Man joined the group, the Guardians fought a Badoon invasion on Earth.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 1}} They were briefly imprisoned by Spartax forces after defeating the Badoon in [[London (England)|London]],{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 2}} but managed to escape, becoming fugitives of the Spartax Empire.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 3}} The Guardians later encountered a warrior named [[Aldrif Odinsdottir (Earth-616)|Angela]], who later joined their ranks.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 #5|7}}

During [[Infinity (Event)|Thanos' invasion on Earth]], the Guardians helped [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]] recover control over the [[Peak VII|Peak]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 #8|9}}

===The Trial of Jean Grey===
Peter and his team intercepted a conversation that revealed the Shi'ar were planning on abducting a teenage Jean Grey and put her on trial for the crimes of her older self. Peter decided to go and alert the X-Men but arrived too late, as the Shi'ar had already taken Jean.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 11.NOW}} The X-Men and the Guardians teamed up to rescue her, and in route to the Shi'ar empire, he met [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]], the leader of the X-Men. Both teams were subsequently assaulted by a Shi'ar ship, but saved just in time by the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]],{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 23}} who joined the heroes' mission.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 12}}

[[File:Katherine Pryde (Earth-616) and Peter Quill (Earth-616) from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 13 001.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Kitty's first kiss to Peter]]
They arrived to [[Chandilar]], the Shi'ar homeworld, and confronted the Imperial Guard.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 24}} After recovering Jean Grey, who had escaped custody, and was later able to subdue Gladiator, the Guardians and the X-Men left the planet. When the Guardians took the X-Men back to Earth, Star-Lord gave Kitty an holographic phone to keep in touch.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 13}}

Soon after, Star-Lord and the Guardians were individually captured by different galactic empires to be dealt with separately, as planned by J'son and the Spartax, who wanted his son to join him in his place as the prince of Spartax, but also to make him pay for his crimes against the Spartax Empire.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 14}} Peter managed to escape custody with the help of [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], one of the Guardian's recent recruits. Before fleeing from Spartax, Peter took advantage of J'son's live broadcast of Quill's trail and exposed his father's corruption, inciting a rebellion{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 #15|16}} After recovering his ship, Star-Lord and Captain Marvel proceeded to recover their teammates, except the newly-inducted [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]], who went into hiding after escaping a run-in with the Skrulls.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 17}}

===Mister Knife===
After escaping from Spartax, Peter decided to search for [[Mandalay Gem|a very powerful gem]] to settle his feud with Thanos once and for all. After sneaking into an orphanage to search for the gem he left behind by the Spartax, Peter was confronted by a group of Badoon bounty hunters. Outnumbered, Peter was captured by the Badoon. While imprisoned, Peter discovered that a mysterious "Mr. Knife" placed the bounty on his head and that he also had plans for Earth. Soon after, Peter escaped the ship with the gem only to come face-to-face with the commander of the Spartax Royal Guard who turned out to be the sister he didn't know he had, Victoria.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 1}} She turned him over to Fortress Viderdoom for the bounty, but quickly turned on Quill's captors to help him escape and steal Viderdoom's assets. The siblings escaped the planet together, narrowly avoiding death. When back on her ship, Victoria offered half of the money to Peter but he declined it, saying he was in it for the adventure.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 2}}

During this time Peter kept in touch with Kitty Pryde, usually calling her while being imprisoned.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 1}}{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 3}} His feelings for Kitty started to grow, but put them aside to deal with Thanos once and for all. Powered-up with the [[Mandalay Gem]], Star-Lord confronted Thanos on the Earth's moon, and managed to subdue him after a furious fight. However, Star-Lord was convinced not to execute Thanos, due to the resultant release of energy being capable of destroying the Earth. Reluctantly, Peter let him go, dropped the gem and decided to change his life and start pursuing a relationship with Kitty instead.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 4}}

Soon after finding Agent Venom, the Guardians came into contact with the [[Symbiotes (Race)|Symbiote]], the original race of symbiotes. Upon returning from the planet of Klyntar, Star-Lord received the news that after his father's overthrow he had been elected as the new president of Spartax.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 #21|23}}

===Black Vortex===
Following the news of his unexpected political career, Peter decided to keep a low profile. He discovered that Mr. Knife's group of mercenaries, the [[Slaughter Lords (Earth-616)|Slaughter Squad]] were ordered to hunt him down, and also that Knife was looking for the mysterious [[Black Vortex]].{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 5}} During a long-distance date with Kitty Pryde, Peter was kidnapped by the Slaughter Squad and taken to their flying fortress, where Mister Knife revealed himself as J'son.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 6}} Mister Knife tried to brainwash his son into being of use for his plans, but Kitty Pryde, who had travelled all the way from Earth to space, rescued him.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 7}}

Both escaped and went straight to Spartax where they spent some time at the Savage orphanage, the home of some allies of Peter. After convincing Kitty to stay in space with him, she convinced him steal the Black Vortex from J'son to annoy him.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 8}} However, when they infiltrated Mister Knife's fortress, they discovered the Black Vortex was no ordinary object, it was a mirror with the ability of unleashing an individual's cosmic potential. Now fearing of such powerful item being in J'son's hands, Star-Lord and Kitty stole the artifact. They turned to both the Guardians of the Galaxy and the X-Men for help.

The cosmically-empowered Slaughter Squad, now calling themselves Slaughter Lords, pinned the heroes down in order to retrieve the Black Vortex. While not outnumbered, the heroes where outmatched. During the battle, Gamora submitted to the Black Vortex's power, giving the Guardians and the X-Men the necessary edge to escape to Spartax's moon.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: Black Vortex Alpha Vol 1 1}} There, Peter tried to convince his allies to submit altogether to the Black Vortex, in order to defeat the Slaughter Lords. Kitty opposed him, claiming that such incredible powers could corrupt them. Both [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]]{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 24}} and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] submitted. The immense power corrupted them and Gamora, who betrayed their fellow allies when they tried to destroy the Black Vortex. Soon after they escaped with the Vortex, the Guardians and the X-Men were attacked by Mister Knife's flying fortress.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 9}}

[[File:Peter Quill (Earth-616) and Katherine Pryde (Earth-616) from Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men Black Vortex Omega Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|Peter Quill proposing to Kitty]]
They survived the attack, and fled on Star-Lord's [[Bad Boy]], subsequently coming across the Starjammers, who offered their help.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 38}} When Gamora, Beast, and Angel assaulted Hala after their [[Accuser Corps (Earth-616)|Accuser Corps]] stole the Black Vortex for help, Star-Lord and a group of heroes heeded the call for help.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 38}} Ronan the Accuser empowered himself with the Black Vortex and fended off the attackers.{{r|Guardians Team-Up Vol 1 3}} However, Mister Knife's flying fortress arrived to recover the Vortex, and used its entire firepower to destroy Hala. The Guardians and X-Men there escaped.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 25}}

When J'son recovered the Vortex,{{r|Nova Vol 5 28}} he used it on his ally [[Thane (Earth-616)|Thane]], who proceeded to encase the entirety of Spartax in an amber construct, trapping its inhabitants in a state of living death. Mister Knife had made a deal with the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]], providing them of the host bodies necessary to reproduce, in exchange of taking part of their planetary conquest.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 10}} When the heroes retrieved the Black Vortex once again,{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 11}} Kitty Pryde used it on herself to enhance her abilities and phase Spartax through the amber carcass, saving the planet and its inhabitants, at the same time she managed not to succumb to her new abilities.

Once the dust settled and the Black Vortex was dealt with, Star-Lord proposed to Kitty Pryde, and she said yes.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: Black Vortex Omega Vol 1 1}} Back in Spartax, he had to resolve the problem of his election and after some encouraging words from Kitty, he decided to give in to the desire of the people of Spartax and become the new leader of the Empire.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 27}}

===Secret Wars===
Peter and the rest of the Guardians traveled to [[Earth]] to help defend it from a colliding alternate version of said planet, during the last of the phenomena known as [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]], which caused universes to collide. The eventual collision between the two planets caused the total destruction of all of reality, with Star-Lord being the only survivor of his team, after being teleported by chance to a [[Future Foundation's Life Raft|life raft]] that survived the end of the Multiverse.{{r|Secret Wars #1}}

Star-Lord and the other heroes in the raft were awakened after spending eight years in stasis, finding themselves in [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]], a patchwork planet composed of the remnants of several realities, ruled by the omnipotent [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|God Emperor Doom]] with an iron fist. Their welcomer was [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], the Sorcerer Supreme of the previous universe who had helped Doom achieve goodhood, thus becoming his right hand and sheriff of Battleworld.{{r|Secret Wars #3}}

Star-Lord and the other heroes were later teleported and scattered across Battleworld by Strange, in order to prevent them from suffering the unfair wrath of Doctor Doom, who had recently learned of the existence of these interlopers.{{r|Secret Wars #4}}

Peter ended up in the domain of the [[Kingdom of Manhattan]], a domain composed of the remains of the [[New York City]] of his former world. Looking for a place to hide from Doom, he ended up in a nightclub known as the Quiet Room, becoming a singer under the name of "Swingin' Stevie Rogers."

One day, Quill found a [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-51518)|Kitty Pryde]] of an [[Earth-51518|alternate reality]] in the midst of the [[Quiet Room]]'s clients. She was an agent of [[Valeria von Doom (Earth-15513)|Valeria von Doom]]'s [[Foundation (Earth-15513)|Foundation]] and was negotiating with [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-61610)|Gambit the Collector]] to get an anomaly he had acquired, an "anomaly" being an object that could defy the doctrine of Doom, namely any evidence that pointed to the existence of something before this world. Quill foiled the negotiations when he appeared to defend her against Gambit's flirtations. Gambit fled, taking the anomaly with him. During the ensuing struggle, a device Pryde used to identify if an anomaly was authentic confirmed that Quill's origin was unknown, thus making him a living anomaly. Surprised, Pryde handcuffed him to herself and decided to take him with her to further studies.{{r|Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde #1}}

[[File:Kitty Pryde (Earth-51518) and Peter Quill (Earth-616) from Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde Vol 1 3 0001.png|thumb|right|Kitty and Peter sharing a passionate kiss.]]
In order to discover Gambit's whereabouts and retrieve the anomaly in his possession back, Pryde and Quill followed his trail to a [[Guggenheim Museum|museum]] in Midtown.{{r|Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde #2}} After capturing Gambit, Peter discovered the anomaly in his possession was Rocket Raccoon's tail. As it was the only thing left of Quill's home reality and a remaining part of his lost friend, Pryde let him keep it. After kissing him, she departed for [[Doomstadt]] to report to her superiors.{{r|Star-Lord and Kitty Pryde #3}}

At some point in time, Peter traveled to the satellite Knowhere where he found his old teammates who had been recreated to recruit them in the fight against Doom.{{r|Guardians of Knowhere #4}} During an uprising against Doom, the Reed Richards of [[Earth-616]] and [[Earth-1610]] requested Star-Lord's services to fly them to [[Castle Doom (Doomstadt)|Castle Doom]].{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 7}}

Doctor Doom's reign was ultimately overthrown by Reed Richards, who managed to seize Doom's power and use it to begin recreating the lost Multiverse, including his native reality and all of its inhabitants,{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 9}} but with no memories of their temporary demise.{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 1}}

===King Quill===
[[File:Peter Quill (Earth-616) from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 1 001.jpg|left|thumb|150px|As King of Spartax]]
Over the following months, Peter resumed his work as king. His overwhelming schedule, inexperience in politics, and desire to satisfy everyone; eventually pushed his friends away. Angry at this, Rocket took the leadership position in the Guardians from Peter and left to resume their work. Peter's still fianc√©e Kitty Pryde became distant and bitter at Peter's lack of attention and also left him to join the Guardians as the new Star-Lord. Despite having lost both his best friend and his fianc√©e, Peter bitterly remained as King and tried to help people as best as he could.{{r|Star-Lord #8}} Eight months after the Guardians left, they decided to come back in order to examine one artifact they stole from the Chitauri. While they were there, a female accuser named [[Hala (Earth-616)|Hala]] invaded Spartax and started destroying the planet in retaliation of Peter's supposed participation in the destruction of the Kree planet, Hala.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 1}}

The female accuser defeated the Guardians and captured Peter, taking him hostage and promising the destruction not only of Spartax but Earth as well.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 3}} He was rescued by the Guardians and together they managed to come back and defeat Hala.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 4}} However, not much later, [[Yotat (Earth-616)|Yotat the Destroyer]] appeared and contributed to further damaging Spartax. The Guardians could defeat him but plenty of damage was done and the people no longer trusted Peter. His delegates took advantage of this and ousted him from power, claiming he should answer for all the destruction caused on his watch. Peter escaped with Kitty and rejoined the Guardians, once again, as a wanted man.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 5}}

===Grounded===
Following a handful of misadventures, the Guardians traveled to [[Earth]] at the request of their friend [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] to help her during the [[Civil War II|second superhuman civil war]], fighting on her behalf against the forces that opposed her led by Iron Man.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 10}} During the ensuing battle, the Guardian's [[Cool Interstellar Travel Travelship|ship]] was destroyed, leaving them stranded on Earth.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 12}} To make matters worse, Thanos was imprisoned on Earth during this time, and Captain Marvel decided to share that information solely with Star-Lord to make him know she would keep that information from Gamora and Drax.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 11}} When Gamora found out about Thanos' whereabouts and refused to align herself with Star-Lord again, Quill decided to come clean and share that information with the rest of his teammates. However, the damage had been done, and both Rocket and Drax decided to walk away.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 13}} The Guardians went their separate ways, but the team was eventually reformed when Thanos invaded Earth. After defeating the Mad Titan and leaving him to the recently reinstated Nova Corps, the Guardians left the Earth on a makeshift ship built by Rocket.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 19}}

===Infinity Countdown===
The wounds of the previous betrayal didn't entirely heal, so the Guardians considered disbanding after carrying out a mission on the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]]'s behalf.{{r|All-New Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 2}} Before getting caught up in a brotherly reunion between the Grandmaster and the Collector,{{r|All-New Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 10}} the rest of the Guardians learned from Gamora that she was trying to find the [[Soul Stone]]. A portion of her soul remained trapped within it, and Gamora wanted to free it.{{r|All-New Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 6}} When the Grandmaster and the Collector determined finding the missing Infinity Stones could help them uncover the secrets of the universe, Gamora convinced her teammates to help the two Elders and search for the gems, since doing so aligned with her mission, and also because possessing the Infinity Stones was a benefit on itself.{{r|All-New Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 10}}

After helping the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]] defend the [[Power Stone]] which had manifested in the planet [[Xitaung]], which resulted in a fight during which Ant-Man became missing in action,{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 #1|4}} the Guardians took off with it and they were approached by Adam Warlock and Kang the Conqueror, who had joined forces to find the [[Time Stone]] and already had the [[Soul Stone]] in their possession. Gamora attempted to force Warlock to hand over the Soul Stone, and a fight broke out. During the battle, Drax managed to hold it, but was exposed to the corruption of Soulworld. He struck Gamora to prevent her from opening the gem, and departed with Warlock and Kang. In addition to Drax's betrayal, the other Guardians refused to follow Gamora into pursuing Kang. Outraged by her teammates' behavior, Gamora left them to obtain the Soul Stone on her own.{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 5}} This abrupt turn of events prompted Star-Lord to declare that the Guardians of the Galaxy were no more.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 1}}

===Infinity Wars===
[[File:Peter Quill (Earth-616) and Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528) from Infinity Wars Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|right|Gamora impaling Star-Lord]]
Under the pretense of agreeing a parley, Gamora met up with Star-Lord and switched the Power Stone in his possession with a fake, while she departed with the real one and encrusted a sword with it.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 1}} Shortly afterwards, the wielder of the [[Time Stone]], [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], convened a meeting between the other parties that possessed Infinity Stones in order to reassemble the [[Infinity Watch (Earth-616)|Infinity Watch]].{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 5}} The conclave was interrupted by Gamora, and Star-Lord tried to calm her down. Claiming that "nothing ever dies," she impaled Peter with her sword to prevent his interference in her mission to claim the Soul Stone.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 1}} Using the Time Stone, Doctor Strange prevented Star-Lord's death. When the conflict ended, Gamora managed to obtain the remaining Infinity Stones.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 2}}

Using the Stones, Gamora folded the universe in half and fused the two halves together to form a pocket universe called [[Warp World]], placing it in Soulworld within the Soul Stone.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 3}} Peter was fused with Groot, becoming the being [[Peet (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Peet]]. When [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] sent a telepathic call to various heroes to aid Adam Warlock in the fight against [[Devondra (Earth-616)|Devondra]], the being that was responsible for Soulworld's corruption, Peet apparently received it. After picking up the Warp World's version of Drax,{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 5}} Peet flew to the battle site, arriving just in time to rescue Gamora, who had been sent into Soulworld by [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]], from being devoured by Devondra.

The [[Cosmic Avengers (Earth-616)|Cosmic Avengers]] eventually arrived with the Infinity Stones. Using the Soul Stone, Adam Warlock separated Peet back into Peter and Groot. Adam and the Cosmic Avengers then recreated the universe while also allowing Warp World to remain in existence. Everyone then fled Soulworld while Drax stayed behind to keep the portal open.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 5|6}}

===Final Gauntlet===
Obtaining a new ship Star-Lord named the [[Ryder (Vehicle)|Ryder]], he and Groot aimlessly wandered space (with Rocket noticeably missing) with Quill becoming depressed over Gamora's betrayal and constantly drowned his sorrow in alcohol. One day, Quill and Groot investigated an energy reading received by a member of the Nova Corps at the site of a meeting being held on Thanos' former ship the Sanctuary. Upon arriving at the location of the reading, they discovered the hammer Stormbreaker pulling out Beta Ray Bill and alternate reality versions of [[Heather Douglas (Earth-18897)|Moondragon]], [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-18897)|Captain Marvel]], and the [[Frank Castle (Earth-TRN666)|Rider]] out of a black hole. Stormbreaker smashed through the Ryder's front window, and Star-Lord and Groot helped pull in everyone in. When the Nova Corps demanded that Star-Lord hand over the beings he rescued, Star-Lord refused and declared that they were his new crew.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 1}}

Ghost Rider later left the team when Quill refused to do anything about Thanos' possible resurrection and joined the [[Dark Guardians (Earth-616)|Dark Guardians]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 2}} Knowing that Gamora was going to be targeted as a possible host for Thanos' resurrection and tired of waiting for Quill to snap out of his apathetic state, Groot took up leadership of the Guardians and piloted the Ryder to [[Halfworld]] where Gamora was so he and the other Guardians could protect her. Quill objected to Groot's mutiny, but Beta Ray Bill forced him to stand down.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 3}}

After a brief confrontation between the newest members of the Guardians and Gamora, Groot convinced Gamora to leave Halfworld and come with the Guardians to protect her from the Dark Guardians. The Guardians later encountered Nova who had come to warn them of the Dark Guardians' intention of killing Gamora. Nova then realized too late that the Dark Guardians had followed him knowing that he would lead them to Gamora. After the Guardians were warned to hand over Gamora, Gladiator damaged the Ryder with an optic blast, forcing to land on an unnamed planet. A fight then ensued between the Dark Guardians and the Guardians, leading to Star-Lord being badly hurt by an out-of-control optic blast from Gladiator.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 4}}

===Master of the Sun===
When the reborn [[Olympians]] began wreaking havoc throughout the universe, Richard Rider interrupted the Guardians' vacation in Halfworld to enlist their help. Half of the Guardians refused out of concern for the team's well-being, emphasized for Gamora's desire to live a new quiet life, but Peter saw himself unable to turn his head away. Alongside Rocket and the alternate Moondragon and Phyla-Vell, Peter joined a ragtag team assembled by Nova to destroy [[New Olympus]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 1}} Although the mission was successful, Star-Lord saw himself forced to manually detonate the black hole, also sending himself and New Olympus outside reality by hijacking the city's dimensional rotor. In the process, both the Element Gun and Peter himself became tangled with the Dark Olympian's power and siphoned power off them.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 2}} Peter was also overtaken by visions of the alien [[Ragnar (Earth-791)|Ragnar]], which seemingly further unlocked powers within Peter and bestowed him the title of Master of the Sun.

On the other side of reality, Quill landed in the world of [[Morinus]], where he encountered two local nomads named [[Mors (Earth-616)|Mors]] and [[Aradia (Earth-616)|Aradia]]. Living unaging in Morinus, Peter acquitted himself with Mors and Aradia as friends and eventually lovers, joining them in mercenary adventures for over a hundred years. The Dark Olympians ultimately escaped from their exile since each use of the Element Gun paved the way for their escape by letting a portion of their power into the world. Using a mystical gateway, Peter returned to his home dimension to lure the Dark Olympians away from Morinus.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 9}} Quill arrived on Spartax, where not much time had passed since Peter's exile. Rejoining the Guardians of the Galaxy, Star-Lord helped fend off the forces of the elder god [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 10}} The Guardians of the Galaxy subsequently prepared for the return of the Dark Olympians, standing their ground on Daedalus 5.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 11}} The heroes were victorious and, in the aftermath of the defeat of the Dark Olympians, the Galactic Council sanctioned them as protectors of the cosmos in light of the increasing uncertainty of the galactic landscape, providing the Guardians with headquarters in the space station [[Proscenium]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 12}}

| Powers                  = '''Enhanced Human/Spartax Physiology''': While Star Lord's history seems to have been reinvented a lot since his first introduction. In current continuity Quill possesses a hybrid nature due to having parentage hailing from alien royalty as well as human originality.{{r|Marvel NOW! Point One Vol 1 1}} He'd also undergone some minor cybernetic enhancements during the annihilation war which were later removed after serving his internment sentence.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord Vol 1 1}} After a harsh battle with the cosmic incarnation of Olympian Gods, Quill ended up using his Element Gun to siphon their power into himself and the Spartaxian weapon. Seemingly giving him all new powers and abilities yet to be explored.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 9}}
* '''Semi-Immortality:''' Spartax may have life spans that are somewhat longer than those of normal humans from Earth. Due to his hybrid nature it is unsure how he will age, but it will likely be at a decelerated rate. After having literally stolen fire from the gods through his assault battery, Quills' life-force had increased to the point he hadn't aged for over a hundred years since landing in an entirely foreign plane of existence.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 9}}
* '''Enhanced Human Condition'''
** '''Superhuman Durability''': To an unknown degree, Peter's resistance to injury had been increased dramatically. Having taken the full brunt of the weakened Gods of Olympus' might and still lived through it.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 9}}
** '''Enhanced Reflexes:''' Peter's reflexes and reaction time allow him to react at a speed that is beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete. He has dodged a Phalanx infected Blastaar's energy blast at short range.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 3}}
