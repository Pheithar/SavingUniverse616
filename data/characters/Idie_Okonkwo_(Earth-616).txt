===Origin===
Idie (Pronounced "Ih-Dyay") was a fourteen year-old{{r|X-Men: Schism #1}} girl living with her family in [[Nigeria]], in [[Delta State]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men #528}} or in [[Oyo (City)|Oyo]], in [[Oyo State]], when her [[Homo superior|mutant powers]] manifested. She was located by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] using [[Cerebra]].{{r|X-Men: Second Coming #2}} With the advent of her mutant abilities, Idie accidentally burned down her village and killed her family. A paramilitary group that tracked down Idie attempted to murder her, but the arrival of [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]] and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] prevented the troops from harming her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #528}}

===The Five Lights===
[[File:Hope Summers (Earth-616) and Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616) from Generation Hope Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Idie and Hope speaking en route to [[Tokyo]].]]
Idie, with no living family left, joined Hope and the other [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]] as they continued to rescue the last two Lights. First traveling with [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], Hope and the Lights across [[Europe]] and finally to [[Florida (State)|Florida]] while tracking [[Teon Macik (Earth-616)|Teon]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #529}} Later the group traveled to [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] to stop [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Kenji]]'s rampage. Though nervous, Idie stood with Hope in defiance of [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]' orders.{{r|Generation Hope #1|4}}

Once the Lights arrived on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], Idie quietly submitted to [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Doctor Nemesis]]' tests and to Hope's training.{{r|Generation Hope #5}} Idie also quietly accompanied Hope and the other Light on their first mission to [[Berlin]] to find a [[Sixth Light (Earth-616)|new mutant]].{{r|Generation Hope #6|7}}

===Schism===
Wolverine took a liking to Idie and started to mentor her. She was at the [[Museum of Mutant History]] when the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] attacked. Cyclops told her to "do what she thought was necessary". Idie decided it was necessary to stop them, and so killed them with her powers.{{r|X-Men: Schism #1|3}}{{r|Generation Hope #10}} 

===Regenesis===
After the events of Schism, Idie went with Wolverine to [[Westchester County]]{{r|X-Men: Schism #5}} to attend [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #1}} Later on she left the  school and joined the [[Hellfire Academy (Earth-616)|Hellfire Academy]] for the sole purpose of finding out who shot [[Broo (Earth-616)|Broo]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #29}}

===Hellfire Academy===
While attending the [[Hellfire Academy (Earth-616)|Hellfire Academy]], Idie caught the eye of [[Kade Kilgore (Earth-616)|Kade Kilgore]]. Kade wanted to make Idie the new [[Black Queen]] of the Hellfire Club and his girlfriend. While changing into her new Black Queen outfit, Idie asked who was the one responsible for shooting [[Broo]]. Kade replied that it was he who had shoot Broo in the head.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #34}} Idie then attacked Kade and attempted to escape the Hellfire Academy along side [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]] and [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 #35}}

===Krakoa===
Idie became a resident of the mutant nation of Krakoa, living at the [[Akademos Habitat]] alongside other young mutants. While showing the new developments in Krakoa to Broo, they stopped by the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]]' house where Broo noticed they had a [[King Egg]], and explained to them that the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] would go to war with them for the egg. As he was explaining the situation to them, a Brood-infested [[Acanti]] fell on Krakoa and the Brood started their attack on the island. Idie was instructed to get the younger mutants to safety by [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Dani Moonstar]].{{r|X-Men Vol 5 8}}

[[File:Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616) from Generation Hope Vol 1 10 0001.png|thumb|200px|right|Idie Okonkwo using her [[Glossary:Thermokinesis|temperature control powers]]]]
Idie is one of post-[[Decimation|M-Day]] [[Homo superior|mutant]] activations. Her powers include:
*'''[[Glossary:Thermokinesis|Thermokinesis]]:''' Idie has the ability to alter temperatures around her. However, she cannot simply create heat and cold; she can only rechannel temperature,{{r|Generation Hope #4}}<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=%2029442 X-POSITION: Kieron Gillen]</ref> thus, she needs presence of heat to generate cold, and vice versa.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 6}} These temperature manipulation powers result in:
**'''[[Pyrokinesis]]:''' Idie is capable of generating flames from thin air, not requiring the consumption of oxygen or combustible objects to maintain the flames.
**'''[[Cryokinesis]]:''' Idie is able to reduce the kinetic energy of atoms and thus reduce temperature, often used to generate ice.
That status of post-[[M-Day]] activated mutant gave her also the following characteristic:
*'''Lights Bonding:''' The Lights were shown to be linked each other, to [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]] and to the new activation's, with some low level control from Hope over them. They were also affected by the suicide of [[Zeeshan (Earth-616)|Zeeshan]].{{r|Generation Hope #9}} That situation was witnessed by [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Transonic]] and [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Zero]],{{r|Generation Hope #8}} and later by [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]].{{r|Generation Hope #12}} Also, when the [[Sixth Light (Earth-616)|Sixth Light]] activated, all of the Lights were able to sense it.{{r|Generation Hope #6}}

*'''Opposing Temperature Dependence:''' She needs fire to make ice and she needs ice to make fire.

| Notes                   = 
* Idie is Catholic,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #528}}{{r|Generation Hope #8}} from the [[Wikipedia:Igbo people|Igbo people]] of [[Nigeria]], but doesn't consider herself still part of her people.{{r|Generation Hope #8}}
* Idie is the youngest of the [[Lights (Earth-616)|Five Lights]]. However, her exact age seemed to be a point of some confusion. In her original appearance Idie is said to only be 12 years old,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #528}} but just a short time later [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] stated she is 14 years old,{{r|Generation Hope #5}} as well as [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Doctor Nemesis]],{{r|Generation Hope #6}} [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Transonic]],{{r|Generation Hope #11}}{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}} and she confirmed it herself.{{r|X-Men: Schism #1}}
* During the Hellfire Club's attack on the Mutant History Museum, she killed at least a dozen men to save herself, other mutants and civilians in the museum much to [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s anger.{{r|X-Men: Schism Vol 1 3}}
* Idie appeared to have lost faith in God to some degree, stating that she no longer "talks" to him, but "yells" at him.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 6}}
| Trivia                  = 
* Idie's name is pronounced "Ih-Dyay" and not "Eye-Dee" as is commonly thought. 
* Idie's last name is likely a reference to the protagonist of ''Things Fall Apart'' Okonkwo. 
* Creators [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Kieron Gillen]] loosely based the [[Lights (Earth-616)|Five Lights]] mutant powers on the the archetypal power-sets on the original five [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] (with the exception of [[Gabriel Cohuelo (Earth-616)|Gabriel]]).<ref>[https://www.cbr.com/x-position-kieron-gillen-3/ X-POSITION: Kieron Gillen]</ref>
**[[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] = [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Laurie Tromette]] 
**[[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] = [[Teon Macik (Earth-616)|Teon Macik]]
**[[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] = Idie Okonkwo
**[[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]] = [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Kenji Uedo]]
* After months of cover art and promotional's depicting her hair in different styles, Idie finally changed her hair from a tight braided style into an afro in {{cl|Generation Hope #8}}. 
* Idie's field name is labeled after Yorùbá deity ''[[Oya (Vodū) (Earth-616)|Oya]]'' (Pronounced "Aw-Yah") who is the Òrìshà of the wind and all standing water bodies.
