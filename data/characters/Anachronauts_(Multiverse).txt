| HistoryText             = [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]]'s handpicked commandos, the greatest warriors of all the ages, Kang was the only man to have defeated them in battle, and thus they swore loyalty to him as the Anachronauts.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 21}}

When the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] ([[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]], [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]], [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], and [[Sersi (Earth-616)|Sersi]]) and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] ([[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]], [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]], [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]], and the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]]) battled each other in [[Chronopolis]], the Anachronauts were sent to deal with the intruders. The Anachronauts battled the two groups of champions, eventually causing them to surrender. However, they did not realize that Sersi had disguised herself as [[Raa (Earth-616)|Raa]], and that the heroes had allowed themselves to be taken captive in order to be taken to Kang. After Kang had revealed his plans to the heroes and confronted [[Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-6311)|Terminatrix]], Sersi revealed herself and freed the other heroes. The two groups then quickly dispatched the Anachronauts.

The Anachronauts were training and facing each other in mock combat. Then [[Sir Raston (Earth-616)|Sir Raston's]] [[Ebony Blade]] began to glow and lost its solidity. [[Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-6311)|Terminatrix]] determined that this was a result of a temporal anomaly which had the Blade never be created. The erasing of the Blade from history had far reaching consequences and threatened Chronopolis itself. The Anachronauts time traveled back to the days of [[Camelot]] to undo the anomaly. They found that the Incinerators, a robotic race, had also time traveled back to Camelot and captured the Star-Stone. The Star-Stone provided the material that was used to forge the Blade. With the help of fellow time traveler [[Justin Alphonse Gamble (Earth-616)|Justin Alphonse Gamble]], the Anachronauts defeated the Incinerators and captured the Star-Stone. Gamble made sure that the Stone would pass to the hands of [[Merlyn (Otherworld)|Merlin]] who would create the Blade.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 22}}

Gamble indicated that he was already familiar with Terminatrix and the Anachronauts through an unrecorded adventure. It took place in his past and in their future.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 22}}

Terminatrix took control of Chronopolis and the rest of Kang's empire, impersonating Kang. As a result, [[Deathunt 9000 (Earth-928)|Deathhunt 9000]] announced that he and his team were quitting. Explaining that they had sworn to serve Kang and only Kang, not the Terminatrix. If Kang returned, he would know where (and when) to find them. Terminatrix threatened that, if the Anachronauts revealed her true identity, she would kill them and all their divergent selves. Deathhunt took it in stride and promised to do the same to her if she failed to look after Kang's empire properly.{{r|Avengers: The Terminatrix Objective Vol 1 1}}

[[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]], disguised as Kang, later tricked several of the Anachronauts into assisting him. Kang soon reasserted his control over the Anachronauts.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 1}} During the events of [[Crossing]], [[Apocryphus (Earth-1952)|Apocryphus]] served "Kang" (Immortus). A chronal weapon was used to erase the country of [[Vietnam]] from the [[Glossary:Timestream|timestream]]. Apocryphus led a team of generic soldiers to investigate the country to see if it worked. They discovered a boy called Kim who was mutated by the weapon. Apocryphus was pleased as they were after specimens like Kim. He intended to recruit the boy.{{r|Force Works Vol 1 17}} 

[[Force Works (Earth-616)|Force Works]] ([[Moonraker (Earth-616)|Moonraker]], [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], and [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]]) and their pilot [[Fisher Todd (Earth-616)|Fisher Todd]] landed in Vietnam. They attracted the attention of Apocryphus. The team located the Temple of Agaphaur, a holy place of the [[Priests of Pama (Earth-616)|Priests of Pama]]. There Moonraker recalled his past life as [[Gustav Brandt (Earth-616)|Gustav Brandt]]. Apocryphus and his soldiers attacked them. They had the upper hand until Moonraker sees them about to hurt his lover Spider-Woman. He attacked Apocryphus and knocked him out. Apocryphus' soldiers run away, leaving Force Works victorious.{{r|Force Works Vol 1 18}} Moonraker took a temporal activator from one of Apocryphus' fallen soldiers. He used it to transport himself and his friends to the [[Works]]. They left behind Kim and an unconscious Apocryphus. Scarlet Witch assumed Apocryphus to be dead, though it was unlikely an  [[Eternals (Race)|Eternal]] could die so easily. Or stay dead for that matter.{{r|Force Works Vol 1 19}}

Elsewhere, Deathunt 9000 was also busy with serving "Kang" (Immortus). He led the Strike Fireteam Decimal Four, a group of six cyborg soldiers, in tracking down the fugitive [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkey]]. A corrupted [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] had asked them to do so. They found their target in the company of [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] and [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)| U.S. Agent]]. Deathhunt attacked and defeated both Hawkeye and the Agent. But then [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] arrived and turned the tide of the battle. He single-handedly killed the cyborgs and defeated Deathhunt. To avoid capture and interrogation, Deathhunt used a "temportal" (temporal portal) to escape.{{r|War Machine Vol 1 21}}

The Anachronauts defended Chronopolis against the invading forces of [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]]. A "time-twisting explosion" killed most of the team, leaving only temporal shadows of the dead. Only an injured [[Wildrun (Earth-616)|Wildrun]] seems to have survived.{{r|Avengers: Forever Vol 1 3}}

Another version of the team. was used by an alternate [[Nathaniel Richards (Earth-12498)|Nathaniel Richards]] to try and kill his [[Nathaniel Richards (Earth-616)|Earth-616 counterpart]] and his allies. None of these Anachronauts were named.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 582}}
