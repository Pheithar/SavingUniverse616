| History                 = N'astirh was a demon who helped [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]] get her baby back from [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Sinister]], and then fought the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #240}}

During ''Inferno'', he decided to send a demon to possess the body of [[Hobgoblin]], thus creating [[Demogoblin (Earth-616)|Demogoblin]].{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #147}}

He was supposedly killed by a lightning bolt from [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #241}}

However a demon called N'astirh later appeared in New X-Men alongside [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] and it is assumed that it is the same demon.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #41}}

During the [[Second Coming]] event, N'astirh and S'ym cut a deal with [[Bastion]]'s forces and provided them with a "weaponized ritual" that sent Magik back to Limbo. When the X-Men sent a team to rescue her, S'ym and N'astirh approached [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] to make another deal: if Pixie would kill Magik, and take her Soulsword to N'astirh, he would return the missing piece of Pixie's soul and free her from Limbo's darkness forever.{{r|X-Men: Hellbound #1|3}}

| Powers                  = N'stirh can fly using his wings, for an undefined period of time. His body is highly resilient to superhuman attacks. He can inflict serious injuries with his claws.{{Citation}}

'''Techno-organic Nature''': The [[Techno-Organic Virus|Transmode Virus]] grants N'astirh the ability to alter his own shape; infect others with the virus, converting them into "techno-organic" beings; absorb the life energy from converted beings, after which they crumble into inert dust.{{Citation}}

| Abilities               = N'astirh is a sorcerer, self-taught in the arts of black magic. His sorcery is said to nearly be as powerful as Belasco and have the potential to rival Illyana Rasputin (Magik) in Limbo.{{Citation}}

| Notes                   = * A demon of similar appearance named "N'astirh" has shown up with the soulless [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]]. This new N'astirh seems to have limited intelligence, and it's unclear whether or not it's the same demon.{{Citation}}
