===Origin===
[[File:Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616) from Avengers Academy Vol 1 3 0003.jpg|thumb|Jennifer|left|Boyfriend in a Coma]]One day, Jennifer was kissing her boyfriend Greg when he suddenly fell into a coma. She was taken to the hospital to be tested where it was discovered that her body leaked radiation and she was the cause of the coma.{{r|Avengers Academy #3}}

While her parents were accusing [[Roxxon]] of being responsible, she herself was accused by Greg's parents. Meanwhile, she was asked to write her stories by countless media.{{r|Avengers Academy #3}}

[[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] kidnapped Jenny and jump-started her powers against her will. When she returned home her family became exposed to her long enough that they became ill and her dog died. [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]] met with Jenny and invited her to the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]]. Hazmat was forced to wear a protective radiation suit at all times when around others.{{r|Avengers Academy #1}}

===Avengers Academy=== 
[[File:Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616) from Avengers Academy Vol 1 33.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Hazmat as a member of Avengers Academy]]
Jennifer was recruited into the newly formed [[Avengers Academy]] alongside other young potential heroes [[Madeline Berry (Earth-616)|Veil (Madeline Berry)]], [[Brandon Sharpe (Earth-616)|Striker (Brandon Sharpe)]], [[Jeanne Foucault (Earth-616)|Finesse (Jeanne Foucault)]], [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-616)|Reptil (Humberto Lopez)]], and [[Ken Mack (Earth-616)|Mettle (Ken Mack)]]. She and the rest of the class were lead to believe they were among those most likely to become heroes, but they quickly uncovered files on them revealed they were most likely to become villains.{{r|Avengers Academy #1}}

Hazmat plotted her revenge on Osborn along with fellow students Mettle and Veil. The three went to the [[Raft]] with the help of the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]]. Hazmat found Norman's cell and she and Mettle tried to kill him. The instructors foiled them and they went back to the [[Quinjet]] where [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] told her, Mettle, and Veil about Osborn killing his family.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 3|4}}

Later the team went out with Mettle and Hazmat shrunk onto Wasp's hand. [[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Whirlwind]] appeared and attacked a guy, and the team used their powers to defeat Whirlwind, but in doing so become public.{{r|Avengers Academy #5}}

After being elected class leader of Avengers Academy, Reptil decided to mediate Mettle and Hazmat's differences, saying that they make a good couple, they became disgusted. Mentallo escaped from his transport truck and started messing with the Avengers. The team went to intervene, resulting in Reptil ripping his arm off.{{r|Avengers Academy #6}}

===Final Exam===
Mettle and Hazmat were at the beach, but their unusual appearances make it hard for them to enjoy it. Hazmat received a call. They traveled to the [[Briggs Chemical LLC (Earth-616)|Briggs Building]] to meet their former teammate Veil, who was working with another subject of Osborn's experiments, [[Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616)|Jeremy Briggs]]. He had been working on a cure for all their conditions. The couple decided that to take his clean slate process which restored them to their normal forms. Free from their deformities, the couple went out to enjoy life as normal people.{{r|Avengers Academy #34}}

Jeremy Briggs however revealed his true plan to to Veil and Striker: To remove all superpowered beings' powers only allowing the worthy to possess them. Veil ran to tell Mettle and Hazmat and persuaded them to take the so-called antidote and restore their powers for good. Mettle and the group confronted Jeremy and his accomplice, the [[Sylvie Lushton (Earth-616)|Enchantress (Sylvie Lushton)]], on the rooftop of his building.{{r|Avengers Academy #35}} 

[[Ava Ayala (Earth-616)|White Tiger]] and Reptil drew on the full power of their magic, gaining an extreme upper hand on the Enchantress. Sensing her defeat, she teleported away but not before getting her face slashed by White Tiger.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 36}} [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] did some slicing and dicing of Briggs, releasing an acid attack on her stomach, destroying it in the process. Finesse noticed this as the perfect opportunity to use X-23's hands as weapons. Finesse grabbed X-23's wrists, and stabbed two of Briggs' most important arteries. As he sat bleeding to death, freaking out, Finesse started stemming the loss of blood by cutting off the flow. Finesse reminded Briggs about why they were recruited: they were at risk of becoming villains. As she explained this, she untied the cloth that had been keeping Briggs from bleeding to death, and walked off leaving him to  die.

In the aftermath, Hazmat told Mettle that killing Briggs was completely worth it, and that she had no remorse.{{r|Avengers Academy #37}} 

===Avengers Arena===
Hazmat is one of the 16 super powered teens teleported to [[Murderworld]] by [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]]. Hazmat and Mettle had just had sex for the first time when they were teleported away from Avengers Academy. In Murderworld, Arcade was about to kill a defiant Hazmat, but Mettle sacrificed himself in Jen's place and was killed by Arcade instead.{{r|Avengers Arena #1}}

Hazmat teamed up with fellow Avengers Academy members X-23 and Reptil, and only briefly with the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]] [[Chase Stein (Earth-616)|Chase]] and [[Nico Minoru (Earth-616)|Nico]]. Her teammate Reptil was badly injured by a mysterious attacker. Hazmat and X-23 mistakenly blamed Chase and Nico, destroying their food source. Later, Hazmat stepped on a trap set by Arcade which caused X-23's [[Trigger 42|trigger scent]] to spread among her party. X-23 was affected by it and attacked the injured Reptil and Hazmat. Reptil transforms into a winged dinosaur form and carried Hazmat away from X-23's attack to a beach sector of Murderworld. She and Reptil stayed on the beach where he recovered until a group of other contestants were teleported by Nico to their destination. Reptil convinced Hazmat to join the fight against [[Katy & Timothy Bashir (Earth-616)|Apex]], who had been murdering the other young heroes on the island.

On the last day in Murderworld, Hazmat's powers went haywire.{{r|Avengers Arena #17}} She began to emit a great amount of radiation and could control it. As she cried out for help, Reptil, in dinosaur form, scooped Hazmat up in his mouth and leaped into the water. A massive underwater explosion occurred. After the teen's battle against the island itself, Hazmat crawled onto the beach, out of her containment suit and no longer glowing. She convinced the other survivors to make a pact to never talk about what happened in Murderworld.{{r|Avengers Arena #18}}

===Avengers Undercover===
Three months after leaving Murderworld, now without her containment suit and in control of her powers, Hazmat found herself on another mission.{{r|Avengers Undercover #1}} She, Nico, Chase, [[Aiden Gillespie (Earth-616)|Aiden]], [[Camille Benally (Earth-616)|Cammi]], and [[Rebecca Ryker (Earth-616)|Death Locket]] went to [[Bagalia]] to locate [[Cullen Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Cullen]], who was searching for Arcade. After finding Cullen, the seven of them are teleported by the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] to a Murderworld-based event being held at Arcade's Massacrer Casino.{{r|Avengers Undercover #3}} Hazmat, upon discovering Arcade, suddenly experienced a state of catatonic shock. During the slaughter, Arcade mocked Nico, Chase, Cullen, Aiden, Cammi, and Death Locket for being unwilling to kill him. Hazmat suddenly recovered from her shock and blasted Arcade with radiation, seemingly frying him to death.

[[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] invited the seven Murderworld survivors to stay in Bagalia and join the Masters of Evil.{{r|Avengers Undercover #4}} Hoping to restore their image as heroes, Hazmat and the others devised a plan decide to stay in Bagalia and secretly take down the Masters of Evil from the inside.{{r|Avengers Undercover #5}} 

Months later, [[Giuletta Nefaria (Earth-616)|Madame Masque]] had Hazmat and Aiden accompany her on a mission [[Madripoor]] to meet with [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] and [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]]. There, Madame Masque trained Hazmat and Aiden by having them fight [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] ninjas. Afterwards, Hazmat and Aiden watched the sunset together, and Aiden surprised Jennifer by kissing her.{{r|Avengers Undercover #8}} 

After Cammi foiled Baron Zemo and the Masters of Evil's plans, Hazmat and the others left Bagalia. Hazmat rejoins her friends from Avengers Academy, [[Braddock Academy]], and the Runaways, and together they went to enjoy summertime at a lake.{{r|Avengers Undercover #10}}
