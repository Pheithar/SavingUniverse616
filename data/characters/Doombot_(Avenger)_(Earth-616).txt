When a new A.I. threat calling itself [[Dimitrios (Earth-616)|Dimitrios]] surfaced, Dr. Pym decided to create a special [[Avengers Artificial Intelligence Squad (Earth-616)|A.I. division of the Avengers]]. In addition to [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] and [[Victor Mancha (Earth-616)|Victor Mancha]], Pym added Doombot to the roster.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 1}}

As part of the Avengers A.I. Squad, Doombot helped rescue [[Alexis (Earth-616)|Alexis]] in [[Atlanta]],{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 1}} defeat a [[Kilgore Sentinel (Earth-616)|Sentinel]] attacking the [[Washington Monument]],{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 2|3}} and infiltrate [[Diamond (City)|The Diamond]].{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 5}}{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 8.NOW|12}} During his time with the Avengers A.I., Doombot became close friends with Victor Mancha.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 2|5}}{{r|Runaways Vol 5 9}}

Following the death of Pym and the disbanding of the Avengers A.I. team, the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] seemingly lost track of Doombot.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 11}} When Doombot learned of the "death"{{r|Vision Vol 2 11}} and reactivation of Victor Mancha,{{r|Runaways Vol 5 3}} he traveled to the [[Hostel (Bronson Canyon)|Hostel]] where Victor lived with the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]] to offer to create him a new body.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 9}} Despite the quality of a body Doombot provided Victor, the teenager had become traumatized by the events that had led to his deactivation so he turned it down.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 11}}

When the Runaways celebrated Christmas, they invited Doombot.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 16}} During this time, the Runaways had become besieged by the children of the [[Gibborim]], and one of the Gibborim left by his nestmates to guard the Runaways, [[Gib (Earth-616)|Gib]], attacked and thrashed Doombot.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 17}} After turning against his nestmates and following their defeat, Gib warned the Runaways that he had destroyed Doombot.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 18}} [[Chase Stein (Earth-616)|Chase Stein]] worked on fixing Doombot and removed the micro black hole, which prompted the robot to become violent when he was reactivated. Victor, who had regrown his body, wired himself to Doombot.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 22}} Finding himself inside Doombot's mind, Victor managed to convince him not to resume his old programming just because his kill switch had been removed, but to embrace his uniqueness and his benevolence.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 23}}

Although he turned down Victor's offer to move to the Hostel,{{r|Runaways Vol 5 25}} Doombot eventually changed his mind after the Runaways had a run-in with [[Los Angeles]] hero [[Doc Justice (Earth-616)|Doc Justice]] and became their sidekicks only to discover that he routinely had his protégés killed for publicity. Once the Runaways returned to the Hostel, Doombot invited himself in to keep an eye on Victor and his teammates for their safety.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 32}}
