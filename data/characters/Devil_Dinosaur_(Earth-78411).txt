===Origin===
Devil is a [[Dinosaurs|dinosaur]] from [[Earth|"Dinosaur World"]] of [[Earth-78411]], a primitive reality in the past.{{r|Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 1}}

The young Devil Dinosaur was nearly burned to death by a tribe of Killer-Folk, hostile beings native to his planet, but was rescued by [[Moon-Boy (Earth-78411)|Moon-Boy]], a young member of a rival tribe, the [[New Folk|Small-Folk]]. Exposure to the Killer-folk's fire activated a [[Mutant|mutation]] in the dinosaur which gave him powers greater than others of his species and turned his skin from olive green to flame red. Devil Dinosaur was fiercely loyal to his constant companion Moon-Boy and seemed more intelligent than the average dinosaur.{{Citation}}

===Time in Dinosaur World===
[[File:Devil Dinosaur (Earth-78411) and Moon Boy (Earth-78411) from Avengers The Initiative Featuring Reptil Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Devil Dinosaur and Moon-Boy]]
The pair had several adventures on Dinosaur World, including avenging the death of Devil's family by the Killer-Folk,{{r|Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 1|2}} stopping [[Sky-Demons|an alien invasion]] that would have wiped out all of Moon-Boy's people,{{r|Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 4|5}} and destroying the [[Prime Computer (Earth-78411)|Prime Computer]], which had imprisoned a trio of New Folk in a mini-paradise and away from harm; however, it failed at this and was destroyed when Devil freed them.{{r|{{cl|Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 6}}-[[Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 7|7]]}} This time also included his first visit to [[Earth-616]] when he fell into one of the pits guarded by [[Hag of the Pits (Earth-78411)|Hag of the Pits]], which triggered a portal and he ended up in [[Zuma City]], [[Nevada (State)|Nevada]]. The locals began attacking him, but he was returned to Dinosaur World with the help of Moon-Boy and the Hag.{{r|Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 9}}

At some point, young [[Celestials]] transported the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] back in time to combat Devil as well.{{r|Marvel Monsters: Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 1}}

===Encountering Godzilla===
After [[Godzilla (Earth-616)|Godzilla]] went on rampages throughout Earth, in an attempt to stop the monster, [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] shrank Godzilla with [[Pym Particles]] and attempted to teleport him via a time machine to the prehistoric past; however, Godzilla's radiation distorted the time machine so that he was transported to the alternate universe of Dinosaur World instead. While there, he briefly united with Moon-Boy and Devil Dinosaur against a common foe, [[Lizard Warriors]] before being pulled back to his home universe.{{r|Godzilla Vol 1 21|22}}

In a nod to the Godzilla rampage, [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|The Thing]] of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] traveled to an island in the [[Pacific Ocean]] where "Devil Dinosaur: The Movie" was being produced. During the Thing's visit, Godzilla appeared, battling and destroying a robot Devil Dinosaur used in the film. Godzilla then disappeared once again into the ocean.{{r|Thing Vol 1 31}}

===The Fallen Angels===
[[Ariel (Coconut Grove) (Earth-616)|Ariel]], an [[Non-Human Mutants#Coconut Grove|extraterrestrial mutant]] with teleportation powers, teleported the [[Fallen Angels (Earth-616)|Fallen Angels]] to Dinosaur World where the group convinced Devil and Moon-Boy to join their team and return with them to Earth-616. Devil and Moon-Boy were later returned to their own universe when the Fallen Angels disbanded.{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 1 4|8}}

===Other Adventures===
During a conflict between [[Steven Harmon (Earth-616)|Slapstick]] and his time manipulating foe, [[Doctor Yesterday (Earth-616)|Doctor Yesterday]], Devil and Moon-Boy were briefly teleported to Earth-616.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 161}}

Sometime later, in the midst of a tussle between [[Technet (Multiverse)|Technet]] and [[Lockheed (Earth-616)|Lockheed]] inside [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]]'s [[Braddock Lighthouse|lighthouse]], Devil and Moon-Boy were once again briefly transported to Earth-616.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 174}}

The sorceress [[Jennifer Kale (Earth-616)|Jennifer Kale]], in an attempt to return [[Howard the Duck (Earth-791021)|Howard the Duck]] to his [[Earth-791021|homeworld]], inadvertently teleported Devil Dinosaur and Moon-Boy into her [[New York City|New York]] apartment. The disoriented dinosaur rampaged through the city before being subdued by [[Noble Kale (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]].{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 81|82}}

At a certain moment of time back on Dinosaur World, a renegade [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrull]] fled to Devil's planet, and used his shape-shifting abilities to impersonate the late leader of the Killer-Folk, [[Seven-Scars (Earth-78411)|Seven-Scars]].{{r|Devil Dinosaur Spring Fling Vol 1 1}}

Meanwhile, stranded in modern day Earth-616 after their teleportation there by Jennifer Kale, the Devil Dinosaur and Moon-Boy were hypnotized into joining the [[Circus of Crime (Earth-616)|Circus of Crime]]. After being rescued by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], the pair were relocated to the [[Savage Land]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 1998}}

The pair were still in the Savage Land of Earth-616 when it came under attack by [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]] and [[Parnival Plunder (Earth-616)|The Plunderer]]. They teamed up with Ka-Zar and the other Savage land residents to fend them off.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 2 5|7}}

===Moon-Boy's Abduction===
The [[Heroes for Hire (Knight & Wing) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]] mercenaries went on a mission for S.H.I.E.L.D. to retrieve Moon-Boy from the Savage Land and encountered Devil Dinosaur in the process. Devil was found fiercely guarding a nest containing a clutch of eggs that apparently he himself had laid and the dinosaur abandoned Moon-Boy to ensure their safety. The discrepancy between this development and his previously presumed male sex was noted by the mercenaries, who could only speculate as to the cause of the change.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 1 9|10}} After returning to the U.S. the Heroes for Hire disbanded and [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]] left alone with Moon-Boy to collect the reward from the S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists who hired the mercenaries.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 1 15}}

===Stegron===
Moon-Boy remained under the custody of S.H.I.E.L.D. for some time, which drove Devil Dinosaur into a sort of saurian depression. Refusing to eat, or defend himself, he was in danger of dying. However, [[Vincent Stegron (Earth-616)|Stegron]] became worried about the survival of the Devil-Beast due to it being the last known of its species. He left the Savage Land and came to the U.S. attacking S.H.I.E.L.D. base until the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] stopped and arrested him. After discovering the motive behind Stegron's plan, they sent [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-616)|Reptil]] to smuggle Moon-Boy back to the Savage Land and to Devil.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil Vol 1 1}}

===Skaar King of the Savage Land===
Devil and Moon-Boy teamed with [[Skaar (Earth-616)|Skaar]] in order to help free [[Shanna O'Hara (Earth-616)|Shanna]] from the mental control of [[Designer (Earth-616)|The Designer]], who at the time was trying to take back control of the Savage Land and destroy everything outside of it. They amassed an army made up the people that had been trapped in a wormhole and defeated the spirit to free Shanna. {{r|Skaar: King of the Savage Land Vol 1}}

===[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]===
Much later a brilliant little girl named [[Lunella Lafayette (Earth-616)|Lunella Lafayette]] was living on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]] in Earth-616 and became obsessed with the [[Kree]], eventually building a device designed to uncover Kree technology, which she used to find an [[Omni-Wave Projector]] hidden beneath the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in the [[Financial District]]. Meanwhile in the [[Valley of the Flame]] on Dinosaur World, a Killer-Folk named [[Thorn-Teeth (Earth-78411)|Thorn-Teeth]] was also revealed to be in possession of an [[Omni-Wave Projector]] they called the Nightstone. Devil and Moon-Boy, who had at some point been returned to their own reality after their time in the Savage Land, attacked their encampment and stole the Nightstone, only for Moon-Boy to be beaten to death by the pursing Killer-Folk. Back on Earth, when one of Lunella's teachers, [[Coach Hrbek (Earth-616)|Coach Hrbek]], accidentally activated Lunella's device, it opened a portal across space and time from Dinosaur World to Earth-616, allowing the Killer-Folk to cross over into present day [[New York City]]. Devil Dinosaur followed, looking to avenge the death of his longtime companion Moon-Boy at the hands of Thorn-Teeth's tribe.{{r|Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 1}}

Upon arrival Devil clenched the strap of Lunella's backpack in his teeth, but she was able to utilize a remote-controlled unmanned aerial vehicle therein to lure him away from the pursing [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]]. Eventually leading Devil Dinosaur to a secluded part of the Lower East Side, she explained to him that she needed the Omni-Wave Projector because she had discovered that she was actually a [[Human-Inhuman Hybrids|Nuhuman]], and she believed that the Kree technology was the key to protecting her from the cloud of [[Terrigen Mist]] circling the planet, and that if she could only study it further, then she would be able to prevent her latent Inhuman DNA from forcing change upon her through [[Terrigenesis]], something she was terrified of. Instructing Devil Dinosaur to stay put, she set off to do just that; however, she was captured by the Killer-Folk, who claimed her Omni-Wave Projector as their own, shortly thereafter.{{r|Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 2}}

Luckily Devil Dinosaur arrived to rescue Lunella from the Killer-Folk, though they were unable to recover the Omni-Wave Projector, as [[Gurf (Earth-78411)|Gurf]] took it and dove into the [[East River]]. Seeing their daughter with a Tyrannosaurus rex on the news the next morning, Mr. and Mrs. Lafayette forbid Lunella from any more after-school activities, and insisted that from now on she take the bus directly home from school. Lunella skipped out on her science class; however, and went to work in her [[Moon Girl's Secret Laboratory|secret lab]] located beneath the school where she'd hidden Devil Dinosaur in hopes of using him to find the Killer-Folk who'd stolen her Omni-Wave Projector. Her work was interrupted by the fire alarm soon thereafter, because [[Character Index/S#Sasha|Sasha]], [[Character Index/L#Lily|Lily]], and another girl had been playing with matches in the girls' restroom, and had set the school on fire. Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur sprang into action, rescuing [[Eduardo (P.S. 20) (Earth-616)|Eduardo]] and the other science class students from the blaze before the [[New York City Fire Department (Earth-616)|FDNY]] arrived. Their heroics would go unrewarded; however, as the [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Hulk]] appeared, seeking to take Devil Dinosaur into custody.{{r|Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 3}}

Hulk blamed Devil Dinosaur for starting the school on fire and, over Lunella's objections, attacked. A fierce battle ensued, with collateral damage resulting in many FDNY fire trucks, and parts of the school, being destroyed. Moon Girl attempted to intervene, but Devil Dinosaur moved to protect her, and was accidentally tased in the process. Hulk seized the advantage and repeatedly slammed Devil Dinosaur into the ground by his tail until he was incapacitated. He then reverted to Amadeus Cho, at which point Lunella pleaded with him to allow her to keep Devil Dinosaur, as she needed him to help recover the Omni-Wave Projector and prevent her potential exposure to Terrigen. Amadeus doubted her intellectual capability to resolve the issue, and turned Lunella over to her parents, who promised to keep her under lock and key from then on, before subsequently chaining Devil Dinosaur with the intent of imprisoning him in his monster collection.{{r|Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 4}}

[[File:Devil Dinosaur (Earth-Unknown) from Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 25 001.jpg|thumb]]

At some point, Devil Dinosaur and [[Lunella Lafayette (Earth-616)|Moon Girl]] teamed-up with [[Gwendolyn Poole (Earth-TRN565)|Gwenpool]] and [[Power Pack (Earth-616)|Power Pack]].{{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 25}}
