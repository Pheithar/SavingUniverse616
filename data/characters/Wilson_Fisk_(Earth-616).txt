===Early Life===
Very little is known about the Kingpin before he first took command of the East Coast mobs. He has described himself, however as having been "an unpopular, blubbery child" before he began his lifelong pursuit of bodybuilding. Wilson Fisk was impoverished as a child, has claimed his father was a crack addict{{r|Kingpin Vol 2 5}} and committed his first murder when he was twelve. From the start, Fisk was determined to be the best in whatever he did, and he believed physical strength to be a major factor in building power in the underworld. Hence, he fanatically trained himself in various methods of bodybuilding and personal combat, finally concentrating on the Japanese art of sumo. His sumo training probably led to his interest in the Orient, which would manifest itself in other ways. In addition to his devotion to physical strength, Fisk realized the importance of intelligence. Being from a poor family, Fisk's formal education was limited. He became self-taught, acquiring or borrowing (or sometimes outright shoplifting) books from libraries or bookstores in whatever he could find. Although Fisk learned a great deal in sciences and arts, he became particularly fascinated by political science. He decided that another key to success would be in using political techniques in organizing and directing groups of criminals.{{citation}} By the age of fifteen, his use of administrative techniques to organize his growing gang of criminals earned him the nickname "Kingpin of Crime."{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report Vol 1 1}}

===Criminal Take-Over===
A young Fisk took control of and merged juvenile gangs who were used to run drugs for the mafia families, started a minor drug war and manipulated two mayoral candidates in an attempt to secure power and connections for himself during which he had his first encounters with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]{{r|Kingpin Vol 2 1|7}} before he began working for [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] boss, [[Don Rigoletto (Original) (Earth-616)|Don Rigoletto]], as his bodyguard and enforcer.{{r|Daredevil: The Man Without Fear Vol 1 3}} During this time, Fisk befriended fellow family member [[Miles Morales (Earth-616)|Miles Morales]], who saved Fisk's life in prison. Since then, Fisk promised to be forever in his debt. With Morales by his side, Fisk took over the [[Rigoletto Crime Family (Earth-616)|operations]] of the [[Don Rigoletto (Successor) (Earth-616)|Don Rigoletto]], and had him killed. Some time after Fisk established his criminal empire, Miles left his side to live a quiet life with his lover. Fisk made the necessary adjustments to erase any records of Morales' criminal life. People also started mockingly calling Fisk the "Kingpin" behind his back, a nickname that became his nom de crime.{{r|Spider-Men II Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Daredevil Vol 1 116.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Wilson Fisk: the Kingpin]]
Fisk was careful to invest his illegal gains in legitimate businesses. The first company which he owned completely was one dealing in spices from the Far East. Today, even though Fisk has built a vast legitimate business empire in various fields, he still professes in public to being merely a "humble dealer in spices."{{citation}}

After about a decade of being a criminal leader, Fisk had also achieved enough success in legitimate business to become a prominent member of New York society. It is at this point that he met and soon married [[Vanessa Fisk (Earth-616)|Vanessa Fisk]], a beautiful woman not yet 20 years old, and whose love, the Kingpin has stated, gave him the peace he sought after his constant struggle for power. Whether or not Vanessa knew of his criminal activities when she married him is unclear; she did know afterward. Their son, [[Richard Fisk (Earth-616)|Richard]], was born within a year after their marriage.{{citation}}

===Spider-Man's Retirement===
About two decades later, Fisk had become one of the most powerful criminal leaders in both the New York and Las Vegas areas and had won the respect of many of the other crime bosses. When the costumed crime fighter [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] briefly retired, the Kingpin decided the time had come to fulfill his master plan. For years various major criminals dreamed of forming a coalition of criminal gangs in order to compete with the [[Maggia]], which virtually monopolized organized crime throughout the country, The Big Man (the late [[Frederick Foswell (Earth-616)|Frederick Foswell]]) had only temporarily succeeded in uniting the independent gangs; others who have tried included the [[Nicholas Lewis, Sr. (Earth-616)|Crime-Master]], [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]], the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|first]] and [[Barton Hamilton (Earth-616)|third]] [[Green Goblin]]s, the [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]], the [[Leland Owlsley (Earth-616)|Owl]], [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]], and [[Silvio Manfredi (Earth-616)|Silvermane]]. With Spider-Man apparently gone, the Kingpin proposed that such a coalition be formed under his leadership, and met with nearly unanimous acceptance. The Kingpin then directed a major crime wave in New York City which came to an end with his first confrontation with the again active Spider-Man. Moreover, the Kingpin's attempt to silence [[Daily Bugle]] publisher [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]] backfired when Spider-Man rescued Jameson, who then publicly exposed Fisk as the Kingpin, which caused the crime coalition to fall apart.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 50|52}}

In the following years the Kingpin suffered a number of reversals. He tried using the brainwashing techniques of [[Gerhard Winkler (Earth-616)|Dr. Winkler]] to cause police chief [[George Stacy (Earth-616)|George Stacy]] to steal important documents, but he was once again foiled by Spider-Man and Stacy was cleared of all charges.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 59|61}} He was then opposed by the Schemer, who turned out to be his own son Richard.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 83|85}}

===Hydra===
He was offered an opportunity to fully achieve his ambitions for political power when he was recruited to serve as the behind the scenes leader of the Las Vegas area faction of the now fragmented [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]. His son, Richard, acted under him as Supreme Hydra of this group. Through Hydra, the Kingpin planned to overthrow the United States government and even achieve world domination, but he turned against Hydra upon learning that the Las Vegas contingent was actually controlled not by him but by the infamous Nazi war criminal, the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]].{{r|Captain America Vol 1 146|148}} Ever since, the Kingpin has pursued more realistic goals than Hydra's.

He hired several goons, including the [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]] to prevent the completion of the [[Worldwide Habitual Offender Computer (Earth-616)|Worldwide Habitual Offender Computer]]{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 153|154}} and had the [[Phineas Mason (Earth-616)|Tinkerer]] rebuild the [[Spider-Mobile]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 159}}

===Retirement to Japan===
Eventually, Vanessa, sickened by the Kingpin's life of crime, demanded that Fisk abandon it or else she would desert him. Unwilling to lose Vanessa, Fisk agreed to her terms, and the two retired to Japan. Vanessa even persuaded the reluctant Fisk to turn over his files on the activities of other leaders of organized crime to American legal authorities. To prevent this, the new leaders of the Kingpin's crime syndicate kidnapped Vanessa, who was then apparently killed by a Kingpin aide who correctly saw her as the only obstacle preventing Fisk from returning to crime.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #197}}{{r|Daredevil #170|171}}

===Criminal Comeback===
The enraged Fisk indeed made a comeback. Not only did he resume leadership of his former organization, but he also turned over his files on other criminal leaders to the law through the costumed crime fighter [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], now with the motive of ridding himself of any rivals. The ploy worked: as a result of the evidence in the files, many criminal leaders, both inside and outside the Maggia, were convicted. In the ensuing power vacuum, the Kingpin rebuilt his coalition, stronger than before. He moved on to control the great majority of non-Maggia East Coast gangs dealing in conventional crimes. The Kingpin's organization became stronger than any single Maggia "family" in the New York area.{{citation}}

===Daredevil===
The Kingpin again turned his attention to his political goals, and his puppet candidate [[Randolph Cherryh (Earth-616)|Councilman Randolph Cherryh]] actually won a New York mayoral election. However, Daredevil, now the Kingpin's principal opponent among the city's costumed adventurers, found Vanessa alive, though suffering from severe mental problems. Daredevil told the Kingpin he would return Vanessa to him if the Kingpin ordered Cherryh to decline to accept the mayoralty. The Kingpin agreed, and the bargain was carried out. Vanessa was returned to the Kingpin's custody as promised. While the Kingpin attempted to get revenge for this disgrace by having Elektra assassinate Matt Murdock's legal partner [[Franklin Nelson (Earth-616)|Foggy Nelson]], it ended in failure when Bullseye killed Elektra.{{r|Daredevil #179|181}}

The Kingpin was angered by Daredevil's various successful attempts at subverting his plans. Finally, [[Karen Page (Earth-616)|Karen Page]], Daredevil's former lover who had become a heroin addict, sold the information that Daredevil was lawyer Matthew Murdock to a drug dealer. The information came into the Kingpin's hands, and he seized the opportunity for vengeance. He arranged for Murdock to be rendered virtually penniless and had him framed for bribing a witness to perjure himself. Murdock lost his license to practice law. Already psychologically troubled, Murdock sank into severe paranoia. He confronted the Kingpin, who savagely beat him and had him trapped, unconscious, within a cab at the bottom of a New York river so Murdock's death would seem an accident. But Murdock managed to escape.{{r|Daredevil #227|230}}

Kingpin made another attempt on Daredevil through [[Mary Walker (Earth-616)|Typhoid Mary]], and succeeded in driving Murdock out of New York for many months.{{r|Daredevil #254|263}} Kingpin attempted to expand his reach into legitimate businesses by acquiring a news network, but had actually been manipulated by Hydra into taking them on as silent partners. Daredevil used these terrorist ties to foul Fisk's reputation in the public eye and among the criminal elite of New York, who began to see Kingpin as the patsy for Hydra. As a series of federal indictments came down against Fisk, Kingpin tried to enact an old plot, recovering a club with Murdock's fingerprints on it used to beat a cabbie to death. In his desperation, however, Fisk ended up in a daylight battle with Daredevil on the streets of New York before finally crumbling under the weight of his charges. Fisk's bail was made by a former crony who wanted to make Fisk beg for him, but Kingpin beat the man to death and then escaped into the sewers, nearly mindless and feral. The broken Fisk seemed to have come full circle from his squalid upbringing.{{r|Daredevil #297|300}}

===Stark-Fujikawa===
Under circumstances to be fully revealed, Fisk became a part of the [[Stark-Fujikawa]] corporate empire, surfacing in an East Asian branch, and wielding power and influence as he had before, although not quite on the same scale/geography. He eventually came up against the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and their erstwhile companion, [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]]. The heroes were hot on the trail of the [[Elixir of Life|Elixir Vitae]] which they thought could be used as a cure for the Legacy Virus. Unfortunately, the information about the Elixir was in the hands of the Kingpin, who wanted to give it up only for its ultimate monetary value. Storm ended up destroying the Elixir rather than to let Fisk get rich off it. Fisk used his position at Stark-Fujikawa to re-establish his empire in New York.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #62|64}}

===Maya Lopez===
[[Maya Lopez (Earth-616)|Maya Lopez]], who he had adopted after killing her father Willie "Crazy Horse" Lincoln (a mob enforcer in his employment), was curious about her father's killer and he took advantage of this to convince her that it had been Daredevil. She confronted Daredevil after studying videos of him fighting to learn his weaknesses and would have killed him had she not recognized him as Matt Murdock due to the shape of a wound on his cheek that she had seen while they were on a date. On talking to him she realized that Fisk had in fact murdered her father himself and attacked him in revenge, temporarily blinding him.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 15}}

===Son's Death===
Wilson Fisk eventually lost his criminal empire to one of his employees, [[Samuel Silke, Jr. (Earth-616)|Samuel Silke]], who was working with his son Richard, in a bloody Caesar-like assassination bid.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 27}} In the aftermath, Vanessa killed Richard{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 31}} and eventually fled the country after selling their real estate and broke up and sold the business off to Fisk's colleagues, she then left with Fisk's remaining wealth{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 36}} while the Kingpin recuperated in the mountains of [[Jabal Katrina]], [[Egypt]], broken and alone.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 46}}

===Hardcore===
Fisk returned once he had healed and had reconstructive surgery to fix his blindness in [[Sweden]], he got revenge on [[Samuel Silke, Jr. (Earth-616)|Silke]] by crushing his head 'like a melon' as well as killing [[Uri Rosenthal (Earth-616)|Uri Rosenthal]] for publishing the story about [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]] being Daredevil. With [[Mary Walker (Earth-616)|Typhoid Mary]] working for him after he forced her Typhoid Mary persona to reemerge Fisk almost managed to regain his empire after sending Mary to attack Daredevil in his civilian persona, setting him on fire in broad daylight as a distraction to Daredevil. 

Fisk then had many of the people who had purchased his territory from his wife killed and sat down with those remaining to tell them he was in charge again, during this meeting he was defeated and beaten unconscious by Daredevil who came after him for sending [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]] to kill him, intending for this to be their final fight. Daredevil then declared himself the new Kingpin and Fisk was put in [[Ryker's Island|Ryker's Island Maximum Security Penitentiary]] where he was visited by [[Maya Lopez (Earth-616)|Maya Lopez]] who confronted him about their relationship.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 #46|53}}

===Murdock Papers===
[[File:Daredevil Vol 2 119 Textless.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Return of the King]]
He hatched a scheme to be freed and regain his wealth by giving the F.B.I. proof in the form of the nonexistent "Murdock Papers" that Matt Murdock is Daredevil. Having made so many enemies who were in prison, Fisk was constantly under attack from the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]], Hydra, or any number of criminal organizations with which he had had intimate contact with. The U.S. Government was hard pressed to get rid of this expensive, dangerous, legally clean master criminal, and Fisk succeeded in manipulating the F.B.I. into gravely wounding Daredevil and directing them to his D.N.A. He told [[Benjamin Urich (Earth-616)|Ben Urich]] to give the feds the location of the [[Linda Carter (Earth-616)|Night Nurse]], the only medic for injured superheroes, or go to jail.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 #77|81}}

He succeeded in getting Matt Murdock finally arrested, but the F.B.I. betrayed him at the last minute and arrested him as well, placing him in the same jail as Murdock with hopes that the two would kill each other. While in jail he also managed to arrange the near-fatal stabbing of [[Franklin Nelson (Earth-616)|Foggy Nelson]], Daredevil's longtime friend and fellow lawyer. Ironically, the enemies were forced to team up in order to survive a prison riot which was directed at them. Finally, Murdock sacrificed the deal, refusing to let [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]], who was also incarcerated, leave the prison as Kingpin had planned. The fight ended with the Kingpin shot point-blank in the knee by gunfire from Bullseye intended for Murdock, while Murdock escaped.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 82|87}}

===Civil War===
During the [[Civil War]] he offered a deal to [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] — consideration on his sentence in exchange for information about [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]'s Resistance base. However, as his status in prison was threatened for collaborating with Stark, he betrayed him. He first set up Iron Man by revealing a gathering of supervillains by [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]] to create a new criminal empire, claiming it was a base of Captain America's, and gave information to the [[Secret Avengers (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] instead.{{r|Civil War: War Crimes Vol 1 1}}

He also put out a hit on Spider-Man and his loved ones. A sniper attempted to hit Spider-Man, only to hit one of the "secondary targets", [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|Aunt May]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 538}}

===Freed===
At some point later, after Matt Murdock returned to America with his name cleared, he completed Vanessa Fisk's last wish and took on Fisk's case, getting all charges dropped in exchange for Fisk leaving the country. Fisk visited his wife's grave.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 93}}

===Runaways===
However, Fisk returned to New York to settle some "old business" and met with the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]], who were on the run from S.H.I.E.L.D. He offered them protection from the government if they promised to steal a special artifact for him. After the teens ran into a winged monster and the Punisher, they decided not to give the artifact to Fisk but were attacked by his army of ninjas. They escaped by using the artifact, which took them back in time.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 25}}

===Shadowland===
During the time when [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] got control over [[Hand (Earth-616)|The Hand]], Fisk decided to meet with former Heroes for Hire, [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] and [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], to discuss how they were going to deal with Daredevil. When they refused, Fisk used a scroll in order to summon the [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]].{{r|Shadowland #2|3}}

After Daredevil's fallout, Kingpin became the new leader of the Hand, with [[Maki Matsumoto (Earth-616)|Lady Bullseye]], [[Mary Walker (Earth-616)|Typhoid Mary]], [[Jackson Brice (Earth-616)|Montana]] and [[Phillip Urich (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]] as his henchmen, using the group for his criminal purposes.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 512}}

===Big Time===
With the new [[Phillip Urich (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]] as his most recent incorporation to his organization, Fisk stole the experimental metal called Reverbium from [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon Labs]]. The Reverbium was destroyed because of its instability by [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] and [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]], leading to the destruction of the [[Fisk Towers|Fisk Tower]] and the death of Montana.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 648|650}} Shadowland was eventually brought down by [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Otto Octavius]] acting as Spider-Man. Fisk arranged for a body double to be found in the rubble of Shadowland, faking his death until such a time as he could reform his empire.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 14}}

===Downfall===
With his power over New York gone, Fisk set up shop in [[San Francisco]], with the intention of rebuilding his empire there. However, the vigilante known as the [[Maximillian Coleridge (Earth-616)|Shroud]] acted first, taking control of the local gangs and kidnapped the Owl, who also relocated his operations to San Francisco. He transformed Owlsley into a super-computer capable of taking control of all wifi signals in order to locate his ex, [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Julia Carpenter]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 4 15}} During this time, Daredevil revealed his secret identity, taking a positive approach to it this time and moved to San Francisco to practice law and continue his superhero career.{{r|Daredevil Vol 4 1}} Fisk began to make moves against both of his enemies, hiring the assassin [[Ikari (Earth-616)|Ikari]] to kidnap Foggy Nelson and Murdock's new girlfriend, [[Kirsten McDuffie (Earth-616)|Kirsten McDuffie]], and having his men look for Julia to have leverage against the Shroud.{{r|Daredevil Vol 4 17}}

However, the Shroud and Murdock came into conflict when Murdock and [[Jubula Pride (Earth-616)|Jubua Pride]], the Owl's daughter, attempted to free Owlsley. The Shroud then released all private information about Murdock's law practice's clients.{{r|Daredevil Vol 4 15}} Murdock went to Fisk and offered him a deal, he would use his resources to fix his situation and assure Foggy and Kirsten are safe, and in exchange Murdock would fake his death and get a new identity only Fisk would know, giving Kingpin back the power to destroy Daredevil, which he lost when he went public.{{r|Daredevil Vol 4 16}} However, Fisk went with his original plan instead and Ikari kidnapped Nelson and Kirsten. Meanwhile, the Shroud, Pride, and Murdock crashed when they attempted to get Julia at an airport, allowing Kingpin's goons to take her. Fisk presented his hostages when Murdock confronted him and had him fight Ikari to the death, with Fisk killing one of them if Murdock wins. The fight took them to the streets, where the Shroud saved Murdock and killed Ikari.{{r|Daredevil Vol 4 17}} Improvising, Matt took Ikari's costume and claimed to have killed Daredevil while the Shroud had the Owl bring to light all of Fisk's operations in exchange for his freedom, ruining his criminal career. While Kingpin and Daredevil fought, the federals stormed his building. Daredevil beat down the Kingpin when he tried to flee and rescued the hostages, leaving him to be arrested.{{r|Daredevil Vol 4 18}}

<!-- Events from Fisk's turn to "legitimate" business need to be added-->
===Mayor Fisk===
Fisk found himself among those trapped in [[Manhattan]] when [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] rose to power and used the supervillain [[Marcus Daniels (Earth-616)|Blackout]] to cast a [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]] dome which sealed the island off from the rest of the country. Fisk used his resources to help the innocent during this time, solely so people would hold him in high reward once the crisis was over.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 2}} Taking advantage of his new status, Fisk ran for mayor as an independent. While Fisk's natural charm earned him substantial support,{{r|Daredevil Vol 5 28}} he won by fixing the vote.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 605}} As part of his platform, Fisk promised to attack the vigilantes of the city, from the Punisher to even the likes of Spider-Man or Luke Cage.{{r|Daredevil Vol 5 28}}

Fisk's long-time nemesis Daredevil was determined to bring him down. In his guise as Matt Murdock, he agreed to become Fisk's deputy mayor,{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 595}} hoping to use the position against Fisk.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 597}} When Fisk was about to attend a meeting with various crime bosses, Daredevil and many of his fellow heroes planned to crash the meeting and capture Fisk red-handed. However, Fisk turned the tables on the heroes and had them arrested instead, including Daredevil. Fisk didn't get to enjoy his success as members of the Hand suddenly appeared and attacked him, leaving him in a coma. This caused Daredevil, as Matt Murdock, to become the new mayor of New York City.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 #600|601}} Murdock used his resources both as Daredevil and mayor to protect the city, and The Hand was eventually defeated in great part due to the efforts of the street-level vigilantes. After Fisk recovered, he took the reins back, and Murdock decided to quit. However, he made Fisk promise to give up on his crusade against vigilantism.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 #602|605}}

One of Fisk's biggest goals during his mayoralty became the acquisition of the Tablets of both [[Lifeline Tablet|Life and Time]] and [[Tablet of Death and Entropy|Death and Entropy]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 41}} with which he intended to resurrect Vanessa. Before embarking in this quest, Fisk had sought the help of the demonic entity [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Kindred]], who shunned Fisk arguing that Vanessa might resent being brought back. When Fisk suspected an archivist for the Department of Records named [[Gus Mapleton (Earth-616)|Gus Mapleton]] from withholding information from him about the Tablet of Life and Time, whose pieces had resurfaced scattered across Manhattan, Wilson tricked him into seeking help from [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]]. However, after Mapleton used magic to transfer his knowledge on the location of the fragments to Boomerang, the goon broke his deal with Fisk and proceeded to find the pieces of the tablet for himself.{{r|Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: King's Ransom Vol 1 1}}

Fisk attempted several times to apprehend Boomerang, who had tricked Spider-Man into helping him,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 41}} and ultimately assembled New York's crime bosses to assist him,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 61}} acquiring in the process the Tablet of Death and Entropy from [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mister Negative]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 59}} After finding all the pieces of the Tablet of Life and Time, Boomerang betrayed Spider-Man and ended up handing them over to Fisk. Having obtained the power of the two tablets, Fisk recalled Kindred's warning. Fisk decided to move on from Vanessa and instead resurrect Richard as an act of redemption for himself and Vanessa.{{r|Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: King's Ransom Vol 1 1}}
