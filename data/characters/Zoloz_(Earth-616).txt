| History                 = Zoloz's history seems be the same of his [[Earth-TRN892]] [[Zoloz (Earth-TRN892)|counterpart]], but when he arrived on [[Earth]] to fight [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] he was defeated by his own spell, which Strange learned by their prievous encounter. Strange convinced Zoloz that he could save his [[Zarax|home planet]] from [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] by becoming his [[Heralds of Galactus (Earth-616)|herald]] even if the other [[Zaraxians]] believe him coward because he didn't die a warrior.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 5 17}}
