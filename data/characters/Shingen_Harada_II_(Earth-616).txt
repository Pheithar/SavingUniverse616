===Early Life===
Born and raised in [[Japan]], Shingen "Shin" Harada was the illegitimate son of [[Keniuchio Harada (Earth-616)|Keniuchio Harada]] and as such the heir of the [[Clan Yashida (Earth-616)|Clan Yashida]]. He was also the boyfriend of [[Amiko Kobayashi (Earth-616)|Amiko Kobayashi]], the foster daughter of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 300|304}}
<!--Cried after his first kill cite-->
===Hellfire Academy===
At some point, he joined [[Kade Kilgore (Earth-616)|Kade Kilgore]]'s [[Hellfire Academy (Earth-616)|Hellfire Academy]],{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #31}} and partnered with [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] in order to recruit the newly activated [[Homo superior|mutant]] [[Iara Dos Santos (Earth-616)|Iara Dos Santos]], who soon after adopted the code-name Shark-Girl, unsuccessfully, after having battled both their target and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #20}}

[[File:Shingen Harada II (Earth-616) from Wolverine Vol 2 300 001.png|thumb|left|Unmasked]]

He designed the new hellfire academy.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #32}}

===Confronting Dario Agger===
As CEO of Yashida Corporation, Shingen represented the company at the [[Universal Bank]], where the richest people met to discuss anything relevant to the world. In this meeting, the heads of various companies came from across the globe to confront [[Dario Agger (Earth-616)|Dario Agger]] regarding [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]]'s [[War of the Realms|operations]] in the [[Glossary:Ten Realms|Ten Realms]], which Agger had kept secret from them. As Agger was unwilling to share the market he had just opened, and threatened anyone who dared to step up and take it from him, Shingen then accepted Agger's offer of taking the new market by force and told Agger this was now a hostile takeover. He then used his resources to sabotage Roxxon's global pipeline, had a spy break into Agger's corporate H.Q. to download a virus, and hacked into his personal cloud where Shingen revealed Agger's tan lines. Shingen then morphed into his [[Silver Samurai's Armor|Silver Samurai armor]] and threatened to slice Agger's head off. Just when Agger was about to transform into a [[Minotaurs|minotaur]] and fight Shingen, [[Oubliette Midas (Earth-616)|Exterminatrix]], of the [[Midas Foundation (Earth-616)|Midas Foundation]], arrived and knocked him out cold with 20,000 volts of electricity, and declared herself as the newest member of the group thereafter.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 8}}

| Powers                  = 
'''[[Healing Factor]]''' The nanotechnology injected into Shingen allows him to regenerate from fatal wounds. However, it is uncertain if it would allow regeneration of loss limbs or decapitation.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 33}}

| Abilities               = '''Ninjitsu:''' It's been repeatedly stated that Shin Harada has been trained in the ways of the Shinobi for a long time. Being adept enough to handle fighting Thor in closed quarters.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 9}}

'''Swordsman:''' Shin is skilled in the use of his katana and similar bladed weapons.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 300}}<!--A lot more then this has been compared to iron man-->

'''Engineering Specialist:''' Shingen boasted of having built prototype cybernetic energized structures since his early childhood.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 301}} Having even been adept enough to fabricate his own nanomolecular body mods from scratch just as easily.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 33}}

'''Adept Businessman:''' Harada runs his own multibillion dollar tech company appropriating in sales of technology begotten from his own design.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 8}}

'''Genius Level-Intelligence:''' Shingen Harada II possesses a keen and adept mind, even from an early age he was a technological savant whom had designed impressive wonders of mechanical craftsmanship.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 301}} Able to study and memorize scores of information and implement tactical stratagems against numerous foes in a telltale host of a thousand different scenarios in regards to combat, technological design, pre-emptive countermeasures and weapon specialization.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 31}} 

'''Skilled Combatant:''' The 2nd Silver Samurai is incredibly apt when it comes to hand to hand fighting with or without his cybernetic armor chassis. As was made evident by challenging the likes of [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]], [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Thor]], [[James Logan (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], dozens of [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand Ninja]] and their leader [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] on numerous occasions.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 301}}{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 9}}{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 31|33}}

'''Bilingual:''' Besides Japanese, Shin can speak a few different languages fluently for the sake of business expansion, including English and Swedish.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 31}}

| Strength                = Without his armor Shingen Harada only possesses the strength level of a decidedly average human male of his age, often engaging in moderate regular exercise through training and in combat situations. His powered structure vastly amplifies Shin's physical abilities well beyond acceptable levels, enabling him to battle the likes of an Asgardian empowered female of the species or genetically deviant terran specimen on equal footing. It's capacity to enable fighting against an apotheosized mortal empowered by Mjolnir suggests he can lift (press) in excess of [[Strength Scale#100 Tons|100 tons]] while wearing it.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 9|11}} It can potentially achieve higher power levels if sufficiently powered by an outside source.

| Weaknesses              = '''Arrogance:''' The Silver Samurai is overeagerly egocentric, often underestimating the enemy due to how much pride he possesses in his technology.

'''Handicap:''' While battling Logan over a mountain top pass, Shin lost his right arm during their conflict.{{r|Wolverine: Japan's Most Wanted: Infinite Comic Vol 1 11|13}} It is currently unknown if he got it reattached or replaced his missing limb with a bionic prosthesis.

| Equipment               = '''[[Silver Samurai's Armor]]'''
| Transportation          = Flight from jet boosters in armor.
| Weapons                 = '''[[Silver Samurai's Katana]]''', Nuclear Nunchuks

| Notes                   = * He admitted to be turned on by the were-shark, [[Iara Dos Santos (Earth-616)|Iara Dos Santos]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #20}}
