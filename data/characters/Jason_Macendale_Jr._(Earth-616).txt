===Jack O'Lantern===
The [[United States Marine Corps (Earth-616)|U.S. Marines]] recruited Jason Macendale while he was attending an undergraduate class at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], forming him into a fighter pilot. Upon discharge from the Marines, he began four years' active service as a [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|CIA]] field agent in the Asian theatre. However, his methods and tactics soon proved too brutal and extreme for his superiors to tolerate. Seeking employment elsewhere, Macendale embarked on a career as an international mercenary. Eventually evaluating his craft to a precise science, he adopted the distinctive costume of the Jack O'Lantern to help promote his accomplishments to prospective employers.{{r|Spider-Man: Back in Black Handbook Vol 1 1}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #279}}

[[File:Jason Macendale Jr. (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 6 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Jack O'Lantern]]
He later salvaged the [[Roderick Kingsley (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]]'s Battle Van after being hired through intermediaries by that villain.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #254}} However, the two men became rivals during the Gang War that raged in New York over the Kingpin's former territory.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #285|288}}

===Hobgoblin===
Macendale eventually hired the Foreigner to identify and kill [[Edward Leeds (Earth-616)|Ned Leeds]], who was believed to be the Hobgoblin. At the time it appeared Foreigner's assassins were successful,{{r|Spider-Man Versus Wolverine #1}} and Macendale became the new Hobgoblin.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #289}}

After losing fights with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and the [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #312}} Macendale took advantage of the [[Inferno (Event)|Inferno]] crisis by following several demons back to their lair and confronting their demonic lord, [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]]. Macendale wanted enough power to defeat his enemies, and offered his soul to N'astirh in exchange for such power. When N'astirh stopped laughing, the demon lord decided that Macendale's effrontery was worth something even if his soul wasn't, and had him possessed. This gave Macendale the physical strength he craved, coupled with superhuman speed and endurance.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #147}}

Despite his new power, Macendale was grotesquely misshapen by the demon possessing his body, giving him an appearance similar to his old Goblin masks. A spell cast by Doctor Strange later altered Macendale's perceptions, causing him to think he looked normal.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #11}}

After a brief scuffle with Spider-Man and [[Thomas Fireheart (Earth-616)|Puma]],{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 161}} Macendale broke [[Malcolm McBride (Earth-616)|Carrion]] out of the [[Vault (Prison)|Vault]] and manipulated him into uniting in their shared hunger for revenge against Spider-Man. Together, they captured him and held him captive in the sewers. Macendale promised to let Carrion kill Spider-Man, once he had arranged to be paid by [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]] to deliver him the Wall Crawler's head. However, Spider-Man managed to escape and defeat Carrion before an enraged Macendale arrived to finish the job himself. In the midst of the fight, Carrion, upon seeing Spider-Man shield [[Martha McBride (Earth-616)|his mother]] and [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Parker]] from harm, jumped in and took a [[Pumpkin Bomb]] for them, nearly killing him and Macendale in the process.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #162|163}}

Macandale was later recruited into the new Sinister Six,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #335}} working for [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] and later against him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #337|339}}{{r|Spider-Man #18|23}} Unfortunately, the demon who possessed him proved to be incompatible, and the two fought many a battle for control of Macendale's physical form until the demon literally ripped away from its human host and began a separate existence as the [[Demogoblin (Earth-616)|Demogoblin]].{{r|Web of Spider-Man #84|89}}

Powerless again, Macendale needed an edge and found it when he presented himself to [[Vladimir Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Vladimir Kravinoff]], the [[Grim Hunter]]. Kravinoff needed a guinea pig to test his [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|father]]'s [[Calypso Serum|serum]] on, and Macendale had nothing to lose. An element of his former demonic possession allowed Hobgoblin to survive the process that killed others, restoring his superhuman strength. And it was with this power that he managed to finish off his tormentor, the Demogoblin, once and for all.{{r|Spider-Man #46|49}}

After Doctor Octopus's murder, a more confident Hobgoblin, the [[Adrian Toomes (Earth-616)|Vulture]], [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]], and [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]] were recruited by [[Elias Hargrove (Earth-616)|Elias Hargrove]], a cousin of the Doctor, to steal Octopus' equipment and notes from a government facility. It was later revealed to be a scheme concocted by Mysterio to keep all the booty for himself.{{r|Spider-Man: Funeral for an Octopus Vol 1}} Later on, the Hobgoblin became leader of the Sinister Seven. He was concentrating his efforts on riding his new organization of Doctor Octopus' killer, [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]]. During this time, he had some trouble obtaining the Vulture's cooperation.{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited #9}}

Shortly after, Macendale was in the middle of leading a train robbery when a [[Phillip Urich (Earth-616)|new Green Goblin]] and [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|the Thing]] came barging in.{{r|Green Goblin #4}}

[[File:Jason Philip Macendale Jr. (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|left|Hobgoblin]]
Later, Macendale started working for [[Mendel Stromm (Earth-616)|Gaunt]] during the [[Clone Saga]] with the mercenary group called [[Cell-12 (Earth-616)|Cell-12]], who had outfitted him with cybernetic implants.{{r|Spider-Man #68}}{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #234}}

After being captured by [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]],{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 69}} Macendale revealed to the press of killing and replacing his apparent predecessor, Ned Leeds. He was transferred to [[Great Neck]]. He experienced nightmares of being haunted by Spider-Man and the Hobgoblin. Waking up, he was confronted by a mysterious figure standing outside his cell. He had the same voice as the Hobgoblin; in fact, he ''was'' the Hobgoblin. Ned Leeds was a "dupe" donning the costume. Because Macendale had become such an embarrassment, he had to die. And thus, he was blasted within close range, reduced to a smoldering skeleton.{{r|Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives #1}} [[Roderick Kingsley (Earth-616)|Roderick Kingsley]], the Hobgoblin, was back.{{r|Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives #3}}

===Dead No More===
Some time later, the [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Jackal]] brought Macendale back to life in a new [[Glossary:Clone|cloned]] body; Hobgoblin decided to stay with the Jackal, serving him at [[New U Technologies (Earth-616)|New U Technologies]] with other resurrected Spider-Man's villains.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 2}}

Jack O'Lantern's head is covered by a bulletproof helmet with an internal, 3 hour, compressed air supply and is equipped with telescopic infrared image intensifiers for seeing in the dark. The base of the helmet is equipped with a fine network of pin holes which maintained a low temperature flame ("stage-fire": a low density flame used safely on stage to simulate fire) their rings around his head at all times. The air supply cools the interior of the helmet semi-adiabatically through expansion.{{Citation}}
