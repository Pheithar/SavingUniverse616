<center>''This is an abridged version of Deviant Skrulls' history. For a complete history see '''[[Deviant Skrulls/Expanded History|Deviant Skrulls' Expanded History]]'''''</center>

The ancestors of the Skrulls were allegedly created by the [[Xorrians]] (along with all humanoid life-forms, such as [[Kree]] and [[Humans]]) from their own DNA.{{r|Thor #215}}{{r|Skrulls! #1}} These Skrull ancestors resided on [[Skrullos]], a planet in the Drox system. The Skrulls were once a peaceful race, until the [[Celestials (Race)|Celestials]] arrived at Skrullos over a 100 million years ago. The Celestials went on to split the Skrulls into three races: the [[Prime Skrulls|baseline Skrulls]], with no special abilities but the potential to evolve, the Deviant Skrulls, with shapeshifting abilities, and the [[Eternal Skrulls]], who were given longevity and super powers. Almost immediately, this led to war, in which the Deviant Skrulls exterminated the other two races.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 5}}

Thus all modern Skrulls are descendants of the Deviant branch. The Skrulls later split again, giving rise to the [[Dire Wraiths]], a parasitic race that could still shape-shift and had use of magic, but were not as technologically advanced as the Skrulls. Dire Wraith's are analogous to the Skrulls as [[vampires]] are to humans.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 5}} At some point, the Skrulls became genetically frozen in place, unable to evolve further, as punishment for a single Skrull abusing the power of the Crystal of Ultimate Vision, located within the [[Citadel of Light and Shadow]].{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 11}} It no longer appears to be the case as an increasing number of Skrulls are born as mutants, possessing the K-gene which gives them mutations and/or superhumans powers resulting in [[Skrull Mutants]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #376}}

During the reign of [[Dorrek (Earth-616)|Dorrek]], 10s of millions of years ago, the empire reached neighboring galaxies becoming an intergalactic empire.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 133}} Skrull science is generally at a higher level than the science of human civilization, having achieved a high level of science before life emerged on Earth at least 2.5 billion years ago.{{r|Captain America Annual Vol 1 7}} Skrull science created the first [[Cosmic Cube]] thousands of years ago, though it ended disastrously for the Skrull Empire. As upon becoming sentient the cube destroyed two-thirds of the inhabited worlds in the Andromeda galaxy, thereby plunging the Skrull Empire into a dark age of barbarism.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12}}{{r|Captain America Annual Vol 1 7}} The Skrulls were ruled by an Emperor or Empress, who had absolute power.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12|; Skrulls entry}}

==Biology==
===Reproduction===
Skrulls are oviparous.{{r|Marvel Fact Files #2}} Skrull females do not give live birth; instead, they lay eggs like their reptilian evolutionary ancestors.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 386}} Skrull children are known as "hatchlings". Despite their reptilian evolutionary roots, however, Skrulls have hair and the females have mammary glands and nurse their young. {{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12|; Skrulls entry}} Attempts at reproduction can be more effective at certain times during their reproductive cycle.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 6 5}}

====Hybrids====
{{Seealso|:Category:Skrull Hybrids}}
Skrulls are capable of producing [[Glossary:Hybrids|hybrid]] offspring with [[Homo sapiens|humans]] and [[Kree]].{{r|Marvel Fact Files #2}}

On [[Earth-9997]], it was revealed that [[Thanos (Earth-9997)|Thanos]] was a hybrid of an [[Eternals (Homo immortalis)|Eternal]] and a Skrull, as his mother [[Sui-San (Earth-616)|Sui-San]] was in fact a Skrull.{{r|Universe X #X}}

A conclave called the [[Knights of the Infinite (Earth-616)|Knights of Infinity]] are a nomadic band of Kree/Skrull hybrids who were gathered and created by the first of their kind; [[Dorrek Supreme (Earth-616)|Dorrek Supreme]], who is the heir to the throne of a Kree/Skrull alliance.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 #4}}

===Diseases and Genetic Conditions===
====Shape-Shifting Deficiency====
An uncommon birth defect in Skrulls is being born without the ability to shape-shift. Skrulls afflicted with this abnormality include [[Raze (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Raze]],{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 89}}{{r|Skrulls! #1|; [[Raze (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Raze]]'s entry}} [[Titannus (Earth-616)|Titannus]],{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 3 12}} and [[Talos (Earth-616)|Talos the Tamed]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #419}}{{r|Skrulls! #1|; [[Talos (Earth-616)|Talos the Tamed]]'s entry}} This genetic defect can also grant upper strength and endurance to some of those afflicted, including Talos the Tamed.{{r|Skrulls! #1|; [[Talos (Earth-616)|Talos the Tamed]]'s entry}}

====Cancer====
Skrulls are susceptible to various forms of cancer. The [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]] contracted leukemia due to prolonged exposure to the radiation in the {{WP|Van Allen Belts}}.{{r|Alpha Flight #10}} The Skrull prince [[Klundirk (Earth-616)|Klundirk]] was also diagnosed with an unknown form of cancer.{{r|{{cl|Spider-Woman Vol 6 3}}-[[Spider-Woman Vol 6 4|4]]}}

====Tuberculosis====
On [[Earth-829]], [[Skyppi (Earth-829)|Skyppi]] contracted a form of tuberculosis common to the Skrull species.{{r|Hercules: Twilight of a God #1}}

===Evolution and Mutation===
<!-- (Hidden for brevity reasons)
The Skrulls were stated to be given genetic and molecular instability and genetic diversity from the [[Celestials (Race)|Celestials]]' experimentation.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #30}}

However, with the elimination of the [[Prime Skrulls|"Normals"]] went away their capacity for benevolent mutation, and have existed at their current level of evolution for millions of years.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #10}} The [[Prime Skrull (Earth-616)|Prime Skrull]] demonstrated the latent [[Skrull Mutants|mutant]] abilities of his [[Prime Skrulls|kind]].{{r|Blackwulf #10}} -->

The Skrulls are evolutionarily stagnant. They can not evolve naturally and can only move forward genetically through artificial means.{{r|Skrulls! #1|; [[Citadel of Light and Shadow]]'s entry}}

Despite this, [[Skrull Mutants|mutants]] (a.k.a K-class deviants) have been observed, particularly on Carpiax-IV, where Lord Merek's fecundity-supplement program resulted a higher number of K-class births. It was common to cull Skrull mutants in the interest of genetic purity. One group of Skrull mutants, [[Cadre K (Earth-616)|Cadre K]], was rescued and trained by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]].{{r|Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet #1}}
<!-- (Hidden until a better place in the article can be determined)
After the loss of their shapeshifting abilities, tests showed that genetic mutation couldn't be accomplished by a male Skrull but could be induced by part of a female's life force in order to return such ability. [[S'Byll (Earth-616)|S'Byll's]] shapeshifting ability was returned, enhanced.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 25}} She was considered a mutant by the [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 27}} -->

<!-- (Hidden until it can be determined exactly what a Warskrull is)
===Warskrulls===
[[Image:Blackagar Boltagon (Skrull) (Earth-616) from New Avengers Illuminati Vol 2 5 001.jpg|right|thumb|A Super Skrull]]
A normal Skrull can only take on the appearance of their template, not the abilities of that person. Warskrulls, an elite group of Skrulls gifted with the ability to emulate the powers as well as the appearance of their templates.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #274|277}} Warskrulls do not naturally have this ability; instead, special encoding technology is used to grant them their powers.{{Citation}}

Once lost, the use of Mutant Skrulls permitted the recreation of the Warskrulls' genome.{{r|Skrulls! #1}} -->

[[File:Deviant Skrulls from Young Avengers Vol 1 11 001.jpg|thumb|Skrulls using their shape-shifting to fly]]
* '''Shapeshifting:''' Skrulls are able to alter their forms into that of anything they can imagine, be it organic or inorganic. It must, however, be solid. They can also use their abilities to grow extra limbs. They have no apparent size limit, as they are been seen to assume the form of a common housefly{{r|Fantastic Four: Unplugged #4}}, and shapes many times larger than their normal selves. Skrulls can also use their shape-shifting capabilities to change their sex: males can become females and vice versa.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 8}}
**'''Elasticity, Plasticity, Elongation''': Their shape-shifting abilities allow them to alter their bodies in much the same way as [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]], so that they can stretch to great lengths, or form other shapes with their bodies, such as balls, parachutes, or anything else.
***'''Flight:''' They are able to fly by shape-shifting a pair of wings onto their back, or turning their arms into wings.{{r|Young Avengers #11}}
**'''Size Alteration:''' They are also capable of altering their size independently of altering their form, allowing them to grow or shrink while maintaining their current form.
**'''Mimicry:''' Skrulls are cunning spies due to their ability to mimic sounds and voices. This is mainly used in conjunction with the shapes they shift into.
* '''Telepathy:''' Within the Deviant Skrulls there are a minority that possess telepathic abilities. They have been seen to serve the empire in the imperial court as "Priest of the Mind" and in the armed forces.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 348|349}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 44}}{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men Vol 1 4}}

| Abilities               = '''Weapon Formation:''' Skrulls are able to use their shapeshifting abilities to form weapons with parts of their bodies. For instance, they can shape their arms into blades or clubs including guns. This ability makes them dangerous hand-to-hand combatants.
| AvgStrength             = 
| Weaknesses              = * '''Shapeshifting Limitations:''' Skrulls can only take on the appearance of person and none of that person’s characteristics or, in the case of superhumans, their powers.{{r|Fantastic Four #2}} When they imitate an inorganic object, they take on its appearance, but not its properties. The inability to replicate powers does not apply to genetically modified [[Super-Skrulls (Earth-616)|Super-Skrulls]].{{r|New Avengers #40}}
* There is a limit to the size of the object or person a Skrull can imitate. The average Skrull cannot distend his or her mass any more than 1.5 times as large a volume as his or her original volume, nor can he or she contract his or her mass any more than 0.75 a volume as his or her original.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12|; Skrulls entry}}
* Very high decibel sounds have been shown capable of temporarily disabling a Skrull, and in the case of a [[Super-Skrulls (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]], will cause them to lose control of their powers.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 18}}
* At the moment of death, Skrulls revert to their original form.{{r|Mighty Avengers #16}}
* The natural shape of a Skrull possesses 18 pressure points that "when properly struck will cause pain and injury, even death."{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 40}}
* Skrull physiology is particularly vulnerable to the [[Legacy Virus]], Skrulls exposed to it, especially the strain created by [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Hank McCoy]] to target them exclusively, show symptoms within an hour and die within two days if not treated with the cure which McCoy also created.{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men #3|4}}
| GovernmentType          = Totalitarian monarchy under a single Emperor or Empress (succession disrupted by destruction of Tarnax IV, death of surviving royal family members, and ensuring civil wars, reinstated with the crowning of the new Emperor, [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Kl'rt I]]).

| Notes                   = 
* The Skrulls are somewhat associated with the [[Chitauri]].
* The native language of the Skrulls is called Skrullos{{r|Runaways Vol 2 8}}
* Skrulls have a natural lifespan of around 210 years.{{r|Annihilation: Super-Skrull Vol 1 1}}
| Trivia                  = 
* The adjective form is both "Skrull"{{citation}} and "skrullian".{{r|Skrulls! #1|; [[Flaw (Earth-616)|Flaw]]'s entry}}
* The Deviant branch of their species;{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12|; Skrulls entry}} it is kind of ironic that they considered [[Dire Wraiths]] as a "Deviant branch of Skrullkind",{{r|Rom #50}} and the [[Mutant Skrulls]] "[[Deviants]]".{{r|Uncanny X-Men #376}}{{r|A + X #16}}
* The Skrulls were originally set to appear in <i>[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]</i>, but were scrapped, most likely due to the deal between [[Glossary:20th Century Fox|20th Century Fox]] and [[Marvel Studios]], and were replaced with the [[D'bari (Race)|D'bari]], who unlike their comic book counterpart shared many similarities with the Skrulls.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474641/original-dark-phoenix-ending-included-skrulls-and-a-huge-new-york-battle-according-to-tye-sheridan|title=Original Dark Phoenix Ending Included Skrulls And A 'Huge' New York Battle, According To Tye Sheridan|first=Sean|last=O'Connell|work=Cinema Blend|date=June 10 2019|accessdate=June 9 2020}}}}
* It is possible that the idea of the shapeshifting Skrulls was inspired by the paranoia caused from disguised soviet spies during the [[wikipedia:Cold War#Espionage|Cold War]].{{r|{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hA0c3qIMOrw|title=How Captain Marvel Changed the Skrulls...|author=NerdSync|work=YouTube|date=April 13, 2019|accessdate=June 12 2020}}}}{{r|{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.denofgeek.com/comics/captain-marvel-who-are-the-skrulls/%3famp|title=Captain Marvel: Who Are the Skrulls?|first=Marc|last=Buxton|work=Den of Geek|date=March 12, 2019|accessdate=July 5, 2020}}}}
* Despite being oviparous, some Skrulls seem to possess navels which is a feature exclusive to the viviparous,{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man Vol 1 16}}{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 40|41}}{{r|Empyre: Aftermath Avengers Vol 1 1}} while others lack this feature as it would canonically seem they should.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 1}}{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 15}} It is possible that the presence of navels are errors and artist inconsistencies.
