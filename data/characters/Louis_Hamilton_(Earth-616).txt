| History                 = '''Louis Hamilton''' and two other [[Homo superior|mutants]], [[Frank Bohannan (Earth-616)|Crimson Commando (Frank Bohannan)]] and [[Martin Fletcher (Earth-616)|Super Sabre (Martin Fletcher)]], served as a super-powered team on the Allied side in [[World War II]]. They did not receive permission to continue their activities against the Communists and were mustered out. Hamilton returned to his home town in [[Massachusetts (State)|Massachusetts]], received a law degree, and became an attorney.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #215}}

Like Bohannan and Fletcher, however, he missed the excitement of using his powers in combat. The three became vigilantes. Hamilton would learn of a criminal who had escaped prosecution; they would then abduct him, release him in a nearby state park, chase him down, and mete out their own justice. This illegal scheme went on for some time, but it ended when they picked the wrong target: [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. She turned the tables on them, apparently killing Fletcher and subduing Hamilton and Bohannan. She convinced them to turn themselves in.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #215|#16}}

Fortunately, the federal government had recently formed a group of mutants known as [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]], most of whom had received pardons for their past bad acts. Hamilton took the same deal and joined the team, along with Bohannan and an unexpectedly living Fletcher.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #223}}

Hamilton's first assignment as a new member of Freedom Force was daunting: the event known as [[The Fall of the Mutants]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #225|227}}

Other missions involved attempts to capture mutants (such as [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]]{{r|New Mutants #65}}{{r|X-Factor #30|31}} and [[Russell Collins (Earth-616)|Rusty Collins]]){{r|New Mutants #78}} and to enforce the [[Registration Acts|Mutant Registration Act]].{{r|X-Factor #33}} Hamilton applied his legal skills when [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|Captain America (John Walker)]] helped Freedom Force set a trap for a group of mutant terrorists called the [[Mutant Force|Resistants]]: the government staged a trial of [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] to bring them out of hiding.{{r|Captain America #346}}

Hamilton joined a mission to help Freedom Force protect [[Muir Island]] from the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]]. During that battle, [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]] of the Reavers killed Hamilton with a massive charge of electricity.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #255}}

Hamilton appeared once more, when [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] had a near-death experience and encountered several deceased enemies - apparently just Wolverine's imagination, not a real appearance of Hamilton.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 176}}

Hamilton, along with many other deceased villains, was resurrected by [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]] and [[Eliphas (Earth-616)|Eli Bard]] with the [[Transmode Virus]]. He was seen with [[Martin Fletcher (Earth-616)|Super Sabre]] fighting [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] among others.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 22}} It was assumed that he returned to death once more upon Selene's defeat and destruction.
