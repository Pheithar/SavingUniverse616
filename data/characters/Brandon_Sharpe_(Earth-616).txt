| History                 = Born to a [[Ms. Sharpe (Earth-616)|mother]] seeking fame and a father who was an adulterous politician cheating on his wife, Brandon Sharpe's life was anything but normal. Thrust into the spotlight as an actor at a young age as his mother sought to live off his fame, Brandon grew to become uncomfortable with this fame, growing distanced from his mother, a distance that grew as she refused to listen to his complaints about [[Character Index/R#Rick|Rick]], his manager, who attempted to take advantage of him. During one of these attempts, Brandon's powers first manifested, frying the limo he was in and severely injuring his manager.{{r|Avengers Academy #5}}

With his new-found powers and taking the name Striker, Brandon sought to become a superhero...but found stopping crime to be more difficult than it appeared. Turning to performing, he became a fixture at monster truck shows, showing his power off to paying audiences.  When [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] grew aware of this, he brought Striker in and lavished him with money and women, something Striker quickly grew bored with.{{r|Avengers Academy #5}}

===Avengers Academy===
After Osborn's fall, Striker was brought into the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]], along with several young superheroes who had been held and tortured by Osborn. Not letting on that he had received better treatment, Striker led the others in finding out the connection they all had to Osborn, and grew the belief that the Academy staff feared the teens would become villains.{{r|Avengers Academy #1}}
