===Origin===
'''Dr. Kavita Rao''' was born in [[Calcutta]], [[India]],{{r|X-Men: Earth's Mutant Heroes #1}} began her career there and traveled to [[England]]{{r|X-Men: Blind Science #1}} and [[America]]{{r|X-Men: Blind Science #1}} in the pursuit of advanced degrees in genetics.{{r|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}} At the end of her studies she had acquired PhDs/Doctorates in biochemistry and mutant genetics.{{r|X-Men: Earth's Mutant Heroes #1}} She was described as a "passionate student determined to change the world" at the cost of her private life,{{r|X-Men: Earth's Mutant Heroes #1}} and eventually became a world-renowned geneticist, but her hope of changing the world was forgotten in the process.{{r|X-Men: Blind Science #1}}

She met [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Hank McCoy]] years before,{{r|X-Men: Earth's Mutant Heroes #1}} at a cloning seminar in [[Berlin]],{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 2}} along with [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggert]] and [[Sarah Kinney (Earth-616)|Sarah Kinney]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 40}}

[[File:Kavita Rao (Earth-616) from Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 6 0001.png|thumb|left|170px|Approached by [[Ord (SWORD) (Earth-616)|Ord]]]]
====Fighting the [[Legacy Virus]]====
Kavita dedicated herself to curing the [[Legacy Virus]], a lethal disease plaguing the mutant community, but failed despite being close to a cure. The disease was cured by [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Hank McCoy]]. A few weeks later, the alien [[Ord (SWORD) (Earth-616)|Ord]] of the [[Breakworld]] came to her, offering significant amounts of data, that could have helped her cure the virus, had she received it in time. Rao attempted to direct him to Hank McCoy, but since McCoy was a mutant, Ord did not believe that he would be objective in achieving Ord's supposed goal; "curing" the mutant gene. Alongside [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]] of [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]], he presented her the case of [[Tildie Soames (Earth-616)|Tildie Soames]],{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 6}} a mutant girl whose power to physically manifest her own nightmares had inadvertently caused the death of her parents and a police officer.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 2}} The case convinced Rao to aid accept Ord's aid and begin work on developing a mutant cure, under the understanding that no one would be hurt in the process. Unbeknownst to her, Ord's true motives were to remove mutantkind from the equation, due to a prophecy predicting that a mutant, most likely an X-Man, would destroy Breakworld.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 6}}

[[File:Kavita Rao (Earth-616) from Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|Rao presented the serum]]
===The [[Hope Serum]]===
Working for [[BeneTech Laboratories]] and Ord,{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 3}} using at least [[Tildie Soames (Earth-616)|Tildie Soames]], [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]],{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 4}} a mutant girl who "committed suicide", and several mutants acquired by Ord from the [[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X]]'s concentration camp of [[Neverland]],{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 4}}{{r|X-Men: Earth's Mutant Heroes #1}} Kavita was able to develop a serum (later called "[[Hope Serum|Hope]]" by the mutants themselves){{r|New X-Men Vol 2 40}} which could "cure" [[Homo superior|mutants]], turning them into normal humans.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 1}} To create such a cure, she used as a base the Legacy Virus cure present within a revived [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]].<ref>{{cl|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #2}}, [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]] entry</ref>

After a time of research and development, Kavita Rao presented both the Serum and Tildie to the public, offering the cure to every willing mutant and any interested nations, although it still wasn't approved by the government.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 #1|2}} Hundreds of mutants immediately signed up for the procedure at [[BeneTech Laboratories]], forming massive crowds waiting night and day for the serum.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 #3|4}}{{r|X-Men: Earth's Mutant Heroes #1}}

====[[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] intervention====
The same night, while the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] were discussing the subject, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] infiltrated [[BeneTech Laboratories]] to steal a sample. Rao intercepted him, and after a short conversation, she offered him a sample freely, to Ord's great displeasure.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 #2|3}}

After Beast recognised the DNA of [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] present in the cure, the X-Men infiltrated BeneTech Laboratories, and freed him.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 4}} Taken down by BeneTech security, they were rescued by Kavita who ordered the soldiers to stand down so that she could administer first aid to the wounded Cyclops. Once the security agents left, the X-Men intended to destroy the building and the cure, and Rao immediately bluffed, stating that she had released samples and all her data to hundred of research teams across the world.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 5}}

The facilities were eventually invaded by mutants seeking the cure, and Ord fled, kidnapping Tildie and taking all his data and samples before leaving with the main building of BeneTech, in fact a space ship. Everyone inside was saved by Kavita's warning, who pleaded with the X-Men to save her Tilde. Performing a [[Fastball Special]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] was able to reach the ship and force Ord to land, delivering him into the hands of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Dr. Rao's work was destroyed by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], leaving Hank with the last sample of "Hope".{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 6}}

===[[M-Day]]===
{{Quote|I am obsolete now, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Hank]]. Surely you realise that. My field of research is soon be an exercise in archaeology. Who needs a mutant geneticist when there are [[M-Day|no more]] [[Homo superior|mutants]]?|Dr. Kavita Rao|New X-Men Vol 2 40}}
When the fact came out that her work derived from the science of the [[Breakworld]], she became a pariah in the scientific community. With no more mutants, Rao was workless because of his condition of mutation expert. Her new goal was to reverse the [[M-Day]] effect by creating a clone from inert mutant DNA.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 40}}

[[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|McCoy]] contacted her among various villain scientists, searching a cure to the [[M-Day]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 200}} Contrary to the other geniuses, Rao asked Beast to come see him within three days, promising to help him with the few resources she had.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #488}} When he came, Kavita presented him the violent effects of the M-Day: All her X-Gene samples had turned in dust. Warning him from crossing the line for his quest, Rao handed him [[BeneTech]], [[Breakworld]] and even [[Neverland]] files, before returning to [[India]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 40}}

While she argued on the fact that mutants wanted the cure, and that she indeed made terrible things to develop the cure,{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 40}} she came to see that her actions could have sent the mutants to their extinction.{{r|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}}

===[[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] & [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]] member===
Rao later joined the [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]], a group of scientists gathered by McCoy and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Warren Worthington]] to assist in solving how to reverse the effects of [[M-Day]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #508}} She quickly started a tense relation with [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Doctor Nemesis]], because of his universal antipathy.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #509}}

Along with the rest of the X-Club, she traveled back to 1906 to obtain blood samples from first generation's mutant's parents from [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]]'s era, the people matching the best being Nemesis' parents.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #509|512}}

Kavita Rao was in [[Graymalkin Industries|Graymalkin]] when the riots started with the arrival [[Simon Trask (Earth-616)|Simon Trask]]'s [[Humanity Now! (Earth-616)|Humanity Now! Coalition]] in San Francisco.{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1}}

===[[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]]===
Aboard the [[X-Sub]] and along the X-Club, she participated to the extraction of the [[Asteroid M]] and the establishment of [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #514}}{{r|Dark Avengers #8}}

Once the battle with [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s [[X-Men (Osborn) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and [[Avengers (Osborn) (Earth-616)|Avengers]], Kavita was seen along with [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]], examining [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] who was invaded by [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|Void]] and stuck in diamond form.{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Exodus #1}}

She played bridge the night with [[Yuriko Takiguchi (Earth-616)|Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi]] the night before he died, and was present at the meeting to discuss the modalities of his funeral, but felt bad about a sea burial for her former colleague. She soon later assisted to his cremation and funeral.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #515}}

During the first times of Utopia, she was taken as hostage by [[Wendy Sherman (Earth-616)|Stinger]], as she was frighten and wished to have a talk with [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], using that action to catch the attention.{{r|Nation X #1}}

The X-Club profited from the arrival of [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] to use him in order to prevent the Asteroid M from sinking, using electro-magnetism as power source, but the project proved to be inefficient.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #518|519}}

She assisted [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Nemesis]] in the construction of a defense preventing proper trans-reality teleportation from happening, following the first attack of [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]] on the island.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #229|230}}

After their mission against [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]], the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] then [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]] were interviewed by Kavita, as a debriefing, and gathering informations on [[Marci Sabol (Earth-616)|Marci]], a girl trapped in Legion's mind.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 5}} Those post-mission briefings were part of her common activities on the island.{{r|X-Men: Earth's Mutant Heroes #1}}

With Magneto's coming, he dragged the [[Breakworld]] bullet with [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] in it, putting the X-Club on a new project: Prevent the bullet from hitting [[Earth]], leaving Kavita with the task of caring about the once-again passed out Magneto.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #521|522}} <!-- => Second Coming but before Necrosha -->
...

===[[Second Coming]]===
The X-Club was part of the central command, coordinating the actions of the X-Men along with Cyclops.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #523}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy #235}}

Along the X-Club, she acted in the infirmary, where she operated on [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]] with her colleagues, replacing her missing limb by a mechanical limb.{{r|Second Coming: Prepare #1}}

In the command room, she assisted to the briefing about [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]]'s rescue mission. Agreeing with [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]], the X-Club feared from [[Bastion (Earth-616)|Bastion]]'s mysterious towers, and so started to investigate on the subject.

Kavita also examined [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], assisted to [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]]'s funeral{{r|Uncanny X-Men #524}} before they left for an oil rig 3,5 miles off the coast of San Francisco, who revealed to be part of Bastion's plots:{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 13}}

<!-- Adventure in [[Earth-10710]] -->...{{r|X-Men: Blind Science #1}}

The X-Club managed to escape, trying to warn Cyclops that Bastion was targeting Utopia and attempted (successfully) to keep the X-Club away,{{r|X-Men: Legacy #236}} and Kavita Rao was able to make peace with herself for the creation of the Hope Serum,{{r|X-Men: Earth's Mutant Heroes #1}} throwing the bracelet with the formula into [[San Francisco Bay]]. They quickly tried to understand and take down the Sphere who had been raised around Utopia, and were rapidly joined by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]],{{r|X-Men: Legacy #236}} then the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #525}} The whole three teams combined scientists were unable to shut down the Sphere.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 28}}

====Aftermaths====
After the battle, she was back to the sick bay, taking care of the wounded, including [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]],{{r|X-Men: Second Coming #2}} the still intangible [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] and theorizing the explanation of why Pryde was still phasing,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #526}} and [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #527}} She also performed tests on [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]]'s use of his powers on the bionic hands he had since he lost his natural ones against the [[Nimrod (Earth-10076)|Nimrods]], and was interrogated by Cyclops on Hellion, after an accident happened between him and [[Karima Shapandar (Earth-616)|Karima]] where the Omega Sentinel had his programming restored and attacked mutants during a reconstruction operation of San Francisco by the X-Men.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #242|243}}

===[[Regenesis]]===
Kavita Rao remained on Utopia, still acting as physicist of the base.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 44}}

<!-- [[Escape From the Negative Zone]] -->...{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 2 3}}

After the [[Age of X|reality warping]] by [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]], Kavita presented the various consequences to Cyclops: [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]]'s new control of his hands and powers, [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]]'s powers return and chest explosion, and [[Rachel Summers (Earth-11326)|Revenant]], kind of a plasma ghost of Cyclops' alternate daughter [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]].

[[File:Younger X-Men (Earth-616) from Avengers Academy Vol 1 29 0001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]], [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]] and [[X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]] sent to the [[Avengers Compound]]]]
===[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]===
While the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] were at war with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], the [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]]n students were transferred in custody in the [[Avengers Compound]], while the X-Club members [[Madison Jeffries (Earth-616)|Jeffries]] and Rao agreed to serve as de facto guards.{{r|Avengers Academy #29}} When [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]] escaped from his containment unit, Rao logically but erroneously assumed that he might intend to take revenge on [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], responsible for his mind erasure.{{r|Avengers Academy #30}} When a brawl started on the matter that the mutants should have to go free or not, Rao stated that they should be allowed to take part in the conflict, "or not", according to their personal choices, just wanting to get back to her lab herself. After a fake fight for the Academy staff to justify the escape of all Utopians from the Compound, Kavita was teleported away along Madison and the students by [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]].{{r|Avengers Academy #31}}

Her whereabouts during the rest of the conflict are unknown.

===Joining [[Jean Grey School]]===
After the conflict and the dissolution of [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]]'s [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]], she joined the [[Jean Grey School]]. Acting as the physicist of the school, she was knocked out by [[Sojobo-Tengu (Earth-616)|Sojobo-Tengu]], possessed by [[Luca Aldine (Earth-616)|Luca Aldine]] as he wanted to kill his sister [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]], while she was being examined by Rao.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 #5|6}}

She was also contacted by the [[Institute of Bio-Social Studies]] of [[San Francisco]] in order to reproduce the [[Hope Serum]], but refused to help to the great displeasure of [[Nina Ambrose (Earth-616)|Dr. Nina Ambrose]], forcing the IBSS to produce the [[X-Cise]], a cure which worked by damaging the mutant brains and leaving them in a child-like state.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 11}}
