[[File:Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616) and Hope Summers (Earth-616) from X-Factor Vol 3 26 001.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] escaping with the mutant infant]]
The baby that would become known as Hope was born the daughter of [[Louise Spalding (Earth-616)|Captain Louise Spalding]] of the [[Cooperstown]] Fire Department.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 527}}

'''Hope''' was the first new mutant born since [[Decimation|M-Day]]. Her birth caused telepathic shockwaves so powerful that  [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]] exploded after detecting her.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 204}} Soon after, her birthplace in [[Cooperstown]], [[Alaska (State)|Alaska]] was attacked by the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]], who had used information received from a time-traveling [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] warning them of her arrival. Although everyone else in the town was murdered by the Purifiers, [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] managed to save her. According to him, the baby was a messiah supposed to save both [[Homo superior|mutants]] and [[Homo sapiens|humankind]]. However, according to the Purifiers and [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]], she would become an evil antichrist and kill a million humans, turning humanity against mutants once and for all, thus leading to a new era of mutant persecution, the very [[Earth-1191|timeline]] in which Bishop was born.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 205}}

She was stolen from Cable by the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] and delivered to [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]], who was actually [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] in disguise. She had secretly replaced Sinister and stolen the child in the hope that it could cure her comatose daughter [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]]. Mystique's plan worked, and Rogue was cured of the Strain 88 virus. After a huge battle between the Marauders, [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], and [[Predator X]], the X-Men claimed the child and [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] decided that the baby would be better off with Cable, and allowed his son to take her into the [[Earth-80521|future]]. However, an enraged Bishop decided to track Cable and the baby down in order to finally kill her and prevent [[Earth-1191|his future]] from happening.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 207}}

===Into the [[Earth-80521|Future]]===
Upon jumping into the future, Cable eventually took her to the secluded safe haven of [[Earth-80521#New Liberty|New Liberty]] to escape from Bishop, where Cable married a fellow civilian named [[Hope Summers (Earth-80521)|Hope]], who became like a mother to the mutant baby. The pair settled down and raised the child. Years passed, and since his last battle with Bishop damaged his time machine, Cable could only jump forward in time and was unable to return to the X-Men for help. When the child was seven, New Liberty was invaded by the remnants of the U.S. government, who had spliced themselves with cockroach DNA. Cable fought them off and left New Liberty in order to prevent the Cockroaches from returning. After spending months in the wasteland, the family was attacked by the president of the insects. The young Hope managed to take him down and Cable questioned the president, deducing from his story that in order to find Hope in the future, Bishop had destroyed all the continents in the world, except North America, in order to more easily find her and kill her. Cable killed the president, and the family moved on. They encountered a settlement, but were met with a pack of marauders. Cable took care of them easily, but not fast enough, as Hope's mother was shot and died in Cable's arms while she watched. Hope saw Cable bury her mother and departed with him. After arriving at a church, the pastor asked the name of the child. Cable had refused to name her, since he felt that it was not his place to do so, but decided to name her '''Hope Summers''', in honor of her adoptive mother.{{r|{{cl|Cable Vol 2 8}}-[[Cable Vol 2 10|10]]}}

===[[Messiah War]]===
[[File:Hope Summers (Earth-616) from X-Force Cable Messiah War Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A young Hope Summers]]
In an effort to find and kill her, Bishop made an alliance with Cable's evil clone, [[Nathaniel Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]]. The pair set a trap for Cable and Hope, constructing a time-net that prevented them from jumping forward in time. When the X-Men finally found them, Cyclops sent [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] to bring them back, only for them to also become trapped. Hope was kidnapped by Stryfe, and after he realized who she was, he stopped Bishop from killing her, intending instead to steal her body and power. Stryfe was defeated by Cable and X-Force, with the help of [[Apocalypse (Earth-80521)|Apocalypse]]. Despite also wanting to steal her body, Apocalypse was convinced to leave her as thanks for X-Force having saved him. He promised however that he would return for Hope one day. When Cable and Hope were forced to time travel again, Hope resisted because she wanted to stay with X-Force members [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] and Elixir, with whom she had bonded during the battle. Angry at Cable for forcing her to leave, she kicks him mid-jump, stranding herself and Cable two years apart from each other.{{r|Cable Vol 2 13|15}}

===Emil Spence===
Hope fled the rubble of Stryfe's Celestial City and befriended [[Emil Spence (Earth-80521)|Emil Spence]], a descendant of Stryfe's clone warriors. Hope survived for two years, with the help of Emil, until rejoining Cable and fleeing the now dying Earth on the second last spaceship on the planet, the ''[[Ensabahnur I]]'', which Cable commandeered posing as Stryfe. Hope was devastated at being forced to leave Emil, the boy she loved.{{r|{{cl|Cable Vol 2 16}}-[[Cable Vol 2 17|17]]}}

At some point during their journey, Hope accidentally revealed Cable's true identity, and he was imprisoned. Bishop and Emil eventually caught up to Cable and Hope, Emil being under the impression that Cable had kidnapped Hope and Bishop was her true father. Bishop was also armed with a thermonuclear device which he planned to activate as soon as he saw Hope. While Bishop and Emil raided the ''Ensahabnur I'', Emil and Hope were reunited and Hope explained to Emil that Bishop was, in fact, the one trying to kill her.{{r|{{cl|Cable Vol 2 18}}-[[Cable Vol 2 19|19]]}}

During Bishop's attack, the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]], attracted to Hope's power, attacked both ships, distracting Bishop from Hope. While Cable and Bishop both fought the Brood, Hope and Emil made their way to the ship's two terraforming pods, which would facilitate their escape. Emil placed Hope in the pod against her will as she refused to leave Cable. As Emil was preparing the second pod Cable appeared and Emil gave the second pod to Cable, sacrificing his own life.{{r|Cable Vol 2 20}}

After Cable and Hope left, Emil obtained Bishop's thermo-nuclear weapon, detonating it moments before he could be attacked by a Brood. However, Bishop escaped by allowing himself to be absorbed by an [[Acanti]], and two years later he had tracked Hope and Cable in cryo-sleep within their terraforming pods.{{r|Cable Vol 2 20}}

===Homecoming===
Hope and Cable survived the brutal crash-landing back onto the [[Earth-80521|dying Earth]]. Hope and Cable made camp in ruins infested with mutant rats.{{r|X-Men: Hope #1}} Soon Hope made the decision that she was ready to go [[Earth-616|home]] and join the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. However, the only fully functioning time machine was in Bishop's robotic arm, and Bishop was still trapped inside a dying Acanti. Cable blew up the Acanti corpse, awoke Bishop and narrowly escaped with Hope into the past, but not before Bishop fired a bullet point-blank at Hope's head. Fortunately, Hope's mutant powers manifested and she used Cable's [[telekinesis]] to stop the bullet in midair.{{r|Cable Vol 2 21}}

The cobbled-together time machine turned out to be somewhat faulty, making it difficult to time-slide to a specific date. Also, the remnants of Bishop's time device were triggered with each jump, allowing him to follow them anywhere in time. A violent chase ensued across numerous time periods on [[Manhattan|Manhattan Island]] including the Revolutionary War and ruins of the apocalyptic future.{{r|Cable Vol 2 22}} Suddenly, they arrived in 2044 where Cable and Hope were briefly reunited with [[Sophie Pettit (Earth-80521)|Sophie Pettit]]. However, Bishop also met some former comrades, the [[Turnpike Authority (Earth-80521)|Turnpike Authority]], and began chasing Hope with his new reinforcements. Unfortunately, during the chase, the car carrying Cable, Hope, and Sophie crashed in [[Central Park]]. Cable was able to save Hope and time-jump, but Sophie died. Hope and Cable landed in Central Park in the year of 1933 and wasted no time in moving before Bishop could follow.{{r|Cable Vol 2 23}} Cable and Hope made several more rapid time jumps, each time overshooting their true destination, but each time getting closer. Bishop finally reached them and was almost successful in killing Hope until Cable activated the time device in his arm to send Bishop to the year 6700 AD. Finally free of their pursuer, Hope and Cable borrow a car and drive to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|X-Mansion]] and prepare for their final jump into the present.{{r|Cable Vol 2 24}}

===[[Second Coming]]===
Cable and Hope arrived in the present at the ruins of the Xavier Institute. While searching the rubble for clues on the X-Men's current whereabouts, a team of [[Right (Earth-616)|Smiley Faces]] attacked them. They were able to escape, but had now alterted [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]] about the Mutant Messiah's return.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming Vol 1 1}} Bastion began tracking the pair using Cable's [[Techno-Organic Virus|T.O. virus]] as a beacon. [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Hodge]]'s Smiley-Faces and [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Stryker]]'s Purifiers both continued to pursue the pair, but the X-Men were also alerted to Hope and Cable's return via the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] and Cerebra.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 523}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 12}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 235}}

The X-Men were able to stop both the Purifiers and Smiley Faces and catch up to Cable and Hope. Once the X-Men understood how Bastion was tracking Cable, they broke into two teams: [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], Rogue and Hope teleporting back to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] and Wolverine, Cable and the remainder of Alpha Team acting as decoys.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 235}} Bastion quickly uncovered the deception and attempted to kill Hope personally, but he was confronted by Rogue and then damaged when Nightcrawler sacrificed himself to save Hope by teleporting in one leap from [[Las Vegas]] to Utopia.

After Hope arrived on Utopia, Bastion launched the next phase of his plan. During the months leading up to Hope's return, a large energy dome was built over the [[San Francisco|Bay Area]] to cut off the X-Men from either escaping or getting help. Once the dome was activated, Bastion opened a dimensional portal to his [[Earth-811|home reality]] to allow an army of [[Nimrod (Earth-811)#Nimrod-Series Sentinel|Nimrod-Series Sentinels]] to travel back to the past and kill Hope.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 236}} Like the original Nimrod, these Sentinels were able to detect, analyze and adapt to mutant powers as well as self-repair. The X-Men were barely able to subdue them, and several X-Men sustained severe injuries.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 27}} Every five minutes a wave of five new Nimrod Sentinels continued to appear through the portal.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 14}} Only by sending [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]], Cable and [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]] on a one-way mission into [[Earth-811|the future]] to reprogram and destroy the Nimrod Master Molds were the X-Men successful in defeating them.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 27}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 237}} However, to get X-Force home safely, Cable sacrificed his own life.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 28}}

Once the dimensional portal was closed, Bastion decided it was time to confront Hope personally. He converted both [[Graydon Creed (Earth-616)|Graydon Creed]] and [[Stephen Lang (Earth-616)|Stephen Lang]] into robotic forms in order to battle the X-Men on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Hope, grieving profusely at the death of her father, allowed her sorrow to turn into purposeful rage. Her mutant powers manifesting once more and Hope was able to draw on the mutant powers of the X-Men around her and single-handedly destroyed Bastion, Lang and Creed.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 28}}

After the battle, Hope laid down cradled in the remains of Cable's techno-organic arm and fell asleep for nearly 30 hours due to sheer exhaustion.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming #2}}

===[[Lights (Earth-616)|The Lights]]===
[[File:Hope Summers (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men The Heroic Age Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Hope wanted to find her family in [[Alaska (State)|Alaska]]]]
Once the dust had settled after the final battle with Bastion, Hope, accompanied by Rogue and [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Dr. Nemesis]], were sent to the [[Baxter Building]] in [[New York City]] to be thoroughly examined by [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]]. After the examination, Richards concluded that Hope showed no major signs of damage from time-traveling. He did recommend she have some dental work done and begin a vaccination regimen. He also said a biological family history would be most helpful.{{r|Uncanny X-Men: The Heroic Age #1}}

When Hope returned to Utopia, she was confronted by Cyclops. They agreed to not let Cable's death stand between them and Cyclops began to tell Hope to accompany a small group visiting the five newly manifested mutants, but Hope refused to go. Cyclops realized he was expecting too much from Hope and, per her request, promised to send her and a few X-Men to Cooperstown, Alaska to search for clues of her family.{{r|Uncanny X-Men: The Heroic Age #1}}

Hope went to Alaska with Rogue, Cypher and Dr. Nemesis, and discovered her mother's identity (Louise Spalding). While visiting her grave, Hope met her [[Mrs. Spalding (Earth-616)|grandmother]], who invited her to her place and told her all about Louise, oblivious she was talking to her granddaughter.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 526}}

Immediately after leaving Alaska, Hope and the others headed to [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]] to save "[[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|the first light]]". Hope arrived just in time to save Laurie's life and stabilize her powers. After that, Laurie was committed to following Hope to the ends of the [[Earth]]. From Canada, Hope and the others went to [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] where Hope similarly saved [[Gabriel Cohuelo (Earth-616)|Gabriel Cohuelo]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 526|527}}

Next Hope, accompanied by [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], traveled to [[Nigeria]] to save [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie Okonkwo]] from a paramilitary group threatening to kill her. Hope stabilized her powers and brought her back to Utopia with the others.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 528}}

The next light was originally located in the [[Ukraine]], but when Hope, Rogue and the other lights arrived in [[Kyiv]], he was gone. They tracked him over most of [[Europe]] and finally found him in [[Miami Beach]], [[Florida (State)|Florida]]. Like the other lights, Hope was able to stabilize [[Teon Macik (Earth-616)|Teon]]'s powers, and unlike the other she also "tamed" him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #529}} After Teon joined, the group set off for [[Japan]] to stop the [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|fifth light]] from destroying [[Tokyo]].{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 1}}

At first, Hope was unable to get close enough to touch Kenji, but she was able to control her powers enough to mimic Kenji although the strain of mimicking his powers made her faint with exhaustion.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 2}} Cyclops then ordered the Lights and Hope to stand back while the X-Men handled Kenji. Ignoring this order, Hope convinced the Lights to help her save Kenji. She was able to again mimic Kenji's powers and use them to successfully subdue Kenji so she could physically touch him which resulted in the stabilization of both his powers and personality.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Hope Summers (Earth-616) and Sixth Light (Earth-616) from Generation Hope Vol 1 7 0001.png|thumb|left|Hope tries, and fails, to calm the Sixth Light]]

After the incident in Tokyo, Cyclops replaced Rogue with [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] as his envoy to the team. As a newly officially sanctioned X-Men team, the [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]] were deployed to [[Germany]], where a [[Sixth Light (Earth-616)|sixth light]] had activated. They discovered the new light was, in fact, an unborn child who [[Telepathy|telepathically]] took control of those near him. Kenji and Teon proved immune to its power, and Kenji was able to create links to the rest of the lights to protect them as well. Laurie theorized that the child was acting out because it did not want to be born, and so Hope had Kenji link them to the baby. After several attempts to reason with it, Teon managed to calm the baby, and he was successfully delivered. Hope touched him, stabilizing his powers. The Lights then left Germany to return to Utopia; Teon's family had started legal action to regain custody of him.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 6|7}}

While awaiting the trial, Hope was furious with the blasé attitude taken by [[Kavita Rao (Earth-616)|Dr. Rao]] and [[Evangeline Whedon (Earth-616)|Evangeline Whedon]] about Teon's custody. In an effort to distract her team from the looming legal proceedings, Hope insisted on adopting code names. Later despite his normally animalistic nature, Teon was able to eloquently offer a sound case of why he needed to stay with Hope and the X-Men. Immediately after the trial, Laurie and Kenji began to speculate on the reason all of the Lights (themselves included) seemed to be so drawn to following Hope.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 8}}

After the events in Germany and Teon's trial, Hope and her team continued to train and prepare for more new mutant activations. Thanks to the Stepford Cuckoos monitoring via Cerebra, Hope and the Lights were alerted almost immediately of activation of the [[Zeeshan (Earth-616)|Seventh Light]]'s powers. They left quickly, but arrived just after Zee had committed suicide. The whole team took the death very hard.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 9}}

===[[Fear Itself]]===
Laurie and Idie decided to confront Hope and force her to take a break from her constant training. The trio went shopping in [[San Francisco]] and was ambushed by [[Frank Bohannan (Earth-616)|Crimson Commando]], who kidnapped Hope. Wolverine tracked her down and rescued her. This allowed Hope to confront him on why he's avoided her, and Wolverine shared his fear of the potential of eventually having to kill her, which Hope respected.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 540}}

When [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Kuurth]], one of the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]]'s [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]], was marching on to destroy San Francisco and Utopia, Hope was a vital part of Cyclops's second plan. After the initial attempt to stop Kuurth failed, Cyclops instructed Hope to utilize the power of the other X-Men to remove Kuurth's helmet. She was successful, but Kuurth proved more difficult to stop than the regular Juggernaut.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 541}} Kuurth was eventually driven off by [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], who had become the new Juggernaut.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 543}}

===[[Schism (Event)|Schism]]===
[[File:Hope Summers (Earth-616) Laurie Tromette (Earth-616) Generation Hope Vol 1 10.png|thumb|right|Laurie and Hope argue]]
After Idie killed the attacking [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] soldiers at the Mutant History Museum, Laurie confronted her for allowing it to happen. Laurie also disagreed with Hope on the issue of whether to remain on Utopia or not, but Hope forced her to stay. In the aftermath, Laurie insisted that Idie be made to go with Wolverine; Hope relented.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis Vol 1 1}}

Hope's relationship with Gabriel was cut short when she discovered him kissing [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]]. However, Hope harbored no ill will towards Pixie and invited her to join the Lights.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 12|13}}

===[[Regenesis]]===
Believing they had discovered a new light, Hope and her team instead found [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]] who had previously been mind-wiped by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] and now had no memory of his past. Hope brought him back to Utopia and convinced Cyclops to allow him to join her team. Later, Kenji put his plans to betray her into motion and attacked her and the rest of the Lights. With help from [[Martha Johansson (Earth-616)|No-Girl]], they managed to kill him.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 17}} 

===[[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers vs. X-Men]]===
While the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] were massing and traveling to Utopia, Hope was training rigorously with Cyclops. After Cyclops pushed her too far, she manifested the Phoenix Fire Bird and sent him flying. Their training session was interrupted by the arrival of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] who demanded that the X-Men turn over Hope to the Avengers. Cyclops refused and blasted him which caused the Avengers to attack.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 1}} Hope was taken out of the battle but dispatched her Lights teammates and Wolverine and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] who came to capture her, and proceeded to flee Utopia hoping to lure away the Avengers.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 2}} She scrambled her signals which made her seem to be in five places at once to prevent the X-Men or the Avengers from finding her. She tracked down Wolverine who was left in [[Antarctica]] by Captain America and offered him a deal. She was planning to travel to the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]] in order to confront the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] but wanted Wolverine with her to stop her if she lost control. Wolverine betrayed her, however, and summoned the Avengers and shortly afterward the X-Men arrived. Before the two groups could start fighting, the Phoenix finally arrived.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 4}}

After being attacked by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], the Phoenix breaks into five pieces and chooses Cyclops, Emma Frost, [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]], [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] and Colossus as its hosts. The unconscious Hope is taken back to Earth by the [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]] who go about reshaping the Earth into a better place to live for all.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 5}}

Hope continued to hear the Phoenix's voice calling to her, however, and when Cyclops asks her if she would accept the Phoenix Force now, she eagerly responds yes. Cyclops doesn't give it to her, however, stating that she proved herself unworthy when she denied it on the Moon. The Avengers broke into to Utopia in order to capture her so as to better study the Phoenix Force, but they were stopped by the arrival of Cyclops and Emma. The [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] showed up as well however and Hope voluntarily went with her.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 6}}
[[File:Hope Summers (Earth-616) from Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 12 0001.jpg|left|thumb|140px]]

She was taken to the mystical city of [[K'un-Lun]] and received the prophecy that she will be trained by Spider-Man who was puzzled as to what he was supposed to be teaching her. She was initially outraged over her new teacher's lack of knowledge and seriousness but was quickly won over and began to listen after he told her how he got his powers and that his uncle always told him "With great power comes great responsibility".{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 27}}

Hope's training was interrupted, however, when Cyclops, now empowered due to receiving more Phoenix portions after two more of his fellow Phoenixes fell, managed to penetrate the wall between K'un-Lun and the regular world. Cyclops made short work of all the Avengers that opposed him, and even managed to defeat [[Shou-Lao (Earth-616)|Shou-Lao]], the dragon that gives K'un-Lun its power. Hope managed to stop him by copying both the dragon's flames and the Scarlet Witch's hex bolts, and used them to incapacitate him and send him to the Moon. Afterward, when Cyclops became Dark Phoenix, Hope and the Scarlet Witch fought for a while because Hope believed Wanda ruined her life when she decreased the mutant race during the [[House of M]] event. Captain America and Iron Man broke up the fight and later created a plan to defeat Cyclops. During the fight, Hope and Wanda went head to head with Cyclops by using chaos magic with Shou-Lao kung fu to hurt Cyclops. [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] came to Cyclops from the [[White Hot Room]] to help him let go of the Phoenix Force. When it did, Hope became its host and took away the flames of Dark Phoenix, becoming the White Phoenix. Wanda talked to Hope to understand her true purpose as the Phoenix. With their powers combined, they both said "No More Phoenix", which broke the original spell "No More Mutants" and brought back the mutant race.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 11|12}}{{clear}}
===Consequences===
After the events of Avengers vs X-Men, she received a letter from her adoptive father Cable telling her at the end not to go looking for him, but burned the letter. Captain America and the Scarlet Witch went to her and suggested that she could go to the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. She agrees, believing that this will give her a normal life since completing her destiny as Phoenix. After arriving at the school, she was thinking about the Five Lights, and how they would know what to do after the time as Phoenix. In the night, she began sneaking around parts of the world looking for her father Cable. When Utopia fell into the seas she went to take a look, and was confronted by Namor about why she was there, to which she replied the truth. Hope asked how he was after he had possessed the Phoenix and destroyed [[Wakanda]]. He said it was just war, and he did what he had to do, angering her into leaving him behind. Continuing her search, she was confronted by the Avengers, who asked where she had been. Before she could respond, the talk was interrupted when [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]] said there was a prison escape that led Cyclops to be freed, engineered by [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]], [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], and Magik. She returned to the school and found a note to look out the window. She saw Cable for the first time after the event and said he will be there for her when the time is right, after which they said their goodbyes and she went to sleep at last.{{r|AvX: Consequences Vol 1 5}}

===[[Cable and X-Force Vol 1|Cable and X-Force]]===
[[File:Cable and X-Force Vol 1 13 Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]
Hope had been living a 'normal life' for four weeks. She spoke to a psychiatrist named Doctor Townley due to The Avengers making the sessions mandatory. She now had foster parents that watched twenty-seven hours of television a week, and their excessive smiling made her uncomfortable. She felt that her foster parents couldn't compare to Cable.{{r|Cable and X-Force Vol 1 1}} [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] was speaking to [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom Boom]] via communication link about how she made a sucker out of a client to pay her three times the amount for a job to rescue a professor from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] she considered "easy money". It turned out that Hope had hacked into her files, and beat her to the punch. Domino was surprised to see Hope again. Hope made a deal to trade the missing professor for Domino's using her luck powers to find Cable. Domino and Hope located Cable in a junkyard in [[Nebraska (State)|Nebraska]]. She became enraged and mimicked Cable's telekinesis. She explained that while she was looking all over the world for him, he was there and didn't bother to reach out to her the minute he woke up from his coma. Cable responded with "I miss you too kid. Every damned day". Hope's rage stopped and she hugged him. Suddenly Cable had another headache and Hope saw visions of a future event, Cable passed out and awakened later on, only to see Hope's vision play out on television.{{r|{{cl|Cable and X-Force Vol 1 10}}-[[Cable and X-Force Vol 1 14|14]]}}

Hope later joined Cable's X-Force and fought with him against [[Nathaniel Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]] and confronted Bishop, who was back in the present and had become a member of [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|another X-Force team]]. At the end of the battle, the two teams were disbanded.{{r|{{cl|Cable and X-Force Vol 1 15}}-[[Cable and X-Force Vol 1 19|19]]}}

At the graduation day of the Jean Grey school, Hope made a surprise visit to see Idie.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 2}}

===New X-Force and MeMe===
After a huge disaster occurred in [[Alexandria (Virginia)|Alexandria]], [[Virginia (State)|Virginia]], Hope became comatose due to the nature of the blast. This led to her father Cable to reform another X-Force team. During the team's first outing, they were able to save a new mutant named [[MeMe (Mutant) (Earth-616)|MeMe]], who also was stuck in a catatonic state. Unbeknownst to them, MeMe was brain dead but still alive to the point where Hope was able to mimic her mutant abilities of electromagnetic transference and decided to impersonate MeMe in order to stay close to her father.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 1}}

She began to help X-Force as a digital interface to override the doors' locking mechanism with her [[Homo superior|mutant]] abilities, which allowed Cable to access the door so that he could eliminate their target [[Qareen (Earth-616)|Qareen]], in exchange for the information from [[Fiqh (Earth-616)|Fiqh]] about who was turning mutants into weapons.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 2}}

MeMe next shows up with her X-Force teammates in northwestern [[Brazil]] to locate a mutant named [[Antonio Aggasiz (Earth-616)|Antonio Aggasiz]] who was targeted by arms dealer [[Yevgeny Malevitch (Earth-616)|Volga]] for his dimensional teleportation abilities. Unable to scan the compound due to psi-dampeners, MeMe and the team infiltrate the place using her abilities to hack into and override the computer systems and doors, while [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] handled the soldiers.{{Citation}}

As they entered the building, they noticed multiple mutants being held captive but no Antonio. MeMe digitally scanned the remaining areas until she located his signal in a separate room. They came in to see a frightened and paranoid Antonio strapped down to a chair while screaming out the name Volga. Volga then showed up behind X-Force taking every member out including MeMe with concentrated energy blasts. After that he incinerated Antonio on the spot before they could get him to talk.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 3}}

After being captured by Volga, X-Force was rescued by Cable and [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Dr. Nemesis]]. As the group retreated back to their base Psylocke was able to telepathically read MeMe's mind revealing that she was really Hope in disguise. Hope begged her not to tell her father because this was the only way she could be close to him.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 6}}

After Fantomex became crazy by his compulsion to become the best there is, X-Force found Mojo, who revealed to Cable that Hope has been disguised as MeMe all along.{{r|{{cl|X-Force Vol 4 13}}-[[X-Force Vol 4 14|14]]}} After Fantomex was defeated, Cable left the team and Hope became the new leader.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 15}}

===Meeting Jean Grey===
When the time-displaced Jean Grey had a vision of the Phoenix Force coming for her, she tried to reach out to those who had contact and hosted the cosmic entity before and Hope was one of them. Hope was caught by the Reavers and one of them tried to make her into one of them. However, Hope was saved by the arrival of Jean. Both of them fought the Reavers while noting to each other that they can not see why is it people always say that they look alike.{{r|Jean Grey Vol 1 2}}

The duo were joined by [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]], [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Kid Omega]], Colossus, and Magik. Quentin showed Jean his, Colossus', Rachel's and Hope's mindscape in order to make her understand the Phoenix Force better. However, none of it was much of help.{{r|Jean Grey Vol 1 2}}

===Post Disassembled===
[[File:Cain Marko (Earth-616) and Hope Summers (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 20 001.png|right|thumb|200px|Hope and Juggernaut vs Fabian Cortez]]
Hope later resurfaced as part of the [[Mutant Liberation Front (Earth-616)|Mutant Liberation Front]] along with Banshee. She joined the MLF because she thought it was the best way to protect other mutants. During a confrontation with the X-Men, she accidentally shot Cyclops in the eye.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 15}} After a fight with the newest incarnation of the Brotherhood of Mutants, Hope rejoined the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 16}}

===Krakoa===
After the establishment of the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] Hope became a member of [[Five (Earth-616)|"The Five"]], a group of mutants established by Charles Xavier with the goal of resurrecting all dead mutants. The five mutants, together, were able to create new clones of the deceased mutants, restoring their bodies, their powers, and their memories as they were at the time of their deaths. Hope's powers allowed The Five to operate at both their peak and in unison. 

Xavier tasked The Five with resurrecting [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]], [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]], [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]], [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Penance]], [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] who died stopping the creation of Nimrod.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}} The Five had previously resurrected other long deceased mutants, such as [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], and [[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]] and [[Esme Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Esme Cuckoo]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}}

The Five were seen partying following the recognition of Krakoa as a sovereign nation by the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] and the first meeting of the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}}{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 6}}

During the [[Hellfire Gala]] Hope participated in the terraforming of [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]] with other Omega Level Mutants. She assisted [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]] and [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]] by supplying them with enough energy for the completion of their part of the process.{{r|Planet-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}}

'''Power Manipulation:''' Hope is an '''[[Mutant Power Level Classification#Omega Level Mutants|Omega level]] [[Homo superior|mutant]]'''{{r|X-Men: Phoenix Force Handbook Vol 1 1}}{{r|House of X #1}} with ability to manipulate powers of other mutants in her close proximity,{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}} but only mutants.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 0}} 
* '''''Power Mimicry:''''' Hope's primary power allows her to copy the powers of any nearby mutant. Unlike other mutants with similar abilities, such as [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], Hope does not need to make physical contact and the person who's powers are copied suffers no ill effects. Hope seems to be subconsciously aware of any power she copies and is able to utilize it immediately, without any need to learn how to use them or even to see them in action first.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming Vol 1 2}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 526}} The powers she copies are at their full capacity{{r|X-Men: Phoenix Force Handbook Vol 1 1}} and she has full control over them{{r|X-Force Vol 3 28}} (regardless of how much the original wielder controls them and how well developed their powers are). Hope does not have any known limit on how many powers she can copy at the same time, but wielding multiple powers simultaneously is taxing on her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 541}} The powers she duplicate fade away due to time, distance and usage.{{r|Cable and X-Force Vol 1 9}}{{r|Cable and X-Force Vol 1 15}}
** '''''Power Absorption Immunity:''''' Hope herself is immune to power absorption abilities, as demonstrated when [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]]'s power had no effect on her.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 207}}{{r|X-Men: Phoenix Force Handbook Vol 1 1}}
* '''''Power Regulation:''''' Hope can stabilize the powers of other mutants and bring them to their most optimal state. Hope first used this ability to help the [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]], whose powers were unstable after activation.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 526|529}}{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 3}}{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 7}} Later on it became crucial to her role in [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]], as she continuously supported other members to keep their powers in peak condition, so that every resurrection was performed perfectly.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}} She also assisted two other Omega Level Mutants — [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]] and [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]] — by supplying them with enough energy for completion of their part of [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]]'s terraformation.{{r|Planet-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}}
** '''''Power Augmentation:''''' Hope has the ability to aid mutants by temporarily unlocking the full potential of their powers and augmenting them.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}{{r|Planet-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}}
* '''''Power Synergizing:''''' Hope has demonstrated the ability to aid other mutants in using their powers in synergy. One of her roles among the Five is to synchronize their powers and to help them operate in unison.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}
* '''''Power Tracking:''''' Hope can track down a mutant by sensing their power. She used this ability to find and catch [[Gabriel Cohuelo (Earth-616)|Velocidad]], when he himself wasn't able to control his powers, and when [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|telepaths]] were unable to pinpoint his exact location. It is unknown whether this applied only to the Lights, or if Hope can use this ability to track any mutant.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 527}}
* '''''Power Bestowment:''''' First shown when she activated the [[Lights (Earth-616)|Five Lights]].{{r|X-Men: Second Coming Vol 1 2}} Hope later used this power — greatly augmented by the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] — to activate a multitude of new mutants all around the world.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 12}}

'''Psychic Energy and Undetectability:''' It is also notable that after Hope's initial detection at birth, [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]] blew up.{{r|X-Men: Messiah Complex #1}} After repairs were made the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Three-in-One]] tried to search for her because she had been kidnapped by the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] yet she somehow became undetectable by mutant-detecting equipment. It is possible, however, that she was merely being shielded by Cable, as he was with her from the time she left the hospital until he left to stop the [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod-Series Sentinels]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 27|28}} Hope was again able to disguise her signal when both the X-Men and [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] were looking across the globe for her, through the use of a device Cable taught her to build.{{r|{{cl|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 3}}-[[Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 4|4]]}}

'''Lights' Influence and Bonding:''' Soon after Hope's return to the [[Earth-616|present day]], [[Lights (Earth-616)|five]] new [[X-Gene]]s manifested across the globe. Besides her own birth, these were the first new manifestations of [[Homo superior|mutant powers]] since [[Decimation|M-Day]].{{r|X-Men: Second Coming Vol 1 2}} More new mutants have continued to manifest, but at a slower rate than the original five.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 6}} The Lights were shown to be linked to each other and to the new activations, with Hope able to exert a degree of control over them. Hope has exhibited both subconscious low level of persuasion or manipulation over the lights, and when pushed, the ability to take control over them entirely.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 8}}{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 11}}{{r|{{cl|Generation Hope Vol 1 15}}-[[Generation Hope Vol 1 17|17]]}} All the Lights were also affected by the suicide of [[Zeeshan (Earth-616)|Zeeshan]].{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 9}} That situation was witnessed by Laurie and [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Kenji]],{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 8}} and later by [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kate Pryde]].{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 12}} Also, when the [[Sixth Light (Earth-616)|Sixth Light]] activated, all of the Lights were able to sense it.{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 6}} 

[[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]] later developed a similar bond; they became an inseparable unit and preferred to always stay together. It is unknown if this was caused by Hope or was simply a result of them bonding through the shared use of their powers.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}

*'''Concussive Force Blasts:''' Hope has wielded this energy to project beams of immense concussive force.{{Citation}}
*'''Resurrection Force:''' Despite being fatally stabbed by the Shi'Ar Death Commandos, Hope was almost immediately revived by the Phoenix Force, with all of her injuries healed.{{Citation}}
*'''Immortality:''' Hope cannot die, as the Phoenix will resurrect her if she sustains a fatal injury.{{Citation}}
*'''Phoenix Force Avatar:''' When Hope finally became one with Phoenix Force she was able to use all of the Phoenix's powers. Though Hope was Phoenix it is unsure how strong she is compared to previous Phoenix hosts, such as Jean Grey. While bonded with the Phoenix, Hope gained the title White Phoenix, implying some connection to the Phoenix or Jean who took the title White Phoenix Of The Crown.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #12}}

| Abilities               = Hope has learned to fight from Cable by observing him. Hope was further tutored in survival techniques, various hand-held firearms and blades, stealth, CPR, combat first-aid, warfare strategy, and some gymnastics.
| Strength                = Possesses the strength of a normal girl her age, height, and build who engages in extreme regular exercise (although this can vary, depending on what powers she has access to)
| Weaknesses              = 
* '''Lack Of Control:''' Hope's mutant powers are not fully under control and generates power levels that are potentially dangerous to people and environments around her.
* '''Power Limitation:''' Hope's ability to mimic superpowers is limited to [[Homo superior|mutants]] only.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 0}} Therefore, she cannot duplicate the abilities of non-mutant superpowered beings (i.e. [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]], or the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]). Her duplicated powers do fade due to time, distance, and usage.{{r|Cable and X-Force Vol 1 9}}{{r|Cable and X-Force Vol 1 15}} However, there were instances of Hope wielding powers from non-mutants. Such as the Scarlet Witch (who was believed to be a mutant at the time) and Shou-Lao the Undying (a mystical, immortal dragon).{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 11|12}}

| Equipment               = 
| Transportation          = Formerly [[X-Men Blackbird]], [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]], [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]], [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable's]] time device, Terraforming Pods, ''[[Ensabahnur I]]''.
| Weapons                 = * [[Psimitar]]{{r|Jean Grey Vol 1 9}}{{r|X-Men: The Exterminated Vol 1 1}}
* Various firearms

| Notes                   = * Hope Summers was first ''"prophesied"'' in {{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 36}}, her birth first mentioned in {{cl|X-Men: Messiah Complex #1}}, first seen on-panel in {{cl|X-Men Vol 2 205}} and named by [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] in {{cl|Cable Vol 2 10}}.
* Hope has red hair, green eyes and a "close" relationship with the Phoenix. This has led some fans to assume that she is [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] reincarnated, though this has not been confirmed in the comics.
** [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Oya]] thought that Hope looked a bit like [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]].{{r|Generation Hope Vol 1 10}}
** When Hope finally met the young [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], they both commented that they didn't see the resemblance.{{r|Jean Grey Vol 1 2}}
** The theory was refuted once and for all when Jean was resurrected.
* As Hope displayed signs of the Phoenix as an infant, it is possible that her birth was brought about by the Phoenix Force itself, in order to prepare a host for itself.
