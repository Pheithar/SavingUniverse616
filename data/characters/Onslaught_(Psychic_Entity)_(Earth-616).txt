===Origin===
Onslaught was a sentient psionic entity created from the consciousness of two extremely powerful [[Homo superior|mutants]]: [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]] and [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]. During a battle between the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and Magneto's [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] slashed Magneto, and in response, Magneto ripped out the [[Adamantium]] from Wolverine's bones, severely injuring him to the point that his healing factor had trouble healing him. For Professor Xavier, this was the last straw. Having tolerated every one of Magneto's evil actions, even his recent actions that had killed hundreds of people across the globe in a single day, he finally snapped. He used his [[Telepathy|telepathic]] powers to shut down Magneto's mind, rendering him catatonic.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 25}} During the psionic contact, Magneto's anger, grief, and lust for vengeance entered Professor Xavier's consciousness; commingling with every long-suppressed negative feeling the professor had endured during the last 30 years. This aggregation resulted in a separate personality forming within Professor Xavier: the being known as '''Onslaught'''.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 104}}

Onslaught remained dormant for some time. Gradually, Xavier's frustration with his dream of mutant-human peace and harmony began to increase, exacerbated by the daily growth of anti-mutant hysteria, the deaths of dozens of mutants from the lethal [[Legacy Virus]], and his own failed attempt to rehabilitate the mutant sociopath called [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]]. Xavier reached his breaking point when anti-mutant humans killed a young mutant near the grounds of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]], the secret base of the X-Men. It was at this point that Onslaught awakened within Xavier and began to manifest himself to others.{{r|X-Men Prime Vol 1 1}}

===[[Onslaught (Event)|Onslaught]]===
Following an encounter with the mystically-empowered criminal called the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] (Xavier's stepbrother, Cain Marko),{{r|Uncanny X-Men #322}} Onslaught invaded a government-sanctioned [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] base. He downloaded the current specifications for the mutant-hunting androids and erased portions of the memories of the employees working in the clandestine factory.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 46}} Soon after, while hiding in Xavier's mind, Onslaught encountered the telepathic, telekinetic [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]]. He pulled the Professor's body from the astral plane, a feat never before achieved. Through X-Man's actions, Onslaught was able to escape Xavier's mind and move independently.{{r|X-Man #16}} After taking full possession of the Professor's mind and body, Onslaught-as-Xavier called together the X-Men. When they resisted his plan to turn them into soldiers fighting a total war against humans, Onslaught revealed himself to the X-Men and attempted to destroy the outlaw adventurers. The time-tossed mutant soldier called [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]], remembering childhood stories of a traitor betraying and killing the X-Men, began to realize that the guilty party was Xavier as Onslaught. Bishop rescued his teammates. Taking Xavier's body with him, Onslaught escaped.{{r|Onslaught X-Men Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Onslaught (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 53.png|thumb|left]]
Once free, Onslaught created a childlike psionic projection named Charles to gain the trust of young [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]], a mutant possessing the latent power to alter reality. Onslaught succeeded in capturing the child despite a rescue attempt by Franklin's parents, [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] and [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]], members of the legendary super-team known as the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 414}} Now carrying Franklin and Xavier, Onslaught captured [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]], intending to use his raw psionic power to fuel Onslaughtâ€™s plans to transform the human race into a collective consciousness. Onslaught returned to New York, reprogramming the Sentinel robots to obey his commands and form a protective circle around Manhattan, sealing off the island from the rest of the world.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 55}}

The X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], Earth's Mightiest Heroes, challenged Onslaught. Their first confrontation with the entity and his minions resulted in the rescue of a now-powerless Xavier, who retained his usual benevolent personality. Onslaught evolved after Xavier was rescued and now existed as pure psionic energy contained within his armor.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #336}} A second and final confrontation occurred at his Central Park citadel. After a number of attempts to free Franklin and X-Man from Onslaught's seemingly impervious armor, the heroes regrouped. Onslaught then used Franklin's powers to create a second sun that would destroy the heroes and Manhattan. During their next assault, X-Man [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Phoenix (Jean Grey)]] used her telepathy to turn off the part of the monstrous [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]'s mind that contained the rationality of his alter ego, Dr. Bruce Banner. The now-savage Hulk, possessed of a near-animal intelligence and unbelievable strength, battled Onslaught and tore apart his armor. The resulting explosion of psionic energy separated Banner and the Hulk, and Onslaught was left as an energy being, immune to physical harm.{{r|Onslaught Marvel Universe Vol 1 1}}

The Avenger known as the Mighty [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], Asgardian God of Thunder, master of the storm and lightning, flew into the energy being, disrupting Onslaught's form. Realizing that Thor's efforts alone were insufficient to destroy their adversary, the non-mutant members of the Avengers and the Fantastic Four entered the energy field, and the Hulk-less Banner and [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Dr. Doom]] (albeit reluctantly) followed. The X-Men were unable to do likewise, as it was theorized that if Onslaught, a being of mutant origin, came to possess a mutant host, he would then become unstoppable. Onslaught dissolved, seemingly destroyed, along with all the heroes who had thrown themselves into the rift. The remaining Sentinels were disabled, Franklin and X-Man were rescued, and Manhattan was returned to normal.{{r|Onslaught Marvel Universe #1}} Later, however, it was revealed that the Avengers and the Fantastic Four did not die, as had been surmised. Rather, the heroes were reborn in a pocket universe created by Franklin.{{r|Heroes Reborn: The Return Vol 1 1}} The Avengers and the Fantastic Four returned to their rightful home months later, possessing only hazy memories of their time on [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Counter-Earth]].{{r|Heroes Reborn: The Return Vol 1 4}}

===Onslaught Reborn===
[[File:Onslaught Reborn Vol 1 1 Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]
After the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] depowered most mutants on earth,{{r|House of M Vol 1 7|8}} a large mass of energy was released into space, where it awakened [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]] and [[Armando MuÃ±oz (Earth-616)|Darwin]].{{citation}} Later, the big ball of mutant energy was controlled by [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]], who returned to earth, fused with the [[Michael Pointer (Earth-616)|Michael Pointer]], and was then defeated by the combined efforts of the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]].{{citation}} That energy eventually returned to earth a second time and gained physical form as a recombined Onslaught.{{r|Onslaught Reborn Vol 1 1}}

Immediately seeking out Franklin Richards and failing to kill him through the mind-controlled [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and Mister Fantastic, Onslaught quickly cornered the child in his bedroom, where Franklin once more used a toy ball as a focus to escape into a world that was, for the most part, an exact copy of the Counter-Earth he had created. There, with the help of recreated versions of the [[Fantastic Four (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], the [[Avengers (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Avengers]], and their allies and foes, Franklin battled Onslaught. The fight took them to the [[Baxter Building]], where [[Rebecca Barnes (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Bucky]] sacrificed herself to knock Onslaught into the [[Negative Zone]]. Later, Bucky mysteriously found herself back on [[Earth-616]] while Onslaught remained trapped in the Negative Zone. He was seen floating near [[Wonderland]], curious of its purpose.{{r|Onslaught Reborn Vol 1 1|5}}

===Onslaught Unleashed===
When both the [[Secret Avengers (Black Ops Unit) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] and the [[Young Allies (Modern) (Earth-616)|Young Allies]] went to [[Colombia]] to investigate a [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]] facility, Onslaught emerged from the Negative Zone and possessed Rikki's body. He revealed soon afterwards that the real Rikki had in fact died in the Negative Zone, and that the Rikki he was possessing was nothing but a construct he made so he could pull himself back to Earth. This revelation prompted Rikki to fight back only to prove Onslaught wrong. Eventually, Rikki had [[Greg Willis (Earth-616)|Gravity]] kill her so that Onslaught could not return and destroy the Earth.{{r|Onslaught Unleashed Vol 1 1|4}}

[[File:Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616) from Way of X Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|As the Patchwork Man]]
===Onslaught Revelation===
Some time after Professor X revealed the existence of the mutant island nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] to the whole world, the anti-mutant organization [[Orchis (Earth-616)|Orchis]] introduced Onslaught in their society as an "invasive exotic" that would accelerate its fall,{{r|Way of X Vol 1 1|2}} anchoring him inside the broken mind of the mutant [[Lost (Earth-616)|Lost]] to limit his power and allow him to get into the island undetected.{{r|X-Men: The Onslaught Revelation Vol 1 1}} As the "Patchwork Man," Onslaught preyed on the negative emotions of mutants, amplifying them to the point of causing self-destructive behaviors and savage cultural movements among Krakoans,{{r|Way of X Vol 1 1|2}} all the while feeding on the parts of mutant psyches lost during resurrection and leaving a part of himself to fill the gaps.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 5}}

The Patchwork Man's presence eventually caught the attention of Xavier, who sent [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] to investigate the threat. Both Xavier and Nightcrawler initially believed the Patchwork Man to be Xavier's erstwhile son, [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]], but that suspicion was put to rest after Nightcrawler saved Legion from Orchis, which led Legion to confide to Nightcrawler that the Patchwork Man was actually Onslaught.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 1|2}} Legion, working with [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]] and [[Shen Xorn (Earth-616)|Zorn]], set a trap for Onslaught by merging the minds of [[Alani Ryan (Earth-616)|Loa]] and [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]] to entice him. Though the bait worked, Onslaught was able to escape and caused a fight between [[Fabian Cortez (Earth-616)|Fabian Cortez]] and Lost at [[Miranda Leevald (Earth-616)|Stacy X]]'s orphanage.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 3}} Later, Onslaught possessed every mutant in the [[Green Lagoon]] during a meeting between Legion and his father, forcing David and the Xorn brothers to kill everyone there in order to free them from his control.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 4}}

Legion eventually realized what Onslaught was doing and told Nightcrawler, who, in a moment of epiphany granted by Cortez's augmentation powers, saw a way to defeat the entity. However, that solution was lost when Nightcrawler sacrificed himself to prevent [[Phobos (Moon)|Phobos]] from falling on [[Mars (Planet)|Arakko (Mars)]]. Already knowing that would happen, Nightcrawler saved Cortez so he could trigger the epiphany again after his resurrection. Having possessed most mutants in the island,{{r|Way of X Vol 1 5}} Onslaught threw a party to end all the parties: the Cruciball. By the end of the Cruciball, everyone would kill everyone else just for the thrill of it, but they wouldn't be resurrected, as Onslaught planned to use Xavier to delete all the mind backups.<!-- {{r|X-Men: The Onslaught Revelation Vol 1 1}} -->

[[File:Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616) from X-Men The Onslaught Revelation Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|right|Merged with his progenitors]]
Meanwhile, a resurrected Nightcrawler approached Cortez to re-trigger his epiphany and went on to rescue [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]], taking her to the [[Altar (House of L)|Altar]] created by Legion to free her from Onslaught's grasp. With Pixie's help, Nightcrawler was able to do the same to everyone else, thus averting the Cruciball's gruesome end before it came to pass. After Cortez cured Lost of her hatred towards him for killing her parents years ago, Onslaught was unanchored from her mind. He possessed Magneto and Xavier again soon afterwards, renewing his attack on the Krakoans. Even with his powers augmented by his first hosts, Onslaught was no match for the communion of all Krakoans, who embraced him instead of fighting him. Grinded, Onslaught was finally crushed by Nightcrawler, ending his threat once and for all.{{r|X-Men: The Onslaught Revelation Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = Onslaught possessed all of the mutant abilities of his progenitors [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] and [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]. He later also added the powers of the [[Mutant Power Level Classification#Omega Level & Omega Class|Omega-Level mutants]] [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]] and [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]] to his, making him incredibly more powerful. In effect, with few appearances while in his prime, Onslaught managed to create a second sun from nothing and physically match a Banner-less [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]].

'''Astral Plane Tap:''' Ability to tap into the enormous psychic resources of the astral plane in order to manipulate matter and energy.
* '''Astral Travel:''' Capable of forging psi-links to travel in astral form.
* '''Material Astral Projection:''' Give substance to astral energy to solidify psychic forms or forge protective psi-armor and even pull the astral projections of other telepaths into the physical world.
* '''Psychometry:''' Can read residual thought imprints left on objects touched by people.
* '''Dimensional Sense:''' Capable of sensing dimensional rifts or anomalies.

'''Telepathy:''' Onslaught is able to read minds and project his own thoughts into the minds of others in vast distances with little to no resistance from even the most powerful telepaths.
* '''Telepathic Illusion:''' Ability to create realistic telepathic illusions and cause people to experience events which are not actually occurring.
* '''Telepathic Camouflage:''' Ability to mask himself, and other peoples' presence from those around him. Can telepathically disguise himself, making his appearance to those around him quite different (changing the appearance of clothing, as well as more involved disguises). 
* '''Mind Blast:''' Ability to place large amounts of information in another mind. 
* '''Mind Control:''' Ability to control the minds of others upon mere concentration. This power can also allow him to completely shut down several peoples' minds, making it appear as if time has stopped. Onslaught's telepathic control was so powerful that he was one of the few to completely control [[Hulk]] (albeit in a calm state), despite the green goliath's immense resistance to psychic manipulation.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 444}} [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] and [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] are particularly vulnerable to Onslaught's control, since it was born of them.{{r|X-Men: The Onslaught Revelation Vol 1 1}}
* '''Mind Possession:''' Ability to possess the mind of another, and use that being's body as his own.
* '''Mind Alteration:''' Ability to alter the minds of others by force of will.
* '''Mental Amnesia:''' Ability to cause loss of particular memories, and amnesia in another person or even in a group of people. Powerful enough to make a person have total mental paralysis.
* '''Mental Shield:''' Ability to erect a psychic barrier for protection of the telepath and of other minds that is sufficient to protect him from other Omega-Level telepaths. In summary, it refers to the erection of mental blocks preventing the free access to the conscious and subconscious mind of someone.
* '''Psionic Blasts:''' Can project psionic force bolts which have no physical effects but which can affect a victim's mind so as to cause the victim pain or unconsciousness and can even kill an adversary. Even without being fully evolved, his psionic blasts affected Juggernaut even though Juggernaut was wearing his helmet which had protected him from very powerful psychics, slowing him down enough for him to hit Juggernaut.
* '''Astral Projection:''' Ability to Astral Travel and communicate with others astrally through his own will, or through contact with the thoughts and memories of others. In the astral realm, he can use his powers to create "ectoplasmic" objects. He cannot engage in long range astral projection on the earthly plane.
* '''Mental Detection:''' Can sense the presence of another superhuman mutant within a vast but as yet undefined radius of himself by perceiving the distinctive mental radiations emitted by such a being.

'''Telekinesis:''' Telekinetically, Onslaught is capable of very fine control over objects; he can disassemble complex devices explosively (separating every last component, such as screws, nuts, circuit boards, etc.), and just as quickly and easily assemble complex devices. This also has enabled him to even attain awareness and control over objects as small as individual electrons in an atom. For instance, Onslaught could detect if a seal was hermetic, or not, by checking for the presence of penetrating oxygen molecules. He could even detect and discern individual oxygen molecules, and determine the atomic weight of molecules, by the amount of atoms present. On larger levels, Onslaught can levitate great weights, into the tons, but his upper limit has remained undisclosed.
* '''Psionic Spikes:''' Ability to create destructive psionic spikes that destroy the physical objects that the spikes come into contact with.
* '''Telekinetic Force-Fields:''' Ability to create protective force shields that could deflect even the most powerful of attacks (even filter bacteria from the air). The upper limits of this ability remain unknown, but it is believed that he could probably protect himself from harm at the ground zero detonation of a 1 kiloton nuclear warhead (4.18 terajoules of energy from the heat, concussion, and radiation effects) with ease. Onslaught has also displayed such control over the fields as to shape them precisely, even to conform very closely to his bodyâ€™s form. There does not appear to be any correlation between field strength and the thickness of the telekinetic fields.
* '''Concussive Blasts:''' Can project his telekinetic energies as powerful blast beams directed from his brain that could apparently affect matter with concussive force.
* '''Flight:''' By levitating himself, he can fly at incredible speeds.
* '''Intangibility:''' Can phase through solid matter by mentally shifting his molecules around another object's as he moves forward.
* '''Telekinetic Holograms:''' His mental fine motor skills are so acute that he can mentally manipulate dust particles and water vapor to refract light-waves and create holograms.

'''Magnetokinesis:''' Onslaught has the power to shape and manipulate magnetic fields that exist naturally or artificially. He can draw magnetic force from outside himself, or can also generate magnetic force within himself. Onslaught's power is psionic and physiological in nature. He can lift, move, and alter objects. Onslaught can project metal at an unparalleled velocity and place tremendous pressure on metallic substances to liquefy and reshape them, manipulate the iron-enriched blood-flow to one's brain to induce aneurysms or unconsciousness, redirect the flow of blood through one's brain to alter thoughts and perceptions or blank a person's mind completely, levitate a person or control a person's actions by manipulating the iron in their bloodstream, remove the iron from the bloodstream entirely through a person's skin, control ferrous particles in the atmosphere, alter the Earth's magnetic field which extends into space as the magnetosphere, prodigiously increase his own strength to superhuman levels, and achieve a wide range of other effects.
* '''Magnetic Force-Fields:''' Onslaught usually protects himself with a personal force field that he can quickly expand to protect large areas. His force field has withstood the effects of multiple nuclear weapons, volcanic eruption, the depths of space and attacks from multiple Avengers or X-Men, including Phoenix, Thor, and even Galactus.
* '''Organic Iron Manipulation:''' Onslaught can control the iron within any organic matter which allows him to have full control over an opponent's body. Onslaught has also demonstrated the ability to control the blood flow within one's body thus causing them to die a painful or even quick death.
* '''Electromagnetic Spectrum Manipulation:''' Onslaught has some ability to project or manipulate any form of energy that is related to the electromagnetic spectrum. He can fire and absorb bolts of electricity and magnetic force, reverse lasers and other forms of radiation or energy, create enough intense heat as infrared radiation to level a city, and become invisible by deflecting visible light around his body. Heat or infrared radiation, is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes visible light, radio waves, ultraviolet light, gamma rays, and x-rays. Onslaught can project any of these. Onslaught can maintain total control of an entire planet's electromagnetic field and can manipulate it accordingly. He has also dispersed a "flame cage" created by the Human Torch, but whether he had simply expanded his personal force field or employed something else entirely is unclear. Onslaught once used his powers to create a stable wormhole between two points in space.
**  '''Electromagnetic Sight:''' Onslaught can perceive the world around himself as patterns of magnetic and electrical energy. He can perceive the natural magnetic auras surrounding living beings.
**  '''Electromagnetic Pulses:''' He also has creative uses of his powers such as using his telekinesis to channel the Earth's magnetic field through the electro-current of his brain and generate devastating electromagnetic pulses.

'''Superhuman Strength:''' Onslaught possesses vast superhuman strength of unknown limits. Onslaught can lift well in excess of 100 tons easily without using his psionic, magnetic, telekinetic or reality altering powers to increase his strength. While using those powers to enhance his strength, the upper limits of Onslaught's strength are unimaginable. While not fully evolved, he demonstrated sufficient strength to overpower a fully powered [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] and with one punch hit him with enough force to render him unconscious and send him flying from Canada to New Jersey. He later used his claws to easily skewer the Juggernaut and rip out his Cyttorak gem from his body. In his physical prime, Onslaught was capable to match an extremely enraged Banner-less Hulk, who is extraordinarily strong at this level. However, though this was an impressive feat, Onslaught was ultimately overpowered when the Hulk's rage reached a peak.

'''Impervious Armor:''' After complete physical evolution, Onslaughtâ€™s armor is nigh-invulnerable and near impossible to crack. The only exceptions were blows from an enraged Banner-less Hulk. However, some were capable to cause damage when Onslaught was in an unstable vulnerable mid-evolution flux. Finally, Onslaught used the Hulk's phenomenal strength to destroy his armor so that he could fully evolve. Hence it presumably means that he could not evolve by himself and the Hulk needed to overcome his powers.

'''Mutant Absorption:''' As a psychic entity, Onslaught had the ability to absorb any mutant into his being and thus permanently gain their powers for himself. X-Man and Franklin Richards were two mutants that he consumed to increase his vast power. Someone absorbed is completely dominated without consent when their willpower is inferior to the control exerted.
* '''Reality Manipulation:''' Ability to manipulate reality itself. Reality warping powers on a potentially cosmic scale. His abilities are so powerful that he can create "pocket" universes in alternate realities (A pocket universe is a cosmos that does not equal our own in size). However, he never demonstrated this level of power. Upon utilizing this power his maximum feat was to effectively create a second sun from nothing.
* '''Telepathic Immunity:''' Onslaught's mind is immune to all traces of telepathy due to his armor, especially to the duplicate of Magneto's helmet, so that it is effectively impossible to manipulate or read it. However, his telepathy is capable of exiting his armor, thus allowing his psionic power to be used on other beings.
| Abilities               = '''Super-Genius Intelligence:''' Onslaught possesses the combined genius intellects of both Charles Xavier and Magneto, granting him the same expertise and knowledge of each. With his super-genius intelligence and vast background, he could master his powers better than inexperienced wielders, such as the reality manipulator [[Freedom Ring]] or the infant Franklin Richards.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 8}}
* '''Formidable hand-to-hand combatant:''' Onslaught is possesses the knowledge of combat that both Xavier and Magneto have learned over the years.
* '''Strategist:''' Onslaught is particularly adept at using all of his powers in combat situations, typically preferring to combine certain aspects of different abilities for different situations. He is a skilled manipulator with and without his powers. He has tricked his enemies into doing exactly what he wished to do multiple times. When combining his genius level intellect and his telepathic abilities, Onslaught could detect any anomaly and immediately apply his counter-measures.

| Notes                   = * There is a continuity error in Onslaught's final defeat. It was theorized that if a mutant were to be absorbed by Onslaught's energy form, Onslaught would in turn become invincible. However, of the members of the Avengers who selflessly sacrificed themselves to defeat Onslaught, two were mutants:
** [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], although it has been suggested that her Hex powers somehow shielded her; later revealed by the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] not to be a mutant but a mutate "masquerading" as a mutant.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 2 2}}{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 2 4}}
** Although [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] was also absorbed, he is a [[Homo sapiens|human]] [[Homo superior|mutant]]/[[Homo mermanus|atlantean]] hybrid, which could have caused complications.
| Trivia                  = * Earliest possible genesis for Onslaught may hark as far back as {{cl|X-Men Vol 2 25}}. In the particular issue Professor X shuts down Magneto's mind following Magneto's extraction of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s [[Adamantium]] skeleton.
