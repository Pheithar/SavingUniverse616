===Arrival on Earth-616===
While under the influence of [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]], [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] of [[Earth-616]] committed a number of horrible acts. In a desperate move, the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] activated a time machine in [[Avengers Mansion]]'s hidden sub-basement. They hoped to find a young Tony Stark free of influence that could help them.{{r|Avengers: Timeslide Vol 1 1}}

On his way home with girlfriend [[Meredith McCall (Earth-96020)|Meredith McCall]], a young Tony Stark noticed a traffic jam all the way up to the Stark home. The car was pointed out by a boy named [[Peter Parker (Earth-96020)|Peter]] to his ''[[Benjamin Parker (Earth-96020)|Uncle Ben]]'' and ''[[Maybelle Parker (Earth-96020)|Aunt May]]''. Tony left the car and Meredith fearing something had happened. He ran in to find his parents missing, two Jarvises, and a handful of costumed heroes. [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-96020)|Jarvis]] explained where the heroes had come from, but that the evil [[Tobias (Space Phantom) (Earth-616)|Tobias]] had also followed them. Tobias killed the maid to draw out the Starks, then held them hostage when the Avengers confronted him. Tobias then left with the Starks looking for a way to leave the reality. Along the way, the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] was found by [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-96020)|Matt Murdock]], bumped into [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-96020)|Ben Grimm]] and [[Susan Storm (Earth-96020)|Susan Storm]], and finally arrived at the Mansion.{{r|Avengers: Timeslide Vol 1 1}}

Tony was shocked, but agreed to go with the heroes to rescue his parents. He was able to locate them in [[Latveria]]. [[Maria Stark (Earth-96020)|His mother]]'s cameo, a birthday gift that also doubled as a class project, contained an emergency signal device. Tony grabbed a prototype gauntlet he was working on and they flew to [[Castle Doom (Doomstadt)|Castle Doom]]. The battle was fierce and Tony's parents were fatally wounded when part of the ceiling gave way. Tobias was able to escape with the help of his twin. A dying Maria told her son that whatever path he took would be the right one. Tony agreed to accompany the Avengers back to [[Earth-616]], wanting to avenge his parents. That world's [[Victor von Doom (Earth-96020)|Doctor Doom]] soon investigated. He allowed the heroes to leave using his time machine, recognizing [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Avengers: Timeslide Vol 1 1}}

===Life on Earth-616===
[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-96020) from Iron Man Vol 1 328 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]
Tony was able to access his elder self's Arctic bunker and found an armor waiting for him to put on. He was easily defeated and his heart seriously wounded battling the evil Iron Man. However, the sight seemed to free Iron Man from Immortus's control. He handed over a chestplate design that would save the young man's life, and then sacrificed himself.{{r|Iron Man #325}}{{r|Avengers #395}}

After heart surgery and donning the chestplate, the young Tony remained at Avengers Mansion. He enrolled in school, and said 'no relation' as people asked if he was named after or related to ''the'' Tony Stark. While there, he recognized [[Meredith McCall (Earth-616)|Meredith]], now a professor.{{r|Iron Man #326}}

Tony designed gauntlets to accompany his chestplate 'just in case', but did not seem interested in making a full armor. A new version of the [[Zodiac (First Sign) (Earth-616)|Zodiac]] attacked, sealing parts of the city off. The Avengers stopped them with Tony doing his best despite needing to conserve power for his chestplate.<ref>[[First Sign]] crossover.</ref>

The villainous [[Sloan Alden (Earth-616)|Frostbite]] later appeared at the school, looking to attack former colleagues including Meredith, his ex-wife. Tony cobbled together a full armor. A 'Therma-shield' stopped Frostbite and safely returned his victims to normal temperature. However, [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Jarvis]] made him return the parts he had 'borrowed' from the Avengers rooms. So Tony made a new armor that had holograms instead of being fully metallic. He battled alongside his elder self's old friend [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|James Rhodes]] against [[Stockpile (Earth-616)|Stockpile]] to prevent the theft of older Stark armors.{{r|Iron Man #327|331}}

During [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]]'s attack Tony accompanied the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] to the [[Wakandan Embassy (New York City)|Wakandan Embassy]] to construct psi-shields.{{r|Iron Man #332}} He was one of many who gave their lives to stop Onslaught, carrying [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] with him.{{r|Onslaught Marvel Universe}} When Teen Tony returned from the [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Heroes Reborn Universe]], [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]] merged him with the true Iron Man.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 2 #2000}}
