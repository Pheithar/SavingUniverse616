===Origins===
The [[Cotati]] were a pacifist race on [[Hala]], chosen by the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] to take part in a contest against the warlike [[Kree]] on [[Earth]]'s [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]], with the race achieving the most using Skrull technology being declared the victor, earning the chance to become the rulers of Hala and join under the [[Skrull Empire]]. The Kree, upon realizing they were going to lose, proceeded to commit a genocide of the Cotati. The Cotati however survived on Hala for many millennia by hiding themselves from the Kree, who had created their own [[Kree Empire|empire]]. They later contacted the pacifist [[Priests of Pama (Earth-616)|Priests of Pama]] who planted them throughout the universe including [[Earth]].{{r|Road to Empyre: The Kree/Skrull War Vol 1 1}}

[[Sequoia (Earth-616)|Quoi]], the prophesized [[Celestial Messiah]], learnt what had happened to his race from his father [[Swordsman (Cotati) (Earth-616)|Swordsman]].{{r|Empyre Vol 1 2}} His father hated human beings, especially since his mind clashes with the remnants of [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|the true Swordsman]]'s consciousness and was boycotted by the Cotati conclaves since he had merged with animal life, even though Quoi wasn't due to being the prophesized messiah. Swordsman went along with Quoi, who was trying to convince him about mankind's goodness, to [[Vietnam]] to merge back to his original form in the Cotati grove at a temple of the Priests of Pama. They however found the [[Alchemax (Earth-616)|Alchemax Corporation]], who were trying to harvest the Cotati grove after witnessing trees erupting out of the temple, and confronted them. Things soon heated up but Quoi stopped his father from killing the guards and gave a Cotati vine to Alchemax so they could use its miraculous properties. This however wasn't enough for them and they cut down the whole grove, killing all of the Cotati except Swordsman whose merging with his original form wasn't complete. Quoi witnessed what they had done to the Cotati and his father, which created immense hatred in his heart.{{r|Lords of Empyre: Swordsman Vol 1 1}}

Having learnt what the meat-based life had done to the Cotati, Quoi decided to take revenge on all animal life. The other Cotati, still seething in hatred over what had been done to them by the Kree, joined his cause. They started attacking the facilities of the [[Kree Imperium]] and Skrull Empire to test their new weapons which could increase a Cotati mage's control over plantlife, and also tried preventing the two from allying. As they attacked the [[Kral (Star)|Kral System]], the Skrulls detonated the [[Pyre (Item)|Pyre]] which destroyed the whole solar system but the Cotati had already fled. The empires discovered their plan and managed to convince [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Teddy Altman]] in time to become the emperor so that he could unite the two empires into the [[Kree/Skrull Alliance (Earth-616)|Alliance]].{{r|{{cl|Empyre Vol 1 2}}-[[Empyre Vol 1 3|3]]}}

===Empyre Rises===

Quoi decided to trick the Earth's heroes in order to stop the Alliance and Swordsman gave him a drink before the coming war in order tp purge all doubt from his mind. Quoi's mother [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]] appeared in form of a plant before his son after he drank and tried convincing his father had gone mad. She showed him the memories of the real [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]] she loved and  saved from being a broken wreck, how his father who was an Elder Cotati struggled with his new form that had Swordsman's memories, how Quoi himself struggled to adapt to the human world but gained friends. Quoi however refused to accept what she said and probing her memory, found she has given in to [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]]'s suggestion for psychologically influencing people. Grabbing her, he reminded her how he and her father had to suffer from trying to be men of two worlds, before destroying her plant body and severing the psychic link.{{r|Lords of Empyre: Celestial Messiah Vol 1 1}}

The Cotati had also received mysterious weapons, created by the ancient "First Race", which were far more advanced than those of the Kree/Skrull Alliance and powered by mysterious crystalline batteries.{{r|Empyre: Fallout Fantastic Four Vol 1 1}} The Alliance having discovered their true plans, decided to attack them on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]]. The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] proceeded to battle the invaders, believing they had come to wipe the Cotati out. After [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] disabled all of the Alliance ships, the Cotati revealed the truth that they were creating a Death Blossom which amplified Quoi's control over all flora. He started killing all those on the ships and revealed that the Cotati planned to create their own empyrean over the whole universe, which he dubbed the "Empyre".{{r|Empyre Vol 1 1}} Unknown to the Earth heroes, they had also killed [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] and [[Hulk (Cotati) (Earth-616)|infested]] her body with a Cotati, to use her as a sleeper agent.{{r|Immortal She-Hulk Vol 1 1}}

Sequoia offered to let the Avengers live if they stood aside, but was refused and fled before [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], who freed himself along with his comrades, could attack him. Meanwhile, nearly everyone on the Alliance ships was killed, except those on the flagship due to [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] working with Teddy and absorbing his [[Excelsior (Star-Sword)|Excelsior]]'s power, severing the Cotati's link with plant life there with the resulting burst of energy. The Avengers, Alliance, and Fantastic Four afterwards decided to ally in order to beat back the Cotati who had started attacking Earth.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 2}} A Cotati spaceship later attacked a lone surviving Alliance ship, but was destroyed by the new [[Accuser Corps (Earth-616)|Accuser]] Marvel, who unwittingly killed all the Cotati onboard as [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan]]'s [[Universal Weapon]] proved too powerful.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 18}}

===War Against Earth===
The surviving Alliance soldiers later battled the Cotati on Earth, winning a battle in a [[Mexico|Mexican]] village near [[Navojoa]] with the help of [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] and [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]]. The two heroes along with [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] tried to stop the Alliance soldiers when they started executing the Cotati captives, but were overpowered or made to surrender. The densely forested regions around the globe were however devastated, while [[Wakanda]] was able to avoid Cotati scouting parties due to its force-field. [[Shanna O'Hara (Earth-616)|Shanna Plunder]] unsuccessfully fought the Cotati with her son [[Matthew Plunder (Earth-616)|Matthew]] in the [[Savage Land]], but was defeated. [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]] went along with [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]], [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Doctor Voodoo]], and [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] after learning of the invasion there and were attacked by a group of Cotati. They held them off, but were soon defeated by [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]] and Shanna, who were under Cotati control due to their bond with nature.{{r|{{cl|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 1}}-[[Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 2|2]]}}

On the Blue Area of the Moon, the Cotati readied the sunward node to launch on Earth's nations. They were discovered by [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]] who went investigating after seeing plants growing on the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]]'s surface near the [[Summer House]], and tried dissuading them from attacking the planet. The Cotati instead attacked and subdued him, before proceeding to interrogate his mind. This triggered Vulcan's memories of him being altered by a trio of aliens and caused him to start raging, resulting in the death of every Cotati in sight as his powers caused a massive explosion.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 10}} The Cotati in retaliation launched an invasion of [[Krakoa]] itself, but all of the invaders were soon slaughtered by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], who also discovered the Cotati were attacking globally. He later joined in the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]'s counterattack on the Blue Area of the Moon.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 11}}

As a tree-like Cotati warship touched down in [[Mexico City]], they started attacking it to use the humans as fertilizer and unleashed a giant flower on it. [[Conan (Earth-616)|Conan]], who was stranded in the modern era slayed many of them, but was knocked out by a poisoned arrow. [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]] brought him back to his senses and together they fought the invaders. Conan attacked with Cotati warriors by running them beneath a combine harvester on Eddie's advice, allowing him to smash a fuel tanker into the flower, which resulted in its death as it exploded.{{r|Empyre: Savage Avengers Vol 1 1}} The powerful Cotati mage [[Shi Qaanth (Earth-616)|Shi Qaanth]] meanwhile attacked [[Fort Myer]] in [[Arlington County]] with his soldiers, so they could easily take [[Washington, D.C.]], but they were forced to flee after [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] intervened and helped in turning the tide. Shi Qaanth lost his eye after being shot by an American soldier named Bennett, but secretly infected him before leaving. After Captain America met [[James Woodley (Earth-616)|General Woodley]], Shi Qaanth utilized Bennet to infect the general as well, while himself preparing to attack Mexico City.{{r|Empyre: Captain America Vol 1 1}}

The Cotati also set up a base in the desolate [[Genosha]] as part of their plot to invade Wakanda. Their plans however were interrupted when they were attacked by Genosha's mutant inhabitants, accidentally revived by [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] as [[zombies]]. [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]]'s group discovered this when they came to check up on the Genoshan gate, and encountered a group of Cotati fleeing from the zombies before destroying them both. The activities of the Cotati also attracted the attention of the [[Hordeculture (Earth-616)|Hordeculture]], who wanted to take their samples.{{r|{{cl|Empyre: X-Men Vol 1 1}}-[[Empyre: X-Men Vol 1 2|2]]}} The Cotati soon turned the tide everywhere in their favor and assaulted Wakanda in order to utilize its vibranium-rich soil for a more powerful Death Blossom. Mantis meanwhile arrived at Wakanda after having messaged [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] to convince her son to abandon the war, but he requested Teddy to allow him to use Excelsior for his war just in case, forcing the Alliance to abandon their plans to attack the Blue Area of the Moon by stabbing Marvel again.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 3}}

[[Lauri-Ell (Earth-616)|Lauri-Ell]], Captain Marvel and [[Chewie (Earth-58163)|Chewie]] beat back a Cotati invasion in a park in [[East Village]] area of [[Manhattan]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 19}} Marvel was later called by Lauri-Ell to the [[Brooklyn]] Botanic Garden where she discovered the Cotati had taken abducted humans to. Marvel along with [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat]], [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]] and [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] came to her rescue. The four fought the Cotati with the pieces of the Universal Weapon [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] had split for them, however the spell soon started disintegrating and disorienting the heroes. As the Cotati surrounded Marvel, Lauri-Ell picked up the Universal Weapon she had dropped and merged all the pieces back. The weapon transformed her into a true Accuser and she used it to turn the tide against the Cotati. The four heroes then destroyed the building along with the Cotati nest, upon clearing it of civilians.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 21}}

Meanwhile in [[Central Park]], [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] while investigating the mysterious plant growth came upon [[Samuel Smithers (Earth-616)|Plantman]]{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 1}} and was attacked. [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] and [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Doctor Nemesis]] fought against him and found that he was helping the Cotati after having been empowered by them. Meanwhile in the Savage Land, Ka-Zar freed Shanna from the Cotati control while the other heroes fought the Cotati alongside Matthew Plunder. Ka-Zar was however stabbed in the ensuing fight.{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 2}} The Cotati in Genosha after realizing they couldn't win, decided to initiate the creation of the giant seed pod, trapping two of the Hordeculture members, [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]] and [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet St. Croix]]. [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] struck the pod in an attempt to free her them, it only made it bigger and caused it to partially burst. She then called upon the aid of other psychic mutants of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] to fight the zombie mutants and the Cotati.{{r|{{cl|Empyre: X-Men Vol 1 2}}-[[Empyre: X-Men Vol 1 3|3]]}}

The Cotati in Wakanda breached its defenses, but were unable to best its defenders. Mantis along with [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]], She-Hulk and [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|The Thing]] arrived at [[Lake Victoria]] to convince her son to give up his war, but he rejected that animals were capable of peace, reminding her how the Skrulls had detonated the Pyre in the Kral system. She-Hulk then warned Quoi that the Alliance were going to deploy the Pyre in [[Sol|Earth's solar system]] and he should hasten their victory, before attacking the Terrans with a Gamma Blast. The Cotati implant inside her revealed she was already dead and had been corrupted during her time on the Moon.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 4}}

Captain America and the American soldiers fought the Cotati in [[San Antonio]], before the arrival of Alliance soldiers who killed their enemies but also caused a lot of human deaths. Despite flaring tempers, they didn't come to blows and told them about Shi Qaanth massing an army for attack on Mexico City, including a giant creature called "[[Man of Earth (Earth-616)|Man of Earth]]" made of plant and stone, in order to create a seismic event that would wipe out all life on Earth. While they were resting, they discovered Bennet's infection and beat all those who were infected by the Cotati spores. Captain America realized that General Woodley must be infected too and hurried to Brussels to stop the Cotati from killing the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Earth-616)|NATO]] representatives. They succeeded by destroying his body, which had turned into plant-like because of Cotati spores and Captain America convinced NATO members to mount a joint defense of Mexico City.{{r|Empyre: Captain America Vol 1 2}}

The Cotati who had been zombified meanwhile granted the others access into the pod's insides so they could eat the womb with the gestating [[Cotatinaught]], a doomsday being created from the strength-sap of the Cotati. Magik took Hordeculture's [[Opal Vetiver (Earth-616)|Opal Vetiver]] to [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] so they could develop a bio-weapon that could be used to kill the Cotati. Meanwhile, the mutant [[Explodey Boy (Earth-616)|Explodey Boy]] made a deal to protect Multiple Man's group by blowing up the Empyrean soldiers, in exchange for letting him feast on the body parts of his duplicates. After Beast and Opal finished developing the bio-weapon, which [[Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616)|Black Tom]] took to Genosha and the X-Men used to destroy the Cotati. The Cotainaught however was infected by the zombies as the ate its pod.{{r|Empyre: X-Men Vol 1 3}} It was however destroyed soon after its birth by Explodey Boy, and the zombies dissipated due to the spell [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] had cast a month earlier.{{r|Empyre: X-Men Vol 1 4}}

In Wakanda, the Cotati overwhelmed its defenders near the [[Mena Ngai|Great Vibranium Mound]], while their forces elsewhere kept Earth's heroes and forces busy. As the [[Wakandan Air Guard (Earth-616)|Wakandan Air Guard]] fired in the direction of Black Panther to take down the Cotati surrounding him, one of the Cotati mages sacrificed himself to open a portal for Quoi and the Swordsman. The Swordsman caught Black Panther off-guard and utilized it to stab him with a sword. Presuming him dead, Quoi proceeded to plant the Death Blossom in the Vibranium Mound. Unknown to them, the former Skrull empress [[R'Klll (Earth-616)|R'Klll]] had already launched the Pyre into the Sun.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 5}} In Central Park, Plantman used his new-found powers to create the [[Sprout Soldiers (Earth-616)|Sprout Soldiers]] and trapped Luke Cage, who was freed by Vision. Luke and Doctor Nemesis destroyed all the Sprout Soldiers, before Vision heated up the water in the park so Plantman couldn't grow new ones.{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 3}}

In the Savage Land, Shanna destroyed the Cotati protecting the mage [[Veltri (Earth-616)|Veltri]] who had been controlling her and Man-Thing, presuming they had killed Ka-Zar. Scarlet Witch however stated they could revive him since his soul was trapped in the [[Ebony Blade]] he was stabbed with, and called on Doctor Voodoo to help her. Having broken the Cotai control over Man-Thing, he agreed while the others held the Cotati off. Ka-Zar's soul was successfully put back in his body after it was healed by the land's waters and the Savage Land recognized the Cotati as a threat, since they tried taking its spirit. As the Cotati found themselves surrounded by [[Dinosaurs|dinosaurs]], they were forced to surrender and imprisoned.{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 3}}

Meanwhile, Shi Qaanth mounted his assault on Mexico City. The NATO forces fought the Cotati on ground, while most of the Alliance soldiers held back until the Man of Earth was taken down. Captain America told the defenders to destroy the cars around their location to slow the Cotati, while unknown to him the Alliance commanders were planning to level the city after killing the Man of Earth. As they fired their missiles at him, the Man of Earth smashed their flagship in anger to the ground, ripping open the fault line. Captain America after discovering Shi Qaanth was riding atop him, used an Alliance glider to get to the Cotati mage and destroyed his sceptre he was using to manipulate plant life. This caused the Man of Earth to be destroyed and most of the Cotati were teleported away, while Shi Qaanth apparently fell to his death.{{r|Empyre: Captain America Vol 1 3}}

In [[New York City]], the [[Dark Harvest (Earth-616)|Dark Harvest]], an elite squad of the Priests of Pama, abducted the genetically-engineered Kree child [[Jo-Venn (Earth-616)|Jo-Venn]], as he was imbued with the memories of the [[Kree-Skrull War]]. Probing his mind, they learnt how to build the [[Omni-Wave Projector]] and used it to broadcast his memories of the conflict, causing the Alliance soldiers to start fighting each other. [[N'Kalla (Earth-616)|N'Kalla]], whom they had been unsuccessful in kidnapping earlier and was also filled with memories of the war, tried to rescue him but was defeated and used to create hate among the Alliance soldiers. The [[New Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] replacements on Earth - [[Valeria Richards (Earth-616)|Brainstorm]], [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Powerhouse]], [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]; however tracked her down and fought the Dark Harvest. Brainstorm and Powerhouse told Jo-Venn and N'Kalla to remember being made to constantly fight each other, but being the only ones who had anything in common and fighting together to win their freedom. Their thoughts caused the Alliance soldiers to fight in greater unison than before.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 22|23}}

Meanwhile, Captain Glory revealed the fake Teddy to be R'Klll out of guilt, with the real one retaking his throne and ordering the Alliance to assist Earth's heroes. Mantis used her powers to prevent Susan from feeling pain or exhaustion, allowing Susan to grab her. As the real She-Hulk came back to life with the help of the [[Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)|Leader]], Grimm told her that he believed in her since they would always be family. This caused She-Hulk to burn the Cotati out of her system and regain control of her body. [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] using a special suit built by Iron Man blocked Quoi's control over plants, as the combined Alliance-Earth forces stopped the Pyre from blowing up the Sun and attacked the Cotati in Wakanda. Thor, who had gained [[Gaea (Earth-616)|Gaea]]'s powers, nullified their control over plants, while Black Panther revealed he only pretended to die and fought the Swordsman, stabbing him and the Death Blossom with the Excelsior. This caused the Death Blossom to be destroyed and the Cotati surrendered, with the X-Men having destroyed their base on the Moon as well.{{r|Immortal She-Hulk Vol 1 1}}{{r|Empyre Vol 1 6}}

===Exiled===

Quoi and the surviving Cotati were later taken to a barren planet by Thor to an uncharted section in space under the watch of Powerhouse and Susan Storm. Thor covered the entire planet in plant-life so the Cotati could live there. Because the Cotati's new planet was in uncharted space and they no longer had access to starships, they could live out there in peace without posing a threat to anyone else.{{r|Empyre: Fallout Fantastic Four Vol 1 1}}
