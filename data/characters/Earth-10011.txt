| Overview                = The Cancerverse is a reality where life finally defeated [[Death (Earth-10011)|Death]]. With eternal life being fueled by the [[Many-Angled Ones]], every living being in this universe was corrupted and turned to their servitude, resulting in a universe-wide living corpse.

| History                 = 
===Early years===
The [[Great Old Ones|Many-Angled Ones]] had already begun to extend their influence at a significant extent (comparatively to [[Reality-616]]).{{r|Thanos Imperative #3}}

Apart from that fact, Reality-10011 was seemingly similar to [[Reality-616]], until its corruption of her reality by the [[Great Old Ones|Many-Angled Ones]], including seemingly identical heroes and teams, the [[Kree]], the birth of [[Franklin Richards (Earth-10011)|Franklin Richards]], [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-10011)|Crystal]] and the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-10011)|Human Torch]] dating,{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Fantastic Four #1}} and eventually, the turning point of that reality, [[Mar-Vell (Earth-10011)|Mar-Vell]] dying from cancer.{{r|Thanos Imperative #3}}

===Mar-Vell's Corruption===
Before the {{cl|Death of Captain Marvel Vol 1 1|death of Captain Marvel}}, with no cure (scientific or magical) to save him, his terminal condition caused such distress among the people who adored him,{{r|Thanos Imperative #3}} all across the universe,{{r|Avengers NOW! #1|; Cancerverse's profile}} and the empathic trauma was sensed by the Many-Angled Ones. They reached to the dying Mar-Vell to give him one simple truth: ''"[[Necronomicon|Even]] '''[[Death (Earth-10011)|Death]]''' [[Necronomicon|may die]]."''{{r|Thanos Imperative #3}} While [[Revengers (Earth-10011)|Avengers]], [[Defenders of the Realm (Earth-10011)|Defenders]], [[X-Men (Earth-10011)|X-Men]], [[Ftaghn Four (Earth-10011)|Fantastic Four]], and other heroes were present for a vigil at his deathbed at that point.{{r|Avengers NOW! #1|; Cancerverse's profile}}

Mar-Vell transmuted his closest allies, among them the [[Revengers (Earth-10011)|Avengers (now the Revengers)]], the [[Defenders of the Realm (Earth-10011)|Defenders (or Defenders of the Realm)]],{{r|Avengers NOW! #1|; Cancerverse's profile}} the [[X-Men (Earth-10011)|X-Men (or Ex-Men]]),{{r|Realm of Kings: Imperial Guard #4}} the [[Ftaghn Four (Earth-10011)|Fantastic Four (now the Ftaghn Four]]).{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Fantastic Four #1}}<!-- 
* not corrupted: Machine Resistance + Scarlet Witch (spy, under a he) -->

Despite the opposition of many, including seemingly at least members of the [[Machine Resistance (Earth-10011)|Machine Resistance]], the corrupted heroes performed a ritual know as the [[Necropsy]], sacrificing the [[Avatar of Death]]{{r|Thanos Imperative #3}} on the spacecraft [[Sanctuary (Vehicle)|Sanctuary]],{{r|Avengers NOW! #1|; Cancerverse's profile}} and consequently annihilating [[Death (Earth-10011)|Death]] itself, and allowing the Many-Angled ones to fully enter this universe.{{r|Thanos Imperative #3}}

[[Earth]]'s heroes, now zealous worshipers and servants of the Many-Angled Ones and [[Outer Gods]], were transformed and enhanced by the gifts of their masters,{{r|Realm of Kings #1}} who turned them [[Demons|demonic]] upon infusion their ancient power.{{r|Avengers NOW! #1|; Cancerverse's profile}} Due to its great powers, [[Franklin Richards (Earth-10011)|Franklin Richards]] became the host of many of the Elder Gods<!-- GOO/MAO -->.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Fantastic Four #1}}

At an undefined point in their conquest, the Many-Angled Ones also corrupted the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] (at least [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-10011)|Crystal]]),{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Fantastic Four #1}} and the [[Kree]], including [[Ronan (Earth-10011)|Ronan]] who joined the Revengers.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Silver Surfer #1}}

Filling the universe with their corruption, making of it a bloated and deathless corpse, the forces of the Many-Angled Ones decapitated [[Galan (Earth-10011)|Galactus]] and weaponized his head into the "Galactus Engine".{{r|Avengers NOW! #1|; Cancerverse's profile}}

===The Fault===
<!-- Quasar.{{r|Realm of Kings #1}} -->Following the launching of the [[Terrigen Bomb|T-Bomb]] by the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] of [[Earth-616]] and its subsequent detonation during a battle between that universe's [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] and [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]], a breach (known as the [[Fault]]) was formed, creating a bridge to this corrupted universe. Several expeditions by entities of Earth-616 led to numerous encounters with the entities of the Cancerverse, including the Revengers and the Ex-Men.{{citation}}

Upon discovering the vast room to expand in that universe, the forces of the Cancerverse launched a campaign to invade Earth-616 and rid it of its concept of [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]]. Led by [[Mar-Vell (Earth-10011)|Lord Mar-Vell]], the Cancerverse forces struck against the combined might of the [[Shi'ar Empire|Shi'ar]], the [[Kree Empire|Kree]], the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]], and an assorted group of [[Glossary:Cosmic Beings|cosmic beings]] (including [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]], [[Aegis (Proemial God) (Earth-616)|Aegis]], and [[Tenebrous (Earth-616)|Tenebrous]]); captured the anomalous [[Namorita Prentiss (Earth-TRN343)|Namorita]], who had been saved by [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] during his brief encounter with the [[Sphinx]]; and looked for [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]], the avatar of Death, so they could perform a ritual to destroy the [[Abstract Entities|abstract being]]. Meanwhile, the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] invaded the Cancerverse alongside Thanos, fighting against numerous protectors of the Cancerverse, such as the [[Defenders (Earth-10011)|Defenders]], and briefly allying themselves with the last vestiges of good in this universe: the [[Machine Resistance (Earth-10011)|Machine Resistance]], led by the [[Vision (Earth-10011)|Vision]].{{citation}}

Discovering the avatar of Death to be in his home reality, Mar-Vell returned alongside the Revengers for a final confrontation with the Guardians and Thanos. After a short fight, Thanos submitted to Mar-Vell, begging to be killed by him. Mar-Vell then performed the ritual to destroy Death on Thanos but ended up inadvertently summoning Death herself into the Cancerverse. Death then proceeded to kill many of the Cancerverse inhabitants and cripple their masters for aeons.{{r|Thanos Imperative #6}}

However, due to Earth-616's Death not applying to this universe, the Cancerverse could not be destroyed. Consequently, the Revengers were brought back to life and tried to use a [[Cosmic Cube]] in possession of [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]], who stayed in the Cancerverse with [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova (Rich Rider)]] and [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax the Destroyer]] to prevent Thanos from returning to their universe, to invade Earth-616 again, but Thanos was able to seize it from them.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 19|20}} Rider was able to take the Cosmic Cube back and used it to become a portal and send Drax, Star-Lord, and Thanos back home, while entrapping himself in the Cancerverse.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 20}}

===Takeover by Worldmind===
Alone, Richards was killed over and over by the Cancerverse's forces, until he sacrificed the entire [[Glossary:Nova Force|Nova Force]] and the [[Xandarian Worldmind (Earth-616)|Xandarian Worldmind]] to power the Cosmic Cube and return home. Abandoned, the Xandarian Worldmind adapted to its surroundings by becoming one with it.{{r|Nova Vol 7 6}}<!--

===Entrapment===
[[Joseph Ledger (Earth-TRN852)|Joseph Ledger]] of [[Earth-TRN852]] traveled to Reality-10011 and ended up in the Necro-System.  After learning of the Many-Angled Ones, he absorbed the entire reality into his [[Power Prism]]. When it suited him, he could unleash aspects of the reality from the prism, such as when he fired weaponized cancer at [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-TRN852)|Star Brand]].{{r|Heroes Reborn Vol 2 4}}
