Years after, Tiger and his colleague [[Geyr Kluge (Earth-616)|Key]], recruited [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]] to lead a new incarnation of Euroforce, and Tiger became a member of the newly revamped team.{{r|Avengers World #12}}

In one of their first missions, they were dispatched to [[Italy]] to investigate the magical disturbances that were being created there. Along the way, Tiger and his teammates came across some members of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and originally thought they were beyond what was going on until the Black Knight stepped in to intervene. Soon after, they were attacked by the sorceress [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]] and her army of the dead.{{r|Avengers World #8}}

Some time later, Black Knight left to [[Weirdworld (Battleworld)|Weirdworld]] and Key returned to the team and was appointed new leader.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #18}}
