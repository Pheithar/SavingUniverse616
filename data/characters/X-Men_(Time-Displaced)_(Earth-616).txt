Beast planned young [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] to meet his older self and make him realize what he had become after killing their mentor, [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]]. However, as soon as they arrived in the present, Beast got worse and had to be taken for treatment.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 1|2}} While he recovered, the time-displaced X-Men confronted Cyclops to no avail, as he ended up fleeing.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 3|4}} The young Beast later helped his future counterpart survive his new mutation.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 5}}

[[File:X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616) from X-Men Battle of the Atom Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|Led by Kitty Pryde]]
Under the leadership of [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]], the team decided to stay and resolve the problems of this time before returning to their own, despite the protests of the young [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]].{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 6}} After being lied to, having his mind partially wiped by Jean, and not being allowed to make decisions of his own, Angel had enough and joined the present day Cyclops' [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 11}}

[[File:All-New X-Men Vol 1 18 Immonen Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|New uniforms]]
===Time at the New Charles Xavier School===
When Kitty decided to quit [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|school]] for not trusting his X-Men faction anymore, due to their actions during their battle against the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-13729)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] from [[Earth-13729|the future]], the time-displaced X-Men decided to go with her to Cyclops' [[Weapon X Facility|school]].{{r|X-Men: Battle of the Atom Vol 1 2}} The team subsequently rescued [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] from a group of [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] that were attempting to capture her after her escape from [[Murderworld]],{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 19}} prompting the team to take Laura in as a new member after the Purifiers had been defeated.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 21}}

Later, the past X-Men had to join forces with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] and the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]] to rescue [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] from the [[Shi'ar Empire]], which wanted her to pay for the crimes her future self committed as the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]]'s host. During this encounter, Jean manifested a new power, which combined her telepathy and telekinesis in ways she had never seen before, and Cyclops learned that [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|his father]] was alive, prompting him to join the Starjammers.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 13}}

Following a rematch with the future Brotherhood,{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 26|29}} the team was accidentally transferred into [[Earth-1610|another universe]] by [[Carmen Cruise (Earth-616)|a new mutant]]'s erratic powers,{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 32}} culminating in a team-up with that world's [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Spider-Man]] and [[X-Men (Earth-1610)|X-Men]] to save Beast from [[Victor van Damme (Earth-1610)|Doctor Doom]]. They later retrieved the mutant and returned to their world.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 36}} Cyclops rejoined the X-Men's ranks when they returned to [[Earth]] after investigating the [[Black Vortex]] alongside the Guardians.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 40}}

===Road Trip===
[[File:All-New X-Men Vol 2 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]
Following the rise of anti-mutant hysteria and the beginning of the [[M-Pox]] crisis, the young X-Men decided to go separate ways and lay low for a while. Beast eventually reunited the team (with the exception of Jean Grey) and, joined by [[Evan Sabahnur (Earth-616)|Evan Sabahnur]] and [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie Okonkwo]], decided to go on a road trip across the [[United States of America|United States]], assisting crisis all over the world whenever it was needed, with the help of a teleporting [[Bamf]] named [[Pickles (Earth-616)|Pickles]].{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 1}}

Frustrated by his inability to find a way to return home with his friends, Beast decided to experiment with magic.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 8|9}} These experiments eventually led him to find a way to travel through time using the [[Third Eye of Horus]], a gift from [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]]. However, after seeing what he thought to be the original X-Men acting in the past, Hank deduced that wasn't their timeline of origin and reunited his teammates to show them his unfortunate discovery. The young X-Men then went back to the present and proceeded to look forward to their future, which would no longer be tied to their concurrent older selves.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 19}}

===Disciples of Magneto===
Faced with their new freedom from the "need" to return to the past, the X-Men were soon contacted by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], who wanted to use Xavier's original students to set an example for the world since he couldn't operate in the open due to his reputation. Even though the X-Men remained cautious of Magneto's ulterior motives, they agreed to work under his coordination, and moved their base of operations to an [[X-Mansion (Madripoor)|X-Mansion]] in [[Madripoor]].{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 1}} In secret, Magneto worked on a time platform with the intention to help the X-Men return to their original time.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 2}}

[[File:X-Men Blue Vol 1 23 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|New members Bloodstorm and Jimmy Hudson]]
====Cross Time Capers====
After a handful of adventures during which they recruited two stranded travelers from other realities, [[James Hudson Jr. (Earth-1610)|Jimmy Hudson]] and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-21710)|Bloodstorm]], the young X-Men saw themselves directed by Magneto to use his time platform to travel through time after the [[Glossary:Timestream|timestream]] suddenly began collapsing.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 16}} The time platform took the X-Men through different time periods of [[Earth-TRN657|an altered timeline in which the original five X-Men seemingly took over the world]], prompting them to make new allies along the way.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 17|18}}

Upon reaching their original era,{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 18}} the X-Men discovered the group of X-Men they had seen when they checked up on their past earlier were actually impersonators: the returned [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-TRN879)|Future Brotherhood]], who had hopped back in time to fill the void left by the young X-Men and in the process held [[Charles Xavier (Earth-TRN657)|Professor X]] captive.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 19}} After defeating the Brotherhood with their newfound allies and forcing them to retreat, the young X-Men learned the Professor X from their time had managed to send a psychic suggestion through time to Magneto in the present, hence the reason why Magneto instructed them to use his time platform. Despite their desire to stay in the past, the young X-Men returned to the present, since they would need to return to the exact moment they had left in order to fully repair the damage caused by the Brotherhood to the timeline.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 20}}

====Poison Invasion & Mothervine Crisis====
Following the capture of Corsair at the hands of the space pirate [[Killer Thrill (Earth-616)|Killer Thrill]], Cyclops rallied most of his teammates to rescue him. Since Killer Thrill was in possession of a [[Symbiotes (Race)|symbiote]], they first sought [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]]'s help.{{r|X-Men: Blue Annual Vol 1 1}} During their pursuit, the X-Men temporarily bonded to symbiotes themselves. Unfortunately they stumbled upon the predatory [[Poisons]], and Jean was seemingly assimilated by their [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)|Hive]]. After rescuing Corsair, Venom and the X-Men rushed back to Earth to warn about the Poisons' intention to invade the planet.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 21|22}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 162|163}}

[[File:X-Men Blue Vol 1 25 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|The patchwork line-up]]
During the X-Men's space adventure, an alliance formed by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], [[Claudine Renko (Earth-616)|Miss Sinister]], and [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]] mobilized to release the [[Mothervine]] virus, a catalyst for artificial mutations as well as secondary and tertiary mutations, across the world.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 23}} Due to the absence of most of the young X-Men, Magneto's allies banded together to fill their void, including [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] and [[Shen Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]].{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 25}} The patchwork auxiliary line-up confronted Havok's cabal with Emma Frost's help, who turned against her allies, while Magneto neutralized Mothervine with [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]]'s help.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 28}}

Venom and the X-Men returned to Earth right after the Hive had arrived. As part of their invasion plan, the Hive started infecting many superhumans with symbiotes in order to assimilate them afterwards.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 1}} One of the heroes assimilated by the Poisons was Jimmy Hudson.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 4}} When the heroes confronted the Poison Queen, Jean resurfaced since her psyche had survived the assimilation due to her powers. She killed the Poison Queen, causing a chain reaction that killed most of her subjects. One of the surviving Poisons was Jimmy,{{r|Venomized Vol 1 5}} whose original psyche survived the assimilation process, and struggled against the Poison's consciousness. The young X-Men tracked down Jimmy and tried to bring him back, but eventually left him alone so that he could figure out his duality between mutant and alien.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 29|30}}

[[File:X-Men Blue Vol 1 32 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Fall out with the Master of Magnetism]]
The young X-Men quickly found out that Magneto had been pushed to his limits during the Mothervine crisis, and he vowed to once again advance his mutant agenda by any means necessary.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 30}} Erik additionally blamed his former pupils for abandoning him in a moment of need, arguing they shouldn't have gone away since he had warned them their enemies were close to striking. The X-Men intercepted Magneto in [[Paris (France)|Paris]] and stopped him from killing Emma Frost, he only backed down because he knew the X-Men wouldn't give up either, and refused to risk their lives.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 32}}

===Extermination===
Eventually, the displaced team was faced with the potential dark consequences of their time in the present when the mutant-hunter [[Roderick Campbell (Earth-811)|Ahab]] attacked, using various brainwashed mutants as his [[Hounds (Earth-811)|Hounds]] with the aid of a pair of telepathic mutant twins, [[Maxime (Mutant) (Earth-TRN727)|Maxime]] and [[Manon (Mutant) (Earth-TRN727)|Manon]], who hailed from [[Earth-TRN727|a dark future]] that began when [[Robert Drake (Earth-TRN727)|one]] of [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-TRN727)|the original five]] was killed. The other X-Men initially tried to protect the five, but were caught off-guard by the actions of [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|a younger version]] of [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], who killed his own future self in the belief that he had forgotten his purpose and went so far as to amputate [[Calvin Rankin (Earth-616)|Mimic]]'s Angel-copied wings so that he could transplant them on to the time-displaced Angel to restore his appearance.<!-- {{r|Extermination Vol 1 1|5}} -->

After a close call where Mimic sacrificed himself to save Cyclops from Ahab's attack, the original five accepted the need to return to their time, but first made a detour to the point when Ahab's psychic twins were training at the school before Ahab captured them. The twins were thus able to not only teach Jean how to undo the brainwashing they would inflict on Ahab's Hounds, but also taught Jean how she could put a "timer" on any memories she suppressed. As a result, once the team returned to the past just after Beast had departed with their past selves, Jean was able to wipe the memories of their time in the future, timing them to reappear in their present selves just after the younger team departed, thus restoring Jean's memories of how to undo the twins' brainwashing on the Hounds.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 1|5}}
