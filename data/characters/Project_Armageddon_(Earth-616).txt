| History                 = Project Armageddon was a clandestine super-solder program and top secret genetics experiment that was dedicated to artificially inseminating female subjects to produce a mutant offspring that the United States government could research and develop as a genetic weapon. By experimenting on the subject known as Beatrice, the program yielded multiple subjects, notably [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]], but all proved to be failures until program yielded a successful subject in the form of [[Lazarus (Domino's Brother) (Earth-616)|Lazarus]].{{r|Domino Vol 2 4}}
