| History                 = ===Origin===
Black Ant was a [[Life-Model Decoy]] of [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Eric O'Grady]], the third [[Ant-Man]], who was killed in battle against the [[Descendants (Earth-616)|Descendants]].{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 23}} He was sent to join the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] on behalf of the Descendants, as a double agent.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 24}} Despite his programming, the Black Ant still fought as Ant-Man, with no obvious differences.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 25}}

During a fight against the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]], because he was a robot, he was not affected by the control by the [[Serpent Crown]].{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 30}} As one of the two Avengers free from [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]]'s influence, he and [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Venom]] battled the criminals and freed their teammates.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 31}}

[[File:Eric O'Grady (LMD) (Earth-616) from Secret Avengers Vol 1 24.jpg|thumb|left|As Ant-Man]]
===Reveal===
Black Ant's heroic rescue of the team was short-lived as [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] was quick to deduce that Black Ant was, in fact, now a robot working for the Descendants. Since Ant-Man had just saved the team, [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and the rest of the Avengers refused to believe her accusation, so she quit the team in protest.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 32}}

The LMD however changed his identity to Black Ant and began an attack on the [[Lighthouse]]. His teammates Venom and [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] were left to die, whilst [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]] and the original [[Human Torch (Android) (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] were kidnapped.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 33}} Venom woke up and helped Valkyrie and, after they recovered, he swore revenge on the robot and took up the task to personally take him down.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 34}} In the Core, Venom, Valkyrie and Black Widow were breaking into Father's base, hoping to find something they could use. However, the only member of Father's army they encountered was a hidden Black Ant, who contacted the others.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 35}}

The team broke into the nursery of Parvez, who was kidnapped from the heroes by a Descendant strikeforce. As they prepared to escape with him, the group was ambushed by the Black Ant. Black Ant explained that he remembered every part of Ant-Man's life, and that if he did not do as father said, Father would have killed him. Black Ant's justifications caused Venom to go berserk, and a fight begun.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 36}} Valkyrie rescued Venom from Black Ant's blast by stabbing the robot with her sword, as the Orb of Necromancy the Father used to empower him and the Descendants gave him soul, he died like a human being, before shrinking while swearing he would see Valkyrie and Venom in the afterlife soon.{{r|Secret Avengers #37}}

===Illuminati===
The [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]] got his hands on Black Ant's corpse and rebuilt him.{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 2}} Both Black Ant and Mad Thinker later joined the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]]'s [[Illuminati (Hood's) (Earth-616)|Illuminati]].{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 1}} Eric joined under the Hood's promise to give him a "new flesh-and-blood" body.{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 2}} However, the [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]] betrayed the team and destroyed Black Ant with a bomb he placed inside him.{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 4}}

===Secret Empire===
Black Ant resurfaced not long afterwards in Bagalia.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 11}} Around this time, Captain America had been secretly supplanted by an [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|evil version]] of himself from an [[Earth-61311|alternate timeline]]. He was involved in an operation in Bagalia,{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 1}} and Bagalia's sheriff Taskmaster managed to obtain a recording of him showing his loyalty for Hydra. Taskmaster and Black Ant attempted to sell the recording to [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]]. However, [[Elisa Sinclair (Earth-61311)|Elisa Sinclair]], an ally of the evil Captain America, intercepted them{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 12}} and forced them to become her new bodyguards.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 14}}

By the time Hydra rose to power and conquered the United States, the duo had become members of [[Avengers (Hydra) (Earth-616)|Hydra's own Avengers]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} Both Black Ant and Taskmaster decided to switch allegiances during the final battle between Hydra and the resistance as soon as Hydra started losing. They freed some of Hydra's prisoners, namely the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]], in hopes that the young heroes would later put in a good word for them.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 8}}

===Kraven's Great Hunt===
[[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven]] hired Black Ant and Taskmaster to capture all animal-inspired criminals to be imprisoned in [[Central Park]] for him, to fight against poachers, so that everyone he thought acted dishonorably would annihilate each other.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 20}} Unfortunately for Black Ant, he also acted dishonorably, so Kraven bribed Taskmaster to betray Eric and imprison him with the others.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 18}}

Eventually the force field surrounding Central Park was torn down, and the prisoners fled. However, a group of criminals captured Black Ant and decided to kill him to punish him for what he had done.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 23}} Luckily Taskmaster regretted betraying Eric and went back to save him, reconciling their friendship.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 23}}
