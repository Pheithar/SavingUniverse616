| History                 = Galactus' 'Cat' (a name given to it by the heroes involved in the so-called [[Marvel Super Heroes: Secret Wars|Secret Wars]]) was a robot utilized and presumably created by the world-devourer [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]]. 

When Galactus was transported to the patchwork planet called [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]] by the alien being called the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] along with a group of other villains and heroes to fight, Galactus deigned to take part in the hostilities. He called his ship to him, which contained the 'Cat.' When the collection of heroes took shelter in an alien village at the foot of the mountain Galactus had stood upon, Galactus sent the robot 'Cat' to deal with them. The robot initially had the upper hand over the heroes, but [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] lodged his shield in one of its eyes to distract it, before the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] grabbed it in a wrestling hold. Thing's teammate the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] blasted the cat in the mouth with the full heat of his flame powers. The robot couldn't stand up to the heat, and exploded from within.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 5}}
