===Coulson's Team===
Melinda May was one of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s best agents. She joined [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-616)|Phil Coulson]]'s team to investigate how the terrorist, [[Abu Mussan (Earth-616)|Abu Mussan]] got hold of an [[Hofund|Uru sword]]. Along with [[Jemma Simmons (Earth-616)|Jemma Simmons]], May helped [[Heimdall (Earth-616)|Heimdall]] (the owner of the Uru sword) break free from Mussan's terrorist group. After Heimdall was dispossessed from the influence of an alien rock, May was debriefed by S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]].{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 1}}

Some time later, May and [[Leopold Fitz (Earth-616)|Agent Leo Fitz]] were appointed to protect [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] from [[Ethan Slaughter (Earth-616)|Ethan Slaughter]], who shot most of [[Earth]]'s most powerful sorcerers. With the help of [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were able to do so and then traveled to [[Antarctica]], where the team found out about [[Horguun (Earth-616)|Horguun]], who produced the magic bullets with which Slaughter gunned the sorcerers down. They were able to stop Horguun and his workers. When they left, Fitz turned out to be possessed by [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]]'s mindless plague and shot the Scarlet Witch. {{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 5}} As Earth's most intelligent people slowly started transforming into [[Mindless Ones]] and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] was captured by Dormammu in the [[Dark Dimension]], May entered the Dimension alongside Coulson and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Jeremiah Warrick (Earth-616)|Jeremiah Warrick]]. May fought off the Mindless Ones, but was knocked out when she was not concentrating. As she woke from unconsciousness, she watched [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]] wreck Dormammu by absorbing the material his throne was made of.{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 6}}

Agent May teamed up with [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]] and together battled against a band of super-powered monstrosities created by [[Lucien Geist (Earth-616)|Dr. Lucien Geist]].{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 8}}

After the dissolution of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Melinda became an agent of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|F.B.I.]]. {{r|Marvels Vol 2 2}}
