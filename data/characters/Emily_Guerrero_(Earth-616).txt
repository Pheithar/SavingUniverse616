===Terrigen Cloud===

Emily emerged from her cocoon to see her grandfather standing over her as both of them knew that they had undergone some kind of metamorphosis. She ran out of her room to check on her brother, who had not yet emerged. During this time, Emily's grandfather told her that what had happened would allow them to save the world.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 4}}

===Avengers Unity Division===
Eight months passed, and Emily, going by the name Synapse, became a member of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Commander Steve Rogers]]'s [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]] as a representative of the Inhumans. Despite being unprepared for the public eye and life as a superhero, Rogers insisted that Emily stay with the team and vouched for her abilities, even though there was some tension with fellow member, [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], who was a [[Homo superior|mutant]]. Synapse's first battle as an Avenger was against the [[Super-Adaptoid (Earth-616)|Super-Adaptoid]].<!-- {{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 1}} -->

During the scuffle she tried to read the adaptoid's mind but to no avail, so she used her telepathy to control a flock of pigeons to attack it while the rest of the team were able to finish it off for good.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 1}}
