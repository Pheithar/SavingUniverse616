Zola was one of the first biochemists in history using notes left by the [[Deviants]].{{r|X-Factor Annual #3}} He was able to transfer his consciousness into a [[Arnim Zola's Robotic Body|robotic body]], allowing him to continue his experiments well into the next century.{{r|Captain America Vol 7 4}}

| History                 = 
===Early Life===
'''Dr. Arnim Zola''' was born and raised in the [[Weisshorn Mountains]] of [[Switzerland]] in the early part of the 20th Century. He was a child prodigy excelling in all areas of science and was accepted into the best schools in [[Europe]].{{Citation}}

===Studying Genetics===
Dr. Zola studied under [[Wladyslav Shinski (Earth-616)|Wladyslav Shinski]]. In 1928, he attended a genetics conference along with [[Jonathan Drew (Earth-616)|Jonathan Drew]], [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|Herbert Edgar Wyndham]], and [[Noah Black (Earth-616)|Noah Black]]. Zola was the first human genetic engineer in history, basing his work on some papers from the [[Deviants (Race)|Deviants]]. Later, Zola received secret aid from [[Phaeder (Earth-616)|Phaeder]] and his son [[Maelstrom (Earth-616)|Maelstrom]] in developing genetic advancements.{{r|X-Factor Annual #3}}

===Nazi Party===
After this, Dr. Zola found supporters in the Nazi party in Germany, who wanted to use his discoveries to assure the existence and triumph of a "master race".{{Citation}} 

===World War II===
During [[World War II]]; Dr. Zola aided the Nazi scientist [[Heinrich Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Heinrich Zemo]] in creating a series of androids which could expand from the size of a doll to over six feet tall.{{Citation}}

[[File:Arnim_Zola_(Earth-616)_from_Captain_America_and_Bucky_Vol_1_622_001.jpg|thumb|left|Arnim Zola creating the "Ubermensch"]]
Dr. Zola kidnapped the allies team of heroes the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]] and used the the DNA of  [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]], [[Human Torch (Jim Hammond)]] and [[Thomas Raymond (Earth-616)|Toro]] to create his new super-soldier the [[Ubermensch (Earth-616)|Ubermensch]]. However [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky]] arrived to save his friends and was able to hold off the Ubermensch long enough to free his friends from their captivity and they destroyed Zola's experiments.{{r|Captain America and Bucky #622}}

[[File:Arnim_Zola_(Earth-616)_from_Captain_America_Vol_1_209_002.jpg|left|thumb]]

Accounts vary, but at some point Zola established a process by which a person could project their mind onto a cloned body (It is believed that it was one of his first projects). He presented this process to [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Adolf Hitler]].{{Citation}} 

Dr. Zola later performed experiments of the town of [[Vliet]], [[Netherlands]]. He turned the townsfolk into monsters who were killed by the [[Invaders (Earth-616)|Invaders]]. To save himself from the infections he transferred his mind to his [[Zola's Robotic Body|robotic body]].{{r|Invaders Now! #2}}

===Hydra===
Talking with the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] he presented him with a pill to use to place himself in suspended animation. Zola then presented Hitler with a completed cloned body to which he could transfer his mind before death. After Hitler walked out, [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]], a fugitive, entered the room. Strucker invited Zola to take part in the establishment of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]].{{Citation}} 

Since around 1944, Strucker would think of Zola in his ESP-box body - this would support that Zola had switched bodies at this point.{{Citation}}

However, while another account does show Zola in his ESP box on the day that Hitler's original body died, Hitler as the [[Hate-Monger]] would later recall Zola was still in his original body.{{Citation}}

In any event, Zola prepared a series of bodies for Hitler to use in his new identity of the Hate-Monger. (Zola once told [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] that surgeons had extracted Hitler's brain and that he had preserved it to create a new body for it. This story appears to be a ruse to hide the truth about the Hate-Monger. Since then, the truth behind the Hate-Monger has been discovered, and is known to [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]], and [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]].){{Citation}}

Hitler, according to a soldier who was with him the day his original body died, supposedly recommended Zola's process to Baron Zemo. "like your FÃ¼hrer, Zemo", he said, "you will become... a God... Zola will see to that." It appears that Zemo did not for some reason undergo the process.{{Citation}}

===Modern Era===
[[File:Arnim Zola (Earth-616) from Captain America Vol 1 209 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Arnim Zola in Action]]
The Red Skull financed Zola's experiments since the end of World War II, allowing him to produce creations such as [[Primus (Android) (Earth-616)|Primus]] and [[Doughboy (Earth-616)|Doughboy]] - which would later help the Red Skull in his own schemes. Zola's association with the Red Skull led to their first fight against [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] in the jungles of Central America following Captain America's encounter with Arnim Zola's creation [[Man-Fish (Earth-616)|Man-Fish]]. Captain America was captured, but he managed to escape.{{r|Captain America #208}}

He tried to steal the discoveries of [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Dr. Bruce Banner]] by sneaking into an observatory. The observatory was destroyed in an explosion and Zola was believed to have died in it.{{r|Avengers Annual #13}} 

Inexplicably, Zola survived and fought Irish superheroine [[Molly Fitzgerald (Earth-616)|Shamrock]]. He did not count on Clover's probably-altering powers and his cybernetic body exploded. Zola threatened her in a parody-like tone - he made a reference to ''The Wizard of Oz'' and then insisted that he would came back, especially to a monthly series.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #24}}

After the devastation caused by [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], Zola collected humans from the rubble of New York City and endowed a girl with superpowers, creating [[Helen Takahama (Earth-616)|Jolt]]. Jolt would join the team [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], who would eventually go on to stop Zola.{{r|Thunderbolts #1|4}}

===Deadpool===
Zola has continued with his experiments at various locations around the globe, although his crimes against humanity had brought him to conflict with different self-proclaimed heroes, including Captain America many times and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]]. When fighting Deadpool, Zola created proto-husks of dead villains using their DNA; many of these were destroyed by Deadpool, except for four [[Gwen Stacy (Earth-616)|Gwen Stacy]] clones.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 0}}

===Kronas Corporation===
Zola later reunited with the Red Skull and criminal psychiatrist [[Johann Fennhoff (Earth-616)|Doctor Faustus]]. He was instrumental in a plan to capture and brainwash [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]] and manipulate her into assassinating Captain America.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 #25}} Following Captain America's death, Zola took great interest when he discovered that Carter was pregnant with Cap's child. During her imprisonment at the Red Skull's lair at the [[Kronas Corporation (Earth-616)|Kronas]], Zola subjected her to many experiments. It is believed that Sharon Carter miscarried her child while prisoner, but this remains unverified. Carter escaped and avenged herself against the Red Skull by fatally shooting him in the chest. Arnim Zola downloaded the Skull's essence into a robotic body similar to his own.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 #42}}

===Reborn===
Zola revealed to [[Norman Osborn]] that they were using a variation of [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Dr. Doom]]'s [[Time Platform]] to retrieve Steve Rogers from the past before Sharon damaged it, causing Steve Rogers to become unstuck in time. Steve is shown bouncing from place to place and time to time throughout his past.{{r|Captain America: Reborn #1}} In Latveria Doctor Zola had reassembled the device meant to bring back Captain America.{{r|Captain America: Reborn #4}}{{r|Captain America: Reborn #6}}

===Grandmaster===
The [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] developed a crush on the [[Homo sapiens|Mutant]] singer [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]]. To get her attention he arranged a roller derby against a group of villain which included Arnim Zola. The villains lost and the Grandmaster left the Earth in peace.{{r|X-Men: To Serve and Protect #4}}

===Spear of Destiny===
The [[Spear of Destiny]] was later recovered by an elderly Dutch man from the town of [[Vliet]] whose was killed by the [[Invaders (Earth-616)|Invaders]] when the townsfolk were turned into monsters by Arnim Zola. Using the Spear he made a deal with with [[Shuma-Gorath (Multiverse)|Shuma-Gorath]] to restore the town of Vliet to its former self in return for the Invaders' lives.{{r|Invaders Now! #3}} He granted his wish but along with the Nazi forces lead by Zola who once again prepared to mutate the townsfolk.{{r|Invaders Now! #1}} The Invaders arrived to help and found the man he attacked them with the spear.{{r|Invaders Now! #2|3}} After dealing with the Axis forces, the approached the man and offered to find a cure using modern medical science. They succeed and the townsfolk wished to return to the afterlife. He was determined to break his deal with Shuma-Gorath, but was stopped by Zola who killed him. Zola, now wielding the Lance, and the Axis attacked the Invaders just as Shuma-Gorath traveled to Earth.{{r|Invaders Now! #4}} They all battled together Captain America managed to capture it and throw it to [[Aarkus (Earth-616)|Vision]], who used it to stab Shuma-Gorath in the eye sending him back to his realm.{{r|Invaders Now! #5}}

===Lost Clone===
[[Edmund Heidler (Earth-616)|Edmund Heidler]] a clone of [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Adolf Hitler]] created by Dr. Zola to house the [[Hate-Monger (Earth-616)|Hate-Monger]]'s evolved Spirit. After a battle against [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] left him free the clone wandered off.{{r|Captain America #616}}

===M-Day===
After the events of [[M-Day]] in which most mutants lost their powers; [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] contacted some of the best minds in super-villain community including Zola. Surprisingly, few have offered to aid him in his quest to reverse the effects of M-Day.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #488}}

===Dimension Z===
He later escaped to a "[[Dimension Z (Arnim Zola)|Dimension Z]]", which he ruled and filled it with many of his creations. Eventually, Captain America found Zola hiding that alternate dimension, where time moved at an incredibly faster rate as compared to [[Earth]], and Zola had built a massive fortress, dubbing his new land Zolandia. Zola was making a massive army of genetically altered soldiers with the intent of conquering Earth. In the initial assault, Cap rescued a genetically engineered infant boy.{{r|Captain America Vol 7 1}}

In the decade stranded in Dimension Z, Cap raised the boy as his own son, [[Ian Rogers (Earth-616)|Ian Rogers]].{{r|Captain America Vol 7 2}} The two took up with the peaceful [[Phrox]], and eventually led a rebellion to stop Zola's forces, now commanded by Zola's daughter, [[Jet Zola (Earth-616)|Jet Black]]. One of his creations, [[Captains of Zolandia (Earth-616)|Captain Zolandia]], was a mutated clone of Captain America, he had his memories and tried to kill both Cap and Ian.{{r|Captain America Vol 7 7}}

Ian was later captured by Zola, and brainwashed to accept Zola as his father again, but eventually broke out of his control, only to be shot by [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]]. Eventually, Carter sacrificed herself to destroy Zola and his fortress, allowing Cap and a now reformed Jet to escape back to Earth.{{r|Captain America Vol 7 10}}

Zola was later revealed to be alive as he opened a portal in New York to lead an invasion from Dimension Z as a part of helping the Red Skull's newest plan.{{r|Captain America Vol 7 22}} After a battle across New York City with his mutants and [[Unvengers (Earth-616)|Unvengers]],{{r|Captain America Vol 7 23}} he departed with his daughter after driving a wedge between her and her new lover, Sam Wilson.{{r|Captain America Vol 7 25}}

===Hydra's Resurgence===
Zola was asked by the new [[Elisa Sinclair (Earth-61311)|Madame Hydra]] to join a new [[High Council of Hydra (Earth-616)|High Council of Hydra]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 14}} As a member of the High Council, he was there when [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Steve Rogers]] became the new head of Hydra after killing the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Skull]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 15}} When Hydra took over the United States, he ruled the country along with the other members of the High Council.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} Zola was sent to lead a Hydra force to invade the country of [[Wakanda]] to retrieve a remnant of sentient Cosmic Cube [[Kobik]], but Zola and his forces were always thwarted.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 18}}{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 5}}

After the fall of the Secret Empire, [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]] was forced to become an employee of [[Absolution Solutions (Earth-616)|Absolution Solutions]] and experiment on superhuman prisoners. Zola brainwashed [[Quicksand (Nguyet) (Earth-616)|Quicksand]] using a radioactive isotope and forced her to go after [[Miranda Manuel (Earth-616)|D-Cel]], a [[Homo superior|mutant]] capable of slowing the kinetic movement of people and objects. With help from D-Cel and [[Damage Control (Earth-616)|Damage Control]], the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] was able to stop Quicksand and re-collect her granular body.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 3}}

Damage Control filtered the grains of Quicksand's body that contained Zola's mind-controlling isotope, and Juggernaut made Zola use what remains of Quicksand to help her reconstitute herself. Quicksand was about to kill Zola, but she was convinced to stand down by Juggernaut, who wanted her help in changing how superhuman prisoners were treated.{{r|Juggernaut Vol 3 5}}

* '''Expert Biochemist:''' Arnim Zola is considered one greatest genetic engineers in history, a biochemist whose knowledge of genetics was enhanced by his study of [[Deviants (Race)|Deviant]] science. He studied under [[Wladyslav Shinski (Earth-616)|Wladyslav Shinsky]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1}}
* '''Robotic Expert:''' He was able to build a functioning robot body with the limited technology of the 1940s.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1}}
| Strength                = Arnim Zola Strength is dependent on the robotic chassis he is currently housed in.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1}}
| Equipment               = 
* '''[[Zola's Robotic Body]]:''' Zola's consciousness has been transferred in to a robotic body allowing him a form of immortality. If a body is destroyed his mind is downloaded to a spare body.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1}}
** '''ESP Box:''' Arnim Zola possesses the ability to mentally control his various genetic creations by means of the ESP Box mounted atop his torso and surgically attached to his central nervous system. Although most of the creatures possess limited intelligence and the capacity for creative thought, Zola can override their mental processes if he so desires. The ESP Box is a retractable device that can convert brain waves into electronic signals for transmission as telepathic commands within ordinary radio range. Normally, Zola is capable of controlling only his own organic creations, but if he remains linked to his support equipment, he can stimulate his own mental power to such a degree that he can create a psychokinetic network able to animate inorganic matter within radio range. Zola is unable to control natural organic life. The ESP Box also provides Zola with the following powers:
*** Mind Control
*** Mind Ray
*** Mind Transfer{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1}}

* Zola deploys mental commands to his creations in the form of energy bolts of approximately 100,000 volts. Similar in purpose to the ESP Box, the prod is limited in range to 18 feet and can only work on his own organic creations.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1}}

* Zola uses exotic weaponry, androids, and genetically engineered lackeys in his schemes. His androids (or "bio-servants") can host Zola's mind and life-force.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1}}
