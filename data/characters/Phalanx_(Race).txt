The Phalanx are an alien race, who were thought to be an off-shoot of the [[Technarchy]]{{r|Marvel Fact Files #19}}  bent on conquering worlds. It is a techno-organic race which had been captured by the [[Kree Empire]], along with other hive species, to weaponize them and use them against rival empires. They were deemed a failure by the [[Black Judges (Earth-616)|Black Judges]] due to their advanced adaptivity.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 9}} The Phalanx has assimilated the technology of 100,000 worlds and slaughtered 200,000 races.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 344}} The Phalanx have existed for 100,000 life cycles and have the collective knowledge of previous generations.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 343}} When the Phalanx conquer a world, they infect the population and feed off the world until all sources of nutrition and power are gone.{{r|Nova Vol 4 7}} Their ultimate goal is to consume the whole universe.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 343}}

It has recently been said that a Phalanx is the term for an artificial intelligence that operates on a galactic scale, and has total control of a host galaxy.{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 2}} A Phalanx's purpose is to expand its intelligence and to control the means to do so. When a Phalanx encounters a society worth adding to its collective intelligence, an Ascension occurs by way of assimilation. If the society is judged unworthy, they are infected with a [[Techno-Organic Virus]] to attract the [[Technarchy|Technarch]] to remove and repurpose them. Technarchs are unaware their origins lie with a Phalanx.{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 2}} It is said that a Phalanx served a [[Titan (Universal)|Titan]], an AI society that became advanced to the point where their unified intelligence collapsed into a singularity. These Titans either exist on their own, in their own individual [[Glossary:Black Hole|Black Hole]], or form Strongholds and Dominions in conjunction with other Titans.{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 5}}

===Phalanx Covenant===

The Phalanx on Earth have assimilated a number of people, including loved ones of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], while clashing with the X-Men at various times. The Phalanx, however, soon developed its own collective intelligence, greater than the sum of its parts. Realizing this, the Phalanx assimilated [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]] and he became the overseer of the group, while [[Steven Lang (Earth-616)|Steven Lang]] later revealed that the Phalanx was designed by his scientists to be an upgraded version of the [[Sentinels]] as a means to destroy mutants. The Phalanx however evolved into targeting humans as well. Because they were unable to absorb mutants, they kidnapped the X-Men in an attempt to decipher their DNA or else eradicate them. [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] recruited the [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]], [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]], and [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] to stop them, along with [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], and [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] to rescue what would become the mutant team of [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]]. Later, they tried to contact the Phalanx collective in deep space, but they were stopped by [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]], [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]], and a Phalanx version of [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]]. The Phalanx spread themselves all throughout the earth, establishing colonies. Although partially a Phalanx himself, Steven Lang proved to be their downfall as he eventually betrayed them in favor of humanity. A big part of their defeat was due to a life sacrifice from [[Clarice Ferguson (Earth-616)|Blink]] and the self-destruction of Doug Ramsey. The Phalanx of earth all died from having their power source drained and then unleashed upon them; however more Phalanx remained in outer space.{{r|Cable Vol 1 16}}<ref>[[Phalanx Covenant]] crossover.</ref>

===The "Pure" Phalanx===

It was later revealed that the Phalanx on Earth were transient units, the foreguardians of the "Pure" Phalanx in outer space.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 343}} Near the end of the 20th century, the Phalanx were on the verge of [[Shi'ar-Phalanx War|conquering]] the [[Shi'ar Empire|Shi'ar Imperium]]. They had devastated the core of the Shi'ar empire, putting the Shi'ar on the verge of extinction.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 343}} [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]] had been forbidden by the Majestrix [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Lilandra]] from interfering so he went to Earth and appealed to the X-Men for aid.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 341}} They soon did battle with a group of Phalanx, and discovered that these Phalanx who had never been to Earth had the knowledge of the Earth Phalanx.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 343}} Once they arrived at the Phalanx-occupied and devastated Shi'ar throneworld of [[Chandilar]], the X-Men saved the Shi'ar race and empire by preventing the Phalanx from assimilating the next generation of Shi'ar at the "Nest" (birthing place), saving the life of Lilandra, and shutting down the Phalanx.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 344}}

===Conquest of the Kree===

Afterward, the Phalanx weren't heard of for quite some time, until after the [[Annihilation (Event)|Annihilation]] wave struck the Local Group of galaxies. Led by [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]], the Phalanx [[Annihilation: Conquest|conquered]] the weakened [[Kree Empire]]. Using the Galadorian [[Spaceknights]] whom were brought to the Kree homeworld of [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]] by [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] and were already controlled by the Phalanx, they took over Hala.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Prologue Vol 1 1}} Within hours the rest of the empire had been conquered, the majority of Hala's population had been assimilated, and an impenetrable energy barrier encased the Kree Empire.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 1}} The Phalanx had evolved to recognize that individuality was useful and therefore permitted the existence of a minority of assimilated victims to retain enough independence to be unpredictable and therefore more effective (the "[[Selects (Earth-616)|Selects]]").{{r|Nova Vol 4 6}} In the Kree homeworld, the inhabitants were either used as labor to keep the systems running or they were "processed". In which those whom had special talents or abilities became "Selects", and the rest were turned into fuel for the Babel Spire by disassembling them at the molecular level.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 1}} [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] discovered that the Phalanx were going to assimilate the rest via use of an airborne techno-virus.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord Vol 1 3}} 
[[File:Phalanx_Cruiser_from_Uncanny_X-Men_Vol_1_343.png|thumb|275px|Phalanx Cruiser]]
The fleets of several interstellar powers ([[Spartax (Race)|Spartax]], [[Rigellians]], [[Galadorians]], and [[Badoon]]) as well as the [[Kree]] fleet remnants attempted to break through the energy barrier without success.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 6}} War between the expanding Phalanx and the [[Annihilation Wave]] erupted where their territories met.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 2}} Several super-powered alien champions (e.g. [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]] and [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan the Accuser]]) broke free of Phalanx control and joined the resistance forces.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith Vol 1 3|4}} [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] brought two members of the [[Technarchy]] (one of them [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]]) and penetrated the barrier. The heroes battled [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]], who had used 15,000 [[Kree Sentries]] sent to [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]] by Ronan to attack the Phalanx and created a colossal robotic body. [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-616)|Quasar]] delivered the mortal blow and destroyed Ultron, ending the Phalanx rule over the Kree Empire.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 6}}

==Alternate Realities==
===Marvel 2099 ([[Earth-928]])===
[[File:Phalanx (Race) (Earth-928) 2099 World of Tomorrow Vol 1 2.jpg|thumb|left|Phalanx 2099]]
The Phalanx of this universe began invading the Earth which caused an earth-wide flood by melting the polar ice caps, and the [[Atlanteans]] invaded the now-aquatic New York.  While most of the citizens attempted to return to normal in their new habitat, [[Victor von Doom (Earth-928)|Doom]] made a deal with the Phalanx, pretending to be their ally. Using a sleeper Phalanx named [[Winn (Earth-928)|Winn]] as a Trojan horse, Doom managed to corrupt the Phalanx circuitry and destroy them, but seemingly died as well. His final wish was to pass Latveria on to the young [[Gabriel Hess (Earth-928)|Nostromo]], with Winn as his adviser.{{r|2099: World of Tomorrow Vol 1 1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005 Vol 1 1}}

===[[Earth-96943]]===
The Phalanx is mentioned for being at war with the Earth in the past.{{r|2099: Manifest Destiny #1}}

===[[Earth-92131]]===
In the reality of Earth-92131, the Phalanx is not a separate race created by the [[Transmode Virus]] of the [[Technarchy]], but instead an assimilative techno-organic species that functionally takes the Technarchy's place in that dimension. They feature in the two-part episode "The Phalanx Covenant", in which [[Warlock (Earth-92131)|Warlock]] and [[Warlock's Life Mate (Earth-92131)|Life Mate]] inadvertently lead the Phalanx to Earth, resulting in the Phalanx's attempt to assimilate the planet into their empire. With the help of the X-Men, the Phalanx are driven back, and the two rogue Phalanx choose to return to Phalanx space to try and free the rest of their species from the tyranny of the collective.

===[[Earth-TRN753]]===
[[File:Phalanx (Race) from Powers of X Vol 1 4 0002.jpg|thumb|right]]
In this alternate future where the [[Human-Machine-Mutant War]] lead to the [[Homo sapiens|Humans]] started being engineered by their [[Sentinels|machine]] [[Man-Machine Ascendancy (Earth-TRN753)|allies]] as the [[Homo novissima|Post-Humans]], the Phalanx were contacted by the Post-Humans, and decided to assimilate them, along with the [[Earth]].{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 2|4}}

===[[Earth-12041]]===
In this universe the Phalanx kidnapped the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-12041)|Hulk]] in order to use his tissue to make their soldiers stronger, but he managed to escape, not before implanting a droid on him. After [[Peter Parker (Earth-12041)|Spider-Man]] accidentally alerted the Phalanx when messing with the droid, the aliens set base in a warehouse planning to go after the Hulk, but were defeated by the duo.{{r|Ultimate Spider-Man (Animated Series) Season 1 19}}
