===Early Life===
When he was two weeks old, Tomi Shishido said his first sentence. When he was three months old, he could already walk. By the time of his first birthday Tomi could read and write. At age four he was ranked among the top five artists in modern [[Japan]]. When he was six Tomi tried to kill himself for the second time and had composed his first opera. When he was thirteen, Tomi discovered that he was a [[Homo Superior|mutant]]. He developed low level telepathy, not being able to control minds but gaining the ability to read them at short distance. His eyes also gained the power to project energy that turns whoever he has eye contact with into stone. The Japanese media dubbed him as the Gorgon. Tomi soon learned how to fight and operate in daily life while blindfolded, in part thanks to his telepathic abilities. At this age he also devised a mathematical formula that proved, without question, the existence of God.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 26}} This latter event seemed to deeply affect Tomi, who came to believe that if God existed, then man could be nothing more than his slave. Shishido soon developed a great hatred to the sole concept of there being a God.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 24}}

===The Hand===
The Gorgon formed a mutant death cult called the [[Dawn of the White Light (Earth-616)|Dawn of the White Light]] and subjected Japan to many terrorist attacks during the next four years. When he was 18, he killed his family and only real friend to get the attention of the ancient ninja clan known as [[Hand (Earth-616)|The Hand]] and show them that he had no fear.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 26}} The former he petrified and kept in his apartment in Kobe. Soon after killing them, he was visited by the legendary [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] agent known as the [[Daniel Whitehall (Earth-616)|Kraken]]. He provided the young Gorgon with the [[Godkiller (Sword)|Godkiller]]. Gorgon asked why he was given such a valuable thing and the Kraken replied "Who am I to deny a man his destiny?" and left.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 11}} The Godkiller was one of two blades forged at the behest of [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus]] and [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (Earth-616)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] when their respective pantheons of deities, the [[Olympians]] and the [[Amatsu-Kami]], went to war. This gift gave the Gorgon the power to kill that which he hated more than anything else, Gods.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 10}}

Aspiring for darker and better things than the Dawn, Gorgon found the Hand sanctuary in rural Japan and slew all of its guards while blindfolded to demonstrate his abilities. Gorgon went inside and pledged his allegiance to the Hand's Jōnin. When the master questioned his dedication, Gorgon impaled himself with his own sword, telling the master to resurrect him with his dying breath. Impressed, they brought him back from death and he worked as one of their best warriors. Within a year, he became their High Priest and ran the ninja clan.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 26}}

[[File:Wolverine Vol 3 30 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Gorgon vs [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]]]

===Wolverine===
Men kidnap the son of Ichiro Yashida, the cousin of Wolverine's dead fiancé. The kidnappers asked for 1 million US dollars ransom and when all the authorities fail him, Ichiro called in Wolverine. Logan traveled to Japan and met with the captors only to find that it was a trap laid out for him. He fights off undead Hand warriors until only he and the kidnapper remain. Before he is able to get the location of the boy, Wolverine is impaled through the chest by Gorgon. Gorgon told Wolverine that "they" fed Ichiro's son to "their" pigs.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 20}}

He was responsible for the capture and brainwashing of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]. Although Wolverine was eventually freed from their control, Wolverine managed to infiltrate and steal technological blue prints from [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] that were very useful to Hydra.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 22}}

It is revealed that Gorgon became connected to Hydra and formed a relationship with [[Elsbeth von Strucker (Earth-616)|Elsbeth von Strucker]], the wife of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] leader [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 23}} Wolverine battled Daredevil while Elektra was forced to fight Gorgon. Both battles lasted a while, but when Wolverine is heavily injured the brainwashing wears off temporarily and he tells Matt that he was never really the target. Killing and brainwashing Elektra was the actual objective. Gorgon succeeded and Elektra is taken to the ceremonial stand for the brainwashing ritual.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 24}} Gorgon then sent Wolverine against the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] to battle his friends.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 25}}

Wolverine, under the brainwashing, committed a number of terrorist attacks resulting in the deaths of numerous costumed heroes and hundreds of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents. After this he became Leader of the Hand and Hydra.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 27}} 

[[File:Tomi Shishido and James Howlett (Earth-616) from Wolverine Vol 3 31.jpg|right|thumb|Gorgon's death]]
===Death===
Eventually, Gorgon attempted to assassinate [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] after S.H.I.E.L.D. launched an attack which destroyed his safe-house and killed Elsbeth von Strucker in the process. He was intercepted by Wolverine before he could complete the objective. The two engaged in a brutal battle, inflicting devastating injuries upon one another.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 30}} Gorgon managed to gain the upper hand and attempted to use his mutant ability to transform Wolverine into stone. Wolverine extracted his claws at the last moment, allowing Gorgon to see his own reflection in the claws. As a result, Gorgon's power was reflected back upon him. Once Gorgon had been turned into stone, Wolverine shattered his body.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 31}}

[[File:Tomi Shishido (Earth-616) from Secret Warriors Vol 1 2.png|left|thumb|Gorgon's Resurrection]]
===Return===
Years later, after Nick Fury discovered that Hydra had apparently been controlling S.H.I.E.L.D. from the start, Baron Strucker decided to create a [[High Council of Hydra (Earth-616)|High Council]] to rule Hydra and guide it in the coming war with Fury. He gathered long time Hydra agent the [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]], [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Earth-616)|Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]] as the new [[Madame Hydra]], the biological experiment known as the [[Hive (Earth-616)|Hive]] and the Kraken, the man who gave the Godkiller to the Gorgon, secretly killed and replaced by [[Jacob Fury (Earth-616)|Jake Fury]].{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 2}} Wanting a final member for his Council, Strucker had Hydra steal the Gorgons fragments from a decommissioned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 1}} He and his lieutenants then attacked the second Twilight Dawn, the Hand’s temple of resurrection, and forced the high priest to use the remaining stone fragments to resurrect the Gorgon. This act consumed the life of all the Hand members present. The ritual was successful and the Gorgon joined the new ruling Council.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 2}} Following his resurrection, Gorgon encountered Fury's [[Secret Warriors (Earth-616)|Secret Warriors]] when Hydra took over an ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. containment facility called [[Red Worm]]. Gorgon used his sword to slice off [[Yo Yo Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Yo Yo Rodriguez]]'s forearms. [[Alexander Aaron (Earth-616)|Phobos]], son of [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]] and the god of fear, attempted to use his powers on Gorgon but was ordered to retreat. Gorgon made a promise to himself that one day he would kill a god.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 3}}

Gorgon was present, with the rest of Hydra's ruling council, when the Secret Warriors invaded one of [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]]'s bases. [[Jerry Sledge (Earth-616)|Stonewall]] later confronted Gorgon because of what the latter did to Yo-Yo. Gorgon slashed at Stonewall's torso, but the latter eventually overpowered him by growing and using his added strength. Kraken, assuming that there must be a traitor in their midst, ordered a retreat of Hydra's forces, much to Gorgon's disappointment.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 5|6}}

Gorgon battled agents of [[Leviathan (Earth-616)|Leviathan]] when they attacked [[Nemesis (Hydra Base)|Nemesis]]. He easily defeated the attackers through the use of his sword and petrification. He made it to their leader and tortured him for answers. The leader revealed that they had [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]]. Gorgon rushed through Nemesis, only for Leviathan to escape with Viper.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 11|12}}

In [[Gehenna (Hydra Base)|Gehenna]], Gorgon caught [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Earth-616)|Madame Hydra]] getting ready to search for Viper, despite not being cleared psychically. Madame Hydra argued that Kraken was wasting his time searching for a possible traitor, while Leviathan may be extracting all their secrets from Viper. Gorgon was scanned by the re-purposed PSI-Agents, who determined that he was not a traitor. He then apologized for letting Madame Hydra leave. However, Kraken revealed that he had planted tracking devices on all of their transports and determined that Madame Hydra was in Russia.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 13|14}} 

At a meeting between Hydra and Leviathan, [[Viktor Uvarov (Earth-616)|Orion]] gave out an offer of subservience from Hydra. Strucker refused and ordered Gorgon to kill him. However, Orion survived a stab to the shoulder as [[Vasili Dassaiev (Earth-616)|Magadan]] knocked him away with his hammer. From that moment on, Hydra and Leviathan were at war.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 16}}

[[File:Alexander Aaron (Earth-616) vs. Tomi Shishido (Earth-616) from Secret Warriors Vol 1 21 002.jpg|right|thumb|Gorgon vs. Phobos]]
When Fury's team attacked [[Gehenna (Hydra Base)|Gehenna]], Gorgon faced off against [[Alexander Aaron (Earth-616)|Phobos]]. After an intense battle, Phobos' [[Grasscutter Sword|sword]] broke Gorgon's Godkiller. It appeared that Phobos had won, but Gorgon used one of the broken pieces of his blade to kill Phobos, thus fulfilling his vow to one day slay a god. After the battle, Gorgon took Grasscutter for himself as a spoil of war.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 21|22}}
[[File:Tomi Shishido (Earth-616) New Avengers Vol 2 18.png|left|150px|thumb|Dark Wolverine]]
===Dark Avengers===
When Hydra made an alliance with [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]], Gorgon became part of the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|New Dark Avengers]] as their Wolverine. Along with Madame Hydra he planned to kill Osborn when he became too dangerous and use the Dark Avengers to cause discord by serving as a voice of the disenfranchised. Gorgon and the other members of the Dark Avengers were defeated when their teammate [[Skaar (Earth-616)|Skaar]] revealed himself as a double-agent and summoned both the Avengers teams to take them down.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 18|23}}

===Avengers World===
[[File:Tomi Shishido (Earth-616) from Avengers World Vol 1 7 002.jpg|right|thumb]]
After sowing chaos in [[Madripoor]], the Hand and Gorgon (appointed again as their leader) used a ritual to awaken a dormant dragon upon which head the island rested.{{r|Avengers World #1}} [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]] tried to oppose him but failed.{{r|Avengers World #3}} The dragon then proceeded to fly to [[Hong Kong]], where it encountered the resistance from the [[Ascendants (Earth-616)|Ascendants]].{{r|Avengers World #7}}{{r|Avengers World #13}} Using [[Pym Particles]], Shang Chi turned into a giant and defeated the dragon in combat. However, before that he ripped Gorgon's base away from Madripoor and threw it several miles away.{{r|Avengers World #14}}

===All-New Wolverine===
Gorgon was less than pleased to learn the [[Orphans of X (Earth-616)|Orphans of X]] made use of the Hand's resources to attack [[Muramasa (Earth-616)|Muramasa]] and his people in an attempt to capture [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Gabrielle Kinney (Earth-616)|Honey Badger]], and [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]]. Upon his arrival he summarily executed the Orphans member within the Hand as punishment, and was convinced by Muramasa to provide Laura and Gabby with transportation so they could locate down Daken (who allowed himself to be captured after implanting [[Megan Kinney (Earth-616)|Megan Kinney's]] phone inside him to serve as a tracker) and the rest of the Orphans.{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 29}}

===The Scarlet Samurai===
Later on, Gorgon resurrected [[Mariko Yashida (Earth-616)|Mariko Yashida]] making her one of his enforcer known as the Scarlet Samurai.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 32}} Gorgon then planned to kill the current leader of the Clan Yashida, [[Shingen Harada II (Earth-616)|Shingen Harada II a.k.a The Silver Samurai]] in order to replace him with Mariko which would have resulted in an abrupt takeover of the Yashida Corp by the Hand.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 31}}

After taking care of the Silver samurai, Gorgon was able to acquire a fresh supply of a new designer made supplement called [[Regenix]] developed by Yashida Corp. The Regenix allowed its user to gain accelerated regeneration abilities but the drug was addictive and short lived and could cause the death of its users in case of prolonged use. Regenix also lost its effectiveness if exposed to low temperatures.

Gorgon used the Regenix for his army making his undead assassins almost unstoppable but the stock of Regenix was running low, and soon enough [[James Howlett (Earth-21923)|Old Man Logan]] became involved. Gorgon tasked the Scarlet Samurai to take care of Logan, and alongside the undead ninja of the Hand powered by Regenix, she was able to beat him. With Logan beaten, Gorgon then told Mariko to reveal her identity to him which horrified him.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 32}} Gorgon then told Mariko to kill Logan, but she hesitated, her memory of Logan slowing coming back, Logan used this opportunity to escape and swore he would kill Gorgon for what he did to her.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 32}} 

Not long after, the Silver Samurai revealed he survived Gorgon's previous attack and teamed up with Logan to stop him. The duo was able to defeat Gorgon's army and free Mariko from his control, seeing no other way Gorgon escaped to Madripoor where a rogue shipment of Regenix just arrived to the Island.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 33}} Gorgon intended to use the Regenix to conquer Madripoor but Logan and the Scarlet Samurai tracked him to Madripoor where they destroyed the last batch of Regenix before facing him.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 34}} Gorgon was able to stab Logan through the chest with a sword but the old man also managed to severely wounded him with his claws. Weakened and still bleeding from Logan's attack, Gorgon was then confronted by Mariko who defeated him but as she was about to kill him, he was saved by his ninja army and was able to escape.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 35}}

===House of X===
[[File:Tomi Shishido (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 5 4 003.jpg|thumb|right]]
Gorgon was eventually welcomed to the new mutant island of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], created by Xavier, Magneto, and [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira X]]. He entered through the teleportation gateway alongside other villainous and fractious mutants, who had been invited to join the nation in order to heal mutantdom and start over as a whole species together.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 5}}

Gorgon accepted Xavier's offer and joined Krakoa,{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}} and assumed the responsibility of defending the state in times of conflict or war as one of the [[Great Captains of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Great Captains of Krakoa]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}}

===[[X of Swords]]===
After [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Omniversal Majestrix Saturnyne]] organized a tournament between the mutants of Krakoa and the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|First Horsemen of Apocalypse]], Gorgon joined the [[Swordbearers of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Swordbearers of Krakoa]] as a representative of Krakoa,{{r|X of Swords: Creation Vol 1 1}} wielding his swords Godkiller and Grasscutter.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 13}} Gorgon took part in several contests;{{r|X-Force Vol 6 14}} the final contest he participated in pitted him against the [[White Sword (Earth-616)|White Sword]] and his [[One Hundred Champions (Earth-616)|One Hundred Champions]]. Gorgon was able to kill thirteen of the champions, awarding Krakoa a point for each slain champion, before he was killed by the White Sword. His sacrifice allowed Krakoa, which had been losing handily, to even the score with Arakko, setting them up for final victory.{{r|Cable Vol 4 6}}
