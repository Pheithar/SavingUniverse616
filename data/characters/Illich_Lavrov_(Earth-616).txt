Later on, they helped the original mutant Soviet Super-Soldiers escape government capture.

Sometime after that, Sibercat was made a member of the [[Winter Guard (Earth-616)|Winter Guard]] when Siberforce and the People's Protectorate merged into a single group. The group battled the [[Mandarin]] when his 'Dragon of Heaven' entered Russian airspace.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #9|10}}
