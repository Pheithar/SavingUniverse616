===Early years===
Bounty is a renowned extradimensional bounty hunter. She claimed never fail to track her targets, to have been romanced by pirates, gladiators and emperors, and to have killed a personification of [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 2|; [[Bounty (Humanoid) (Earth-616)|Bounty]]'s entry}}

===Earth===
On several occasions Bounty had run-ins with superheroes, including the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]. She displayed signs of incredible strength, a heightened sense of smell, a knowledge of how to use many different weapons and a very high biological resistance for Earth's alcohol.{{citation}}

In the past (on Earth), she damaged the Fantastic Four's headquarters, had romantic feelings for the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]], was formally associated with The [[Bacchae]], fought against Spider-Man, and interfered with a "gang" dispute between The Golden Horde and The [[Bacchae]].{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Annual 2000}} Bounty helped the Fantastic Four defeat [[Hades (Earth-616)|Pluto]].{{citation}}
