===Early Life===
Angela del Toro was born and raised in the [[Bronx]], [[New York City]]. She is the niece of [[Hector Ayala (Earth-616)|Hector Ayala]], the first hero to assume the name "[[White Tiger]]". Hector retired after a man named [[Gideon Mace (Earth-616)|Gideon Mace]] murdered most of his family.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #52}} Angela grew up with her Uncle Hector and his friends, including [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|"Uncle Danny", aka Iron Fist]]. She went on to be an officer of the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]] for four years, gaining a bachelor's in political science and masters in criminology before attending [[Quantico]] and graduating in the top top percent of her class{{r|White Tiger Vol 1 1|2}} to become an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|F.B.I.]] agent.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 40}}

===Daredevil===
After returning to the White Tiger identity for one night, Hector found himself wrongly accused but ultimately convicted of murder. He panicked and was shot dead by security while trying to flee the courthouse.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 42}} Somehow, Hector's Tiger amulets were delivered to Angela, leading her to assume she was meant to be the next White Tiger. An overwhelmed Angela asked [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]] Hector's attorney and the recently-outed "[[Daredevil]]" to help her decide what to do with them. Murdock reluctantly gave her some instruction as a fledgling super-heroine.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 #77|79}}

===White Tiger===
[[File:Angela del Toro (Earth-616) from White Tiger Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|"White Tiger"]]
Angela left the FBI shortly after Murdock's arrest and incarceration in [[Ryker's Island]], and continued to operate as a fledgling vigilante dressed in black, despite the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] being discussed though not yet passed at that time. Struggling at first, Angela was approached by [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] who on behalf of Murdock arranged for Angela to have a fitted superhero costume of her own and thus further establish her new lifestyle. Natasha also helped Angela in her first mission - locating the source of illegal identification documents as well as the man who killed her former partner Agent Driver. 

During this time Angela began working with 212 Security and had brief run-ins with [[Piet Voorhees (Earth-616)|King Cobra]], who was working with Driver's killer, as well as [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|The Lizard]] and even [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] and also encountered [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Danny Rand]] who had assumed the Daredevil persona, though she deduced his identity. While working alongside other heroes as White Tiger, Angela was able to take down [[Sano Orii (Earth-616)|Sano Orii's]][[Yakuza (Earth-616)|Yakuza]] operation which led to him committing ritualistic suicide after accidentally killing his father.{{r|White Tiger #1|6}}

===Hand===
[[File:Maki Matsumoto (Earth-616) and Angela del Toro (Earth-616) from Daredevil Vol 2 113 0001.jpg|left|thumb]]
Much later, Murdock was a free man once again but was now targeted by [[Hand (Earth-616)|The Hand]] - seeking to make him their new leader. Many of his friends and allies - including Angela, were also targeted as a means to make him comply. Hand operative [[Maki Matsumoto (Earth-616)|Lady Bullseye]] ambushed Angela in her own home and stabbed her through the chest, killing her, but only to resurrect her as a new Hand vessel.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 113}}

From this point onward, Angela aided Lady Bullseye in her crusade to break Murdock alongside [[Carlos LaMuerto (Earth-616)|Black Tarantula]], Carlos LaMuerto. Carlos, possessing a healing factor, was immune to Hand conditioning and posed as an operative to stop Lady Bullseye's agenda and subsequently cured Angela of her own conditioning. When Lady Bullseye was cast out of The Hand for being untrustworthy and Murdock assumed leadership, Angela and Carlos stood behind him as his top lieutenants.{{r|Daredevil #501|507}}

===[[Shadowland]]===
After [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]] destroyed an entire city block, killing many civilians, Murdock ordered the Hand to be more aggressive towards criminals, culminating in Murdock himself killing Bullseye in cold blood. Murdock's new murderous behavior was the result of possession by The Beast - an ancient demonic entity placed within The Hand by the evil [[Snakeroot (Earth-616)|Snakeroot Clan]]. Angela, as it transpired was still very much corrupted by The Hand's dark influence and was, in fact, acting as Snakeroot's spy within Matt's inner circle. Now Matt's most aggressive servant, Angela ignited her own ferocity by reveling in The Hand's dark justice; she forcibly prevented other superheroes from having contact with him and ordered a kill on [[Franklin Nelson (Earth-616)|Foggy Nelson]] and [[Dakota North (Earth-616)|Dakota North]] for trying as well. Her malice escalated when during a conversation with Carlos in which he voices his opinions on Shadowland and Matt's rule, she stabs him through the back and throws him off a rooftop to die, later that same night she offers to personally slit Foggy's throat when he breaks into Shadowland to try and reason with Matt. During the final confrontation against The Beast to save Matt's soul, Angela is subdued by [[Izo (Earth-616)|Master Izo]].{{r|Shadowland #5}}

In the aftermath of Shadowland, Dakota tracked down Carlos, who is alive and being cared for by the [[Linda Carter (Earth-616)|Night Nurse]]. Carlos mourns Angela's fall into darkness, believing that his healing powers wore off and failed to save her.{{r|Daredevil #512}}

===New Revengers===
[[File:New Avengers Vol 4 7 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
Angela was eventually imprisoned, and she was transferred at some point to the [[Ryker's Island|Cellar]], New York's newest super-penitentiary. She was approached by the [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]], [[World Headquarters for International Scientific/Philosophical Experimentation and Research (Earth-616)|W.H.I.S.P.E.R.]]'s leader, and offered a chance at taking revenge on [[Ava Ayala (Earth-616)|Ava Ayala]], Angela's aunt, who had taken possession of the Amulets of Power, an action which Angela believed to not have been rightful.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 7}}

The Maker also equipped Angela with a set of Amulets of Power from an alternate universe, which allowed her to become the vessel of a White Tiger from a said an alternate reality. Now repowered, Angela tracked down Ava to [[Rome (Italy)|Rome]] and confronted her. In the middle of the ensuing battle, the original White Tiger that Ava channeled betrayed her and merged with Angela's, leaving Ava completely powerless, while making Angela twice as powerful as before.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 7}}

Angela was still completely loyal to the Hand, but they allowed her to continue working with the Maker, believing his plans could benefit them. As part of his alliance with the Maker, Angela joined his [[New Revengers (Earth-616)|New Revengers]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 7}}

When the New Revengers attacked [[Avenger Base Two]], the HQ of Ava's team, [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|Avengers Idea Mechanics]], Angela confronted her.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 14}} During the subsequent fight, Ava managed to snatch Angela's Amulets of Power and destroy it, freeing her from the possession of both the White Tigers and the Hand.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 15}}

Both Ava and Angela fought against the New Revengers back-to-back,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 16}} and continued working in tandem when Ava's boss [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] targeted rogue A.I.M. splinter cells to shut down. With the mission accomplished, Ava decided to retire from being the White Tiger and convinced Angela to do the same.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 18}}

*'''Enhanced Agility''': Angela's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 13}}
