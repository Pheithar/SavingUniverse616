===Overview===
Mordred was the illegitimate son of [[Arthur Pendragon (Earth-616)|King Arthur Pendragon]] and his half-sister [[Morgause (Earth-616)|Morgause]]. [[Merlyn (Otherworld)|Merlin]] prophesied that a son born on May Day would rise up and destroy both him and [[Camelot]]. To prevent this, Arthur had all the children born that day put on a boat with a leak and sent to sea. Mordred survived and eventually returned to his mother, where he was raised and educated to be a knight.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 8}}

Mordred's history is steeped in the Arthurian legend, and it can be presumed that these legends are facts on [[Earth-616]].

===Adulthood===
As an adult, Mordred began working with his aunt [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]] to overthrow his father King Arthur and take control of Camelot.{{r|Black Knight #1}} His earliest recorded activities was when he went on a hunt with King Arthur and found the injured knight [[Beliar (Earth-616)|Sir Belair]] whom unknown to them at the time was the son of the demon [[Asmodiar (Earth-616)|Asmodiar]].{{r|Marvel Preview #22}}

Not long after this, Merlin became aware of Mordred and Morgan's plots to destroy the kingdom and sought out [[Percival of Scandia (Earth-616)|Sir Percy of Scandia]] whom he trained to be his secret warrior the Black Knight. Mordred soon took King Arthur on a hunt, having hired assassins to eliminate him, however he was saved by the Black Knight. The Knight was officially knighted by the king, who promised to never ask for the Knight's true identity, much to Mordred's chagrin. Likewise, while the Black Knight was aware that Mordred was behind this and other future schemes, he could never find the evidence needed to incriminate Mordred.{{r|Black Knight #1}} Eventually, Merlin had created a number of ebony weapons out of the [[Starstone (Merlin)|Starstone meteorite]] and offered only one to the Black Knight, believing that the correct weapon could help halt the downfall of Camelot. After the Black Knight chose the [[Ebony Blade]], Merlin used his magics to seemingly destroy the other weapons, unaware that both Mordred and Morgan were overhearing and prevented the destruction of the Ebony Staff, which would be the key to Camelot's destruction. Mordred sent the weapon to be reforged into an Ebony Dagger and then resumed his attempts against the throne in the meantime.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes #17}} Shortly thereafter, Mordred briefly usurped the throne of Camelot when he had his minions kidnap King Arthur in the night and toss him in the royal dungeons below the castle. However the Black Knight managed to free the king, forcing Mordred to give up the throne.{{r|Black Knight #1}}

When King Arthur later went out to visit the neighboring baronies, Mordred and Morgan le Fey worked with the Norman conqueror [[Robert Du Quincy (Earth-616)|Sir Robert du Quincy]] to invade and conquer Camelot. However this invasion was thwarted by the Black Knight foiling Mordred's plans.{{r|Black Knight #2}} Mordred then became focused on learning the true identity of the Black Knight. During a contest battle between the knights of Camelot, Mordred paid [[Guy of Gascombe (Earth-616)|Sir Guy of Gascombe]] to injure the Black Knight in battle. Before Mordred can unmask him, the Black Knight was spirited away by Merlin. Mordred then began walking about the castle, purposely bumping into people to see if they shared the same injuries as the Black Knight. To his surprise, he found that his distant relative, the seemingly cowardly Sir Percy, shared those same injuries. However when Mordred and his minions confronted Sir Percy in his chambers, they were surprised to see both Percy and the Black Knight together, unaware that the "Black Knight" was Merlin wearing the fabled armor. Mordred fled and was soundly defeated by the real Black Knight, thus preserving his double identity. Not long after this, during King Arthur's birthday and celebratory lion hunt, Mordred paid a number of Gypsies to unleash too many lions for King Arthur to handle on his own. This plot would have succeeded had not the Black Knight been there to once more thwart him.{{r|Black Knight #3}}

Not long after this, Mordred hired French-Sicilian pirates to kidnap King Arthur, his ward [[Rosamund (Earth-616)|Lady Rosamund]] and Sir Percy among others. He then returned to Camelot and claimed the throne, sending the [[Knights of the Round Table (Earth-616)|Knights of the Round Table]] on false leads to rescue the king. However Sir Percy managed to escape captivity and as the Black Knight led the knights of Camelot to their leader and rescued him, Mordred once more gave up the throne.{{r|Black Knight #4}} Later, Mordred conspired to overthrow Camelot with the help of [[Sir Gilles (Earth-616)|Sir Gilles]] using a "Trojan horse" disguised as the Dragon of Kentswood Swamp, but this plot was thwarted by the Black Knight.{{r|Black Knight #5}}

===Fall of Camelot and Death===
After learning of the affair between [[Guinevere (Earth-616)|Queen Guinevere]] and [[Sir Lancelot (Earth-616)|Sir Lancelot]], and with [[England]] in the middle of a civil war Mordred then put his plans into bringing down Camelot into full force.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 8}}

During the final battle, Mordred used the Ebony Dagger and succeeded in eventually slaying King Arthur as well as the original Black Knight, but also was felled by the Knight himself.{{r|Mystic Arcana Black Knight #1}}{{r|Black Knight Vol 2 1}}{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes #17}} However as Mordred died, he threw his spirit into the [[Netheria|Netherworld]] in order to cheat death.{{r|Black Knight Vol 2 2}}

===Spirit===
Mordred's spirit eventually found itself in the 12th Century during the [[Crusades]] and plotted to foil the plans of [[Richard Plantagenet (Earth-616)|King Richard]] by orchestrating events so that Richard was captured by the Muslim armies in an attempt to change history. He was assisted in this era by [[Chandu (Earth-616)|Chandu the Wizard]] and his demonic minions. Learning of this plot, Merlin took the spirit of [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Dane Whitman]], the Black Knight of the modern era (who at the time had been turned into stone), and sent his spirit back in time to possess the body of his descendant [[Eobar Garrington (Earth-616)|Eobar Garrington]] the Black Knight of the Crusades, to rescue King Richard.

Seeking to restore Dane Whitman to flesh and blood [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] and Dane's teammates in the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] were pulled back in time to the 12th Century. There they joined the Black Knight in battling Mordred and Chandu. Mordred attempted to gain control of the powerful [[Evil Eye]] to use against his foes, but he was stopped by the time travelling [[Prester John (Johann) (Earth-616)|Prester John]] who then used the Eye to banish both Mordred and Chandu.{{r|Defenders #11}}

===Resurrection===
Mordred was later resurrected in the Modern Age and served the demonic [[Necromon (Earth-616)|Necromon]], coming into conflict with the most recent Black Knight (Whitman) and [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]].{{r|Captain Britain Summer Special #1}} Eventually, Necromon was defeated and Mordred was banished into the [[Outer Dark]].{{r|Hulk Comic (UK) #42}}

[[File:Mordred (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 3 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Queen's Vengeance commander]]Eventually, Mordred was returned when Morgan le Fay summoned him, as she needed a masculine sorcerer/familiar to complete her future schemes.{{r|Black Knight Vol 2 4}}

Mordred was later involved with Morgan as she used the [[Norn Stones]] to reshape reality, overlapping it with [[Earth-398]]. In this new reality, Morgan ruled over a medieval world of magic and commanded the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] under the name [[Queen's Vengeance (Earth-398)|Queen's Vengeance]].{{r|Avengers Vol 3 1}} Eventually, Mordred was defeated by the Avengers and their recently resurrected ally [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]]. Mordred was presumably banished with Morgan when reality was restored to its natural order.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 3}} He later returned and attempted to gather all of the items forged from the Starstone.{{r|Black Knight: Curse of the Ebony Blade Vol 1 2}}

| Powers                  = Sorcery. Mordred has the particular gift to know the weakness in all things, including a person's mentality. He has used this to gain a psychological advantage against his foes.{{r|Black Knight: Curse of the Ebony Blade Vol 1 1}}

| Equipment               = Mordred was shown using a gem referred to as a "Bloodstone" in his attempt to recover the Starstone items. The nature and origin of this item has not been revealed. It may be a [[Bloodgem]], as [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]] was interested in obtaining it.

However, he has no connection to [[Modred (Earth-616)|Modred the Mystic]]. {{cl|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Mystic Arcana: The Book of Marvel Magic #1}} confirms it.
