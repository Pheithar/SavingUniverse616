===Origin===
It was established in October 1945 after [[World War II]] in order to prevent another such conflict. The [[United Nations Headquarters]] is based in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], and is subject to extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in [[Geneva (Switzerland)|Geneva]], [[Nairobi]], and [[Vienna (City)|Vienna]].

===[[World War II]]===
In 1945, representatives of 50 countries met in [[San Francisco]] at the United Nations Conference on International Organization to draw up the United Nations Charter. At the end of the war the United Nations officially comes into existence when the Charter is ratified by the [[United States of America]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]] along with the rest of the [[British Empire]], and by a majority of other signatories.

===[[Korean War]]===
In 1950, the UN Security Council passed a resolution which called on all members to help repel the invasion of [[South Korea]] by [[North Korea]]. The motion was only passed because the Soviet delegate, who would have certainly vetoed it, was absent because he was boycotting Security Council meetings until China was admitted to the UN. Fourteen UN nations agreed to help. It was the first real military test for the UN.{{r|Combat Kelly #1}} In 1951, the UN was forced retreated when the Chinese forces intervened.{{r|Kent Blake of the Secret Service #7}} In 1953, the armistice was signed, with the front line accepted as the new border between the two sides.{{r|Marvel Mystery Handbook 70th Anniversary Special #1}}

===[[Modern Age]]===
The United Nations building was the site of several attempts by Prince [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] of [[Atlantis]] to befriend or make war on the surface world.{{r|Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner #1}}{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #1}}{{r|Sub-Mariner #25}}

For a time, the Avengers operated under the jurisdiction of the United Nations as a global peacekeeping force.{{r|Avengers #329}} When their charter prevented them from acting in the war torn nation of Genosha, however, chairwoman Black Widow ended the Avengers' association with the UN in order to better protect the world without bureaucratic shackles.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #101}}

At the UN General Assembly meeting, the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities (Earth-616)|Commission on Superhuman Activities]] decided to charge [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]], [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] and [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Timothy Dugan]] for terrorism, but the trial was halted by the [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The charges were dropped as soon as Iron Man defeated the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man #28}}

[[Kofi Annan (Earth-616)|Kofi Annan]] was the Secretary General of the United Nations at the end of the 20th century. He occasionally worked with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] as they transitioned from an American to a global super-hero team, especially when the trans-dimensional Zodiac Cartel pulled several national capitals from Earth’s dimension.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 42}}

When Kang the Conqueror declared war on the 21st century, his first strike was a show of force using Damocles base to obliterate the United Nations building, although he preserved the lives of the delegates and staff inside.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 #41|42}}

[[Stephen Lang (Earth-616)|Stephen Lang]] and [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar]] proposed to the UN the concept of the [[Mutant Response Division (Earth-616)|Mutant Response Division]], [[Gabrielle Haller (Earth-616)|Gabrielle Haller]] opposed to the proposition, quoting as example the fail of the [[Sentinels|Sentinel Program]]. The task-force was assembled anyway.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 17}} 

When a sea monster emerged from the [[East River]] between [[Manhattan]] and [[Queens]] in [[New York City]], the Secretary-General of the UN, [[Ban Ki-moon (Earth-616)|Ban Ki-moon]], called upon [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] to handle the situation.{{r|Hercules Vol 4 1}}

Ban Ki-moon later visited the [[Triskelion]], the headquarters of the [[Ultimates (Earth-616)|Ultimates]], and expressed the worries of some U.N. member states about the recent cooperation between [[Wakanda]] and the [[United States of America]] to King [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|T'Challa]], stating their alliance could extend to the military arena. T'Challa dismissed Ban's claims as unfounded fears, and stated that the United States would only slow Wakanda down.{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 1}}
