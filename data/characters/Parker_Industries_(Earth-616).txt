{{Quote| We're not here to build a '''fortune'''. We're building the '''future'''.|[[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]]|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 1}}
===Overview===
'''Parker Industries'''  ('''[[NYSE]]:''' PI) was an [[United States of America|American]] global aerospace, defense, security and advanced technologies company with worldwide interests. It is headquartered at the [[Baxter Building]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Parker Industries employed thousands people with forty-seven buildings around the world.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 2}}. The President and CEO of Parker Industries was scientist turned industrialist [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]], who is secretly the super-hero [[Spider-Man]].

===Early Days===
After being fired from [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon Labs]], [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Otto Octavius]] (who at the time was inhabiting [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]]'s body) decided to create his own company, Parker Industries.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 22}} After Otto handed back control of Peter's body to Peter, and the defeat of the Goblin Nation, Peter himself took up the reins to manage the company and publicly announced that he was no longer working with Spider-Man. One of the Peter's first announcements after taking control of the company would be putting its cybernetics project on hold in order to focus on the capture, curing and de-powering of [[Maxwell Dillon|Electro]], and to develop a new super-villain prison.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 2}}

While searching to get energy readings from Electro’s last known location Peter and some employees arrived at the spot which was on fire. After Peter - as Spider-Man - saved everyone inside with the help of fireman Ollie Ollivera, Black Cat stole one of their devices, found Electro with it, and persuaded him to help her get Spider-Man. {{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 3}}[[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]]'s father [[John Jonah Jameson, Sr. (Earth-616)|John Jonah Jameson Sr.]] became the biggest investor to Parker Industries.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 5}} Parker Industries was successful in curing Electro after successfully trapping him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 6}}

When he was released from prison, [[Clayton Cole (Earth-616)|Clayton Cole]] briefly was in the services of [[Minn-Erva (Earth-616)|Dr. Minerva]] during her fight with Spider-Man. When [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] was seen carrying an [[Inhumans (Race)|Inhuman]] baby that she has rescued from Doctor Minerva, Clayton turned against Doctor Minerva and helped Kamala Khan. Upon being recognized by Spider-Man, Clayton was offered a job at Parker Industries which he accepted.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 8}}

Parker Industries competed against [[Alchemax]] to determine who will get the contract for the new supervillain prison. Alchemax members [[Mark Raxton (Earth-616)|Mark Raxton]] and [[Tiberius Stone (Earth-616)|Tiberius Stone]] hired [[Ghost (Earth-616)|Ghost]] to sabotage Parker Industries.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 16}}

===Multinational Conglomerate and Fall===
Over the following months, Otto Octavius (whose consciousness then inhabited the body of the Peter Parker's robotic assistant, the [[Living Brain (Earth-616)|Living Brain]]) routinely hacked into the systems to manipulate the market in their favor,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 29}} which saw the expansion of Parker Industries into a global conglomerate with numerous bases in different countries, including England and China. The company became one of the main producers of technology for the general public, including a smart watch called the "Webware." Parker turned his alter-ego of Spider-Man into a guise of his bodyguard, and the Web-Slinger also became the company's mascot. The company also became a tech supplier for [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 1}}

Short time after [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s take-over of the United States, [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Superior Octopus]] besieged the resources of Parker Industries with the intention of taking back the business he created.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 29}} Octavius destroyed the offices of the company in [[London (England)|London]] and raided [[Horizon University (Location)|Horizon University]] in [[San Francisco]]. With the [[Baxter Building]] shut off from the rest of the world together with the all of Manhattan inside a [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]] dome, Octavius confronted Spider-Man in what became the last stronghold of the company, its building in Shanghai.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 30}} All of the locations targeted by Octavius contained the fail-safes of the company necessary to prevent him from accessing to its systems. With Octavius having only one fail-safe left to take care of, Peter decided to resort to a backup plan, and had everyone within the building obliterate all systems and activating a computer worm that would destroy all programs, including the Webware, leaving the company in an irreparable state.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 31}} The company was eventually dissolved later on.{{r|Avengers Vol 7 11}}
