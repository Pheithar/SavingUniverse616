===Origin===
Jamie Madrox's [[Homo superior|mutant]] ability was apparent as early as his birth. He created his first duplicate when the doctor smacked him on the bottom.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 11}} Two weeks later, [[Daniel Madrox (Earth-616)|Jamie's father]] resigned from the [[Los Alamos]] Nuclear Research Center and moved his family to an intentionally [[Madrox Family Farm|isolated farm]] in [[Lawrenceville]], [[Kansas (State)|Kansas]]{{r|Giant-Size Fantastic Four #4}} at the suggestion of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]]. Later, [[Dafydd ap Andras (Earth-6124)|Damian Tryp]], of [[Singularity Investigations]], made his own offer to look after Jamie, claiming that Jamie was not in fact a mutant, but a "[[Homo Killcrop|changeling]]," a predecessor to mutants, who manifest their powers at birth. Jamie's parents, however, refused to give Jamie to Tryp.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 11}} From a young age, Madrox was given a special suit to wear that would neutralize his mutant power, but, before this could be explained to him, a freak tornado killed his parents when he was 15,{{r|Giant-Size Fantastic Four #4}} later revealed to have been caused by Tryp, who had also manipulated Jamie's memories to make him forget his part in the accident.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 12}}

Madrox spent the next six years alone caring for his parents' farm. When he was 21, malfunctioning control elements in the suit caused a power surge that released his inhibited power and caused the suit to begin absorbing ambient electrical energy. Confused, frightened, and driven mad by isolation, Madrox felt himself drawn to [[New York City]]. There, he clashed with the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] until Xavier arrived to defuse the situation.{{r|Giant-Size Fantastic Four #4}} With the help of Xavier and [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]], Madrox's suit was repaired and he accompanied Xavier back to his mansion in [[Westchester County]]. There, Madrox's temporary madness was cured and, after learning to cope with his powers, he was invited to join the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. He declined, and instead accompanied Xavier to [[Muir Island]] where he became a laboratory assistant to mutant researcher [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Doctor Moira MacTaggert]].{{citation}}

===Muir Island===
Madrox's ability proved invaluable to MacTaggert, and he quickly became a regular fixture on Muir. Unfortunately, Madrox also found himself battling against threats such as the alien [[Davan Shakari (Earth-616)|Eric the Red]] and the reality-altering mutant [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]], who possessed one of Madrox's duplicates in order to escape confinement on Muir. Proteus's possession instantly killed the duplicate, and for the first time Madrox felt the severe psychic backlash caused by the death of one of his duplicates. After Proteus was defeated, Madrox again declined to join the X-Men, preferring to remain on Muir Island with Moira and her lover, the X-Man [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]]. Soon after, Banshee's daughter [[Theresa Rourke (Earth-616)|Siryn]] came to live on Muir. She and Madrox ultimately grew close.{{citation}}

Eventually, one of Madrox's duplicates sought to remain apart from the original and live his own life. To this end, he drugged the original Madrox and joined Moira and Siryn on a trip to the U.S. to search for [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] and [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]], two missing members of the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]]. Eventually finding the runaway mutants as members of the [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]]'s teenage gang, the [[Fallen Angels (Earth-616)|Fallen Angels]], the duplicate Madrox and Siryn were persuaded to join by the alien [[Ariel (Coconut Grove) (Earth-616)|Ariel]]. During their time with the group, the duplicate Madrox and Siryn engaged in a brief romance. Eventually, the true nature of the Fallen Angels was revealed to be a ruse by aliens from the [[Coconut Grove]] planet who sought to cure their race's stalled evolution by experimenting on mutants. Defeating the aliens, the team returned to Earth, but apparently disbanded soon after. The duplicate and Siryn rejoined Moira at the Xavier Institute to return to Muir; however, the duplicate had no desire to be reabsorbed and so created another duplicate to take his place on the return trip while he secretly remained in the U.S.{{citation}}

===X-Factor===
Later, the original Madrox was possessed by the psionic entity the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] during the villain's takeover of Muir; after his defeat, Madrox joined the government-sponsored [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] team. Unknown to Madrox, the duplicate that had joined the Fallen Angels years before had since found a place in the [[Nasty Boys (Earth-616)|Nasty Boys]], a team of super-powered mercenaries employed by geneticist [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]]. With the help of [[Steven Shaffran (Earth-616)|Senator Steven Shaffran/Ricochet]], a mutant with the ability to turn other mutants' powers and fears against them, the duplicate convinced the Nasty Boys, and Madrox himself, that he was the original. Madrox merged with the duplicate, but it was a ruse; he "disassembled" the duplicate from the inside and remained the dominant personality in order to expose Shaffran and stop Sinister.{{citation}}
[[File:X-Factor Vol 1 146.jpg|180px|left|thumb]]

Later, when most of the team were busy with another assignment, Madrox and his teammate [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] were sent to investigate a murder case in [[Maine (State)|Maine]] in which the prime suspect was a young mutant named [[Rachel Argosy (Earth-616)|Rhapsody]], who had been fired from her music teaching job after turning blue and first manifesting her ability to entrance others with music. The man responsible for terminating her employment was found dead two days later, with Rhapsody apprehended at the scene of the crime. Exposed to the effects of Rhapsody's power, Madrox became convinced of her innocence and was set to break her out of prison when the truth was revealed. Rhapsody had used her power on the victim in an effort to make him see the error of his decision to fire her, only to accidentally cause his death.{{citation}}

Following an attempted assassination of Xavier supposedly by the mutant soldier from the future, [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], X-Factor and the X-Men teamed up to capture Cable's team of young mutants, [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]]. Among X-Force's number was Siryn, who confronted Madrox over their past relationship. Madrox revealed to Siryn that although he retained all the memories of her relationship with his renegade duplicate, he possessed none of the related emotional attachment.{{citation}}

Among his X-Factor teammates, Madrox formed a close bond with [[Guido Carosella (Earth-616)|Strong Guy]]. The pair shared an odd sense of humor and often joked around much to team leader [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]]'s chagrin. A psychiatric analysis by [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Doctor Leonard Samson]] ultimately revealed the reason for Madrox's humorous attitude. His living alone for many years as a child created an almost pathological need for attention to ensure he would never be alone again, and he was willing to do virtually anything - whether it be telling jokes, playing gags, or creative use of dupes - to get people to notice him.{{citation}}

During a subsequent mission with X-Factor to the island nation of [[Genosha]], one of Madrox's duplicates contracted the deadly [[Legacy Virus]]; when reabsorbed, it was believed Madrox himself was infected. The mutant prophetess [[Radha Dastoor (Earth-616)|Haven]] offered to cure Madrox of the Virus, but the attempt failed and he seemingly died. However, Madrox unconsciously stayed split into separate bodies, ensuring that the Virus would be contained in one body and not duplicate into the others. When the infected body died, the shock of its death caused Madrox to lose his memory. Later, X-Factor was sent on a mission to apprehend a mysterious figure that was revealed to be Madrox, alive and well with his memory restored. Madrox had been recruited by elements of the U.S. government that wanted to turn him into the ultimate secret agent, training him to become a one-man army. Madrox ultimately rejoined X-Factor until the team's disbanding after the apparent death of its leader, Havok. He then returned to Muir Island where he was reunited with both Moira and his X-Factor teammate [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]]. Madrox subsequently worked in Genosha at the behest of Professor X to monitor the situation there after the rise to power of mutant activist [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]].{{citation}}

===X-Corps===
Madrox was then recruited by Banshee into the paramilitary [[X-Corps (Earth-616)|X-Corps]] organization for which Madrox created duplicates to function as support staff performing duties ranging from communications monitoring to gunship pilots.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 401|406}} Following the restructuring of the X-Corps into the X-Corporation global mutant search and rescue organization, Madrox worked with the group's European branch for a time until a pitched battle against the living bacterial consciousness known as [[Zona Cluster-6 (Earth-616)|Weapon XII]] cost the life of his teammate [[Laynia Petrovna (Earth-616)|Darkstar]].{{citation}}

===X-Factor Investigations===
Madrox subsequently quit and struck out on his own. For a long time, Madrox had been unable to decide what to do with his life, and as a solution, had sent out a large number of dupes for the past few years to each live separate lives and then return to him so that he could absorb their knowledge and experiences. Madrox also established [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|XXX Investigators]] in [[Mutant Town]] hiring former X-Factor teammates Strong Guy and Wolfsbane as a bodyguard and assistant respectively. His first case was to investigate the murder of one of his duplicates by an assassin named [[Clay (Earth-616)|Clay]], who also possessed the ability to create duplicates of himself, which led Madrox to [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]] and [[Sheila DeSoto (Earth-616)|Sheila DeSoto]], fiancée of multi-millionaire industrialist [[Edward Vance (Earth-616)|Edward Vance]]. Unbeknownst to Madrox, who had become romantically involved with Sheila, she was the one who had hired Clay to prevent Madrox from interfering in her plans to take control of the Chicago crime syndicate. Sheila was ultimately killed after she was revealed to be a self-styled highly evolved mutant. The firm was renamed '''X-Factor Investigations''' after the [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|government-sponsored X-Factor]] [[Homo superior|mutant]] superhero group that the three founders had previously served on.{{r|{{cl|Madrox Vol 1 1}}-[[Madrox Vol 1 5|5]]}}
 
===Decimation===
Following [[Decimation|M-Day]], Madrox's new-found wealth (from winning a Who Wants to be a Millionaire-style game show) allowed him to recruit two of his former colleagues of the [[Paris (France)|Paris]] branch of the now-defunct [[X-Corporation (Earth-616)|X-Corporation]]: [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] and [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]]'s [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]]. Moreover, the team was then reinforced with the arrival of a depowered [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] and the mysterious, young [[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|Layla Miller]].{{r|{{cl|X-Factor Vol 3 1}}-[[X-Factor Vol 3 4|4]]}}

At this point, Jamie's powers had become defective{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 17}} and he could no longer distinguish his memories from that of his dupes,{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 10}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 13}} like he used to.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 17}} In addition to that, whenever one of his new dupes died, he would inherit his memories, something that was impossible before.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 17}}

[[File:X-Factor Vol 3 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|left|X-Factor Investigations after M-Day]]
Siryn, as part of her duties for X-Factor Investigations, investigated the murder of the [[Rachel Santiago (Earth-616)|woman]] who died in [[Jack Vaughn (Earth-616)|Jack Vaughn]]'s penthouse under suspicious circumstances. Jack Vaughn (a movie star) claimed that the woman had been killed by her sister, [[Gloria Santiago (Earth-616)|Gloria Santiago]], who was upset about the relationship between the two. Rival agency [[Singularity Investigations]] represented Jack Vaughn, with Tryp, Jr. (secretly a young Damien Tryp) as the defense counsel, while X-Factor Investigations tried to help Gloria. After Monet established a mental bond with Gloria to assess the truth, she managed to incriminate Vaughn, while Layla thwarted SI’s assassination attempt on Rictor. Tryp, Jr. was so infuriated by this that he badly beat Siryn and left her for dead (having shot her in the neck with a dart that prevented her from using her powers).{{r|{{cl|X-Factor Vol 3 2}}-[[X-Factor Vol 3 4|4]]}}

Madrox and Strong Guy gave Tryp a very public warning as Tryp was jogging in [[Central Park]]. They told Tryp that they knew that it was him who hurt Siryn, and while they would not hurt him in broad daylight, he should watch his back.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 6}} With this, Tryp, Junior and Tryp, Senior made Madrox an offer to merge X-Factor with their firm, making Madrox laughed in response.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 7}}

After the meeting, Madrox started suspecting Singularity Investigations wasn't responsible for the decimation, as he'd previously thought, so he asked Siryn to find out more about it from the heroes who might have been involved (by using her modulated voice to make them more suggestible). She learned from [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], and later from [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quiksilver]], that the X-Men (who had denied any involvement) were, in fact, central to the ending of the [[House of M]] and the subsequent Decimation. After a confrontation, Madrox decided X-Factor would take a public stance in defiance of the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] and the X-Men decided not to interfere with Quicksilver as long as he stayed in Mutant Town.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 8|9}}

[[File:X-Factor Vol 3 13 Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|right|X-Factor Investigations, with Layla on the team]]
A former Singularity employee went to X-Factor Investigations and revealed that Tryp was attempting to create a modern version of the [[Legacy Virus]]. Strong Guy was sent to drive the man to safety but once they were alone, Strong Guy killed him and called Tryp to report it. Guido tried to tell the team that the man had vanished on him but Wolfsbane smelled his blood on Guido's hands and a psychic scan by Monet revealed the truth. It seemed Tryp had placed a hypnotic suggestion in Strong Guy’s head to turn him into a sleeper agent. After breaking into Singularity Investigations, the elder Tryp confronted the team and revealed that all of Singularity Investigations' efforts to create the new virus had been made to prevent a possible future in which X-Factor managed to undo the Decimation and ended up causing humanity's destruction at the hands of re-powered mutants in a bloody conflict.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 10|12}}

As the team was fleeing the building, [[James Madrox (The X-Factor) (Earth-616)|one of Madrox's dupes]] blew up the whole thing, apparently killing Tryp, Junior and Tryp, Senior. After this, the elder Damian Tryp, who had managed to survive the explosion, revealed to Layla that her very existence had foiled his plans, but things would be different now that he knew of her existence.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 12}}

One night, Madrox got drunk, and a dupe he described as his libido incarnate slept with Siryn and Monet, but, back then, Jamie didn't know if he had slept with one of the women or if the dupe had slept with the two. Regardless, Jamie kept it going with the both of them, afraid of revealing that he was double-timing them. After the confrontation with Singularity Investigations, the members of X-Factor met with [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Doc Samson]], who encouraged Jamie to confess the truth to Monet and Siryn. They did not take it well.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 10}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 13}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 40}}

[[File:John Maddox (Earth-616) from X-Factor Vol 3 16 001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Reverend John Maddox]]
After Madrox's experience with a [[James Madrox (S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent) (Earth-616)|duplicate who was an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]], whose existence he had forgotten about, Madrox decided to go on a quest to gather his lost dupes.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 13}} One of the first dupes he encountered was [[John Maddox (Earth-616)|John Maddox]], who had become a priest and built his own family. He was very determined to keep his individuality and even threatened to shoot Madrox to achieve this goal. However, Jamie won a resulting contest of wills, and John finally submitted to absorption. In the end, Jamie realized the importance of what his dupe had accomplished and decided to let him remain free and live with his family.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 16}}

Jamie met at least one other dupe before returning home. This one had become "the world's greatest detective" and had discovered secrets so important and disturbing that he would rather die than let Jamie live with that knowledge. After killing a corrupt cop in the middle of the street, he was shot by the whole squad accompanying him. Unlike the recently created dupes, this dupe perished with no memories being transferred to Jamie.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 17}}

Meanwhile, Siryn and Monet had bonded in France and rescued an ex-mutant named [[Nicole (Android) (Earth-616)|Nicole]] from a riot.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 16}} When Jamie got home, a group of ex-mutants believing the [[United States Senate (Earth-616)|government]] had depowered mutants was now operating in [[Mutant Town]]. After Quicksilver restored most of the mutants' powers using his [[Terrigen Crystals]], Jamie led a battalion of dupes to face the group, but, in the end, it was their unstable powers that led to their defeat, resulting in the death of one of them and others' retreat. Quicksilver was dealt with by Rictor, who turned against him after he threatened Layla.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 17|20}}

X-Factor tangled with [[Josef Huber (Earth-616)|The Isolationist]], a powerful telepath (among other things), who convinced Madrox, [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], and [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] to organize a "Million Mutant March" political rally on [[Washington, D.C.]] to get mutants declared an endangered species by the [[United States Senate (Earth-616)|U.S. government]]. However, Layla Miller told Madrox that Nicole was one of Huber's agents and had tried to kill her, leading to a confrontation between Huber and the team, which resulted in Madrox, Guido and Rahne being teleported to a frozen wasteland. Luckily, Rictor and Monet fought Huber soon after and forced him to retreat, rescuing the team in the process.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 22|24}}

===Messiah Complex===
[[File:X-Factor Vol 3 25 Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Dupe and Layla going to the future]]
Madrox, Rictor, and an accompanying Layla Miller were alerted to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Mansion]] by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] after the [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|first mutant birth since M-Day]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #492}} Madrox and Layla were sent to [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge's]] [[Eagle Plaza|headquarters]] to send two dupes into different alternate realities. Layla jumped in with one of the dupes at the last minute, claiming she had a part to play in their mission. Unfortunately, Forge informed Madrox that there was no way to retrieve Layla and his dupes, who received instructions to kill themselves once they received the information they needed to get reabsorbed into Madrox Prime.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 25}} Layla and the Madrox-dupe landed in [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop's]] [[Earth-1191|future]], where they were captured and branded as mutants.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 26}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 494}} Layla killed Madrox's dupe, which strangely led to Madrox Prime gaining the same tattoo the dupe had gotten.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 27}}

===The end of Mutant Town===
After a confrontation with Jamie about her leaving, Rahne revealed that she had seen herself murder Jamie and Layla Madrox on their wedding night, and not wanting to kill Layla upon her return from the dystopian future, left the team. Rictor, who'd only been left a letter by Rahne, decided to quit as well, but was kidnapped by the X-Men villain [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] before he had the chance. In addition to that, Arcade also spread several bombs and placed a disintegration grid surrounding Mutant Town, preventing everyone from getting in or out. In the end, X-Factor managed to shut the grid down, but they were unable to save Mutant Town, as it was destroyed by Arcade's bombs.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 28|32}}

[[File:Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616) and James Madrox (Earth-616) from X-Factor Vol 3 32 001.jpg|200px|thumb|left]]
In the aftermath of the event, [[Valerie Cooper (Earth-616)|Val Cooper]] met with the team and tried to recruit them, giving them 24 hours to think about it. Around this time, Madrox also began hallucinating a figure of Layla Miller, who would help him realize things that his subconscious already knew. Thanks to this, Madrox realized what Siryn had been trying to tell him for the last couple of days: she was pregnant with his child. After talking to her about it, the two embraced and discussed the future of the baby and Val Cooper's offer. The whole team then voted, but decided to escape and relocate to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan (State)|Michigan]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 32}}

===Time in Detroit===
Secretly, Val reached Jamie again, and X-Factor started taking cases for the government as well.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 33}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 37}} Theresa found out shortly before giving birth, but she decided to forgive him and proposed to Jamie, who accepted without second thought. When she gave birth, she finally acknowledged that her father was dead decided to name her son Sean, in his honor. As Jamie held his son for the first time, tragedy struck and he absorbed [[Sean Madrox (Earth-616)|Sean]], leaving Theresa in a deep state of sorrow.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 39}}
[[File:James Madrox (Earth-616) and Sean Madrox (Earth-616) from X-Factor Vol 3 39 001.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Jamie's worst nightmare]]

Jamie also didn't deal well with the situation well and left X-Factor Investigations. He walked all the way to [[Vermont (State)|Vermont]] to speak with Pastor John Maddox. After having one final conversation with his dupe, telling him to live for the both of them, he knocked him out and pointed a gun to his own head, planning to end it all right there. An instant before he pulled the trigger, however, an older Layla Miller arrived to stop him.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 40}}

Convinced by Layla, Jamie was transported 80 years into the future. In that time, mutants had risen up against Sentinels and human oppressors and formed the [[Summers Rebellion (Earth-1191)|Summers Rebellion]], led by [[Ruby Summers (Earth-1191)|Ruby Summers]], the daughter of [[Scott Summers (Earth-1191)|Cyclops]] and Emma Frost. After Jamie got reacquainted with Layla, Cyclops tasked them to find out why some mutants were winking out of existence.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 44}} The group visited a senile [[Victor von Doom (Earth-1191)|Doctor Doom]], who revealed he'd met Layla before and was ready to help solve the mystery.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 45}}

[[File:X-Factor Vol 3 41 Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Summers Rebellion]]
However, Doom betrayed the team and brought [[James Madrox (Cortex) (Earth-616)|Cortex]] to this reality to kill all the mutants in the rebellion.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 49}} Cortex was the other dupe who had been sent to the future by Forge and, after getting trapped in a time vortex and experiencing millennia pass, had grown resentful towards Jamie. The initial mystery was also revealed to have been Cortex's attempts to kill the rebellious mutants' ancestors to prevent their births.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 50}}

The Summer's Rebellion was attacked by Cortex and the sudden arrival of a Sentinel army. [[Trevor Fitzroy (Earth-1191)|Trevor Fitzroy]] was killed, but Layla was forced to resurrect him, inevitably turning him into the villain he was destined to be, since she could bring people back, but not their souls. In then, Madrox and Layla were sent back to the present. While Madrox ended up with X-Factor, Layla was nowhere to be seen.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 50}}

===Back in New York===
Jamie took Guido and the two left to open a new branch of X-Factor in New York, allowing Terry to stay in charge in Detroit. This didn't last long though and soon she disbanded X-Factor, forcing the rest of the team to join Jamie and Guido in New York. One of their first mission brought X-Factor to Latveria, where they were reunited with Layla, who had been staying with [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] since her return from the future. This reunion was cut short after Layla intentionally distracted [[Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse)|Shatterstar]] while he was opening one of his portals to behead an evil version of Doom, leaving the two behind in Latveria.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 200|202}}

[[File:X-Factor Vol 1 224.1 Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Reunited in New York]]
After Layla and Shatterstar saved Theresa (now going by Banshee) from [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Trask]]'s [[Mutant Response Division (Earth-616)|MRD]], the trio joined X-Factor at New York. With X-Factor now at full force, they defeated Trask, and Terry and Madrox finally reconciled.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 205|206}}

While protecting [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]], then-mayor of New York, Strong Guy was killed, but Layla brought him back to life using her powers.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 217|218}} This changed the future Layla knew, and, when the demon [[Bloodbath (Earth-616)|Bloodbath]] attacked X-Factor, Jamie was unexpectedly killed, causing Layla great emotional distress.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 227}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 230}}

===They Keep Killing Madrox===
Jamie, however, did not simply die. He appeared in an alternate reality by the corpses of Layla and himself on their wedding night, and confronted [[Vanora (Earth-7153)|Vanora]], who Layla had paid to kill them. Jamie died again (this time hit by a car) and found himself in a reality a [[Steven Rogers (Earth-TRN193)|Deathlok Captain America]]. After dying yet again, he found himself the apprentice of [[Stephen Strange (Earth-TRN196)|Doctor Strange]], who had just died at the hands of [[Dormammu (Earth-TRN196)|Dormammu]]. There, the spirit of Doc Strange was able to help him defeat Dormammu and send Jamie back to his reality, but complications drew Vanora, Deathlok, and Dormammu with him.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 229|232}}

Jamie's body suddenly came back to life in the icebox Layla had kept it in. Overjoyed at his revival, Layla immediately took her clothes off and took their relationship to the next level. Afterwards, Jamie regretted letting that happen and was surprised to learn that [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] and [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] had taken over X-Factor Investigations.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 232|233}} For a while, Jamie and Alex both acted as leaders of X-Factor, but eventually Alex realized that had very different leadership styles and left the team.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 245}}

[[File:Layla Miller (Earth-616) and James Madrox (Earth-616) from X-Factor Vol 1 247 001.jpeg|180px|thumb|left|Wedding]]
After Terry became the new [[Morrigan (Earth-616)|Morrigan]] and left the team, Jamie asked Layla to marry him on a whim{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 245}} and the two traveled to L.A. to make it official.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 247}}

Upon their return, they had to face the [[Hell on Earth War]], during which Jamie was captured by [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] and turned into a demon.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 252|253}} Initially, he didn't appear to have any consciousness or memory of who he was, but after Layla told him she was pregnant with his child, he prayed to Terry, and she cured him of his condition with her new Morrigan powers.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 262}}

===Retirement and Death===
With his curse lifted, Jamie retired to his family farm with Layla and sold the rights of the [[X-Factor]] name to [[Harrison Snow (Earth-928)|Harrison Snow]].{{r|All-New X-Factor Vol 1 1}}

[[File:James Madrox (Earth-616) from Death of X Vol 1 1.JPG|thumb|200px|right]]
Sometime later, Jamie went to Muir Island to investigate what effect the [[Terrigen Mist|Terrigen Mists]] had on mutants. He discovered that the Terrigen Mists were toxic to mutants, but by then, he began to suffer from the lethal effects of the Mists. He sent out a distress call, which was received by Cyclops' [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. The team found Jamie dying among a group of dead or dying dupes. With his last breath, Jamie told Cyclops what he had discovered about the Mists.{{r|Death of X Vol 1 1}}

Jamie along with his dupes and the research team he worked alongside were buried on Muir Island.{{r|Death of X Vol 1 2}}

===Dawn of X===
Jamie was presumably resurrected by the [[Five (Earth-616)|Five]] in [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] and joined the new mutant nation. He was interviewed by [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]] following an ambush of Xavier’s Pharmaceuticals Distribution Site where some of his dupes were in critical condition and reabsorbed for recollecting what had happened.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 4}}

After his return, Jamie no longer possessed the M-shaped tattoo on his face.{{r|Empyre: X-Men Vol 1 1}}

While on Krakoa, Jamie was put in charge of the research labs that produce the Krakoan drugs [[Human Drug M|M]], [[Human Drug I|I]], and [[Human Drug L|L]]. It was while fulfilling this role that he was recruited by his old teammate Monet to join [[X-Corporation (Earth-616)|X-Corp]]'s Board of Directors.{{r|X-Corp Vol 1 1}}

During the launch of the Ionospheric Bandwidth Generator, his wife, Layla asked Jamie to come home to witness his son Davey's first steps. Madrox sent a dupe, planning to reabsorb him and gain his memories, but the dupe died and the memories of Davey's first steps were lost.{{r|X-Corp Vol 1 3}}

| Powers                  = Madrox is a [[Homo Killcrop|Changeling]], the genetic predecessors of [[Homo superior|mutants]] whose [[X-Gene|powers]] manifest at birth instead of during puberty. Madrox's powers include:

[[File:James Madrox (Earth-616) from X-Men Messiah Complex Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Multiple Man in action]]
*'''Kinetic Duplication:''' Jamie Madrox creates identical physical duplicates of himself upon physical impact. This process is spontaneous and cannot be prevented by Madrox. Although he can create multiple duplicates, and the duplicates themselves can also replicate, each is only able to create one duplicate at a time; he used to have an upper limit of 40 dupes, but that is no longer the case.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 200|;Madrox's Handbook Page}} The duplicates think, feel, and act independently, and each tends to manifest one aspect of Madrox's personality.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 1}}
** '''''Duplication Experience Transference:''''' When Madrox merges back, he retains memories, knowledge, and experiences of the dupe. At first, his absorbed memories would feel like "watching TV",{{r|X-Force Vol 1 17}} however, at some point Jamie's powers became defective{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 17}} and he could no longer distinguish his memories from that of his dupes.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 10}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 13}} In addition to that, whenever one of his new dupes died, he would immediately inherit his memories without having to absorb them.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 17}} After coming back to life, it appears he's lost this ability.{{r|X-Corp Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Corp Vol 1 3}}
** '''''Duplication Healing:''''' Absorbing an injured dupe formerly resulted in the prime Madrox suffering an injury half as severe, but he currently suffers no injury whatsoever.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 200|;Madrox's Handbook Page}}

His source paradoxically stated it was the first dupe who denied to re-merge. His difference was shown by incomplete independence on his source duplicate (or it was the fact that this was not the original source) and a [[Mini-Cerebro]] analysis who designed him as different from his source.
*'''[[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]] dupe''' - This dupe lived in Chicago and married [[Sheila DeSoto (Earth-616)|Shelia DeSoto]], crime boss [[Edward Vance (Earth-616)|Edward Vance]]'s fiancée. He was later assassinated by [[Clay (Earth-616)|Clay]].{{r|Madrox Vol 1 1}}

He alone seemed to remember his first encounter with [[Dafydd ap Andras (Earth-6124)|Damian Tryp]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 12}} 
*'''James Madrox Esq.''' - One of Madrox's many dupes went to law school and passed the [[New York (State)|New York]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_exam Bar Exam].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 3}}

*'''"Heff" dupe''' - After celebrating and heavy drinking, Madrox bumped into a wall and created a dupe that later sleeps with [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] and [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]] (or both).{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 11}} Jamie described this dupes as his "libido unleashed".{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 13}} The result of the union was the conception of Sean Madrox. 
*'''[[John Maddox (Earth-616)|Father John Maddox]]''' - John was originally created to learn from the world,{{r|Wolverine: First Class #18}} and went to study religion. While studying he changed his name to ''John Maddox'', married, started a family, and became an Episcopal pastor. Jamie decided not to absorb him because of his family and life.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 16}}
*'''"World's Greatest Detective" dupe''' - After going to [[Detroit]] and [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]] to study investigation, criminal justice, and police work, this dupe became disillusioned with society and the justice system. When Madrox came to reabsorb him, he claimed to have become ''the World's Greatest Detective''. He also claimed to know why Madrox's dupes were becoming more unpredictable, the source of Madrox's powers, "what's coming" and "uber". This knowledge caused him to turn to drinking. Finally, before Madrox could reabsorb this dupe, he shot a dirty cop and was gunned down by the police in order to spare Madrox Prime the burden of knowledge.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 17}}
*'''[[James Madrox (Cortex) (Earth-616)|Cortex]]''' - One of two dupes sent into the only remaining two [[Multiverse|futures]] with [[Homo superior|mutants]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 25}} Cortex encountered Damian Tryp and was altered to served Tryps purposes.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 45}}

*'''[[Sean Madrox (Earth-616)|Sean Madrox]]''' - Sean was actually a child conceived by [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] and a dupe.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 11}} However, as a child of a dupe, Sean possessed the same attributes of a dupe and was inadvertently absorbed by Madrox Prime.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 39}}

*'''Gofer dupe''' - One of Madrox's dupes worked as a gofer on the set of ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_(TV_series) Supernatural]'' for six months, and learned some things about warding off [[demons]].{{r|X-Factor #221}}

Also, he is portrayed in a more comical fashion than many of the other dupes.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 3 8}}
*'''[[James Madrox (Emperor Prime) (Earth-616)|Bunker Dupe]]''' - After the death of Jamie Prime, one dupe managed to survive -- it is unconfirmed if [[James Madrox (Matt Rocks) (Earth-616)|Matt Rocks]] or [[John Maddox (Earth-616)|Father John Maddox]] survived the death of Jamie Prime, but seems unlikely based off of the nature of Jamie's powers established in [[Multiple Man Vol 1|''Multiple Man'']] -- by having sealed himself in an airtight bunker on [[Muir Island]] sometime before the events of [[Madrox Vol 1|''Madrox'']] and the following [[X-Factor Vol 3|''X-Factor'']], which delayed the adverse health effects of Jamie Prime's death. In an effort to put off his inevitable death, the dupe stole a [[Temporal Beacon]] from [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] and traveled into the future, creating dupes along the way that resulted in a future which was ruled and policed by Madri.{{r|{{cl|Multiple Man Vol 1 1}}-[[Multiple Man Vol 1 2|2]]}} This dupe was revealed to have personified a treacherous, megalomaniacal aspect of Jamie Prime's personality and had originally locked himself in the bunker in order to find a way to become the Prime Jamie.{{r|Multiple Man Vol 1 3}} Dubbing himself "Emperor Prime," he was the leader of a totalitarian regime in the future he had conquered, though he was opposed by a Resistance also made up of Madri, led by that reality's Jamie Prime's orphaned son, Davey Miller.{{r|Multiple Man Vol 1 2}} The Emperor Prime had killed off most of the world's superheroes, starting with Beast after he had created a serum that would make the Emperor Prime the Prime Jamie.{{r|Multiple Man Vol 1 3}} The Emperor Prime ended up undergoing a change of heart after killing a heroic version of himself who had traveled to the past to stop him, thus becoming said heroic version himself.{{r|{{cl|Multiple Man Vol 1 3}}-[[Multiple Man Vol 1 4|4]]}} This Madrox ultimately managed to fix the timeline by committing assisted suicide that created a chain reaction, killing all of the army of duplicates, good and bad, except for [[James Madrox (Bartender) (Earth-616)|one]] that was in a different reality at the time.{{r|Multiple Man Vol 1 5}} Other notable Dupes from this time travel adventure include:
**'''[[James Madrox (Lieutenant) (Earth-616)|Lieutenant Madrox]]''' - Emperor Prime's second-in-command who, after the Emperor Prime's change of heart, took over control of the empire and used its army to invade the [[Earth-616|past]], defeating the combined forces of the heroic Emperor, the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], and the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]]. Lieutenant Madrox managed to steal and take the serum that turned the Emperor Prime into the Prime Jamie, briefly managing to become "Co-Prime," but was then reabsorbed by the Emperor.{{r|{{cl|Multiple Man Vol 1 4}}-[[Multiple Man Vol 1 5|5]]}}

Stark refused to assist Jamie's time but did take him on as a student. After sixty years of study, Jamie, taking the name and [[Cloak's Cloak|Cloak]] of [[Earth-TRN591|that world's]] deceased [[Tyrone Johnson|Cloak]], collected the other dupes that had been sent into the timestream and traveled back to assist [[James Madrox (Emperor Prime) (Earth-616)|Jamie Prime]] in saving their world.{{r|Multiple Man Vol 1 4}} Cloak ultimately died when [[James Madrox (Emperor Prime) (Earth-616)|Jamie Prime]] was killed, saving the [[Earth-616|Past]].{{r|Multiple Man Vol 1 5}}
**'''[[James Madrox (Hulk) (Earth-616)|Hulk]]''' - One of a group of dupes from the Resistance against [[James Madrox (Emperor Prime) (Earth-616)|Emperor Prime]] who were sent into the timestream to find help. This dupe ended up on [[Earth-807128]] and became a [[Hulk]] after drinking Gamma-irradiated water. He joined the [[Hulk Gang (Earth-807128)|Hulk Gang]] for a while before [[James Madrox (Cloak) (Earth-616)|Cloak]] returned to collect him.{{r|Multiple Man Vol 1 4}} Hulk assisted [[James Madrox (Emperor Prime) (Earth-616)|Jamie Prime]] in killing himself in order to stop the invading evil [[Multiple Man|Multiple Men]], and died himself as a result.{{r|Multiple Man Vol 1 5}}
**'''[[James Madrox (Deadpool) (Earth-616)|Deadpool]]''' - One of a group of dupes from the Resistance against [[James Madrox (Emperor Prime) (Earth-616)|Emperor Prime]] who were sent into the timestream to find help.

The dupe ended up committing to the Clan's cause and spent years helping to fight back against [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-4935)|Apocalypse]], becoming bonded with the [[Technarchy]] at some point. He was collected, unwillingly, by [[James Madrox (Cloak) (Earth-616)|Cloak]] to travel back to save their time.{{r|Multiple Man Vol 1 4}}. Cable ultimately died when [[James Madrox (Emperor Prime) (Earth-616)|Jamie Prime]] was killed, saving the [[Earth-616|Past]].{{r|Multiple Man Vol 1 5}}
**'''[[James Madrox (Bartender) (Earth-616)|Bartender Dupe]]''' - One of a group of dupes from the Resistance against [[James Madrox (Emperor Prime) (Earth-616)|Emperor Prime]] who were sent into the timestream to find help, this dupe was specifically sent to find [[Tony Stark]]. This dupe ended up on an [[Marvel Swimsuit Special Vol 1|Earth where everyone hangs out on a beach wearing swimsuits]] and got a job as a bartender. The dupe was forgotten and ended up not being collected by [[James Madrox (Cloak) (Earth-616)|Cloak]] with the rest. He returned to [[Earth-616|the past]] after the death of [[James Madrox (Emperor Prime) (Earth-616)|Jamie Prime]], somehow having survived (Likely due to not being on [[Earth-616]] at the time), leaving his new world after it "took a turn for the worst" and wearing an M tattoo over his eye identical to that which the original Jamie had received on [[Earth-1191]]. This dupe then took the serum [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] had created, making him the new and only Jamie Prime, and set out to meet the original Madrox's widowed [[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|wife]] and [[Davey Miller (Earth-616)|child]].{{r|Multiple Man Vol 1 4}}{{r|Multiple Man Vol 1 5}}
