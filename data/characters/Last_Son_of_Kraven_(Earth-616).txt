===Early Life===
After [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]]'s botched resurrection at the hands of his wife and children, he and his daughter [[Anastasia Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Ana Kravinoff]] hunted and killed the other members of their family - [[Vladimir Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Vladimir]], [[Alexei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Alyosha]] and [[Aleksandra Nikolaevna (Earth-616)|Sasha Kravinoff]]. Following this, Sergei attempted to break the curse of immortality placed on him by his resurrection, though this proved unsuccessful.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 23}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 17}} 

[[File:Last Son of Kraven (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 16 001.png|thumb|left|Last Son of Kraven]]

Dissatisfied with only having a daughter to carry on his legacy, Sergei travelled to [[Wundagore Mountain]] and forced the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] to create eighty-seven clones of himself. Sergei took his "sons" to the [[Savage Land]] and trained them in the ways of the hunt until he deemed them ready, sending them out into the world with the task of proving themselves worthy of his legacy. Deeming his brethren to be weak and unworthy, one of the Sons of Kraven hunted and killed each of his "brothers" before returning to the Savage Land and giving their skulls to Kraven, who was overcome with pride at his Last Son's ruthlessness and named him his heir.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 16}} 

===The Great Hunt===
Kraven sent the Last Son to subdue [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] as part of [[Hunted (Spider-Man Story Arc)|an elaborate plan]] to goad his longtime enemy into killing him and breaking his curse of immortality.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 17}} As Kraven and his Last Son watched the Hunter robots battle the assembled animal-themed supervillains and heroes, the Son was outraged that his father didn't want him and his son hunting the prey themselves.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 18|19}} Dismissing his "father" as a pathetic shadow of his former self, the Last Son set out to join the hunt, attacking and defeating the [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Lizard]]. 

Upon seeing that Curt Connors had suppressed the Lizard, the Last Son dismissed him as being just as pathetic as Kraven, promising to kill the Lizard's son [[William Connors (Earth-616)|Billy]] right in front of him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 20}} The Last Son attempted to kill the [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] and Billy but he was driven off by the Lizard. Returning to Kraven's manor and finding Spider-Man, the Last Son brutally pummeled him before strangling him to death, only to remove his mask and discover he had just killed Kraven himself, who had assumed Spider-Man's mantle and willingly let the Last Son kill him as part of a ploy to break his curse.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 22}} After attending his father's funeral, the Last Son found a letter left behind by his father, in which Kraven bequeathed him his legacy, not only as his son but as Sergei Kravinoff himself, since he was a clone, thus taking up the mantle of Kraven the Hunter.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 23}}

Wanting to go to hunt a worthy prey, Kraven targeted [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], the King of the Monsters, and his monsters.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 1}} He killed a few dozen of them and eventually ambushed Deadpool, but before he could attempt to kill Deadpool, [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]] shot Deadpool with a bullet that teleported him to a pocket dimension.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 2}} After Deadpool returned and sent all of his Honor Guards to a safe place, Kraven and Deadpool fought again -- with Kraven eventually getting the upper hand.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 3}} Deadpool was able to injure Kraven and reunited with his guards. With their combined effort, they were able to defeat Kraven who was then transported to [[Alaska]] by a [[Soul-Eaters|Soul-Eater]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 4}}

===Sinister War===
Kraven retreated to the Savage Land, where he was found by [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]]. Under the control of [[Sarah Stacy (Earth-616)|Kindred]], Octavius was rebuiling the [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Six]], and he convinced Kraven to join him in exchange for the chance to hunt the Lizard, who was Octavius' next recruit.{{r|Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: Chameleon Conspiracy Vol 1 1}} The team broke into Curt Connors' lab and they managed to separate the scientist's Lizard side into a [[Lizard (Isotope Genome Accelerator Duplicate) (Earth-616)|separate entity]] with the [[Isotope Genome Accelerator]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 70}}

Continuing Kindred's plans, the Sinister Six recruited [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]] at the premiere of his film. The team briefly clashed with the [[Savage Six (Kraven's) (Earth-616)|Savage Six]], who wanted revenge on Mysterio.{{r|Sinister War Vol 1 1}} After Spider-Man was delivered to Kindred by the Sinister Six, the villain forced the team to participate in a battle royale against other teams of Spider-Man's foes for the hero's head.{{r|Sinister War Vol 1 2}} The villains were forced into the contest by Kindred lodging deadly centipedes into their brains, but they were ultimately freed from Kindred's grasp after Doctor Octopus cobbled together a device which killed the insects.{{r|Sinister War Vol 1 4}}
