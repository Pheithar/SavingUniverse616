===Origins===
'''Charlie-27''' was a soldier and space militia pilot, genetically engineered to live in [[Jupiter (Planet)|Jupiter]]'s gravity, born in Galileo City, Jupiter. As such, he had eleven times the muscle mass of a normal human. He was also a Captain in the [[United Lands of Earth Space Militia (Earth-691)|United Lands of Earth Space Militia]].

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
In 3007 A.D., the alien [[Badoon]] invaded the solar system, performing various acts of genocide. Charlie was the only survivor of his world due to being on a long-term space mission. He joined forces with [[Martinex T'Naga (Earth-691)|Martinex]], [[Yondu Udonta (Earth-691)|Yondu]], and [[Vance Astro (Earth-691)|Vance Astro]] to form the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-691)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], a band of freedom fighters.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes #18}} In 3014 A.D., he teamed with the time-traveling [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]], [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], and [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]] to retake [[New York City]] from Badoon forces.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #5}} He later time-traveled to the 20th Century, and met the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]].{{r|Giant-Size Defenders #5}} He returned to 3015 A.D. with [[Stakar Ogord (Earth-691)|Starhawk]] and the Defenders to defeat a Badoon invasion force.{{r|Defenders #26}}

After the final defeat of the Badoon, Charlie-27 found himself unable to fit in with postwar civilian life. He departed Earth on a space mission with his fellow teammates{{r|Marvel Presents #3}} and met [[Nicholette Gold (Earth-691)|Nikki]], who joined the Guardians of the Galaxy.{{r|Marvel Presents #4}} He then visited the [[Asylum (Planet)|Asylum]] planet.{{r|Marvel Presents #5}} Charlie helped defeat the [[Topographical Man (Earth-691)|Topographical Man]]{{r|Marvel Presents #6|7}} and was present when the Guardians learned how the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-691)|Silver Surfer]] repulsed the original Badoon invasion attempt of Earth in the 20th Century.{{r|Marvel Presents #8}} He met [[Aleta Ogord (Earth-691)|Aleta]] and learned the origin of Starhawk.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 29}} He battled the [[Reavers of Arcturus (Earth-691)|Reavers of Arcturus]].{{r|Marvel Presents Vol 1 9}} Charlie then discovered the space station [[Drydock]], which the Guardians used as a base of operations for a time.{{r|Marvel Presents Vol 1 12}}

===Time Travel===
Charlie later teamed with the time-traveling [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] to battle [[Michael Korvac (Earth-691)|Korvac]] and his [[Minions of Menace (Earth-691)|Minions]].{{r|Thor Annual Vol 1 6}} With the Guardians of the Galaxy, Charlie-27 traveled to the present, in pursuit of Korvac.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 167}} He met the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], and saved the life of a young [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Vance Astrovik]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 170}} Charlie assisted the Avengers in battling Korvac.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 173|177}} He attended an Avengers membership meeting, but wound up parting company with the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 181}} Charlie attempted to prevent the meeting of Vance Astro's 20th and 31st Century selves, and battled the Thing to do so.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One Vol 1 69}} With the Guardians, he then returned to the 31st Century.

===Return to the 31st Century===
Charlie and the Guardians then went on a quest to find the lost shield of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-691)|Captain America]]. He battled [[Taserface (Earth-691)|Taserface]] and the [[Stark (Race)|Stark]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 1}} He encountered [[Pyreus Kril (Earth-691)|Firelord]] and defeated the Stark.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 2}} He battled the superhuman team known as [[Force (Earth-691)|Force]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 3|6}} He encountered [[Malevolence (Earth-691)|Malevolence]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 7}} He located [[Haven (Planet)|Haven]], a lost colony of Earth founded by mutants.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 8}} He battled [[Rancor (Earth-691)|Rancor]] and her [[Nine (Earth-691)|Lieutenants]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 9|11}}

Charlie once had a romantic relationship with fellow Guardian Nikki, but the two broke it off. They still remained friends.{{Citation}}

Though from the future, Charlie-27 managed to become involved in the [[Infinity War]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 27}} He and his team saved [[Avengers Mansion]] from an invasion by the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 28}} Then both teams saved each other from waves of evil doubles based on their teams.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 29}}

[[Rita DeMara (Earth-616)|Rita DeMara]] once earned his friendship by performing an impromptu surgery with her stings on a massive internal blood-clot, saving his life.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy #34}}

As with the rest of the team, Charlie's last appearance was on a mysterious planet as the team had become lost in space and time.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy #62}} 

| Powers                  = Due to his Jovian ancestry, Charlie-27 is 11 times stronger and 11 times denser than a normal human being:
*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Initially his strength was placed in the 2-5 ton range. Later Charlie was severely injured, and his physiology was optimized as a result, his strength increased to the 5-10 ton range. 
*'''Superhuman Stamina:''' His endurance is also much higher than a normal human being; it is estimated that he can push himself for a number of hours at peak efficiency before tiring. 
*'''Superhuman Durability:''' His skin is incredibly dense, and is about as hard as 20th century Earth bullet-proof glass.

| Abilities               = Charlie is a brilliant military man, and a combat specialist. He's well versed in using his strength to his advantage in combat, including using grapples and using starship cannons as hand held ranged weapons. He's an exceptional field commander and has a knack for seeing through his enemies strategies.
| Strength                = At first his strength was in the 2-5 ton range. Later it ranged between 5-10 tons.
| Weaknesses              = Charlie a very militaristic man, and this has been used against him in the past. In the trial of Mainframe, he failed because he fell into Military dogma rather than coping with the situation at hand. During the Guardian's failed invasion of the Badoon, his military sense of honor made him fight nearly to death against the Captain Universe force.

| Equipment               = Charlie generally has his Guardian's Communication/Teleportation star on him at all times. 
| Transportation          = See [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-691)]]
| Weapons                 = He also goes almost nowhere without a ranged weapon, and he is never without Yondu's Yaka Dagger which was given to him as a gift. Varies with the situation.
