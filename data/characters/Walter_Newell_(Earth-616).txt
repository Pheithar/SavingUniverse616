| History                 = ===Origins===
Dr. Walter Newell was a brilliant oceanographer and engineer. He supervised the construction of a domed undersea city with plans to grow food for mankind. The city was attacked by the [[Parnival Plunder (Earth-616)|Plunderer]], but he was stopped by the  [[Homo mermanus|Atlanteans]] [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor, the Sub-Mariner]] and [[Dorma (Earth-616)|Lady Dorma]], but the city was destroyed.{{r|Tales to Astonish #95}} [[Todd Arliss (Earth-616)|Tiger Shark]] attempted to unleash a deadly virus, but Namor - with the help of Newell - ensured that it caused no harm. Unfortunately, Tiger Shark escaped.{{r|Sub-Mariner #16}}

[[File:Walter Newell (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 24 001.jpg|left|thumb|Stingray]]

He designed a [[Stingray's Suit|unique suit for deep sea exploration]]. He took the name Stingray after basing some of its design on manta rays. He was ordered by [[Edgar Benton (Earth-616)|Edgar Benton]] to bring [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] in to investigate the disappearance of water from Earth's oceans. Stingray reluctantly did so, but later allowed Namor to leave. It was during this time that he met his future wife, [[Diane Arliss (Earth-616)|Diane Arliss]], the sister of [[Todd Arliss (Earth-616)|Tiger Shark]] and the two started dating.{{r|Sub-Mariner #19}} He helped Namor with various crises.{{r|Sub-Mariner #26|47}}

[[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Dr. Bruce Banner]] was picked up by the ship ''[[Lady Diana]]'', which was captained by Newell.

Hulk was about to kill him, but [[James Wilson (Earth-616)|Jim Wilson]] got in the way, saving Stingray's life, and Hulk leapt away.{{r|Incredible Hulk #221}}

===Defenders for a Day===
When [[Aaron English (Earth-616)|Dollar Bill]] aired a documentary about the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] without their knowledge, claiming that "Anyone can be a Defender!", Stingray was one of nearly two dozen heroes who showed up for the unauthorized membership drive. These "[[Defenders for a Day (Earth-616)|Defenders for a Day]]" ended up helping the Defenders against two groups of super-villains who also tried to cash in on the Defenders' name and create confusion.{{r|Defenders #62|64}}

===Hydro-Base===
He and his wife became the caretakers of [[Hydrobase]] and offered the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] use of the facilities.

Newell and his wife, Diana, met up with the Avengers to show off their Hydrobase in hopes of having the Avengers rent the island.{{r|Avengers #262}}

After Avengers Mansion was critically damaged by battle with the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]], the Avengers moved to Hydrobase for their primary headquarters.{{r|Avengers #278}} As their landlord, Stingray occasionally operated as an on-site associate of the team. He was involved in the defense of Hydrobase when [[Heavy Metal (Earth-616)|Heavy Metal]] led by the [[Super-Adaptoid (Earth-616)|Super-Adaptoid]] attacked.{{r|Avengers #289|290}}

===Avengers===
When the Avengers first reformed after [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], Stingray responded to the mass rallying call to oppose the threat of [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]]. Like most of those responding, however, he chose not to remain with the group full time.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 #1|4}}

Stingray later became a fully active member of the Avengers roster for the first time when [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]] began striking around the globe. Stingray's nautical experience helped on the waterfront during Kang's war, when the rogue Atlanteans under [[Attuma (Earth-616)|Attuma]] lent their swords to his.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 #43|55}} Even though he ultimately left the team, Stingray remained a reserve member and would respond to emergency calls.{{r|Avengers #501|503}}

===Fear Itself===
In a battle against Nerkkod (Attuma), [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] brought a small army of "Defenders, [[Secret Defenders (Earth-616)|Secret Defenders]], even those who were only Defenders for a Day such as Stingray," summoned by a spell [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] conjured in [[New Atlantis (Atlantean Pillar)|New Atlantis]]. The added numbers quickly turn the tide of battle, assisted by another spell from Strange which clouded the army's transparent face-shields.{{r|Fear Itself: The Deep #4}}

After condensing a portion of Scarlet Witch's powers into the device, Valeria informed the heroes their job was done.{{r|Avengers World #16}}
