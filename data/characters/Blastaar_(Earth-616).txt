| History                 = '''Blastaar''' once ruled the planet [[Baluur]] in the [[Negative Zone]]. The inhabitants revolted and set him adrift in space, there he came across [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]], who was returning to Earth with the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Triton (Earth-616)|Triton]], and he followed them through a portal{{r|Fantastic Four #62}}. He teamed up with [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]], but the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] and [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]] managed to defeat them and send Blastaar back to his own dimension.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 62}} 

Blastaar became king of Baluur again and expanded his territory significantly. When his empire made contact with [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]]', they became rivals. Blastaar took Annihilus's [[Cosmic Control Rod]], thus upsetting the balance of power, but the FF forced him to relinquish it.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One Vol 1 75}}

After another conflict, Blastaar was left adrift in the Negative Zone until he came across [[Olympia]], home of the [[Eternals]] temporarily displaced into the Zone. When he recovered, Blastaar attacked and atomized the Eternals, his concussive shock blasts destabilizing their molecular control. The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] arrived searching for the Eternals, and Blastaar was eventually defeated. Despite the initial surprise caused by their dispersal, the Eternals reasserted control over their molecules and reintegrated, undoing Blastaar's disintegration.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 309|310}}

Blastaar found himself on Earth again when a team of scientists opened a portal to study the Negative Zone. A group of young heroes known as the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]] kept him at bay and, using a map of the Zone that Blastaar was holding, stranded him on an uninhabited planet in the Negative Zone.{{r|New Warriors Vol 2 1}}

===Annihilation===
Blastaar was seen with the Spaceknights, aiding [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]]'s attempt to assassinate Annihilus.{{r|Annihilation Vol 1 5}}

Following the aftermath of Annihilation, Blastaar is seen leading a group of [[Kree]] soldiers against the [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]], who have reaped the benefit of Annihilus' war by assimilating the remainders of the weaken alien races including the Kree, but the group is defeated and Blastaar is captured. The Phalanx interrogates Blastaar, and continue to torture him until he apparently dies when he doesn't say a word. This death appears to be simply a hibernation that Blastaar can reverse, which he has used to fool the Phalanx temporarily. Unfortunately, Blastaar became infected with the transmode virus and was made into a [[Selects (Earth-616)|Select]]. His first mission was to stop [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] and his team from crippling the Babel Spire that was powering the galaxy-wide forcefield that isolated the Kree. He killed the former [[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]] before subduing Star-Lord for interrogation by [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]] personally.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 1|4}}

===War of Kings===
Blastaar later became king of the Negative Zone.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 #7}} He and his forces seize control of [[Wonderland|42]], the Negative Zone Prison, and recruit a number of the imprisoned Earth superhumans there into his army. Later he is approached by the Raptors [[Shir Ydrn Talonis (Earth-616)|Talon]] and [[Razor (Raptor) (Earth-616)|Razor]], who offer Blastaar the Cosmic Control Rod they took from [[Catastrophus (Earth-616)|Catastrophus]], in exchange for his assistance in influencing the outcome of the War between the [[Shi'ar]] and the Inhumans. While launching an attack to capture and kill Ravenous, Blastaar encountered Nova, who was on a rescue mission to save his brother. Though Blastaar threatened Nova when he tried to provide protection to Ravenous and take Blastaar's ally Strontian as a prisoner of the Nova Corps, Nova silently reminded Blastaar what happened to the last person to threaten him with the Cosmic Control Rod and Blastaar yielded.{{r|Nova Vol 4 27|28}}

===Realm of Kings===
[[File:Blastaar (Earth-616) from Spider-Man-Deadpool Vol 1 43 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]
Following the Inhuman-led Kree/Vulcan-led Shi'ar war, Blastaar, in his position as king, became a member of a new Galactic Council (replacing the one slaughtered by [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]]). Attending the group's first meeting, he came under attack by giant insect-shaped nanotech weapons, seeing it as proving how important he was. After the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] helped fight the weapons off, he complained about their presence, and wanted them gone from the gathering, though [[Groot (Earth-616)|Groot]]'s royal status allowed them to remain.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 24}}

===Thanos Imperative===
Though he aided the other races in their fight for survival against the [[Earth-10011|Cancerverse]] invasion, Blastaar launched an attack on the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]], trying to make a power grab while the Kree and Inhumans were still recovering from their losses. His attempt to assassinate Queen Medusa was quickly thwarted by the newly formed Annihilators.{{r|Thanos Imperative: Devastation Vol 1 1}}

===End to the Beginning===
After a scuffle as part of the [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]] against the [[Future Foundation (Earth-616)|Future Foundation]] lead by [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]],{{r|FF Vol 2 7}} Blastaar ended up at the end of the universe. He later got sent to the big bang as a form of execution{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 4 6}} by the government at the end of the universe for his crimes there.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 4 7}}

===Return===
Blastaar eventually returned to the present through unknown means and got into a scuffle with [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]]. She defeated him and was taking him into custody when she was mentally transported to different realities by the [[Reality Stone]], allowing Blastaar to get free. When Marvel mentally returned to her native reality, she knocked out Blastaar by overloading him with energy and took him back into custody.{{r|Infinity Countdown: Captain Marvel Vol 1 1}}

'''Superhuman Speed:''' Blastaar is capable of running and moving at speeds greater than even the finest human athlete.{{Citation}}

'''Superhuman Durability:''' Blastaar's body is highly resistant to all forms of physical injury. He is capable of withstanding the impact of .30 caliber, armor piercing machine gun shells, temperature extremes from as low as -200 degrees Farenheit to as high as 11,000 degrees Fahrenheit, falls from tremendous heights, great impact forces, and powerful energy beams without sustaining injury. Blastaar is also capable of surviving for weeks at a time without food or water. He can also survive in an airless vacuum for several months at a time by willing himself into a state of suspended animation.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 2}}

'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Blastaar's reaction time is enhanced to a level that is beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.{{Citation}}

'''Force Blasts:''' Blastaar can generate concussive blasts, presumably by some biological means, and direct them through his fingers. These blasts have a range of 1,000 feet and can penetrate 6-inch titanium-plated steel.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 2}}

*'''Flight:''' Blastaar is capable of using this same energy to propel himself at tremendous speeds. He is able to fly at a top speed of approximately 25,000 mph.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 2}}

He was stated to have an "Universal" threat level by the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]], and that if he was to enter the positive universe, he would be categorized as a ''"Category 1 criminal"''.{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files #1}}
