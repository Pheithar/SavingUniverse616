===Early Life===
Born with the ability to master any skill quickly, her parents rewarded her for any activity that brought them money, status or acclaim. She is aware her parents had a shadowy past, and suspects that her real father might be the [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]], but has no proof beyond a similarity in their abilities.{{r|Avengers Academy #9}}

She graduated [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] at age fourteen and was in training to become an Olympic athlete when she was approached to join the Avenger's program. She welcomed the chance to expand her knowledge, and because her rivals were attempting to have her banned anyway. While the other members of the Avengers Academy were tortured by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] to expand their powers, she never was. All he had to do was offer her the chance to learn things she never could otherwise. For this, her new instructors regard her with suspicion.{{r|Avengers Academy #1}}

===Avengers Academy=== 
Following Norman Osborn's removal from power following [[Siege (Event)|Siege]], the Avengers Academy was handed over to [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]] who took it upon himself to undo Osborn's cruel tutelage and encourage the students to be happier, better heroes.{{r|Avengers Academy #1}}

Jeanne was consequently recruited to join the newly formed [[Avengers Academy]] alongside other young potential heroes [[Ken Mack (Earth-616)|Mettle (Ken Mack)]], [[Brandon Sharpe (Earth-616)|Striker (Brandon Sharpe)]], [[Madeline Berry (Earth-616)|Veil (Madeline Berry)]], [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-616)|Reptil (Humberto Lopez)]], and [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat (Jennifer Takeda)]]. She and the rest of the class were led to believe they were among those most likely to become heroes, but they quickly uncovered files on them revealed they were most likely to become villains.{{r|Avengers Academy #1}}

[[File:Jeanne Foucalt (Earth-616) from Avengers Academy Vol 1 33.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Finesse as a member of Avengers Academy]]
After viewing a documentary on [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]]'s life, she guessed that he was never replaced by a [[Skrull]] like he claimed to the media, and used this knowledge to blackmail him into teaching her everything he learned as part of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].{{r|Avengers Academy #2}} She grew close to Quicksilver and was quick to defend him after [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] payed a visit to the academy (in the course of an inquiry into [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]]'s murder) and argued with his son.{{r|Avengers Academy #22}}

Whilst successful for the most part, Jeanne continued to behave in very much the same way, pursuing knowledge and physical prowess over human interaction, thus alienating herself from the others who came to view her as cold. When [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] joined the academy the two girls found they shared a similar disposition and emotionless rationale, regarded as outcasts, but still trying to determine their own identities they became friends.{{r|Avengers Academy #29|30}}

During the [[Avengers vs. X-Men]] conflict, when a [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]]-[[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|empowered]] [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] came to the academy to destroy [[Juston Seyfert (Earth-616)|Juston]]'s [[Justin's Sentinel (Earth-616)|Sentinel]], Jeanne and Laura stood up to her and defended the other students.{{r|Avengers Academy #32|33}}

===Final Exam===
After Hazmat received a call from [[Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616)|Briggs]] saying he had found a cure to her and Mettle's condition, both of them came to Briggs', joined by Lightspeed, Striker, Finesse and X-23. Veil revealed to the students that she had been cured by Alchemist's new invention "Clean Slate". Mettle and Hazmat took the cure, and than Jeremy revealed his true intentions: to wipe every superhumans powers off the planet and to repower only the people who would use it properly. Jocasta tried to stop him, but Briggs switched her body to a locked office. After defeating the depowered Reptil, White Tiger, Lightspeed, Finesse, and X-23, Briggs extended his offer to Mettle, Hazmat, Striker, and Veil who accepted it.{{r|Avengers Academy #34}}

Jeremy Briggs however revealed his true plan was to Veil and Striker. He plans to remove all superpowered beings powers only allowing the worthy to possess them.<!-- Same as up here --> Veil ran to tell Mettle and Hazmat and persuaded them to take the so called antidote and restored their powers for good. Mettle and the group confronted Jeremy and his accomplice, the [[Sylvie Lushton (Earth-616)|Enchantress (Sylvie Lushton)]], on the rooftop of the building.{{r|Avengers Academy #35}} 

[[Ava Ayala (Earth-616)|White Tiger]] and Reptil draw on the full power of their magic, gain an extreme upper hand on the Enchantress. Sensing her defeat, she teleported away but not before getting her face slashed by White Tiger.{{r|Avengers Academy #36}} X-23 did some slicing and dicing of Briggs, so released an acid attack on her stomach, destroying it in the process. Finesse noticed this as the perfect opportunity to use X-23's hands as weapons. Finesse grabbed her wrists, and stabbed two of Briggs' most important arteries. As he sat there bleeding to death, he freaked out, and Finesse started to stop the loss of blood by cutting off the flow. Finesse reminded Briggs about why they were recruited, that they were at risk of being villains. As she said this, she untied the cloth that has been keeping Briggs from bleeding to death, and walked off as he died.{{r|Avengers Academy #37}} 

When the students graduated, Finesse immediately hit the databanks to test out her new security clearance, loading beta files.{{r|Avengers Academy #39}}

===Avengers Arena===
It was revealed that Finesse went to her parents during Christmas and thus was not [[Avengers Arena Vol 1|abducted]] by [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]].{{r|Avengers Arena #1}}

Finesse appeared again when Pym became suspicious about the number of missing super-teens who left from their various schools and superhero lives.{{r|Avengers Arena #13}}

===Infinity===

Finesse and Striker were chosen to represent Avengers Academy against the other superhero schools in the Contest of Champions. They were in attendance at the introductory ceremony when it was interrupted by [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos']] invasion.{{r|Infinity: The Hunt #1}}

She was among the young heroes who assembled in Central Park to fight [[Mother (Interdimensional Parasite) (Earth-TRN287)|Mother]]'s army of evil other dimensional Young Avengers.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #11}}

===A.I.M.===

After not being seen for a while, she eventually joined A.I.M.,{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 2 #3}} and fought against [[Nadia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Nadia van Dyne]] and her G.I.R.L. organisation a couple of times. But when A.I.M. leader [[Monica Rappaccini (Earth-616)|Monica Rappaccini]] abandoned her and fellow A.I.M. recruits Seeker and Brilliance, the trio decided to defect, and were recruited into G.I.R.L. Jeanne was last seen training [[Priya Aggarwal (Earth-616)|Priya Aggarwal]], who gained superpowers and needed to learn how to defend herself.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 2 #10}}
