The Celestials visit planets—in what is known as Celestial Hosts—to experiment on, and judge, lower life-forms. They create [[Eternals]] and [[Deviants]] from selected species. For [[Earth]], the [[Glossary:First Host|First Host]] created [[Eternals (Homo immortalis)|''Homo immortalis'']] and [[Deviants (Homo descendus)|''Homo descendus'']], and inserted a [[Mutant Biology|latent gene]] into baseline humanity that causes mutations.{{r|What If?

In addition, [[Progenitor (Celestial) (Earth-616)|one Celestial]] came to Earth 4 billion years before the other Celestials and died. Its body fluids spilled into the planet, changing it forevermore. According to [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]], it is because of this "giant cosmic accident" that Earth is so unique among all the planets in the universe for being such a hotbed for super-powered madness.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 5}}

===Origin===
====First Firmament====
In the beginning, there was only one universe, the [[First Firmament (First Cosmos)|First Firmament]], perfect but alone. This sentient universe decided to create life: Celestial servants. Some of these servants industriously worshipped the First Firmament, seeking its approval whenever they created life on their own, which prompted the First Firmament to name them "[[Aspirants]]"; others, "multicolored rebels",{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 6}} who were "as many as the stars themselves",{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 13}} wanted their own creations to evolve, and wanted the universe to grow, change and die. That was seen by the First Firmament as madness and sacrilege.{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 6}}

====[[Celestial War]]====
War eventually broke out between the "multicolored rebels", later known as simply "Celestials", and the Aspirants{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 6}} for the dominion of all existence.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 13}}

{{MessageBox

}}

[[File:Celestial War from Ultimates 2 Vol 2 6 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Celestial War]]
The war greatly diminished both groups. Eventually the rebellious Celestials resorted in desperation to using powerful weapons to eliminate their opponents, including the Aspirants' [[Godkiller Armor]], which the Celestials used to win the final battle of the war.

After a decisive battle in the Celestial War, there was a lull in fighting between the two groups. During this time, the Aspirants fortified their fleets and immediately entered into aggressive squabbles among themselves, which gave the opposing Celestials time to recover and to plot ways to finish crushing their opponents.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 13}} <!-- This information, however, comes only from a centuries old malfunctioning [[Rigellian Recorders|Rigellian Recorder]] android that, besides exhibiting genocidal opinions (and acts) exhibited more than a few historical "opinions" that it repeatedly stated as fact even though they were incorrect.{{citation}} -->

The Celestial War ultimately ended when the rebel Celestials shattered the First Firmament into pieces. The rebellious Celestials detonated their weapons, and hundreds of new universes were split off from the First Firmament. The First Firmament fled along with the remaining Aspirants, and the new universes formed a collective entity called the [[Second Cosmos]] (which was the first [[Multiverse]]).{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 6}}

===Ancient interactions===
====Colonization of the Second Cosmos====
The [[Second Cosmos]] (or Second Infinity) was colonized by the rebel Celestials. These Celestials evolved their own servitors whom they came to call "[[Omega (Race)|Omegas]]", a name given to them to signal opposition to the First Firmament, who was the [[wikipedia:Alpha|Alpha]] (beginning).{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 6}}

====Creation of the Seventh Cosmos and Encountering Knull====
[[File:Celestials and Knull (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 4 4.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Celestials filling the void left by the previous universe]]
Upon entering the Abyss left by the destruction of the sixth universe,{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} they filled it with the [[Earth-616|seventh universe]]; however, they encountered [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], a primordial god of darkness who had ruled over that Abyss.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} Enraged, Knull attacked and decapitated [[Headless Celestial (Earth-616)|a Celestial]] using [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a sword of living darkness]], and began a war against the Celestials and their creations.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} The [[Headless Celestial (Earth-616)|body and soul]] of the felled Celestial were bound to Knull and trapped in the [[Realm Between]], while the severed head was turned into the mining city and space station of [[Knowhere]].{{r|King in Black: Return of the Valkyries Vol 1 2}}

====Infinity Stones====
The Celestials were responsible for sending the [[Infinity Stones]] to their respective universes.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 6}}

====The Watchers====
In opposition to the Celestials' apparent agenda were the [[Watchers]]. Having sworn an oath of non-interference in species younger than themselves, the Watchers found the Celestials' genetic engineering of such species to be the antithesis of what they believed in. Thus, the Watchers and the Celestials were in a non-confrontational conflict for billions of years. (As Watchers do not act.){{r|Fantastic Four #400}}

[[File:Black Vortex from Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|left|Black Vortex]]
====[[Black Vortex]]====
An object called the "[[Black Vortex]]" was created 12 billion years ago by the Celestial named [[Godhead (Earth-616)|Godhead]]. Godhead created the Black Vortex after an individual named [[Gara (Viscardi) (Earth-616)|Gara]] from the alien [[Viscardi (Race)|Viscardi]] species expressed to the cosmic being her species' desire to explore beyond their race's current potential. Gara was the first of the Viscardi to use the Black Vortex and gain enormous power. One year later, a war among the Viscardi left Gara as the sole survivor of her species.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: Black Vortex Alpha #1}}

===Interest in Earth===
====The Progenitor and the Fallen====
[[File:Progenitor (Celestial) (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 8 26 001.jpg|right|thumb|[[Progenitor (Celestial) (Earth-616)|The Progenitor]]]]
Four billion years ago, a Celestial referred to as the [[Progenitor (Celestial) (Earth-616)|Progenitor]] crashed onto Earth after it was infected by the [[Horde (Race)|Horde]]. The Progenitor died a sad, lonely death, and its body was buried within the Earth below the [[North Pole]]. The Celestial's diseased body fluids seeped into the Earth and percolated through the planet's primeval surface, forever altering the Earth's evolutionary trajectory. [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]] claimed that this process ultimately gave rise to the superhuman abnormalities present in many of Earth's inhabitants.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 5}}

A million years ago, a Celestial named [[Zgreb (Earth-616)|Zgreb the Aspirant]] came to Earth in search for the Progenitor. Zgreb found the Progenitor and became inflicted with the Horde. However, the Horde mutated him into a rabid "[[Dark Celestials (Horde)|Dark Celestial]]," the first of its kind. Zgreb went berserk and entered into conflict with the [[Avengers (1,000,000 BC) (Earth-616)|Avengers of the Stone Age]]. They defeated the weakened and sickly Zgreb,{{r|Avengers Vol 8 4}} and buried it underground in the territory that would become [[South Africa]] in modern times.{{r|Marvel Legacy Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Celestials experiment on apes from Eternals Vol 1 1.png|thumb|left|The Celestials experiment on the apes of Earth]]
====The First Host====
The loss of the two Celestials drew the attention of the rest of their kind, and the [[Glossary:First Host|First Host]] came to Earth. The Stone Age Avengers tried to fight the visitors, but they were soundly defeated. To look after the result of the contagion,{{r|{{cl|Avengers Vol 8 4}}-[[Avengers Vol 8 5|5]]}} the First Host of Celestials then genetically engineered one hundred [[Eternals (Homo immortalis)|Eternals]] (''Homo immortalis'').{{r|Eternals Vol 5 1}} In addition to that, they also created one hundred grotesques [[Deviants (Homo descendus)|Deviants]] (''Homo descendus'') and developed the [[X-Gene]] that would eventually give rise to mutants.{{r|Marvel Fact Files Vol 1 8}}{{r|What If? Vol 1 23}}

====The Monoliths====
After the creation of these species, the Celestials created the mysterious objects known as [[Black Monoliths (Celestials)|Black Monoliths]] to help record vast amounts of data over the centuries.{{r|2001, A Space Odyssey Vol 2 1}}{{r|X-51 Vol 1 12}} Numerous humans interacted with these Black Monoliths over the centuries.{{r|2001, A Space Odyssey Vol 2 1|8}}

====The [[Second Host]] and the [[Great Cataclysm]]====
The Second Host of the Celestials arrived on Earth circa 18000 BCE. At the time, the [[Deviants (Homo descendus)|Deviants]], who far outnumbered the [[Eternals (Homo immortalis)|Eternals]] and the humans, were in the middle of war against on [[Atlantis]] and attacked the Celestial ship. In retaliation, the Celestials landed on [[Lemuria]]. At the same time, the Atlanteans opened their magma vents to drive off the Deviants. Either by Celestial will alone, or the combined forces of Atlantis, the Eternals and The might of the Celestials, the continent of Lemuria was destroyed and Atlantis sunk beneath the sea. This Great Cataclysm reshaped the Earth's surface.{{r|Eternals Vol 1 1}}

It is also known that near this time, [[Arishem]] came into conflict with [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|The Dreaming Celestial]]. The reason for this conflict is unknown and differing reasons have been given, but may have been about the course of the "experiment" on [[Earth-616]].{{r|Eternals Vol 4 3}} The conflict ended with defeat and burial of The Dreaming Celestial under what would later become Northern [[California (State)|California]] near [[San Francisco]].

===Celestial Contract===
At some point, using old hieroglyphs, Nur built his large Sphinx-shaped ship with alien materials, in part on his own as the ship also built itself, and began to hear a voice inside of his head. The voice belonged to the [[Celestials|Celestial]], [[Eson (Earth-616)|Eson the Searcher]], who spoke through [[Telepathy|telepathy]] and called Nur "Apocalypse". Eson presented Nur with the proposition to use the technology on the ship to shape the destiny of the world, or simply leave and never remember anything. Nur accepted and Eson stated that one day, maybe in centuries or millennia, the Celestials would come for payments for their gifts.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 186}}

====1st Century====
[[File:Celestial Madonna (Earth-616) from S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 1 001.png|thumb|right|Celestial Madonna]]
The '''[[Celestial Madonna (Earth-616)|Celestial Madonna]]''' an apparent female Celestial, appeared in 114 AD at the palace of [[Zhang Heng (Earth-616)|Zhang Heng]], a member of the [[Brotherhood of the Shield (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of the Shield]] in [[Luoyang]]. Zhang went to her,{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. #1}} and revealed him the existence of the [[Celestial Egg]] existing within [[Earth]], and revealed as well that she was carrying a child, something "new/unique/forbidden". That birth would destroy her in any case, but would need nourishment. As she was hesitating between using Earth, causing quick extinction, or the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]], with cataclysmic consequences on Earth, Zhang Heng proposed an alternative: the [[Sun (Star)|Sun]]. Bathing herself in the Earth's sun, she was destroyed while her [[Star Child (Earth-616)|progeny]] was found by [[Leonardo da Vinci (Earth-616)|Leonardo da Vinci]] in 1956.{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. #4}}

====The Third Host====
The Third Host came to Earth about 1000 years ago. Once again the Celestials moved across the globe experimenting and testing their handiwork. Wary of the intervention of these "alien gods" [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin Borson]] convened a gathering of all the known Sky-Gods like himself and choose three of their number to meet with the Celestials. Odin, [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus Panhellenios]], and [[Vishnu (Hindu Deity) (Earth-616)|Vishnu]] confronted [[Arishem (Earth-616)|Arishem]], but Arishem was unfazed by their assault. Arishem then attacked the gods' home dimensions, and proved that it alone had the power to cut off each and every pantheon from Earth. This lead to all the Skyfathers pledging to not interfere with the Celestials for 1000 years.{{r|Thor #300}}

[[File:Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 6 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Thor vs. Apocalypse]]
===11th Century===
In 1013, Apocalypse came to [[Scandinavia]] to kill on the counsel of [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Rama-Tut]] who informed him of beings and ancestors of people who would cause a threat to him in the future. After defeating Thor he went to [[London (England)|London]] and sent his four [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Four Horsemen]] ([[Phantom Bats of the Twelve Minds (Earth-616)|Pestilence/Phantom Bats of the Twelve Minds]], [[War (11th Century) (Earth-616)|War]], Native-American [[Famine (11th Century) (Earth-616)|Famine]], and [[Death (11th Century) (Earth-616)|Death]]) to kill [[Folkbern Logan (Earth-616)|Folkbern Logan]], ancestor of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], but they were all destroyed by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]. [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] faced off with En Sabah Nur. He was defeated. Seeking revenge, Thor blessed [[Jarnbjorn]] with his own blood to imbue it with the power to pierce Celestial armor. Not willing to except defeat, Apocalypse destroyed his Celestial Pyramid ship in a failed attempt to kill Thor.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #6}}

===The Celestial Ship & The Traveler===
In the mid 12th century Ho-Lo Shan Mountains of Northern [[Mongolia]], Nur heard of a ruler, who was powered by an immense [[glossary:A#Alien|alien]] [[Prosh (Earth-616)|Ship]] which crashed, and sought him out as another immortal. In a confrontation, Nur slew all of [[Garbha-Hsien (Earth-616)|Garbha-Hsien]]'s guards. Garbha-Hsien then sought to humble his fellow 'forever-walker', by revealing the secret titanic vessel. Having had previous experience with futuristic technology, Nur attacked Garbha-Hsien and left the other immortal for dead. Not understanding how to kill an immortal, Garbha-Hsien survived and fled. After striking down Garbha-Hsien, Nur entered the Ship and lived on it for many years, not fully understanding how to communicate with it or control it. Shortly after finding the Ship, Nur and his Riders of the Dark were constantly attacked, by a young warrior with a sword and shield calling himself the [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Traveler]].{{r|X-Force 37}}{{r|Cable & Deadpool #26}}{{r|X of Swords Handbook Vol 1 1}}

After years of sending assassins and battling the Traveler, Nur severed Traveler's left cybernetic arm and, during the confusion, the Traveler pulled a gun and shot him in the head. After reattaching his techno-organic arm, Traveler was accepted as the new leader of the Riders of the Dark, but declined. Traveler turned to Ozymandias and instructed him to remember that there will always be someone smarter and stronger around and that being fit to survive means to have the responsibility to help those who are not. Unaware to the Traveler, his techno-organic infected blood mixed with Nur's, as he wiped Nur's blood on Ozymandias. Ozymandias had Nur's dead body brought to the alien Ship, hoping that its technology could heal him, and Traveler arrived, to ambush a caravan of advanced technology. Traveler explained to Ozymandias that the Ship was actually a Celestial transport for a highly advanced alien race, a sentient exploratory device, and entered the ship. Inside, Traveler learned that his blood, mixed with the [[Techno-Organic Virus]], and Nur's resurrected Nur and, infected with the virus, allowed Nur to understand Ship. Nur was transformed and enhanced by Celestial technology, becoming one of the most powerful beings who would ever live, now possessing the ability of total control over the molecular structure of his body. Angry at the revelation, Traveler told Nur that if he was responsible for his immortality, he would make Nur spend eternity far away from there and sent both Ship and its passenger far into space. Over the next few centuries, Ship's sentience slowly evolved and Nur noticed, but enslaved it, telling Ship that he had created it. After gaining so much power, Nur also began to take long slumbers in Ship and to refuel his powers.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #26|27}}

====The Fourth Host====
[[File:Thor Vol 1 300 024.jpg|thumb|right|Fourth Host]]
In the 20th century, the Fourth Host of Celestials returned to Earth to judge the final stage in their genetic experiments. To do this, they settled on the Inca plateau in South America and collected materials and beings from across the globe. The appearance of these enigmatic giants around the world terrified the world's population and triggered the attempted intervention of [[S.H.I.E.L.D. (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. The Celestials sealed themselves inside an impenetrable dome and began their judgement. Odin, fearful of Celestial power and angered by their interference on Earth, gathered the life force of all of Asgard to battle the Celestials for the fate of the Earth. Despite having Thor and the Eternals at his side, The Celestials defeated Odin and spared the Earth after the intervention of [[Gaea (Earth-616)|Gaea]] and the "gift" of 12 special humans selected from every pantheon. The Fourth Host then left Earth erasing the memory of their existence from the minds of humanity.{{r|Thor #300}}

====Dreaming Celestial at San Francisco====
Early in the 21st century, after being manipulated into awakening [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|The Dreaming Celestial]], the Eternals learned that it was only through the efforts of the Eternal [[Makkari (Earth-616)|Makkari]] that it did not "reset local space-time one billion years past" or "destroy this corner of the Milky Way Galaxy." It was angry over its imprisonment but decided instead to observe and investigate the Earth. The very presence of the Dreaming Celestial was initially considered a threat and dangerous to the very existence of humanity, and all life on Earth by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. It was only through the mental intervention of the Eternals that the 2000 foot Golden Celestial now standing in [[Golden Gate Park]], was accepted by humanity at large.{{r|Eternals Vol 3 7}}

[[File:Tiamut (Earth 616) 003.jpg|thumb|left|Tiamut]]
As time passed, the Celestial's emotional and mental stability was becoming more and more erratic as it claimed to be questioning the reason for its imprisonment, its place as designated by the [[Fulcrum (Earth-616)|Fulcrum]] and its/his plans for all of creation. The Dreaming Celestial began exhibiting more "non"-Celestial behaviors, such as admiring [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]'s guile in battle and the "un-doing" of the death of the Eternal [[Thena (Earth-616)|Thena]]'s human son, so much that [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu]] the Watcher began to question the Celestial's mental balance.

Soon after the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] and [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Sinister]] tampered with the Dreaming Celestial's armor, the prime Celestial Host came to Earth, apparently finally taking an interest in its re-awakening. [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops']] [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|Extinction Team]] boldly attempted to bluff the assembled Celestials, asking them to leave; they consented, but only when the Dreaming Celestial itself, no longer infested by Mr. Sinister's machinations, told them to by pointing skyward.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 1}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 3|3]]}}

By this time, the Dreaming Celestial's confusion and questioning of itself was beginning to physically affect the people it communicated with culminating in the death of Makkari, the subsequent "death" of [[Sersi (Earth-616)|Sersi]], and "rebirth" of Makkari all due to the Eternal's relationship with the Celestial. Finally confronting its "creator", the Fulcrum/"Jack", it choose to leave this plane of existence with it/him.{{r|Eternals Vol 4 9}}

====[[X-Termination]]====<!-- Exterminators' origin to be placed chronologically -->
[[File:Exterminators (Race) from Age of Apocalypse Vol 1 14 0003.jpg|thumb|right|Exterminator]]
The Celestials thought that with life and creation there must be death and destruction, so they created the '''[[Exterminators (Race)|Exterminators]]''' to be that death and destruction. However, the Exterminators turned against the Celestials who couldn't kill them, so they separated the universe into the [[Multiverse]] and imprisoned and bonded them into space between the walls separating realities. However, the Celestials didn't learn from their first mistake and created the [[Death Seed]] with the same purpose, but far more manageable.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 61}} The Exterminators were trapped in their prison for millennia, until the walls between realities began to weaken. Tears, cracks, and fissures grew larger and larger until the Exterminators were able to escape.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 2 12}}{{r|X-Termination #1}}

[[Kurt Darkholme (Earth-295)|AOA Nightcrawler]] and [[Henry McCoy (Earth-295)|Dark Beast]] used the [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|Dreaming Celestial]] to create a portal to [[Earth-295|their world]]. Unfortunately, this portal opened the rift between realities wide enough for the Exterminators to pass through to [[Earth-295]].{{r|X-Termination #1}}

When the Exterminators emerged, they were greeted by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], the [[X-Men (Multiverse)|transdimensional X-Men]], and the [[X-Terminated (Earth-295)|X-Terminated]].{{r|X-Termination #1}}{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 60}}

One of the Exterminators departed to Earth-616 where he drained the Dreaming Celestial while the other two Exterminators remained on Earth-295, one feeding off the rift and the other seeking out the power of [[Apocalypse]] in the [[Death Seed]].{{r|Age of Apocalypse #14}} 

Once again, as [[Tiamut]] was supposedly already dead by its own hand on [[Earth-616]], Celestial events become convoluted and almost mythological.{{r|Eternals Vol 4 9}}

====[[Uncanny Avengers Vol 1|Mutant Rapture and Judgement of Earth]]====<!-- to be purged from unnecessary details -->
[[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]] recovered [[Jarnbjorn]] from [[Karl Mordo (Earth-616)|Baron Mordo]]'s tomb in [[Brazil]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers #6}}

Kang gave the axe to [[Uriel (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Uriel]] during his training to become the new [[Apocalypse]]. Uriel used the weapon to kill a [[Celestial Gardeners (Earth-616)|Celestial Gardener]] outside the [[Starcore One|Starcore Station]] as part of the [[Apocalypse Twins (Earth-616)|Apocalypse Twins']] plan to trick the Celestials into destroying Earth while they evacuated all of Earth's [[Homo superior|mutants]] to [[Planet X]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers #7}}

Thor later retrieved the Jarnbjorn and used it to kill/destroy the space armor of [[Exitar the Executioner]] before it could destroy Earth. Whether this truly destroyed the Celestial, or merely shunted it back to wherever the Celestials truly live as the Invisible Woman had previously done to help end the so-called Celestial-Watcher War is unknown.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #21}}{{r|Fantastic Four #400}} 

After Exitar's "destruction", [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] revealed to [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] that he would take a great journey moving the Celestial body far from Earth. Before leaving, he warned her that they must prepare themselves because the Celestials' wrath would be mighty.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #22}}

====[[Time Runs Out]]====
Among their many solutions to halt the [[Glossary:Incursion|Incursions]], the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] asked [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] to arrange a meeting with the Celestials so the group could ask them for help. However, during the meeting, the Celestials mysteriously vanished.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 29}} The explanation for this event was that the Celestials were being attacked in every universe at the same time by the [[Beyonders]], who after a long battle managed to kill them all.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 30}}

===Eighth Cosmos===
After the recreation of the universe the First Firmament sent one of his [[Aspirants|Aspirants]] to cause damage to Eternity.{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 6}} The arrival of this [[Celestial Destructor (Earth-616)|Celestial Destructor]] was foreseen by the precognitive [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses Cain]]. The entity appeared in [[New York City]] near [[Stark Tower]] where it was confronted by the joint forces of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]], [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], [[Ultimates (Earth-616)|Ultimates]], [[A-Force (Earth-616)|A-Force]], [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], [[New Attilan]]'s [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]], and other heroes including [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Hellstorm]], [[Michael Twoyoungmen (Earth-616)|Shaman]], [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]], [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]], [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Hulk]], and [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]]. While most of the heroes were busy fighting the [[Servitor (Earth-616)|Servitors]], the magic users of the group cast a spell that returned the Celestial to its own dimension.{{r|Civil War II #1}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 12}}{{r|Civil War II: Gods of War #1}}

====[[Eternity War]]====
[[File:Land of Couldn't-Be Shouldn't-Be from Ultimates 2 Vol 1 100 002.jpg|thumb|right|Birth of the Fifth Host]]
As it turned out, not all of the Celestials were destroyed by the Beyonders. A handful of survivors managed to escape and hide out at the furthest edges of the universe within the deep folds of space-time. Unlike the other cosmic beings, the Celestials that were destroyed were apparently not brought back to life when the Multiverse was restored. The surviving Celestials were confronted by [[Logos (Cosmic Entity) (Earth-616)|Logos]], the fusion of [[Lord Chaos (Earth-616)|Lord Chaos]], [[Master Order (Earth-616)|Master Order]], and the [[In-Betweener (Earth-616)|In-Betweener]]. Logos believed himself to be the new judge of worlds, something the Celestials formerly did. Logos considered the Celestials to be unwanted competition as judges of worlds and thus destroyed the surviving Celestials, though he was told that nothing truly died by the [[Queen of Nevers (Earth-616)|Queen of Nevers]], who secretly saved the One Above All while Logos killed the other Celestials, making him the last Celestial.{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 4}}

It was later revealed that Logos was being manipulated by the First Firmament in a bid to return to its original position as everything that is.{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 6}} The Celestials were eventually returned to life as the Fifth Host by the Queen of Nevers to thwart the First Firmament's attempt to take over the Multiverse.{{r|Ultimates 2 #100}}

====The Final Host====
Zgreb was eventually awakened in modern times when a team of archaeologists uncovered the underground cavern it was sealed in. The Fallen shouted "Summon... the Final Host!" while killing the archaeologists. Later, [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]], the Asgardian God of Mischief,{{r|Marvel Legacy #1}} released the Fallen from its prison and used it to bring about the Final Host of [[Dark Celestials (Horde)|Dark Celestials]] in order to wipe out Earth, arguing that the planet was ill-ridden as a result of the Progenitors' arrival and death having altered the Earth's evolutionary trajectory billions of years prior. Before arriving to Earth, the Dark Celestials used the Horde to infect and kill every Celestial in existence. Their bodies were hurled to the Earth to herald the arrival of their murderers.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 1|5}}

During the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]' final stand against the Dark Celestials, the bodies of the felled Celestials were reanimated by the Horde. When the Avengers joined their energies to form a gestalt [[Uni-Mind]], they used its power to defeat the Horde, and it became dormant. The Celestials were freed from its influence, and they helped the Avengers take down the Dark Celestials.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 6}}

====King in Black====
En route to Earth, Knull decided to settle his eons-old score with the Celestials and slew at least three of them, reanimating and controlling their corpses using his living abyss.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/podcasts/directors-commentary-donny-cates-and-ryan-stegman-on-king-in-black-1?linkId=106761054|title=Directors' Commentary: Donny Cates and Ryan Stegman on 'King in Black' #1|work=Marvel.com|first=Tucker Chet|last=Markus|date=9 December 2020|accessdate=9 December 2020}}}}

=="Biology"==
[[File:Tiamut (Earth-616) from Eternals Vol 4 9 001.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The Dreaming Celestial's face]]
===Appearance===
The Celestials usually appear as massive armor-clad humanoids of enormous size, with most of them standing two thousand feet (610 meters) in height and some even larger (Exitar stands over 20,000 feet high).{{r|Thor #389}} Each varies in color and design, which is very elaborate in some individuals. Each has one head, two arms & two legs, indistinct features on their helmets sometimes exhibiting two eyes, sometimes more, sometimes none. The designs on their armor are of a practical nature and each serves a function of one kind or another, Arsheim's formula of judgement on its thumb for example. Many, but not all, also have great equipment on their backs or carry great staffs capable of breaking down and reconstructing all forms of energy & matter or lay waste of entire continents. It has been reported that the Celestials' bodies are modular, made up of thousands of varied objects and beings. It has also been reported that they may combine to create larger more powerful amalgams and can animate severed limbs and even their computer-ware is sentient.{{citation}}

Celestials' armor can be taken off. After the [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|Dreaming Celestial]] took off his helmet, he revealed his glowing face.{{r|Eternals Vol 4 9}}

===Internal Anatomy===
Their interior is comprised of black bio-mechanical matter which is capable of absorbing the souls of their experiments,{{r|King in Black: Return of the Valkyries Vol 1 1}} such as the Eternals, in order to sustain themselves.{{r|Eternals Vol 4 2}} The Celestials also have a variety of internal defenses, such as armored behemoths, jellyfish-like antibodies, and winged and tentacled creatures which swarm in great numbers while firing powerful blasts from their single eye.

====Armor====
Allegedly, no one has even seen a Celestial without armor. A theory from scientists is that they exist in [[Glossary:Hyperspace|Hyperspace]], while their armors are simply channels allowing them to interact in the regular plane of reality.{{r|Fantastic Four #400}}

On [[Earth-90266]], it was stated that the armors worked on willpower and were controlled by thoughts.{{r|What If? Newer Fantastic Four #1}}

===Origins and "Replication/Reproduction"===
=====Celestial Eggs within planets=====
It was stated by the [[Celestial Madonna (Earth-616)|Celestial Madonna]] that [[Earth]] and many other worlds were implanted with a [[Celestial Egg]]/Embryo at their center, gestating for millions of years before birthing and consuming the planet.{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. #4}} Similar processes was witnessed in [[Earth-9997]]{{r|Earth X #9}} and other realities.{{r|{{cl|Paradise X: Heralds Vol 1 1}}-[[Paradise X: Heralds Vol 1 3|3]]}}

This process of reproduction is seemingly the rule,{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. #4}} but not the only way Celestials come into being.

=====Gestation within Celestials=====
The Celestial Madonna was herself carrying a Celestial, something she considered "new/unique/forbidden". The process/cycle/function of replication/reproduction was assured to cause the mother's death, and required suitable nourishment, who could be found in Earth, the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]] (causing their destruction) or the [[Sun (Star)|Sun]]. The infant Celestial, dubbed the [[Star Child (Earth-616)|Star Child]], was stated to be a "variant Celestial".{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. #4}}
<!-- 
...{{r|Eternals Vol 4 2}}<!-- I have a pic incoming -->

=====Black Galaxy=====
For millions of years, the [[Black Galaxy]] was a universal curiosity, an area of space composed entirely of biological matter. In recent times, it was revealed to be the birth crèche of a new Celestial. A [[Red Celestial (Earth-616)|Red Celestial]] oversaw the process, using armored capsules to assemble the full armor of a new Celestial. The bodies of [[Eric Masterson (Earth-616)|Eric Masterson]] and [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] were incorporated into this mixture. Also, a sphere of pure white energy became the center point for the Celestial's creation. When the alleged Celestial-slayer called [[Stellaris (Earth-616)|Stellaris]] made a kamikaze run on the white sphere, her megaton impact triggered the final birthing process. The white sphere expanded to encompass the entire Black Galaxy, then contracted back to its original size, pulling the bio-matter of the entire Galaxy back into that point, leaving behind light years of completely empty space. The compressed bio-verse of the sphere and the assembled Celestial armor combined to produce a new and unnamed [[Blue Celestial (Earth-616)|Blue Celestial]].

The Rigellian Analyzer proffered that the Celestials may have created the Black Galaxy or merely commandeered it, and that the supposedly antagonistic Stellaris was both a necessary part of the birth process and encased in living armor identical to the Celestials'.{{r|Thor #419|424}}

====Planetary Uni-Minds====
According to [[Mira (Earth-616)|Varua]]'s insight, the [[Celestials]] are Uni-Minds of entire planets clad in armors. That theory led her to create the [[Panhuman Uni-Mind (Earth-616)|Panhuman Uni-Mind]], for it to be put by the [[Young Gods (Earth-616)|Young Gods]] into an armor as the Celestial Terran. It is unknown if that is true, though [[Makkari (Earth-616)|Makkari]] expressed doubt and [[Legba (Eternal) (Earth-616)|Legba]] hinted it wasn't true.{{r|Eternals Annual Vol 4 1}}

====[[M'Kraan (Race)|Mutant M'Kraan]] evolved beyond====
On [[Earth-92131]], the race now known as the M'Kraan developed individuals who could be referred as mutants. That species of cosmic mutants then evolved a step beyond mutants, becoming the [[Celestials]].{{r|X-Men '92 Vol 2 9}}

One of those, [[Xodus (Earth-92131)|Xodus the Harvester]], thought that mutants from other worlds would eventually rise to replace his kind.{{r|X-Men '92 Vol 2 9}}

====Creation Constellation====
A mysterious device known as the [[Creation Constellation]], was discovered by two human scientist which turned them, including [[Inez Temple (Earth-616)|Outlaw]] and [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] into Celestials.{{r|Domino: Hotshots #3}}

===Celestial Pathology===
All Celestials are linked to one another by quantum telepathy, meaning no matter where or when they are they are in communion with each other.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 16}}<!-- 

...{{r|Marvel Legacy #1}}

Also possibly relevant: Mad Celestials. -->

<!-- to be restructured -->
==Agenda==
The Celestials' agenda is ultimately unknown, as is the exact purpose of the Celestials' genetic manipulation and "responsibilities". Repeatedly returning to each world, the races in question are evaluated over a 50 Earth-year period and should a test-subject race "fail" by the Celestials' standards, [[Arishem (Earth-616)|Arishem the Judge]]'s judgement calls the coming of [[Exitar (Earth-616)|Exitar the Exterminator]] to the target world. Exitar, a Celestial ten times Arishem's own height, "purifies" the offending world of the race (or races) by destroying those non-life-affirming elements. [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] was on the planet [[Pangoria]] when this happened, and was told the issues at stake were "too great for even an immortal to grasp".{{r|Thor #389}}

According to the Dreaming Celestial, the Celestial race are the instruments of the teeming of life in their respective universes under the will of an entity known as [[Fulcrum (Earth-616)|The Fulcrum]] that serves as the mastering force behind the equilibrium of all creation. Planets populated by a viable base species possessing the requisite neurological potential are chosen for cultivation. One hundred specimens are evolved into [[Eternals]], another hundred, into [[Deviants]], with the former being created to be more powerful while the latter being created to breed more efficiently and prodigiously. The Celestials then leave their specimens to their own devices and after nineteen cosmic cycles the tested planets are chosen for destruction. The aggregate energy from the base species is harvested and channeled to the Fulcrum. If the planet's aggregate energy signature is consistent with the Eternals, then the life force will be transferred to the Celestials before being sent to the Fulcrum. However, if the aggregate energy signature is consistent with the Deviants, then the life force will be transferred to the Horde, a malicious counterpart to the Celestials and the instrument of reaping on chosen planets under the order of the Fulcrum.{{r|Eternals Vol 4 2}}

Due to their imposing presence, all-concealing armor, and seeming indifference/omnipotence to those whom they judge, the Celestials have acquired the sobriquet of "Space Gods" used by many star-faring races. On their last evaluatory visit to [[Earth-616]] in the Fourth Host, the Celestials wiped all memory of their existence from most of humanity. The only entities remaining aware of the Celestials' existence were the [[Asgardians]], who actively opposed the Celestials' unrevealed motives; the other pantheons; and Earth's Eternals and Deviants. In modern times, however, with the rise of superhumans, many superheroes rediscovered the existence of the Celestials.

==[[Multiverse|Alternate Reality Versions]]==
===[[Earth X]] ([[Earth-9997]])===
[[File:Celestials from Universe X Vol 1 12 001.jpg|350px|thumb|left|Celestials of Earth X]]
According to the visions of [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-9997)|Kyle Richmond]] and the Watcher's equipment, the Celestials came from the same universe as the [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-9997)|Elders of the Universe]]. These beings would advance their natural evolution to such a state in which they would begin to lose all definition. In an attempt to maintain what little identity they had left, the Celestials would create giant suits of armor out of [[Vibranium]] to inhabit. The Celestials also lost the means to reproduce, and would soon find a very devastating way around this: by "impregnating" a planet with a portion of their essence, it would become an "embryo" that would gestate and grow into a new member of their race. The planet in question would also be "injected" with Vibranium to form into a new shell for the newly born Celestial. As a form of protection of that growing Celestial, its "parents" would manipulate the DNA of a planet's dominant life-form to gain super-abilities and unknowingly act as antibodies, protecting the planet until the Celestial is born.

Each race they manipulated would have three tiers of mutation, the first would be for each individual to manifest their own powers. These powers usually would manifest when triggered by a catalyst (radiation for example), and the powers would vary depending on a number of factors, usually a combination of the outside catalyst and the subjects subconscious image of themselves. The second tier would be to have every member of their race exhibit the same ability, and the third would be a total loss of identity, those at this stage would be defined by what others around them believed them to be. This was installed as a fail-safe, should the Celestials ever have to quell a rebellion, it would be a matter of willing their wayward anti-bodes dead.

The Celestials would soon overpopulate their home universe, causing its collapse and the event that would lead to its own creation. This event would lead to the birth of [[Galan (Earth-9997)|Galactus]], who unknown to most but the most cosmically aware was actually an equalizer to insure that the Celestials would never overpopulate the universe again by feeding on some of the planets they impregnate.

In the early days of the new universe, the [[Watchers#Earth X (Earth-9997)|Watchers]] would be forced to maintain their pact of non-involvement by the Celestials after not acting to prevent the birth of Galactus, and then later interfering with an alien race which would then create atomic weapons that would destroy their world. The Celestials would then place a Watcher on a moon of each world they impregnated. Forced to watch these worlds, the Watchers eventually would work to maintain the Celestials' propagation roles, and at least in the case of [[Uatu (Earth-9997)|Uatu]], Earth's Watcher, interfere with events on the planet when they threatened the Celestials' plans.

Over the centuries, the Celestials would be responsible for manipulating the [[Kree#Earth-9997|Kree]], the [[Skrulls#Earth-9997|Skrulls]], the [[Asgardians (Earth-9997)|Asgardians]] and many more. The Earth became subject to one of the Celestial's propagations during the time of the dinosaurs. Removing a portion of the Earth to create the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]], the Celestials were responsible for the dinosaurs' extinction. They would place Uatu on Earth's moon.

Next, the Celestials would manipulate the DNA of mankind, however some tribes of humans would escape the Celestials' manipulations, such as the [[Moon Clan (Earth-9997)|Moon Tribe]]. The Celestials would create the [[Deviants (Homo descendus)#Earth X (Earth-9997)|Deviants]] and the [[Eternals (Homo immortalis)#Earth X (Earth-9997)|Eternals]] to keep the human race in check until they themselves would begin mutating with special powers due to their own natural evolution. The Celestials' involvement in the universe since is presumably the same as that of [[Earth-616]].

In recent times, [[Reed Richards (Earth-9997)|Reed Richards]] had succeeded in converting Galactus into a star, thus throwing off the universal balance, and being forced to work with the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-9997)|High Evolutionary]] and the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-9997)|Silver Surfer]] to advance his son [[Franklin Richards (Earth-9997)|Franklin]]'s mutation to the third tier and convince him that he is Galactus in order to restore that balance.

When the entire human race was mutated by the release of the [[Terrigen Mist]] in Earth's atmosphere, it sped up the natural process of the planet's evolution. The Celestials would come to Earth in order to terminate the project, however they would get opposition by the new Galactus, who would fight them off until they retreated. Galactus would then kill the Celestial growing in Earth's core, but sparing the planet. It would cause the mass of the planet to change and throw its axis off, but this too in time would be corrected.

Since then, the Celestials have had no contact with Earth, nor are their current activities known, however [[X-51 (Earth-9997)|X-51]] had gathered a group of [[Heralds (Earth-9997)|Heralds]] from other realities for the purpose of informing the Earths of each reality of the potential danger of the Celestials.

The Celestials' physical forms are almost completely lacking in definition, and are probably an energy base of some kind. In order to maintain individuality, they have constructed giant suits of armor to inhabit. These suits of armor are constructed out of Vibranium.

They are an alien race that advanced its natural evolution to a point in which their species almost lost all sense of identity. In order to maintain individuality, they would construct suits of armor to live in. Impregnating planets with their essence, they would reproduce. This brought upon the end of the previous universe. The Celestials survived the death of the old universe and have started their procreation anew.{{r|Earth X #0}}

The Watchers were revealed to have been enslaved by the Celestials as guardians of unborn Celestials which existed in certain planets such as Earth.

An energy blast from the Destroyer with the power of Asgard was "passively deflected by a casually upraised Celestial hand," indicating the difference in power.{{r|Thor #300}} There are also higher level Celestials who are far stronger than the Fourth Host.{{r|Thor Annual #14}}

'''Nigh-Absolute Immortality:''' The Celestials are immortal beings that are very difficult to kill or harm. [[Arishem (Earth-616)|Arishem]] withstood attacks from three Skyfathers at the same time completely unfazed.{{r|Thor #300}} A Mad Celestial even survived the [[Ultimate Nullifier (Weapon)|Ultimate Nullifier]],{{r|FF #14}} though it is possible that the wielder's mind was not powerful enough. Celestials can instantly regenerate lost limbs.{{r|Thor #300}} Celestials can be revived by their brethren,{{r|Fantastic Four #400}} and a single Celestial can be used as a seed to revive the entire race.{{r|Ultimates 2 #100}}

| Notes                   = * The concept of the Celestials and their involvement in human history may have been inspired by the theories of [[Wikipedia:Erich von Däniken|Erich von Däniken]], which were first explored in the 1968 book ''[[Wikipedia:Chariots of the Gods|Chariots of the Gods]]''.
* As old and as enigmatic as the Celestial race is, many myths have appeared around the Universe in attempts to describe these "Space Gods": 
** [[Nathaniel Richards (Earth-616)|Nathaniel Richards]] once speculated that they may have come from hyperspace, that the Celestial's armor were channels in which they could exist in this reality.{{r|Fantastic Four #400}}
** Another theory is that they came from the mysterious alternate "[[Celestial Universe]]" discovered during a trip through alternate realities by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Dr. Doom]], [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|The Thing]], The [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|Sharon Ventura]]. This was a reality completely overrun by Celestials and was only seen very briefly. 
** Another place thought to be the Celestial place of origin by the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] was a string of planets connected by Celestial technology. It was called the "[[World Complex Headquarters]]" and had been converted into a tourist trap by various alien races so that they could view the Celestials daily. However, this and their seeming defeat by him turned out to be an illusion created by the Celestials themselves, which in turn led to his rejection by the female mutant [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Tabitha Smith]].{{r|Secret Wars II #5}}
** There is also evidence to show that the Celestials were directly created or possibly their actions are directed by [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]] himself.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 5}}
** An artifact called the [[Creation Constellation (Earth-616)|Creation Constellation]] can turn people into miniature Celestials. Anyone who touches an "infected" person also starts to become a Celestial. [[Gaurie Marazov (Earth-616)|Gaurie Marazov]], [[Doctor Geun (Earth-616)|Doctor Geun]], [[Inez Temple (Earth-616)|Inez Temple]], [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Rachel Leighton]], [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Wade Wilson]], [[Ami Han (Earth-616)|Ami Han]], and [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Neena Thurman]] were all infected.{{r|Domino: Hotshots Vol 1 3}}{{r|Domino: Hotshots Vol 1 5}} The former two went mad and began to call themselves "Marazov the Penitent" and "Geun the Executioner";{{r|Domino: Hotshots Vol 1 4}} everyone else rejected the power.{{r|Domino: Hotshots Vol 1 5}}
[[File:Monoliths (Space Odyssey) from X-51 Vol 1 12 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monoliths from ''Space Odyssey'' appear in Marvel Comics]]
* The legendary [[Wikipedia:Monolith (Space Odyssey)|Black Monolith]] from [[Wikipedia:Arthur C. Clarke|Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:2001: A Space Odyssey|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' entered Marvel Continuity long ago (mostly because of nostalgia, since Machine Man's first appearance was in the [[2001, A Space Odyssey Vol 2|''2001'' comics]]). In the final issue of ''[[Machine Man Vol 1|Machine Man]]'', it was revealed that the creators of the monolith were the Celestials, who had sent it to help record vast amounts of data over the centuries.
** [[X-51 Vol 1 12|X-51 Issue #12]] (titled "Space Odyssey") features [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Aaron Stack]] entering a monolith like David Bowman in ''2001: A Space Odyssey''. The monolith is described as a "path to the stars" and it sent Aaron to its creators, the Celestials.{{r|X-51 #12}}
** A Celestial origin to Earth's other [[Black Monoliths of Xuthltan|mysterious black monoliths]] has not been revealed.
* According to the [[Fulcrum (Earth-616)|Fulcrum]], Celestials can evolve into beings of even greater power.{{r|Eternals Vol 4 9}}
| Trivia                  = * It was speculated by [[Reptyl (Earth-616)|Reptyl]] that the Celestials may be the cause of the widespread evolution of mammalian life in many quadrants of the cosmos.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 12}}
* One of the [[Proemial Gods]] presented in {{cl|Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus #2}}, [[Brio (Earth-616)|Brio]], had a similar appearance and purpose to the Celestials.
* According to the [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|Dreaming Celestial]], Celestials are not supposed to show emotion, and if they do, they are supposed to shut themselves down and compress their mass into a black hole.{{r|Eternals Vol 4 7}} Celestials can choose to ignore this, however.
