| History                 = Vange Whedon is a lawyer and a member of the Mutant Rights Coalition (or [[Mutant Rights League (Earth-616)|Mutant Rights League]]). Her ability to shapeshift is triggered when she comes in contact with blood. Evangeline used to be a successful prosecutor until others soon learned that she was a mutant. She was fired instantly and evicted from her apartment the next day. Her fianc√© left her with an e-mail and her family disowned her.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 #40}}

When the X-Men [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] and [[Sage (Earth-616)|Sage]] were being held in police custody, Whedon and the Mutant Rights League staged a protest for their release. While Evangeline was talking to Detective Cardones, a human struck the detective with a brick. The blood from the wound dripped on to Whedon, and caused her to shapeshift involuntarily. She transformed into a beast that resembled a dragon, and was out of control. Sage was able to stop Vange momentarily, while Bishop calmed her down enough to revert to her human form.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 #21}}

Evangeline was called to [[Los Angeles]] when the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] needed legal help. Evangeline succeeded in getting [[Marie D'Ancanto (Earth-616)|Marie D'Ancanto]], an anti-mutant terrorist given a second chance by the X-Men, under probation and hired her as an assistant. Evangeline also helped the X-Men against a lawyer secretly working for the psychic mutant [[Elias Bogan (Earth-616)|Elias Bogan]].{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 #40|46}}

===After [[M-Day]]===
She kept her powers after the [[Decimation]] of the mutant population, the government considers her a 'Significant' national security threat.{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}}

Evangeline joined later the mutants on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] and was among them when the [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]]s were [[Second Coming|invading the island]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 #14}}

She was later put on the case of [[Teon Macik (Earth-616)|Primal (Teon Macik)]], when his parents wanted him back, but wasn't really motivated into helping the X-Men.{{r|Generation Hope #8}}
