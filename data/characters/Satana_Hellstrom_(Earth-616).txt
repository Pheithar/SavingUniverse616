===Early Life===
Satana Hellstrom was born a couple years after her brother [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon]]. When she was still a child, her mother [[Victoria Wingate Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Victoria Hellstrom]] discovered her [[Marduk Kurios (Earth-616)|husband]] and Satana performing a black magic ritual in the basement of their New England mansion. Victoria went mad upon witnessing her husband's transformation and died soon afterward.{{r|Marvel Spotlight #13}} Daimon was placed in an orphanage, and Satana was taken to "[[Hell]]" to be trained in the use of her demonic powers.{{r|Marvel Premiere #27}}

===Basilisk===
Satana was possessed by a powerful demon called the [[Basilisk (Demon) (Earth-616)|Basilisk]]. Satana remained in full control of her mind and body and the Basilisk had to do her bidding when she released it from her body. However, she became aware that the more she used the Basilisk to serve her ends, the stronger it grew, and that it might one day turn against her.{{r|Marvel Premiere #27}}

Satana was sent to Earth, where she continually needed to feed on souls. She often posed as a prostitute to meet her victims.{{r|Vampire Tales #2}}

Her father continued to test her, Satana eventually refused to serve him and tried her best to fight other evil forces as well as learn more about humans.{{r|Haunt of Horror Vol 2 #5}}

At one point, the sorcerer [[Brian Abelard (Earth-616)|Brian Abelard]] created an illusion that she was the woman Judith Chambers in a plot to take control of the Basilisk. He and the [[Camarilla of the N'Garai (Earth-616)|Camarilla of the N'Garai]] managed to separate Satana and the Basilisk, but Satana called upon the demon's help before they could sacrifice her, killing Abelard and the Camarilla, as well as re-merging the demon with her.{{r|Marvel Preview #7}}

===Doctor Strange===
Satana learned [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] had used [[Darkhold|Shartra's Book of the Damned]]. His physical body was cursed to be a [[Werewolves|werewolf]], while his astral self was imprisoned by demons. Knowing he was of great importance, Satana freed him and died, as did the Basilisk.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #81}}{{r|Hellstorm: Prince of Lies #8}}

===Resurrection===
As a supernatural being, however, Satana's death was not permanent. Her spirit returned to her father's realm of Hell for a time, until she and a cabal of demons arranged to have her soul placed into a soulless body on Earth.{{r|Hellstorm: Prince of Lies Vol 1 10}}{{r|Hellstorm: Prince of Lies Vol 1 12}}{{r|Hellstorm: Prince of Lies Vol 1 20|21}}

===Witches===
At some point she apparently died again. Satana was resurrected again by Doctor Strange and teamed with two other magic-wielders, [[Jennifer Kale (Earth-616)|Jennifer Kale]] and [[Topaz (Earth-616)|Topaz]], to defeat a powerful mystic enemy called the [[Hellphyr (Earth-616)|Hellphyr]]. It was later revealed that the three witches formed a coven in order to protect the [[Tome of Zhered-Na]] from would-be thieves such as Doctor Strange.{{r|Witches Vol 1 1|4}}

===Jason Silence===
Satana returned to travelling the country feeding on the souls of men and obeying her fathers contract to send one in every ten souls she takes to hell. One of these souls belonged to [[Jason Silence (Earth-616)|Jason Silence]] whose twin sister [[Jennifer Silence (Earth-616)|Jennifer]] was given a book of magic which she used to temporarily trap Satana in a pentagram of both divine and unholy design. Satana tricked her way free but having signed a contract to free Jason's soul, travelled to hell to search for him. The mother of all hell's vermin, the [[Scorpion Queen (Earth-616)|Scorpion Queen]], had stolen Jason's soul from Satana's father and she was forced to fight her to free him. Upon returning Jason to Earth, Satana used him and his sister for decoration in her lair.{{r|Legion of Monsters: Satana #1}}

===Thunderbolts===
After Jennifer Kale infiltrated [[The Raft|the Raft]] with ease, [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] teamed up with Doctor Strange to bring Satana into the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]].{{r|Thunderbolts #155}}

[[File:Satana Hellstrom (Earth-616) Thunderbolts Vol 1 155.png|thumb|right]]
===Traveling to the Past===
She escaped together with several other inmates who were members of the Thunderbolts. Due to a failure of the teleportation technology of their tower (caused by [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]]), the tower began to move in time as well as in space. They ended up in [[World War II]] teaming up with the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]] to battle the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazis]].{{r|Thunderbolts #163.1|165}} They ended up in Victorian [[London (England)|London]] next.{{r|Thunderbolts #166|168}} They went even further back in time ending up in [[Arthur Pendragon (Earth-616)|King Arthur]]'s court in [[Camelot]].{{r|Thunderbolts #169}}

They eventually bounced back to the time of the original Zemo-led Thunderbolts team.{{r|Thunderbolts #170|172}} After [[Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|the Fixer]] killed his younger-self, reality began to collapse, forcing the Fixer to assume his younger self's place. Following this, Satana returned to the future with the rest of the Thunderbolts.{{r|Thunderbolts #173|174}}

===All-New, All-Different Hell===
Satana eventually returned to the underworld to rule her own Hell. With the business of damnation booming, due to people's preference to spend afterlife in a chaotic self-indulgent frenzy together with the likes of dead rock stars and overdosed actors, Satana set out to make her realm stand out, by turning Doctor Strange into her Hell's newest attraction.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 14}}

After abducting Strange from a fight in the [[Dream Dimension|Dimension of Dreams]],{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 13}} she forced him to eat lethal food from her Hell's diner, so once he died his soul would be trapped there forever. While Satana left [[Martin Preston (Earth-616)|Master Pandemonium]] to guard Strange, the sorcerer used his astral projection to make himself vomit and stop the food poisoning. Following Strange's escape, Satana decided to settle with using [[James Douglas Morrison (Earth-616)|Jim Morrison]] instead.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 14}}

| Powers                  = Satana is a succubus, a particular type of demon blessed with great beauty and magical powers. Satana's soul was formerly bonded to an arch-demon and agent of destruction known as the "Basilisk." It was a very powerful demon, considered one of the deadliest, and she could release him from inside her and then return it to her.

*'''Life-Force Absorption:''' As a succubus, she feeds on the souls of people. Her kiss kills her victims, causing them to shrivel and release the soul in a butterfly-like form. Satana would then capture the butterfly to feed on it. When she takes people's souls, she gains power from them and it increases her magical powers. Apparently, it does not work on psionic vampires. 

*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Satana is much stronger than an ordinary human, though the upper limits of her strength are unknown.

*'''Superhuman Durability:''' Satana is more resistant to damage than an ordinary human, though the upper limits of her durability are unknown.

*'''Flight:''' Satana is able to levitate herself in order to fly.

*'''Astral Projection:''' Satana can release her astral form from her body, instantaneously and at will.

*'''Hellfire Manipulation:''' Satana possesses the ability to generate, control, and project hellfire (also known as soulfire) at will. Hellfire is an ethereal and supernatural flame that burns the soul of a person and can be used to burn their physical body as well as objects.{{r|Legion of Monsters: Satana #1}}

*'''Mind Control:''' Satana is able to enter and control the minds of others.

*'''Magic:''' Satana has shown that she possesses potent mystical power.
