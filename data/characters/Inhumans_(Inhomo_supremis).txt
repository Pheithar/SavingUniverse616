==[[Inhumans (Inhomo_supremis)/Alternate Universe Inhumans|Alternate Universe Inhumans]]==
The Inhumans are present in many realities, with more or less important variations in their history, appearances, and biology.

| Powers                  = Varies, if any. Even without using the [[Terrigen Mist]], centuries of selective breeding have given some Inhumans certain advantages. Their average lifespan is 150 years.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #5}}

Without Terrigenesis, [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]] possess strength, reaction time, speed, or endurance superior to humanity's most perfect physical specimen, [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], due to his eugenically superior Inhuman heritage and intensive training.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 6|; [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]]'s entry}} Other Inhumans haven't been clearly shown to possess such powers originated from training and eugenics solely.

[[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] claimed that "her people" didn't really feel cold.{{r|Inhuman #11}} It is unknown if it is a power common to Inhumans or if she is referring to the Attilans who lived for centuries in the [[North Atlantic]], then decades in the [[Himalayas]].

The Inhumans were meant by the Kree scientist who created them to be a ''"deadly weapon of cosmic scale"'', ''"[[Galactus]]-level weapons"''.{{r|Marvel Knights Millennial Visions #2001}}

| AvgStrength             = Inhumans' strength levels can vary regarding their powers, originated from [[Terrigenesis]] or hereditary transmission.

Without Terrigenesis, [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]] can lift 1 ton and is physically slightly superior to the peak of normal human physical achievement, due to his eugenically superior Inhuman heritage and intensive training.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 6|; [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]]'s entry}}

Other Inhumans, without Terrigenesis or extensive training, haven't been shown to display any degree of superhuman strength.
| Weaknesses              = Due to their closed society, Inhumans have a far lower threshold to disease and pollution than ordinary humans.{{r|Inhumans Special #1}}{{r|Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol 2 10}}

| GovernmentType          = Monarchy. Inhuman society is formatted in the style of a genocracy; ruled by the genetically fittest. As such, the elected Genetics Council is the major ruling body of the Inhumans besides the Royal Family.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #5}}

| CulturalTraits          = Miscegenation Prohibition, Rigid Caste System based on abilities, Conformists. Marriages have long been arranged by the government to eugenically further the race with couples only allowed to have a maximum of two offspring.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #5}} Those born with powers not useful enough to Inhuman society are cast off to live in the Darkward End of Attilan as rejected outcasts and unmentionables to be detached from their former associates and family members.{{r|Inhumans Vol 2 7}}

| Notes                   = * Inhumans were once stated by [[Dal Damoc (Earth-616)|Dal Damoc]] to be the products of [[Kree]] experiments on ''[[Homo antecessor]]''.{{r|Fantastic Four #577}}
** [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]] later stated that ''Inhomo supremis'' was the product of manipulations on ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'',{{r|Inhumanity #1}} and [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] on early ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 4 8}}
* The Inhumans can be considered a byproduct of the [[Celestials]]' tampering, by sparking a "recessive genetic potential for greatness in the human DNA code".{{r|X-Men Forever #4}}
* It was stated by the [[Kree]] that the Inhumans were of Kree lineage and that they had Kree blood{{r|Inhumans Vol 3 1}} and genes.{{r|Inhumans Vol 3 3}}
** On [[Earth-199999]], the Inhumans were created using Kree blood.{{r|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 3 19}}
| Trivia                  =* When asked if there was a way to distinguish Inhumans from [[Homo superior|mutants]], [[Tom Brevoort|Tom Brevoort]] (presumably joking) stated that all Inhumans were left-handed.<ref>[[Tom Brevoort|Tom Brevoort]]'s [http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/post/87983986028/are-there-any-visual-indicators-to-tell-the-difference response]</ref>
