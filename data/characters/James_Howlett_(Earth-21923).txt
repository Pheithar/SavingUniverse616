<center>''This is an abridged version of Logan's history. For a complete history see '''[[James Howlett (Earth-21923)/Expanded History|Logan's Expanded History]]'''''</center>

===Preface===
This Logan's life was originally presumed to be identical to that of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|the primary iteration of the Wolverine]] and that of his [[James Howlett (Earth-807128)|counterpart]] from [[Earth-807128]]; however, there have since been notable revelations to contradict this erroneous assumption, such as the fact that he recalled fighting in the [[War of 1812]];{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 21}} meanwhile, the Logan of [[Earth-616]] was allegedly born during the 1880s.{{r|Wolverine: The Origin Vol 1 1}} He also recalled raising his daughter, [[Laura Kinney (Earth-21923)|Laura Kinney]].{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 9}} That being said, like his Earth-616 counterpart, this Logan seems to have undergone similar [[Weapon X (Earth-21923)|Weapon X]] experimentation that laced his skeleton with [[Adamantium]].{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 1 4}}{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 1}}{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 9}}

===Wastelands===
====Before the Uprising====
At some point in his history, most likely before the night the heroes fell, Logan spent 20 years in the [[Astral Plane]] before killing the [[Shadow King]].{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 3}}

====Killing the X-Men====
Like his counterpart from Earth-807128, Logan was tricked by [[Quentin Beck (Earth-21923)|Mysterio]] into killing the [[X-Men (Earth-21923)|X-Men]] by using his illusions to make the X-Men look like invading supervillains during the supervillain uprising.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 3}}{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 8}}

[[File:Earth-21923 from Old Man Logan Vol 2 5 001.jpg|thumb|left|Logan roams the Wasteland.]]
====Meeting Maureen====
Logan then roamed the continent of [[North America]] for years, until he arrived at the [[Weapon X Facility]], which was settled by a group of survivors. Thinking that he was a spy of some sort, they beat Logan until [[Maureen Bouchard (Earth-21923)|Maureen]] stepped in and stopped them. She then showed him around their camp and introduced herself to him.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 5}} Logan and Maureen soon developed a romantic relationship, and lived happily until their base was attacked by super-villains, and they were forced to flee to [[Japan]].{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 9}}

However, they were soon kidnapped by a group of ninja called the [[Silent Order (Earth-21923)|Silent Order]], resulting in Logan being stabbed in the neck. This ended up revealing to Maureen that he had regenerative abilities.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 10}} With their interest piqued, the Silent Order ninja took Logan and Maureen to their leaders, [[Sohei (Earth-21923)|Sohei]] and the [[Silent Monk (Earth-21923)|Silent Monk]].{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 11}} Logan, after having the Silent Monk look inside his head, broke free of his restraints, and killed everybody in the Silent Order.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 12}} Maureen was horrified at what Logan had done, but ultimately accepted it because it was for the greater good. She then told him that she wanted to go back to North America and also that she was pregnant.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 12}}

Logan, afraid of what would happen to his new family if his life continued to be filled with violence, promised Maureen that he would never be the Wolverine, or kill, ever again. They then went back to [[Amerika]], and settled down in an abandoned barn in [[California (State)|California]].{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 13}}

====Later Life====
Logan's later life mirrors that of his Earth-807128 counterpart. He married Maureen and had two kids. His family was later killed at the hands of the [[Hulk Gang (Earth-21923)|Hulk Gang]].{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 1}} He then wiped nearly the entire Hulk Gang{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 25}} and its leader [[Bruce Banner (Earth-21923)|Pappy Banner]]{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 29}} and adopted [[Bruce Banner Jr. (Earth-21923)|Bruce Banner Jr.]]{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 1 1}}{{r|Old Man Logan Annual Vol 1 1}}

===[[Secret Wars (2015 Event)|Secret Wars]]===
When the [[Multiverse]] was destroyed and reborn in the form of [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]], Logan ended up in the domain known as the [[Wastelands]], a recreation of [[Earth-21923|his native reality]].{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1}}

After having declared to set his world right, Logan disrupted a poker game between the [[Melvin Potter (Earth-21923)|Gladiator]] and his [[Flying Devils (Earth-21923)|Flying Devils]], and ended their human trafficking ring by killing them, freeing those imprisoned. While on the way back to meet with [[Danielle Cage (Earth-21923)|Danielle Cage]], Logan witnessed a decapitated head of an [[Ultron Sentinel]] fall from above. Wishing to investigate further, he brought it along with him back home to [[Carson City]], where Hulk Jr. and Danielle were also residing. After explaining this new development to her, he carried on to investigate the head's origins. Thanks to a visit to Hammer Falls and meeting with the dying Emma Frost, he found out that it had come from beyond the Wastelands, and decided to venture beyond his domain.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 1 1}}

When Logan trespassed upon its borders, he was approached by a [[Ti Asha Ra (Earth-15513)|Thor]] of the [[Thor Corps (Earth-15513)|Thor Corps]],{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 1 1}} and was attacked by her for breaking [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|God Emperor Doom]]'s laws, falling into the [[Domain of Apocalypse]] in the process. Already healed from the burns caused by the Thor's attack, Logan was attacked by [[Victor Creed (Earth-81589)|Creed]], who was one of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-51518)|Horsemen of Apocalypse]], and his [[Infinites (Earth-51518)|Infinite soldiers]], but was rescued by the [[X-Men (Earth-51518)|X-Men]] and taken to their hideout, where they were attacked by [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-51518)|Apocalypse]] himself and his other Horsemen.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 1 2}}

The battle that ensued was intervened against by the Thor who attacked Logan earlier, and as she had an argument with Apocalypse, Logan fled and hid himself. The Thor then demanded to know to where he had run, but no one answered. Angry, she attacked both the X-Men and the Horsemen of Apocalypse, which made Apocalypse furious, and then went looking for Logan throughout the domain. When she was near the domain's walls, Logan climbed up and attacked her from behind. Enraged, the Thor attacked him with another lightning bolt and let him fall into the neighboring domain, [[Technopolis]], as she was attacked by Apocalypse's Infinite soldiers.

Logan was taken to [[Stark Tower]] by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-12311)|Baron Stark]] and [[James Rhodes (Earth-12311)|Grand Marshal James Rhodes]], the Thor of that domain. After healing his wounds, Logan woke up and found out he was in a totally different domain from the one he expected. He ended up engaging Rhodes in fight, but was defeated and sent to the [[Deadlands (Battleworld)|Deadlands]] as punishment for breaking Doom's laws.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 1 3}}

Thanks to his healing factor, Logan managed to fight through the hordes of [[zombies]] of the Deadlands, taking shelter inside a cave, where he found an uninfected [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-15513)|She-Hulk]], who had been there for a long time. He was trying to convince her to throw him out of the Deadlands when the zombies who were pursuing Logan found them. In a desperate attempt to save Logan's life, She-Hulk caught him and jumped as high as she could to throw him out of the Deadlands as he had suggested, ultimately sacrificing her own life to do so. Afterwards, Logan found himself in the [[Kingdom of Manhattan]].{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 1 4}}

While wandering the city he hadn't seen in years, Logan met this domain's [[Jean Grey (Prime) (Earth-61610)|Jean Grey]] and [[Emma Frost (Prime) (Earth-61610)|Emma Frost]], and was taken by them to met the rest of the [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-61610)|X-Men]], as well as the son of one of the Wolverines of the domain, [[James Hudson Jr. (Earth-61610)|Jimmy Hudson]]. Later, after leading the superhero population of the Kingdom of Manhattan in a rebellion against God Emperor Doom, Logan found himself in a new world.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 1 5}}

===Prime Earth===
====[[Berserker (Story Arc)|Berserker]]====
Logan awoke in the Prime Marvel Universe, an alternate reality set in a similar past to his own. He immediately decided to kill the people responsible for turning his future into what it became, before they had the chance to do so.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 1}} He also chose to remain under the radar, believing it was his destiny to kill the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], something he would do anything to avoid.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Old Man Logan Vol 2 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Logan meets the [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Totally Awesome Hulk]].]]
His first target was [[Black Butcher (Earth-616)|Black Butcher]], a D-list villain that in Logan's future had stolen his son's baseball cap.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 1}} After killing him, Logan remained set up in a workshop to get his bearings, before hearing on the radio that the [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Hulk]] was in [[Manhattan]]. Logan immediately set out to kill him, leading to a fight. Weakened by old age, Logan was no match for a Hulk in the prime of his youth, and failed to kill him. The fight stopped when Logan realized that the Hulk he was fighting was not [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Banner]], but in fact Amadeus Cho. Hurt from the fight and trying to avoid the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|police]], he fled to [[Brooklyn]] and broke into [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Clint Barton]]'s [[Clint Barton's Apartment Building|home]], to get some help. To his dismay, he found [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Kate Bishop]] there instead.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 2}}

After explaining who he was and passing out on Hawkeye's couch, Logan awoke thirty-three hours later. Upon learning that he was looking for [[Francis Klum (Earth-616)|Mysterio]], Bishop looked up his last known whereabouts on [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s database and demanded to come with Logan as he investigated. When they arrived, they found two individuals there. Logan immediately attacked them, cutting off one man's hand, despite them denying that they knew who Mysterio was. A horrified Kate Bishop tried to stop him, but Logan quickly neutralized her, as the two men escaped. Logan gave chase, but was stopped by the arrival of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]].{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 3}}

The two of them confronted each other, until Kate Bishop interfered and fired a tranquilizer arrow at Logan, knocking him unconscious. Waking up in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], Logan was told by Steve that he had something to show him, but Logan thought it was one of Mysterio's illusions and attacked Steve, though he was defeated. Steve later showed the Adamantium-encased corpse of this reality's counterpart, revealing to him that this was not his past, all of which prompted Logan to tell him about the future that he had experienced and how Banner took away his family. Steve offered his help, but Logan refused.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 4}}

[[File:Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|With the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].]]
====Chance at Redemption====
Logan managed to stay under the radar for eight months, but eventually caught the attention of the X-Men and was confronted by [[Cerebra (A.I.) (Earth-616)|Cerebra]]. The team initially believed him to be the late Logan of their universe.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 1}} He initially refused [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]]'s proposal to join her X-Men,{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 2}} but he was finally convinced by the time-displaced [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], who promised to stop him at the slightest chance he'd go down the path he believed he was destined to.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 3}}

====[[Bordertown]]====
After taking a momentary leave, Logan decided to head to [[Killhorn Falls]], where Maureen grew up, but she was still a child. Unbeknownst to Logan, the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]], led by [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]], followed him there in the hopes of subduing him.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 5}} When Logan searched for [[Character Index/M#Maureen|Maureen]]'s missing dog, and discovered its corpse after it had been killed by the Reavers.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 6}} As the Reavers massacred the town, Logan single handedly killed them all and confronted Lady Deathstrike before saving Maureen. Despite being wounded multiple times, Logan managed defeated Deathstrike. As she left, limping, Logan fell unconscious. Realizing that he failed to protect Maureen from the chaos, Logan vowed to hunt down Lady Deathstrike.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 7}}

====Weirdworld====
Logan, alongside with [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]], and [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], was assigned to venture into [[Weirdworld (Battleworld)|Weirdworld]] to bring [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]] to [[X-Haven]]; however, Storm secretly told Logan that if Sunfire didn't comply, he would have to kill him.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 6}} Sunfire did comply though, and went with the X-Men to X-Haven.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 7}}

====[[The Last Ronin]]====
Logan went to a bar in [[Tokyo]] as Patch, where he met a crime lord named Eito. Logan attempted to bribe him for information on Lady Deathstrike's whereabouts, but the meeting turned out to be a ruse. He was gunned down by Eito's henchmen, but he healed and then slaughtered them all. Before he killed Eito, Logan interrogated him and learned that Lady Deathstrike was in a remote village. Logan traveled there, noting that it was where he and Maureen had attempted to find refuge in his past. The village was seemingly abandoned, but he found Yuriko chained to a wall, begging for his help. He was then ambushed by the [[Silent Order (Earth-616)|Silent Order]].{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 9}} Four days later, he awoke in a well and attempted to climb out, but he was shot down by the Order's commander, [[Sohei (Earth-616)|General Sohei]]. Once Logan succeeded in climbing out of the well, he saw he was at a temple and Lady Deathstrike was in a cage. He was then attacked by Sohei and the rest of the Silent Order, ultimately overwhelmed by the horde of ninja, so he had no choice but to free Lady Deathstrike and seek her aid.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 10|11}}

After Logan and Yuriko managed to kill all of the ninja, she attempted to kill Sohei, but was cut down by him, causing her to stumble back into the well. Just as Logan attempted to confront Sohei, he was telekinetically assaulted by his unwitting enforcer, a mutant child called the [[Silent Monk (Earth-616)|Silent Monk]]. The Monk had had a vision of his death in the future and tried to prevent it by killing Logan in the present by throwing him into the well over and over again. Lady Deathstrike threw an arrow into the Silent Monk's thigh, causing him to fall into the well as well and Logan then threatened to kill the young mutant unless Sohei released him and Yuriko.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 12}} Sohei called Logan's bluff, but knew that Yuriko was more than willing to murder a helpless child. Sohei agreed to their demands just as the Silent Monk regained consciousness and lashed out. The Monk transformed into a giant creature as his powers ran wild. Logan convinced the young boy to read his mind, assuring the Monk that Logan's future will never likely come true. The young boy then realized that Sohei had been manipulating him and subdued Sohei and the remaining Silent Order ninja. Logan offered to take the Silent Monk to X-Haven, an offer that he accepted.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 9|13}}

====[[Return to the Wastelands]]====
One day, Logan woke up in the Wastelands, and was eaten by a [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-21923)|Venom]]-possessed T-Rex. Logan then popped his claws, and tore his way out of the beast's stomach. He then hopped onto his horse, and tried to remember how he got back to the Wastelands. He recalled receiving a distress signal from the [[Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] space station by [[Eugene Judd (Earth-616)|Puck]]. He then remembered being ambushed by a [[Brood (Race)|Brood]]. He then travelled to Danielle Cage's house in Las Vegas. He then discovered Danielle Cage in her closer, tied and gagged. He freed her, and she told him that [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-21923)|Kang]] had capture Bruce Jr. Logan, still trying to figure out how he got back to the Wastelands, continued to recollect his time on the Alpha Flight space station. He recalled almost being infected by the Brood-controlled [[Walter Langkowski (Earth-616)|Sasquatch]] and [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]]. However, he was saved by Puck, and the two retreat to a panic room. Back in the present, Logan set out to save Bruce Banner Jr, and told Danielle Cage that what happened wasn't her fault. Logan then remembered that when he was on the Alpha Flight space station, he was sucked into the vacuum of space.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 16}}

In the Wastelands, Logan was attacked by the [[Wrecking Crew]] and tossed off of [[Niagara Falls]]. Logan then entered a cave hidden behind the waterfalls before flashing back to the Alpha Flight space station again, remembering that Puck had saved him. Logan, after experiencing an of Bruce Banner Jr. becoming a dictator, realized that [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] was playing psychic mind tricks on him, and that he hadn't actually gone back to the Wastelands.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 17}}

After experiencing more illusions of a false Bruce Banner Jr, in addition to reanimated corpses of his family and his universe's X-Men, Logan broke free of the illusions long enough for him to kill the Brood embryo controlling Jean. She then telepathically shut down all the Brood, and the infected members of the space station were taken to be cured. Jean tried to apologize for what she did while controlled by Brood, but Logan told her that it was fine, and that she made him realized that he had to go back to the Wastelands.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 18}}

====[[Civil War II]]====
=====[[Box (Story Arc)|The Box]]=====
At some point, [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Director Maria Hill]] enlisted Logan's help in investigating the disappearance of her S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 8}} [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] later on saved him from being digested by [[Fin Fang Foom (Earth-616)|Fin Fang Foom]]. She asked [[Gabrielle Kinney (Earth-616)|Gabby]] to take him somewhere safe; meanwhile, she covered herself in the [[Makluans]]' pheromone and used it to lure an amorous Foom out to sea. Laura was distressed when she returned [[Laura Kinney's Apartment|home]] that evening to discover that Gabby brought Logan there to recover, as she adamantly refused to accept that he was her Logan; however, Logan awoke and struck her speechless when he revealed that he recognized the apartment, as it was where he'd raised [[Laura Kinney (Earth-21923)|her]].{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 9}} Elsewhere, a precognitive [[Human-Inhuman Hybrids|NuHuman]], [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses]], predicted that Logan would kill Gabby, and warned [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol Danvers]], who contacted Maria Hill with the information.{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 10}}

=====[[Destiny (Story Arc)|Destiny]]=====
[[File:All-New Wolverine Vol 1 12 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Encountering [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|Laura]] and [[Gabrielle Kinney (Earth-616)|Gabby]].]]
Back at the apartment, Logan had woken again, confused about where he was, and why he heard whale noises. Gabby told him it was to help soothe him, and as Laura untied him he told her that he smelt somebody coming up their fire escape. He popped his claws on instinct, prepared to fight, but Laura talked him down. Two burglars, one armed with a handgun, entered the apartment through the window. Gabby's pet wolverine, [[Jonathan (Earth-616)|Jonathan]], was shot in the ensuing encounter, and she, along with Laura and Logan, easily subdued the two robbers. Logan and Gabby then patched up Jonathan, and Logan asked if she had harmful intent towards Laura. After Gabby told him she didn't, he said that he was proud of her and went to get a soda. After revealing to Laura that he didn't raise her in this apartment, but he did still raise her, he told her that she was one of the only things that he didn't regret. He then tried to talk to her about what happened between her and [[Gabrielle Kinney (Earth-21923)|Gabby]] in his future, but Laura refused to listen. Maria Hill then called her, and told her that Logan was going to kill Gabby, while a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, including [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America]], came to arrest him.{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 10}}

Laura, not believing in preemptive justice, fought against Captain America as Logan and Gabby thought of an escape plan in another room. Gabby grabbed two [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Flight Pack]]s, one for her and one for Logan, and followed Logan as he cut holes through the apartment complex's walls until they were outside; however, Maria Hill had a [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]] shoot Logan in the back with an on-board energy weapon, destroying his jetpack and making him crash into [[Bethesda Terrace and Fountain]] in [[Central Park]]. As a van full of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents arrived on the scene, Logan, driven to the point of a berserker rage, took down the squadron of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as he was shot by multiple tranquilizers. Gabby, in an attempt to calm Logan down, tried talking to him; however, due to the hallucinogenic state he was in, Logan stabbed Gabby through the chest, telling her that in his universe, she killed Laura.{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 11}}

Logan, still in his crazed state, then tried to attack Captain America, who hit him in the face with his shield, knocking him out. Cap then called for the S.H.I.E.L.D. medic's assistance, as Laura mourned Gabby's "death." Logan escaped into the sewers during all of the commotion, and Laura pursued him. Laura then used her enhanced senses to track down a berserk Logan, who lunged at her and instigated a fight. Unknown to Logan and Laura, Gabby bolted up, due to her hidden regenerative abilities, and looked for Laura and Logan. Laura continued to fight Logan, until he left his berserker state; however, in a fit of anger, Laura almost killed him anyway, but wais stopped by Gabby, who revealed her hidden powers and claws to Laura and Logan. Laura asked Logan if he knew that Gabby could heal, and he responded that he wasn't sure, and that Laura and Gabby killed each other in his world. Angry, Laura then blew up on Logan, asking if there was anybody in Logan's world who didn't die for knowing him, and threatened to get him thrown into prison if he came near her or Gabby again. As Gabby apologized for everything that'd happened, Logan told her, "You hurt her, and I will come for you." Gabby threatened him in return, then Laura and Gabby told Steve Rogers that they wouldn't have any further part in [[Civil War II|the second superhuman civil war]].{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 12}}

Logan ultimately fought alongside [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and his team against preemptive justice until the conclusion of the second superhuman civil war.{{r|Civil War II #5}}

[[File:X-Men Gold Vol 2 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Logan alongside [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]]'s team of [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].]]
====[[Back to the Basics]]====
After [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|the war between the Inhumans and the X-Men]], Logan joined [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]]'s team of X-Men alongside Nightcrawler, [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Prestige]], Colossus, and Storm. The team was dispatched to take down [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax]], who was wreaking havoc on New York City. One Logan, Storm, and Prestige beat Terrax, the X-Men regrouped, only to see a crowd of shocked humans standing around them. After Kitty tries reasoning with them, the X-Men head back to their base of operations in Central Park, [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]]. Later, Logan aided the X-Men when the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood]] attacked the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations Headquarters]] in [[Manhattan]].{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 1}} Seemingly leading this team was [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]]. When Logan questioned why she was leading the Brotherhood, she responded by setting him on fire. Nightcrawler tried to teleport him to safety, only to be kind-controlled, letting Logan get captured by [[Mesmero (Vincent) (Earth-616)|Mesmero]], as the X-Men battle the Brotherhood, who fled the battle.

When Logan woke up, he discovered that he had been chained to a wooden chair by Adamantium. He was able to smell Mesmero, and told him that he had one chance to alter his mind before he broke free. Mesmero was unable to affect Logan's mind due to his psychic resistance, prompting him to break out of his chair and choke Mesmero with the chains that bound him. After taking on a couple of members of the Brotherhood, Logan called Kitty Pryde, revealing to her the location of the Brotherhood's hideout so the X-Men could beat the Brotherhood and save the mayor.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 2}} Logan was then overwhelmed, and Mesmero broke through his psychic shields. The X-Men, along with students [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]] and [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]], assault the Brotherhood's hideout, battling them and a brainwashed Logan. Logan is eventually knocked out by a lightning bolt from Storm, and broken free of Mesmero's control. Learning that the base has two minutes until it explodes, the X-Men evacuate as Kitty Pryde tries to find Magma. The base then explodes with Kitty and Magma still inside, but the two survive thanks to Kitty's abilities. After learning that everybody in the the Brotherhood was under the control of Mesmero due to [[Lydia Nance (Earth-616)|Lydia Nance]], an anti-mutant activist, hiring him to make mutants look bad, the team takes a mysterious member of the Brotherhood, [[Kologoth Antares (Earth-616)|Kologoth]], in to see if he recalls anything about his time in the Brotherhood. The X-Men then infiltrated the home of Lydia Nance, and warned her that if she tries anything again, they'll come after her.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 3}}

[[File:James Howlett (Earth-21923) and Victor Creed (Earth-616) vs. Weapon X (Earth-616) from Weapon X Vol 3 2 001.png|thumb|right|Logan and [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] fighting the [[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X Program]]'s Adamantium cyborgs.]]
While spending some alone time in the woods, Logan was attacked by [[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X]] cyborgs, forcing him to team up with [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] to confront the current iteration of the organization, whose goal was to hunt mutantkind to extinction.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 1}} After retreating from battle with the Weapon X cyborgs, Logan and Sabretooth lured one of them into a trap, accidentally killing it, before tracking two of the cyborg's comrades.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 2}} Logan and Victor took a break to get coffee and doughnuts, before figuring out that they rented a car to travel. Creed and Logan then supplied themselves with firearms and used a tracking device in the car rented by the cyborgs to deduce that their next target was [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]], and went to aid her in a fight against the cyborgs on a boat near [[Isla Cedros]], [[Baja California]].

[[File:Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 19 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Logan with Sabretooth and the Totally Awesome Hulk.]]
After defeating the cyborgs,{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 3}} Logan searched the area for their remains, finding a chip that could be used to track the source of the cyborgs. Soon after, the [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Hulk]], who had also been attacked by Weapon X cyborgs, picked them up, offering his assistance and alerting them to the fact that [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]] and [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]] had been kidnapped for their technology and genetics, respectively. Hulk then proceeded to hack into the cyborg's data bank, locating its point of origin, only to have Logan figure out that Weapon X had gotten its hands on a DNA sample from the Hulk.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 19}} Soon after this discovery, Hulk, Logan, Sabretooth, and Domino leapt out of an aircraft from two hundred feet over a Weapon X facility in [[Louisiana (State)|Louisiana]] to save Lady Deathstroke and Warpath from captivity. After fighting through a horde of cyborgs, the team rescued Warpath and Lady Deathstrike before trying to interrogate the scientists of the facility. Before they got the chance to get any information, however, [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|William Stryker]] (the new director of the Weapon X Program) had the facility blown up, with only Logan and his companions surviving the blast.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 4}}

Afterwards, Logan warned Kitty Pryde about the Weapon X cyborgs, and to have Cerebra keep an eye on the Mutant population. When she asked if Logan needed any help from an X-Man such as Colossus, he declined stating that he already had a team in place. He then engaged in a training session where he ambushed Creed and Yuriko. He told them that they all needed to learn how to work together. Sabretooth then instigated a fight between with Domino and Warpath, which the latter won. After finding a lead thanks to Logan and the Hulk, the team split into two groups: Hulk and Yuriko would go hunt the family of one of the cyborgs, and the rest of the team going to a Weapon X manufacturing facility in [[Oklahoma (State)|Oklahoma]]. Once Logan's team entered the building, they were attacked by cyborgs disguised as stray cats. After beating their enemies, Logan found shipping manifests.{{r|Weapons of Mutant Destruction: Alpha Vol 1 1}} Soon after, Logan and his team briefly investigates a Mutant murder in [[Santo Marco]].{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 20}}

After being filled in on the fact that the recovered shipping manifests were altered, Logan and Sabretooth tracked down one of Weapon X's accountants to his apartment, where they tried to question him. But before they could get any information, Weapon X killed him. With the help of Amadeus Cho, they located Weapon X's main facility in Texas.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 5}} After debating with Cho whether or not they should bomb the facility, Sabretooth and Amadeus got into a fight, which Logan allowed to happen. After the Hulk beat Sabretooth, the rest of the team agreed to go with Amadeus' plan of attacking the base head-on. They then started their assault on the base at night, ready for a war.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 21}}

[[File:Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 22 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|[[Weapon X-Force (Earth-616)|Weapon X]] vs. [[Clayton Cortez (Earth-616)|Weapon H]].]]
The team proceeded to raid the base, fighting through waves of cyborgs, and failed experiments, until encountering [[Robert Andrews (Earth-616)|H-Beta]], another failed attempt to merge the Hulk's DNA with the rest of the team's DNA. Amadeus fought this monster, only lasting by giving into the Hulk persona. After finishing his incubation, [[Clayton Cortez (Earth-616)|H-Alpha, a.k.a. Weapon H]], was unleashed by Weapon X and killed H-Beta. The facility was soon destroyed in a battle between Weapon X, Cho, Weapon H, and Logan's team. Weapon H determined that there were no threats in the area, running away from the chaos. Weapon X then retreated and took his creator, [[Aliana Alba (Earth-616)|Dr. Alba]] and Amadeus left in a fit of rage, leaving Logan's team alone in the wreckage. Sabretooth then declared that him, Logan, Warpath, Lady Deathstrike and Domino banded together to become [[Weapon X-Force (Earth-616)|the new Weapon X]], and set off to take down Weapon H.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 22}}

====[[The Hunt for Weapon H]]====
Later, as Logan and the rest of Weapon X tracked Weapon H across the American southwest, Logan and the rest of the team had a dispute, Logan wanting to try to reason with Weapon H, and the rest of the team wanting to kill him. Eventually, they tracked Weapon H down, and Logan told Weapon H he has one minute to try to calm him down, per an agreement he made with the rest of the team.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 7}} Despite this, Weapon H ignored him, and proceeded to attack them, in the following order; Warpath, Lady Deathstrike, Sabretooth and Logan. He quickly dispatched them and fled, ignoring Domino, who laid them in the Medbay. Logan then found out that Weapon H was taking on the team based on how dangerous they were, meaning that Weapon H was capable of holding back, but mistook the team for enemies.

[[File:Weapon X Vol 3 9 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Logan and Laura.]]
After tracking Weapon H to northern Wyoming, Sabretooth attacked Logan, trying to usurp leadership of Weapon X. However, [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] stopped him.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 8}} After she beat Sabretooth, she was filled in on everything that had happened in relation to Weapon X and Weapon H. When Logan, Laura, Sabretooth, and Warpath located Weapon H, they realized that Weapon H had amnesia. Stryker then ordered an assault on the location. Afterward, Dr. Alba seemingly whispered something in Weapon H's ear that made him hulk-out, kill all the Weapon X cyborgs sent after him, mutilate Stryker, and free her. After arriving at where they thought Weapon H was too late, Sabretooth blamed their recent failures on Logan, and tried to engage in a fight with him. However, Laura discovered that Stryker himself was an adamantium cyborg. Too damaged to move, Stryker told her that he'll tell Logan and his team everything they needed to know in order to defeat Weapon H.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 9}}

====[[Scarlet Samurai (Story Arc)|Scarlet Samurai]]====
[[File:Old Man Logan Vol 2 33 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Logan and the Scarlet Samurai.]]
After quitting the X-Men for a while,{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 21}} Logan, missing the bustling streets of Tokyo, decided to visit and get a few drinks in Kabukicho, Tokyo, only to witness a man getting thrown through the window of a bar by members of the [[Crazy Thunder Clan (Earth-616)|Crazy Thunder Clan]] for refusing to buy drinks for them in “their territory.” Logan, looking to resolve the conflict peacefully, offered to pay for their drinks, only to get attacked for not minding his own business. Logan, outclassing the thugs, proceeded to easily sever limbs from the members of the clan. However, he then discovered that the criminals had obtained healing factors from a drug called [[Regenix]]. Investigating further, Logan travelled to a drug smuggling den in Ikebukuro. Logan, wanting information on the drug, threatened the leader of the den for information, leading to him and various other members of the Crazy Thunder Clan to attack him. Eventually, the battle between the clan members and Logan led to a freezer in the building, where Logan discovered that the regeneration gained from Regenix was slowed in the cold. Logan then interrogated the head of the den, learning that the drug “Regenix” was produced by a scientist named [[Touko Kenmochi (Earth-616)|Touko Kenmochi]], along with where the creator of the drug lived.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 31}}

The next day, Logan attended the funeral of Touko, and made arrangements with his widow Asami to meet up at a bar to help him with his investigation. He then learned that Regenix was produced to help people, but when the Crazy Thunder Gang found out, they forced Touko to bring them samples. However, the two’s conversation was interrupted when [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]], [[Mariko Yashida (Earth-616)|the Scarlet Samurai]], and the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] intervened. Two Hand ninjas then attempted to kidnap Asami, and Logan went to attack Gorgon, but was subsequently overwhelmed by the combined forces of him, the Hand, and the Scarlet Samurai, who cut off his hand using her advanced sword. However, before she killed Logan Gorgon ordered her to remove her helmet, revealing herself to be a Hand-resurrected Mariko.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 32}}

However, Mariko recognized Logan as part of her past life, and hesitated before killing, giving Logan and Asami the opportunity to escape. Logan and Asami then went their separate ways as Logan hid at a pier to recover from his injuries. As he was regenerating his severed hand and claws (albeit without its Adamantium coat), Logan was approached by [[Shingen Harada II (Earth-616)|the second Silver Samurai]], seeking to ally himself with Logan. Logan then agreed to this, but only under the terms that Touko’s child would be taken care of and that he wouldn’t kill Mariko. Soon, Logan and the Silver Samurai raided the Hand’s Regenix manufacturing in the Yashida Corp, and used liquid nitrogen to slow the regeneration the Hand had obtained from the drug. Silver Samurai then proceeded to combat Gorgon, as Logan fought off Hand ninjas and tried to get through to Mariko. However, Logan refused to harm Mariko and was almost slain by her. Luckily, Gorgon chose to retreat from the battle, allowing Silver Samurai to inject Mariko with nanites that would break the Hand's control over her. Then, since Logan and Mariko owed him a favor, Silver Samurai had the two go to Madripoor to destroy a rogue shipment of Regenix.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 33}}

Now in Madripoor, Logan was still feeling weak from his previous injuries which surprised Mariko, however despite his weakened state he decided to help Mariko take down Gorgon. The duo was then able to destroy the last batch of Regenix before facing Gorgon.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 34}} Gorgon was able to stab Logan through the chest with a sword but Logan also managed to severely wounded him with his claws. Mariko, angry about what Gorgon did to her and about what he just did to Logan, confronted him. She was able to defeat him but as she was about to kill him, he was saved by his ninja army and was able to escape. Logan's wounds overwhelmed his healing factor and as he was about to die, Mariko decided to inject him with the Regenix, saving his life. After checking on Silver Samurai to make sure he stopped the production of Regenix, she then gave Logan the last remaining doses of Regenix and told him to use them in case of emergency. 

After thanking Logan, Mariko, now free from the Hand's control and from her old obligations with the Clan Yashida said her goodbyes to the old man, and decided to rediscover the world after being gone for so long.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 35}}

====[[Moving Target]]====
[[File: Old Man Logan Vol 2 36 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Logan targeted by Bullseye]]
Back in Manhattan, Logan discovered that [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Wilson Fisk a.k.a the Kingpin]] was now the new Mayor of [[New York City]], which reminded him of his own reality and how the villains took over the world. While he was drinking alone in a bar, a young man named Nicky followed him and asked for his help, saying he had informations that could take down Wilson Fisk. Logan accepted to help him, and discovered that Nicky used to work for Wilson Fisk, and that the informations that could ruined Fisk's life were stored on an encrypted Flash drive and he needed Logan's help to decrypt it.

But Fisk learned about Nicky's plan and sent several of his hitmen after him, they killed Nicky in front of Logan's eyes and tried to recover the flash drive but Logan decided to fight against them. Despite defeating them and recovering the drive, Logan was wounded during the fight by several bullets and discovered that his healing factor was now working even slower than before to the point he needed to go to a drugstore in order to find something to help him healed. After leaving the drugstore, he decided to pay a visit to someone who knew Fisk's little secrets and who could help him: [[Sarah Dewey (Earth-616)|Sarah Dewey]].

But Fisk wasn't done and after the failure of his hitmen to secure the drive he decided to send his best killer after Logan: [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]].{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 36}}

[[File: Old Man Logan Vol 2 37 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Logan facing Bullseye]]
Logan later found Sarah and after he explained the situation to her, she agreed to help him, but unknown to the duo, Bullseye also found them and decided to use several herbal scents to gum up Logan's sense before attacking him at a grocery store in Manhattan. The fight was brutal resulting in Logan losing his left eye and his left eardrum, the fight over, Bullseye discovered that Logan gave the drive to Sarah and was just fighting him to let her escape. But unfortunately Bullseye was able to catch her and he recovered the drive.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 37}}

After making sure that Sarah was okay, Logan went after Bullseye and this time defeated him before taking both Bullseye's body and the drive to Fisk in order to know more. Once at Fisk's office, the villain showed Logan that the drive only contained pictures and videos about his time with his deceased wife, [[Vanessa Fisk (Earth-616)|Vanessa]]. Despite wanted to make Fisk paid for the death of Nicky, Logan had no choice but to let Fisk go free after he threatened to go after Sarah and destroyed her life. Logan then went to see Sarah to make sure she was okay before leaving her, telling her to take of herself and her children.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 38}}

====[[Glob Loves, Man Kills]]====
[[File: Old Man Logan Vol 2 40 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Logan teaming up with Glob]]
In order to investigate why his healing factor weakened all of sudden, Logan headed back to the X-Mansion where he was welcomed by [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]], [[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob]], [[Iara Dos Santos (Earth-616)|Shark-Girl]], and [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]] who were happy to see him and told him that Glob finally got a date with a girl named Sasha. Logan then saw [[Cecilia Reyes (Earth-616)|Cecilia Reyes]] who took him to the infirmary in order to run some tests. The tests over, she confirmed that from now on, his weakened condition would be "the new normal" for him.

As Logan was about to leave the mansion, Shark Girl, Rockslide and Anole convinced him to stay a little longer until Glob came back from his date. Unfortunately for Glob, his date with Sasha was a trap, and now the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] intended to use him as a suicide bomber in order to blow up the doors of the X-mansion or they would kill Sasha.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 39}}

When Glob came back to the mansion, Logan understood that something wasn't right and after Glob was forced to blow up the entrance of the school, the Purifiers decided to attack. After explaining the situation to Logan, they decided to stop the attack but in the midst of the battle Glob discovered that Sasha was never a mutant but a purifier all along and she only wanted to use him to kill mutants. Thanks to the help of his friends, Logan and Cecilia, Glob was able to save the day. The crisis now averted, Logan went back on the road.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 40}}

====[[Logan the Hunted]]====
[[File: Old Man Logan Vol 2 41 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Logan hunted by Kraven]]
Not long after, Logan was attacked in [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]] by two old foes: [[Bloodscream (Earth-616)|Bloodscream]] and [[Roughouse (Earth-616)|Roughouse]]. Despite being able to handle his own against them, they finally got the better of him by distracting him long enough to be captured by [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]].

Kraven always considered [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] to be the apex predator of this world and always wanted to hunt him. But after recovering Logan's severed adamantium hand and claw in Japan, Kraven understood that Logan was now sick and that he could never proved his superiority to Logan in his prime. To that end he decided to give him a glorious death as respect for the man Logan used to be, he then dropped Logan in the [[Savage Land]] and gave him a 4 hours head start before hunting him.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 41}}

Despite his weakened healing factor and the several dangerous creatures of the Savage Land, Logan was able to outsmart Kraven and defeat him. After meeting with [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]] and explaining the situation to him, Logan headed back to Kraven's plane and left the Savage Land. But despite this victory, Logan knew that Kraven was right, he was dying. But Logan didn't want to die yet and not in this reality, he understood that he needed to go back to the Wastelands.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 42}}

====[[Bullseye Returns]]====
[[File: Old Man Logan Vol 2 43 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Bullseye ready to get his revenge on Logan]]
Back in New York, Logan discovered that Sarah Dewey had been murdered by Bullseye as revenge for helping Logan against him previously. At the crime scene, Logan met [[Joy Jones (Earth-616)|Joy Jones a.k.a Vendetta]] who was after Bullseye after he killed [[Timothy Jones (FBI) (Earth-616)|her husband]], and they decided to track Bullseye together.

During their investigation they found Bullseye's agent who told them that Bullseye had been more and more unstable since Logan defeated him. Before they could learn more, Bullseye killed his agent and almost killed Logan and Joy in an explosion. The duo escaped just in time and discovered that Bullseye killed several innocent people and warned Logan that he was next.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 43}}

The duo resumed their search, Joy decided to contact [[Buck Cashman (Earth-616)|Bullet]] and [[J. R. Walker (Earth-616)|Shotgun]], two mercenaries she hired some time ago to go after Bullseye in order to warn them. But it was too late, Bullseye already got to Bullet, tortured him and threatened him that he was going to kidnap [[Lance Cashman (Earth-616)|his son]]. Bullet agreed to help Logan and Joy if they rescued his son first, to that end Logan contacted Glob and told him to find Bullet's son at his school and saved him.

The duo then went to Shotgun's location who was attacked by Bullseye, Logan quickly rushed to Bullseye and severely beat him down but Bullseye was able to escape. Joy and Logan decided to team up with Shotgun and go after Bullseye but at the same time, Glob called Logan to tell him that Bullseye already kidnapped Bullet's son.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 44}}

[[File: Old Man Logan Vol 2 44 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Logan is now Bullseye's main target]]
The trio managed to corner Bullseye in an old abandoned factory in Helmetta, New Jersey, where Logan was able to catch Bullseye and threatened to kill him if he didn't tell them the location of Bullet's son. Bullseye agreed and gave them the location, Logan quickly called Glob and gave him the address, but once Glob arrived he discovered with horror that Bullseye already killed Bullet's son.

Angry about this reveal, Logan was about to kill Bullseye, but Bullseye was able to kick Logan away, he then stole Joy's gun and shot Logan with it. Bullseye then tried to escape by jumping through a window but he was shot in mid-air by Joy and crashed to the ground where Shotgun was waiting to finish him off. But the cops arrived and arrested Shotgun, Bullseye, and Logan.

Logan then woke up at the hospital with Joy at his side, she freed him and Logan escaped through the window and rejoined Glob who was waiting for him in a car nearby.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 45}}

====[[Northern Flight]]====
[[File: Old Man Logan Vol 2 46 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Logan ready to face the creature from the blackest of space]]
Not long after, Logan headed to Canada to meet his old friends from [[Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]], he then went to see [[Michael Twoyoungmen (Earth-616)|Shaman]] in order to have a second opinion about his physical condition. Shaman revealed to Logan that the Adamantium coating his bones was now poisoning him as the Adamantium surpassed its half-life and was now breaking down, releasing more and more toxins in Logan's system. But Shaman also revealed that the Regenix in Logan's system was also taxing his body beyond what it was capable of recovering from, to the point his body was going to break soon and there was nothing to do.

Despite this news, Logan still decided to help Alpha Flight investigate the reports of an unidentified object that landed in Canada near the coast, but once they arrived at Shag Harbour, they discovered that the 500 residents that used to live here disappeared and the whole town was now covered with several strange purple vines. After discovering the source of the vines and the dead bodies of several residents of Shag Harbour, the team was attacked by the vines which were now growing into something really big.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 46}}

In the midst of the battle, Shaman was connected to the creature and discovered that the fire was its weakness. With the help of several survivors of Shag Harbour and Alpha Flight, Logan was able to expose the creature's weak point and burn it which killed it once and for all. The crisis averted, and after recovering from the burns he sustained during this fight, Puck told Logan that he finally found the one monster Logan was after: The Maestro. After learning that Logan was dying, Puck told Logan that he wanted to help him against Maestro but Logan refused saying he needed to face him on his own. After bidding farewell to Alpha Fight, Logan decided to go after the Maestro one last time.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 47}}

====[[King of Nothing]]====
[[File: Old Man Logan Vol 2 48 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Logan and Maestro final showdown]]
Logan then headed to Fort Wells in the [[Northwest Territories]] of Canada where the Maestro proclaimed himself as a King and was terrorizing the inhabitants and killing everyone who tried to escape. In order to enter the city, Logan let himself get captured, once inside he met a young kid named Joshua who explained to him that no one could escape the city before trying to free him. 

But several guards arrived in order to take Logan to the Maestro, but on the way Logan discovered with horror the number of people butchered by the Maestro and how he enslaved the rest of them. After Logan was brought to the Maestro, he tried to fight him and despite putting on a brave fight, Logan quickly understood that he underestimated the Maestro who defeated him and almost killed him.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 48}}

Thinking he was dead, the Maestro ordered his men to bury Logan with the rest of the people he already killed, but despite his weakened healing factor, Logan came back to life 5 days later, he was then rescued by Joshua. Joshua was then able to recover Logan's clothes and the Regenix dose he kept with him. But soon after they witnessed a public execution, Joshua and Logan were found by the Maestro's men who killed Joshua and shot Logan who fell through a window just in front of the Maestro.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 49}}

Facing the Maestro once again, Logan tried to gain some time in order to inject himself with the Regenix by telling him that he was a coward and a King of nothing, he was just pathetic which angered the Maestro who violently punched Logan before he could use the Regenix. With the Regenix lost, the Maestro once again severely beat Logan down and chained him. But before losing consciousness, Logan saw a little girl picking up his Regenix dose.

Despite Logan being in chains, the Maestro was still shocked by Logan's words but he quickly learned from one of his men that Logan was after [[Time Platform|his time-travel machine]] that allowed him to come to this reality in the first place. Back to Logan, Angela one of the citizen who has had enough of the Maestro's reign of terror, decided to help Logan, Logan then told her to retrieve the Regenix so he could face the Maestro one last time.

[[File: Old Man Logan Vol 2 50 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|End of the line for Old Man Logan]]
The Maestro then decided to torture Logan in front of the whole city to make an example out of him but Angela who was able to retrieve the Regenix saved him with the help of several other citizen, she then injected the Regenix in Logan's heart. Feeling like his old self once again, Logan faced the Maestro who decided to run and lure Logan to a cave where his time-travel machine was located. The Maestro then told Logan he could send him home but Logan told him to go to his own reality first. Disappointed by Logan's answer, the Maestro decided to destroy the Machine while mocking Logan.

Angry by what the Maestro just did, Logan faced him in a ferocious battle. As he was feeling the Regenix in his body falling, the Maestro jumped ready to smash Logan once and for all, but as the Maestro was falling on him Logan quickly jumped and beheaded the Maestro with his claws. His foe finally defeated, Logan felt that the Regenix took its toll on his body and he fell to the ground, unconscious.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 50}}

====[[Sins of the Father]]====
[[File: Dead Man Logan Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|right|Dead Man Logan]]
After his fight with the Maestro, Logan was quickly found by [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]], Jubilee, Cecilia, and Glob who took him back to the X-Mansion alongside the body and head of the Maestro. 11 days later, Logan finally woke up and Cecilia told him that his healing factor was currently trying to prevent the Regenix in his body from destroying his organs while also fighting the Adamantium poisoning. She then told Logan that he only had 12 months to live, knowing he didn't have much time anymore, Logan decided to tie up some loose ends starting with the man that ruined his life: [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]].

To that end, Logan went to the [[Bar with No Name]] where he beat down several villains in order to learn the location of Mysterio but it was a dead end and after meeting [[Claudine Renko (Earth-616)|Miss Sinister]] along the way, Logan resumed his investigation and went to an old warehouse that Mysterio used as a hideout. But Mysterio wasn't there, instead Logan found Hawkeye who told him that he knew Mysterio's location thanks to [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], but before telling Logan he wanted to know why Logan was after him. After explaining what Mysterio did to him in his timeline and how he wanted to make sure it wouldn't happen here too, Hawkeye agreed to help him.

But Miss Sinister was able to find Mysterio in [[Bedford Hills Psychiatric Hospital]] where he was hiding and living peacefully, before Logan and Hawkeye. She decided to help him after she saw in Logan's mind what Mysterio did to him in his timeline and how he could usher a new era without any superhero. After recovering his costume, she then took him to [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Sin]] and [[Brock Rumlow (Earth-616)|Crossbones]] and their New [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Neo-Hydra organization]].{{r|Dead Man Logan Vol 1 1}}

[[File: Dead Man Logan Vol 1 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Logan going after Mysterio]]
After running into several dead ends, Logan revealed to Hawkeye that just after he arrived in this reality he made sure that the X-Men had a fail-safe to shut him down in case he went rogue, the reason he was hunting Mysterio was because he feared that Mysterio could do what he did to him to another hero. Logan then went back to the mansion after receiving a call from Glob where he discovered that Forge repaired the Maestro's time travel machine. Forge then took Logan, Hawkeye and Glob to the Wastelands, Logan was shocked he was finally home. But before he could go home, he needed to finish his business with Mysterio. 

After fighting several villains, Logan and Hawkeye finally discovered Mysterio's location in [[Times Square]]. Once they arrived to his location, Logan saw that Mysterio was surrounded by other villains, so he decided to inject himself with a dose of Regenix and attacked them. But it was a trap, and instead of fighting Mysterio and several villains, Logan was now facing the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Dead Man Logan Vol 1 2}}

While Logan was fighting the Avengers, Mysterio discovered that after helping the Red Skull win the war against the superheroes in Logan's reality, his alternate self was killed under the orders of the Red Skull. He also learned that Sin and Miss Sinister intended to kill him too after they were done with him. After this reveal, Mysterio decided to switch sides and helped Logan take down Neo-Hydra.

[[File: Dead Man Logan Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Logan facing the Avengers]]
Back to the fight with the Avengers, Logan was able to hold his own against the Avengers but after the X-Men saw what was happening on TV they used their fail-safe and shut Logan down, putting an end to this fight. The X-Men then took Logan back and Hawkeye decided to go with them to keep an eye on him in case Mysterio tried to control him again.{{r|Dead Man Logan Vol 1 3}}

Mysterio then quickly found Hawkeye at his [[Clint Barton's Apartment Building|Apartment Building]] and asked for his help after explaining that Sin and Miss Sinister intended to kill him, despite being reluctant at first Hawkeye agreed to help Mysterio and took him to Forge's laboratory. At the laboratory, Cecilia discovered that Logan's healing factor had slowed considerably after he used the Regenix to the point, he only had 6 months to live now. Each time he would take another dose of Regenix, it would halve that time.

As Logan was feeling angry about himself about what just happened, Mysterio and Hawkeye just came to see him, and as expected Logan attacked Mysterio on sight. But Hawkeye convinced him that Mysterio only wanted to help them, Logan agreed to hold off on killing him. Mysterio then showed Logan, Hawkeye, and the X-Men the location of Neo-Hydra HQ.{{r|Dead Man Logan Vol 1 4}}

With the help of Mysterio, Logan, the X-Men and Hawkeye were able to take down Neo-Hydra, Sin, Crossbones, and Miss Sinister. In the midst of the battle, as Logan was able to inject himself with another dose of Regenix he was shot several times by Sin and had to lay down in order to recover. While he was recovering, Mysterio came back and started to taunt him, saying he was pathetic but using his last forces Logan was able to get back on his feet and killed Mysterio. 

With Neo-Hydra defeated and with Mysterio dead, Logan, Hawkeye and the X-Men decided to leave with Sin and Miss Sinister in their custody. Logan then told Forge he had one last thing to do before going back to the Wastelands.

Unknown to Logan, Hawkeye and the X-Men, Mysterio wasn't dead, he used an illusion to make Logan think he killed him but in truth he only killed a Neo-Hydra soldier. Now believed to be dead, Mysterio decided to return to the Bedford Hills Psychiatric Hospital to be alone and to never leave this place ever again.{{r|Dead Man Logan Vol 1 5}}

====One Last Goodbye====
[[File: Dead Man Logan Vol 1 6 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Old Man Logan and Wolverine finally meeting.]]
Before going back to the Wastelands, Logan decided to say his goodbyes to [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]] and asked for his forgiveness for what happened previously. Steve accepted Logan's apology and told him to stay safe, Logan then decided to go to [[Vancouver]] where Mariko was now living. Now at Mariko's apartment she explained to him that she was now trying to live a normal life and as much as it pained her she needed to stay away from people like him.

Logan understood and only asked her a favor, he wanted her to take care of a little girl named [[Maureen Bouchard (Earth-616)|Maureen Bouchard]]. He explained to her that 50 years in the future, Maureen was [[Maureen Bouchard (Earth-21923)|his wife]] and he was still blaming himself for her death, so to make amends of his past actions and to make sure that Maureen lived a peaceful life away from people like him in this reality, he put some money aside for her but he also needed someone to keep an eye on her. Mariko accepted, she then told him he was a good man with a good heart before saying her final goodbye to him.

After he left Mariko's apartment, Logan knew that someone had been following him for a while, he told the stranger to meet him in a nearby pub to have a talk. In the pub, the stranger finally showed up and revealed his identity: Wolverine. He was back from the dead and he had been tracking Logan after hearing rumors that an older version of himself was running around. Logan decided to have a talk with his younger self telling him to never stop fighting, to go back with the X-Men and to be careful whenever he thought about settle down with someone. After one last beer, the two decided to face some drunk who started a bar fight.

All the loose ends finally tied up, Logan went back to Forge's laboratory in order to go back to his world. Before leaving, he said a final goodbye to Forge and told him to destroy Maestro's Time Travel machine after he went through the portal leading to his world to make sure that no one could use it ever again. Forge agreed and told Logan to look out for him in the Wastelands.

Logan then said goodbye to Jubilee, to Cecilia, to Hawkeye and finally to Glob. He then went through the portal and finally came back to his world while Forge destroyed the Maestro's Time travel machine. Now back to the Wastelands, it was time for Logan to finish what he started years ago.{{r|Dead Man Logan Vol 1 6}}

===[[Welcome Back, Logan]]===
====Reunited with Bruce Jr. and Dani====
[[File: Dead Man Logan Vol 1 7 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Back to the Wastelands]]
Back in the Wastelands, Logan discovered that he landed in [[Florida (State)|Florida]] which was now under the control of [[Curtis Connors (Earth-21923)|the Lizard]] and his gang. After fighting [[Joseph Manfredi (Earth-21923)|Joe Manfredi]] and his henchmen, Logan stole their truck and decided to head back to [[Sacramento]], but on the way he had to go through the Lair of the Creel Gang where he fought the [[Creel Gang (Earth-21923)|Creel Gang]], he then went to [[Nashville]] where he fought against the [[Phantom Riders (Earth-21923)|Phantom Riders]]. But after he arrived in [[Kaiser]], Logan's truck was destroyed by a mine and he was captured by The Ozarks cannibals.

This group of cannibals kept Logan prisoner for two weeks during which they ate him alive each day but one night Logan was saved by Dani Cage and Bruce Jr. After she freed him, Dani punched Logan and said she was angry that Logan abandoned her 7 years ago. Shocked by this revelation, Logan told her he could explain everything to her.

Dani told Logan that after what he did to the Red Skull, to the [[Punishers (Earth-21923)|Punisher Gang]], and to several others villains, a lot of people were now looking for him. Dani's fear would prove to be right because unknown to Logan, a ghost from his past was tracking him, someone Logan thought he killed a long time ago: [[Victor Creed (Earth-21923)|Sabretooth]].{{r|Dead Man Logan Vol 1 7}}

[[File: Dead Man Logan Vol 1 8 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Protecting the last Hulk]]
Now reunited with Dani and Bruce Jr., Danni drove Logan and Bruce Jr. to somewhere safe but she explained to Logan that they couldn't go to Sacramento as several people were looking for them here. Dani explained that after Logan killed the Red Skull and took down the Hulk gang, he created a power vacuum in the Wastelands and now everyone have been fighting to claim those territories. On top of that, several groups also tried to capture the young Bruce Jr. in order to shape him into a weapon they could use to gain dominance in the Wastelands while others just wanted to kill him to make sure no one could use him as a weapon.

Now in [[Kansas City]], Logan explained to Dani what happened to him but also that he decided to come back here because he was going to die soon, and he wanted to be buried next to his family. Dani was shocked by this reveal and hugged Logan but she soon discovered that Bruce Jr. was missing and they decided to go look for him.

They quickly found Bruce Jr. in a library where he was looking for some books to read but unfortunately while here he was attacked by a cult called [[Tranquility Temple (Earth-21923)|The Tranquility Temple]], who already tried to kill him in the past. This cult then unleashed a new weapon, [[Hulk-Killer (Earth-21923)|The Hulk-Killer]] designed to kill the Hulk. This weapon easily defeated Bruce Jr. and was about to kill him but Logan intervened and saved him while Dani tried to escape with the wounded Bruce Jr. But Logan was no match for this weapon, which easily overpowered him and pulled out both of his lungs.{{r|Dead Man Logan Vol 1 8}}

====Meeting an Old Friend====
[[File: Forge (Earth-21923) from Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 18 001.jpg|thumb|left|Old Man Forge]]
Despite the severe injury, Logan was able to get back on his feet and faced the Hulk-Killer once again. He managed to stab it several times and electrocuted it with a couple hundred thousand volts which took it down. Bruce Jr. was still hurt so Logan decided to have Dani drove them to the [[Badlands (Amerika)|Badlands]] where [[Forge (Earth-21923)|Forge]] was living to get help.

Bruce Jr. now safe, Logan was welcomed by Forge and his wife [[Elinore (Earth-21923)|Elinore]], Forge then made him visit the compound and told him he knew the truth about what Mysterio did to him. He then met [[Dwight Barrett (Earth-21923)|Dwight Barrett]] again who was now living at Forge's compound and was managing the security, and an [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-21923)|old Speedball]] who couldn't control his powers anymore and had to be kept in a safe chamber.

Days later, Logan decided to leave and let Dani and Bruce Jr. lived peacefully at Forge's compound but as he was about to leave, Sabretooth arrived with his army in order to capture Bruce Jr. and killed everyone else.{{r|Dead Man Logan Vol 1 9}}

[[File: Dead Man Logan Vol 1 9 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Logan facing Sabretooth and his army]]
Sabretooth's army stormed Forge's compound killing everyone, while Logan joined Forge's forces in order to repel them. In the midst of the battle, Logan discovered that Sabretooth's soldiers were [[Sabretooth Clones (Earth-21923)|clones of Sabretooth]] and while Logan was fighting his army of clones, the real Sabretooth kidnapped Bruce Jr. and escaped. Seeing that they were outnumbered, Forge told Logan and Dani to go after them while he helped the wounded Dwight to hide in an underground safe room where he would be safe before returning to the battle and saying one last goodbye to his wife. Forge then released Speedball from his safe chamber, who blew himself up which created a giant nuclear explosion that destroyed Forge's compound and stopped Sabretooth's army.{{r|Dead Man Logan Vol 1 10}}

====The Worthy====
[[File:Danielle Cage (Earth-21923) from Dead Man Logan Vol 1 11 001.png|thumb|left|Dani Cage proving she's worthy to be the new Thor]]
Logan and Dani were then able to track Sabretooth to Hammer Falls after Forge previously told Logan that Sabretooth was now working with [[Weapon X (Earth-21923)|Weapon X]] which had their facility located around here. Logan was then recognized by one of the merchants which started a fight since there was a bounty on Logan's head. Dani made quick work of one of their attacker, they then learned the location of the Weapon X Facility.

Logan and Dani then infiltrated the Weapon X Facility and discovered that the head of the new Weapon X program was [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-21923)|Mister Sinister]] himself. Sinister revealed that he was the one who resurrected Sabretooth and created several clones of him, but the clones were subpar and that was why he was after Logan at first until he discovered the existence of Bruce Jr. Sinister then revealed that he was the architect of the death of all the superheroes in this world, but the Red Skull took credit for everything and gave him nothing.

Having heard enough, Logan was able to free Bruce Jr. who then helped Dani and Logan escaped the facility. Sabretooth and his army caught up to them and after seeing that they were outnumbered, Logan told them he would surrender if they let Dani and Bruce Jr. go away, but Sabretooth decided to shoot Danni who fell to the ground on the hammer of [[Thor Odinson (Earth-21923)|Thor]] which moved as a result to the shock of everyone. Dani then managed to lift [[Mjolnir]] and became the new [[Thor]].{{r|Dead Man Logan Vol 1 11}}

====Legends Never Die====
[[File: Dead Man Logan Vol 1 12 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Legends Never Die]]
Dani now possessing the power of Thor was able to fight back Sabretooth's army with Bruce Jr.'s help. Logan knowing that he had to make this last fight count, injected himself with the last dose of Regenix in order to face Sabretooth one last time. After a brutal fight, Logan defeated Sabretooth and destroyed his body with his claws but this last dose of Regenix finally took its toll on Logan who wasn't healing anymore and was bleeding to death.

Sinister then confronted the trio but he was killed by Dani who threw Mjolnir to his head before stealing his car. Dani wanted to take Logan to an hospital but he told her that there was nothing to do, it was too late, he just wanted her to get him back home. Dani then drove to Logan's ranch in Sacramento, once they arrived Bruce Jr. and Dani helped Logan get to the graves of Maureen, Scotty and Jade. Logan said one last goodbye to Bruce Jr. and Dani who then left him alone with his family.

Now alone, Logan said he had never been more happy than when he was with Maureen, Scotty and Jade, he was sorry for not being here for them when they needed him the most and he hoped that when he saw them, they would be able to forgive him. Logan's last forces then abandoned him, he fell on his back and slowly died from his injuries, finally ready to be reunited with his family.

Logan was later buried by Dani and Bruce Jr. next to his family, they then decided to follow Logan's advices and keep fighting until they found a place they could call home.{{r|Dead Man Logan Vol 1 12}}

| Personality             = Logan's personality changed much through the years due to the traumatic events that led him to abandon his Wolverine identity. He learned to control his temper, suffering slights and abuse without flinching that would have sent his younger self into a murderous rage. Rather than follow his strong sense of honor and aggressive tendencies, Logan prioritized protecting his own family, and not drawing attention to himself, above all, leading him to accept a myriad of injustices. Losing his closest friends appears to have made him value those relationships more, seen most clearly in him naming his son after [[Scott Summers (Earth-21923)|Cyclops]]. After returning to the past, Logan's personality began to more closely resemble his old self. He began killing again, but also re-embraced his role as a hero.
