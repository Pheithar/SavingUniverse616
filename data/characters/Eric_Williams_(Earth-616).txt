===Early Years===
Eric Williams, the brother of [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Simon Williams]], who later became known as the Wonder Man, was born in [[Paterson]], [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]]. Eric was always the black sheep of his family. His mother, [[Martha Williams (Earth-616)|Martha]], would tell him that he was "born bad" whilst heaping affection on Simon. Eric's father, [[Sanford Williams (Earth-616)|Sanford]], was charged with disciplining him, but was abusive and uncaring. He even preferred to watch television lazily whilst Eric was torturing the family cat. At the same time, their mother Martha was loving and attentive to Simon, making Eric bitter and jealous as a result.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 2}}

[[Image:Eric Williams (Earth-616) from Dark Reign Lethal Legion Vol 1 2 002.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Eric Williams]]
One day, Eric was playing with chemicals in the garage and caused a fire that burned down their house. Simon felt guilty for having not stopped Eric, and resolved to be responsible for Eric from then on. As they grew older, Simon grew studious, while Eric was an athlete. Eric also became more rebellious and tried to get Simon to join him in his petty theft. Eventually, Eric joined the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] and moved to [[Las Vegas]]; meanwhile, Simon took over the family business, Williams Innovations.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 2}}

Partly due to competition with [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]], Williams Innovations began to fail. Desperate, Simon turned to Eric and his mob ties for help. Simon embezzled money from the company to invest with Eric, but Simon was caught and jailed. Simon was freed from jail by [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]], induced by an offer of revenge on [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] by defeating Iron Man and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. Simon was transformed into the Wonder Man in order to infiltrate the Avengers, but Zemo's empowering process also poisoned Simon, ensuring his loyalty in exchange for the antidote. Simon's better nature won out, however, and he died saving the Avengers from Zemo's trap.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 9}}

Learning of Simon's death, Eric was inflamed with guilt and anger. Through his Maggia contacts, he contacted the [[Phineas Mason (Earth-616)|Tinkerer]] who provided him with [[Grim Reaper's Scythe|his scythe weapon]]. Taking the name the Grim Reaper, he defeated the Avengers, but was beaten by the surprise appearance of the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 52}}

Later, the Grim Reaper confronted the Avengers with his [[Lethal Legion (Grim Reaper) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]] comprised of the [[Arthur Parks (Earth-616)|Living Laser]], the [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Power Man]], the [[M'Baku (Earth-616)|Man-Ape]], and the [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 78}} The Legion was defeated when the Grim Reaper found himself unable to strike down the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], having discovered that he possessed Simon's brainwave patterns.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 79}}

===The Master Plan of the Space Phantom===
The Vision met with the Grim Reaper who offered him a proposition. If the Vision aided him in getting revenge on the Avengers, he would transfer the Vision's mind into the body of the deceased, but preserved, Wonder Man. Not giving into the Grim Reaper's offer, the Vision refused; however, the Grim Reaper gave him a medallion that would put them into direct contact should the Vision change his mind.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 102}}

When the [[Space Phantom (Temporal Limbo)|Space Phantom]] returned, he teamed up with the Grim Reaper.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 106}} The Space Phantom and the Grim Reaper imprisoned some of the Avengers. The Grim Reaper then found the Vision and made his offer yet again. He took the Vision back to where the body of the Wonder Man was being stored, only to reveal that he really could not transfer the Vision's mind into the Wonder Man's body because the Wonder Man was dead; however, if they joined forces, he would transfer the Vision's mind into the living body of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. Trying to appeal to the Vision, the Grim Reaper revealed his and the Space Phantom's plan. To this end, the Space Phantom took the form of the [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]], and later the [[Supreme Hydra]] during Captain America's last battle against the terrorist organisation.

When the Space Phantom was unmasked by Captain America, he paralysed the star-spangled Avenger and his partner and then, to facilitate their plot, the Space Phantom made the whole world forget that Captain America was Steve Rogers, suppressed Captain America and [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]]'s memories of the event, and sent them on their way. Without finally revealing his and the Space Phantom's ultimate goal, the Grim Reaper asked if the Vision would go along with their plan so that he may be human, a question to which the Vision answered affirmatively.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 107}}

The Vision goaded the Grim Reaper to anger by suggesting that the Grim Reaper was merely one of the Space Phantom's lackeys. This gave Captain America the chance to attack and the Vision explained to Captain America that he was tricking the Grim Reaper into believing he had joined their cause in an attempt to free his captured comrades. The two Avengers then freed their friends and soon found themselves confronted by the Grim Reaper, the Space Phantom, and an army of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] soldiers. When the Space Phantom tried to kill the Vision, the Grim Reaper attempted to stop him, and soon a battle erupted between Hydra and the Avengers. The Avengers were soon felled by one of the Space Phantom's weapons, except for the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] -- who escaped to summon [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] -- and the Vision who was immune to the sonic attack. However, the Space Phantom got the Vision to surrender and allowed him to be imprisoned when he threatened to kill the Grim Reaper. The Space Phantom then chased after the Scarlet Witch so she could not rouse Thor, and she was quickly captured. The Space Phantom then arrived at the [[Avengers Mansion]] and attacked [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Jarvis]] and Rick Jones. Rick turned into [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], then freed the Avengers, and they all made short work of the Hydra army. Mar-Vell explained to the others that when Rick clashed the [[Nega-Bands]], the Space Phantom's powers attempted to become two people at once, which proved to be too much, and so the Space Phantom was transported to [[Limbo (Temporal)|Limbo]], while Rick was transported to the [[Negative Zone]] as usual. The Avengers allowed the Grim Reaper to go free.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 108}}

===Wonder Man===
After Wonder Man returned to life and joined the Avengers, Grim Reaper attacked the team and incapacitated them with his scythe blasts. When they awoke, he forced Wonder Man and Vision to undergo a trial to determine the true Simon Williams. Wonder Man eventually fought back and battled his brother. During the fight, Eric revealed that he was the one that hired [[Samuel Barone (Earth-616)|Black Talon]] to raise and reanimate Wonder Man. Ultimately, Wonder Man broke Grim Reaper's scythe and punched him out.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 160}}

Years later, no longer believing that either man was truly Simon Williams, the Grim Reaper attempted to kill Vision and Wonder Man at General Hospital. Vision had fallen into a coma after losing his arm in battle, and required an energy transfusion from Wonder Man. During the procedure, Grim Reaper incapacitated Scarlet Witch with chloroform, blasted the doctor, and attacked the vulnerable "brothers". Vision and Wonder Man revived, however, and defeated Grim Reaper.{{r|Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol 1 3}}

===Family Ties===
[[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron-12]], Goliath, and Man-Ape battled the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]]. After the villains captured and escaped with [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]] and Wonder Man, Hawkeye concluded they were working with Grim Reaper. {{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 1}} In New Jersey, the Grim Reaper met with Black Talon and [[Nekra Sinclair (Earth-616)|Nekra]]. He kissed Nekra, and confirmed that he had sent Ultron to capture Wonder Man. The trio of villains battled Vision and Scarlet Witch. In exchange for Wanda's life, they were allowed to escape with a zombie duplicate of Simon Williams.{{r|Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol 2 1}}

With his reunited Lethal Legion, Grim Reaper held Hank Pym and Wonder Man in an energicage. He revealed his plan to scan the minds of Vision and Wonder Man, erase any uncommon thoughts, and transfer "pure Simon Williams consciousness" into the zombie. Later, Grim Reaper lounged with Nekra. He became angry when Man-Ape interrupted, and yelled racial insults at the henchman.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 2}}

Ultron-12 attacked the Avengers' jet and crashed it. The team regained consciousness inside a cave, where the Grim Reaper had them all trapped in electricages. Mockingbird suddenly arrived and freed the Avengers. As they battled the Lethal Legion, Grim Reaper tried to flee through the caverns. Vision and Wonder Man pursued him. However, the cliff seemed to crumble beneath his feet, and the Grim Reaper fell to his death.{{r|Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol 2 2}}

===Unliving===
Over the next nine months, Nekra studied with Black Talon and learned how to raise the dead. She successfully reanimated Grim Reaper, but did not allow him to realize that he was a zombie. Instead, he convinced himself that his fatal fall was just a dream. Nekra then reanimated the duplicate of Simon Williams. She revealed that her zombies were not traditional, due to the knowledge she combined from voodoo, the Cult of Kali, and West African tribes. Any zombie she raises "is almost truly alive--and will think that it is if not told the truth." After raiding a sporting goods store for weapons, the villains arrived at the hospital where Scarlet Witch was giving birth. They battled Wonder Man and Magneto outside. Magneto took control of Grim Reaper's scythe, and used it to stab Reaper's other arm. Seeing no blood emerge from the wound, Grim Reaper angrily realized he was indeed a zombie. Confronted by the man she loved, Nekra's hate-fueled strength and spell faded. Grim Reaper reverted back to a corpse.{{r|Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol 2 12}}

He next appeared as part of Immortus' [[Legion of the Unliving (Kang) (Earth-616)]]. However, the Wasp claimed this was simply a simulacrum pulled out of time. Regardless of his true nature, this Grim Reaper faced off against Wonder Man. In the ensuing struggle, Wonder Man accidentally broke his neck.{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 2 61}}

===The Reaper and the Robot===
Nekra raised Grim Reaper from his grave again. This time, her spell required him to absorb a human life every 24 hours. He began by stabbing and draining Nekra. In an abandoned military bunker, he murdered a gang of cult members. When Wonder Man arrived to investigate, the two brothers fought. Grim Reaper discovered that he could not drain Simon's life energy, so he escaped in the darkness.{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 2 65}}

The next night, Grim Reaper killed and drained a homeless man. He and Wonder Man fought again, but were interrupted by [[Jerome Beechman (Earth-616)|Mandrill]]. The mutant sought to avenge his sister, Nekra. However the Grim Reaper drained him as well, then escaped through a manhole.{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 2 66}}

He walked through the sewer and discovered Ultron-13's lair. Ultron was in the process of transforming Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and Tigra into "robotized" andrones, and revealed his plan to do the same to the rest of California. Grim Reaper snuck up behind Ultron, and they briefly fought. Ultron used his eye beams to fuse Grim Reaper's scythe to his hand. Grim Reaper liked this new condition, and agreed to serve Ultron.{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 2 67}}

However, he revealed this was a ruse after Wonder Man arrived to search the lair. He explained to Simon that Ultron was inadvertently absorbing human energy through the robotizing process. Grim Reaper planned to turn against Ultron and drain that energy for himself. He offered Wonder Man a deal: if Simon agreed to stand aside and let Grim Reaper kill one person a day, Grim Reaper would help lead him to Ultron. The brothers crashed into Ultron's blimp at the Rose Parade. Grim Reaper fought Ultron, and succeeded in draining the robot's energy. Wonder Man then went against their agreement, and fought Grim Reaper as well. The battle ended when Grim Reaper and Ultron were caught in a feedback loop, with Hawkeye in the middle, and eventually collided.{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 2 68}}

===Fear the Reaper===
Later, Grim Reaper summoned the demon [[Lloigoroth (Earth-616)|Lloigoroth]] and asked for supernatural power. In repayment, he crashed a jet, killing the passengers aboard. He also attacked a subway train, sucking the commuters into a vortex. When the Avengers examined the jet's black box, they found a holographic projection of the Grim Reaper. He challenged them to come to the caverns where he died years ago. There, he attacked them with creatures made from magical energy before transporting the team through another dimensional vortex. {{r|Avengers Vol 1 352}} On the other side, he summoned his own Legion of the Unliving and sent them to attack the Avengers. {{r|Avengers Vol 1 353}} Confronted by the Vision, Grim Reaper accused the Avengers of murdering him. However, Vision revealed that Eric had actually leaped from the cliff and taken his own life. After he realized and admitted this, the Grim Reaper lost control over his Legion. They vengefully attacked him. Suddenly, Lloigoroth arrived and devoured the Grim Reaper.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 354}}

===Resurrection===
From another realm, Grim Reaper observed an Avengers Day parade. Later, he arrived in Central Park and interrupted a celebration dedicated to deceased members. He summoned the decayed bodies of Captain Marvel, Doctor Druid, Hellcat, Mockingbird, Swordsman, and Thunderstrike. Grim Reaper and his team defeated the Avengers, then placed a magical force field around the park. With the Avengers chained to to stone columns, he explained that Wonder Man's repeated returns from death in recent months had weakened dimensional barriers. This allowed Grim Reaper to return as well. He intended to share his pain with the world and feed off people's despair. The Avengers were rescued by their deceased members, after Scarlet Witch restored them to their true selves. Grim Reaper summoned winged creatures to help him fight. Scarlet Witch pulled Wonder Man through a rift to fully resurrect him. Because he was their anchor, the deceased Avengers faded away. Grim Reaper remained and fought Thor, until Wonder Man pulled his brother through the rift too. After the creatures and force field disappeared, Grim Reaper was sent to an asylum. {{r|Avengers Vol 3 10|11}}

Robots attacked the hospital and abducted Grim Reaper. He was shackled in Ultron's Slorenian base alongside Vision, Wonder Man, Scarlet Witch, Giant-Man and Wasp. Ultron intended to copy and combine their brain patterns to create a new robotic race. Vision took control of of the base's computer system and unshackled Grim Reaper, who then freed the other prisoners and escaped during the fight. {{r|Avengers Vol 3 19|22}}

In Ultron's former Manhattan base, Grim Reaper helped the Avengers fight robotic duplicates. He put a tracer on Wonder Man, then got away when the robots self-destructed. Grim Reaper followed the tracer to a robotic city in Egypt, helped the Avengers fight the armies of Alkhema and Ultron, and then escaped again. {{r|Avengers: The Ultron Imperative Vol 1 1}}

===Secret War===
The Grim Reaper was part of the aftermath of the [[Secret War]] that had been arranged by [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] against [[Latveria]]. He was among the villains who had been given technology by [[Latverian]] Prime Minister [[Lucia von Bardas (Earth-616)|Lucia von Bardas]] and sent to kill the heroes who had been involved in the Secret War.{{r|Secret War Vol 1 1|5}}

===Civil War===
[[File:Dark Reign Lethal Legion Vol 1 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Brother vs. Brother]]
The Grim Reaper was apparently one of the many villains who escaped from the [[Raft]] prison during the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]]. After being at large for several months, the Grim Reaper was eventually tracked down by Captain America and the [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], who together with their other friends brought the Grim Reaper down, and the [[Adrian Toomes (Earth-616)|Vulture]] and the Grim Reaper were beaten to a pulp and chained to a column.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 2}} Eric was later placed back into custody by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]{{r|Civil War: Front Line Vol 1 9}}

===Dark Reign===
The Grim Reaper was next seen teaming with the Man-Ape and the [[Saboteur (Earth-616)|Saboteur]]; how he escaped S.H.I.E.L.D. is uncertain.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 1 6|8}}

The Grim Reaper later formed a new line-up of the Lethal Legion as part of a plan against [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]], after Osborn's rise to power. The team was ultimately defeated by the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]] and [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] agents and once again imprisoned in the Raft. While there, the Grim Reaper was stabbed in the heart by an inmate loyal to Osborn, and had to undergo an operation.{{r|Dark Reign: Lethal Legion Vol 1 1}} It was also revealed that his brother Simon was a member of the Legion and also imprisoned in the Raft.{{r|Dark Reign: Lethal Legion Vol 1 2}}

It was then disclosed that the Grim Reaper had formed the Legion so Osborn could be seen as a hero for taking them down, as well as have the Wonder Man look bad and make him and his Dark Avengers look better than the originals. With his death faked he then left for [[Europe]] to establish a new powerbase for Osborn.{{r|Dark Reign: Lethal Legion Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Chaos War Dead Avengers Vol 1 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
===Chaos War===
When the mad god [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (Earth-616)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]] declared war on the pantheons of all worlds, he instigated the [[Chaos War]] by rallying an army of alien deities and destroyed the realms of the dead, flooding souls into the world of the living.{{r|Chaos War: Dead Avengers Vol 1 1}} Williams was chosen as one of his servants who, along with Nekra, were charged with killing the Avengers.{{r|Chaos War: Dead Avengers Vol 1 2}} In order to defend them, the Vision, whose soul was returned to [[Earth]] along with other fallen heroes, detonated himself, seemingly killing Williams in the process.{{r|Chaos War: Dead Avengers Vol 1 3}}

Surviving yet again, the Grim Reaper and the Lethal Legion tried to escape from jail,{{r|Avengers: X-Sanction Vol 1 1}} but they were stopped by the Avengers.{{r|Avengers: X-Sanction Vol 1 4}}

===Uncanny Avengers===
Eric next attempted to kill the Scarlet Witch, but [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] absorbed his powers and punched him, apparently killing him, although claiming she barely hit him.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 5}}
[[File: Eric Williams (Earth-616) from Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 10 cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Grim Reaper as a Horseman of Death]]
===Horseman of Death===
The Grim Reaper was brought back to life by the [[Apocalypse Twins (Earth-616)|Apocalypse Twins]],{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 7}} using both the Life Seed and Death Seed, in order to serve, alongside the [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]], and the [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]], as one of their [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horsemen of Death]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 9}} He was seemingly killed by Rogue once more, who punched him harder than she expected after absorbing the Wonder Man's powers, but he survived and later attacked his brother Simon, defeating and capturing him.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 10|12}}

When the Apocalypse Twins's plot to destroy Earth failed -- and their ark was destroyed by [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]] -- the Grim Reaper and Daken returned to Earth along with the corpses of the Apocalypse Twins.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 22}}

===[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]===
After the Vision purged his emotions,{{r|Avengers Vol 6 0}} he created a synthezoid family and moved to [[Arlington County|Arlington]], [[Virginia (State)|Virginia]] in order to become the Avengers's [[White House]] liaison. The family became instant celebrities, with their neighbours constantly seeking pictures, which they shared online. This caught the attention of Eric, who became upset that the Vision would create a family that appeared to be happy when the Williams family wasn't, as well as the fact that the Vision's brainwaves were taken from his brother Simon in the first place.

One night while their father was away with the Avengers, the Grim Reaper broke into the Vision's home, running his daughter [[Vivian (Synthezoid) (Earth-616)|Viv]] through with his scythe. Her twin brother [[Vin (Earth-616)|Vin]] rushed to her aid, but he too was struck down. Their mother [[Virginia (Earth-616)|Virginia]] then flew into a rage and beat Eric to death in front of her wounded children with a cookie sheet on their kitchen floor.{{r|Vision Vol 2 1}} Virginia disposed of the Grim Reaper's corpse by burying it in their yard, and kept his death a secret from her husband, claiming he had fled during the fight that had actually cost his life.{{r|Vision Vol 2 2}}

He was later brought back to Earth despite still being deceased when [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] restored [[Las Vegas]].{{r|Doctor Strange: Damnation Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = Originally, the Grim Reaper was a purely technological-based villain with no innate superhuman abilities.

* '''[[Necromancy]]:''' When he was resurrected he gained some mystical powers allowing him to re-animate the souls and bodies of the dead, either through [[Glossary:Voodoo|Voodoo]] training received from the [[Samuel Barone (Earth-616)|Black Talon]] or powers bestowed upon him by [[Lloigoroth (Earth-616)|Lloigoroth]].

Eric later received an enchanted scythe that was magically sharp and was capable of energy blasts much like the original, but could also be used to drain energy.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 4}}
