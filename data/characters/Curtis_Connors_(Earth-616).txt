===Early Life===
Dr. Curtis " Curt" Connors was born and raised in Coral Gables, [[Florida (State)|Florida]]. He attended Medical school graduating with twin doctorates in biology and biochemistry.

===Experiments===
[[File:Connors Formula from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 6.jpg|left|thumb]]
He became a gifted surgeon who enlisted in the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Army]]. He performed emergency battlefield surgery on wounded soldiers. However, his right arm was terribly injured in a wartime blast, resulting in its amputation. After returning to civilian life, Doc Connors devoted his life to creating a [[Connors Formula|serum]] to regenerate lost limbs. Using DNA from reptiles, who naturally re-grew lost limbs, Connors created a serum he was sure would work.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 6}}

===The Lizard===
Using himself as the first test subject, Connors injected himself with a dose of his formula and was ecstatic when his arm began to regenerate. However, the reptilian DNA his serum was based on mixed with, and altered, his own DNA, and turned him into a vicious creature known as '''The Lizard'''. While Connors was eventually "cured" by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and returned to his human appearance.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 6}}

Another attempt to develop this serum for safe use again resulted in Connors transforming into the Lizard, but on this occasion, he was saved thanks to his former colleague [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]] and his first team of [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|X-Men First Class Vol 1 2}}

After she joined the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] as "Komodo".{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #3}}

===Shed===
After Lizard's last appearance, he was able to kill Connors' son Billy. That killed Curt's consciousness and made a new creature of Lizard, the Shed. It possesses Connors' intellect and new powers. Spider-Man tried to defeat him but he failed.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #630|631}}

After using Connors' serum, which made him immune to Shed's new psychic powers, Spider-Man showed Shed pictures of Billy and "put pictures in his head".

===Origin of Species===
After most of the Spider-Man villains were hired to capture [[Lily Hollister (Earth-616)|Lily Hollister]]'s and Norman Osborn's newborn son, the Lizard was the second (after [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]]) to get the child. Connors took the newborn to his "nest" where he did tests on it to see if the infant was a special new species. Soon after, Spider-Man showed up to the nest along with [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] whom the Lizard took control of to fight Spider-Man.

Doc Ock was subdued and Spidey went to get the child from the Lizard who informed Peter that the boy was a useless new species and was not actually Norman Osborn's son. Doctor Octopus arrived again and battled the Lizard for taking control of his mind. Spider-Man left the scene with the infant at hand.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #644|646}}


===No Turning Back===
{{Quote|NO! I mustn't tell him! No one can ever know. The cure worked. My brain--my mind's been restored. And I know why I'm here... For the choices I've made. For Martha. For Billy. My name is Curt Connors. And this is my prison. My penance. My hell. And I deserve it.|[[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Curtis Connors]]}}
[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 631 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Lizard's third form.]]
After Morbius worked with [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon Labs]] in a cure for the spider-virus during the [[Spider-Island (Event)|massive infection in New York]], he started searching for a cure for himself and his friend, Curt Connors. He finally developed a successful cure which Spider-Man injected in the Lizard, turning him back to human form, but keeping his reptilian-mind, although he pretended he was totally cured to start creating a serum to turn back to the Lizard physically.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #688|689}}

After testing the serum in many Horizon employees, Curt injected himself with it, soon before being discovered by [[Carlie Cooper (Earth-616)|Carlie Cooper]], Curt escaped until Spider-Man managed to take him out of Horizon, when his transformation was fully completed, into a new and stronger form of the Lizard.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #690}} Using a cure developed by Morbius, Spider-Man managed to defeat the Lizard, but not to revert him to his human state. The Lizard was finally captured and put into custody in the [[Raft]], where he realized his human consciousness took over his reptilian body, stating that was the punishment he deserved.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #691}}

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 690 Davis Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Lizard's second form.]]
While in his own cell, Connors told Doctor Octopus, who was dying, that the cure worked and that he was trapped in the Lizard's body, unaware it was Spider-Man inside Doctor Octopus's body. When "Octavius" asked Connors to join him in a breakout made by [[Morris Bench (Earth-616)|Hydro-Man]], [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Scorpion]] and the [[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Trapster]], he declined with a snort, which prompted the Trapster to call him a "mindless beast."{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #699}} When Morbius managed to escape his cell, the Lizard pointed out that he still had nowhere to go.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #699.1}}

Curt escaped his cell after the security systems of the Raft were shot down by [[Alistaire Smythe (Earth-616)|Spider-Slayer]] during a break out.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #12}} While Spider-Man went after Spider-Slayer, J. Jonah Jameson was confronted by Scorpion, but was stopped by Connors. He revealed to Jameson that he had retained his human intelligence while they escaped, which Jameson acknowledged.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #13}}

===Dead No More===
While imprisoned at the [[Andry Correction Facility]], Connors was visited by the [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Jackal]]. He wanted Connors to join him, but he declined. To convince him to change his mind, he called the people who were accompanying him and, to Connors' surprise, they were his wife and son, alive and well. Connors then accepted to do his bidding.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 4}} Jackal later had Rhino free Connors and a depowered [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]] from the Andry Correction Facility.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 10}} Lizard began to work with Jackal on a procedure that would repower Electro.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 16}}

While escaping from [[New U Technologies (Earth-616)|New U Technologies]], Spider-Man and [[Gwendolyn Stacy (Earth-65)|Spider-Woman]] of [[Earth-65]] quickly incapacitated Lizard. When Doctor Octopus pulled a switch which activated the [[Carrion Virus]] in all of the clones and caused them to start rapidly decaying, Lizard saw that Martha and Billy were affected. During the ensuing battle, Lizard escaped with Martha and Billy as he vowed to find a way to keep them from dying.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 #3|5}} In the sewers of [[San Francisco]], Lizard saved Martha and Billy from the Carrion Virus by injecting them with the Lizard Formula, turning his wife and son into Lizards like him.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Omega Vol 1 #1}}

As part of an effort to return to his old life, the Lizard approached the Empire State University and signed over a dozen of his patents as an incentive so that they would let him become a member of the faculty staff again. After being given this second chance, Connors and E.S.U. developed a surgically embedded, [[Adamantium]]-encased inhibitor chip which enabled him to return to his human form and control his transformations into the Lizard. The chip would additionally paralyze him if he became aggressive while in his reptilian form. After Peter Parker's academic credentials were revoked for plagiarism, since he had completed his studies while Doctor Octopus was in possession of his body and had used his own work as a basis for Parker's thesis, Connors vouched for Peter, and convinced the faculty to give him another chance and join his class.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 2}}

===[[Hunted (Spider-Man Story Arc)|Hunted]]===
After his son was kidnapped by [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]], Connors sought to save him, but was also captured and caged along with Spider-Man, while they saw through a monitor Black Cat and Billy being hunted. Curtis reveals to Spider-Man that he had brought his son to [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] who told him that Billy was indeed his original son reborn in the clone body. Then out of desperation, asked Spider-Man to remove the inhibitor chip so he could save his son, despite the risk, unbeknownst to them that Kraven had planned all of this. Despite the odds, Connors is successful to save his son and escape without killing anyone.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 21|22}}

After reverting to his human form, Curt was unwilling to go back due to his fear of losing control. He build self-replicating robots which would attack him if he escaped and locked himself deep in the sewers. Spider-Man tried to find Curt, but was attacked by the robots, and he fought them, until Connors said to him to stop, and pleaded to let him alone. Spider-Man refused and while battling the robots convinced Curt that he to keep fighting to be a better person and make amend for his actions. Curt got rid of the robots, implanted a new inhibitor chip and returned to his family and to teaching.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 25}}

| Personality             = 

| Powers                  = '''Lizard Physiology:''' While transformed into The Lizard, Connors possesses a variety of superhuman attributes.{{r|Spider-Man: The Jackal Files Vol 1 1}}

* '''Superhuman Strength:''' Connors himself has the normal physical strength of a human male of his age, height, and build that engages in little regular exercise. While transformed, he possesses sufficient superhuman strength to lift about 12 tons. His physical strength has extended into the muscles of his legs allowing him to leap about 18 feet into the air.

* '''Superhuman Speed:''' While transformed, Connors can run and move at speeds greater than that of the finest human athlete and can reach a top speed of about 45 miles per hour.

* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' While transformed, Connors' advanced musculature produces considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. He can physically exert himself at peak capacity for about 24 hours before fatigue begins to impair him.

* '''Superhuman Durability:''' While transformed, Connors' scaly skin and superhumanly enhanced bodily tissues provide him much greater resistance to physical injury than an ordinary human. He can withstand great impact forces, falls from great heights, and small caliber bullets without sustaining injury.

* '''Superhuman Agility:''' In his transformed state, Connors' agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.

* '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Connors' reflexes are similarly enhanced while transformed and are superior to those of the finest human athlete.

* '''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Despite The Lizard's physical durability, he can sustain physical injury. However, if injured, his body is able to rapidly regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue with much greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human. While transformed, Connors' healing powers are developed to the point where he can fully regenerate missing limbs, just like many known reptile species.

* '''Tail:''' While transformed, Connors has a long, reptilian-like tail that he can use to help balance himself or as an offensive weapon. He is capable of whipping his tail at speeds of at least 70 miles per hour. Considering his strength and physical toughness, he can generate enough force to shatter concrete. Like some geckos, The Lizard can detach his tail and grow a new one.

* '''Fangs & Claws:''' While transformed, Connors' fingers and toes are each tipped with razor sharp claws that, combined with his natural strength, are able to cut most conventional materials including flesh, bone, wood, stone, and some types of metals. His mouth is also filled with rows of razor sharp teeth that he can use as offensive weapons in close combat situations.

* '''Wall Crawling:'''  As the Lizard, Connors has the same adhesive properties that a gecko has, which allows him to scale walls. This was demonstrated in his first appearance when fighting Spider-Man.

* '''Psionics:''' As The Lizard, Connors can telepathically communicate and control all forms of reptilian life within a two-mile distance. After his transformation into the shed, Connors has the ability to activate the "lizard part" in a human brain, causing them to act on basic reptile instincts.

| Abilities               = *'''[[Genius Intelligence]]:''' Connors has a genius-level intellect and is a world renowned herpetologist.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man 2004 Vol 1 1}}

| Strength                =
| Weaknesses              = Lizard's strength and agility are reduced when exposed to intense cold for more than a few minutes. High levels of stress can cause Dr. Connors to transform into the Lizard.

| Equipment               = 
* '''Inhibitor Chip:''' An Adamantium-encased inhibitor chip surgically grafted into Connors' neck. It allowed him to control his transformation into the Lizard. The chip also acted as a fail-safe which paralyzed Connors if he became aggressive while in his reptilian form and until he reverted to his human form.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 2}} The chip was removed by Spider-Man so Connors could rescue his son from the [[Last Son of Kraven (Earth-616)|Last Son of Kraven]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 21}} Later Curt implanted a new one.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 25}}
