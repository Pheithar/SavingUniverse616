| Overview                = '''Cletus Kasady''' is a sociopathic serial killer who has bonded with an [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|alien symbiote]] to become the notorious super-villain [[Carnage]].

Following a deeply troubled childhood that culminated in him razing [[St. Estes Home for Boys|an orphanage]],{{r|AXIS: Carnage Vol 1 2}}{{r|Carnage Vol 2 12}}{{r|Venom: Carnage Unleashed Vol 1 1}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 431}} Cletus became a serial killer and was eventually convicted for eleven consecutive life sentences. Imprisoned in [[Ryker's Island]], Cletus became cellmates with [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]], who had been separated from the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]]. When the symbiote rescued Eddie, it left behind an offspring that bonded to Cletus and merged with his blood, turning him into the monstrous Carnage.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 344}}

Over the years, Carnage has been a recurring enemy to Venom, and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], and even the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] - once leading a group of other murderers and monsters [[Maximum Carnage|on a rampage across Manhattan]]. Seemingly killed by [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|the Sentry]], Carnage returned more powerful than ever and began harboring megalomaniacal ambitions of conquest and godhood.

Cletus perished while separated from his symbiote, but [[Cult of Knull (Earth-616)|a cult]] worshiping the symbiote god [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] bonded him to [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a new symbiote]] linked to the dark god, reanimating him. The undead Carnage's plan to free Knull from [[Klyntar (Location)|his interstellar prison]] was opposed by Venom, who killed Kasady. After destroying Knull as well, Venom became the new King in Black, but Carnage enacted a plan from within the [[Astral Plane|Symbiote Hive-Mind]] to overthrow him.

| History                 =
===Early Life===
Accounts of Cletus Kasady's birth and childhood are known only through secondhand accounts and Kasady's own flawed recollections. Purportedly, he born in the [[Ravencroft Institute]] to a mother with paranoid schizophrenia, who died shortly after his birth.{{r|King in Black Handbook Vol 1 1}} 

Remanded into the custody of [[Nana (Cletus' Grandmother) (Earth-616)|a physically-abusive old woman]] who may or may not have been his biological grandmother, Cletus killed her by pushing her down a flight of stairs.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 12}} Cletus was subsequently sent to live with [[Roscoe Kasady (Earth-616)|Roscoe]] and [[Louise Kasady (Earth-616)|Louise]] - who were either foster parents or his biological father and step-mother.{{r|King in Black Handbook Vol 1 1}} While in their care, Cletus tortured and killed his mother's dog, Fifi.{{r|Venom: Carnage Unleashed Vol 1 1}} Afterward, Roscoe killed Louise either by accident while beating Cletus,{{r|Carnage Vol 2 12}} or while trying to stop Louise from killing Cletus in retaliation for him killing her dog.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 431}} Regardless, Roscoe was arrested and received no defense from Cletus during his trial, being sentenced to execution.{{r|Venom: Carnage Unleashed Vol 1 1}}{{r|Carnage: It's a Wonderful Life Vol 1 1}} As an orphan, Kasady was sent to the [[St. Estes Home for Boys]], where his antisocial behavior made him the target of bullying and abuse from both the other orphans and the staff. During his time at St. Estes', Cletus befriended a boy named [[Billy Bentine (Earth-616)|Billy Bentine]] after he took the blame for a fire Cletus started as a prank;{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 28}} and at some point in his teenage years he fell in love with a girl who ultimately broke up with him - leaving him despondent and depressed.{{r|Carnage: It's a Wonderful Life Vol 1 1}} When Cletus confessed his feelings to a girl he had a crush on, he was scornfully rejected and retaliated by pushing her in front of an oncoming school bus.{{AXIS: Carnage Vol 1 2}} Ultimately, Cletus set St. Estes' Home for Boys ablaze, murdering the disciplinarian administration and orphans who had bullied him in the process.{{r|AXIS: Carnage Vol 1 2}}{{r|Carnage Vol 2 1}}

[[File:Cletus Kasady (Earth-616) and Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 345 0001.png|thumb|left|Birth of Carnage]]
===Meeting Venom===
As an adult, Cletus became a notorious cannibalistic serial killer,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #344}}{{r|Carnage: Mind Bomb Vol 1 1}} but he was ultimately arrested and sentenced to eleven consecutive terms at [[Ryker's Island]];{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #345}} though he bragged of having killed a dozen more people.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #361}} An opportunity for early parole presented itself in the form of his new cell mate, [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #344}} who was the former host of an [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|extraterrestrial symbiote]] once bonded to [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] - having been separated from it during a battle with Spider-Man and the supervillains [[Jacob Eichorn (Earth-616)|Styx]] and [[Gerald Stone (Earth-616)|Stone]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #333}} Cletus dismissed Brock's claims of being [[Venom]] and that the symbiote would return for him as a delusion, and attempted to convert Brock to his nihilistic and homicidal philosophy on life: even the average person can commit murder, if only he has the courage.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #344}} Brock was disgusted by Kasady's worldview and quickly developed an antagonistic relationship with his cellmate, brutally beating him on multiple occasions.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 12}}

===Becoming Carnage===
Fed up with his cell-mate's disdain towards him, Cletus decided to murder Eddie using a shiv he'd created. Before he could do so, the Venom symbiote entered their cell through the window and bonded to Brock, who - transformed into Venom once more - incited a destructive jailbreak. Unknown to its human host, the symbiote was pregnant and gave birth during the disastrous rescue.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #345}} Left behind in the midst of the riot that ensued, the [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|symbiote's spawn]] bonded with Kasady,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #384}} entering into his bloodstream through a cut on his hand and amalgamating with his blood.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} Empowered far beyond the levels of Spider-Man and Venom combined, Kasady dubbed himself Carnage and made good his escape - intent on using his new-found power to disseminate his lethal doctrine: his first victim, a security guard named Ramone he pulled through the bars of his cell;{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #359}} the second, [[Gunther Stein (Earth-616)|Gunther Stein]], being chosen from a telephone book.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #360}}

[[File:Cletus Kasady (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 361 0002.jpg|thumb|right]]
Embarking on a citywide killing spree, Carnage was confronted by Spider-Man. However, the wall-crawler's amazing arachnid-like abilities were insufficient to subdue the thrice-strong serial killer,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #361}} forcing Spider-Man to enlist the aid of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]. He also sought the assistance of another, more dangerous ally: Venom, his hated foe. Venom was reluctant to ally with Spider-Man, but despised Kasady even more and agreed to help. Facing the combined might of Spider-Man and Venom, Carnage was captured and his symbiote seemingly destroyed.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #362|363}} He was imprisoned first at the [[Vault (Prison)|Vault]] and then his birthplace, Ravencroft Institute.{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited #1}}

In part to his insatiable bloodlust,{{r|Venomized Vol 1 3}} Carnage's strength and abilities far exceeded those of his predecessors, Venom and Spider-Man. Once, he even dispatched his symbiote through a phone line by reducing the alien to its cellular level.{{r|Venom: Carnage Unleashed #1}} When an army of [[Symbiotes (Race)|symbiotes]] invaded [[Earth]],{{r|Venom Super Special #1}} Carnage learned to feed on the other aliens to increase his own mass,{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Super Special #1}} possibly surpassing [[Manhattan Bridge]] in height.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Super Special #1}} However, Kasady's bloodthirsty endeavors ultimately culminated with his return to Ravencroft.

===[[Maximum Carnage (Event)|Maximum Carnage]]===
A doctor at Ravencroft, hoping to find a "cure" for his madness, drew blood from Kasady unwittingly enabling Kasady to transform into Carnage; who went on to recruit an army of psychopathic supervillains - including [[Frances Barrison (Earth-616)|Shriek]], [[Demogoblin (Earth-616)|Demogoblin]], [[Malcolm McBride (Earth-616)|Carrion]], and [[Doppelganger]] - to take over New York City. Using Shriek's "psychic channel" powers, he also drove ordinary New Yorkers to attack one another. Carnage and his "family" were ultimately driven back by Spider-Man, Venom and a number of other superheroes and anti-heroes, with Carnage and Shriek being remanded to Ravencroft.{{r|Maximum Carnage}}

[[File:Cletus Kasady (Earth-616) and Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Webspinners Tales of Spider-Man Vol 1 14 001.jpg|thumb|left|Linked to the [[Carnage II (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Negative Zone symbiote]].]]
===Loss and Restoration of the Carnage Symbiote===
While contained in a specialized super-max cell in the [[Manhattan Correctional Facility]], Cletus Kasady was attacked by Venom, who ripped the Carnage symbiote from his body and devoured it.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 10}} Without the symbiote, Kasady attempted to reassume the Carnage persona by covering himself in red paint and continuing his killing sprees, claiming that he still possessed at least some of Carnage's strength and convinced that he only needed to kill Spider-Man and Venom to regain his symbiote. Spider-Man nevertheless easily defeated him in a fight, and he was sent back to prison.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 13}} Guided by remnants of the Carnage symbiote within his body, Kasady travelled to the [[Negative Zone]], where he struck an alliance with [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]] - offering to aid his conquest of Earth. Cletus found [[Carnage II (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a second symbiote]] that had been sealed away and bonded with it to become Carnage again, turning on Blastaar in an attempt to force him to destroy reality itself. Stopped by Spider-Man and [[Dusk (Rebel Leader) (Earth-616)|Dusk]], Cletus was returned to Manhattan and arrested, but regained his symbiote.{{r|Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man Vol 1 13|14}}

===Birth of Toxin===
[[File:Venom Vs. Carnage Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Carnage vs. [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]].]]
During a battle with Venom, Carnage discovered his symbiote was about to give birth. Feeling threatened by its existence, Carnage attempted to suppress the birth and destroy it.{{r|Venom Vs. Carnage #1}} However, Venom wanted to raise and train the new symbiote as an ally and partner. Weakened by the actual birthing, Carnage was unable to kill the newborn, bonding it to [[Patrick Mulligan (Earth-616)|Patrick Mulligan]], a [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|New York City cop]]. Venom named the new symbiote [[Toxin (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Toxin]], after himself.{{r|Venom Vs. Carnage #2}} Fearing that Toxin would grow to become someone like Spider-Man, Venom made a temporary alliance with Carnage to kill his "grandson",{{r|Venom Vs. Carnage #3}} but in the end they were defeated by the combined efforts of Spider-Man, Toxin, and [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]].{{r|Venom Vs. Carnage #4}}

[[File:Robert Reynolds (Earth-616), Cletus Kasady (Earth-616), and Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from New Avengers Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|left|The Death of Carnage?]]
===Raft Break-Out===
Imprisoned in the Raft, Carnage participated in an attempted breakout but was grabbed by the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]], who flew him into [[Earth Orbit|orbit]] and ripped him in half at the waist.{{r|New Avengers #2}} According to [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]'s computer, Cletus may not have been inside the symbiote when the Sentry ripped it apart,{{r|Mighty Avengers #8}} but this assessment was incorrect.<!--{{r|Carnage #4}}-->

Cletus was placed into a dormant state by the Carnage symbiote to keep him alive, though it nearly perished after several months.{{r|Carnage #4}} Orbiting Earth, Carnage's body crashed into a satellite owned by [[Hall Industries (Earth-616)|Hall Industries]],{{r|Carnage #2}} and was recovered by [[Michael Hall (Earth-616)|Michael Hall]], a competitor of Tony Stark. Hall proceeded to retrieve Carnage's body from space and separated Cletus from the symbiote, placing him in a hospital as a John Doe. Using the symbiote, Hall created [[Hall Industries' Symbiote Prosthetics|prosthetic limbs]] and [[Iron Ranger Armor|exo-suits]] which responded in the same ways as a symbiote. Cletus was subsequently outfitted with a prosthetic lower body and placed in containment in a cell under Hall Industries corporate headquarters.{{r|Carnage #3}}

The Carnage symbiote eventually reunited with Cletus by taking over Dr. [[Tanis Nieves (Earth-616)|Tanis Nieves]] - Shriek's psychologist - who had been outfitted with one of the prosthetic arms derived from it after she was caught in an attack [[Doppelganger (Spider-Man) (Earth-616)|Doppelganger]].{{r|{{cl|Carnage Vol 1 1}}-[[Carnage Vol 1 2|2]]}} Reunited with his symbiote and Shriek, Cletus became Carnage once more and battled Iron Man and Spider-Man. When confronted by Hall Industries' [[Iron Rangers (Earth-616)|Iron Rangers]], who were outfitted with symbiote-based armour, Cletus was informed by the Carnage symbiote that it had developed the ability to produce and control offshoots of itself as a result of Hall's experimentation. Using this power, Carnage killed and assimilated the Iron Rangers' suits to become "Mass Carnage". Meanwhile, Nieves' prothesis was revealed to be [[Scorn (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a new spawn]] of Carnage, which turned her into a new symbiote called [[Scorn (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Scorn]]. Scorn forced Shriek to use her sonic attack on Mass Carnage, who was revealed to be a construct, the real Carnage having escaped with Doppelganger.{{r|Carnage #4}}

===Carnage, U.S.A.===
Directed by his symbiote, Cletus arrived in [[Doverton]], [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]] and took over their population by controlling them with offshoots of his symbiote, proclaiming this city the new capital of a new symbiote sovereign state. Part of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], along with the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]], arrived to stop him, but were possessed by the symbiote's copies, letting Spider-Man the only hero standing.{{r|Carnage, U.S.A. #1}} Spidey managed to get out from there with the help of the resistance of non-infected citizens.{{r|Carnage, U.S.A. #2}}

When the [[Mercury Team (Earth-616)|Mercury Team]] - a squad of symbiote-augmented super-soldiers - along with Scorn, attacked the zone in search of Carnage,{{r|Carnage, U.S.A. #3}} Spider-Man and the resistance appeared to help them. [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Venom]] appeared just in time to save Spider-Man's life from Cletus, but when Scorn used a sonic weapon to sever the bond between Cletus and Carnage, she also affected Venom.{{r|Carnage, U.S.A. #4}} Leaving Cletus against an invalid Flash Thompson, the two rogues symbiotes started fighting using animals. The Avengers and Scorn managed to weak Carnage's and destroy Cletus' cybernetic legs using a sonic weapon, while a gorilla with Venom's took it back to Flash; when both of them were fighting. The Carnage symbiote was captured by Scorn, while Cletus was taken into custody in a [[Quinjet]].{{r|Carnage, U.S.A. #5}}

===Minimum Carnage===
[[File:Venom Vol 2 26 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Vs. [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]] and [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]].]]
Cletus was put into custody in the [[Thunderbolts Mountain]] and his symbiote was seemingly destroyed. He was contacted by beings of the [[Microverse]], who managed to see inside his mind and offer him a treat; they would give him the Microverse to get a whole new universe to kill in exchange for his services. The symbiote regenerated due to having integrated itself into him at a cellular level, letting him become Carnage once more. Escaping, Carnage traveled to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in [[Texas (State)|Texas]] and used a new technology to escape to the Microverse, even after [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]] tried to stop him.{{r|Minimum Carnage: Alpha #1}}

He betrayed his allies, who wanted to bring him to their master, [[Radu (Microverse) (Earth-616)|Marquis Radu]], in order to create a symbiotic army; and killed most of them{{r|Venom Vol 2 26}} while Venom and Scarlet Spider followed him to the Microverse.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 10}} After dealing with the Scarlet Spider, Carnage was taken prisoner along with Venom, who was captured along his allies, the [[Micronauts (Earth-616)|Enigma Force]], by Marquis Radu's army.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 11}}

The symbiotes of Venom and Carnage were replicated and hybridized to create the powerful army which would destroy the Microverse. Cletus managed to take control over the symbiotic army and used it to escape to the regular universe,{{r|Venom Vol 2 27}} where he was finally defeated by the combined efforts of Venom and Scarlet Spider, who used a special weapon given to them by the Enigma Force. After being stung by the Scarlet Spider, Cletus cured his wounds, but was left in a catatonic state, meaning that the symbiote was now in full control of his body, although it was put into custody once more and sedated.{{r|Minimum Carnage: Omega #1}}

[[File:Cletus Kasady (Earth-616) and Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Superior Carnage Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Carnage symbiote weakened due to the [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]] member, [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Klaw]].]]
===Superior Carnage===
Carnage was freed from imprisonment by [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|The Wizard]], who, still thinking Cletus was in control of the symbiote, wanted to make him part of his newest [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]]. However, Carnage was unaffected by The Wizard's powers and attacked him. Before Carnage was able to finish him off, [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Klaw]] was able to stop Carnage and save The Wizard.{{r|Superior Carnage #1}} After realizing that Carnage could not be affected by his powers, and could not be separated from his host by traditional means since the Symbiote was embedded in Cletus' blood, The Wizard began transferring Carnage to a new host by transfusing Cletus' blood into [[Karlin Malus (Earth-616)|Karl Malus]].{{r|Superior Carnage #2}} Later, The Wizard blew up his secret base, with Kasady still inside, apparently killed.{{r|Superior Carnage #3}}

However, Cletus survived the explosion, with some major skin burns, and was recovered by [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Superior Spider-Man]]'s [[Spiderlings (Earth-616)|Spiderlings]]. When the Carnage symbiote bonded to The Wizard, Otto decided he could use the symbiote's preference for Cletus in order to make it abandon The Wizard, by taking Kasady to the scene, and contain the alien before it could merge with its original host. However, the mission failed, and Cletus became Carnage once more as the Spiderlings failed to contain the symbiote. Carnage rampaged through the scene until Klaw, whose sonic body had been dispersed, managed to redirect lightning to Carnage and separate him from Kasady. Both beings were taken separately to custody. Unknown to Spider-Man, the symbiote's rebonding with Kasady fixed the villain's brain, who was now no longer lobotomized.{{r|Superior Carnage #5}}

Cletus became a model prisoner, for which he was transferred to [[Kramer Penitentiary]]. He was fatally wounded by a fellow inmate, who was paid by [[Doctor Jenner (Earth-616)|Dr. Jenner]], Cletus' psychologist who wanted to become Carnage's new host. Kasady was suffocated to death with a pillow by Jenner in Kramer's infirmary. When the Carnage symbiote escaped containment and returned to Cletus, it refused Jenner's offer to become its new host, and bonded and reanimated Cletus, becoming Carnage once more and killing the entire staff and prisoners to send the message to the world that "Carnage was back."{{r|Superior Carnage Annual #1}}

[[File:Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Vs. [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]].]]
Cletus decided to go 'back to basics' and went on a seemingly random killing spree with no reason or patterns to his victims. However [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] was able to find a pattern in Carnage's madness and continually found him much to Cletus' frustration. Playing mind games with Carnage, Deadpool was able to put doubt in Cletus in the existence of chaos and that all his actions were being controlled by an outside force. This came to a head when Carnage almost killed Shriek, and he placed himself in an unlocked jail cell to wait until his mind was clear of doubt again.{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage #1|4}}

===[[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|AXIS]]===
When the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Onslaught]] was unleashed, [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] recruited numerous villains to stop the madman's [[Stark Sentinel|Stark Sentinels]]. He approached Carnage in his self-confinement, and convinced Cletus to join him as there would be nothing more chaotic than him saving the world.{{r|Magneto Vol 3 11}} Noticing Deadpool was part of Magneto's team, Carnage joined intending to exact revenge, but following the inversion spell which changed the moral axis of those in the island, they parted amicably.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #3}}

[[File:AXIS Carnage Vol 1 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Your Friendly Neighborhood... Carnage?!]]
After the inversion, Cletus returned to [[New York City|New York]], stopping a robbery and apprehending the [[Donald Callahan (Earth-616)|Squid]] with zero fatalities.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #4}} Even though the spell brought out a desire to do good, his sociopathic tendencies made it hard for him to behave like a hero, causing him to brutalize criminals and still be treated as a villain. After saving reporter [[Alice Gleason (Earth-616)|Alice Gleason]] from a new [[Sin-Eater (AXIS) (Earth-616)|Sin-Eater]], whom Kasady seemingly killed, he kidnapped her to teach him how to be a real hero.{{r|AXIS: Carnage #1}} Alice agreed to help him be good as long as he promised not to hurt her, which he accepted. They headed to a church for Cletus to confess his sins but he attacked a tomb digger thinking he was robbing from the graves. Alice instead recorded his confession in her phone and secretly sent it to her boss. He later stopped a bank robbery but tried to burn the bank to stop future robberies. He fled as the police arrived but Alice fell and was kidnapped by the Sin-Eater while Carnage was surrounded by the police.{{r|AXIS: Carnage #2}} Despite being shot down by two missiles, Carnage located the Sin-Eater and rescued Alice. The Sin-Eater - who claimed to be the spirit of [[Emil Gregg (Earth-616)|Emil Gregg]] - fed on Carnage's sins, growing into a giant while Cletus feels the burden on his conscience being relieved. Carnage defeated him by overloading him with a last sin: that he loved all the destruction he caused, and the Sin-Eater dwindles into a shriveled corpse that disintegrates. Feeling reborn, Carnage thanks the Sin-Eater's corpse for absolving his sins before having his head shot off by Alice. Regenerating, Carnage asked why she betrayed him, and Alice admitted that she had lied to him about being a good person and had only been using him for personal gain, screaming at the newly arrived police to open fire. Carnage misinterpreted her betrayal as a warning that falling in love was dangerous, and reaffirmed his desire to become a superhero while escaping.{{r|AXIS: Carnage #3}}

[[File:Magneto Vol 3 11 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Joining the [[Astonishing Avengers (Earth-616)|Astonishing Avengers]].]]
Cletus was later reunited with the other inverted villains to form the [[Astonishing Avengers (Earth-616)|Astonishing Avengers]] in order to stop the inverted heroes.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #6}} Before the later-known "Battle of [[Manhattan]]," Carnage acted as the face of the Astonishing Avengers, dubbing them the "Axis of Evil", and had them take all of the blame for the actions of the inverted heroes in order to protect the reputations of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], Avengers, and [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] in the aftermath at the expense of the newly achieved heroic reputations of himself and [[Roderick Kingsley (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]].{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #9}} The Astonishing Avengers fought the inverted X-Men in Manhattan, who were trying to detonate a gene bomb which would've killed everyone in the planet who wasn't a mutant.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #7}} As the time was running out and there were no options left, while the Avengers were distracting the X-Men, Carnage decided to sacrifice himself and use the symbiote to wrap around the bomb and contain the explosion, seemingly killing him. Before his apparent death, Cletus asked Spider-Man to build an extravagant memorial for him.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #8}} His death was seemingly confirmed when [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] found the remains of the Carnage symbiote around the area where the bomb had been. After Cletus' apparent death and in the aftermath of the battle itself, Peter Parker was seen building the memorial as he had promised.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #9}}

[[File:Nova Vol 5 27 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Making new friends.]]
===Post-AXIS===
Cletus was able to survive the gene bomb's explosion, though he lost his legs in the process. Cured of his inversion after a counterspell was cast and disgusted by his behavior as a hero, he went to Carefree, [[Arizona (State)|Arizona]], to pay a visit to a new friend he'd made during the time he was inverted,{{r|Nova Vol 5 24}} a friend he was willing to "help", [[Samuel Alexander (Earth-616)|Sam Alexander]] aka [[Nova]]. Cletus left a message signaling his return in the form of murdering a random bystander who he had asked where to find the boy as proof that he was reverted to his natural moral axis.{{r|Nova Vol 5 25}}

After learning that [[Eva Alexander (Earth-616)|Sam's mother]] worked at a local diner, Cletus took her hostage there in order to get his attention, but, tired of waiting, Cletus decided to kill her. Nova arrived before he could do so and took him away from the diner to an empty area in order not to hurt anyone. While fighting, Nova tried to convince him that he wasn't Sam Alexander, but Cletus didn't believe him. After being wounded by the [[Glossary:Nova Force|Nova Force]], Cletus fled to let his symbiote heal him as the police arrived. The next day, already healed from his burns, Cletus attacked Sam again, this time at his school.{{r|Nova Vol 5 26}} While attacking Sam, Carnage saw Nova flying around the area, thus making it impossible for the boy to be Nova (unbeknownst to him, that was Sam's mother wearing his [[Nova Helmet (Supernovas)|helmet]]). Enraged, Carnage followed the false Nova, but lost sight of her. He then started to attack innocent people to try and get Nova's attention, provoking a new battle between them.

Carnage was taken by Nova to the sky and then punched into the parking lot below, the impact setting off the cars' alarms, dizzying Cletus and his symbiote. Cletus was then thrown by Nova, who had already realized Carnage's weakness to loud sounds, into an [[Anthrax (Rock Band) (Earth-616)|Anthrax]] (a heavy metal band which Cletus was a fan of) show nearby. As the symbiote screamed in pain, Cletus fled to the road, but was attacked by Nova again. He threw a car at Nova, who caught it midair, and took advantage of it to punch him. As he was about to finish his opponent off, Carnage was hit by a truck. He was then tied in metal plates by Nova, and left by his symbiote as he revealed he wanted to kill Nova because he wanted to erase any memory of his good deeds from the time he had his moral axis inverted from anyone who remembered it. He was left by Sam in [[Ryker's Island]].{{r|Nova Vol 5 27}}

===The Darkhold===
Having escaped from Ryker's, Carnage was lured to [[Grey Ridge Mine]] in West Virginia by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|FBI]] upon learning its chief of security, [[Manuela Calderon (Earth-616)|Manuela Calderon]], was the sole survivor of Kasady's first mass murder. A [[Anti-Symbiote Task Force (Earth-616)|task force]] that included FBI agent [[Claire Dixon (Earth-616)|Claire Dixon]], Army soldier [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]] (aka [[Man-Wolf]]), and Eddie Brock (the latest host of the Toxin symbiote) attempted to capture Carnage, but the plan fell apart when Carnage and several FBI agents fell through a fracture into a played-out section of the mine, an occurrence set up by the owner of the mine, [[Barry Gleason (Earth-616)|Barry Gleason]], who turned out to be a member of the occult group known as the [[Darkholders (Earth-616)|Darkholders]]. Gleason lured Carnage deeper into the mine until he reached a secret temple, where Gleason and the Darkholders attempted to sacrifice Carnage in a ritual that involved the [[Darkhold]], a book of ancient times that made reference to Carnage as the "Red Slayer." The ritual resulted in the unexpected enhancement of Carnage's powers, prompting Kasady to take the Darkhold with him when he slip away from the FBI's task force.{{r|{{cl|Carnage Vol 2 1}}-[[Carnage Vol 2 5|5]]}}

[[File:Carnage Vol 2 15 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Carnage and Chthon]]
Carnage would soon make his way to an uncharted island where he could unlock the Darkhold's powers. On his way there, he hijacked a freighter a group of Darkholders planned to use to bring Carnage to said island, and learned in the process the Darkhold's connection to [[Elder Gods of Earth|Elder God]] [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]]. The FBI's task force followed him to the ship, now joined by Darkhold expert [[Victoria Montesi (Earth-616)|Victoria Montesi]], and tried to stop him. Carnage used the Darkhold on Claire Dixon, turning her into his own symbiote-possessed puppet named [[Raze]]. In an attempt to destroy Carnage, Raze and the Darkhold, the task force blew up the freighter. Carnage survived, and was found adrift at sea by young sailor [[Jubulile van Scotter (Earth-616)|Jubulile van Scotter]]. Carnage infected Jubulile with a symbiote, which created a psychic connection between the two, but she managed to escape and was later found by the anti-Carnage task force.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 6|10}}

Once he reached the island and reunited with Raze, Carnage delved deeper into its territory until he found the Chthonic temple and the altar. He performed a ritual that summoned Chthon to the world with the intention to destroy it. Kasady attempted to have Chthon reward him with more power, but failed. Having tracked down Carnage to the island and subsequently the temple, the task force confronted him. Chthon was confronted by Jubulile, who was empowered by her symbiote, the Toxin symbiote absorbed from Brock, and the [[Raze (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Raze symbiote]] absorbed from Dixon. Jubulile was given more power when Montesi took the Darkhold from Carnage and fed her psychic energies from all over the world, allowing her to become powerful enough to banish Chthon. Montesi also used the Darkhold on Carnage, casting a spell that stripped Kasady of his symbiote and reshaped it into a cage that detained him. The members of the task force later parted ways, with Calderon and Jameson deciding to deliver Kasady to the FBI.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 11|16}}

Kasady was subsequently stripped of the Carnage symbiote, with it having been kept separate from him at the [[Lock Box]] before being stolen and delivered to [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 794}} Osborn ultimately ripped the Carnage symbiote off when he realized that Cletus would get the credit if he killed Spider-Man while bonded to it, but the symbiote installed a copy of Cletus' psyche into Osborn's mind when it was killed in the process of bonding to him, giving him a new split personality.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800}}

===The Poison Invasion===
Kasady was re-incarcerated in Ravencroft, placed in a specialized cell that kept him immobilized and suspended off the ground. When the [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)|Poison Hive]] attacked Earth-616, Kasady was approached by Poisoned incarnations of Morbius, Kraven the Hunter, and Lady Deathstrike, who mocked how pathetic he was without the Carnage symbiote or his legs. Pleased that Kasady's insatiable bloodlust was intact, the Poisons brought him onboard their flagship and offered him the chance to become Carnage again if he allied with them. Kasady - unaware that the Poisons intended to consume him before he became a threat and use the ensuing Poison Carnage as a weapon of mass destruction - eagerly accepted, believing they would return his beloved symbiote to him. He was instead used as a test subject and forcibly bonded [[Carnage III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a new symbiote]] that the remnants of the Carnage symbiote in his blood attempted to reject, causing him excruciating pain in the process.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 1|2}} Upon breaking free, he began to rampage but was quickly consumed by an unbound Poison.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 3}} Despite Poison Doom's precautions, Cletus' psyche was able to mostly-resist being consumed,{{r|{{cite web|url=http://cullenbunn.tumblr.com/post/173575669329/was-carnage-really-not-assimilated-by-the-poisons|title=Was Carnage really not assimilated by the Poisons, like Deadpool and Jean Grey, or that was the Poison exhibiting traces of his personality?|work=Tumblr|first=Cullen|last=Bunn|date=May 4, 2018|accessdate=May 4, 2018}}}} and [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)/Members#Poison Carnage|Poison Carnage]] only pretended to be loyal to the Hive.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 5}} He attacked [[Alchemax (Earth-616)|Alchemax]] alongside [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)/Members#Poison Doctor Druid|Poison Doctor Druid]], [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)/Members#Poison Killer Thrill|Poison Killer Thrill]], the [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)/Members#Poison X-Force|Poison X-Force]], and [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)/Members#Poison Thundra|Poison Thundra]]; but was angered when informed their mission wasn't to fight but to bolster the Hive's ranks.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 4}}

[[File:Cletus Kasady (Earth-616) from Venomized Vol 1 4 001.jpg|thumb|right|Poison Carnage]]
Poison Carnage threatened Poison Doctor Druid into teleporting him and the other Poisons back to their ship. Once there, Poison Carnage battled both [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]] and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], nearly decapitating the former and impaling the latter. He was ultimately tossed into space by Venom and [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]].{{r|Venomized Vol 1 5}}

===[[Absolute Carnage|Prophet of the Void]]===
After the Poison Queen's death, Poison Carnage's crystalline exoskeleton and consumed symbiote crumbled to reveal Cletus Kasady somehow restored to humanity. As gravity took hold of Cletus, the remnants of the original Carnage symbiote emerged in an attempt to shield his body from the reentry plasma but perished despite its ''Darkhold''-augmentations, leaving him badly burnt. Cletus crash-landed in the desert and died from his severe injuries, his body being recovered and ID'd by authorities.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}}

The [[Cult of Knull (Earth-616)| Cult of Knull]], an apocalyptic cult dedicated to worshiping Knull and led by a corrupted [[Tanis Nieves (Earth-616)|Scorn]], attacked the convoy transporting Cletus' body to retrieve it, and later stole [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a sample]] of the primordial [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel symbiote]] from the [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]]'s [[Interdimensional Council of Reeds (Multiverse)|Project Oversight]] laboratory.{{r|Venom Vol 4 7|8}} Scorn bonded the piece of the Grendel symbiote to Cletus, intending to turn him into Knull's new vessel. Reanimated by the primordial symbiote, Cletus was psychically connected to the dark god, fighting against his will for control of his now-undead body. Cletus' connection to Knull was broken when he ripped out Scorn's spine to consume the trace remnants - or codex - of the Carnage symbiote left over from her time as its host and consumed it. Altering the piece of the Grendel symbiote to match the appearance of the Carnage symbiote, Cletus decided to help free Knull and set out to hunt down and consume the codices of the other symbiote hosts, living and deceased.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} Assuming leadership of the cult, Carnage subsequently conquered San Francisco's underground city -- which Venom had once guarded as the Lethal Protector -- and used his newfound abilities to infect the inhabitants with symbiote "brain worms" - maggots infected with the Carnagized Grendel symbiote - sending them to hunt down those who possessed symbiote codices.{{r|Web of Venom: Unleashed Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Web of Venom Carnage Born Vol 1 1 Virgin Variant.jpg|thumb|right|Dark Carnage's second form, after absorbing Tanis Nieves' Carnage codex.]]
Recruiting Shriek and Doppelganger once more, Carnage returned to Doverton, Colorado and claimed the codices of the Carnage symbiote left in its populace; infecting John Jameson with the Carnagized Grendel symbiote so that he could act as a sleeper agent.{{r|Web of Venom: Cult of Carnage Vol 1 1}} Carnage -- now sporting Knull's spiral emblem on his forehead -- traveled to Philadelphia to claim [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Andi Benton]]'s symbiote codex, killing her aunt Sarah and the [[Monsters of Evil (Earth-616)|Monsters of Evil]], though Andi used the demonic powers of her [[Hell-Mark]] to escape.{{r|Web of Venom: Funeral Pyre Vol 1 1}} Carnage returned to Manhattan, but during the [[War of the Realms]] he opted to sit out the combat and chaos rather than reveal himself prematurely; establishing a lair in the sewers and subways under [[Grand Street]], and infecting more homeless people and animals with the Carnageized Grendel symbiote to act as his minions.{{r|Venom Vol 4 15}} After the war's end, Carnage [[Everyone Is a Target|began sending his minions out to hunt for codices]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 24}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 11}}{{r|Black Cat Vol 1 2}} and resurrected Emil Gregg to torment Eddie.{{r|Venom Vol 4 16}} Carnage and his followers also exhumed the bodies of every deceased people who'd bonded to a symbiote, harvested their codices, and left the desecrated bodies in a mass grave in the shape of Knull's spiral.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}}

Greatly empowered, Kasady was transformed into "Dark Carnage" -- a thirteen foot-tall skeletal monster with Knull's spiral on its forehead and a white dragon/spider emblem on his chest. Harvesting the codices of the [[Project Venom (Earth-616)|Weapon V]] super-soldier program and [[Leonard Elkhart (Earth-616)|Leonard Elkhart]], a one-time host of the Venom symbiote,{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage: Symbiote Spider-Man Vol 1 1}} Dark Carnage traveled to Nicaragua and attacked [[Alejandra Jones (Earth-616)|Alejandra Jones]], whose [[Spirits of Vengeance (Earth-616)|Spirit of Vengeance]] had at one point melded with the Venom symbiote and transferred a codex into her. Despite interference from another Ghost Rider, [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Danny Ketch]], Dark Carnage ripped out Alejandra's spine and ate it, temporarily absorbing her Spirit of Vengeance. Delighting in his new demonic powers, Dark Carnage battled Ketch but was retrieved by his followers when they started to fade. Chastised for losing sight of the cult's goals, Dark Carnage lashed out at them before resuming the hunt for codices.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Symbiote of Vengeance Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1 Bradshaw Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Dark Carnage's third form, sporting [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]'s spiral on his forehead.]]
Upon arriving in Manhattan, Dark Carnage attempted to break into the old [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]], impersonating Eddie Brock and allowing himself to be arrested. Kasady informed the police of his resurrection and plan to unleash Knull in such a way as to make Brock look like a raving lunatic, and was imprisoned in Ryker's Island. Still posing as Brock, Kasady was confronted by [[Lee Price (Earth-616)|Lee Price]] - who had formerly hosted the Venom symbiote and was currently the host of the [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Mania symbiote]] - in the prison cafeteria. When Price threatened him, Kasady ripped the Mania symbiote out of him and bonded to it, destroying the security cameras in order to frame Brock. Transforming into Dark Carnage, Kasady slaughtered the inmates in the cafeteria and broke out of the prison; making his way to the mainland and selecting Spider-Man as his next target.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2019 Spider-Man/Venom}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1125429650551910400|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: "Yeah it’s Cletus framing Eddie.

Noticing Eddie Brock and his son [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan]], Cletus pursued them into the subway and pushed Eddie and Dylan in front of an oncoming train - in mockery of what Eddie had once done to Spider-Man. The Venom symbiote rebonded to Eddie and derailed the train to save him and Dylan, and Cletus transformed into Dark Carnage; laughing off Venom's attacks and attempting to rip the Venom symbiote off Eddie so that he could absorb it. Eddie managed to incapacitate Dark Carnage by grabbing onto the third rail - exploiting the Carnagized Grendel symbiote's vulnerability to electricity - but Cletus quickly recovered. Setting his sights on Norman Osborn, Cletus made his way to Ravencroft and activated John Jameson to keep Spider-Man and Venom - who has shown up to protect Osborn - occupied. Cletus infected the inmates with the Carnagized Grendel symbiote - turning them into four-armed red-and-black monsters resembling the Doppelganger - and sicced his army on Spider-Man and Venom before throwing Spider-Man through the door of Osborn's cell. Amused by Osborn believing himself to be Cletus Kasady, Dark Carnage bonded him to the Carnageized Grendel symbiote and turned him into a duplicate of his original Carnage form{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}} - much like what Norman himself had done with his grandson, [[Norman Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Normie Osborn]], to transform him into the Goblin Childe.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800}}

Taking over the asylum and indoctrinating the inmates into his cult, Dark Carnage claimed Shriek's codex and resurrected [[Demogoblin (Earth-616)|Demogoblin]] using her corpse as a vessel.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Lethal Protectors #1}} After Deadpool interrupted the cult's gathering and burned down Ravencroft, Kasady marked him as a priority target due to him having the codex of the [[Hybrid (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Hybrid symbiote]].{{r|Absolute Carnage vs. Deadpool #1}} Growing increasingly annoyed by Osborn's delusion of being Cletus Kasady, Dark Carnage returned to his lair underneath Grand Street and unleashed his horde on the city:{{r|Absolute Carnage #2}} sending the symbiote-doppelgangers to rampage and flush out former hosts in-hiding; "Demagoblin" and Man-Wolf after [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]];{{r|Absolute Carnage: Lethal Protectors #2}} the Knull-corrupted Riot, Agony, Phage, and Lasher after Normie to claim his Carnage codex; and Osborn after the [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Scorpion]] to claim his Venom and Mania codices; and the resurrected Knull-corrupted [[Scream (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Scream]] after Andi Benton to claim her Mania codex.{{r|Venom Vol 4 17}}{{r|Absolute Carnage: Miles Morales #1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage: Scream #1}} He also sent [[Jackson Arvad (Earth-616)|Will o' the Wisp]], [[Conundrum (Earth-616)|Conundrum]] and [[Edward March (Earth-616)|Freak]] after Deadpool, with Osborn arriving soon after.{{r|Absolute Carnage vs. Deadpool Vol 1 2}} When Scream betrayed him, Dark Carnage personally killed its host - [[Patricia Robertson (Earth-616)|Patricia Robertson]] - though the Scream symbiote transferred to Andi Benton, who escaped.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Scream #3}}

Again disguising himself as Eddie Brock, Dark Carnage snuck into the warehouse where Eddie, Spider-Man, and a number of other former symbiote hosts were hiding in to use a machine called the S.C.I.T.H.E, which could non-fatally remove codices. Approached by Spider-Man, who fell for his disguise, Cletus learned that Dylan Brock was Eddie's son. When the real Eddie arrived, accidentally revealing that Spider-Man was Peter Parker, Dark Carnage unveiled himself and summoned a horde of Carnage Doppelgangers to attack the warehouse. The Venom symbiote, tired of Eddie's refusal to face Dark Carnage for fear of orphaning Dylan, decided to bond with [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]], though Carnage killed him in the middle of it. However, as Dark Carnage had no idea who Banner was, he was shocked when Banner resurrected as the Savage Hulk and completed the bonding, delivering a powerful blow that he actually felt.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 3}}

As they battled, Dark Carnage sensed the [[One Below All (Multiverse)|One Below All]]'s power and wondered what would happen if he forced open the Green Door and merged it with Knull's eldritch darkness; though the Venomized Hulk rebuked his offer of an alliance. Stabbing tendrils into the Hulk's brain, Dark Carnage forced him to revert into Bruce Banner and then ripped the Venom symbiote off of him. Assimilating it, Dark Carnage transformed into an even more powerful form sporting draconic wings and horns, and pauldrons and arm-wraps resembling Knull's. With the Carnageized Grendel symbiote now powerful enough to free Knull from his prison, Dark Carnage took off; pursued by Eddie Brock - who had merged the codices harvested using the S.C.I.T.H.E. into [[Venom III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a duplicate of the Venom symbiote]].{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 4}}

As they fought in midair and on the rooftops, Dark Carnage gloated that he was on the cusp of victory and could see his horde about to kill Eddie's allies, telling Eddie to give up and let himself be consumed. Caught off-guard by the sudden arrival of [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]], [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]], [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Firestar]], [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]], [[Henry Hayes (Earth-616)|Deathlok]], [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], Deadpool, and Scream turning the tables; Dark Carnage was tackled through the ground and into the tunnel where Dylan Brock and Normie Osborn were hiding.

Snaring Dylan, Dark Carnage mockingly told Eddie that he had tricked him into claiming the remaining codices and that he now faced a decision in which both choices -- letting Dark Carnage kill Dylan or killing Dark Carnage to save Dylan -- would lead to Knull reawakening. Manifesting a [[Glossary:Necrosword|Necrosword]] from his symbiote, Eddie impaled Dark Carnage before cutting him in half, Cletus' corpse falling apart as the merged Grendel and Venom symbiotes left him for Eddie.{{r|Absolute Carnage #5}}

Despite the death of his physical body, Cletus' consciousness was preserved within the Symbiote Hive-Mind via his codex, enabling him to posthumously control the Grendel symbiote's offshoot.{{r|King in Black Handbook Vol 1 1}}{{r|Carnage: Black, White & Blood Vol 1 2}}{{r|Extreme Carnage Alpha Vol 1 1}} When the Carnage-ized Grendel symbiote bonded to Eddie Brock, Cletus dragged Eddie's consciousness into the Hive-Mind and tormented him with nightmares of his worst fears come to life, intending to control his body and use it to pick up where he'd left off.{{r|Venom Vol 4 24}}{{r|Venom Vol 4 32}}

After Eddie was saved by Dylan and the Venom symbiote, Cletus bonded the Carnage-ized Grendel symbiote to a shark and escaped the Isla de Huesos. After several weeks, Cletus attempted to take part in [[King in Black (Event)|Knull's invasion of Earth]], taking over one of the crew of a whaling ship. However, by that point Eddie had defeated Knull and become the new God of Symbiotes, telepathically telling Cletus that Carnage had no place in his reformed Symbiote Hive. As hundreds of symbiotes controlled by Venom attacked him, Carnage was thrown into the ocean and the Carnage-ized Grendel symbiote was devoured by a horde of symbiote-controlled sharks.{{r|Carnage: Black, White & Blood Vol 1 2}}

===Infection through the Hive-Mind===
Cletus used a surviving piece of the Dark Carnage symbiote to take over a fish before transferring to another great white shark. Swimming to the Indian Ocean, he took over a Somali pirate employed by a local warlord before slaughtering him and his militia, then transferred to an arms dealer employed by [[Alchemax (Earth-616)|Alchemax]]. En route to New York, Cletus devoured the crew of the plane before eating a driver who mistook him for a "Doctor Miller".<!--{{r|Extreme Carnage Alpha Vol 1 1}}--> 

Inspired by Eddie having become the new King in Black, Cletus used the power bequeathed to him by Knull to seize control of some of the symbiotes that had been left behind on Earth, unsuccessfully attempting to take over Flash Thompson's [[Anti-Venom II (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom symbiote]]. Consuming the Alchemax arms-dealer from the inside, Cletus planned to take control of [[Peter Krane (Earth-616)|Senator Peter Krane]] - a member of the [[Friends of Humanity (Earth-616)|Friends of Humanity]] who was plotting to use the growing anti-extraterrestrial sentiment to enhance his political career and run for President - and lured Flash into a trap at one of Krane's political rallies.{{r|Extreme Carnage Alpha Vol 1 1}} 

Coinciding with a televised broadcast of one of Krane's interviews, Carnage reached out to the [[Phage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Phage symbiote]], corrupting it and directing it to bond to [[Buck Cashman (Earth-616)|Buck Cashman]], who joined the Friends of Humanity as Peter Krane's head of security.{{r|Extreme Carnage: Phage Vol 1 1}} Carnage also reached out to the [[Lasher (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Lasher symbiote]] - which had taken [[Lasher (William) (Earth-616)|William]], an old man with dementia, as its host - but it refused to join him. Cletus exploited William's desire to regain his memories in order to lure him to Washington, D.C., William's body perishing at some point during the days-long journey. Confronting William's codex within the Hive-Mind, Carnage thanked him for bringing Lasher to his "family" before killing him.{{r|Extreme Carnage: Lasher Vol 1 1}} 

Carnage's attempt to corrupt the Scream symbiote was thwarted by Andi Benton, leading Carnage to dispatch Phage to assassinate her after she was arrested by [[Alchemax (Earth-616)|Alchemax]].{{r|Extreme Carnage: Scream Vol 1 1}}{{r|Extreme Carnage: Phage Vol 1 1}} While Phage was able to badly injure Andi, the intervention of Agent Anti-Venom led to her bonding to [[Silence (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Silence]], a new symbiote created from Scream's remains and a sample of Anti-Venom, and almost killing Phage with her cleansing touch.{{r|Extreme Carnage: Lasher Vol 1 1}}

Having his bloodline tainted by [[Cortland Kasady (Earth-616)|his distant ancestor]],{{r|Ruins of Ravencroft: Carnage Vol 1 1}} Cletus Kasady was destined to be a nihilistic yet also gleefully sadistic and ruthless sociopath with an insatiable bloodlust, ostensibly stemming from a vision he had of the dark elder god Knull when he was an infant.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 3}}{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} However, despite his insistence otherwise,{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 3}} Cletus was not born a monster. While he displayed sociopathic tendencies - namely mutilating and killing his mother's dog, and being enraptured by the Zapruder film - these were nurtured by the physical and psychological abuse at the hands of his [[Nana (Cletus' Grandmother) (Earth-616)|grandmother]], [[Roscoe Kasady (Earth-616)|father]], and the staff and other orphans at [[St. Estes Home for Boy]];{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 203}}{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited Vol 1 2}}{{r|Carnage Vol 2 12}} Despite his antisocial tendencies, Cletus was genuinely happy to have made a friend in the form of [[Billy Bentine (Earth-616)|Billy Bentine]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 28}} One of Cletus' repressed memories shows him as a teenager, distraught at being rejected by a girl who said he'd changed after dropping out of school.{{r|Carnage: It's a Wonderful Life Vol 1 1}}

As an adult, Cletus came to delight in wanton bloodshed - seeing murder as an art-form to be cultivated - and worship the ideal of chaos through random acts of violence; believing that laws and order are meaningless constructions, and that by killing others he is freeing them.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 344}}{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 1}}{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} Cletus gleeful bloodlust and extreme nihilism leading many leading psychiatrists - including [[Ashley Kafka (Earth-616)|Ashley Kafka]] and [[Matthew Kurtz (Earth-616)|Matthew Kurtz]] - to assume he was either simply born evil or that his symbiote had suppressed whatever humanity remained within him; and he cultivated his mindscape into a nightmarish charnel house, repressing any happy memories from his childhood - such as his friendship with Billy - within its depths.{{r|Carnage: Mind Bomb Vol 1 1}}{{r|Carnage: It's a Wonderful Life Vol 1 1}}

As a result of his insatiable bloodlust, any alliances Carnage makes are short-lived at best - usually ending in him turning on his allies in order to kill them. He once formed a team of bloodthirsty supervillains to assist him in [[Maximum Carnage (Event)|conquering Manhattan]], intending to kill them once he grew bored.{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited Vol 1 1}} He also briefly allied himself with [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]] for the sake of aiding in his attempted invasion of Earth, later betraying him in the hopes of killing trillions of people at once.{{r|Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man Vol 1 14}} When briefly consumed by a Poison, Kasady's sheer bloodlust enabled his consciousness to subjugate that of the Poison; and he feigned loyalty to the Hive while in the presence of the Poison Queen, but quickly went rogue in order to pursue and fight against Venom and Spider-Man.{{r|{{cl|Venomized Vol 1 4}}-[[Venomized Vol 1 5|5]]}}

When struck by the [[Illuminizer Ray]] amplified by Iron Fist's chi, Dagger's Lightforce, and - unintentionally - Shriek's psionic abilities, Cletus was forced to experience hope, compassion, and the possibility of healing and redemption - concepts that were anathema to him after years of abuse and bloodlust. This experience briefly left him traumatized, causing him to flee in terror at the thought of being killed by Venom and hallucinate the ghosts of his past tormenters - who he had murdered years ago - mocking him.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 203}}{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited Vol 1 2}}

After having his moral alignment inverted following [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]], Kasady desired to do good and repent for the monstrous acts he had committed, struggling to suppress his bloodlust and avoid killing.{{r|AXIS: Carnage Vol 1 1}} While he was able to "atone" by feeding his sins to [[Sin-Eater (AXIS) (Earth-616)|the demonic Sin Eater]],{{r|AXIS: Carnage Vol 1 3}} and attempted to sacrifice himself; his moral inversion ultimately wore off and became something Kasady considered a humiliation.{{r|Nova Vol 5 25}}

At various times, Cletus has shown greater ambitions than wanton slaughter - attempting to conquer Doverton, Colorado and the Microverse - but he later dismissed these megalomaniacal endeavors as fool's errands and opted to go back to basics.{{r|Superior Carnage Annual Vol 1 1}} While he attempted to unleash the eldritch god [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]] in order to bring about the end of the world, expecting to be granted even greater power in exchange for his services; he made no effort to ally himself with the [[Darkholders (Earth-616)|Darkhold Cult]] - largely because they intended to sacrifice him.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 15}} After bonding to [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|an offshoot]] the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel symbiote]] and being pronounced the Prophet of the Void by the [[Cult of Knull (Earth-616)|Cult of Knull]], Cletus zealously devoted himself to Knull;{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} desiring to become the King in Black's lieutenant and take part in his annihilation of the universe,{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 2}} even to the point of allowing Venom to kill him in order to ensure Knull's revival.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5}} As his connection to Knull increased, Cletus developed a god-complex to the point of deifying himself even before the Grendel symbiote offshoot's godly power was fully restored.{{r|Web of Venom: Cult of Carnage Vol 1 1}}{{r|Web of Venom: Funeral Pyre Vol 1 1}}

Cletus has only shown genuine affection to two individuals -- Shriek and the Carnage symbiote. While Cletus originally intended to kill Shriek when he grew bored of her,{{r|Carnage Vol 1 3}} he was enraged when Deadpool attempted to kill her and tricked him into nearly doing so,{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 4}} and was similarly outraged when the [[Miles Warren (Earth-616)|Jackal]] beat and forcibly removed the [[Carrion]] virus from her while the two of them were imprisoned in Ravencroft.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 223}} Cletus sees his symbiote as his soul mate and part of his true self - to the point of referring to it with female pronouns and calling it his "missus" after it spawned the Toxin symbiote.{{r|Superior Carnage Annual Vol 1 1}}{{r|Carnage, U.S.A. Vol 1 1}} When bonded to a new symbiote by the Poisons after being separated from the Carnage symbiote, Cletus was outraged and demanded that the new symbiote be removed and his original symbiote be returned to him;{{r|Venomized Vol 1 3}} and he was distraught when the Carnage symbiote perished attempting to save him from atmospheric reentry.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} During the time he was inverted, Cletus latched on to [[Alice Gleason (Earth-616)|Alice Gleason]] to the extent that he fantasized about marrying and having children with her, though this was one-sided and Gleason was revolted by him.{{r|AXIS: Carnage Vol 1 3}}

| Powers                  = Prior to its death, the [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage symbiote]] provided Cletus Kasady with a broad array of powers, some of which stemmed from [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|its progenitor]] having been bonded to Spider-Man. Even without the symbiote, Cletus is still considered very dangerous, as his Antisocial Personality Disorder and obsession with chaos make him impossible to reason with and he has no trouble with killing with no motive. As a result of his symbiote and psychopathy, he is also immune to Ghost Rider's [[Glossary:Penance Stare|Penance Stare]].{{r|Absolute Carnage: Symbiote of Vengeance Vol 1 1}} After his death, Cletus became a [[Glossary:Symbiote Codex|codex]] within the Symbiote Hive-Mind, but was still able to act in the physical world by piloting the [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carange-ized offshoot]] of the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]],{{r|Venom Vol 4 22}} and by using the power he'd been granted by [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] to subjugate other symbiotes to his will.{{r|Extreme Carnage Alpha Vol 1 1}}

'''Knull's Empowerment:''' Being bonded to [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|an offshoot]] of the [[Symbiote Dragons|symbiote-dragon]] known as the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]] metaphysically connected Cletus to the dark elder god [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], effectively turning Cletus into a demigod as that connection grew stronger.{{r|Web of Venom: Funeral Pyre Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5}} Even after his death, Cletus' [[Glossary:Symbiote Codex|codex]] was able to use the power he'd been granted by Knull to maintain a presence in the physical world.{{r|Extreme Carnage Alpha Vol 1 1}}
* '''Symbiote Domination:''' Inspired by the newly-apotheosized Eddie Brock's ability to command and control other symbiotes, Cletus used the power bequeathed to him by Knull in order to do the same, subjugating many of the symbiotes left behind on Earth to his will and bloodlust in order to create a rival Hive.{{r|Extreme Carnage Alpha Vol 1 1}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Powers
| body  = '''[[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Red-and-Black Symbiotic Costume]]:''' Kasady possessed various superhuman attributes as a result of bonding with the Carnage symbiote, which covers his body in red and black biomass formed from a combination of his blood and living abyss. Most of his powers are similar to those possessed by Spider-Man and Venom, although it possesses several unique abilities variously attributed to its gestation on Earth and to Kasady's insatiable bloodlust, which the symbiote imprinted upon when it bonded to him.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 1}} However, the portion of the Carnage symbiote bonded to Cletus was ultimately destroyed when it tried to shield him from atmospheric re-entry.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}}
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' Carnage is superhumanly strong. He has shown himself to be stronger than Spider-Man and Venom combined and can lift about [[Strength Scale#50|80 tons]];{{r|New Avengers Most Wanted Files Vol 1 1}} this is not his true limit, as his strength increases with his size and variable muscle mass. Kasady himself, however, has the strength of a regular human being.
* '''Superhuman Speed:''' Carnage can run and move at speeds superior to those of any normal human being. At one time, he managed to evade a microwave-based attack from [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Firestar]].{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 202}}
* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Kasady's musculature generates considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. He can physically exert himself at peak capacity for about 24 hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his bloodstream begins to impair his function.
* '''Superhuman Agility:''' Kasady's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.
* '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Kasady's reflexes are similarly enhanced and are superior to those of the finest human athlete, and even superior to those of Spider-Man.
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' The tissue the symbiote is composed of renders Kasady's body much harder and more resistant to physical injury than the body of an ordinary human. Kasady can withstand high caliber bullets, great impact forces, powerful energy blasts, and falls from great heights without sustaining significant physical injury.
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' While it is possible to injure Kasady through the symbiote, he is able to rapidly regenerate damaged bodily tissues much faster and more extensively than an ordinary human. He can fully regenerate severed limbs or missing internal organs; and appears to have regrown the lower half of his body,{{r|Superior Carnage #1}}{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage #1}} and regrown his head completely in a matter of seconds after having it blown off by Alice Gleason.{{r|AXIS: Carnage #3}} In the Microverse, Carnage was able to regrow his entire body from his severed head after being decapitated by Venom.{{r|Venom Vol 2 27}} Kasady is also immune to the effects of all Earthly diseases and infections as long as he remains bonded with the symbiote.
* '''Wall Crawling:''' Much like Spider-Man, Kasady has the ability to cling to virtually any surface. He can rapidly crawl, walk, or run across even slickened surfaces.
* '''Webbing:''' Kasady can project a powerful, organic web-like substance similar to the webbing Spider-Man has. He typically uses this webbing to swing from building to building or as a means of immobilizing someone. The webbing is exceptionally strong, much more than even the finest human athlete can break.
* '''Camouflage Capabilities:''' The symbiote possesses limited shape-shifting abilities in the sense that it can immediately change itself to appear as any type of clothing or garment that Kasady wishes.
* '''Constituent Matter Generation:''' Kasady can generate tentacle-like appendages from various parts of his body, which he often uses either in combat situations or to restrain someone.
* '''Constituent-Matter Manipulation:''' Kasady can morph sections of his body, such as his hands or feet, into bladed weaponry such as spikes, blades, or axes. Kasady can also detach this bladed weaponry if he chooses to. For example, he often forms spikes that he expels from his body. The weaponry, however, disintegrates after being separated from his body after a period of about 30 seconds.
* '''Full Body Perception:''' In lieu of a Spider-Sense, Carnage is able to see and sense oncoming threats out of any part of the symbiote.
* '''Symbiotic Expansion and Psychic Control:''' Kasady has been shown to be capable of expanding his symbiote's mass by feeding it nutrients and mass from, for example, piles of dead animals. This allows him to move his symbiote through an entire town and take control over the civilians, and even some of the Avengers.{{r|{{cl|Carnage, U.S.A. Vol 1 1}}-[[Carnage, U.S.A. Vol 1 5|5]]}} While he seemingly lost this power after the symbiote was chemically neutered by [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]],{{r|Superior Carnage Annual Vol 1 1}} he regained a modified version of it via exposure to the [[Darkhold]].{{r|Carnage Vol 2 4}}
* '''Immunity to Spider-Man's Spider-Sense:''' Due to the Carnage symbiote being a child of the Venom symbiote, Carnage can't be detected by Spider-Man's Spider-Sense.
* '''[[Darkhold]] Augmentation:''' After his symbiote-infused blood came into contact with the [[Darkhold]], Carnage regained the ability to spread his symbiote to other people and control them.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 4}} He additionally lost his vulnerability to sonic attacks and gained the ability to sense the eldritch tome's location.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 5}}

'''[[Carnage III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Black-and-Red Symbiotic Costume]]:''' Upon discovering that Kasady no longer possessed the Carnage symbiote, Poison Doctor Doom forcibly bonded him to a symbiote that had been stolen from the planet [[Klyntar (Location)|Klyntar]] and genetically altered to reduce the time required for it to bond to a host, make it more difficult to remove from its host, and render it resilient to heat and sonics. The remnants of his original symbiote in Kasady's blood unsuccessfully attempted to reject the new symbiote, as did Kasady himself, to no avail.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 1|2}} Upon bonding to him, the new symbiote granted Kasady all the powers the original Carnage symbiote had possessed, covering his body in black biomass with red eyespots and markings. Outraged, Cletus intended to hunt down and reclaim the original Carnage symbiote, who he referred to as his "true self." However, this symbiote was consumed by a [[Poison]], giving rise to Poison Carnage.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 3}} For the brief period he was bonded to it, the symbiote grants Cletus the following powers:
* '''Superhuman Strength'''
* '''Superhuman Durability'''
* '''Superhuman Stamina'''
* '''Superhuman Speed'''
* '''Superhuman Agility'''
* '''Superhuman Reflexes'''
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor'''
* '''Wall-Crawling'''
* '''Genetic Memory'''
* '''Empathic Empowerment'''
* '''Constituent-Matter Generation'''
* '''Shapeshifting'''

'''Poison Physiology:''' Since Cletus Kasady's body was assimilated by a [[Poison]] but his consciousness persisted, Carnage possesses all of its abilities. Poisons obtain the powers of the beings they assimilate, so Kasady's powers remained presumably mostly unchanged, though he was far more powerful as a Poison than he was with just a symbiote:
* '''Superhuman Strength'''
* '''Superhuman Durability'''
* '''Superhuman Stamina'''
* '''Superhuman Speed'''
* '''Superhuman Agility'''
* '''Superhuman Reflexes'''
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor'''
* '''Wall-Crawling'''
* '''Genetic Memory'''
* '''Constituent-Matter Generation'''
* '''Shapeshifting'''

'''[[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Primordial Symbiotic Costume]]:''' After the death of the original Carnage symbiote, Cletus Kasady was bonded to an offshoot of the primordial Grendel symbiote by [[Cult of Knull (Earth-616)|a cult]] dedicated to worshipping the dark elder god [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]. While initially transforming the Grendel symbiote offshoot to match the original Carnage symbiote's appearance,{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} after absorbing more codices and strengthening his connection to Knull, Carnage manifested the elder god's spiral sigil on his forehead.{{r|Web of Venom: Funeral Pyre Vol 1 1}} After absorbing numerous other codices and the Mania symbiote, he manifested a dragon/spider emblem on his chest and a pair of protrusions on his upper back.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2019 Spider-Man/Venom}} Even in this incomplete state, Dark Carnage's connections to Chthon through the curse of the ''Darkhold'' and Knull through the Carnageized Grendel symbiote effectively made him a demigod possessing power far beyond what a regular symbiote bestows its host.{{r|Web of Venom: Funeral Pyre Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}} After assimilating even more codices and the Venom symbiote, Cletus restored the symbiote's full godly power and manifested black draconic horns, black pauldrons and arm-wraps resembling Knull's, and became able to transform his now-pointed back-protrusions into draconic wings. Being bonded to - and later indwelling - the Carnageized Grendel symbiote grants Cletus the following powers:
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' As Dark Carnage, Cletus' strength surpasses even that of the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Devil Hulk]] and [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]];{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}}{{r|{{cite web|url=http://stegmanandfriends.podbean.com/e/abscarn-boiz-wdonny-cates-absolute-carnage-1-chapter-one-directors-commentary/|title=ABSCARN BOIZ! w/Donny Cates: “Absolute Carnage” #1- Chapter One Director’s Commentary|work=PodBean|first=Ryan Stegman|last=Griffin Sheridan|date=August 31, 2019|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}}} letting him easily manhandle [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]] and the symbiote-augmented [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]. Dark Carnage was even capable of overpowering the Hulk while the latter was augmented by the Venom symbiote, and after absorbing the Venom symbiote to become even stronger he fought and effortlessly defeated Captain America, Wolverine, and the Thing simultaneously.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 4}}
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' Dark Carnage was capable of effortlessly shrugging off blows from [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]] and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}} While the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Savage Hulk]] was able to hit Dark Carnage hard enough for him to feel it while augmented by the Venom symbiote,{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 3}} he was unable to actually injure him during their brawl. He was also durable enough to withstand blows from Captain America, Wolverine, and the Thing attacking him simultaneously.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 4}}
* '''Superhuman Stamina'''
* '''Superhuman Speed'''
* '''Superhuman Agility'''
* '''Superhuman Reflexes'''
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor'''
* '''Wall-Crawling'''
* '''Hive Mind Connection:''' The Carnageized Grendel symbiote possesses a psychic link to [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], and if this link is strengthened by absorbing enough codices and symbiotes then it can be used to awaken him and free him from [[Klyntar (Location)|his prison]].{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}}
* '''Fangs and Claws'''
* '''Constituent-Matter Generation:''' Kasady can generate tentacle-like appendages from various parts of his body, which he often uses either in combat situations or to restrain someone.
* '''Shapeshifting:''' Carnage is capable of altering his appearance at will, using this to assume his non-undead appearance, as well as to impersonate Eddie Brock in order to kill Lee Price.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2019 Spider-Man/Venom}} After absorbing the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]] he became able to manifest draconic wings.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5}}
* '''Symbiotic Expansion and Psychic Control:''' Carnage is able to infect and enslave others with symbiote-infected maggots he calls "brain worms";{{r|Web of Venom: Unleashed Vol 1 1}} and can bond people and animals to offshoots of the Grendel symbiote both in order to create more codices to harvest and to turn them into minions he can control.{{r|Web of Venom: Unleashed Vol 1 1}}{{r|Web of Venom: Cult of Carnage Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}}
* '''Symbiote and Codex Absorption/Augmentation:''' By consuming the codices of other symbiotes and even entire symbiotes,{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2019 Spider-Man/Venom}} Dark Carnage is able to strengthen the Grendel symbiote's connection to the symbiote hive-mind and [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], incrementally making him more powerful with every codex assimilated.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} By consuming the codices of superpowered hosts, the symbiote is temporarily imbued with whatever unique powers they possessed.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Symbiote of Vengeance Vol 1 1}} If Dark Carnage absorbs enough codices and symbiotes, he will strengthen his symbiote to the point where he effectively becomes a god himself.{{r|Web of Venom: Funeral Pyre Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 4}}
'''Darkhold Augmentation:''' After the ''[[Darkhold]]'' was exposed to his blood, Cletus Kasady was connected to the eldritch god [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]]. As a result of being empowered by it, the [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage symbiote]] became immune to fire and sonics,{{r|Carnage Vol 2 4}}{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} an immunity passed down to the [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Dark Carnage symbiote]] after it bonded to Kasady.{{r|Web of Venom: Funeral Pyre Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 3}}


'''[[Spirits of Vengeance (Earth-616)|Spirit of Vengeance]]:''' After consuming [[Alejandra Jones (Earth-616)|Alejandra Jones]]' spine, Carnage was temporarily imbued with the power of her Spirit of Vengeance, granting him all of the powers and abilities of a Ghost Rider.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Symbiote of Vengeance Vol 1 1}}

| Abilities               = Though he has had no formal training, the natural abilities granted to Kasady by the symbiote makes him a formidable combatant capable of holding his own against the likes of Spider-Man and Deadpool. However, even with the symbiote, his fighting skill is less refined than that of the experienced superheroes.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 2}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 11}}{{r|Deadpool Corps: Rank and Foul Vol 1 1}} Even Eddie Brock and Patrick Mulligan have had more practice.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 12}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 14}}
| Strength                = Carnage's strength is greater than Venom and Spider-Man combined. Carnage is able to press lift up to 80 tons.{{r|New Avengers Most Wanted Files Vol 1 1}} This is not his true limit, however, as his strength increases with his size and variable muscle mass.

| Weaknesses              = '''Insanity:''' Even without the symbiote, Cletus is a diagnosed psychopath, and is obsessed with chaos. His mental pathologies can also be exploited, allowing people to manipulate his actions.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 1}}

'''Electricity:''' The Grendel symbiote is immensely vulnerable to high voltages of electricity, which easily incapacitates it.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}}

'''Sonics:''' The Grendel symbiote is vulnerable to loud noises, which incapacitate it and its offshoots.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Lethal Protectors Vol 1 1}}

| body  = '''Heat:''' The Carnage symbiote, like all others of its kind, is extremely vulnerable to heat and sonic based attacks. They can cause the symbiote physical pain and discomfort, whereas "more powerful" attacks might be completely ineffective. After being empowered by the ''[[Darkhold]]'',{{r|Carnage Vol 2 6}} Carnage was no longer vulnerable to sonic attacks and his weakness towards heat was diminished - being roasted on a stone slab caused him excruciating pain, and the Carnage symbiote was killed by atmospheric re-entry.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 5}}{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} When bonded to the Grendel symbiote as Dark Carnage, Kasady was completely immune to heat-based attacks, being capable of withstanding [[Hellfire]] without injury. Kasady ascribed this to him being cursed by the power of the ''Darkhold'' and his connection to the dark elder god [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]].{{r|Web of Venom: Funeral Pyre Vol 1 1}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cullenbunn/status/1160542963354755072|title=Cullen Bunn on Twitter: "@PolvoAranha1 Maybe...

| Notes                   = * Cletus Kasady has bonded to at least four symbiotes over the course of his life and undeath: his [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|original symbiote]] - seemingly extracted and assimilated by [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom]], a [[Carnage II (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|replacement symbiote]] he found in the [[Negative Zone]], a [[Carnage III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|third symbiote]] forcibly bonded to him and later consumed by the [[Poisons]], and [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|an offshoot]] of the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]] [[Symbiote Dragons|symbiote-dragon]].{{r|King in Black Handbook Vol 1 1}} Narratives such as ''[[Venom Vs. Carnage Vol 1|Venom Vs. Carnage]]'', ''[[Superior Carnage Vol 1|Superior Carnage]]'', and [[Venom Vol 4|''Venom'' Vol. 4]] treat his original symbiote and the Negative Zone symbiote as one-and-the-same, leaving it possible that the [[Glossary:Symbiote Codex|remnants of the original symbiote]] in Cletus' blood overtook the second one, but an official in-universe explanation has not yet been given.
* When asked why ''[[Absolute Carnage]]'' referred to the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel symbiote]] as being the "[[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage symbiote]]" when it was bonded to Cletus Kasady, writer Donny Cates stated that any symbiote that Cletus Kasady bonds to becomes the "Carnage symbiote" due to him having been the one who first came up with the alias.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://stegmanandfriends.com/e/abscarn-boiz-wdonny-cates-absolute-carnage-wrap-up-retrospective/|title=ABSCARN BOIZ! w/Donny Cates: “Absolute Carnage” Wrap-Up Retrospective|work=PodBean|first= Ryan Stegman|last= Griffin Sheridan|date=November 24, 2019|accessdate=November 25, 2019}}}}
* The handbooks have been inconsistent regarding Carnage's official stats, particularly his strength level. For instance, {{cl|New Avengers Most Wanted Files #1}} described him as being capable of lifting up to 80 tons with his original symbiote; while the {{cl|King in Black Handbook #1}} described him as only being capable of lifting between 10 and 50 tons with his original symbiote and only 75 tons with the Carnageized Grendel symbiote despite him being stated to be stronger than any foe [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]] had fought previously -- including the likes of the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] and [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Merged Hulk]] -- and being shown overpowering [[Clayton Cortez (Earth-616)|Weapon H]], the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venomized]] Savage Hulk, and the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] while not at full power. 
* Despite having been established as being born in New York, Cletus has occasionally been depicted as speaking a Southern accent and being a supporter of the [[Confederate States of America]], and has been called a hillbilly.{{r|Carnage Vol 1 4}}{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 1}}{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #8}}{{r|Nova Vol 5 27}}
* Despite his prosthetic legs being destroyed in {{cl|Carnage, U.S.A. Vol 1 5}}, Cletus is shown with flesh-and-blood legs in ''[[Minimum Carnage]]'', ''[[Superior Carnage Vol 1|Superior Carnage]]'', and ''[[Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1|Deadpool vs. Carnage]]'' - having regrown his entire body after being decapitated in {{cl|Venom Vol 2 27}}. He re-appears with robotic legs in ''[[Nova Vol 5|Nova]]'', and the pages of [[Carnage Vol 2|the second volume of ''Carnage'']], ''[[Venomized Vol 1|Venomized]]'', and ''[[Absolute Carnage]]'' show Kasady to be missing most of his legs without his symbiote, indicating he lost them when attempting to sacrifice himself in {{cl|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #8}}.
* The symbol on Dark Carnage's chest is meant to be a white version of [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]'s dragon emblem, though numerous artists have mistakenly drawn it as [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom]]/[[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Mania]]'s spider emblem.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://stegmanandfriends.podbean.com/e/abscarn-boiz-wdonny-cates-absolute-carnage-1-chapter-one-directors-commentary/|title=

* The {{cl|King in Black Handbook Vol 1 1}} states that Cletus, while bonded to the [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Dark Carnage symbiote]], was able to lift a maximum of 75 tons, but this is contradicted by Venom's statement in {{cl|King in Black Vol 1 1}} that Dark Carnage was stronger than any enemy he'd fight before - including the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Merged Hulk]] and [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]], and his ability to fight evenly with the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]]-augmented Savage Hulk and casually overpower the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]].

| Trivia                  = * As part of their sensationalization of Carnage as the chosen one of the dark elder god [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]],{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1174368004538347520|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: "The part where “Knull resurrected him as a baby” is completely untrue. Remember, that “new origin” was being told to us by a deranged cult leader spinning their own new gospel. Ya gotta pay attention to all them little words next to the pictures sometimes, folks."|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=September 18, 2019|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}}} the [[Cult of Knull (Earth-616)|Cult of Knull]] fabricated a story that Kasady died of nuchal cord strangulation nineteen minutes after being born, only to be resurrected by Knull, an experience that allegedly proved to be the impetus towards both his bloodlust and obsession with chaos.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 3}}
* Cletus Kasady has bonded with the most number of symbiotes out of any human, surpassing even Eddie Brock. The symbiotes he has bonded to include the [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|original Carnage symbiote]], countless symbiotes he assimilated into the Carnage symbiote during the [[Planet of the Symbiotes (Event)|Planet of the Symbiotes]] event, numerous hybridized clones of the Carnage and Venom symbiotes, the [[Carnage II (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|second]], [[Carnage III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|third]] and [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|fourth]] Carnage symbiotes, and the [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Mania]] and [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom]] symbiotes through absorbing them into the Dark Carnage symbiote.
* According to [[Ryan Stegman]], Cletus Kasady's body count numbers from the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://stegmanandfriends.podbean.com|title=VENOM BOIZ! w/Donny Cates: Venom #1 Q and A|work=PodBean|first= Ryan Stegman|last= Griffin Sheridan|date=June 29, 2019|accessdate=July 2, 2019}}}}
* Kasady had a teddy bear named Binky in his orphanage. He went back for Binky after he escaped Riker's.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #361}}
* Cletus was revealed to have terminal stomach cancer in the issues where the symbiote bonded to the Silver Surfer, though it hasn't come up since.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #430|431}}
* Cletus has erroneously been depicted with blond hair in {{cl|Carnage: It's a Wonderful Life Vol 1 1}}, {{cl|Spider-Man Vol 1 36}} and {{cl|Minimum Carnage: Omega Vol 1 1}}, as opposed to his usual red hair.
* Cletus alternatively refers to the Carnage symbiote with female{{r|Carnage #3}}{{r|Superior Carnage Annual #1}} and male pronouns.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 6}}
* Cletus' favorite song is "Free Bird" by [[Lynyrd Skynyrd (Earth-616)|Lynyrd Skynyrd]].{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #8}}
* Cletus is a fan of the thrash metal group [[Anthrax (Rock Band) (Earth-616)|Anthrax]], the symbiote often making him listen to it with headphones.{{r|Nova Vol 5 27}}
* Carnage is the main villain on 2002's ''Universal Halloween Horror Nights'', which was based on [[Maximum Carnage (Event)|Maximum Carnage]]. However, Cletus managed to kill every hero who went after him (like Spider-Man, Wolverine, Captain America) and, with the help of other villains, took over the world.
* It has been a point of contention among fans as to whether Cletus regrew his lower body after having been torn in half at the waist by the Sentry or whether the instances where he was shown with flesh-and-blood legs were simply him using the symbiote to simulate them. However, his legless state while stripped of the symbiote in ''Carnage'' Vol. 2, {{cl|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}}, and ''Absolute Carnage'' do not match his state in ''Carnage'' Vol. 1 and ''Carnage, U.S.A.''.
* Carnage is regarded as a messiah figure by two different apocalyptic cults dedicated to worshipping evil [[elder gods]], the [[Darkholders (Earth-616)|Darkholders]] and the [[Cult of Knull (Earth-616)|Cult of Knull]], having been prophesied to free both [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]] and [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] from their respective prisons. Both deities are inspired in part by elements from the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].
* While it is implied {{cl|Web of Venom: Cult of Carnage Vol 1 1}} that Cletus was resurrected, Donny Cates revealed in a podcast that he is undead, having been reanimated by the Grendel symbiote.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://stegmanandfriends.podbean.com|title=VENOM BOIZ! w/Donny Cates: Road to “Absolute Carnage”|work=PodBean|first= Ryan Stegman|last=Griffin Sheridan|date=July 28, 2019|accessdate=July 29, 2019}}}}
* When asked on Twitter if Dark Carnage's fifth form had a unique name, Ryan Stegman coined "Devil Carnage" and was pleasantly surprised when the fandom embraced and began using it.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RyanStegman/status/1184536446981595137|title=ryan stegman on Twitter: "@Exastiken DEVIL CARNAGE.

* According to Donny Cates on Twitter, Cletus' middle name is "Cortland," after his [[Cortland Kasady (Earth-616)|great-great-great-great-grandfather]].{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1258656216924016640|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: "Cortland. after his great Great great great grandfather.
