| History                 = Kirren didn't like to gossip and yelled at [[Tolos (Earth-616)|Tolos]] when he involved him in the latest gossip about their [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|king]] sleeping in different chamber than his wives. He didn't want to end up like Tolos and get the worse shift in guard duty.

Both Tolos and Kirrien were seemingly killed by an [[Outriders (Race)|Outrider]] which had just snuck on Black Bolt's chamber.{{r|Infinity #1}}
