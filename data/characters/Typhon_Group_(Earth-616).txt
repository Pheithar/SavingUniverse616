It's one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. A major provider of cost-negative vaccinations in some of the most needy places in the world. It has received praise from the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions, the African National Human Rights Institutions, and the Network of National Institutions in the Americas.

Unknown to most of the world, it is the premiere creator and manufacturer of military-grade
chemical weapons. Among Typhon's clients are the US Army and Marine Corps, the British
Army, the Royal Australian Air Force, the Russian Navy, the German Bundeswehr, and
the Chinese People's Liberation Army.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 1}}
