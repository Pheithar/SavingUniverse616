| History                 = E.V.A. was grown in the body of the man known as [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]]. She was a physical manifestation of his nervous system and hadn't gained sentience. At this time, resembled a sentient techno-organic ship with insect-like legs for landing. E.V.A. could fly and generate electrical charges as a weapon.{{r|New X-Men #129|130}}

[[File:E.V.A. (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 27 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Humanoid form]]
===X-Force===
E.V.A. helped X-Force whilst Fantomex was a member.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #1}} When he was killed by [[Harry Pizer (Earth-616)|Skinless Man]], she saved [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]], and then mutated into a humanoid form.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #27}} After Fantomex was resurrected, he was separated into three distinct bodies for each of his three brains. E.V.A. retained the ability to assume her humanoid form as well as her spaceship form for a time.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #35}} The full effect of Fantomex's separation on E.V.A. wasn't clear. She initially sided with Fantomex and Cluster against Weapon XIII.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 #2}}

===Cable's X-Force===
When Fantomex lost track of Cluster and became part of Cable's X-Force team, E.V.A. came with him.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 #1|2}} However, the instability that affected Fantomex after his tri-separation apparently impacted E.V.A. as well. When Fantomex's hardwired self-confidence was contradicted by the mistakes he made in reality, he began to suffer a mental breakdown. E.V.A. helped "fix" him by suggesting he murder everyone who appeared "better" than him, so that by default he would be "the best" again.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 #4}}

Fantomex was eventually stopped when Hope Summers implanted into his mind the thought that in order to be perfect, a person needed inadequacies and personal faults. Fantomex couldn't comprehend being perfect through imperfection and suffered a mental break down, having E.V.A purge him of all flaws afflicting him along with his almighty attributes. Psylocke then used her psychic blades to scramble his brains, seemingly severing his connection to E.V.A.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 #15}} When Fantomex was restored to normalcy by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 8}} E.V.A. was also returned to her previous form.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 5}}

===Civil War II===
Some time after their neruo-psychic link was reestablished, E.V.A assisted Magneto's faction of X-Men to waylay the [[House of Agon|Inhumans]] when the mutant radical decided that the future seer [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses]] was too dangerous to be left in their care.{{r|Civil War II: X-Men Vol 1 3|4}} Later again she assisted Fantomex in the X-Men's conflict with the denizens of [[New Attilan]] in an attempt to dispose of the [[Terrigen]] Cloud covering the globe.{{r|IvX Vol 1 5}}

===X and the Weapon + Program===
Fantomex would willingly chose to forfeit his physical body to the wayward consciousness of Charles Xavier while he himself lived a fantasy like life within the astral plane.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 9}} 

[[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|X]]'s occupation of her old hosts form freed the symbiotic entity from its moorings; said hosting organism taking off at an unknown time. She only turned up again in a damaged form to deliver a prerecorded message of its now deceased partner to [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], both products of the [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus]] initiative.{{r|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}

'''Flight:''' E.V.A. can propel herself and fly through the air at great speeds.

'''Scanning Replication:''' Working in conjunction with Fantomex's Cybernetic Brains, E.V.A can analyze and copy any manner of information be it [[Super-Soldier Serum|chemical or genetic]] in origin, and transfer it into binary coding for him to use and re-purpose for his benefit.

'''Technological Interfacing'''

'''Neuroweapons System:''' Fantomex can user her as a form of bio-mechanical arsenal, either flinging pieces of it/her like high velocity darts or E.V.A herself discharging electrostatic blasts that can stun and immobilize.

'''Size Shifting'''

'''Illusions:''' Together, with [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]], they could create extremely convincing illusions.
