| History                 = Koyami Sazaki was a 23 year old graduate physics student on Counter-Earth who was investigating a radiological anomaly before it destroyed that earth's Tokyo. Koyami was transformed into Anomaly and was unhinged by the loss of his parents. [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Helmut Zemo]] offered Anomaly the chance to save Counter-Earth at the expense of the original Earth. Eventually Helmut saw the error of his ways, and Anomaly was defeated by the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] and [[Young Allies (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Young Allies]] and sucked into the anomaly that was eating away at both Earths. Helmut speculated that Anomaly could reconstruct himself and would be back.
