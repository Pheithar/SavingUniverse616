| History                 = Agent Madrox was a duplicate of [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Madrox Prime]], originally sent out to study espionage. He made contact with [[Valerie Cooper (Earth-616)|Val Cooper]], who set him up with her connections at [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #8}}

Agent Madrox continued to work for S.H.I.E.L.D. instead of returning to Madrox Prime for reabsorption and was a strong supporter of the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. Agent Madrox eventually returned to [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations]] and convinced [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] and [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|M]] to sign up under the SHRA.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 8}}

He also freed and armed the [[Adrian Toomes (Earth-616)|Vulture]] to go after [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] once he stopped supporting the Registration Act. Vulture had a stroke during their fight and Madrox failed to apprehend Spider-Man when he visited him in the hospital.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Vol 1 14|16}}

Agent Madrox was among the team that raided a secret [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] base, but all they found were several dead Hydra agents and Madrox Prime. Before Agent Madrox knew what was happening, Madrox Prime was able to reabsorb him.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #15}}
