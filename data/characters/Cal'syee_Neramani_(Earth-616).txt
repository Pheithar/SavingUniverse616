| History                 = 
===Origin===
Born as Cal'syee Neramani, she was the eldest child of the Majestor Neramani and thus the heir of the [[Shi'ar Empire]]'s throne.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 10}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 156}}

Cal'syee was born with atavistic features and was fiercily proud of it.{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 14}} Unfortunately, the atavism also caused her to experience fits of uncontrollable rage that eventually forced Cal'syee to kill her mother and younger sister.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 10}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 156}} For these crimes she was stripped of her name and became known as Deathbird. She lost the right to the throne and was exiled from the [[Shi'ar Empire]].

===Earth===
Deathbird reached Earth trying to get some supplies for her ship, and she encountered superheroes [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms Marvel]] and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], and allied herself with [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]]. Later, she escaped from Earth.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 9|10}}{{r|Avengers Vol 1 189}}

===Empress===
Wanting the throne, she rebelled against D'Ken, who was emperor at the time, and allied herself with the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] to usurp him and, later, Lilandra (who succeeded D'Ken).{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 155|158}} She eventually usurped the throne and became empress of Shi'ar,{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 50}} although she had to face many rebellions. A group of [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] maimed her wings and forced her to abdicate in their favor.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 275|276}}

Deathbird sought the help of Lilandra's allies the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] but, once the Skrulls were removed from the throne, Deathbird chose not to sit on it, and she abdicated again in favor of Lilandra.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 277}} Due to her surprisingly good job while reigning, once the [[Kree-Shi'ar War]] was over, Lilandra named Deathbird viceroy of the recently annexed [[Kree Empire]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 347}}

===Horseman of War===
Deathbird was later recruited to serve Apocalypse as the Horseman '''War'''. She retrieved the [[Living Monolith]] along with X-Man [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] for [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] to use in the Twelve. Deathbird and [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Famine]] were teleported away by [[Mikhail Rasputin (Earth-616)|Mikhail Rasputin]] after Apocalypse's defeat.{{citation}}

While in space, she began a relationship with the time-displaced Bishop. The two ended up confronting each other over a plan to defeat the [[Ruul]], and Deathbird was presumed dead after being ejected from a spaceship.{{citation}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 483 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Deathbird and Vulcan]]
===Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire===
Deathbird was rescued by the Imperial Guard, but Lilandra imprisoned her because she posed a threat to her rule {{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 480}}.

On his quest for vengeance against the entire Shi'ar race, [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]] was captured and incarcerated in the same maximum security installation that housed Deathbird. Released by a member of a secret order that wished D'Ken to lead the Shi'ar once more, Vulcan himself released Deathbird.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 480|482}}

Vulcan was enthralled by Deathbird, and they became romantically involved. He promised to put his quest for vengeance on hold. Deathbird convinced Vulcan to finish the healing process that the Shi'ar members of the secret order had begun on D'Ken, who remained in a coma since the M'Kraan Crystal incident. When D'Ken discerned Vulcan's feelings for Deathbird, he invoked an ancient Shi'ar custom and invited Vulcan to marry Deathbird and become part of Shi'ar royalty.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 483}}

Vulcan and Deathbird were married in front of the M'Kraan Crystal just as the X-Men, Lilandra, The Starjammers, and the Shi'ar loyal to Lilandra attacked. During the chaos that ensued Vulcan killed D'Ken (as he didn't promise not to kill him) and assumed the throne of Emperor of the Shi'ar Empire, with Deathbird as his Empress. During the fight [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] crushed the ribs of Deathbird's husband and she instructed the Imperial Guard, still loyal to the ruling family, to protect them as they fled.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 485}}

Vulcan's rule was initially compared to Lilandra's as the Shi'ar thought Cal'syee's husband another weak human. Vulcan however proved that he was a strong emperor and the people fell in love with him. During the Starjammers escape from their prison planet Cal'syee was severely injured by Polaris.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 486}}

At some point after Vulcan's death she was captured by the [[Providian Order (Earth-616)|Providian Order]]. However they wasn't interested in Deathbird, but only in her [[Deathbird's Child (Earth-616)|child]] - hybrid of atavistic [[Shi'ar]] and powerful [[Homo superior|Mutant]]. [[Sharada Darthri (Earth-616)|Sharada Darthri]] experimented on the baby and infused it with [[Kree]] geneline.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 18|20}}

===Spider-Man and the X-Men===
Deathbird was later seen to still be pregnant and possessed by a group of rogue symbiotes who attacked S.W.O.R.D. and teleported to the X-Men headquarters. She was separated from the symbiote and later taken into custody.{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men Vol 1 5}}

===Dawn of X===
Due to the threat of the [[Titans (Eternals)|Titans]] impending war against the Shi'ar Empire, Majestor [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Kallark]] had Deathbird brought to serve as an adviser to [[Xandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Xandra]] and ready her to rule the Empire.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 2}}
