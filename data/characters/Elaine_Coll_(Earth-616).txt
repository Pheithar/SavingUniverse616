Scorpia recovered, and brought the surrendering Deathlok back to Silvermane. She was then ordered to ambush Spider-Man and [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], who had infiltrated their base. She was able to wear them down, but was then betrayed by Silvermane, who shot her in the back. Infuriated, Scorpia vowed revenge, and followed Spider-Man and Daredevil to his location. Once there, she immediately attacked, ending her dispute with the heroes and instead going right for her former employer. [[Ian Wajler (Earth-616)|Mainframe]], another of Silvermane's mercenaries, took control over Scorpia's cybernetic enhancements and used her to attack Spider-Man; however, she soon regained mobility and blasted Silvermane. An explosion created by the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] knocked Scorpia off the building they were on, but a mentally-conflicted Deathlok saved her. She then decided to flee the area, rather than be put in prison.{{r|Spider-Man: Power of Terror #3|4}}

Scorpia then joined the new [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Seven]] alongside The [[Jason Macendale Jr. (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]], [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]], [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]], the [[Adrian Toomes (Earth-616)|Vulture]], the [[Herman Schultz (Earth-616)|Shocker]], and the Beetle. Their main purpose was to stop [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]] from killing any more of Spider-Man's enemies.{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited Vol 1 9}}

After Hobgoblin was attacked by Kaine in Spider-Man's disguise, Scorpia immediately joined the others in the battle; however, they were not accustomed to working together, much to Scorpia's disdain. Spider-Man eventually entered the battle and was able to defeat Scorpia herself. She also participated in another battle against Spider-Man with some of her former allies, and new ones such as Boomerang and [[Steven Levins (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern]]. She was defeated when Spider-Man threw Jack O'Lantern at her.{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited Vol 1 12}}

More recently, Scorpia was seen attacking [[Carnegie Hall]] in search of a man named [[Garrison Klum (Earth-616)|Garrison Klum]], who she had planned to assassinate in a redesigned suit. She was able to fight her way through various [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|policemen]] and thugs, but was attacked by Spider-Man and [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]]. Scorpia held her own against the pair, but Black Cat was able to rip her tail off by jumping out of a hole in the wall while connected to it.{{r|Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do Vol 1 2}} She was later interrogated by Spider-Man at [[Midtown North Precinct]], where she revealed she was hired by [[Alberto Ortega (Earth-616)|Alberto Ortega]], the head of a local drug syndicate.{{r|Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do Vol 1 3}}

Scorpia was among several animal-themed super-villains captured by [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady (LMD) (Earth-616)|Black Ant]] to serve as hunting targets in [[Central Park]] for [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]], [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]], and a host of wealthy participants controlling robotic drones.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 19}} As the drones began killing several super-villains, Scorpia and several others agreed to appointing the Vulture as their leader.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 20.HU}} Alongside Vulture and his army of villains, Scorpia ambushed the drones.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 22}} After the forcefield holding the criminals inside of Central Park deactivated, Scorpia managed to escape.

When the [[Janice Lincoln (Earth-616)|Beetle]] founded an all-female criminal enterprise named the [[Syndicate (Beetle) (Earth-616)|Syndicate]], Scorpia was part of it.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 25}} Together, they went after [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]] for revenge.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 26}} After Beetle arranged behind her partners' back to hand him over to the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 27}} the entirety of the Syndicate felt compelled to help him evade arrest when he disclosed that he was trying to keep the pieces of the [[Lifeline Tablet]] out of Fisk's hands. The Syndicate were subsequently apprehended, but Beetle broke them out of police custody.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 28}} Not long afterward, Beetle was kidnapped by [[Giuletta Nefaria (Earth-616)|Madame Masque]] and [[Crime Master V (Earth-616)|Crime Master]] due to being the daughter of [[Lonnie Lincoln (Earth-616)|Tombstone]]. Tombstone enlisted the help of the Syndicate to rescue her and her boyfriend [[Randolph Robertson (Earth-616)|Randy Robertson]]. In the process, Scorpia and her teammates unwillingly teamed up with Spider-Man again, who was also helping foil Masque's and Crime Master's plans.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 65}}

Scorpia was next seen robbing a bank in [[Jersey City]], though she was quickly defeated by both [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] and [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 30}}

As part of his final attack against Spider-Man, the demonic [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Kindred]] abducted numerous villains that had been recently involved in the hero's life and implanted parasites in their brains to force them to do his bidding, including Scorpia. After capturing Spider-Man, Kindred let the villains loose on the hero, having promised that whoever killed the Web-Slinger was the only one to escape eternal damnation at his hands.{{r|Sinister War Vol 1 2}} The villains waged war against Spider-Man and each other until Doctor Octopus managed to broadcast an ultrasonic frequency that killed the parasites inside every villain's brain, neutralizing Kindred's only leverage on them, but also knocking all of them unconscious.{{r|Sinister War Vol 1 4}}
