| History                 = 
===Origins===
'''Angelo Unuscione''' was a superhuman [[Homo superior|mutant]] whose powers did not surface until adolescence. He first used them as a school bully, and later as a small time criminal.{{r|X-Men #8}} At some point after emigrating to America, Unuscione legally changed his name to '''Gunther Bain'''. He used his ability to create a virtually impenetrable force field around himself to launch a career as a flamboyant, invincible costumed wrestler known by the stage name of '''Unus the Untouchable'''.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 8}}

===Fighting the X-Men===
Unus was sought out by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] through his ally [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Mastermind]] as a potential addition to the original [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. As a test, Mastermind suggested Unus try to find the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], the team of mutants who were then Magneto's enemies, or to defeat one of them. Unus committed a theft and was himself found by the X-Men, who battled him.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 8}}

One of the X-Men, the [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], used his scientific skill to create a device that magnified the power of Unus's force field so much that Unus could not control it. Unable to stop projecting his force field, Unus found it impossible to hold food or eat. Unus gave himself up to the X-Men, and the Beast returned his power to its previous level. Unus, humbled, returned to his wrestling career.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 8}}

But months later, under the behind-the-scenes influence of the alien [[Lucifer (Quist) (Earth-616)|Lucifer]], Unus formed a friendship and criminal partnership with the [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]], another superhuman mutant.{{r|X-Men #20}} The two mutants eventually enlisted in two organizations of mutants bent on world conquest, the original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and [[Factor Three (Earth-616)|Factor Three]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 38|39}}

But then his power, for reasons still unknown, increased to such a high level that he could no longer shut it off and he could barely control it. Unus feared that he would die either of starvation from being unable to touch any food or from asphyxiation, since his power was beginning to repel air molecules. A blow of tremendous force from the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] apparently dispersed the field, but it immediately began to build again.{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 7}}

Since then, wearied and shaken by the failures of both groups, Unus abandoned his dreams of aiding in world conquest, and sought instead to amass a fortune for himself through crime.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist Vol 1 90}}

Eventually, his power once again ran beyond the limits that Unus could control. Unus found himself suspended by his field in the air, unable to eat. Finally, the force field became so strong that Unus was unable to breathe. He blacked out and the force field dispersed, causing him to fall into the arms of his friend, the Blob. The Blob believed Unus to be dead and went off on a grief-stricken rampage.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 91}}

===[[Genosha]]===
Unus later resurfaced in [[Genosha]]. No explanation was given for his apparent death and return.{{r|New X-Men #132}} Unus became a reoccurring threat to Magneto and Xavier after they moved into the wreckage of Genosha, albeit a minor threat.{{r|Excalibur Vol 3 #1|2}}

===[[M-Day]]===
[[File:Gunther Bain (Earth-616) from Son of M Vol 1 6 0001.png|thumb|right|Smothered by his force field]]
He was depowered after [[M-Day]], and was later proposed by [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] to use the [[Terrigen Mist]] to get his powers back. During a fight with the [[Inhumans]] over possession of the Terrigen Mists, [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]] struck his force-field, causing him to lose control of his powers. Unus suffocated and died, while Karnak felt sorry for this death.{{r|Son of M Vol 1 5|6}}

[[File:Gunther Bain (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 3 24 0001.png|thumb|250px|left|Unus among other [[Genosha]]ns]]
===[[Necrosha]]===
Unus was resurrected by the [[Techno-Organic Virus|Transmode Virus]] from [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]],{{r|X-Force Vol 3 21}} along with many other deceased mutants, and witnessed the arrival of [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] on [[Genosha]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 24}}

===Return===
Unus returned (alive and powered) and attacked the X-Men at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School]], at the same time [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] joined them. He was defeated by Spider-Man, who covered his force field in webbing, trapping him. Unus was then taken care of by [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]].{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men Vol 1 1}}

Unus joined the mutant-only nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|X-Men Vol 5 12}} Unus later joined the newly reformed X-Men in [[Otherworld]] defending Krakoa from the hoards of [[Amenth]].{{r|X of Swords: Destruction Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = '''Repulsion Field:''' Unus can generate an invisible psionic field around himself. This field can deflect and stop objects or projectiles. He can also use this field to move or push people or things. He can mentally control the field and make it as thick or as thin as he wished. He can even open a portion of the field to grab items or hit people. The limits of the field had not yet been determined, although it was shown to withstand direct hits from an enraged Hulk.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #14}}{{r|Marvel Fanfare #7}}

Unus inhaled the [[Terrigen Mist]] which brought his powers back and evolved them to an advanced degree. His powers were so enhanced that his shield, which was usually invisible, became visible. His shield, now a pinkish shiny color was able to withstand the devastating blows of [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]] and other weapons of mass destruction. However his powers became so advanced that his shield began to block out radio waves, sound waves, air, light waves, and other things.{{r|Son of M Vol 1 5|6}}

He has somehow gained his powers back.{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men Vol 1 1}}
