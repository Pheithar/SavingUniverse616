| History                 = 
===Early Life===
Baron Helmut Zemo, the 13th Baron Zemo and the son of [[Heinrich Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], the master [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi]] scientist and enemy of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] during [[World War II]]. Heinrich brought his son up to believe in the Nazi ideals of a master race, and that only the Zemo line should be ruling the world.{{r|Captain America: The Medusa Effect #1}}

[[File:Helmut Zemo (Earth-616) from Captain America Vol 1 168 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Helmut Zemo as Phoenix]]
===Phoenix===
Learning of his father's death, Helmut, now an engineer and strategist himself, blamed Captain America, and adopted the guise of the Phoenix in order to kill him in revenge. Zemo was defeated, however, falling in a vat of [[Adhesive X]], horribly disfiguring him.{{r|Captain America #168}}

===Zola's Monsters===
[[File:Helmut Zemo (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1 0001.jpg|thumb|right|The new Baron Zemo]]
He resurfaced years later as Baron Zemo, now working with [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]]'s monstrous creations. He allied with [[Primus (Android) (Earth-616)|Primus]], and kidnapped Steve Rogers childhood friend [[Arnold Roth (Earth-616)|Arnold Roth]] in order to lure him into a trap.{{r|Captain America #275}} He forced the Captain to fight hordes of mutates before revealing that he knew his secret identity.{{r|Captain America #276}}

===Mother Superior===
Zemo later encountered [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Sinthea Shmidt]] who was known as Mother Superior at the time and her father the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]].{{r|Captain America #289|290}} Zemo underwent training by Sin and the Red Skull, and then kidnapped Captain America's friend [[David Cox (Earth-616)|David Cox]] and brainwashed him to fight Cap.{{r|Captain America #293|294}} Zemo then kidnapped Arnold Roth again, and directed a shared mental re-enactment of Heinrich Zemo's last World War II encounter with Captain America.{{r|Captain America #295|297}} He turned against Mother Superior, but was overpowered by her psychic powers.{{r|Captain America #298|301}}

===Masters of Evil===
Helmut returned and continued to either try to take over the world or take revenge on Captain America, but was always defeated by his arch-enemy. One scheme in particular led him to recreate his father's team of super-villains known as the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]].{{r|Avengers #273|274}} Under his direction, the Masters of Evil succeeded in taking over the [[Avengers Mansion|mansion]] headquarters for Captain America's super-team, the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], in the Avengers' most serious defeat.{{r|Avengers #275|276}} Zemo was ultimately confronted by Captain America and was overpowered.{{r|Avengers #277|278}}

===Resurrecting His Father===
Zemo, with the help of [[Batroc's Brigade (Earth-616)|Batroc's Brigade]], tried to resurrect his father using the [[Bloodgem|Bloodstone]]. He raised his father only to learn that his father was nothing but disappointed in him.{{r|Captain America #357|362}}

===Baroness Zemo===
Helmut Zemo later married [[Heike Zemo (Earth-616)|Baroness Heike Zemo]], a woman who once claimed to be a reincarnation of Heinrich Zemo. The two lived together in the [[Castle Zemo]] ancestral home and organized the [[Kinder (Earth-616)|Kinder]].{{r|Captain America #431}} Named for the Nazi Wunderkinder (Wonder Kids, a.k.a. the Hitler Youth), the Kinder were a group of abducted children, who were originally captured as part of a white slavery ring by [[Damon Dran (Earth-616)|Damon Dran]].{{r|Captain America #432}} Zemo and the Baroness picked 25 children whom they deemed worthy and adopted them into their home in Castle Zemo.{{r|Captain America #433}} These children were essentially brainwashed into developing a fanatical devotion to the Nazi Party in general, and Zemo and the Baroness in particular. Captain America and his partner [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]] followed a lead on the missing children and defeated Zemo and the Baroness, freeing the children.{{r|Captain America #434}}

===Thunderbolts===
Zemo later put plans in motion to create a new Masters of Evil. During this time, however, Captain America and the Avengers were believed dead after seemingly sacrificing themselves to the psychic menace known as [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]]. Baron Zemo was briefly despondent, devoid of purpose with the loss of his greatest foes. Instead, Zemo hit upon the idea of leading the Masters in masquerading as a new heroic super-team to replace the Avengers, accumulating public trust and resources until they were ready to strike. Zemo himself adopted the alias of [[John Watkins (Earth-616)|Citizen V]], a 1940's adventurer slain by his father.{{r|Thunderbolts #-1}}{{r|Thunderbolts Annual Vol 1 1997}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #449|450}}

Under Zemo's direction, the team, called the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], was accepted as [[New York City|New York]]'s newest heroes far easier than they would have expected, and were soon given access to equipment used by heroes such as the Avengers and [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|Thunderbolts #1|3}} The team worked alongside Spider-Man{{r|Spider-Man Team-Up #7}} and battled various villains in New York.{{r|{{cl|Thunderbolts Vol 1 4}}-[[Thunderbolts Vol 1 8|8]]}}

Using this new-found trust and equipment, Zemo nearly succeeded in taking over the entire world, but the Thunderbolts, wanting to continue as heroes, mutinied and Zemo barely escaped, despite his use of the reborn Avengers as mind-controlled pawns. Zemo tried to affect his revenge on the Thunderbolts from his father's base in [[South America]], but was ultimately unsuccessful. He was then confronted by a new [[Dallas Riordan (Earth-616)|Citizen V]], claiming to be the true heir to the title, as Zemo never was. Zemo escaped capture, remaining at large for several months.{{r|Thunderbolts #17}}

Zemo was later targeted by the mysterious Scourge (in reality, [[Jack Monroe (Earth-616)|Nomad]] working on behalf of a government agent, [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Gyrich]], when both were mind-controlled), who stalked Zemo in his headquarters and beheaded him. However, Zemo survived due to a fail-safe device engineered by his robotic associate [[Norbert Ebersol (Robot) (Earth-616)|Techno]], a fail-safe which transferred Zemo's consciousness to a computer at the moment of his death. Techno, out of a perverse sense of humor, then transferred Zemo's consciousness into the comatose body of adventurer [[John Watkins III (Earth-616)|John Watkins III]], who had operated as the modern Citizen V with a covert group known as the [[V-Battalion (Earth-616)|V-Battalion]]. Once more hiding in plain sight as Citizen V, Zemo pretended to be the revived Watkins and assumed Watkins' former role as the leading agent of the V-Battalion, a role which brought him into contact with various members of the Avengers and the Thunderbolts again. For a time, Zemo, as Citizen V, was offered leadership over the [[Redeemers (Earth-616)|Redeemers]], a team of super-agents organized by the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities (Earth-616)|Commission for Superhuman Affairs]] (the same organization that was manipulated to make Scourge).{{r|Thunderbolts #48}}

Shortly afterward, the Redeemers were confronted by the Thunderbolt's archenemy, [[Franklin Hall (Earth-616)|Graviton]], who proceeded to slaughter the heroes before attempting to reshape the world in his own image. Zemo escaped and decided to reactivate his former Thunderbolt teammates, [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|MACH-3]] and [[Melissa Gold (Earth-616)|Songbird]], as the Thunderbolts were disbanded at the time. The remaining founding Thunderbolts, [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Meteorite]] and the [[Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|Fixer]], initially agreed to serve Graviton in order to be spared, but they soon switched allegiances. Through a mixture of surprise tactics and negotiation, the Thunderbolts managed to fight Graviton to a standstill and revealed that the aliens known as the [[P'Tah]] were using Graviton's energies to open a portal to the P'Tah's dimension. The Thunderbolts fought back the P'Tah invasion, but it took Graviton's dying effort to cause the portal to implode, sending himself through the portal and the P'Tah back with him. At the same time, the V-Battalion tried to teleport Zemo out of the area. The combination of energies interfered with Zemo's presence in Citizen-V's mind, and Zemo's presence was shunted to the mechanical systems of the Fixer.{{r|Thunderbolts #58}}

Graviton saved the Thunderbolts by using his powers to send them to the planet known as [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Counter-Earth]], a duplicate of Earth where Captain America and the Avengers were sent after seemingly sacrificing themselves. Although, Fixer knew he contained the disembodied consciousness of Zemo, Zemo purposely kept his presence a secret from the other Thunderbolts. Surreptitiously, Zemo and Fixer confronted Zemo's counterpart on Counter-Earth, the German hero [[Helmut Zemo (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Iron Cross]], and Fixer placed Zemo's mind within his counterpart. Zemo confronted his [[Heinrich Zemo (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|counterpart's father]] who had embarked on a global takeover scheme, and killed him, wishing to conquer the world in his own right.{{r|Thunderbolts #62}}

Zemo then invited the Thunderbolts to join him in conquering Counter-Earth. The rest of the team, however, wanted to save the troubled world rather than conquer it. Zemo began aiding them in their efforts, initially to win over converts to his cause of ruling civilization, but found himself coming to regard the business of world-saving as an intriguing avenue to achieve the same goals.{{r|Thunderbolts #64}}

The Thunderbolts went on to revive the flying city of [[Attilan]] and populate it with refugees and survivors of the war-torn and nearly-destroyed world. The Thunderbolts became renowned for their heroism and efforts to solve the world's problems. They were hailed by many to be the world's saviors, often leaving Zemo flushed with unexpected feelings.{{r|Thunderbolts #66}}

Eventually, the team encountered a spacecraft whose engines emitted a radiation that began eating Counter-Earth from the inside, and confronted a being born of that very radiation, [[Anomaly (Counter-Earth) (Earth-616)|Anomaly]]. The teen rebel soldiers called the [[Young Allies (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Young Allies]] arrived to show the Thunderbolts that the void created by the machine was linked to the primary Earth-616, and claimed only one planet could survive. Zemo was ready to use Anomaly to pull the real Earth into the void, destroying it. The rest of his Thunderbolts, however, embarked on a plan to combine their powers to punt the alien ship off the Earth and sever the link between the worlds. However, in order to complete this plan, the Thunderbolts needed to be inside the void in order to keep it clear of the real Earth as it closed. By so doing, they would reemerge from the void on the real Earth, forfeiting their roles and place on Counter-Earth.{{r|Thunderbolts #74}}

Immediately upon exiting the void, the Thunderbolts confronted their former teammates, [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and Songbird, who had formed another version of the Thunderbolts on Earth and were also trying to plug the real Earth's counterpart to Counter-Earth's spacecraft. The two teams of Thunderbolts combined forces to plug the void and shunt the alien ship from Earth.

After much discussion, Hawkeye agreed to leave the Thunderbolts to Zemo's leadership, reluctantly coming to agree that Zemo had proved he had potential to be a hero. Zemo congratulated his team, claiming to be embarking on a new mission, based on his experiences on Counter-Earth, to serve the best interests of the world at large, even though it would mean they would have to rule it in order to save it.{{r|Thunderbolts #75}}

[[File:Helmut Zemo (Earth-616) from Thunderbolts Vol 1 105 001.jpg|thumb|right|Helmut Zemo's face]]
Zemo led the Thunderbolts in many acts of questionable heroism, where the ends justified the means. In fact, Zemo's ultimate plan involved the creation of "[[Liberator|The Liberator]]", a device that would drain abnormal uses of energy throughout the world. He hoped this would reduce global threats, eliminate superhuman terrorism, and stabilize the world's status quo. The Thunderbolts succeeded in launching the Liberator, only to be challenged by the Avengers. Feeling betrayed, Moonstone absorbed the powers that The Liberator had harnessed, combining them with her already-increased powers. As she battled the Avengers, however, her emotional state combined with her near-cosmic power began to threaten the entire planet. The Thunderbolts and the Avengers teamed up to confront Moonstone. During the battle, Zemo blocked Moonstone's blast of energy from striking Captain America, which left him hideously scarred once more. Ultimately, the teams defeated Moonstone by removing the alien gems that gave her powers. Zemo grabbed the two moonstones, shouting to the Avengers that they had made a mistake in destroying his vision, and he teleported away.{{r|Avengers/Thunderbolts #6}}

===Born Better===
Zemo was sent back in time, traveling through the centuries and encountering key events of his forefathers of the Zemo lineage. In 1503, Zemo inspired the young [[Heller Zemo (Earth-616)|Heller Zemo]] to kill his corrupt father, [[Hademar Zemo (Earth-616)|Hademar]], and fulfill his role as the third Baron Zemo.{{r|Thunderbolts Presents Zemo Born Better Vol 1 1}} During the [[Seven Years' War]], Zemo saved the life of [[Elsbeth Kleinenshvitz (Earth-616)|Elsbeth Kleinenshvitz]], the Jewish fiancée of [[Hilliard Zemo (Earth-616)|Hilliard Zemo]], from an anti-Semitic execution.{{r|Thunderbolts Presents Zemo Born Better Vol 1 2}} 

In 1879, Zemo secretly became the traveling guard of [[Hobart Zemo (Earth-616)|Hobart Zemo]]; however, he failed to save Hobart's life during a civilian uprising. During [[World War I]], Zemo met his grandfather [[Herman Zemo (Earth-616)|Herman Zemo]] and witnessed him utilizing chemical warfare against British forces led by [[James Montgomery Falsworth (Earth-616)|Union Jack]].{{r|Thunderbolts Presents Zemo Born Better Vol 1 3}} 

Finally in his journey, Zemo came face to face with his father during his tenure as a Nazi. This resulted in a violent fight between father and son before the younger Zemo escaped back to his time. Upon arriving in the present, Zemo was greeted by his distant cousin [[Wendell Volker (Earth-616)|Wendell Volker]], who was responsible for bringing Zemo to his correct timeline by killing distant relatives of Helmut Zemo and intended on killing the baron himself. But Volker hesitated and could not go through with it. He then attempted to kill himself, but Zemo stopped him and chose to offer his tutelage to Volker.{{r|Thunderbolts Presents Zemo Born Better Vol 1 4}}

===Heroic Age===
Baron Zemo recruited the Iron-Handed [[Jurgen Hauptmann (Earth-616)|Jurgen Hauptmann]] of Red Skull's [[Exiles (Earth-616)|Exiles]], as well as a new female [[Janice Lincoln (Earth-616)|Beetle]] and Fixer to expose [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky]]'s sins to the world.{{r|Captain America #608}} Zemo was responsible for revealing to the public that Barnes had been the Winter Soldier.{{r|Captain America #609}} [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] had asked him to replace the, then, dead Rogers.{{r|Captain America #606|607}} Zemo stated that Barnes was simply given his role as Captain America and that he would have to prove his worth to wear the mantle.{{r|Captain America #610}}

===Fear Itself===
Baron Zemo and Sin traveled to [[Egypt]] to locate her father's hidden vault. They were trapped in the cave but able to escape. However, Sin then turned on Zemo, destroying his teleportation device and stealing his hovercraft to escape. Zemo commented that Sin played the game well but had made a new enemy.{{r|Fear Itself: Book of the Skull #1}}

===Hawkeye===
Zemo blamed Hawkeye for usurping control of the Thunderbolts. Zemo made a deal with [[Buck Chisholm (Earth-616)|Trick Shot (Buck Chisholm)]] who was suffering from cancer, to train [[Charles Barton (Earth-616)|Barney Barton]] to become a master archer in exchange for medical care.{{r|Hawkeye: Blind Spot #1}} When the training was complete, Zemo reneged on the deal. Trick Shot was delivered to [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] to serve as a message to Hawkeye. Before he died in his former pupil's arms, Trick Shot warned Hawkeye of the threat he would face.{{r|Hawkeye: Blind Spot #3|4}}

===Codename: Bravo===
Zemo made an alliance with [[Codename: Bravo (Richard) (Earth-616)|Codename: Bravo]] to kill Captain America.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 #1|17}} After Bravo failed, he allied with the [[Hydra Queen (Nowhere) (Earth-616)|Hydra Queen]] to found a new [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]].{{r|Captain America Vol 6 #18}}

===Hulk & Daredevil===
A rogue gun runner sold Zemo an experimental weapon.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #9}} While at his Hydra armory, [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] and [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] barged in. As Hulk and Daredevil fought the Hydra agents, Zemo fired a particle beam that blocked photons, blinding everyone, allowing him to escape. Evidently it had no effect on Daredevil, but the same could not be said for Hulk. Because Hulk was blinded he panicked, swinging at everything; friend or otherwise.{{r|Indestructible Hulk #10}}

===Avengers Undercover===
Zemo became the new leader of the [[Shadow Council (Earth-616)|Shadow Council]]'s Masters of Evil following the death of [[Max Fury (Earth-616)|Max Fury]].{{r|Avengers Undercover #1|10}}

===Leader of the New Hydra===
After the [[Terrigen Mist]] hit planet Earth, creating new [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] in the process, Baron Zemo, with the help of other super-villain affiliates of Hydra, started recruiting some of these new beings. One of them, a kid named [[Lucas (Inhuman) (Earth-616)|Lucas]], had a particular feature: his blood contained a toxin capable of sterilizing human beings. Believing he was going to create a pure and brand new world with Hydra ruling over it, Helmut recruited the kid. When the new Captain America [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Sam Wilson]] and his comrade [[Ian Rogers (Earth-616)|Nomad]] tried to neutralize [[Ecuador]]'s Hydra basement, Lucas was found by them attached to a machine that was draining his blood, believing him to be a victim of Hydra. Sam and Ian rescued him and then, running away from Hydra agents, they were teleported by an elevator to Zemo's main basement in [[Bagalia]]. There, Helmut and others super-agents of the New Hydra were waiting for them.{{r|All-New Captain America #1}}

[[File:Helmut Zemo (Earth-616) and Ian Rogers (Earth-616) from All-New Captain America Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|left|Killing Nomad.]]
The two heroes engaged in a fight against Zemo and the others, with Falcon getting out of the palace with Lucas and [[Brock Rumlow (Earth-616)|Crossbones]] following him, and Ian fighting against the others, easily being defeated. Then, Lucas revealed himself to be an agent of Hydra to Sam, shooting him in the shoulder and leaving him in the hands of Crossbones, only to return to watch his boss kill Ian Zola, cutting his throat. Zemo, knowing that Ian was Steve Rogers' adopted son, sent the photo of his corpse to the former Captain himself.{{r|All-New Captain America #2}}

Zemo appeared again after Sin apparently forced Sam Wilson to commit suicide, also recording his final moments before dying to defame him. The Baron told Sin to launch and detonate a bomb containing Lucas' blood in the atmosphere, with the Red Skull pushing the button to launch the bomb after shouting "Hail Hydra!" in front of him. Unbeknownst to him, Wilson, who was rescued by his pet [[Redwing (Earth-616)|Redwing]], came back and defeated Sin, destroying the bomb in the process.{{r|All-New Captain America #3}}

In Hydra's hidden base in [[Florida (State)|Florida]], with everything going according to his plan, Zemo celebrated his victory before actually having won. While the Hydra agents were distracted by Zemo's victory speech, Cap knocked out Crossbones and the pilot of the ship containing fleas infected with Lucas' blood. Zemo engaged in a fight with Sam to buy enough time to Lucas to enter and activate the ship and continue with the plan. Realizing what Zemo did, Sam tried to stop Lucas, but Zemo was able to take him down.{{r|All-New Captain America #4}}

[[File:Ian Rogers (Earth-616) vs. Helmut Zemo (Earth-616) from All-New Captain America Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|right|Hit by Nomad.]]
With his enemy lying on the floor, Zemo stabbed Cap with his sword. He tried to perforate Sam's lungs with it, but he fought back, hitting Zemo with his own sword's hilt. As Sam tried to use his telepathic link with birds to make them eat the released infected fleas, Zemo tried to stop him by hitting him, but it wasn't enough. Enraged by having his plan thwarted, Zemo prepared to decapitate Sam, but was hit by a surprisingly alive Nomad. Zemo fought back and contacted [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|his last Hydra operative]] standing, only to discover that the mercenary had been paid a whole lot more money than Zemo was going to pay him by [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] to not launch the bomb containing Lucas' blood. Then Zemo was knocked out by Cap.{{r|All-New Captain America #5}}

Sam left Ian to deal with [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc]] in his hidden Floridian base, while he would deal with Hydra's contingency plan in [[France]].{{r|All-New Captain America #5}} While the Leaper fought against Ian, an already recovered Zemo waited for [[John Falsworth (Earth-616)|Baron Blood]] to reach the atmosphere so he could activate his bomb, but Ian, already having defeated Batroc, attacked him, buying Sam enough time to reach Blood. Zemo hit Ian with his own [[Horde Crusher]] and then reached the button to detonate Blood, but, before he was able to push it, Ian threw his sword into his back, fatally wounding him. Bleeding, Zemo crawled away from his enemy as he said that sometimes doing the right thing means killing the necessary people, to which Zemo agreed. Then, the Hydra base they were in self-destructed, leaving his fate unknown.{{r|All-New Captain America #6}}

===Pleasant Hill===
Zemo survived, but was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. and imprisoned in their newest holding facility, a small town named [[Pleasant Hill]]. The inmates at Pleasant Hill had their memories and appearances changed with the use of a sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] named [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]], in the case of Baron Zemo, he was turned into a simple young man named Jim.

After taking some time to adapt to his new life at Pleasant Hill due to the lack of memories, "Jim" was approached by a fellow citizen who offered him to get answers. After showing "Jim" a video tape that revealed Pleasant Hill's true nature as a prison, this mysterious man revealed to "Jim" that he had subconsciously created a device that could revert them back to their true selves. The activation of the device returned Baron Zemo back to his normal self, and it revealed his ally to be the Fixer. Furious at the perversion of his identity, Zemo vowed to bring down Pleasant Hill around S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ears and bury them in it.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hill Vol 1 1}}

Using Fixer's device, Baron Zemo had several of his fellow inmates regain their memories, and the ability to shift between their false and true selves. After building a super-villain army in secrecy, Zemo launched a coordinated assault that spiraled Pleasant Hill into chaos, freeing the rest of the prisoners from Kobik's grasp.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Alpha Vol 1 1}} Baron Zemo proceeded to turn the town hall, which also served as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s main outpost, into a lock-up to hold numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel and citizens hostage, including S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] and [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]]. During this time, Rogers had stopped being Captain America after having the [[Super-Soldier Serum]] in his body neutralized.

Rogers eventually managed to escape from Zemo, and began looking for Kobik to have her restore peace.{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson Vol 1 7}} The villains also hunted her down, with the objective of bringing her to Zemo and strip her of her sentience using one of Fixer's devices. With Kobik reverted to a more primal state of a Cosmic Cube, Zemo would've reshaped reality, and turned S.H.I.E.L.D. and the rest of the world into his slaves in a similar way in which he was stripped of his identity at Pleasant Hill.{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson Vol 1 8}}

Kobik was captured by Zemo, but Steve Rogers, who had been returned to vigor by the omnipotent child, rallied the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and its [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Unity Division]] against him and his army of super-villains to save her. When Kobik was freed from the Fixer's device, she showed her resentment towards Zemo for the conflict at Pleasant Hill, and transported him far away to the [[Himalayas]]. With Zemo was also teleported [[Erik Selvig (Earth-616)|Erik Selvig]], Kobik's caretaker, for having used her to do whatever S.H.I.E.L.D. wanted.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Omega Vol 1 1}}

===Captain America, Agent of Hydra===
Unbeknownst to anyone, Kobik had been indoctrinated in secret by the Red Skull in the ways of Hydra while she was still in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, using her powers to exist both with him and her caretakers at the same time. Her innocently deranged set of values caused her to turn Steve Rogers into a Hydra agent when she restored his vitality.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 2}} In order to do so, she inserted false memories into his brain, memories of a past where he had been a Hydra double-agent since before becoming Captain America. One of the most important aspects of Steve's new memories was the presence of Helmut Zemo as his best friend when living at a Hydra academy at an early age.{{r|{{cl|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 7}}-[[Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 8|8]]}}

In the present, Rogers returned to the mantle of Captain America and tracked down Baron Zemo when the villain had traveled to [[Bagalia]] in an attempt to recreate the Masters of Evil. Zemo was forced to flee after being ambushed by Captain America and his allies, [[Jack Harrison (Earth-616)|Jack Flag]] and [[Cathy Webster (Earth-616)|Free Spirit]]. Captain America managed to intercept Zemo's getaway plane{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 1}} and faked both Selvig and Zemo's deaths.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 3}}{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 7}} Steve kept Zemo captive at his new secret base of operations, making Helmut his unwilling confidante. Over the course of the following months, Rogers managed to convince Zemo that the life he had lived without Steve by his side was the false one.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 11}}

===The Return of the Thunderbolts===
After the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] brought his war on crime to Zemo's domain of Bagalia, Zemo traveled to New York City after he got Castle labeled as an international terrorist. Punisher then came back to the states to settle the score with Zemo, but the Baron allied himself with [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Mayor Fisk]] who came up with a plan to deal with Castle once and for all. Joined by several of his former colleagues, Zemo adopted his old costume identity of Citizen V and revealed a new incarnation of the Thunderbolts during a press conference led by Fisk, where he said that he and his team will end the Punisher's reign of terror on New York and restore order to the city.{{r|Punisher Vol 12 13}} One of the members of the new Thunderbolts was the [[Ghost (Earth-616)|Ghost]], who apparently double-crossed Zemo and seemingly killed him on the Kingpin's behalf after Fisk decided to dispose of him.{{r|Punisher Vol 12 16}}<!-- If there is more context to Zemo's death please add it. -->

However, in reality, Ghost was working with Zemo and it was just part of his plan to convince Kingpin and the world of his demise. Shortly afterward, he was rematerialized and went into hiding while he tried to rebuild Hydra in secret. A mysterious person took advantage of Zemo's fake death and started to gain control over Hydra, eventually becoming Zemo's top competitor for the title of [[Supreme Hydra]]. 

Zemo's protege, [[Natural (Earth-616)|The Natural]] was set up as the new leader of Hydra while Zemo secretly controlled him. When The Natural was nearly exposed, he was sent to fight and stop Falcon and Winter Soldier from uncovering too much. After being beaten by Natural in their initial encounter, Falcon and Winter Soldier tracked Hydra to a train where they discovered Zemo was still alive and that he was controlling The Natural. They created a temporary alliance in order to stop Zemo's rival from taking over Hydra and causing chaos.{{r|Falcon & Winter Soldier Vol 1 2}}
