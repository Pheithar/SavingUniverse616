The monks also gave him a chemical solution that would allow him to disappear into a cloud of green mist, earning his first nickname the Green Mist. {{Citation}}

===Fear Itself===
During the [[Fear Itself]] event, the doors to the [[Eighth City]] were on the verge of being opened again forcing Fat Cobra and the Immortal Weapons to reunite once again in [[Beijing]]  with the addition of [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] who had accompanied [[Prince of Orphans]] from [[Washington, D.C.]] to close the gate.{{r|Iron Man 2.0 #5}} However, after being defeated by [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]] and [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]], when the Immortal Weapons started the ceremony, Iron Fist had come under the possession of [[Agamotto (Earth-616)|Agamotto]] which was creating a mystical interference that prevented the Immortal Weapons from closing the gate.{{r|Iron Man 2.0 #6}} After Iron Fist overpowered the other Immortal Weapons, a reluctant War Machine fought him and due to Doctor Strange infusing some magic to War Machine's gun, it allowed for Iron Fist to be knocked out, allowing for the ceremony to be completed.{{r|Iron Man 2.0 #7}}
