===Origins===
'''Grom''' was born an [[Eternals of Eyung|Eternal]]{{r|Fantastic Four #115}} of the planet [[Eyung]].{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #8}}

Eons ago, the Eternals learned to control aging and eliminate natural death, and were left endless life to wage endless war,{{r|Fantastic Four #115}} sanctioned by the government to prevent overpopulation.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #8}}

A fierce warrior, Grom claimed to have conquered a hundred world, won a thousand fights,{{r|Fantastic Four #115}} and massacred entire species.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #8}}

===The Games===
The Eternals later held gladiatorial spectacles called The Games,{{r|Fantastic Four #115}} enemies to conquer becoming rare.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #8}} Grom was tested and earned in combat the title of "'''Champion of Champions"'''.{{r|Fantastic Four #115}}

===War on [[Gigantus (Planet)|Gigantus]]===
Soon after Grom's coronation,{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #8}} the Eternals destroyed another inhabited planet, and became aware of its neighboring [[Gigantus (Planet)|Gigantus]], the pacific and life-lovers [[Gigantians]] who had remained hidden in fear, and sought to invade it.{{r|Fantastic Four #115}}

Immediately they launched an attack upon the world. Because Gigantus was a massive world (several hundred times bigger){{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #8}} with an as well massive population, the war became very costly and difficult for the Eternals to sustain, with the [[Gigantians]] growing adepts to warfare.{{r|Fantastic Four #115}}

Finally it was decided to simply obliterate the planet. The Eternals showered Gigantus with immensely powerful [[Reaction Bombs]] (nuclear warheads),{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #8}} causing a chain reaction eventually resulting in the destruction of the planet.{{r|Fantastic Four #115}}

A huge armada of Gigantians escaped the world's destruction and attacked Eyung in retaliation, using similar bombs. Underestimating the Gigantians' attack and unprepared, the Eternals defenses fell.{{r|Fantastic Four #115}}

===Over-Mind===
The Eyungian Lord realized that their race faced total extinction. He summoned the Scientists Royal to use the Final Project, a discovery useless until then: As the surviving population of Eyung marched into huge "synthesizing chambers" scattered across the planet, their brain-power was harnessed and transferred into the Champion Grom, for his to become the '''Over-Mind''', and avenge his people by crushing the universe.{{r|Fantastic Four #115}}

When the process was complete, and only the Lord and the scientists who conducted the process were left alive, the capsule containing Grom was launched into space to incubate{{r|Fantastic Four #115}} his people's collective consciousness until the being assimilated. Protective spore around the capsule hid him until his awakening.{{r|Fantastic Four #115}} 

Eons later, Grom emerged as the Over-Mind, possessing the collective psionic power of a billion brains and carrying in his memory the command to subdue the universe. He transformed the spore into a spacecraft{{r|Fantastic Four #115}} and fled to the nearest inhabitable planet: [[Earth]].{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #8}}

The Gigantians created a [[Gigantian Uni-Mind (Earth-616)|being similar to the Over-Mind]], in order to destroy as soon as he would awoke.{{r|Fantastic Four #115}} This being was accidentally killed by the [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]] who vowed to fulfill his role.{{r|Quasar #16}}

===Earth===
The Over-Mind came to [[New York (State)|New York]] and took control of [[New York City]] [[John Lindsay (Earth-616)|Mayor John Lindsay]], making him arrest the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]],{{r|Fantastic Four #113}} seeing them as his most likely opponents,{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #8}} intending them to take control of the President and all his generals, then every ruler on Earth.{{r|Fantastic Four #113}} Crossing them in the streets, he opposed them to test their powers. Once he had evaluated they didn't represented any danger, he erased the encounter from their memories, and departed.{{r|Fantastic Four #114}}

Finally learning about the Over-Mind and his origins by [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu the Watcher]], [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] departed from the FF to fight the Over-Mind,{{r|Fantastic Four #115}} was captured by him and subjected to his mental control. In parallel, the New Yorkers tainted by the Over-Mind's growing power were sacking their own city.{{r|Fantastic Four #116}}

The [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], assisted by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], battled him but were unable to defeat the Over-Mind, until the arrival of the [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]], posing as the embodiment of the collective psionic power of all the surviving Gigantians (''"a billion billion brains-- and more!"''). The Stranger's psionic abilities proved to be more powerful than those of the Over-Mind and he shrunk the Over-Mind to microscopic stature and exiled him to ''"a dead and lifeless universe within mote of dust"'',{{r|Fantastic Four #116}} into a [[Microverse]].{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11|; [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]]'s entry}}

===[[Microverse]]===
There, the Over-Mind was driven mad by loneliness until the demonic creature called [[Null the Living Darkness (Earth-616)|Null the Living Darkness]] located him and decided to use him as a pawn in his scheme of conquest. However, when he restored the Eternals to his original power and stature, Null accidentally transported the Over-Mind to an [[Earth-712|alternative Earth]] other than the one upon which he had met his defeat. He decided to settle his plan on this reality however{{r|Defenders #114}}

===[[Earth-712]] & the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Squadron Supreme]]===
[[File:Defenders Vol 1 113 001.jpg|thumb|180px|left]]
The Over-Mind presented to [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-712)|President Kyle Richmond]] as the sole survivor of his races and was welcomed in open arms.{{r|Defenders #112}} Null seemingly slew Richmond, who was in fact was transported by the [[Chorus (Earth-616)|Chorus]] (a merged consciousness of telepaths) to [[Earth-616]]{{r|Defenders #113}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #8}} and replaced by a bio-construct.{{r|Defenders #115}}

Soon afterwards, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-712)|F.B.I.]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-712)|C.I.A.]] starting arresting countless people.{{r|Defenders #112}}

Trying to confront "Richmond" and the Over-Mind, the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Squadron Supreme]] summoned them at their orbiting "[[Rocket Central]]" headquarters. There, "Richmond" revealed the truth about the Over-Mind's origins and doings. Over-Mind then defeated the whole Squadron, and "absorbed" it to conquer the world, safe for [[Mark Milton (Earth-712)|Hyperion]] who was able to escape and ask reinforcements in the persons of the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]],{{r|Defenders #112}} sent by Chorus.{{r|Defenders #113}}

Within six months, the entire planet was under the Over-Mind, who then started the building a fleet of nuclear missiles and{{r|Squadron Supreme #1}} spacecrafts on the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]]{{r|Defenders #112}} in order to fulfill the prophecy.{{r|Defenders #113}}

The Defenders, along with the Chorus, attacked the Squadron on the Moon, easily dispatching them. As [[August Masters (Earth-616)|August Masters]] killed "Richmond", the Over-Mind stopped the fight, seemingly lost, while Null revealed himself.{{r|Defenders #113}} While draining the Over-Mind, Null was opposed by the Chorus uniting the spirits of the Defenders.{{r|Defenders #114}}

At the battle's end, the Over-Mind's Eternal consciousness was suppressed and the six telepaths, lacking physical bodies, took refuge inside him.{{r|Defenders #114}}

===Defenders===
Now possessing a benevolent mind and a small fraction of his former mental might, the Over-Mind controlled by the Chorus returned with the Defenders to their world, joining their ranks for some months,{{r|Defenders #115}} assisting [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] in his thoughts,{{r|Defenders #116}} attending [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]]'s funeral in the form of [[Mindy Williams (Earth-616)|Mindy Williams]].{{r|Defenders #117}}

Consecutively to this funeral, the Chorus decided to give peace to each of its members. As [[Phillip le Guin (Earth-616)|Phillip le Guin]], he was rejected by his family and friends. As [[Ursula Richards (Earth-616)|Ursula Richards]], she burst against her life and the ghetto she was originated, starting to tear it apart until she nearly killed some of its inhabitants inadvertently. All of them had eventually their pasts laid to rest, and learned that they could be of great help for the future, if they were to remain surrounded by love and friendship, from the Defenders who officially accepted Over-Mind among them.{{r|Defenders #117}}

He helped locate [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]]{{r|Defenders #120}} and tried battling the [[Joshua Ayers (Earth-616)|Miracle Man]] but was taken down easily. Exhausted, he linked his mind to [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]] and together were able to counter the Miracle Man.{{r|Defenders #121}}

He later tried to convince [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] to remain on the team.{{r|Defenders #122}} Growing himself uncomfortable in the team,{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #8}} he left{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #8}} after having blanked out their memories of his presence among them.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 9}} 

===Solo adventures===
He eventually spent some time trying to help the people of [[Millwood]], [[New Hampshire (State)|New Hampshire]], a little town full where its citizens were suffering from radiation{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #9}} and chemical poisoning by granting them an illusion of health and motivating them to keep a positive attitude, teaching them that they could do anything if they tried. Over-Mind's illusion had a positive effect on the healing abilities of Millwood 800 inhabitants.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #40}}

When hazmat-suited government operatives entered the town, they were explained the situation and offered Over-Mind to treat them. Over-Mind initially refused, given the slim chance for them to cure, and intended to return the scientists without memories of their encounter. He was changed his mind by a child who recall him of his own advice. Freeing the town from his illusion, Over-Mind left, witnessing the medics and ambulances rushing in the city to save as much people as possible. While the medics were optimistic,{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #40}} Over-Mind was deeply troubled by his failure,{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #8}} and eventually became a vagrant in [[New York City]].{{r|Quasar #13}}

===Resurfacing and facing the Stranger===
Years later, the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Squadron Supreme]] returning to [[Earth-616]], the consciousness of the Over-Mind perceived it and though to consume the psyches of the six telepaths in the process.{{r|Quasar #13}}{{r|Quasar #16}} The Chorus was simply engulfed by the billion Eternal brains,{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #9}} absorbed among them.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #8}}

He found back his spacecraft and took control of the Squadron Supreme. Using [[Raleigh Lund (Earth-712)|Shape]] and [[Harold Danforth (Earth-712)|Haywire]] to battle [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]] and cover his departure, he left Earth with most of the Squadron aboard.{{r|Quasar #13}}

Bringing them to the Stranger's [[LabWorld|Laboratory World]],{{r|Quasar #14}} he turned the Stranger's captives in his own army, while [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]], [[Mark Milton (Earth-712)|Hyperion]] and [[Makkari (Earth-616)|Makkari]] attempted to find back the Squadron. Using the Squadron as a leverage, threatening to kill them, he forced Quasar to bring the Stranger to him, setting a trap on his return.{{r|Quasar #15}}

While Hyperion, Quasar and Whizzer were overwhelmed by the Over-Mind's army, himself faced the Stranger, until this one revealed that he wasn't the Gigantian uni-mind but had encountered it and carried his legacy. [[Watchers]] seeking to discuss with the Stranger started to assemble over the battle, triggering the Over-Mind's paranoia, allowing his opponent to defeat him,{{r|Quasar #16}} as his powers turned inwards and drove him into coma.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #8}} The Stranger incarcerated him as an experiment subject.{{r|Quasar #16}}

He eventually escaped and returned to Earth, where he kept a low profile.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #8}} Invited to a reunion of Fantastic Four enemies where the [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]] tried to band them together but rejected the proposal as all invited villains did. Unaware to him, his DNA had been gathered (like the rest of them), allowing Puppet Master to control him.{{r|Fantastic Four: Foes #1}}

For a time, the Over-Mind  was under the mental domination of the [[Zebediah Killgrave (Earth-616)|Purple Man]], who used him to monitor the population of New York. More recently, he was briefly forced to work with [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]].

The Over-Mind of Earth-712 resided for centuries, aware of his counterpart's attempt to take over his universe, until he one day befriended the Squadron's arch-enemy the [[Nathaniel Richards (Scarlet Centurion) (Earth-6311)|Scarlet Centurion]]. When he was brought back to the 20th century to combat the [[Thomas Lightner (Earth-616)|Nth Man]], he ultimately perished from the mental backlash caused by his attack on the cosmic threat.{{r|Squadron Supreme Death of a Universe #1}}
