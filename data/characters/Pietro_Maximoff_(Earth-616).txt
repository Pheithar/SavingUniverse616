===Early Life===
Pietro Maximoff was kidnapped from [[Serbia]] and brought to [[Wundagore Mountain]], base of the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]]. For years, he and his twin sister, [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Wanda]], believed they were the were the children of [[Romany (Earth-616)|Romany]] couple, [[Django Maximoff (Earth-616)|Django]] and [[Marya Maximoff (Earth-616)|Marya Maximoff]], later revealed to be the twins' maternal uncle and aunt.{{r|Scarlet Witch Vol 2 11}} The High Evolutionary supposedly abducted the twins when they were babies and experimented on them, once he was disgusted with the results, he returned them to the Maximoffs' custody, disguised as regular [[Homo superior|mutants]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 2 4}}

As adolescents, Wanda and Pietro discovered that they had unusual superhuman abilities. When Django began to steal food to feed his starving family, enraged villagers attacked the Romani camp. Using his phenomenal speed, Pietro fled from the camp with his sister. The circumstances of their separation from their family were so traumatic that not until well into adulthood could they remember anything but the barest details of their childhood. For the next few years Wanda and Pietro wandered central Europe, living off the land.{{r|Avengers #182}}

===Brotherhood of Evil Mutants===
One day, Wanda accidentally caused a house to burst into flame through her hex powers, which she could not yet control. Superstitious townspeople began chasing her, thinking she was a witch. Despite Pietro's attempt to defend her, they were soon overpowered and were about to become victims of mob violence when Magneto came to their rescue.{{r|X-Men #4}} Magneto pressed them into service in his [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], costumed them, and named them the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. For months they served Magneto out of a sense of obligation and fear of his reprisal. As members of the Brotherhood, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch aided Magneto in his terrorist campaigns against humanity and helped him combat the original members of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|X-Men #4|7}}{{r|Journey into Mystery #109}}

Quicksilver found it was relatively easy for him to defeat [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], by simply evading Cyclops' blasts and waiting for Cyclops' energy reserves to be exhausted. However, Quicksilver had no way to counter [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]]'s telekinesis. She easily lifted him on the air, spinning him around until he was too dizzy to defend himself.{{r|X-Men #6}}

When Magneto was defeated by the overwhelming powers of the alien [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]], Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch quit the Brotherhood; the Stranger transported Magneto away from Earth, and the Maximoff twins returned to Transia.{{r|X-Men #11}}

===Joining the Avengers===
Pietro and Wanda sought refuge with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], a world-renowned team of super heroes. They were inducted along with [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] to take the place of the charter members, who wished to take a leave of absence.{{r|Avengers #16}} This foursome was nicknamed "Cap's Kooky Quartet". At first it was looked upon as less capable than the previous roster, but defeating [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]],{{r|Avengers #23|24}} [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], and other threats quickly proved their worth. Although the hot-tempered Quicksilver and Hawkeye often both rebelled against his orders, Avengers leader [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] molded them into valuable team members.{{r|Avengers #16|30}}

Humanity's suspicion of mutants still rankled Quicksilver, and he briefly rejoined Magneto after the latter returned to Earth, compelling his sister to come with him. The X-Men and Avengers eventually defeated Magneto.{{r|Avengers #49|53}}

The Scarlet Witch then began a quest to recover her powers by studying grimoires, with Quicksilver and the Toad supporting her. Her studies accidentally summoned extra-dimensional caudillo [[Arkon (Earth-616)|Arkon]], who kidnapped the Witch to made her his bride, the Toad when he opposed, and then a number of Earth-born scientists in an attempt to use atomic power to save his own world [[Polemachus]] even by destroying Earth. Quicksilver gained the help of the Avengers to save his sister,{{r|Avengers #75}} the Avengers managed to save Polemachus without damaging Earth, Arkon ceased any further violence against Earth and renounced to the Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch eventually resumed their membership with the Avengers.{{r|Avengers #76}} The Toad chose to remain at Polemachus.

===Marriage===
Seriously injured during the Avengers' battle against the [[Sentinels]],{{r|Avengers #104}} Quicksilver was taken to medical care by [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]], a member of the royal family of the hidden race of [[Inhumans (Race)|Inhumans]]. Months passed before Quicksilver was well enough to contact his companions to tell them what had happened to him.{{r|Avengers #110}} During that time Quicksilver became romantically involved with Crystal, and the two married after a brief courtship. The Inhumans, the Avengers, and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] attended the wedding, held in the Inhumans' refuge of [[Attilan]], then located in the Himalayan Mountains.{{r|Fantastic Four #150}}

Not long after the birth of his and Crystal's first child, [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna]], Quicksilver learned the alleged truth about his parentage. Magneto had stumbled upon Bova and learned from her that Wanda and Pietro were supposedly his children.

Confronting Quicksilver and his sister in Attilan with this revelation, Magneto apparently hoped to sway his children to rejoin his crusade against humanity. But Quicksilver denounced Magneto for his callous treatment of them when they were members of his Brotherhood, and refused to believe he had changed his ways.

A man of action, Quicksilver volunteered his services to the head of the Inhumans' small militia and became an officer. During the period of his service, however, the Inhumans had no call for military activity.

Quicksilver's neglect of his wife led Crystal to become involved with another man. Learning of her infidelity, Quicksilver refused to forgive her and fled Attilan, vowing vengeance on her and all those he perceived as having wronged him. Unknown to anyone, however, Crystal's malevolent cousin [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]] was manipulating Quicksilver's mind, fanning Quicksilver's anger at Crystal into a rage directed against his former colleagues in the Avengers. Quicksilver framed the Avengers for treason, thereby turning the federal government against them until they cleared their names. Quicksilver also led the members of the android version of the criminal organization [[Zodiac Cartel (Earth-616)|Zodiac]] against the Avengers, fought the Fantastic Four, and joined forces with various Soviet-era Communist operatives against the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|Avengers' West Coast]] division.

Eventually Maximus' control over Quicksilver's mind lapsed and Pietro ended his criminal ways. The Inhumans' monarch [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] commanded that the reluctant Quicksilver reconcile with Crystal. Their initial attempts failed. Quicksilver unofficially joined the Avengers' West Coast branch for a time. Eventually Crystal took Luna to Earth and joined the Avengers, and Quicksilver shortly afterwards became a special operative of the United States government as part of its new, [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]]-led version of [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]].

Quicksilver and Crystal again attempted a reconciliation, but Crystal was romantically involved with the Black Knight. They reconciled after the Black Knight left [[Earth-616]], seemingly permanently. Quicksilver left X-Factor and again became affiliated with his wife's team, the Avengers. However, their happiness was short-lived, because Crystal seemingly perished in the Avengers' battle against [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]]. In actuality she, along with many other members of the Avengers, had been transported to an [[Heroes Reborn (1996 Event)|alternate reality]]. During her absence, the High Evolutionary asked Quicksilver to become the leader of a small band of his [[Knights of Wundagore (Earth-616)|Knights of Wundagore]], animals that the geneticist had endowed with human intelligence and humanoid forms. Quicksilver accepted and for a time led the Knights in battles against injustice. Quicksilver and Crystal were happily reunited after she and the other missing Avengers finally returned to their native Earth. They split, however, when she could not choose between Quicksilver and a returned Black Knight.

===House of M===
When his sister lost her sanity and her control over her ever increasing power, she killed several Avengers, leading to their disbandment.{{r|Avengers Disassembled}} She was taken into the custody of [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], who asked [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] to try and help her.{{r|Excalibur Vol 3 10|14}} Xavier's treatments weren't successful however, and as Wanda's condition worsened, the Avengers and X-Men met to discuss what to do with her. Quicksilver found out about the meeting and that they were discussing euthanizing Wanda. He told his father, but Magneto, at the end of his rope, believed that they might be right to do so.{{r|House of M #1}}

In order to save his sister, Quicksilver convinced her to use her powers in tandem with Xavier's telepathy to warp reality and create a new world, where they would all have what they wanted.{{r|House of M #7}} Wanda did so, and created a [[Earth-58163|world ruled by Magneto]] where mutants were a thriving majority and Pietro and Wanda were royalty. However, this new reality began to crumble when several heroes began to remember the old world due to the powers of [[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|Layla Miller]].{{r|House of M #4}} Believing Magneto to be responsible, they attacked him and his family in Genosha. There, Layla Miller restored his memory as well, and the heroes realized that Quicksilver had been the one to manipulate Wanda into warping reality. Angry over what his son had done in his name, Magneto lashed out and killed Pietro. This finally drove Wanda over the edge. Angry that their father had always put mutantkind before his children, Wanda restored reality again, only now with most of the former mutants depowered - including Quicksilver.{{r|House of M #7|8}}

===Decimation and the Terrigen Crystals===
As a result of losing his powers, his sister, and his reputation, Quicksilver fell into a deep depression.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 177}}{{r|Son of M #1}} When a mourning [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] confronted Quicksilver for his role in creating the House of M reality, Quicksilver jumped off a roof in an attempt to commit suicide, seriously injuring himself and possibly breaking his spine. He was saved, though, by his ex-wife [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]] who teleported him to an [[Kalikya (Earth-616)|Inhuman healer]].{{r|{{cl|Son of M Vol 1 1}}-[[Son of M Vol 1 2|2]]}}

[[File:Son of M Vol 1 2 Textless.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Quicksilver exposed to the mist]]
Believing he had become suicidal only upon the loss of his powers, the Inhumans took Quicksilver in on their refuge on the moon. Deciding that he could not stand life as a human, Pietro asked [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] for permission to undergo [[Terrigenesis]] to restore his mutant abilities, but was denied for not being an Inhuman.{{r|Son of M #2}}

Quicksilver reunited with his daughter [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna]] he hadn't seen for several years. She introduced him to a [[Videmus (Earth-616)|"communicator"]] from whom he learned much about the process of [[Terrigenesis]], which led him to violently break into the sacred Terrigen Cavern, hereby knowingly desecrating the "holiest, most sacred place imaginable" for the Inhumans, and exposing himself directly to the well of the [[Terrigen Mist]], regardless of the high genetic risks.{{r|Son of M #2}} He developed the ability to time-travel, which would in turn gravely deteriorate his health. Nonetheless, driven by the responsibility to restore the mutant population he had led his [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|sister]] into decimating, he began working with older selves of himself to steal the [[Terrigen Crystals]]. He even manipulated his daughter [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna]], craving to be with her father, into collaborating with him. He also briefly tried to win his [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|wife]] back, but she repelled him as she couldn't trust him, as well as for his childish jealousy. Eventually, he managed to steal the [[Terrigen Crystals]] from the future, in the process killing his assigned [[Goran Maledicta (Earth-616)|guard]], and used [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna]] to have [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]] aid their escape.{{r|Son of M #3}}

Quicksilver then exposed [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna]] to the [[Terrigen Mist]] against her will.{{r|Son of M #3}} Being given the ability to "see" and manipulate "souls" and emotions, she saw a dark core spreading inside him.{{r|Son of M #4}}

He then traveled to [[Genosha]] to restore the powers of the [[Excalibur (Genoshan) (Earth-616)|resident depowered mutants]]. By making them believe he had restored his own former powers, he tricked them into exposing themselves to the [[Terrigen Mist]]. This promptly restored their powers but let them go out of control at the same time, putting [[Callisto (Earth-616)|Callisto]] into a coma and later killing [[Gunther Bain (Earth-616)|Unus]]. It was later revealed though that the powers had only been temporary.{{r|Son of M #3|6}} When [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] found [[Callisto (Earth-616)|Callisto]], he assaulted and offended his son, which made Quicksilver beat him down for never acknowledging him, only stopped by his crying daughter.{{r|Son of M #5}}

When the Inhumans and the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O.N.E.]] both moved in to acquire the [[Terrigen Crystals]], [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna]] had [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]] teleport them to safety, leaving the crystals behind with the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O.N.E.]]. When the president decided not to give the crystals back to the Inhumans, this ultimately ignited the [[Silent War Vol 1|Silent War]] between the Inhumans and the U.S. Finally understanding that [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna]] had become addicted to the [[Terrigen Mist]], Quicksilver sent her back to her [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|mother]], leaving her with the feeling of being rejected by her father, again.{{r|Son of M #6}}

After his repeated exposure to the Mists he had also gained the power to confer [[Terrigenesis]] with his hands,{{r|Silent War #3}} restoring the super-human abilities of former mutants, although still with uncertain outcomes.{{r|Son of M #6}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 8}} He later learned that when he touched mutants who still had their powers, he could overload them and thus take them out for a while.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 11}} As he walked away, Quicksilver appeared more mentally unstable than ever before as he chose to embrace the destruction that lay ahead. When he used his power to "cure" a man on the street, he turned out to be the villain known as [[Pantu Hurageb (Earth-616)|Reaper]].{{r|Son of M #6}}

===Silent War===
Alone by himself again, Quicksilver bathed himself in the Terrigen Mists for at least seven days, going so far as to absorb the crystals into his own body. He used the [[Terrigen Crystals]] to travel months into the future, farther than ever before, where he remained for several days. He read of the war between Inhumans and the U.S. he had ignited and then saw an explosion on the moon that was so big one could see it with the naked eye.{{r|Son of M #6}}{{r|Silent War #2|3}} It was later revealed to have indeed been the destruction of Attilan, leading to [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]]'s evil brother [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]] taking over the rule over the Inhumans.{{r|Silent War #6}}

When the Inhumans came for him, [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna]] and [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]] realized that he had gone mad. He again approached [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]] they could be a family again, but she told him that she had their marriage annulled after he had taken [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna]] from her. He took a beating from [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] to have it out of the way, which [[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|Layla]] convinced him of, being - according to her - part of her plan to bring him "all the way to the bottom" so he could then be redeemed. He also told the Inhumans about his forecast regarding Attilan.{{r|Silent War #3}}

===X-Factor===
Quicksilver opened up a "clinic" in Mutant Town, now believing to be a Savior; that "something greater" had given him his "gift" to administer the divine test for mutant kind that was the [[Decimation]], restoring only those former mutants who were "deserving" - causing even more accidents and deaths.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 10}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 13}} He also came across Layla Miller, who tried to get him killed, and deemed her "evil", for getting in his way.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 8}} Regarding the upcoming [[Civil War|superhuman civil war]], he approached his former teammates in the new [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] to join forces against the oppressive regime. Self-righteously stating he had done the right thing all along, he was rejected, but still luckily protected from the X-Men when [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] denied them jurisdiction in [[Mutant Town]] for being left in the dark about the [[Decimation]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 9}}

After being approached by a member of the [[X-Cell (Earth-616)|X-Cell]], a group believing the U.S. government to be behind the [[Decimation]], Quicksilver offered to aid the group to use them to his advantage.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 18}} With their help, he kidnapped [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] and lured him into working as a siphon for his power through which he attempted to restore mutantkind.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 19}} But Layla Miller disturbed him again, showing the [[X-Cell (Earth-616)|X-Cell]] that Quicksilver had known about the [[Decimation]] and also that their "restored" members had become self-destructive. As he stabbed [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]] to get away and threatened to silence Layla, Rictor used his temporarily restored powers to pull the crystals out of Pietro and stop him from harming anyone else.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 20}} Pietro continued his descent into madness, losing control over his body, showing trembling hands. He kidnapped Layla Miller into the inside of a merry-go-round, attempting to kill her in God's name for being a vessel of the devil, but failed, not really being convinced of it.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 23}} Beaten down, he was arrested; probably for vagrancy.{{r|X-Factor: The Quick and the Dead #1}}

===Rehabilitation (Mighty Avengers)===
While in jail, Quicksilver experienced a series of hallucinations, of his [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|sister]], his [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|ex-wife]] and [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|daughter]], and his [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|father]]. Through those hallucinations, he realized that he had been spiraling because he had been "drowning under the weight of expectations". But now he had hit rock bottom and nothing more to lose. He also realized that he didn't need the [[Terrigen Crystals]] anymore since they had "done their job". Seeing a murder-to-be through the window, he snapped out of his hallucinations and found his powers re-manifested. Escaping jail, Quicksilver rescued an innocent, rediscovered his desire to be a hero and felt forgiven by God.{{r|X-Factor: The Quick and the Dead #1}}

After these events, Pietro obtained a new (green) costume and rejoined the [[Knights of Wundagore (Earth-616)|Knights of Wundagore]] in search of redemption, being the last of his families he hadn't let down. He served as a scout and gathered intelligence for them but was later captured by [[Modred (Earth-616)|Modred]], who had killed them all. The sorcerer transferred Quicksilver's consciousness into [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]]'s spell book, the [[Darkhold]], while transferring Chthon's consciousness into his body, using it to bring about the end of the world.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 21|22}} Hank Pym and his new Mighty Avengers eventually thwarted Chthon and Pietro was returned to his body. When [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]] (now the Wasp) offered the present heroes to join his Avengers, Quicksilver declined, showing he never left his arrogant ways, not wanting to risk the rebuilding of his reputation being associated with people of their "caliber". Also, he wanted to study the [[Darkhold]] and its chaos magic, hoping to find out more about his sister's current whereabouts and, perhaps, reasons for her breakdown.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 23}}

[[File:Mighty Avengers Vol 1 24 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Quicksilver and Loki, disguised as the Scarlet Witch]]
When he found out that his sister was on the team, unbeknownst to him and most of the [[Mighty Avengers (Pym) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]] in reality being a disguised [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]], Pietro chased after them and, after continuous efforts, was finally accepted. During an interview, he stated on TV that his villainous actions had actually been performed by a Skrull impostor. [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Jarvis]] and [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Pym]], having been replaced themselves, knew that was a lie, but went along with it to allow him a second chance and in the hope of solving the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch's]] sudden return.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 24}} Pietro participated in all of the - in his view pathetic - team's missions only hoping to speak with his sibling but met with no success.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 25|33}}

The Mighty Avengers defeated the [[Unspoken (Earth-616)|Unspoken]], once king of the Inhumans, who wanted to use the [[Xerogen Crystals]] against humanity because of the [[Silent War Vol 1|Silent War]] Quicksilver had caused. Pietro returned the crystals to [[Attilan]], thus clearing his name and being welcomed back into the royal family by repeating the lie, his crimes had been done by a Skrull impostor. But Pietro's daughter [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna's]] power allowed her to see through the lie. While she kept the truth secret out of love for her father, she told him she would never forgive him for his past actions and may never see him as the man he is trying to revive.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 31}} He then also learned that [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]] was now married to [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan the Accuser]].{{r|Realm of Kings: Inhumans Vol 1 2}}

He joined [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] and his fellow Avengers in an assault on the [[Olympus Group (Earth-616)|Olympus Group]] Headquarters, where he battled Amazons alongside (and got along well with) arrogant young [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)#Modern Era|Zeus]] and stabbed Zeus' [[Cephalus (Earth-616)|Huntsman]] through the chest with his own spear.{{r|Incredible Hercules #138|141}} His time with the Mighty Avengers ended when he finally learned that his "sister" was actually [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] in disguise and even Loki - being tortured by Quicksilver in a device built by [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Pym]] - didn't know where she was.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 34}}

Soon after, he regretted leaving the Mighty Avengers, finally having had found purpose and "playing" hero again.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 35}} But before he could try to live with the Wundagore gypsies again, he was called back by [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus Cho]] to aid in the [[Siege]] of Asgard,{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 36}} where he single-handedly defeated the Spear-of-Odin-wielding [[Mister X (Earth-616)|Mister X]] with a piece of debris.{{r|Thunderbolts #143}}

===Avengers Academy===
Pietro joined [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|the Avengers Academy]] as staff.{{r|Avengers Academy #1}} His first act as a teacher was to get [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]] to rebuild [[Arsenal Beta (Earth-616)|Arsenal]] and use it as a test against the students. He was then blackmailed by one of his students, [[Jeanne Foucault (Earth-616)|Finesse]] who deduced that Pietro was lying about being replaced by a Skrull, into teaching her the same methods and strategies that Magneto taught him in the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.{{r|Avengers Academy #2}} Pietro developed a closer student-teacher relationship with her, especially after Magneto paid a visit to the school and Finesse asked Pietro to teach her to be like him instead of Magneto.

===Corporate X-Factor===
[[File:All-New X-Factor Vol 1 1 Larroca Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Quicksilver and X-Factor]]
When his half-sister [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] was demolishing a bar and fighting cops while drunk, Quicksilver intervened to try and stop her. She didn't believe him that he repented his actions and started to shoot at him. He managed to knock her out, but before he could apprehend her on behalf of the Avengers, she was taken into custody by a shady policeman.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 260}} Concerned about her, Pietro tracked her to [[Serval Industries (Earth-616)|Serval Industries]] headquarters a bit later, where she had accepted a job to lead the company's superhero team adopting the name [[X-Factor (Serval Industries) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]. Claiming that he had a falling out with the Avengers, he volunteered to join the team, and Polaris accepted, with [[Harrison Snow (Earth-928)|Harrison Snow]]'s, CEO of Serval, blessing.{{r|All-New X-Factor #1}} Secretly, he was keeping an eye that Lorna be safe with Serval for [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers]] leader and her ex-boyfriend [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]].{{r|All-New X-Factor #3}}

Already on their first mission, Quicksilver was confronted with and rescued the former [[X-Cell (Earth-616)|X-Cell]] members [[Fatale (Earth-616)|Fatale]], [[Pantu Hurageb (Earth-616)|Reaper]], and [[Nils Styger (Earth-616)|Abyss]], who he had rendered explosive during his messianic phase, who had only survived by being pulled into the [[Brimstone Dimension]] by the latter and were now experimented on by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]].{{r|All-New X-Factor #1|2}}

Later, he stood up for a girl the team rescued to meet her biological parents, claiming that nobody should have to grow up without parents like [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Wanda]] and he did.{{r|All-New X-Factor #9}} He was confronted with the fallout later after she saw both her parents blow up.{{r|All-New X-Factor #12}}

After some time, [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] found that [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Lorna]] appeared to be safe and asked Quicksilver to join the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers]] again, referring to them as the "A" team in comparison to X-Factor being "second fiddle", but Quicksilver declined. He questioned that he meant anything to the Avengers as a person and stated that Lorna was his sister, too, and needed him more at the moment than [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Wanda]] did.{{r|All-New X-Factor #12}}

When confronted during a press conference by [[Fatale (Earth-616)|Fatale]] over his actions meant to repower mutants and his lying about a Skrull impostor having been responsible, Pietro finally admitted in public that he had been responsible and had tried to avoid facing the consequences, but now would submit to punishment. Shortly after, his [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|daughter]] showed up and told him he had won her respect back, and the two reconciled. He also acted humble accepting his responsibility when confronted by [[Gorgon Petragon (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] and [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]], even finding nice words about her divorce from [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan]].{{r|All-New X-Factor #12|13}}

He left the team, anyways, after [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Lorna]] found out that he had joined the team to spy on her.{{r|All-New X-Factor #20}}

===Avengers Unity Division===
Soon after the [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]], Quicksilver joined forces with Magneto to stop the Scarlet Witch, who had been affected by a spell gone wrong which turned her moral compass upside down, from murdering [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]. Wanda cast a spell to affect those with blood ties to her, and even though it affected Pietro, it didn't affect Magneto, revealing that they actually weren't Magnus' children.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #7}} With the help of the spirit of [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Doctor Voodoo]]'s brother [[Daniel Drumm (Earth-616)|Daniel]], Wanda was possessed so a reinversion spell could be cast, which successfully brought back to normal almost everybody affected by the inversion spell, including Wanda. In the wake of the conflict, Quicksilver joined the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]].{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #9}}

[[File:Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 9 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|The Avengers Unity Division]]
Wanda and Pietro returned to the Wundagore Mountain to find out their true parentage, and they were brought to the reformed [[Counter-Earth (High Evolutionary)|Counter-Earth]], which the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] used to test and try to create his perfect [[New Men]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 2 1}} The twins encountered the [[Low Evolutionary (Earth-616)|Low Evolutionary]], the leader of a resistance formed by the High Evolutionary's rejects.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 2 2}} After being tracked down and defeated by [[Luminous (Earth-616)|Luminous]], a new creation by the High Evolutionary with both Quicksilver's and Scarlet Witch's powers, Wanda and Pietro were brought to the High Evolutionary himself.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 2 3}} He revealed them that Django and Marya Maximoff were their true parents, as well as the truth that the twins were supposedly not mutants but they had been experimented on by the High Evolutionary. After escaping from the Evolutionary's experiments, Pietro and Wanda located the Avengers Unity Division, who had traveled to the Counter-Earth looking for the twins, and helped the inhabitants of Lowtown, a refuge for the High Evolutionary's rejects, from their creator's assault.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 2 4}} After the High Evolutionary was forced to flee through a portal once he was defeated, the Unity Division returned to Earth.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 2 5}}

During his time fighting alongside the Avengers Unity Division, Pietro developed feelings for his teammate [[Emily Guerrero (Earth-616)|Synapse]], though he couldn't bring himself to confess to her.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 18}} His recklessness cost Pietro his spot in the team after an attempt at showing off during a fight against the Juggernaut resulted in Synapse being gravely injured.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 29}}

===Secret Empire===
Quicksilver was one of the few superheroes not stuck outside Earth's orbit by the [[Planetary Defense Shield]] or trapped in [[Manhattan]] by the [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]]. Thus, he and Wanda answered [[Anthony Stark (Third A.I.) (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]'s call to defend [[Washington, D.C.]] as [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] moved to conquer the [[United States of America]]. However, Pietro and his allies were quickly defeated by the [[Army of Evil (Earth-616)|Army of Evil]], as well as an alternate [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America]] who wielded [[Mjolnir]].{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2017 Secret Empire}} 

In the aftermath of Hydra's conquest, Quicksilver became a member of the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]], a group of America's remaining superheroes that opposed Hydra's regime, situated at [[Mount|The Mount]] near [[Las Vegas]]. After Vegas was leveled by Hydra's [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier|Helicarriers]], Pietro aided in finding and rescuing survivors. Upon learning that Captain America's allegiance to Hydra was caused by the sentient [[Kobik|Cosmic Cube]], Quicksilver (along with [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]], and [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]]) volunteered to hunt down the Cube's fragments which had been scattered across the world.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 2}}

After recruiting [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Sam Wilson]] to help smuggle them out of America, Quicksilver and his group went to [[Alaska (State)|Alaska]] to retrieve the fragment held by [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]]. Shortly after arriving, they were confronted by Hydra's [[Avengers (Hydra) (Earth-616)|Avengers]], who also sought the fragment. The two groups engaged in combat, with Pietro fighting his sister, who had become possessed by [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]] following the battle of Washington D.C.. The battle was soon interrupted by Ultron, who invited both sides to "dinner". There, Ant-Man was successful in convincing Ultron into giving his shard to the Underground.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 4}}

After a series of dead ends and a battle against [[Hive (Earth-616)|Hive]] in [[Madripoor]], Quicksilver and the rest of his team returned to The Mount, seemingly giving up on their mission to find the fragments. When Hydra arrived at The Mount once more, Quicksilver was accused of being a spy for Hydra by Mockingbird, while he believed he was doing so to ensure Wanda's safety. Quicksilver retaliated by saying that he observed Mockingbird making secret calls to someone, and that she was likely the traitor. Ant-Man then revealed that he was Hydra's spy within the group, much to the anger of Quicksilver. Before the situation could further escalate, The Mount was attacked by the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], forcing Quicksilver to leave the conversation in order to assist in the evacuation of civilians.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 6}} 

Though he did not participate in the Underground's final assault on Washington D.C., Pietro was later seen helping to repair the city following the restoration of the United States.{{r|Secret Empire Omega Vol 1 1}}

===No Surrender===
Despite being kicked out of the team prior to Hydra's Empire, Pietro was pulled back into the Avengers when a cosmic game between the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] and the [[Challenger (Elder of the Universe) (Earth-616)|Challenger]] put the Earth at peril. Most superhumans on the planet were put in stasis through unknown means, so the remaining Avengers called in everyone available.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 675}} As part of this crisis, the Avengers intercepted confrontations between the [[Black Order (Earth-616)|Black Order]] and the [[Lethal Legion (Grandmaster) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]], two teams fighting each other on behalf of the Challenger and the Grandmaster, respectively. Pietro jumped into action against the orders of his fellow Avengers in an attempt to prove his worth to the team, but he was beaten up after the Scarlet Witch and [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Doctor Voodoo]]'s attempt to defreeze one of the heroes unwittingly caused the stasis to be passed onto Quicksilver in the middle of battle, leaving him at the mercy of the enemies.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 677}}

[[File:Avengers Vol 1 677 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
While recovering at the [[Avengers Auxiliary Headquarters]], Pietro noticed a small beacon of light moving around the heroes in stasis at an incredible speed,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684}} and deduced it was responsible for their condition.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 687}} Quicksilver attempted to get hold of the beacon to no avail. When the Challenger started rampaging through the Earth, Pietro convinced Wanda to use magic to bolster his powers even if it could come at a cost. Synapse additionally assisted Pietro by using her powers to help him break through the mental barrier that would prevent his body from moving too fast for its safety. Before leaving to race the beacon, Synapse and Pietro kissed. Quicksilver was successful in catching the orb and destroying it, though it caused him to vanish afterwards.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 688}} Pietro's sacrifice was not in vain, since catching the beacon released all of the heroes trapped by its grasp. The combined force of these heroes ensured the Challenger's defeat.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 689}}

After shattering the beacon, Pietro found himself trapped in a grey dimension from where the rest of the world appeared motionless.{{r|Quicksilver: No Surrender Vol 1 1}} Seemingly devoid of life, this dimension was inhabited by a group of incorporeal energy creatures. When Pietro appeared, these creatures mimicked him, taking his shape and appearance, as well as his memories and personality. Fueled by Pietro's rage and desperate for nourishment, these creatures tried to feed on the people Pietro knew, from Wanda to a man from whom Pietro used to get coffee.{{r|Quicksilver: No Surrender Vol 1 5}} Pietro's solitude was cut short when he discovered the existence of these energy beings, and he was forced to relentlessly fend off these creatures to save their unmoving victims.{{r|Quicksilver: No Surrender Vol 1 #1|#3}} Losing his grip on sanity, Quicksilver saw himself forced to confront his temperament and control his emotions to weaken and destroy the energy creatures.{{r|Quicksilver: No Surrender Vol 1 4}} The final of these monsters confronted Pietro and breached the barrier between dimensions, returning Quicksilver to the normal world. Realizing the creature's connection to Pietro's own pain and how it prompted him to cause harm, Pietro comforted his doppelganger, causing him to vanish.{{r|Quicksilver: No Surrender Vol 1 5}}

===Reign of X===
Pietro and Wanda were the only non-mutants backed up by [[Cerebro]] when they were believed to be mutants.{{r|X-Men: The Trial of Magneto Vol 1 1}} When Pietro found out his sister was dead and Magneto was believed to have done it, he ran to [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] to confront the man he once believed was his father. When he got there Magneto called him his son and he angrily beat him unconscious before breaking down in tears and being comforted by fellow speedster [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]]. Later after calming down he shared a drink at the [[Green Lagoon]] with his and Wanda's former Brotherhood of Evil Mutants teammates Toad and Mastermind.{{r|X-Men: The Trial of Magneto Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = '''Speed Physiology:''' Pietro's body is adapted towards the rigors of high-speed running. His cardiovascular and respiratory systems are many times more efficient than those of a normal human being. He metabolizes an estimated 95% of the caloric energy content of foodstuffs (normal humans use about 25%). The chemical processes of Quicksilver's musculature are so highly enhanced that his body does not generate fatigue poisons, the normal by-products of locomotion, which force the body to rest. Rather, his body constantly expels waste products during his accelerated respiration through exhalation. His joints are smoother and lubricated more efficiently than those of a normal human being. His tendons have the tensile strength of spring steel. His bones contain unknown materials significantly more durable than calcium to withstand the dynamic shocks of his feet touching the ground at speeds a human could never achieve or withstand. Quicksilver's lachrymose is more viscous than normal, thus preventing rapid evaporation and replenishment of surface fluids on his eyeballs under the influence of high wind velocity to occlude his vision.<ref>All material from {{cl|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #10}}.</ref>

*'''[[:Category:Supersonic Speed|Superhuman Speed]]:''' He was originally capable of running at speeds of 175 miles per hour.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #10}} He had sufficient energy reserves that enabled him to run at this average speed for roughly four hours before reducing his speed to replenish his body's store of energy.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #10}} Quicksilver has used his powers of acceleration for various feats, such as when he plucked an arrow out of the air from a standing start, dodged machine gun fire, and has created cyclone-like gusts of wind, which are able to knock a man off his feet.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #10}} He is able to run across the Atlantic Ocean and to oversea continents without having to stop,{{r|Avengers Vol 3 #40}} run up the sides of buildings effortlessly,{{Citation}} and even "fly" for short distances by using rapid air currents produced by his legs for thrust.{{r|Avengers #44}}

After his powers were upgraded by Isotope E, his running speed was increased until he was capable of easily reaching high supersonic speeds between Mach 4 (3,080 miles per hour) and Mach 5 (3,691, miles per hour).{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #2}} The true extent of his amplified abilities are unknown and are stated to be limitless,{{Citation}} he has been observed outrunning Thor's lightning bolts,{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 34}} running from Tibet to Indonesia in a few seconds,{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 27}} or covering half the Earth's distance in 92 seconds.{{Citation}} Quicksilver is also resistant to the effects of friction,{{Citation}} reduced oxygen up to a point where a human can no longer breathe,{{Citation}} and impact upon his body while moving at super-speeds.{{Citation}} He has traveled around the world by running on top of the ocean water and even ran all the way up Mount Everest without slowing down and went flying above cloud level as a result.{{Citation}} He has recently shown the ability to shift his molecules through solid objects, and transport people at speeds greater than the speed of sound without injuring them.{{Citation}}

*'''''Enhanced Durability:''''' Pietro's bones is super-durable and capable of resisting tremendous impact forces that could easily crush and kill a human without suffering any serious external or internal injuries.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 9}}

*'''''Superhuman Reflexes:''''' Pietro's reflexes are superior to the finest human athletes.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 9}} Quicksilver's practical reaction time is several times faster than a normal human's and the speed at which his brain processes information is heightened to a level commensurate with his bodily speed, enabling him to perceive his surroundings while traveling at high velocities.{{Citation}} Even in his earliest appearances he could perform feats of incredibly fast reaction-time, such as dodging a close range optic blast from Cyclops.{{r|Marvel Masterworks Vol 1}} He is able to move in a picosecond, even with a concussion.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 687|688}}

*'''''Accelerated Metabolism:''''' Pietro's metabolism is more than 15 times that of a normal human being, thus enabling him to heal much faster then normal and have an extended health and longevity.{{Citation}}

*'''''Superhuman Stamina:''''' Pietro's cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic systems are far more efficient than human norms. His body generates virtually no fatigue poisons.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 9}}

*'''''Superhuman Agility:''''' His physiology grants him agility that is above average compared to a normal human.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #3}}

*'''''Enhanced Strength:''''' Quicksilver's strength is slightly superhuman, sufficient to lift 1,000 lbs and leg-press one ton.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 9}}

*'''''Quick Intelligence:''''' He can process information at superhuman speeds, enabling him to read dozens of books in a matter of minutes or teach himself to play a musical instrument in a matter of moments.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 9}}

*'''''Navigation:''''' Quicksilver can sense vibrational patterns in his environment that enable him to always find magnetic north. This allows him to navigate and change course instinctively despite blurring at high speeds or lack of landmarks, like over open ocean.{{r|Avengers: Millennium #1}}

*'''''Molecular Acceleration/Destabilization:''''' Through the course of his life as a mutant, his super speed has granted him numerous abilities. One of the very peculiar ones was being able to vibrate his molecular structure at high speeds. Different writers used it for different purposes that were often absurd or completely ignored it to avoid obscurity. He has demonstrated the full effect which enables him to destabilize atomic matter by accelerating the target object's molecule structure, often causing it to fall apart or explode usually by touching it.{{r|X-Factor: The Quick and the Dead #1}} It is unknown if he can do this from a distance like his nephew Thomas Shepherd. He also had the ability to fly for short periods of time.{{r|X-Men #44}}
**'''''Intangibility:''''' Pietro also can use molecular destabilization to walk through solid objects.{{Citation}}

{{Navigation

'''Pre-molecular Chronokinesis:''' Pietro once had the power to vibrate his atoms so quickly he [[Time travel|traveled]] forward in time. His molecular speed that he generated displaced him out of the mainstream time/space so that he was able to propel himself into the future. He could leap from an hour to up to twelve days, and remain for several minutes to several hours before being recalled to his present time once his body tired, or he could return at will before his time was up.{ As he returned from his trip, he returned the exact moment he left so as to appear that he had been gone for half a nanosecond. He was able to bring inorganic objects from the future back to his correct time, although it was not shown what would happen if he attempted to bring organic objects with him.{{r|Son of M #2}}These new powers were having an affect on his physical health, as he was aging faster than normal as a result of using his powers.{{r|Son of M #6}}

'''Temporal Duplication:''' By leaping only mere seconds in time, he learned to create an indefinite number of "temporal dupes" that could be controlled with a certain amount of coordination.{{r|Son of M #6}}

After spending weeks in the presence of the stolen Terrigen crystals, relying solely upon them for sustenance, Pietro transformed even further. He was able to make greater leaps into the future.{{r|Son of M #6}} He retained these enhanced powers for a time by physically grinding the Terrigen crystals into his flesh.{{r|Silent War #3|4}}

'''Terrigenesis:''' He was able to apply superhuman templates to others. He focused on giving such templates to other mutants depowered by the Scarlet Witch. The process seemed to be temporary and somewhat unstable.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #7}}

'''X-Gene Feedback:''' If Pietro used his Terrigenesis on a Mutant whom kept their powers after M-Day, it caused their body to go into shock. The long-term effects (on both Quicksilver and the victim) of this ability were not seen. He first used it to incapacitate Guido of the Mutant Town detective agency X-Factor.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #11}}
}}

| Abilities               = 
'''Multilingual:''' In addition to English, Pietro is fluent in Russian.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 42}} Since he was born in Serbia, and raised there by Romani foster parents,{{r|Scarlet Witch Vol 2 11}} it's likely that he's also fluent in Serbian and one or more dialects of Romani.

'''Skilled Combatant:''' He has been trained in martial arts and other forms of combat by Captain America making him an excellent fighter.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 9}}

'''Musician:''' Pietro played the organ at [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] and [[Marlo Chandler (Earth-616)|Marlo Chandler]]'s wedding.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 418}}

| Strength                = Pietro possesses slightly superhuman strength in his upper body. His lower body is much stronger, as part of his body's adaptations for running. With his upper body he can lift (press) approximately [[Strength_Scale#Superhuman|1000 pounds]]. He can leg press approximately [[Strength_Scale#1_Ton|one ton]] under optimal conditions.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 9}}

| Weaknesses              = '''Mental Illnesses:''' Pietro has undergone mental breakdowns, episodes of mental illness, and severe depression. According to his sister, Pietro is a textbook sociopath which causes him to ruin his relationships through manipulation and force.{{r|Scarlet Witch Vol 2 9}}

| Notes                   = * Quicksilver is the only Marvel character who has appeared in Marvel films produced by different studios, Marvel Studios' ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' and 20th Century Fox's ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past (film)|X-Men Days of Future Past]]'' and ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''.

| Trivia                  = * Pietro initially disapproved of Wanda's marriage to Vision. The idea of it angered him so much that it put friction on their strong bond as twin siblings. He eventually came to accept his sister's decision and even considers the Vision as family despite the latter's dissolved marriage and current estranged relationship with Wanda.{{r|Avengers Assemble Annual Vol 1 1}}
* Pietro's relationship with Magneto has changed various times throughout his publication history, but has always remained conflicted. He and his sister were at first disdainful and later adversarial to Magneto due to his treatment of them before and after knowledge of their blood ties were discovered, but it was the Mutant's radical actions and terrorist activities that repulsed the twins. Even when Magneto withdrew from his violent activities and became the ruler of Genosha, an island and nation composed of mutants, Pietro only assisted him and attempted to improve his relationship with the now mutant ruler to distance himself from his own unforgiving nature. While their relationship improved, it was ultimately decimated after Magneto made no attempt to plea with Avengers and X-Men to spare Wanda on behalf of the consequences of her mental breakdown, or at the very least, to request more time to search for a cure for her condition.{{r|House of M #1}}
* While Pietro does not always remain with the Avengers for extended periods of time like his sister, the team has always meant a lot to him. He loves many of the founding and returning members as family and loves being an Avenger more than he will ever admit.{{r|House of M #7}}
* According to the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]], Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch "masquerade" as mutants, implying they are not.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 2 2}}
*Quicksilver has vowed that he and the Scarlet Witch will outlive every other member of the original [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 4}} Ever since the formation of [[Five (Earth-616)|the Five]], this seems unlikely since every mutant has the potential for immortality.
