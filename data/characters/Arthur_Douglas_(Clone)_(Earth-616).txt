| History                 = This clone was created by the [[Universal Church of Truth (Earth-TRN666)|Universal Church of Truth]] as part of their [[Destroyer Horde (Earth-616)|Destroyer Horde]], an army created from the original [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-TRN666)|Drax]] that had no will of their own, obeying only the will of the Church. While most of the Horde was destroyed by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], this clone was given a consciousness of his own by an alternate reality version of [[Heather Douglas (Earth-18897)|Moondragon]], who used her telepathic powers to collect memories of [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|the original Drax]] from everyone present to do so. Once this happened, he abandoned the Horde and the Church to follow the Guardians so that he could become who and what he really should be.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 12}}

The Guardians of the Galaxy had settled down in [[Halfworld]] when [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] approached them for their assistance in stopping the conquering rampage of the [[Olympians]], who had been reborn as bloodthirsty rogue gods. Drax was one of the Guardians who turned away out of concern for the safety of each other.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 1}} Some of the members, including Star-Lord, snuck away to assist Nova and were successful in their mission of trapping the Dark Olympians in an alternate dimension at the apparent cost of Quill's life.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 2}} As a result, Gamora broke off the team with the other Guardians who had stayed behind, including Drax, and formed their [[West Spiral Arm Guardians (Earth-616)|own team]] of Guardians of the Galaxy to return to their mercenary ways. During this time, Drax reunited with the original [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]], the daughter of his genetic template.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 3}} For their first mission, the mercenary Guardians came at odds with their former teammates, but eventually reached a truce.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 6}}

Star-Lord returned from the other-dimensional world of [[Morinus]], where he had spent a hundred of years of his life, albeit unaging, to herald the escape of the Dark Olympians from their imprisonment.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 9}} The two Guardians teams came together for the final confrontation against the Dark Olympians which saw their defeat.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 11}} In the aftermath, the Guardians of the Galaxy were sanctioned by the [[Galactic Council (Earth-616)|Galactic Council]] as protectors of the cosmos in light of the increasing uncertainty of the galactic landscape, providing them with headquarters in the space station [[Proscenium]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 12}}
