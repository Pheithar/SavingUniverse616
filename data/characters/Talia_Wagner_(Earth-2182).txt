| History                 = ===Early Life===
Daughter of [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-2182)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-2182)|Scarlet Witch]], Nocturne inherited her father's blue fur, three-toed hands and feet, a tail, yellow eyes and pointed ears. As a third-generation mutant, however, Nocturne also developed her own abilities.

Talia grew up with the [[X-Men (Earth-2182)|X-Men]], who at this time consisted of: Team Leader [[James Howlett (Earth-2182)|Wolverine]], who would not engage in active combat as he was mortally injured; Field Leader [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-2182)|Nightcrawler]]; [[Katherine Pryde (Kate) (Earth-2182)|Shadowcat]], who was later in an chrono-displacement accident and was replaced with her [[Katherine Pryde (Kitty) (Earth-2182)|younger self]] just after she joined the X-Men; [[James Proudstar (Earth-2182)|Thunderbird]]; [[Phoenix Force (Earth-2182)|Phoenix]], the Phoenix force inhabiting the empty body of [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-2182)|Colossus]]; and [[Armageddon (Earth-2182)|Armageddon]], the son of [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-2182)|Apocalypse]].{{r|X-Men: Millennial Visions Vol 1 2000}}

Nocturne became a full member of the team and was romantically involved with James Proudstar. For a long time she lived in her father's shadow, and he trained her very hard, often at the expense of her feelings. When [[Scott Summers (Earth-2182)|Cyclops]] attacked the mansion with [[Exiles (Earth-1026)|his Exiles]], T.J. was out with Kitty Pryde.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 41}} Upon returning and seeing the attack; however, T.J. was able to rally the students to help delay the attack, and then possess Armageddon, a telekinetic, to free Wolverine and seriously injure the insane Cyclops. Having proven her skills and ability, she was able to reconcile somewhat with her father.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 42}}

===Becoming an Exile===
T.J. later was the first member of the [[Exiles (Multiverse)|Exiles]] to become "unstuck in time," but she has never assumed any kind of leadership role, and maintained her freewheeling attitude.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 1}} Over time, she became intimate with the Exiles' own [[John Proudstar (Earth-1100)|Thunderbird]], and became pregnant with his child.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 10}} One of her most difficult missions was the trial of [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]], in which she had to fight [[Jean Grey (Earth-8649)|an alternate incarnation]] of her "[[Jean Grey (Earth-2182)|Aunt Jean]]," and had to ignore [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-8649)|that world's version of her father]] during that difficult time.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 3}}

Outstripping that by far was the mission to a [[Deviant Skrulls/Alternate Universe Skrulls#Earth-5692|Skrull]]-dominated [[Earth-5692]], in which she and the others were forced to fight in gladiatorial combat against other super-beings.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 8}} That mission ended with the arrival of [[Galan (Earth-5692)|Galactus]] and Thunderbird's self-sacrifice to save the world.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 10}} Due to the stress of losing her lover, T.J. lost the baby a few weeks later, an incident she kept secret for weeks. She has became withdrawn and depressed, and refused to talk about her feelings.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 16}}

Over time, T.J. healed and became a mainstay of the team. On her first visit to [[Earth-616]], she met and bonded with [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], who thought that her parents' pairing was intriguing.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 28|30}} Later, T.J. was left behind on Earth-616, and was about to knock on the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|X-Mansion]] and see her "father" again when [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]] intercepted her and made her another offer.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 46|48}}

===Infiltrating the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants===
A few months later, Nocturne showed up as a member of [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)#Exodus' Brotherhood|Exodus' Brotherhood]] during an attack on [[Philadelphia (Pennsylvania)|Philadelphia]]. While her teammates were mostly homicidal, Nocturne did her best to keep civilians out of harm's way. The [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] defeated the Brotherhood, prompting Exodus to attack the X-Mansion, using [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] as his ace in the hole. Juggernaut recognized T.J. as a hero and seemingly beat her to a pulp. In fact, T.J. told him she was trying to figure out Exodus's motivations and Juggernaut told her he was also undercover. When the fighting actually started, Nocturne was able to possess [[Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616)|Black Tom Cassidy]], the most dangerous foe, long enough for him to be swept into the black hole in [[Shen Xorn (Earth-616)|Shen Xorn]]'s head along with the rest of the Brotherhood. Unfortunately, Nocturne and Juggernaut were swept into the black hole too.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 161|164}}

===Escaping the Mojoverse===
Nocturne and Juggernaut subsequently ended up on [[Mojoworld]], where they were sold to [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]] himself. Nocturne was able to possess [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]] and force her to open a portal to [[Earth]], where they emerged in the [[Danger Room]]; however, though T.J.'s possessions usually knock her hosts out for 24 hours, Spiral was faking, and she kept the portal open to allow Mojo to follow T.J. and Juggernaut back to Earth.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 460}} Spiral changed them and the X-Men to [[X-Babies (Mojoverse)|babies]], except the newly-resurrected [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]], but the X-Men managed to defeat Mojo and regain their rightful forms.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 461}}

===[[House of M]]===
An [[Talia Darkholme (Earth-58163)|alternate version of Nocturne]] was sought after by [[Callisto (Earth-58163)|Callisto]]'s [[Marauders (Earth-58163)|Marauders]] for having royal [[Erik Magnus (Earth-58163)|Magnus]] blood as a result of being a daughter of the alternate [[Wanda Magnus (Earth-58163)|Scarlet Witch]], but was protected by [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-58163)|Psylocke]] and [[Rachel Summers (Earth-58163)|Marvel Girl]]. Marvel Girl allowed T.J. to possess her in order to keep her out of the Marauders' reach, but Nocturne ended up taking control, and in a confused daze, flew up and out. Psylocke pursued, eventually culminating in a telekinetic blade battle, which Psylocke won. This allowed Marvel Girl's own consciousness to resurface.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 463|465}}

===Joining New Excalibur===
After the House of M reality warp, Nocturne joined [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|New Excalibur]], alongside Juggernaut, [[Sage (Earth-616)|Sage]], [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]], [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]], and [[Peter Wisdom (Earth-616)|Pete Wisdom]].{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 1}}

T.J. eventually suffered a stroke while working with New Excalibur, resulting in numerous after effects including memory loss, partial paralysis, and the inability to speak.{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 16}} As she worked to recover, she continued to help her teammates, and saved many lives during the battle against [[Bran Bardic (Earth-70518)|Albion]] by possessing one of his [[Shadow-Captains (Earth-616)|Shadow-Captains]].{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 20|24}}

===Returning to the Exiles===
Nocturne ultimately learned that her former lover, Thunderbird, was no longer comatose, and after defeating [[James Jaspers (Earth-616)|Mad Jim Jaspers]], reunited with the Exiles.{{r|X-Men: Die by the Sword Vol 1 1|5}} Nocturne and Thunderbird then went with [[Clarice Ferguson (Earth-295)|Blink]] to [[Earth-3470]] so that [[Heather McDaniel (Earth-3470)|Sasquatch]] could help T.J. continue to recover from her stroke.{{r|Exiles Vol 1 100}}

Once T.J. completely recovered from her stroke, she returned to the Exiles, and briefly merged with the [[Panoptichron|Crystal Palace]] alongside Heather and [[Kevin Sidney (Earth-1081)|Morph]], before she took charge of the team while Blink was off recruiting new members.{{r|Exiles Vol 2 6}}

===Reunion with Blink===
After Blink was forced by the [[Tallus]] to form a new team, past iterations of T.J. and Morph were reunited with their friend while under the thrall of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-18136)|Pastor Xavier]]. They were freed when [[Valkyrie (Earth-22681)|Valkyrie]] attacked him in rage and grief at the death of her [[Valkyrior Steeds|steed]], [[Elendil (Earth-22681)|Elendil]], and aided Blink's new team in defeating him, though not without the loss of Morph.{{r|Exiles Vol 3 7}} While commiserating over his death, T.J. and Blink were summoned to the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]] by a rogue faction of Watchers called the [[Tribunal of Watchers (Multiverse)|Tribunal of Watchers]] to stand trial in the present for the team's interference with the [[Glossary:Timestream|timestream]].<!-- {{r|Exiles Vol 3 8}} -->

Though the group was locked down with power dampeners, T.J. was able to use her probability-manipulating hex bolts to break her restraints and they quickly fought back; however, the battle was cut short by the Tallus activating once more and sending them to another strange reality,{{r|Exiles Vol 3 8}} one where each took the place of a character from Arabian Nights, with T.J. becoming Scheherazade herself.{{r|Exiles Vol 3 9}}
