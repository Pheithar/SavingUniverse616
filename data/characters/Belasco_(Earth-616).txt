===Early history===
'''Belasco''' was a sorcerer in 13th Century [[Italy]]{{r|Marvel Atlas #1|; [[Italy]]'s entry}} who used his knowledge of alchemy and the black arts to contact the "[[Elder Gods]]" (actually extradimensional demonic entities known as the [[Mabdhara]], masters of the [[N'Garai]]).{{r|Marvel Zombies: The Book of Angels, Demons & Various Monstrosities #1|; Belasco's entry}} He forged a pact with them enabling them to cross the barrier to our dimension using a pentagonal arrangement of five [[Bloodstones]]. In return, Belasco was granted immortality and immense mystical power. He was also given a demonic appearance, as he was intended to form a new race of Earth-dwelling demons.{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage Vol 1 12}}

===Sorcerers' Guild===
As part of the [[Sorcerers Guild (Earth-616)|Sorcerers Guild]] he opposed [[Ebrok (Earth-616)|Ebrok]]'s creation of the [[Cat People (Demons)|Cat People]]. The group banished the Cat People to the other dimensional netherworld of the [[Land Within]].{{r|What If? Vol 1 35}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 314}}

===Dante's Inferno===
Belasco's early history was told by the poet [[Dante Alighieri (Earth-616)|Dante]], though there was some dispute as to the veracity of these accounts. To this end, he kidnapped Bice "Beatrice" dei Portinari, beloved of Dante, to give birth to the first of this new race. He fled with her to the [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] isle of [[Pangea (Savage Land)|Pangea]], where the Elder Gods directed him to [[Mt. Flavius]], where their summoning ritual could take place. While en route, Belasco raped Beatrice, and she was nine months pregnant by the time they arrived. He embarked onto the island, closely pursued by Dante, and took Beatrice into a network of underground passages designed to resemble [[Hell]]. Dante found them just in time to witness Beatrice dying in childbirth and, enraged, he attacked Belasco. During the battle, a pipe was accidentally struck, releasing an unknown liquid that placed Belasco in suspended animation. At some point on the island, Belasco also lost the locket containing the Bloodstones.{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage Vol 1 11|12}} 

===Return===
In recent years, the volcano mountain became active again, releasing Belasco. He quickly located the locket and found a new sacrifice, [[Shanna the She-Devil|Shanna O'Hara]]. He placed her under his mental control and began the spell. However, just as he was almost finished, Shanna's mate [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]] appeared and hurled the locket into the volcano, sealing away the [[Elder Gods]] and apparently destroying Belasco.{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage Vol 1 11|12}} 

===Trapped in Limbo===
However, he instead was trapped in [[Limbo (Otherplace)|Limbo]], where he spent his years conquering it. Once complete, he drew the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] to him with the intent to use Kitty & Illyana as means for his freedom of limbo and his Elder Gods' access to Earth.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 160}} They all managed to escape save the seven-year-old [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Illyana Rasputin]], whom he made his apprentice. He shaped part of her soul into a Bloodstone, giving her great potential for power and allowing him to control her. However, upon reaching the age of fourteen, she rebelled against him, driving him from Limbo. Now its new master, she returned to her own world only seconds after the X-Men had returned, and shortly after joined the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] as Magik.{{r|Magik (Illyana and Storm Limited Series) Vol 1 1|4}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 15}} Magik was later deposed as the ruler of Limbo by the demons [[S'ym (Earth-616)|S'ym]] and [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]], the latter of whom was destroyed, and also restored Illyana's lost childhood.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 73|74}}

Belasco eventually took control of Limbo once more. The cultist [[Samuel Smith (Earth-616)|Sammy Smith]], alias "the Rev" (a Jim Jones analogue) worshiped Belasco as Lucifer. The Rev fought the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] twice, the second time alongside the Punisher's longtime foe [[William Russo (Earth-616)|Jigsaw]]. When the Punisher killed Jigsaw, the Rev used his Belasco-granted powers to resurrect the thug, although both were defeated despite Smith's gift of demonic magic.{{r|Punisher Vol 2 39|40}}

Belasco also turned [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] ally [[Ananym (Earth-616)|Witchfire]] against her team by influencing her demonic side. She finally was restored to normal and returned to [[Beta Flight (Earth-616)|Beta Flight]], Alpha Flight's support group.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 124}}

:''It was strongly suggested that Belasco is Witchfire's father or at least that Witchfire believes so.''{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 124}}

Later, Belasco and the fear demon [[D'Spayre (Earth-616)|D'Spayre]] contested to corrupt [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], the son of [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]], who had been the ally of S'ym and N'Astirh. Belasco banished D'Spayre and summoned himself, Cable, and Cable's ally [[Aleytys Forrester (Earth-616)|Lee Forrester]] to Limbo, where S'ym threw Belasco out of his way and fought with Cable. Cable won, and he and Lee returned to Earth.{{r|Cable Vol 1 14}}

It was eventually revealed that Illyana's best friend [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] had received Illyana's [[Soulsword]] after Illyana had died; in dying, she had bonded the Soulsword to Kitty's own essence. After Kitty's team [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] fought off several claimants to the sword, [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]]'s girlfriend [[Jimaine Szardos (Earth-616)|Amanda Sefton]] was given the sword. She then gave the sword to her mother, [[Margali Szardos (Earth-616)|Margali Szardos]], who was in turn kidnapped by Belasco and brought to Limbo. Nightcrawler and Sefton freed her, and Sefton secretly took the sword and adopted the code-name Magik for herself. Belasco and his allies, the N'Garai demons, fought the X-Men again soon after, but were defeated by the X-Men with the assistance of the new Magik, who revealed herself to be Amanda Sefton.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 103}}

===Quest for Magik===
Belasco had been cast into an even lower level of hell by his disappointed gods, but was eventually able to ritually sacrifice a low level demon to regain access to the Limbo dimension after looking in on Earth and seeing a version of [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-58163)|Magik]] alive there. Belasco fought and defeated everything that the new Magik, Amanda Sefton, threw at him and cast her out of Limbo. Belasco was unable to find Magik alive again on Earth but sensed her presence on the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]] (who were unaware they had encountered her when the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] altered the world).{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 37|38}} 

Belasco questioned and tortured them, during which it was revealed that Belasco was also seemingly in love with Magik as well as desiring her powers. Belasco was eventually defeated by the partially resurrected Illyana, once again having become Darkchild and lacking a soul, alongside [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] who stabbed him with her [[Souldagger]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 38|41}}

===Satana's Soul===
Satana visited the [[Apache Diamond Casino]] and took part in a high stakes poker game with what she thought were collegiate nerds. But it was revealed that they were Belasco, [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]], [[Asmodeus (Demon) (Earth-616)|Asmodeus]], [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]], and [[Lucifer (Earth-616)|Lucifer]] in disguise. She lost her soul during the game so enlisted [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] to help get it back. He attacked the gamblers cutting them to pieces and revealing their true natures. Satana found a loophole and married Deadpool to break the deal, they tried to kill Deadpool but due to his healing factor they couldn't break the "Till death do us part" clause.{{r|Deadpool Team-Up Vol 2 892}}

===Chaos King===
When the [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (Earth-616)|Chaos King]] confronted [[Marduk Kurios (Earth-616)|Marduk Kurios]] to steal his power, Belasco joined the [[Hell Lords (Earth-616)|Hell Lords]] and many other [[Demons]], but they were defeated. He returned to his throne when [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] defeated the Chaos King.{{r|Chaos War: Chaos King Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                 = Belasco was one of the most powerful sorcerers on Earth and possesses a wide knowledge of spells, allowing him to shoot mystical rays, control the minds of humans and animals, and transform himself and others, among other things.

He proved to be powerful enough to hold off [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury (Cessily Kincaid)]] and [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]] simultaneously, despite their resistances to [[magic]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 39}}

* '''Near Invulnerability:''' He was also endowed by the Elder Gods with immortality and apparent invulnerability. The exception to this is his own sword, which was forged by the Elder Gods themselves. It was this which cut off his right arm under unrevealed circumstances.{{citation}}
