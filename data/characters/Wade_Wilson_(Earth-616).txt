| History                 = 
===Early Years===
[[File:Wade Wilson (Earth-616) as a child from Deadpool Vol 4 60.jpg|left|thumb]]
Wade had conflicting memories of his childhood. He once recalled that his father abandoned his mother while she was pregnant with him and she took out her anger on him until, as an adult, he beat her instead.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 36}} He later recalled that his mother died when he was five and that his father, an army officer, became abusive,{{r|Wolverine: Origins Vol 1 24}} causing Wade to grow up to be a thug and criminal. When his father got his act together and tried to rein in his son, one of Wade's friends shot and killed him.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #19}} However, he told a writer that his father was a teller of bad jokes who abandoned him and his mother while he was a boy. His mother turned to humor, alcohol and home shopping networks as a coping mechanism. He believed that he ran away from home so that his mother wouldn't need to spend what little money she had left on him.{{r|X-Men Origins: Deadpool #1}}

However, it was eventually revealed that his parents were still together, living in [[Canada]] and had kept Wade's room as he had left it but Wade himself did not recognize the house, his parents or his room when he returned there as an adult.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 34}}

After leaving home, he appears to have joined the [[United States Army Special Forces (Earth-616)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] but despite his superior skills, he was drummed out for not following orders that conflicted with his moral code. After a failed suicide attempt just before his nineteenth birthday, Wade was invited to join a clandestine group of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-sponsored mercenary assassins thanks to his military record, assured that his targets would all deserve death.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 26}}

Little is known of Wilson's subsequent activities with this group. At one point he was active in Tangier, [[Morocco]] where he romanced a woman named Francie. When this relationship soured, he traveled throughout [[Asia]], and was hired in [[Japan]] by a crime lord, the [[Boss (Yakuza) (Earth-616)|Boss]], to infiltrate a sumo-wrestling ring owned by a rival criminal, the [[Oyakata (Earth-616)|Oyakata]]. Wilson spent three years as a wrestler under the Oyakata's tutelage and became romantically involved with his mentor’s daughter, [[Sazae (Earth-616)|Sazae]]. When the Boss finally ordered the Oyakata's murder, Wilson refused to complete his assignment, allegedly the first time he had ever done so, and relocated to the [[United States of America|United States]].{{r|Deadpool Team-Up Vol 1 1}}

In America, Wade met and fell in love with mutant teenage prostitute [[Vanessa Carlysle (Earth-616)|Vanessa Carlysle]], with whom he shared dreams of a better life. Wilson was subsequently hired by Middle Eastern interests to assassinate a blind British Government operative named Althea, also known as [[Blind Al (Althea) (Earth-616)|Blind Al]]. Upon arrival to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]] base where she was stationed, he killed everyone except for Al who had fled.

Those who put the contract out on Al sought vengeance for his failure by targeting Vanessa, who was rescued by [[Zoe Culloden (Earth-616)|Zoe Culloden]], an employee of the inter-dimensional firm [[Landau, Luckman & Lake (Earth-616)|Landau, Luckman, Lake, and LeQuare]]. Culloden was keeping Wilson under surveillance, believing he was destined to play a vital part in a potential threat to the world. Learning that he had developed 34 inoperable cancerous tumors, Wilson broke up with his girlfriend Vanessa rather than force her to remain with a terminally ill man. He even gave up his chemo treatments, not wishing to prolong things.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 -1}}

===Weapon X===
Back in [[Canada]], he was offered hope in the form of [[Department K (Earth-616)|Department K]], a special weapons development branch of the Canadian government. Wilson became a test subject in Department K’s branch of the joint U.S./Canadian superhuman enhancement project, the [[Weapon X Project (Earth-616)|Weapon X]] Program; his cancer was temporarily arrested via the implantation of a healing factor derived from another Department K agent, the mutant adventurer [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].

Wilson was active in a covert field unit alongside the near-invulnerable [[Bernard Hoyster (Earth-616)|Sluggo]] and the cyborgs [[Garrison Kane (Earth-616)|Kane]] and [[Gregory Terraerton (Earth-616)|Slayback]]. Vanessa herself was later affiliated with the team after having manifested mutant shapeshifting abilities, calling herself Copycat.

During one mission, Wilson killed his teammate Slayback. Shortly thereafter, his healing factor began to destabilise, bringing his cancer back from remission and causing deformities in his flesh. As a result, he was rejected from the Weapon X Program and sent to the [[Hospice]], allegedly a government facility where failed superhuman operatives were treated. However, unknown to the Canadian government, the Hospice's patients served as experimental subjects for [[Emrys Killebrew (Earth-616)|Doctor Killebrew]] and his sadistic assistant [[Ajax (Francis) (Earth-616)|Ajax]] (known then as the Attendant), with the patients placing bets in a "deadpool" as to how long each subject would live. Killebrew subjected Wilson to various torturous experiments for his own deranged satisfaction.

In due course, Wilson formed a romantic relationship with the cosmic entity [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]], who regarded him as a kindred spirit. Wilson started trying to kill himself, to join Death - going so far as to start taunting Ajax by saying his real name (Francis) over and over, which earned him the respect of his fellow Hospice patients. Then Ajax, angered by Wilson’s taunts, lobotomized [[Worm (Hospice) (Earth-616)|Worm]], the closest thing Wilson had to a friend. At Death’s prompting, Wilson killed Worm to end his suffering.

However, under Killebrew's rules, any patient who killed another was to be executed; Ajax subsequently tore out Wilson’s heart and left him for dead, but Wilson’s thirst for vengeance was so strong that it jump started his healing factor, regenerating his heart, although not curing his scarred body. Wilson then escaped the now-empty room and attacked the guards, making his way to Ajax. Wilson shot him in the chest with two automatic rifles, leaving him for dead. Taking the name Deadpool, he escaped from the Hospice with his fellow patients.

===Mercenary===
Following his escape, Deadpool served for a time as an enforcer alongside the surgically altered criminal [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]]. He soon returned to his freelance mercenary activities, donning a costume in keeping with his new identity. At some point during his mercenary career, he was employed as an assassin by Wilson Fisk, the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] of crime. He also clashed with Wolverine, at that time a spy for the Canadian government. At some point during these years, Deadpool caught up with Blind Al and kept her a prisoner in his home. Al’s attempts to escape only resulted in death for those whose help she sought, leaving her no choice but to resign herself to captivity.

Some years after escaping the Hospice, Deadpool, perhaps seeking compensation for the injuries inflicted upon him by Killebrew, returned to the Canadian government and was treated by Doctor Walter Langkowski, the bestial [[Walter Langkowski (Earth-616)|Sasquatch]] of Canada’s super-team [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]]. He also acquired a teleportation device around this time.

Deadpool soon found government work unsuited to his temperament, and he abandoned this endeavor. Hired by the criminal genius known as [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|The Wizard]], Deadpool at first went to the wrong address and received a job impersonating the criminal Hobgoblin. When again contacted by The Wizard, he joined with fellow criminals the [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] and the [[Frank Schlichting (Earth-616)|Constrictor (Frank Schlichting)]] in a short-lived version of the [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]].

Afterwards, Wade was hired by [[Francis Talbot (Earth-42466)|Francis Talbot]] to use a time machine and a gun that erased people from existence in order to alter American history so that his family could profit the most from America's various wars,{{r|Deadpool vs. X-Force #3}} eventually making Talbot a world leader.{{r|Deadpool vs. X-Force #4}} This brought Deadpool into conflict with [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] for the first time. Cable managed to erase Talbot from existence, thereby restoring history to its rightful place, though seemingly intertwining Cable and Deadpool's fates.{{r|Deadpool vs. X-Force #2}}

===[[Secret Wars (1984 Event)|Secret Wars]]===
{{MessageBox
| Message = The canonicity of Deadpool's involvement with the Venom symbiote is somewhat conflicted (''See [[#Trivia|trivia]]'').
}}

[[File:Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Deadpool bonds to [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a shapeshifting black-and-white costume]].]]
Early in his career as a vigilante, Deadpool was one of the superheroes transported to [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]] by the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] in order to participate in the original Secret Wars - though his proclivity for violence put him at odds with the other heroes. After an alien woman named [[Zsaji (Earth-616)|Zsaji]] used her healing powers to remove his scars, Deadpool - revelling in his now-handsome appearance - fell in love with her. After noticing Thor had acquired a new costume, Deadpool meddled with a machine hoping for a makeover and wound up with [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a shapeshifting black-and-white costume]]. Quickly realizing the symbiotic costume was alive and interfacing with his mind, Deadpool returned it to its prison just before Spider-Man arrived and bonded to it himself. Following Doctor Doom hijacking the Beyonder's power, Deadpool had an affair with the Wasp, who had become attracted to him - Zsaji having fallen in love with Colossus. When Doom killed all the other heroes, Deadpool had Zsaji resurrect Mr. Fantastic and Colossus - at the cost of her own life - and then allowed Mr. Fantastic to use his healing factor to resurrect the other heroes, returning him to his original cancer-ridden appearance. When he attempted to resume his affair with the Wasp, she was horrified and disgusted at the sight of his scarred visage and rejected him. In the final battle, Deadpool intercepted the Beyonder's attempt to reclaim his power from Doom and was warped to the [[Beyond-Realm|Foundation of Reality]], where he became consciously aware of his nature as a fictional character. When Deadpool persuaded the Beyonder to grant everyone's wishes, using his own to bring Zsaji back to life, the Wasp - traumatized after seeing Deadpool's scarred appearance - used her wish to erase his involvement from everyone's memories.{{r|{{cl|Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars Vol 1}}-[[Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars Vol 1 4|4]]}}

===Venompool===
During a mission to steal a statue of Kali from [[Dansen Macabre (Earth-616)|Dansen Macabre]], Deadpool wound up in a battle with her acolytes and a hypnotized [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]]. Before he could be hypnotized himself, Deadpool was rescued by the black-and-white symbiote - which Spider-Man had rejected after learning it was alive, and which was being hunted by extraterrestrial bounty-hunters [[Killer Thrill (Earth-616)|Killer Thrill]], [[Guzz (Earth-616)|Guzz]], and [[Coldwar (Earth-616)|Coldwar]]. Recognizing the symbiote but opting to keep it this time, the new-and-improved Venompool defeated Dansen Macabre and teamed up with the [[Power Pack (Earth-616)|Power Pack]] to defeat some [[Zn'rx]] soldiers, devouring them when they tried to escape.{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 2}} He then teamed up with [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] - who had mistaken him for Spider-Man - to defeat [[Lorina Dodson (Earth-616)|White Rabbit]]; devouring Coldwar when the three alien bounty hunters attacked.{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 3}} When the symbiote lashed out in rage following [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]] mistaking Venompool for Spider-Man, Wade unsuccessfully attempted to calm it down and later passed the argument off as a dream.{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 4}} Following Killer Thrill capturing Spider-Man, Venompool cut off and ate her arm - forcing her to retreat - but Wade refused to let the symbiote kill Spider-Man and it returned to [[Our Lady of Saints Church]] in time to encounter its [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|next host]].{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 5}}

===Heroes for Hire===
At some point during this period, Deadpool tried to join the [[Heroes for Hire (Power Man & Iron Fist) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]], and accompanied them on a mission to protect a bodega from Midtown [[Manhattan]] from a [[White Man (Earth-616)|mob boss]]. During the mission, [[Carmelita Camacho (Earth-616)|Carmelita Camacho]], the daughter of the bodega's owner, thought that they were about to die and had sex with him.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 13}} Unbeknown to Deadpool, Carmelita had been impregnated, and she raised the kid, [[Eleanor Camacho (Earth-616)|Eleanor Camacho]], alone.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 16}}

===The Butler===
As a result of being cured of cancer, Deadpool caught the attention of a former Department K member [[Bartol Utler (Earth-616)|Butler]], whose sister also had the disease and was being kept in stasis until a cure could be found. The Butler contacted Deadpool, who would provide tissues and blood samples "for the orphans."{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 19}}{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 34}} The Butler would sometimes need Wade on-site for longer stretches, for which Deadpool sometimes used to be kept sedated under simulations, explaining why Wade's memory would malfunction in the future.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 19}} During that time, the Butler also used mind-wipe drugs to manipulate Deadpool into doing his bidding. To test how far could he push Deadpool, the Butler sent Wilson to kill his parents.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 34}}

Wade ultimately grew tired of Butler's experiments, and quit the program. However, over the next years, the Butler would periodically assault Deadpool during his sleep, or after drugging him, to keep collecting samples for his work.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 19}} As an "insurance policy" to Deadpool's desertion, the Butler kidnapped Carmelita and Eleanor, sending the latter to live with his brother while Carmelita was sent to [[Korea|North Korea]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 29}}

===Tolliver===
Through the Butler, he found employment with the time-traveling arms merchant [[Tyler Dayspring (Earth-4935)|Tolliver]]{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 29}}, in whose service he was reunited with Sluggo and Copycat. Unknown to Deadpool, Tolliver subsequently sent Copycat to impersonate another mutant mercenary, [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]]. Deadpool also recruited a man named [[Jack Hammer (Earth-616)|Weasel]] to act as his weapon supplier, and the two became fast friends, despite numerous acts of violence against him.

After some time in Tolliver's service, Deadpool was sent to kill [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], the mutant soldier from the future who was in fact Tolliver’s father and in whose company Copycat was impersonating Domino. However, Deadpool met defeat at the hands of Cable and his new charges, the young mutants in training known as the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]].{{r|New Mutants #98}}

When Cable reorganized the New Mutants as [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]], Tolliver was seemingly slain in battle with them, setting off a search by his various mercenaries for the advanced technology he had left behind. Deadpool’s participation in the search was interrupted by the surprising interference of Slayback, who had cybernetically reconstituted himself after being slain by Deadpool and was eager for revenge.{{r|X-Force #2|24}} In the course of the ensuing battle, Copycat was gravely injured, and Deadpool sacrificed part of his healing ability to save her life.{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Vol 1 1}}-[[Deadpool: The Circle Chase Vol 1 4|4]]}}

===Genesis Coalition===
The [[Genesis Coalition (Earth-616)|Genesis Coalition]] hired Deadpool to capture [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]] - a mission that also threw him into battle against [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], whom was then no longer going by his real identity. He took the fight to the sewers where he was 'convinced' to hand over the information regarding his mission, for triple his commission. He was also put on retainer, in case he thought about choosing to take a mission against Sable's interests again.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #23|30}}

===Siryn===
Deadpool helped X-Force member [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] against the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] and her uncle, [[Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616)|Black Tom Cassidy]], who had forced Killebrew into their service. Deadpool developed a strong attachment to Siryn, who only partially returned his feelings.{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Vol 2 1}}-[[Deadpool Vol 2 4|4]]}}

Unsure of his worthiness, Deadpool sought out Copycat, only to find she was now dating Kane. Deadpool fought both Kane and Wolverine, who had been sent to check on Kane by a mutual friend.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 88}} Deadpool was subsequently abducted by information brokers seeking a cure for the [[Legacy Virus]] but was rescued by Wolverine and the mutant mercenary [[Christoph Nord (Earth-616)|Maverick]].{{r|Wolverine Annual Vol 1 1995}}

He teamed up with Siryn again for a mission.{{r|X-Force #46}} Together they escaped from being kidnapped by [[Doctor Weisman (Earth-616)|Dr. Weisman]].{{r|X-Force #47}} Shatterstar was forced to battle a mentally unstable Deadpool.{{r|X-Force #56}}

===Hellhouse===
When this plan also failed, Deadpool sought to reclaim his position as the Kingpin’s assassin, only to be challenged by fellow assassin [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]]. Deadpool began frequenting the mercenary hangout called the [[Hellhouse (School)|Hellhouse]], where the diminutive [[Bob Stirrat (Earth-616)|Patch]] issued assignments.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 1}} There he routinely clashed with [[T-Ray (Earth-616)|T-Ray]], a voodoo-sorcerer and assassin of whom he maintained a constant dislike.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 2|7}}

===Mithras===
Deadpool was approached by [[Zoe Culloden (Earth-616)|Zoe Culloden]] of the rechristened [[Landau, Luckman & Lake (Earth-616)|Landau, Luckman & Lake]] who believed he was destined to be the [[Mithras]], one who would help usher in a golden age for Earth. Skeptical, Deadpool turned Zoe away, only to be hit with a string of personal failures. These included the alienation of Weasel and Blind Al (whom had been meeting, against Deadpool’s instructions), a defeat at the hands of T-Ray, and loss of good grace at [[Hellhouse (School)|Hellhouse]].{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Vol 1 1}}-[[Deadpool Vol 1 15|15]]}}

He met up with [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]] to do a pro-bono job in [[Greece]], where the assassin told him that he was losing his edge - as shown by the fact he only wounded the people he was supposed to be killing. Deadpool disputed the fact, even going as far as to accuse the now-dead guards of moving the castle he was supposed to blow up with a sheep-rocket, when he hit the tower instead. Bullseye told Deadpool that he wouldn't kill him for one reason - he made him laugh. At this point, it was revealed that they had worked together before, in the Army - where Bullseye nearly lost his pinky toe because they were laughing so much on a mission.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 16}}

Hoping to turn over a new leaf, he found that killing was not so easily left behind when, at the behest of the ghosts of his fellow former Weapon X inmates, he killed [[Francis Fanny (Earth-616)|Ajax]]. The former Attendant had been tracking down and killing them all, one by one, mainly wanting to kill Deadpool. This was possible partly due to the help of Dr. Killebrew, who lost his life to Ajax. Before he was remotely-kidnapped by his teleportation belt and Ajax, he told Blind Al that she was now free.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 17|20}}

Deadpool would go on to take Zoe up on her offer and be the "Mithras" that L, L & L wanted him to be. Deadpool was told he must kill an alien being, [[Tiamat (Champion) (Earth-616)|Tiamat]], to protect an alien Messiah. Deadpool wasn't pleased that his role in these events would come down to killing but agreed nevertheless. After defeating Tiamat it became clear that the Messiah was only going to bring peace to the Earth by placing everyone in a mindless bliss. Deadpool spared Tiamat and defeated the Messiah.{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Vol 3 21}}-[[Deadpool Vol 3 25|25]]}}

===Heroes for Hire Again===
After being employed by L, L & L, he was hired to be part of a [[Heroes for Hire (Oracle Inc.) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]] mission, much to the annoyance of [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]], [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]], [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]], and [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]]. When he found that he would have to climb a mountain to their castle destination - and that HFH lacked a flier - he teleported up instead. He was immediately seen at the top, losing the essence of surprise. The HFH attacked, finding an iteration of [[Wild Pack (Earth-616)|Wild Pack]] waiting for them. After the rest of Heroes for Hire were defeated, Deadpool teleported to safety. Later Deadpool located and freed Misty and Colleen from the room they were being held in by [[Madcap (Earth-616)|Madcap]], bringing their weapons to them as well. When asked where he concealed them, he replied with "Do you reeeeally want to know? It involves an awful lot of lubricant." Deadpool and the girls then met up with Luke Cage who turned out to be working toward an alternate agenda. Claiming he could smell a traitor when he saw one, Deadpool opened fire. Cage managed to escape minutes later.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 1 10|11}}

===Continued Mercenary Life===
[[File:Wade Wilson and Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616) from Deadpool Vol 3 28 0002.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Deadpool acknowledges his existence in a comic book.]]
Having lost his optimism toward being able to better himself, Deadpool returned to his mercenary life. Troubled by recent events, he sought the counsel of deranged psychiatrist [[Lester Verde (Earth-616)|Doctor Bong]], who advised him to work out his difficulties in a fight with Wolverine. The fight indeed cleared Deadpool's mind, but his psyche was dealt a stunning blow by the resurrection of [[Mercedes Wilson (Earth-616)|Mercedes Wilson]] whom Deadpool still believed to be his wife. T-Ray revealed himself not only as the one responsible for her resurrection, but also as the "true" Wade Wilson. The revelation did not break Deadpool’s spirit as T-Ray had hoped, for the mercenary still harbored hopes of bettering himself. Swearing vengeance, T-Ray departed with Mercedes Wilson.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 26|33}}

In the course of an assassination assignment against author [[Duncan Vess (Earth-616)|Duncan Vess]], Deadpool again clashed with Wolverine who had sensed something strange about Vess. The pair found themselves battling Vess' vengeful kinsmen after the author was revealed to be a werewolf, and they parted on good terms.{{r|Wolverine Annual Vol 1 1999}} Weeks later, Deadpool would be forced to capture Wolverine in exchange for medical treatment for [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]], who had been injured in a mission with X-Force. Siryn was cured, and Wolverine easily outfought his captors.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 154|155}}

Seeking a new place for himself, Deadpool briefly shared an apartment with fellow mercenaries Titania and the [[Frank Payne (Earth-616)|Constrictor]]. However, Titania proved to be Copycat in disguise, and the apartment was destroyed by the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|The Wizard]] and the [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]], both seeking revenge on Deadpool.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 38|45}} He then established a secret warehouse headquarters and took on a young sidekick who called himself [[Christopher Cassera (Earth-616)|Kid Deadpool (Chris Cassera)]]. Sadly, the youth was also seeking vengeance against Deadpool for his part in Cassera's father's death, and blew up the warehouse.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 50|51}}

===Gemini Star===
Deadpool was tracked down by [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] and invited to join a new Weapon X Program. Impressed by Weapon X’s upgrade to his healing factor, he agreed to join, but soon found the organization's methods to be too bloody, even for him. After the death of Copycat at the hands of Sabretooth, he confronted the [[Malcolm Colcord (Earth-616)|Director]], only to have his healing factor reversed to the point where he again lost physical cohesion and died.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 57|60}}

The lingering effects of Deadpool's healing factor upgrade resurrected him, leaving him an amnesiac. A chance encounter with Weasel later restored his memory, and he discovered that [[Team Deadpool (Earth-616)|four other individuals]] had laid claim to the Deadpool name in his absence. These impostors were aspects of his own personality given form by a device called the Gemini Star, wielded by T-Ray, who had been hired by the intergalactic villain [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]]. Thanos himself was enamored of Death and became jealous of Deadpool’s relationship with her. T-Ray intended to use the Gemini Star to manifest and extinguish every aspect of Deadpool’s personality, leaving him an empty shell; however Deadpool damaged the device, causing his personality fragments to be absorbed into T-Ray and render Ray comatose. With T-Ray out of the way, Deadpool claimed his identity as the true Wade Wilson once again.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 61|64}}

===Agent X===
Following an assignment to kill the [[Four Winds (Deadpool Foes) (Earth-616)|Four Winds]] crime family, Deadpool gained prominent status as a mercenary and formed a company called DP, Inc., aided by business partner [[Sondra Brandenberg (Earth-616)|Sandi Brandenberg]]. His success was short-lived, however, when the [[Black Swan (Earth-616)|Black Swan]], a fellow assassin who had actually slain the Four Winds himself, sought vengeance for Deadpool’s wrongful claim. Both men were believed dead after an explosive confrontation, but the Swan’s telepathic power caused the memories and skills of both himself and Deadpool to merge into the corpse of his underling [[Agent X (Nijo) (Earth-616)|Nijo]]. Deadpool’s healing factor resurrected Nijo, whose mind was created from an amalgam of Deadpool and the Swan. Injured and an amnesiac, Nijo found his way to Sandi’s apartment. Sandi believed Nijo to be Deadpool and nursed him back to health.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 65|69}}{{r|Agent X Vol 1 1}}

The man took the name Alex Hayden and together they started "[[Agency X (Earth-616)|Agency X]]", with Hayden dubbed Agent X after the company. Most believed that Hayden was Deadpool with a case of amnesia. The truth was discovered when the Black Swan showed up with a "tabula rasa" Deadpool in tow, who Hayden immediately shot in the head. Deadpool's own personality was slowly growing back, unwittingly accelerated by Hayden's bullet to his head.{{r|Agent X #7|13}}

{{quote|You and Wilson have my skills, Mr Hayden. In return, I received a taste for Radiohead and an encyclopedic knowledge of pornographic knock-knock jokes. Yes, I'd like to switch back if possible.|[[Black Swan (Earth-616)|Black Swan]]}}

In an attempt to regain the parts of his mind he had lost, as well as remove the pieces of their minds he wanted rid of, Swan proposed a three-way mind meld. Hayden agreed; however the Swan, being an evil cad, attempted to double cross the others and kill them as soon as the process was complete, but while he concentrated on Hayden, Deadpool stabbed him in the back. Deadpool, Hayden and Hayden's allies [[Inez Temple (Earth-616)|Outlaw]] and Taskmaster had the Swan stuffed so that the healing factor couldn't resurrect him. (Hayden would later use the corpse as a surfboard).{{r|{{cl|Agent X Vol 1 13}}-[[Agent X Vol 1 15|15]]}}

===With Cable===
Both Deadpool and Cable became involved with a terrorist plot aimed at unleashing the shape-shifting "Façade Virus" upon the world. Both were infected with the virus, with merging their DNA structures being the only way they could survive. As a result, each man had some of the other's DNA sequences within them. From then on, whenever Cable used his teleporter to "bodyslide", both he and Deadpool teleported together -- sometimes literally (a "bodyslide by one" resulted in them being badly integrated into a single body, forcing a messy separation, which, thanks to the DNA shared with Wade, Cable was also able to recover from). An additional result of the Façade Virus in his system was that Deadpool's skin was temporarily cured of the hideous tumor-scarring. This result was corrected when Cable shut down all infections of the virus worldwide.

[[File:Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Cable & Deadpool]]
Cable was achieving the peak of his abilities, seeking to become a world leader ushering a new era of peace. [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] worried about his son, and hired Wade to find and assemble pieces of a teleporter meant to stop Cable if it came to that. In an attempt to unite the world, Cable deliberately set the world's leaders against him, by threatening to throw their missiles into the sun. Deadpool and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] mounted their attack on [[Providence (Island)|Providence]], whereupon Deadpool promptly turned on the X-Men, siding with Cable. Cable confessed to wanting to become a martyr, to show the governments that they could achieve something by working together.

In an attack by the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]], Cable burnt out his powers and narrowly escaped death when Deadpool removed the telepathic and telekinetic parts of his brain via mini-teleporter. Cable was badly injured, and Wade then set out to recover some techno-organic matter to replace the damage. Deadpool encountered Agent X and the [[Paul Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|Fixer]] during his mission and was ultimately successful, which sadly left him unemployed thereafter. Cable felt guilty for Deadpool's status as a renegade mercenary being corrupted by his heroism, and began to covertly hire him for missions, without revealing that he was the one doing so.

Deadpool would later rescue Cable again, teleporting through several alternate worlds to retrieve him when he became lost.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #15}} Cable returned the favor by repairing Deadpool's brain damage before his powers burnt out once more, leaving his personality and powers unchanged.

===[[Civil War]]===
As the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] came into law, Deadpool decided to try and get hired to be a S.H.I.E.L.D.-licensed bounty hunter, hunting down super-powered individuals to get them to register with [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] His initial attempts were unsuccessful, but he was hired nonetheless, being ordered by the president to hunt Cable. Wade was unsuccessful.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #30|32}}

Trying to fix his again damaged reputation, Deadpool kidnapped Taskmaster and forced him to fight to convince four Government higher-ups (who were also kidnapped) to hire him again. Deadpool won the fight, but wasn't hired, being cited as too immature.{{r|{{cl|Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 35}}-[[Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 36|36]]}}

===Toy Mercenary===
Deadpool awoke days later to find that he had been shrunk with [[Pym Particles]] by Weasel, who was attempting to help Wade take on the [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]]. Deadpool tried, and was instead made into a keychain and taken to the Three Strikes Bar, where he was humiliated repeatedly. After being flushed down a toilet, Deadpool managed to return and beat up each and every one of them, including Rhino - whilst still only a few inches high.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #37}}

Agent X was captured by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], and Deadpool was approached by Agency X to find and rescue him. Still only inches tall, Deadpool went with Weasel to the Hydra base in [[Afghanistan]], where they met [[Bob Dobalina (Earth-616)|Bob, Agent of Hydra]], and used him to free Agent X (who had been turned into a 500 pound slob by Hydra's Morphogenetic Actuator). Deadpool was changed back to normal size in the process and was asked to take over Agency X whilst Nijo got back into shape.

===Leading Agency X===
[[File:Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 12 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Deadpool and Agent X.]]
Returning to Agency X, they found that Outlaw and Sandi had been taken hostage by T-Ray. Deadpool was almost killed when he attempted to save the girls but instead stabbed T-Ray in the head with a katana ("forged by the same guy who made the one on ''Heroes''").{{r|Cable & Deadpool #39}}

===Cable's "Death" & Penetraitor===
Providence was attacked by the [[Hecatomb (Earth-616)|Hecatomb]], and Deadpool came to help. He arrived too late to fight the alien, but was able to help Cable to fight off the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]]. In the end, Deadpool realized Cable wouldn't trust him with important tasks, and was sent home alone while Cable seemingly perished with Providence. Deadpool went to [[Rumekistan]] to pay his final respects to Cable, and while he was there, was asked to stop Wolverine from destroying a Hydra base. Minutes before Wolverine found Weasel at the base, Wade found him in a suit capable of teleportation, calling himself the "Penetraitor". Quickly decapitating Deadpool, Wolverine began to kill the Hydra agents, leaving ones that were strapped into suits similar to the Penetraitor's. They activated the suits to escape, but disappeared. Weasel explained that they were rigged to send the users to [[Guantanamo Bay]], and Bob was able to reattach Deadpool's head. Bob, Weasel, and Wade returned to Rumekistan to finish paying their final respects, when Deadpool and Bob disappeared in a flash of light due to the now damaged suit Weasel wore.{{r|{{cl|Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 40}}-[[Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 44|44]]}}

===Time Travel===
They appeared in [[Europe]], circa [[World War II]], where they encountered [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky]], aiding them in their quest to defeat [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]] and his creations. Time-slips created problems during the trip, and Cap and Bucky once forgot who Bob and Deadpool were, attacking them. The time-slips were created by Weasel's efforts to return them to the present. Eventually two teams of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] were able to return them to the present.{{r|{{cl|Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 45}}-[[Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 46|46]]}}

===Resurrecting T-Ray===
Deadpool went on several missions for [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr Strange]], patching the mystical hole he created in T-Ray's head by stabbing other mystical creatures with the same sword. The final act to seal the rift was to find T-Ray's soul and bring him back to life. Wade reluctantly set out to do so, seeking help from [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Brother Voodoo]] along the way. T-Ray was eventually returned to life, and both realized they needed each other.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #47|48}}

===Savage Land & Dinosaurs===
Upon returning to Agency X headquarters, [[Irene Merryweather (Earth-616)|Irene Merryweather]] came asking for aid in locating an energy generator for Rumekistan which was based in the [[Savage Land]]. When arriving, the team encountered a mind controlled [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]], and had to fight the forces of [[Brainchild (Earth-616)|Brainchild]]. During the conflict, Deadpool accidentally used Weasel's Penetraitor technology to warp some dinosaurs to the [[Latverian Embassy]] in [[New York City|New York]]. So upon defeating Brainchild they had to return to New York to help the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] return the dinosaurs (who happened to be infected with symbiotes at the time). Deadpool saved the day by absorbing the consciousness of the symbiotes and killing himself (albeit briefly).{{r|Cable & Deadpool #49|50}}

===A Trap for Daken===
Despite being hailed as something of a hero after the stunt with the symbiotes, Deadpool slipped easily back into his old ways when attempting to kill Wolverine. For once, Deadpool planned every stage of the attack, orchestrating a series of hits that came close to killing both of them. Just before Wolverine was to be drowned, [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]] interfered, cutting off Wade's hands so that he could kill his father himself. Daken was shot with a carbonadium bullet by Bucky Barnes, who had originally hired Deadpool. The entire hit was planned by Wolverine so that he could capture his son, so Deadpool received no money.{{r|{{cl|Wolverine: Origins Vol 1 20}}-[[Wolverine: Origins Vol 1 25|25]]}}

[[File:Deadpool Vol 4 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Deadpool fighting a Super-Skrull]]
===[[Secret Invasion]]===
Not too long after the Civil War, Deadpool ran into [[Madcap (Earth-616)|Madcap]]. A failed attempt to drive Deadpool insane led to a battle with [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], with the latter electrocuting Deadpool and Madcap to dust. When the combined remains of the pair regenerated, Madcap was absorbed into Deadpool, and went on to live inside Wade's mind, manifesting in the form of an inner voice.{{r|Deadpool Annual Vol 3 1}}

When the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] began, Wade was held captive, and trained [[Skrulls]] to be more unpredictable so as to better handle his abilities. He escaped when the Skrulls turned on one another and transmitted stolen intel files to [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] (Wilson's real plan), which was intercepted by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]], who lead the Avengers and [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] Since Fury never received the data, Wilson went unpaid for his efforts.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 1|3}}

===[[Dark Reign]]===
[[File:Deadpool Vol 4 7 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Deadpool and Bob, Agent of Hydra]]
With no money left after the third unpaid job in a row, Deadpool had to steal away on a freighter bound for America. Mid-Atlantic, the ship was sunk by [[Todd Arliss (Earth-616)|Tiger Shark]] tearing through the hull. He awoke on a beach in [[Mexico]], missing an arm and with his costume in tatters, and planned to kill Tiger Shark while he recovered. Tiger Shark found him first, and tried to kill him with an oversized machete. The resulting fight brought the Mexican police, who shot and seemingly killed Wade while Tiger Shark escaped. He woke up to find himself in a body bag on a pier, which he felt was a nice change from waking up in a body bag in the morgue. Tiger Shark came out the water and attacked again when Bob appeared with his guns blazing. Tiger Shark dives back into the water, and after a couple hours of waiting for him to resurface, Bob and Deadpool retire to a motel. There, Bob reveals that he was sent to kill Deadpool, same as Tiger Shark (who was on his way to the room). Wade managed to shoot Tiger Shark through the motel window and interrogate Bob for the name of his employer, Norman Osborn. Norman was aware that the intel Wade unwillingly provided was the only reason he was put into a position of power, and wanted Deadpool eliminated to secure his position. Wade had no idea who Norman was.{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Vol 4 6}}-[[Deadpool Vol 4 7|7]]}}

Wilson traveled back to New York with the idea that Osborn should have paid him for that intel he transmitted during the Secret Invasion, and attempted to break into the [[Stark Tower|Avengers tower]]. Osborn had been ready for him with a trap, and sent the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] to intercept him. Deadpool managed to disable all of the Thunderbolts with the exception of [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], who he began to fall for. While professing his love, he was shot by [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]] and escaped. He teleported to the Taskmaster's 'Unoccupied office building' where he regrouped and got the bullets out of his body whilst telling "Tasky" about how much he adored Black Widow and his plan for two Deadpools.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 8}}

Hiring a plane to fly a banner professing his love for "BW" as well as his phone number, Taskmaster was able to pinpoint the call made to that number to find the Thunderbolt's headquarters. The Thunderbolts used the call to find Taskmaster's position as well, believing him to be Deadpool. As they left to intercept him, Deadpool called their number and flirted with Widow while he shot at them from the plane. Crashing the plane and losing that phone, he teleported back to Taskmaster to get a new phone before teleporting directly to her, since she wasn't with her team. While fighting and kissing her, he managed to ask Taskmaster (dressed as Deadpool) to stall her team while he spent time with her. After losing Rock-Paper-Scissors, Deadpool had to instead take care of the Thunderbolts while Taskmaster went after Black Widow. Taskmaster was captured by her, and was about to have his head cut off by [[Cleavon Twain (Earth-616)|Headsman]] when Wade rescued him. Osborn wanted to see Deadpool killed, and was in attendance when Taskmaster was about to have his head chopped, so Deadpool went after him after releasing Taskmaster. Wade nearly had Osborn when Black Widow shot him through the heart, enabling Headsman to cut off his head.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 9}}

[[File:Wade Wilson (Earth-616) and Norman Osborn (Earth-616) from Deadpool Vol 4 9 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Deadpool behind Norman Osborn]]After recovering, Deadpool thanked Taskmaster for his help by paying him via ATM using Osborn's wallet. Taskmaster claimed he didn't put Wade's head back on, and Deadpool believed it was Widow's way of telling him she loved him back. He would later pop up behind Osborn during a national television appearance holding a sign that said, "Respawn lol".{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 9}}

Out of work yet again, Wade posted his services on Craigslist. He was hired to kill a pizza boy for making fun of a girl in childhood. Wade managed to shoot him, then stealing all of the homeowner's possessions in the house he had broken into to order the pizza. While checking out the TV, he saw a news story where he was denounced as a traitor to the human race for joining the Skrulls. When he went to get the keys to the car in the garage, he was greeted by Hawkeye (really Bullseye) and was eventually shot in the head with an arrow. Planning to grind him up so that he couldn't regenerate, Lester underestimated Wade's healing factor, and was surprised when Deadpool attacked. When Deadpool won the fight, Bullseye paid him to never tell anyone else.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 10|12}}

Wade used his new-found riches to buy a pirate boat, and as a short and very unsuccessful stint as a pirate, decided to become a hero instead.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 13|14}}

[[File:Wade Wilson (Earth-616) from Deadpool Vol 4 16 001.png|thumb|right|Deadpool... X-Man!]]
He made his way to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] to become an X-Man, and they quickly rejected him. Since they couldn't just let him go, they pretended to bring him in on a probationary membership under the watch of [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]]. Deadpool tried to get in the X-Men's good graces by killing [[Ellis Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mark Kincaid]], who had been claiming that the X-Men had kidnapped [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|his daughter]] and were holding her against her will (part of Norman Osborn's plot to weaken the X-Men). When his plan began to fall apart, Osborn instead tried to use the situation to further discredit the X-Men by killing Kincaid and blaming Deadpool (who had publicly and falsely claimed X-Men membership), but Deadpool had set everything up to make the X-Men heroes again in the eyes of the public. This convinced the X-Men to reluctantly give Wade full membership.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 16|18}}

He seemingly stayed on Utopia, and squatted in [[Alani Ryan (Earth-616)|Loa]]'s quarters during [[Necrosha]]. When Loa was attacked by the [[Fabian Cortez (Earth-616)|Cortez]], [[Marco Delgado (Earth-616)|Delgado]], and [[Seamus Mellencamp (Earth-616)|Mellencamp]], who were searching [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] to kill him, Wade first intended to team-up with them, unknowing that Magneto was now an X-Man but was soon asked by [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] to battle them, without killing. He quickly realized (in disobeying) that wouldn't be a problem as the [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]] were regenerated by the [[Techno-Organic Virus|T-O virus]]. Severely beat up, he was saved by Loa, whose powers were revealed to be fatal to the returned, so Deadpool used her as a projectile against them.{{r|X-Force Annual Vol 3 1}}

[[File:Prelude to Deadpool Corps Vol 1 1 Textless McGuinness Variant.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Move along Green Lantern, here's the Deadpool Corps]]
===Deadpool Corps===
Deadpool was recruited by an entity known as the [[Tath Ki (Earth-616)|Contemplator]] to save the [[Multiverse]]. To do this he would have to assemble a team of alternate universe Deadpools. He visited a string of universes where his alternates were significantly different from him, recruiting [[Wanda Wilson (Earth-3010)|Lady Deadpool]], [[Wade Wilson (Earth-10330)|Kidpool]], [[Wade Wilson (Earth-103173)|Dogpool]], and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-2149)|Headpool]] along the way. With his team assembled, he revealed his plan to save the multiverse to them.{{r|{{cl|Prelude to Deadpool Corps Vol 1 1}}-[[Prelude to Deadpool Corps Vol 1 5|5]]}}{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Corps Vol 1 1}}-[[Deadpool Corps Vol 1 6|6]]}}

===X-Force===
Deadpool joined Wolverine and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]]'s [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|Black Ops X-Force]] team to proactively eliminate threats to the mutant race with the only rule being that no one, not even the X-Men, could ever know that they exist.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming #2}} After one of their first missions, which ended with the team killing [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]], who was reincarnated as an innocent child, Deadpool called a meeting to discuss his moral doubts about killing a child. During this meeting, Archangel told Wolverine that, despite being employed by Archangel for over a year, Deadpool never cashed any of the checks for his services.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #5}} Later, in the [[Deathlok Prime (Earth-10511)|Deathlok]] team-up, X-Force was taken into [[The World]] to look for the origin of the mind-controlled army. There was also some bad tension between Deadpool and [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]], which leads to them going different ways. Deadpool ends up being the one to kill The World's [[Father (Earth-616)|Father]] by cutting his head off then putting a sword through it to show the rest of the team. Fantomex is surprised, and they leave in silence.

===[[Fear Itself]]===
During the invasion of the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]] and his [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]], Deadpool attempted to cash in on the fear that was running rampant throughout the world. To this end, he stole a magic hammer belonging to a pair of werewolf hunters, and then gave it to the dimwitted [[Hubert Carpenter (Earth-616)|Walrus]], convincing the hapless Mort that he'd been chosen to serve as one of the Worthy. His plan was to send the Walrus rampaging through the town of Cimarron, [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]], and then show up and "rescue" the town and collect a hefty fee. The hammer, however, proved to have the ability to negate Deadpool's healing factor during a full moon, and what should have been an easy fight proved nearly fatal. Initially, he tried to run away, but was confronted by the werewolf hunters, who informed him that the hammer was needed to stop an impending attack by a pack of werewolves. Convinced of the necessity of retrieving the hammer, Deadpool returned to town, and tricked the Walrus into entering the sheriff's office, thus taking it out of the light of the full moon and deactivating its powers. He then promptly shot the Walrus in the shoulder, took back the hammer, and effectively saved the town, though he found to his dismay that the town's cache of Confederate gold had long ago been stolen, and thus they could not pay him for his efforts.{{r|{{cl|Fear Itself: Deadpool Vol 1 1}}-[[Fear Itself: Deadpool Vol 1 3|3]]}}

===The Best There Is===
After defeating the intergalactic mercenary, [[Macho Gomez (Earth-616)|Macho Gomez]], Deadpool went on a space odyssey where he saved two civilizations (the [[Urrulians]], and the remains of the [[Ongulians]]) and killed [[Id (Selfish Moon) (Earth-616)|Id, the Selfish Moon]] of [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego]]. After coming back to Earth, he fought the vengeful Blind Al, Weasel, Taskmaster, [[Ashley Crawford (Earth-616)|Big Bertha]], and Sluggo, under the leadership of Macho. After a drawn out fight and killing Sluggo, Wade paused and asked his so-thought friends "Is this what you want?!" After which they proceeded to shoot him until he lost consciousness. Thanks to his healing factor, Deadpool recovered. After talking with Bob about how he treats his friends, Wade realized what he truly wanted was to die.{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Vol 4 32}}-[[Deadpool Vol 4 36|36]]}}

===Institutionalized===
[[File:Wade Wilson (Earth-616) from Deadpool Vol 4 42 001.jpg|thumb|right|Deadpool in Crossmore.]]
After unsuccessfully committing suicide, surviving atomic bombs, and battling the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], Wade was sent to the English prison of [[Crossmore Prison|Crossmore]], where he met doctor [[Ellen Whitby (Earth-616)|Ellen Whitby]], who had been secretly obsessed with him for several years. Out of a one-sided love, she helped him escape. Despite this, Wade rejected her for her creepy infatuation with him. After leaving he encountered the local law enforcement which inadvertently led to Wade taking the [[Elizabeth Windsor II (Earth-616)|Queen of England]] hostage. After having a talk with the Queen, she convinced Deadpool that Whitby was his responsibility. After going to her apartment, he found many of his own severed body parts in the fridge. After confronting Whitby she killed herself, and Wade threw the frozen body parts in a dumpster and left. Afterward, the parts thawed and healed together to form an even more deformed and very sadistic clone of [[Evil Deadpool (Earth-616)|Deadpool]].{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Vol 4 37}}-[[Deadpool Vol 4 44|44]]}}

Both Deadpools managed to get to [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]] on their own. Wade met Evil Deadpool at his favorite chimichanga restaurant, which Evil Deadpool blew up. After a long fight and running out of bullets, the Deadpools agreed to meet and fight at [[Canarsie Park]]. After another fight and another explosion, Evil Deadpool escaped while Wade was confronted by Captain America.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 46}} Meanwhile, Evil Deadpool approached [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mister Negative]] to ask him for a job (murdering a police chief's children). After careful contemplation of Evil Deadpool's next move, Wade decided that his clone's motivation must be to one-up the original Deadpool. After some planning, Wade proceeded to publicly kidnap a random child in hope that this would draw out Evil Deadpool.{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Vol 4 45}}-[[Deadpool Vol 4 46|46]]}}

However, Evil Deadpool had already predicted this and kidnapped the police chief's children and sent a message to the parents that he had done so (leading to the chief to believe the real Deadpool had kidnapped his children), and then took out Captain America who had been watching Wade (and knew that Wade was never anywhere near those children). After Cap recovered and [[International Criminal Police Organization (Earth-616)|Interpol]] became involved, Cap informed the chief that Deadpool couldn't have kidnapped his children and so all were led to believe he had an accomplice. After some time passed, Wade realized that he had been played, freed the child and escaped. Using a teleportation device, Evil Deadpool lured the police chief and Deadpool into a trap to make it appear that Deadpool had killed the chief and his children, this failed however and the chief escaped with his children. Evil Deadpool then explained to Wade that his motivations were to show him that no matter what good he accomplishes people would only ever see him as a monster.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 47|49}}

Just then, Captain America and the police arrived at the scene and told both to stand down. Evil Deadpool raised his weapon at them and was shot down in a hail of bullets. After he was down, it is seen that he was hit with a special dart that none of the police claim to have fired, and all of Evil Deadpool's scars fade until he appears a regular human and dies. After witnessing that there was a way to kill him, Wade stole Evil Deadpool's teleportation device and escaped.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 49}}

===Search for Death and Powerlessness===
[[File:Wade Wilson (Earth-616) from Deadpool Vol 4 54 001.jpg|thumb|Wade Wilson is cured.]]
Wilson started a plan to get the serum used to neutralize Evil Deadpool's healing factor, so he could finally be with his beloved Death. With the help of Bob, he manipulated X-Force, the Kingpin and the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]], Daken, and [[Lonnie Lincoln (Earth-616)|Tombstone]] (who had the serum made in the beginning). Deadpool pitted X-Force against [[Mary Walker (Earth-616)|Typhoid Mary]] and the Hand (believing Kingpin was in possession of the serum). Meanwhile Daken stole a sample of the serum from Tombstone which he later used to shoot Wolverine.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 50|52}}

In the midst of the chaos, Deadpool was injected with another sample of the serum by Bob (which he got from Tombstone after conspiring with him against Wade), who was then angered after finding out that Wade had planned for this all along. Wade then went to X-Force to learn that the serum was made specifically for his DNA, and thus had no effect on Wolverine. After learning that everything was planned by Wade, X-Force too was angered and decided to kill Wade after he had escaped from them. After fighting and escaping from Tombstone, Wade was confronted by an angry Bob. After this (and seeing that his deformities were cured by the serum) Wade resolved not to die. Later, the two confronted X-Force. After making amends, they let Wade leave to help the injured Bob.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 53|54}}

After he lost his healing factor, Wilson claimed he felt "more alive than ever." However, after a harsh beating from [[Intelligencia (Earth-616)|Intelligencia]], Wade realized that he had let his ability to heal compensate for skill so he decided to ask for help with Taskmaster in training. Taskmaster asked Wilson to help him steal Pym Particles from S.H.I.E.L.D., but left Wade to die even knowing his healing factor was gone. Taskmaster also sold the knowledge to one of Wade's old enemies, the [[Garabed Bashur (Earth-616)|Black Box]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 55|57}}

Wade managed to defeat the villains recruited by Black Box, Black Tom, and Black Swan, but in the process his face was burned and disfigured again. Former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|FBI]] agent [[Allison Kemp (Earth-616)|Allison Kemp]] wanted to get revenge on Deadpool because of his involvement in an accident which left her in a wheelchair, and she called other nemeses of Deadpool such as T-Ray and Slayback and trained them in order to kill the merc. Deadpool infiltrated their base and managed to get T-Ray and Slayback killed. When Kemp was about to kill herself in a explosion, which would also kill Wade in the process, he convinced her not to. In that moment, he was surprised by the returned Evil Deadpool, who informed Wade that the serum they took was not permanent, the reason why Wade's face didn't heal or a finger he lost grew back, so Wade would return after Evil Deadpool shot him.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 58|63}}

===Deadpool vs. Thanos===
Thanos had long been angry at Deadpool for being the object of Lady Death's affections and, unknown to the mercenary, had cursed him with the inability to be killed, thereby preventing Wade from ever uniting with her. When Lady Death went missing, causing all creatures in the universe to become immortal, Deadpool accused Thanos of responsibility, stole a starship from Cable and confronted him. Thanos rescinded his curse, turning Wade into the only mortal creature in the universe and killed him for his impudence. However, Thanos soon realised that Wade was now the only being who could communicate with Death and was forced to bring him back to life so that they could find her.{{r|Deadpool vs. Thanos #1}} Together, they learned that [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]] had taken Lady Death and entered its realm to rescue her. This was Death's plan all along though - to push Thanos to destroy Eternity on her behalf, thereby causing the death of reality. To stop this from occurring, Deadpool was briefly gifted with the [[Glossary:Enigma Force#The Uni-Power|Uni-Power]], turning him into [[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]], thereby giving him the means to defeat Thanos. During the fight, Wade managed to convince Death of the validity of life and to abandon her murderous plans.{{r|Deadpool vs. Thanos #4}}

===The Good, the Bad and the Ugly===
After having Madcap separated from the rest of his body in a situation similar to when they had been merged,{{r|Deadpool Annual Vol 3 1}} Deadpool was hired by S.H.I.E.L.D. to destroy an army of magically-resurrected zombie presidents.{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Vol 5 1}}-[[Deadpool Vol 5 5|5]]}} In the end, the magician who unintentionally caused the zombie attack, [[Michael Hawthorne (Necromancer) (Earth-616)|Michael Hawthorne]], transferred the mind of S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Emily Preston (Earth-616)|Emily Preston]] into a portion of Deadpool's brain in order to prevent her death.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 6}}

Later, Deadpool was abducted to North Korea by the Butler.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 15}} The Butler revealed to Wade their shared past, and also that he had taken Deadpool's lost daughter, Eleanor, prisoner after Wade quit his program.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 19}} With the help of Preston's consciousness, Captain America, and Wolverine, Deadpool managed to free all the prisoners from the North Korean camp, as he also killed the Butler. Although his daughter could be alive, Deadpool decided not to try to reach her, in order to prevent himself from ruining her life.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 19}}

===Engaged===
Shortly after placing Preston's consciousness into a [[Life-Model Decoy|LMD]] modeled after her, Deadpool was hired by [[Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]] to deliver his future bride to him while fighting various demonic creatures.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 24}} This bride was [[Shiklah (Earth-616)|Shiklah]], the evil queen of the undead. Though the two fought, they eventually got engaged, effectively stealing Dracula's bride, and later married.{{r|Deadpool: The Gauntlet Infinite Comic #4}}{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 27}} Shortly afterwards, Deadpool managed to track down and reunite with his lost daughter Ellie Camacho.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 33}}

===Vs. Carnage===
Inspired by his medium awareness to hunt down the serial killer [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]], Deadpool attacked Cletus Kasady and managed to subdue him with dubstep.{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 1}} Temporarily incapacitated by [[Frances Barrison (Earth-616)|Shriek]], Deadpool regenerated and attacked them again,{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 2}} tracking Carnage down to [[Mercury Team (Earth-616)|Mercury Team]]'s base.<!--{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 3}}-->

Dismembered by Carnage, Deadpool bonded with the [[Phage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Phage]], [[Riot (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Riot]], [[Lasher (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Lasher]], and [[Agony (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Agony]] symbiotes;{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 3}} using them to subdue Carnage by convincing him that his life was being controlled by outside forces. Deadpool then passed the amalgamated symbiote on to Mercury Team's [[Lasher (War Dog) (Earth-616)|German Shepherd war-dog]] before departing.{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 4}}

[[File:Wade Wilson (Earth-616) from Deadpool Vol 5 36 001.jpg|thumb|left|As Zenpool]]
===AXIS===
As part of his plan to stop the recently-unleashed [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Onslaught]], Magneto recruited Deadpool into an army of super-villains to help the heroes fight the Onslaught in [[Genosha]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 36}} This team successfully turned the tide of the battle against the Red Onslaught and his [[Stark Sentinel]] in favor of the heroes, and allowed the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] and [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] to cast an inversion spell to alter the axis of the Onslaught's brain.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #3}}

However, the spell affected all those present in the island, including Deadpool, who had his pacifist personality take control of his mind and body, and become the Zenpool.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 36}} When Wade discovered [[Evan Sabahnur (Earth-616)|Evan Sabahnur]] had become Apocalypse and was planning on detonating a gene bomb to kill everyone who wasn't a mutant on the planet, Wade tried to convince him into becoming good again, and also helped the [[Astonishing Avengers (Earth-616)|Astonishing Avengers]] stop the inverted X-Men.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #7}} After much effort, Wade managed to convince Apocalypse into helping him prevent the [[Axis (Avengers) (Earth-616)|Axis]] from killing the White Skull (the inverted counterpart of the Red Skull). After Doctor Doom and the Scarlet Witch managed to cast a reinversion spell, Wade returned to his Deadpool persona.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #9}} However, as an after effect of the reinversion spell, Wade regained his conscience.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 41}}

===Time Runs Out===
In retaliation for destroying their [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier|Helicarrier]] and slaughtering countless agents, [[Underground Liberated Totally Integrated Mobile Army To Unite Mankind (Earth-616)|U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.]] tried to have revenge by killing Deadpool's family and friends.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 23}} After their attempt failed, Wade put together a plan to deal with U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. once and for all, successfully retaliating and murdering all of U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.'s agents. Subsequently, Wade decided to give up his life as Deadpool. As he was celebrating the start of a new life with his friends and family, an [[Glossary:Incursion|incursion]] between [[Earth-616]] and the [[Earth-1610]] caused the collision and destruction of both universe's planets Earth, with Deadpool and his allies dying in the process.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 45}}

===Mercs for Money===
When the universe came back to life, so did Wade and the rest of its inhabitants, with no memory of their temporary demise. In the course of the following months, Deadpool's popularity skyrocketed after the mercenary [[James Bourne (Earth-616)|Solo]] impersonated him to piggyback on Deadpool's reputation and take jobs at a higher pay rate. One of Solo's jobs in [[Washington, D.C.]] had Deadpool's public opinion drastically change for the better{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 7}} when he saved an ambassador from his telepathically-manipulated agents.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 16}} After learning of Solo's impersonation, Deadpool came up with the idea to form a group of mercenaries called the [[Mercs for Money (Earth-616)|Mercs for Money]] to extend his reach across the globe. However, Deadpool's newfound popularity forced him to leave his family behind, fearing his enemies could endanger them. Deadpool additionally joined the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]] and used his popularity as a means of funding the team, profiting from merchandise.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 1}}

[[File:Deadpool & the Mercs for Money Vol 2 4 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mercs for Money]]
Madcap additionally returned to Deadpool's life, though Wade was unaware his experience trapped inside his mind had left Madcap emotionally damaged and vengeful.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 4}} Madcap initially posed as an ally, joining the Mercs for Money,{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 1}} but eventually showed his true intentions after he was discovered impersonating Deadpool to defame and threaten his loved ones. Seeing as he had had enough fun, Madcap used an alien weapon to disintegrate himself on the molecular level.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 5}} For his second coming, the villain had Deadpool unwittingly become the carrier of a deadly airborne virus with which he infected his family.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 23}} Wade fortunately found a cure, though had to resort to Cable's evil clone [[Nathaniel Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]] to find it.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 24}} Around this time, tensions between Shiklah's domain and the surface word sparked an invasion of Manhattan from Monster Metropolis,{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 28}} which in turn led to Shiklah divorcing Deadpool, opting to return to Dracula instead.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 29}}

===Deadpool the Duck===
After [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]] was infected with [[Robotic Antibody/Bacterial Infection Engines|Space Rabies]], S.H.I.E.L.D. hired Deadpool to deal with him. Deadpool predicted where Rocket would crashfall and found him arguing with [[Howard Duckson (Earth-791021)|Howard the Duck]]. Not thinking straight Rocket bit Deadpool's teleporter breaking it and causing Deadpool to merge with Howard to become [[Deadpool the Duck (Earth-616)|Deadpool the Duck]].{{r|Deadpool the Duck Vol 1 1}} After vomiting for a time, the two realized that only one could control their merged body at a time, while the other remained in the [[Negative Zone]]. Investigating Rocket's space rabies, Deadpool The Duck used Rocket's ship's "emergency return" button to retrace Rocket's journey, arriving at a science-lab satellite owned by the Roxxon Corporation. After exploding the satellite, Deadpool the Duck arrived at a secret Roxxon Corporation island.{{r|Deadpool the Duck Vol 1 2}} Deadpool the Duck soon discovered that their fusion wasn't the result of the teleporter, but rather the nanomachines that were the space rabies infecting Rocket Raccoon. He had been foaming at the mouth because his saliva was teeming with nanomachines, which merged Deadpool with Rocket on a molecular level.{{r|Deadpool the Duck Vol 1 3}}

After discovering the original R.A.B.I.E.s machine on Roxxon's island, Deadpool the Duck placed Rocket into the R.A.B.I.E.s machine to remove the nanites, just as the firefight between Roxxon and S.H.I.E.L.D. began. While the R.A.B.I.E.s machine was destroyed in the brawl, plenty of nanobots remained in Deadpool the Duck after the vomiting sequence. If they were to ingest the nanomachines, then Deadpool and Howard could separate themselves from each other. After swallowing a some of their own discharge, Deadpool the Duck still remained, as both heroes must assist in the separation. Then, [[Lester Verde (Earth-616)|Doctor Bong]] arrived, revealing that he had been the mastermind behind all of this. The villain had been trying to create a hybrid animal army by infecting Rocket with nanomachines to serve as a rabid carrier, and intentionally sent the infected Rocket after Howard, intending for him to be the first convert in Bong's hybrid army.{{r|Deadpool the Duck Vol 1 4}} While Doctor Bong's bell-shaped helmet released a paralyzing shockwave when struck, this didn't stop Deadpool the Duck from hitting Doctor Bong repeatedly, since Deadpool's nerves didn't work. Taking advantage of Doctor Bong's helmet controls of "one hit for paralyzing shockwave, four hits for teleportation", Deadpool The Duck put Dr. Bong's hybrid theory to the test, wailing on him with multiples of four to banish him away. After ripping Bong apart, Deadpool and Howard finally unmerged to find themselves laying in a pool of their own vomit, the two then went their separate ways.{{r|Deadpool the Duck Vol 1 5}}

===Despicable Deadpool===
Not long after Wade joined the Avengers Unity Division, the real Steve Rogers was secretly supplanted by an evil fascist counterpart from another timeline that operated as a [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] sleeper within the superhero community.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 2}} When [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-616)|Phil Coulson]] became suspicious of Cap, Rogers convinced Deadpool to kill him, claiming that Coulson had gone rogue.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 31}} A short time afterwards, Captain America's machinations resulted in Hydra rising to power, taking over the United States of America.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} When Hydra's conquest had barely begun, Preston found out about Coulson's death, and confronted Deadpool about it. The fight ended in Preston's temporary death.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 34}}

As Hydra's empire grew stronger, Wade joined its own version of the [[Avengers (Hydra) (Earth-616)|Avengers]] out of blind loyalty for Captain America.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} Plagued by guilt, Wade held back when tasked with hunting down the rebel alliance known as the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]],{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 32}} and eventually helped, behind the scenes, to lay part of the foundation of Hydra's eventual defeat.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 35}} With his mistakes costing the lives of two of his friends, the love of his daughter, and any respect the world had for him, Deadpool turned his back on what little remained of the life he had built.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 36}} Shortly afterwards, Stryfe demanded Deadpool to kill four people in exchange for having saved his family's life.{{r|Despicable Deadpool Vol 1 287}} Wade managed to trick him and spare two of his would-be victims, Cable and Genesis.{{r|Despicable Deadpool Vol 1 291}}{{r|Despicable Deadpool Vol 1 295}}

Believing that he only brought tragedy to those close to him and that it was impossible for him to get a happy ending,{{r|Despicable Deadpool Vol 1 300}} Deadpool put a bounty on his own head to rid the world of himself,{{r|Despicable Deadpool Vol 1 297}} but no villain managed to defeat him.{{r|Despicable Deadpool Vol 1 298}} After the superhero community also failed to bring him in,{{r|Despicable Deadpool Vol 1 299}} Wade travelled to one of Butler's old hideouts, and dosed himself with an absurd amount of his mind-wiping drug. As a result, he lost all memories of his adventures after [[Deadpool Vol 4 60|his confrontation]] with Black Box, Black Tom, and Black Swan.{{r|Despicable Deadpool Vol 1 300}} With no memories of his most recent adventures, Wade returned to the mercenary business, working with his former teammate from the Mercs for Money, [[Ellie Phimister (Earth-616)|Negasonic Teenage Warhead]], as his assistant.{{r|Deadpool Vol 7 1}}

===King of the Monsters===
After Deadpool was hired to kill the [[Monster King (Earth-616)|Monster King]] who had invaded [[Staten Island]], he teamed up with [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]] in order to accomplish this task, and upon succeeding he became the new king of the monsters, in accordance with an old Monster Law.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 1}}

After giving hospitality to the [[Strikeforce (Earth-616)|Strikeforce]],{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 7}} his first goal as their king was for monsters to live in peace alongside humans, but, after Captain America told Wade that he needed take the monsters out of the island in order to avoid casualties, Deadpool refused and instead declared "war" between humans and monsters.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 2}}

He was then ambushed by [[Last Son of Kraven (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]], who sought to hunt a worthy prey. Elsa, seeing him being overwhelmed by the hunter, shot Deadpool with a bullet that temporarily transported him to a pocket dimension, thus making Kraven flee the scene and allowing Deadpool and the other Monsters to come up with a strategy.{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Vol 8 2}}-[[Deadpool Vol 8 4|4]]}}

After Kraven's defeat, Wade was worried he wouldn't make a good king, considering people had already died under his watch, but Elsa confessed to Deadpool that she believed he could indeed make some good in that position and, after some initial resistance on Wade's side, Elsa even began assisting Deadpool during his reign.{{r|{{cl|Deadpool Vol 8 4}}-[[Deadpool Vol 8 6|6]]}}

After she informed Deadpool that she was dying, the duo went to [[Greenland]], where she explained to him that her bloodstone had been infected by some creatures called the [[Bone Beasts (Race)|Bone Beast]], causing her to slowly begin dying. There, they battled some of the creatures invading a village, but discovered the Bone Beasts had already taken the children. They then entered a portal in the sky and arrived at the Bone Beasts' dimension, where the [[Bone Beast Queen (Earth-616)|Bone Beast Queen]] awaited intending to make Deadpool her new host.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 7}}
[[File:Wade Wilson (Earth-616) from Deadpool Vol 8 8 001.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Powered by the Bloodstone]]

Despite feeling betrayed by Elsa, who he had started developing feelings for, Deadpool fought to escape and save the children, but when she collapsed due to her infection, he removed the bloodstone from her hand and placed it on himself. He fought the Queen while Elsa took the children through the portal back home and, once they were all safe, he blew himself up. After, Elsa came back to check on him, she found his detached head on the floor next to her infection-free bloodstone. After taking it back, she shot a powerful beam from her hand and defeated the Queen, who was still alive, once and for all. After this, Elsa took Deadpool's head to look after him while he regenerated.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 8|9}}

| Personality             = Deadpool is very comedic, although this appears to be caused in part by his mental illness. He is quick to act without thinking and is very impulsive. Deadpool used to present a morally grey personality, with no problem of disregarding other people. However, as an after effect of the [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|inversion spell]], Wade regained his conscience, to the point of even feeling bad for somebody being verbally abused.{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 41}}

Deadpool has friends, such as [[Jack Hammer (Earth-616)|Weasel]] and [[Blind Al (Althea) (Earth-616)|Blind Al]], that he was loyal to and cared about. Due to his variety of mental problems, he would mistreat them at times, such as stabbing Weasel in the leg over the last Cheesy Puff or confining Blind Al in a room filled with sharp objects.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 15}}{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 14}}

Deadpool commonly develops obsessions with words and people, repeatedly mentioning the words ''duodenum'' and ''{{WP|chimichanga}}'', the phrase "Sphincter says what?", and is frequently preoccupied by thoughts of [[Bernice Frankel (Earth-616)|Bea Arthur]] and the Olsen Twins.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #20}}{{r|Cable & Deadpool #1}}

| Powers                  = '''Genetically Enhanced Physiology:''' Deadpool's powers come from the experimentation he was submitted to by the Weapon X program.
* '''[[Healing Factor]]:''' Deadpool possesses a superhuman healing factor derived from that of the mutant Wolverine which allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed bodily tissue with far greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human.{{r|Deadpool Corps: Rank and Foul Vol 1 1}} His head or any other limb can be reattached using this ability.{{r|Thunderbolts #131}} While beheaded, Deadpool can still move his body normally.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 9}} In small doses, Deadpool's blood has demonstrated the ability to heal others{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 21}} and extend their lifespans beyond their natural limits{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 29}}. When combined with [[Artificial Universal-Donor Stem Cells|Star Cells]] injected intravenously, it confers immortality.{{r|Black Panther vs. Deadpool Vol 1 5}}
** '''Foreign Chemical Resistance:''' Deadpool's body is highly resistant to poisons and most drugs.{{r|Deadpool Corps: Rank and Foul Vol 1 1}} For example, it is extremely difficult, though not impossible, for him to become intoxicated (Blind Al made several references to Deadpool being hung-over since he once drunkenly spoke to the Teletubbies on the TV he was watching). He can, momentarily, be affected by certain drugs (tranquilizers) if exposed to a large enough dosage.
** '''Disease Immunity:''' The unique regenerative qualities of Deadpool's healing factor also extend to his immune system; he is immune to all diseases, infections, disorders, imperfection, and resistant to elemental extremes.{{r|Deadpool Corps: Rank and Foul Vol 1 1}}
** '''Immortality:''' Deadpool's healing factor provides him with an endless lifespan by halting the aging process. His life span is extended to such a degree that [[Wade Wilson (Earth-80521)|an alternate reality version of him]] was alive and still in business as Deadpool 800 years in the future.{{r|X-Force / Cable: Messiah War #1}} He was also cursed with immortality by T-Ray on behalf of Thanos, in order to keep him away from [[Death]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 64}}
** '''Telepathic Immunity:''' The healing factor causes his brain to be in a constant state of flux and regeneration, rendering him immune to psychics such as [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], and the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Onslaught]].{{r|Cable & Deadpool #8}}{{r|Deadpool Vol 5 37}} Deadpool can be looped into a telepathic psi-link to communicate with others mentally, as he did while a member of X-Force, but actually reading his mind can be confusing, even to an accomplished telepath like [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 50}} This would not prevent him from being attacked psychically though.
** '''Possession Resistance:''' Similar to the telepathic immunity, Deadpool is able to remain in control of himself while supernatural beings are trying to take control of him. During Xaphan's attempt to take control of him, Wade was able to fight for control of his body. No one can touch his soul.{{r|Deadpool Team-Up Vol 2 897}}
* '''[[Superhuman Strength]]:''' Deadpool is rated as having a low degree of superhuman strength allowing him to lift 800 pounds.{{r|Deadpool Corps: Rank and Foul #1}}
* '''Peak Human Speed:''' Deadpool can run as fast as a trained athlete.{{r|Deadpool Corps: Rank and Foul #1}}
* '''[[Superhuman Stamina]]:''' Deadpool's musculature generates considerably less fatigue toxins than the muscles of an ordinary human being, granting him superhuman levels of stamina in all physical activities. He can physically exert himself at peak capacity for several days before fatigue takes over.
* '''[[Superhuman Agility]]:''' Deadpool's agility, flexibility, dexterity, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.
* '''[[Superhuman Reflexes]]:''' His reflexes are far superior to those of even the finest human athlete. His auto-reflexes allow him to easily dodge gunfire and attacks even when not consciously aware of them.
* '''[[Superhuman Durability]]:''' Deadpool's bone and muscle tissues are augmented to levels that are considerably stronger and harder than human and the tissues are impervious to injury to an extraordinary extent. He possesses golden-proportioned body, and even without training his muscles are brawny and his body shape doesn't change no matter how many calories he intakes.

'''[[Techno-Organic Virus|Cybernetic Arm]]:''' After Deadpool cut Cable's cybernetic arm from his Techno-Organic body and equipped it, it granted Deadpool following powers:
* '''Enhanced Strength:''' With Cable's completely metallic arm arm, Deadpool was capable of curl and dead-lift several tons, without assistance from his right arm.
}}
| Abilities               = '''[[Master Martial Artist]]:''' Deadpool is an extraordinary martial artist, hand-to-hand combatant, and is a master in multiple unarmed combat techniques, including Savate.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 #1}} He has been shown fighting such amazingly skilled fighters as Wolverine and Taskmaster and even defeating them in hand to hand combat.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 3}} This shows that Deadpool himself is among one of the most skilled fighters in the Marvel universe, although in some fights it has been attributed to him being unpredictable.

'''Master Assassin:''' He is a master of assassination techniques, espionage methods, covert operations, infiltration methods, escape artistry, marksmanship, and is highly skilled with many bladed weapons (frequently carrying two swords strapped to his back) and a number of other weapons including firearms.

'''[[Multilingual]]:''' In addition to English, Wade is fluent in Esperanto,{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 16}} German,{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 18}} Japanese,{{r|Deadpool Team-Up Vol 1 1}} and Spanish.{{r|Deadpool Corps: Rank and Foul #1}}

[[File:Wade Wilson (Earth-616) and Neena Thurman (Earth-616) from Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 28 001.jpg|left|thumb]]
'''Medium Awareness:''' After accidentally being transported to the [[Beyond-Realm|Foundation of Reality]] by the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]],{{r|Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars Vol 1 4}} Deadpool became consciously aware that he is a fictional comic book character - though he noted he had always known subconsciously - allowing him to break the [[fourth wall]]. Wade doesn't possess this ability at all times due to the constant changes in his brain. References to the fourth wall made by those with similar abilities to him can trigger his medium awareness.{{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 13}}

'''Unpredictability:''' It is difficult for anyone to know what Deadpool will do at any given moment, given that he himself barely knows what he'll do at any given moment. This makes it difficult for most opponents to predict what he will do. [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]], whose abilities allowed him to analyze and copy the mercenary's fighting style, once believed Deadpool always dodged to the left. Deadpool proved him wrong, however, by completely changing his fighting style on a whim, throwing off Taskmaster's abilities.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 2}}

| Weaknesses              = '''Mental State:''' His healing abilities render his brain unreadable to telepaths, but its constant healing also makes him highly unstable and prone to violent outbursts without the slightest provocation, at least against those he knows could handle. Even with his healing factor, Deadpool can still feel pain from damage taken, although he has a notably high pain tolerance. While it has been shown that Deadpool's condition may not be the source of his instability, it only makes it worse. In several flashbacks to his childhood, he has shown signs of instability.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 11}}{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 60}}

'''Annoyance:''' Wade's incessant talking has also proven to make him a very irritating person to be around. Many heroes often find themselves at wits' end around him; this makes for poor ability to cooperate with him in team efforts. [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] once said that Deadpool's most lethal weapon is his mouth. He will blabber nonsense during the whole fight, distracting and maiming the opponent until the latter "surrenders or commits suicide."{{r|X-Force #2}}

'''[[Glossary:Cancer|Cure for Cancer]]:''' Wade's healing factor was specifically designed to replace his bodies cells as fast as they were being destroyed by his illness. Should his cancer be cured then his healing factor would be rapidly producing redundant new cells, which, if left unchecked, would cause horrible growths over the body and would eventually explode, as demonstrated on the Super Skrulls with Deadpool's powers.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 3}}

'''[[Phobias]]:''' Deadpool has bovinophobia, which is the fear of cows. According to him, cows "scare the *#$% outta me", as he believes their stare to be chilling, like they're "waiting".{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 17}} He may also be scared of chickens, like Domino. This may also have been an attempt to find common ground with her, as he was later able to put one in her path to stop her.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 17}} During Deadpool's adventure to save the multiverse from the [[Awareness (Earth-616)|Awareness]], it was revealed that his worst fear is to be truly and utterly alone.{{r|Deadpool Corps #5}}

'''[[Glossary:Curse|Mystical Curse]]:''' Deadpool was cursed for a short time by [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]], who claimed to be his father.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 36}} The curse made him look like Tom Cruise, rendered his face totally invulnerable, and caused his life to "fall to ruin." The curse was removed when Deadpool reconciled with his true father, who he met in a bar without ever realizing who it was.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 45}} This seems to contradict an issue of "Cable & Deadpool" when, in a conversation between Cable and Deadpool about their pasts and parents, Deadpool's father is shown dying when he was a teenager, however when questioned on the truth of the story by Cable, Deadpool responds, "I'll tell you the truth when you tell me."{{r|Cable & Deadpool #19}}

| Equipment               = ''' [[Deadpool's Suit]]:''' Deadpool wears a full body tactical suit.{{r|Deadpool: The Circle Chase #3}}

'''[[Image Inducer]]:''' Deadpool had access to an holographic image inducer that he can use to disguise his true appearance as necessary.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 1}}

'''[[Bloodgem|Bloodstone]]:''' during the fight against the [[Hive (Bone Beasts) (Earth-616)|Bone Beasts Hive]] who had cursed Elsa's Bloodstone which began infecting, Deadpool removed the stone from Elsa as she was succumbing to it and put it on himself, granting powers, but also infecting as his healing factor was unable to fight it.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 7|8}}

'''[[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Black Symbiotic Costume]]:''' Deadpool was part of the [[Secret Wars (1984 Event)|Secret Wars]] and temporarily bounded with the Venom Symbiote before [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] did. However, fearing his insanity would affect it, he made the symbiote return inside the machine it escaped before Spider-Man entering the room.{{r|Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars Vol 1 3}} Sometime later, after Spider-Man got rid of it inside of [[Our Lady of Saints Church]], Deadpool meet with it again and, this time, used it for good. [[Killer Thrill (Earth-616)|Killer Thrill]] had a plan to get their attention and capture the symbiote, by kidnapping Spider-Man as the symbiote would feel he's in danger. After her plan failed, the symbiote tried to eat him but Deadpool stopped it, thus ending their bond and friendship. The symbiote returned to the church, where Deadpool, stalking the symbiote, encouraged [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]], a man who was going to commit suicide because his career failed thanks to Spider-Man, to enter the church, as Deadpool believed Eddie would find what he wanted in there. Because the symbiote felt his hatred towards Spider-Man, they fused and became [[Venom]].{{r|{{cl|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 1}}-[[Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 5|5]]}}

'''[[Hybrid (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Amalgamated Symbiote]]''': After Deadpool was dismembered by [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]] and left for dead, the symbiotes [[Riot (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Riot]], [[Lasher (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Lasher]], [[Phage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Phage]], and [[Agony (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Agony]] bonded to him in order to take revenge on [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|their brethren]].{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 3}} After Carnage was subdued, Deadpool passed the four symbiotes on to [[Mercury Team (Earth-616)|Mercury Team]]'s [[Lasher (War Dog) (Earth-616)|German Shepherd]].{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 4}}

'''[[Loop Temporal Dislocation Harness]]:''' Given to Deadpool by [[Carl Weathers (Earth-616)|Dr. Carl Weathers]], who was working for the [[Time Variance Authority (Null-Time Zone)|Time Variance Authority]], in order for Deadpool and [[Wade Wilson (Loop) (Earth-616)|Loop]] to cure the cancer within the timestream.{{r|Deadpool & Cable: Split Second Infinite Comic Vol 1 4}}

| Transportation          = '''[[Deadpool's Teleporter|Teleportation Device]]:''' Deadpool has utilized different teleportation devices to whisk him out of (and occasionally into) danger. Deadpool was able to 'bodyslide' to wherever [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] is present, through Providence. At different periods Deadpool has possessed different teleportation technologies which he sometimes uses for combat.{{r|X-Force #5}}

Deadpool also briefly rode [[Macho Gomez]]' [[Macho's Space Sedan (Earth-616)|Space Sedan]] after he killed him in battle.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 33}}

He is able to charge his katanas with an energy field through his suit, increasing the durability of his swords and increasing their cutting power to the point that they can easily cut through objects as hard as diamond.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #15}}

'''Other Weapons:''' Deadpool employs any number of weapons depending on his current assignments. Most often, Deadpool uses multiple types of guns, grenades, swords, sai, and knives. He has also been known to use more exotic weapons such as concussive grenades, taser wires, constricting bolas, etc.{{r|New Mutants #98}}{{r|X-Force #11}}

==Speech Bubble==
Deadpool's [[Glossary:Speech Bubble|speech and thought balloons]] and captions are usually colored yellow, to represent his distinctive voice (although nobody knows exactly what is distinctive about his voice, only that it sounds different). [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-5701)|Cable]] of [[Earth-5701]] has described his voice as having a "gravelly, Demi Moore" quality before "killing" him,{{r|Cable & Deadpool #2}} and later as being a "ridiculous, hollow Demi Moore rumble".{{r|Cable & Deadpool #12}} Blind Al has also stated that Deadpool's voice sounds like a distinct mixture of "gasoline and gravel."{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 14}} In his earliest appearances, his speech balloons were normal balloons with red borders (soon changed to yellow borders); in later appearances, the interior was colored yellow and the text was written in a slightly mangled font.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 1}}

Deadpool's white caption box introduced in [[Deadpool Vol 4|''Deadpool'' (Vol. 2)]] was later revealed to be [[Madcap (Earth-616)|Madcap]], who had fused with the mercenary on a molecular level after an accident. Under similar circumstances to their fusion, they were later separated.{{r|Deadpool Annual Vol 3 1}}

Deadpool's yellow speech bubble has been shown to malfunction, resulting in all other characters hearing it.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #30|32}}

| Notes                   = * Deadpool often claims to be a [[Homo superior|mutant]] and an [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Man]], which causes more or less violent reactions from actual mutants and X-Men. He first claimed to have a "mutant healing factor" in {{cl|Wolverine Vol 2 88}}, which could arguably be seen as true since his healing factor was derived from Wolverine's mutant ability. Later, the X-Men dressed him up in an X-Costume as a gag in {{cl|Cable & Deadpool #8}}, prompting Deadpool to occasionally fixate on becoming a full member of the team. Often times he claims to be both a mutant and an X-Man, only to be corrected by someone nearby.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #17}}{{r|Cable & Deadpool #30}}{{r|Cable & Deadpool #34}}{{r|Deadpool vs. Thanos #1}} As Deadpool has become more accepted by the X-Men and the mutant community, they have been less insistent on correcting his claims.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 5}}
** When [[Earth-58163|House of M]] [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-58163)|Nathaniel Essex]] tried to drug him, he stated that Deadpool was a [[Homo superior|mutant]] due to resisting the drug, but Wade himself denied being one.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #17}}
** A computer used by [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]] identified Wade as a mutant.{{r|Deadpool vs. Thanos #2}}
** The 2016 film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' depicts him as a mutant with an initially-dormant healing factor.
** The mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] does not recognize Deadpool as a mutant.{{r|Deadpool Vol 8 6}}
* Deadpool's name is Wade Wilson, as that's the name he used to sign up with the army.{{r|Deadpool and Death Annual Vol 1 1998}} To his own satisfaction, Deadpool discredited T-Ray's claims to be the "real" Wade Wilson after Cable improved his mental stability and Wade poked several holes in T-Ray's version of events.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #39}} However, due to both T-Ray and Deadpool being mentally unstable, neither's word can actually be fully trusted. In Deadpool's words, "It depends on which writer you liked best."{{r|Cable & Deadpool #47}}
* Despite being an assassin, Wade is unwilling to kill children.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 4}}{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 19}} He has only once murdered a baby, [[Melody Jacobs (Earth-616)|Threnody]]'s [[Threnody's Child (Earth-616)|monstrous baby]], when defending [[Jack Hammer (Earth-616)|Weasel]]'s pregnant wife [[Clarice Hammer (Earth-616)|Clarice]].{{r|Deadpool: Assassin Vol 1 6}}
| Trivia                  = * Despite the common belief that Deadpool was inspired by DC Comics character [[w:c:dc:Deathstroke|Deathstroke]] (namely due to the similar designs and civilian names, with Deathstroke's real name being Slade Wilson), [[Rob Liefeld]] has always maintained that the similarities are coincidental, though several Deadpool's comics - such as {{cl|Deadpool Vol 6 7}} and {{cl|Black Panther vs. Deadpool Vol 1 5}} - have referenced and perpetuated the misconception. It is worth mentioning that Liefeld has been very vocal about the actual inspirations for the character, which include Spider-Man, Wolverine, ''[[w:c:starwars:Star Wars|Star Wars]]''<nowiki></nowiki>' [[w:c:starwars:Boba Fett|Boba Fett]], and even the 1988 comedy film ''[[wikipedia:Twins (1988 film)|Twins]]''. It was [[Fabian Nicieza]] who came up with Deadpool's civilian name, after recognizing the coincidental undertones of Deathstroke in Deadpool's look since Liefeld was a fan of Deathstroke. Nicieza called Deadpool "Wade Wilson" as as an in-joke between Liefeld and himself.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-legends-revealed-562/|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #562|work=CBR.com|first=Brian|last=Cronin|date=12 February 2016|accessdate=29 May 2018}}}}<ref name="Wondercon">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/wondercon-liefeld-deadpool-bad-blood/|title=Rob Liefeld Details Deadpool’s Origins, the Bad Blood in His Future|work=CBR.com|first=Hannibal|last=Tabu|date=3 April 2017|accessdate=29 May 2018}}</ref>
** ''Twins'' influenced Liefeld in the creation of Deadpool due to its plot. In this movie, the title characters portrayed by [[wikipedia:Arnold Schwarzenegger|Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[wikipedia:Danny DeVito|Danny DeVito]] originated from an experiment to combine the DNA of six fathers to produce the perfect child, with Schwarzenegger's character carrying all good traits, while DeVito's was stuck with the leftovers and became a low-life. Liefeld originally envisioned Deadpool as Wolverine's predecessor in Weapon X, which would've resulted in him being less refined than Logan. Because of this, Deadpool would've had a similar relation with Wolverine as DeVito's character with Schwarzenegger's.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/deadpool-rob-liefeld-twins/|title=Comic Legends: How Did the Movie Twins Influence Deadpool’s Creation?|work=CBR.com|first=Brian|last=Cronin|date=18 May 2018|accessdate=18 May 2018}}}}

* The creation of Deadpool as a masked character originated from the friendly jabs of Liefeld's friends [[Todd McFarlane]] and [[Erik Larsen]], who at the time worked penciling Spider-Man comics. They used to make fun of Liefeld having to work hard on drawing the faces of each member of the cast of ''New Mutants'', while drawing Spider-Man's face was much easier due to him wearing a mask. Because of this, Liefeld was inspired to create a character that wore a "cool mask."<ref name="Wondercon"/>

* The canonicity of Deadpool bonding to the Venom symbiote in ''[[Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars Vol 1|Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars]]'' and ''[[Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1|Deadpool: Back in Black]]'' was contested. Writer Cullen Bunn had repeatedly stated he considered it to be canon and had included references to it in ''[[Poison-X]]'' and {{cl|Deadpool: Assassin Vol 1 4}}. X-Men Senior Editor [[Jordan D. White]] also considered it to be canon, stating it to be the reason Deadpool admired and sought to befriend Spider-Man. However, Donny Cates, the writer of [[Venom Vol 4|''Venom'' Vol. 4]], had, [https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1157850030189023232 in a since deleted tweet] said that he did not consider them to be canon, and as such it was disregarded in ''[[Absolute Carnage]]'' - with {{cl|Absolute Carnage vs. Deadpool Vol 1 1}} stating the writers were deliberately ignoring it.
