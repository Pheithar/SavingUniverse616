| HistoryText             = When [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] and [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] founded a new mutant-only nation on the island of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoan]], they invited [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] to oversee the international trade relations. As both the White Queen of the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Trading Company]] and as a chief ambassador of Krakoa, Emma was given a seat in the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council]], Krakoa's first governing body, in return for exporting Krakoan miracle drugs to the rest of the world. The Hellfire Corporation was also awarded a second seat on the Council for the Black King, [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]], ensuring he would handle the black market trade with countries that rejected Krakoan sovereignty. As her final demand, Emma demanded a third seat for a person of her choosing.{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 5}} 

After [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kate Pryde]] learned that she could not interact with Krakoan [[Gateways]] for teleportation, she ended up hijacking a boat to get to the island. Upon her arrival, she was contacted by the White Queen, who offered her the chance to captain a ship to liberate mutants trapped inside hostile countries and unable to reach Krakoa. After freeing captive mutants from a rogue group of Russian agents with the help of [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], and [[St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616)|Pyro]], she named the new team the "[[Marauders (Pryde) (Earth-616)|Marauders]]" to distance the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] from their future activities as raiders.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 1}}

The Marauders sailed the oceans acting as hijackers to some and heroes to many, posing a rising interest to the U.S. Naval Intelligence. In one of their operations, the Marauders took control of one of the Black King's ships commanded by [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc the Leaper]]. Instead of sending the cargo to its original destination, an African nation, the Black King decided to sell it to an American rich club, a much more profitable deal. Such an intervention by the Marauders attracted the Black King's hatred, which would only grow even further when Pryde was officially appointed as the Hellfire Trading Company's Red Queen.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 2}} 

After [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] joined their ranks, the team was finally given a proper ship, the ''[[Marauder (Vehicle)|Marauder]]'', and kept doing their rescue missions all over the globe.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 2}}{{r|Marauders Vol 1 4}} Later, Pryde and Bishop went to [[Taipei]] to investigate the disappearance of [[Lim Zhao (Earth-616)|Lim Zhao]]. After a risky entrance, they discovered the kidnapping allegations were a ruse orchestrated by his wife, [[Chen Zhao (Earth-616)|Chen Zhao]], who was an adamant mutant hater and attempted to use mutants as scapegoats. After the mutant duo revealed her lies to the public during one of her speeches, Zhao formed a secret coalition with a new anti-mutant organization: [[Homines Verendi (Earth-616)|Homines Verendi]].{{r|Marauders Vol 1 4}}

In the meantime, Shaw was also scheming how to gain control of the Hellfire Company to himself. Confident that Pryde's inability to pass through the Krakoan gateways also meant that the [[Five (Earth-616)|Five]] would be unable to resurrect her if she died, he hired Homines Verendi to attack his own son [[Shinobi Shaw (Earth-616)|Shinobi]] and lure Pryde out to ambush her while she was alone. After immobilizing [[Lockheed (Earth-616)|Lockheed]] and dropping him into the water, Shaw wrapped Kate with Krakoan plants that nullified her powers, sinking her into the water. Though Lockheed survived, Pryde was drowned to death.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 6}} The rest of the team learned of Pryde's disappearance when they arrived at [[Island M]] with some rescued mutants and did not find her there as expected. Bishop went to [[Madripoor]],{{r|Marauders Vol 1 7}} where he found Pryde's body in the Homines Verendi's possession. Joined by Iceman and the White Queen, Bishop got her body from the Verendi, before they could autopsy the corpse.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 8}} While the Five tried to create a clone body for Pryde, the Marauders kept bringing mutants safely to Krakoa and fighting the threat of the Homines Verendi. After 18 attempts, Pryde was finally revived much to the joy of everyone, except Shaw.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 11|12}}

When Kate traveled to Madripoor to thank the people who had taken care of Lockheed while she was gone, she learned that the Verendi were trying to raze [[Lowtown (Madripoor)|Lowtown]] in order to gentrify it. To prevent them from doing so, the Hellfire Trading Company outbid them in buying multiple properties to ensure the safety of the people, including the creation of a free hospital for everyone. Revolted with this affront, the Verendi then unleashed the new [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]], composed of people recently maimed by mutants, against the Marauders, successfully causing an international incident that resulted in the Marauders being banned from Madripoor.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 17|18}} With their protectors gone, the people of Lowtown were pillaged and had their houses destroyed by the Reavers, so Pryde swam through the sewers to plant a secret Krakoan Gateway and allow a small team of [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] to sneak into the city and fight the Reavers.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 19}} Shortly after that, Storm quit the team in search of new things.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 20}}
