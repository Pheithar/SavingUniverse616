'''Katrina Luisa van Horn''' was a talented skier who was challenged to a battle of the sexes skiing contest by a chauvinistic male skier. During the ski run, the man cheated and cut her off, sending them both plummeting into a ravine. He was killed, and Katrina was crippled. Katrina became fanatically opposed to men, and a group of militant feminists somehow financed her being fitted with an exoskeleton that gave her superhuman strength and durability. Soon after, dubbing herself the Man-Killer, Katrina assassinated the anti-feminist mayor of [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]], but was soon opposed by the heroes [[Greer Grant (Earth-616)|The Cat]] and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]. Man-Killer was defeated, and was incensed to discover that her exoskeleton was created by male scientists working for [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]].{{r|Marvel Team-Up #8}}

Later, Man-Killer became affiliated with [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], and was sent to abduct prospective [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] director [[Franklin Nelson (Earth-616)|Foggy Nelson]]. As a result, Man-Killer clashed with the heroes [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] and [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], and was defeated when the Widow's ally [[Ivan Petrovitch (Earth-616)|Ivan Petrovich]] sabotaged her exoskeleton.{{r|Daredevil #121}}{{r|Daredevil #123}}{{r|Avengers #144}} Man-Killer resurfaced as an agent of [[Justin Hammer (Earth-616)|Justin Hammer]], and was part of an army of super-villains who attacked [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and was defeated.{{r|Iron Man #126|127}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #319}} Man-Killer was seen again when she abducted an influential female revolutionary, Hildy Dawes, from a courtroom. She came up against Spider-Man once again, this time with [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]], who in her civilian identity of Jennifer Walters was Dawes' lawyer. Man-Killer was defeated when Dawes grabbed some power cables, electrocuting them both.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #107}}

Surviving the electrocution, Man-Killer returned as a member of a new incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]], and as part of that team battled the villains-turned-heroes the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] several times. She now no longer needed her exoskeleton, having its powers within her body.{{r|Thunderbolts #3}} However after their defeat she left the team.{{r|Thunderbolts #18}} After a few brief skirmishes with the Thunderbolts,{{r|Thunderbolts #19|20}}{{r|Thunderbolts #23}} she rejoined the team,{{r|Thunderbolts #24}} but was defeated by the Thunderbolts once again.{{r|Thunderbolts #25}}{{r|Thunderbolts #27}}{{r|Thunderbolts #30}}{{r|Thunderbolts #34|35}}{{r|Thunderbolts #39}}

Using the name Wilma, Man-Killer started working as a bartender in a [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]] bar.{{r|Thunderbolts #40}}{{r|Thunderbolts #41}} One of the bar's patrons was the Thunderbolts member [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Atlas]], and the pair of them recognized each other but did not say so. The two built up an uneasy friendship, and Katerina strongly hinted that she was a lesbian. She began to ponder whether she could join the Thunderbolts herself, but when Atlas got in a fight with the hero [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] in her bar, she refused to help him as he was a man.{{r|Thunderbolts #42}}

Katrina later drifted back into the employ of [[Justine Hammer (Earth-616)|Justine Hammer]], where she again fought the Thunderbolts.{{r|Thunderbolts #64}} Man-Killer changed sides when she discovered Hammer had double-crossed her by fitting her body with a bomb to control her. Re-outfitting herself as a "hero" called Amazon, she joined the Thunderbolts.{{r|Thunderbolts #65}}{{r|Thunderbolts #67}}{{r|Thunderbolts #69}} After several adventures with them,{{r|Thunderbolts #71}}{{r|Thunderbolts #73|75}} she soon left them, deciding she didn't have what it took to be a hero.{{r|Marvel Universe: The End #5|6}}

Amazon turned back to crime, robbing a bank and fighting Spider-Man once again. She briefly flirted with a career as a professional wrestler before she joined a team of Thunderbolts led by Baron Zemo in his campaign to destroy [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Photon]]. To help in the battle, Fixer equipped her with size-altering [[Pym Particles]]. She was pitted against her former friend Atlas whom defeated her due to him having more experience with size alteration.{{r|New Thunderbolts #18}} Following the [[Superhuman Civil War]], Amazon joined the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|50-State Initiative]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #31}}

During [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark Reign|reign]], Man-Killer fought against the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]] when they launched an attack on [[Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #34}} She fought [[Elvin Haliday (Earth-616)|Rage]] during assault. As the resistance were joined by the [[Shadow Initiative (Earth-616)|Shadow Initiative]] the [[Hood's Gang (Earth-616)|Hood's Gang]] left to help during the [[Siege (Event)|Siege]] of [[Asgard]], leaving Katerina and the remaining team behind to combat the heroes with their [[Norn Stones|Norn Stone]]-enhanced powers.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #35}}

Man-Killer was next seen back at the bar in Colorado when she along with some others heard the call of the [[Crimson Gem of Cyttorak|Crimson Ruby of Cyttorak]]. Deciding to go, she left Colorado and headed to [[Thailand]] where the gem was located. She arrived there at the same time as the others were battling members of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. She immediately entered the brawl by taking out [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]] and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]]. During the fray the original possessor of the gem, [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Cain Marko]] teleported in with the [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]] to presumably reclaim his powers. Man-Killer then went one on one with Marko, but still having some residue strength left over from being the [[Juggernaut]], knocked Man-Killer straight out of the temple.{{r|Amazing X-Men Vol 2 16|17}}

Man-Killer joined up with Baron Helmut Zemo's third incarnation of the Masters of Evil and accompanied them in their fight against the Thunderbolts.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 10}} During the fight between the Masters and Thunderbolts, the Cosmic Cube entity Kobik threw a tantrum and threatened to rip all of reality apart. Man-Killer and her teammate [[Anton Vanko (Whiplash) (Earth-616)|Whiplash]] were caught in a maelstrom whipped by Kobik. Man-Killer held on to Whiplash, but Whiplash kicked Man-Killer away to save himself. Man-Killer collided with Kobik and was disintegrated.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 12}}
