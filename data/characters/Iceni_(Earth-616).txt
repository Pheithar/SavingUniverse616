===[[Whitechapel Murders]]===
This happened when the spirits felt the presence of [[Satana Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Satana]], who was traveling in the past alongside the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]]. At that point the spirits took possession of the corpses of indigent victims, including the victims of [[Jack the Ripper (Earth-616)|Jack the Ripper]]. Clashing with the Thunderbolts and Satan's refusal to join their struggle, the Iceni were soundly defeated and all were eliminated.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 166|167}}
