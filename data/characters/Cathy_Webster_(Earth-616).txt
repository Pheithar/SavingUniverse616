===Early Life===
Cathy Webster was born and raised in [[Macomb]], [[Illinois (State)|Illinois]]. She attended Hayden College and as a graduate student participated in an unsanctioned psychology experiment involving subliminal recordings at the Glasser Institute. She was subliminally programmed to hate all men, and her body subjected to "mutagenic radiation". The radiation enhanced her body to peak human conditioning similar to the [[Super Soldier Serum]] that enhanced [[Captain America]]. Cathy eventually overcame her brainwashing and discovered the woman in charge of the experiment was the criminal scientist named [[Deidre Wentworth (Earth-616)|Dr. Deidre Wentworth]], alias Superia.{{r|Captain America #431}}
