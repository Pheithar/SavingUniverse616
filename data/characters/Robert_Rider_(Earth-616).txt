| History                 = Robert Rider was the younger brother of [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Richard Rider]], aka [[Nova]]. Richard had always been insecure about Robbie being smarter than he was, but Robbie always looked up to his big brother.

At some point Richard confided in his family about his powers. Robbie was usually more supportive of Richard's role as a hero than their parents. At one point Robbie was kidnapped by a street gang called the [[Poison Memories (Earth-616)|Poison Memories]] who had a grudge against Nova's team, the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]]. The gang leader [[Kimeiko Ashu (Earth-616)|Kimeiko Ashu]] chopped off one of Robbie's fingers. Nova felt awful about this and later went to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] to talk to his brother and ask for his forgiveness. Robbie said there was nothing to forgive and he would gladly give up more fingers if that's what it took for his brother to save lives.{{r|New Warriors Vol 1 39}}

Robert once earned a lot of money from selling a software program he designed. He used the money he earned from that to buy the [[Long Island]] home the Rider family used to live in.{{r|Nova Vol 3 5}} Robert's parents had previously been living in [[Jackson Heights]], [[Queens]].{{r|New Warriors Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Robert Rider (Earth-616) from Nova Vol 1 21 0001.jpg|thumb|left|As a Nova]]
While working as a scientist at [[Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. (Earth-616)|Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.]], Robbie was selected to help reconstitute the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]] and became a member like his brother Richard. Robbie became friends with [[Christopher Powell (Earth-616)|Darkhawk]], with whom he worked at P.E.G.A.S.U.S..{{r|Nova Vol 4 17|31}}{{r|Nova Vol 4 35}} Even though Richard believed Robbie was among the members of the Nova Corps who sacrificed themselves in the [[Earth-10011|Cancerverse]],{{r|Thanos Imperative Vol 1 6}} he instead had returned to [[Xandar]] in an attempt to jump-start the faded [[Glossary:Nova Force|Nova Force]]. With no powers or a functioning ship, Robbie became stranded in the abandoned planet.{{r|All-New Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 11}}

===Talon-R===
Six months afterwards, Robbie was attacked by a group of scavenging [[Fraternity of Raptors (Earth-616)|Raptors]]. Using a device called the [[Inquisitor (Item)|Inquisitor]], the Raptors regularly forced Robbie into a simulated virtual reality with which he was brainwashed into serving the Fraternity of Raptors. Rejecting his previous life, Robbie even refused to be called "Talon Rider," going instead by the alias of Talon-R.

In order to help the Raptors' goal of finding the [[Infinity Stones]], Talon-R set out to find a set of [[Nega-Bands]].{{r|All-New Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 11}} Even though Talon-R secured a mummified corpse sporting Nega-Bands, his ship ended up in the hands of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], who rechristened it as the ''[[Milano]]''.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2017 All-New Guardians of the Galaxy}} Talon-R and his fellow Raptors eventually tracked down the ''Milano'' and boarded it, retrieving one of the Nega-Bands in the process. As he was making his escape, Talon-R poisoned [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]] with the tip of his claws.{{r|All-New Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 6}} [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] used the other Nega-Band to confront and defeat Talon-R, and they struck a deal. Once Talon-R handed over the antidote, Quill was to give him the other Nega-Band. Star-Lord complied, but first opened a portal in which he threw the band. When Talon-R jumped through the portal to follow the band, he found himself stranded in a distant planet where its inhabitants had been turned into [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]] hybrid zombies.{{r|All-New Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 8}}

===[[Infinity Countdown]]===
Talon-R had reunited with the Fraternity of Raptors by the time they attacked the Nova outpost in [[Xitaung]] where the giant-sized [[Power Stone]] was being guarded.{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 1}} During the attack, Talon-R encountered Rich, and berated him for the absence of the Nova Corps when he needed them. Their reunion was interrupted when they were both attacked by the [[Chitauri]] [[Warbringer (Earth-616)|Warbringer]],{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 2}} and Robbie was gravely injured. Before being taken away by soldiers since the Raptors decided to retreat, Robbie made Rich realize a way to reduce the Power Stone to a manageable size, by imposing one's cognition over reality. Star-Lord put this concept to practice, and the Guardians of the Galaxy managed to seize control of the stone.{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Infinity Countdown Darkhawk Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|As Dark Starhawk]]
Seeking to liberate [[Raptor Armor|the real Raptors]] from the [[Tree of Shadows]], the Fraternity took Talon-R to the [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]] Outpost IV so he could open a doorway to the [[Null Space]] with the power of his [[Nega-Bands]]. To their surprise, the real Raptors were already free and no longer needed to bond with a living being to work, which prompted them to kill all the pretenders save for Talon-R, who used the Nega-Bands to protect himself.{{r|Infinity Countdown: Darkhawk Vol 1 1}} Needing a living being to serve as the willing tribute of a ritual that would unlock the true power of the [[Ratha'kon (Earth-616)|Starhawk]] within their ranks,{{r|Infinity Countdown: Darkhawk Vol 1 2}} [[Gyre (Raptor) (Earth-616)|Commander Gyre]] convinced Talon-R to join them in their quest to bring order to the galaxy.{{r|Infinity Countdown: Darkhawk Vol 1 1}} With a subdued Chris Powell serving as the forced tribute, Gyre completed the ritual and transformed Talon-R into the Dark Starhawk.{{r|Infinity Countdown: Darkhawk Vol 1 2}}

Robbie and the Raptors planned to raze the [[Earth]] to eliminate their greatest threat, humanity, but they were confronted on the way there by Chris, Robbie's brother Nova, and [[Death's Head (Styrakos)|Death's Head]]. Nova, horrified for discovering his brother was the Dark Starhawk, tried his best to reason with Robbie during the intense fight that broke out, but his words fell on deaf ears. Preferring to carry out his own version of order in the universe, Robbie killed Gyre and invited his brother to join the Raptors. When Death's Head exploded a [[Kree]] warp core, wiping out all the Raptors except for Robbie, Chris took the opportunity to reclaim his Raptor Amulet. Though heavily injured, Robbie somehow managed to hit his Nega-Bands together and vanished in a flash of light.{{r|Infinity Countdown: Darkhawk Vol 1 3|4}}

===Quest for the Time Gem===
Robbie later assembled a new contingent of Raptors and obtained a new ship. He witnessed the [[Infinity Stones]] leave Earth after [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]] gave them sentience and noted that one Stone remained on Earth and that the Raptors needed to find the Stones' new wielders.{{r|Infinity Wars: Infinity Vol 1 1}}

When they got the chance, Robbie and the Raptors kidnapped the new wielder of the [[Time Stone]], [[Hector Bautista (Earth-616)|Hector Bautista]].{{r|Wolverine: Infinity Watch Vol 1 2}} Robbie tortured Hector to make him hand over the Time Stone, but Hector had no means of summoning it and had no control over its power. Then the Raptors' ship was boarded by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]], and the ghost dog [[Bats (Earth-616)|Bats]]. Wolverine and Loki were soon subdued. So, Loki traveled back to Earth to retrieve Robbie's mother [[Gloria Rider (Earth-616)|Gloria]], hoping she could talk some sense into her son.{{r|Wolverine: Infinity Watch Vol 1 3}}

Robbie had Wolverine placed in an incinerator so he could claim Wolverine's [[Adamantium|adamantium]] skeleton, but Wolverine escaped thanks to Bats giving him his [[Time Bat]]. When Loki appeared with Gloria, Robbie thought it was one of Loki's illusions and mortally wounded his mother, realizing too late that she was real. Hector was able to reverse this outcome after accidentally traveling several seconds into the past. Gloria then was able to talk Robbie down who claimed that he was looking for the Infinity Stones to reverse all the bad things that happened to their family. After reuniting with Wolverine, the [[Time Variance Authority (Null-Time Zone)|Time Variance Authority]] appeared to arrest Hector for manipulating the time stream with the Time Stone (actually an illusion created by Loki),{{r|Wolverine: Infinity Watch Vol 1 4|5}} but Warbringer then unexpectedly appeared to take the Time Stone. Robbie quickly created a force field to prevent everyone from floating out into space through the hole Warbringer made in the Raptors' ship.{{r|Wolverine: Infinity Watch Vol 1 4}}

Robbie's force field held up, but Warbringer hit it with enough force to cause to go through the Raptors' ship. When Warbringer attacked again, Hector inadvertently froze time around him. After learning to better control his powers, Hector returned time to normal and froze time around Warbringer. When the damage Warbringer did to the ship was causing it to self-destruct, Loki created a portal for everyone to flee to Earth. After that, Gloria angrily told Robbie to get into their home so they could talk, but Robbie told her that he couldn't and flew off into space using the Nega-Bands.{{r|Wolverine: Infinity Watch Vol 1 5}}
