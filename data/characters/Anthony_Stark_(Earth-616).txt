| Overview                = '''Tony Stark''' is a genius inventor and billionaire industrialist, who suits up in his armor of cutting-edge technology to become the super hero '''[[Iron Man]]'''. The adopted son of weapons manufacturer [[Howard Stark (Earth-616)|Howard Stark]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 17}} Tony inherited his family's company at a young age following his parents' death.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 288}} While overseeing a manufacturing plant in a foreign country, Stark was kidnapped by local terrorists. Instead of giving in to his captors' demands to build weapons for them, Stark created a powerful suit of armor for himself to escape.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 39}} Returning to America, Stark further upgraded the armor and put his vast resources and intellect to use for the betterment of the world as Iron Man.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 40}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 1}}

Tony kept his alter-ego a secret for most of his career, juggling his responsibilities as head of [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]] while becoming a key player in the superhuman community as Iron Man and founding the world's premier super hero team, the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. Over the years, Stark has faced numerous enemies, such as the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]], [[Justin Hammer (Earth-616)|Justin Hammer]], [[Obadiah Stane (Earth-616)|Iron Monger]] and the [[Boris Bullski (Earth-616)|Titanium Man]], as well as many personal demons, most notably his addiction to alcohol.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 128}} For many years, Tony covered for his alter-ego by claiming that Iron Man was his anonymous bodyguard, but Tony eventually brought his dual identity to the public light.{{r|Civil War: Front Line Vol 1 1}}

Recently, Tony escaped death by reconfiguring his body with a digital back-up of his mind,{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 599}} inadvertently causing him to become temporarily convinced that he was a clone of the real, late Tony Stark.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 19}} This resulted in Tony leading an army of artificial-life forms in a war against the anti-A.I. campaign of his adoptive brother [[Arno Stark (Earth-616)|Arno]].{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 1}} After coming around to the fact that he was the real Tony Stark all along, Tony stopped Arno's deranged plan to enslave humanity to stop a non-existent alien threat,{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 6}} and he then opted to embark on a journey of self-discovery to escape the baggage of his career. Stepping away from his high-tech lifestyle, Tony finds himself returning to his roots in an attempt to put back the "man" in Iron Man.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 1}}

| History                 = <center>''This is an abridged version of Tony Stark's history. For a complete history see '''[[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)/Expanded History|Tony Stark's Expanded History]]'''''</center>

===Birth and Adoption===
'''Anthony Edward Stark''', also known as '''Tony Stark''', was born to two [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, [[Amanda Armstrong (Earth-616)|Amanda Armstrong]] and [[Jude (Tony Stark's Father) (Earth-616)|Jude]]. Jude was a secret [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] double-agent with little regard for anybody but himself and regularly sold out fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives. He was almost responsible for Amanda's own death at the hands of an assassin. However, he fell in love with Amanda before sending her to her death and decided to save her.{{r|International Iron Man Vol 1 7}} After this incident they got to know each other and began a relationship.{{r|International Iron Man Vol 1 6}} Two years later, Amanda became pregnant. A week before giving birth to the baby, Jude decided to reveal his true allegiance to Amanda and its implications in Jude's timely intervention that saved her life. The subsequent discussion escalated, and Amanda killed Jude.

Traumatized by this development, Amanda asked S.H.I.E.L.D. to ensure her future baby would find a safe and happy home. However, director [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] followed the same procedure used for unwanted pregnancies in the agency, and the baby was left in an orphanage in [[Sofia (Bulgaria)|Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]] after Amanda birthed him in a local hospital. Fury's associate and famous industrialist [[Howard Stark (Earth-616)|Howard Stark]] learned of this and decided to find the baby and adopt him, keeping the name Amanda wished he retained: Anthony.{{r|International Iron Man Vol 1 7}}

[[File:Howard Stark (Earth-616), Maria Stark (Earth-616) and Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from International Iron Man Vol 1 7 001.jpg|thumb|left|Howard Stark presenting Tony to Maria]]
In addition to Howard and his wife [[Maria Stark (Earth-616)|Maria]] suffering the latter's inability to give birth again,{{r|International Iron Man Vol 1 6}} they needed to find a healthy boy to act as a decoy in place of their secret firstborn, [[Arno Stark (Earth-616)|Arno Stark]]. Arno's gestation had been extremely difficult, and his birth was only made possible with the help of an alien robot, the [[Rigellian Recorders|Rigellian Recorder]] [[Recorder 451 (Earth-616)|451]], who had agreed to help the baby survive in exchange for the opportunity to bioengineer him, so he could accelerate humanity's technological growth in the future.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 #10|11}}

However, as 451 genetically modified the baby in the womb, Howard had discovered the robot hid some sort of kill switch, that would compromise the life of his son in the future, for which Stark developed a "biococktail" to interfere with it behind 451's back.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 17}} Once Arno was born, 451 left the Earth.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 12}} In a turn of events, Howard's interference with 451's machinations caused the newborn to become fatally ill. The Starks decided to keep the baby hidden in the [[Maria Stark Foundation (Earth-616)|Maria Stark Foundation]] Hospice.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 17}} In addition to filling the void left by Arno's fatal illness, Tony's adoption would prevent 451 from learning of Howard's meddling if it ever returned to Earth.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 17}}

===Early Life and Education===
Tony grew up completely unaware of the existence of Arno or that he was adopted.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 17}} While loved unconditionally by Maria, Tony suffered from a strained relationship with his father, both due to the contrast of Tony's sensitive and reclusive nature with Howard's glorification of physical prowess{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 287}} and Howard's ever-increasing drinking habits, which caused him to verbally abuse Tony{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 285}} and suffer from mood swings. This last factor caused Tony to turn to electronics as a coping mechanism at barely five years old, as he started to believe hardware to be comprehensible and reliable, whereas people were unpredictable and hard to understand. Tony's world couldn't find order, but the things he built did.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 286}}

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Iron Man Vol 1 288 001.jpg|thumb|left|Tony's childhood]]
In order to toughen his son, Howard sent Tony to boarding school at the age of seven, much to Maria's dismay. In the following years, Tony learned of discipline of body and strength of character as Howard intended, while spending his free time reading alone. At the age of thirteen, the stories of Arthurian legends opened Tony the doors to a new world of dedication to a cause greater than oneself, of chivalry, honor, and armored heroes.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 287}}

After boarding school, Tony joined an undergraduate program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] at the age of fifteen.{{citation}} He would effortlessly graduate as class valedictorian with double majors in physics and engineering.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 288}} When he was seventeen, Tony met [[Meredith McCall (Earth-616)|Meredith McCall]], his first love and, unfortunately, the daughter of Howard's greatest business rival. Their relationship didn't develop beyond being a summer love, due to the combined interference of Meredith's father and Howard. Meredith was sent to live with relatives, and Tony was scheduled to go to Europe for education, with neither being told where the other was.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 28}}

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Iron Man Vol 1 288 002.jpg|thumb|left|Tony's young adult life]]
The break-up was numbed by Tony's school routine at [[Cambridge University]] in [[England]], where he met another girl named [[Cassandra Gillespie (Earth-616)|Cassandra Gillespie]]. Worse luck, Cassandra was also the daughter of a rival weapons manufacturer of Howard.{{r|International Iron Man Vol 1 1}} Their relationship and Tony's attendance to Cambridge were both cut short by Howard, who believed the recently-established relationship to be nothing but a way for the Gillespie's to get information on Howard through Tony.{{r|International Iron Man Vol 1 2}} Tony doubted Howard and even tried to run away with Cassandra, but she eventually admitted that while she had fallen in love with Tony, their relationship did start as a ploy of her mother.{{r|International Iron Man Vol 1 3}}

Around this time, Tony met [[Theodore Slaght (Earth-616)|Dr. Ted Slaght]] during a symposium. The physicist became a mentor to Stark, and taught him values beyond the importance of science, like the significance of guiding the search for knowledge with an ethical compass,{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 314}} and carrying an open mind.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 318}}

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Iron Man Vol 1 288 003.jpg|thumb|right|Tony taking over Stark Industries]]
Tony's mental dexterity caused him to drift into his 20's as shiftless thrill-seeker in the search for the challenges mundane life lacked. However, he would also lose interest in the dangerous hobbies he mastered, like skiing, parachuting, and hang-gliding.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 288}}

===Death of Howard and Maria Stark===
When he was twenty-one, Tony's parents died in a car crash and he inherited his father's business, [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]]. Within a few years, he turned it from solely a munitions firm to a multinational corporation with a range of interests covering virtually all types of contemporary scientific industry, and the leader at the cutting edge of electronics. Tony also bought the company that built the car his parents were driving when they lost their lives and fixed the flaws in their brake system.

Tony's new life as a CEO provided him with new challenges. But as the company grew bigger, his job became less exciting, and Tony fell into self-indulgence once again.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 288}}

===Inventing the Iron Man Armor===
While overseeing a military demonstration of his technology in [[Sin-Cong|Siancong]], Tony tripped a booby trap that killed his escort and lodged shrapnel in his chest.<ref group="note">See the ''[[#Notes|Notes]]'' section for a breakdown in the changes to the setting of Iron Man's origin</ref> The gravely injured Stark was taken captive by the terrorist leader [[Wong-Chu (Earth-616)|Wong-Chu]], and was informed that within a week the shrapnel would penetrate his heart and kill him. Wong-Chu falsely promised Stark that if he built a powerful weapon, he would be allowed to undergo an operation to save his life. Even though Stark realized the tyrant was lying, he agreed, hoping to gain time and access to tools.

Stark was given access to a small laboratory with another captive, the renowned Asian physicist and Nobel Prize in Physics laureate Professor [[Ho Yinsen (Earth-616)|Ho Yinsen]], whose work Stark admired in college. With Yinsen acting as his assistant, Stark designed and built an [[Iron Man Armor Model 1|electrically powered suit of armor]] with a pacemaker-like device that enabled Stark's heart to keep beating, the armor was also equipped with heavy offensive weaponry.

Donning the suit, Stark connected it to its power source, an electrical generator. Lying on a table Stark was helpless until the suit was fully charged. In the least fortunate turn of events, Wong-Chu decided to check on his prisoners. Knowing that if they were found all of their work was for nothing, Yinsen decided to sacrifice his own life by distracting Wong-Chu, giving Stark the extra time he needed to charge the armored suit fully. As the Iron Man, Stark avenged Yinsen's death and scattered Wong-Chu's guerrilla troops. Then, still clad in his armor, which was necessary to keep his heart beating, Stark made his way toward the front lines, trying to escape enemy territory.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 39}}

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Tales of Suspense Vol 1 39 001.jpg|left|thumb|Iron Man is born]]
[[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|James Rhodes]], a pilot with the [[United States Marine Corps (Earth-616)|United States Marines]], had been shot down by rockets while he was on a reconnaissance mission. Rhodes managed to land safely and was attempting to get his helicopter air-worthy when he encountered the wandering Iron Man. After Iron Man helped Rhodes fight off an attack by enemy forces, Rhodes allowed him to drain the helicopter's batteries to recharge his armor. The two continued to make their way back to American forces and stumbled upon a hidden rocket base. Stealing an enemy helicopter, they destroyed the site and flew to the nearest American base.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 144}}

Back in the [[United States of America|United States]], Stark redesigned his chest plate, which contained a pacemaker-like device, reducing the chest plate's size and weight so he could wear it under his normal clothing. Required to wear the armor's chest plate at all times to keep his heart alive and beating, Stark decided to put the rest of the armor to regular use as well.

After redesigning the entire armored suit to match the lighter chest plate, Stark made the existence of the suit public. He concealed the suit's true origin, as well as the fact that he himself had to wear the chest plate to live. Stark made it known that he would soon manufacture the suit, which he called "the human machine," for sale to be then public.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 244}}

===Becoming a Super Hero===
Soon afterward, Stark donned one of his battle suits in order to prevent thieves from stealing parts from the other copies of it. This experience made him realize that the suit was too dangerous to be made available to the public. The next day Stark revealed what had happened to him in the war zone to [[Joanna Nivena (Earth-616)|Joanna Nivena]], his then fiancé.<ref>[http://www.ironmanarmory.com/bioshn.html#nivena Nivena on ironmanarmory.com]</ref> Together they attended a tennis match in [[Forest Hills]], [[New York City|N.Y.]] that afternoon. Stark brought along his armor, which he was taking to a nearby laboratory for tests. Terrorists who threatened to kill everyone present with a bomb invaded the match. Joanna urged Stark to don the armor to stop the terrorists. Stark did so, captured the terrorists and saved the spectators by throwing himself atop the bomb. Iron Man thus publicly became a hero, and Stark had a new sense of purpose, having decided to combat evildoers as Iron Man.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 244}}

Wishing to retain some degree of anonymity, Stark established the fiction that Iron Man was his paid bodyguard wearing a suit of armor that he had invented. Only his most trusted aides learned Stark and Iron Man were one and the same. One of these early confidantes was [[Harold Hogan (Earth-616)|"Happy" Hogan]], whom Tony hired as his chauffeur.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 45}} Hogan fell in love with Tony's secretary [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Pepper Potts]], whom Tony eventually fell in love with as well.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 57}} Even though Potts reciprocated Tony's feelings, she eventually began a whirlwind romance with Hogan, which ended with the two of them getting married.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 91}}

At first, Stark used his Iron Man identity mostly to combat spies, like the [[Actor (Spy) (Earth-616)|Actor]],{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 42}} and criminals who threatened Stark Industries, like the [[Bruno Horgan (Earth-616)|Melter]] or [[Nathan Dolly (Earth-616)|Mr. Doll]].{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 47}}{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 48}}

During this time, the original [[Anton Vanko (Crimson Dynamo) (Earth-616)|Crimson Dynamo]] attacked Stark Industries, but Tony Stark persuaded him to defect.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 46}} Also, Stark faced off for the first time against the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]], who would become one of his most recurring enemies.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 50}}{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 54}}

Later, he expanded the scope of his alter ego's activities to battle any force or person who threatened the security of America or the world. Stark was instrumental in the organization and armament of the original global intelligence and law-enforcement agency known as [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. As Iron Man, he became an [[Avengers Charter|founding]] member of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, the team of super-human champions known as the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 1}} Stark donated his [[Manhattan]] [[Avengers Mansion|mansion]] to the Avengers for their exclusive use.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 2}}

[[File:Iron Man Vol 5 8 Many Armors of Iron Man Variant Textless.jpg|right|thumb|Iron Man's classic armor]]
As an Avenger, Stark would go on to participate in many missions over the years, although he sometimes had trouble reconciling his private affairs with his responsibilities in the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 7}} With the other remaining founders after the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] left,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 2}} he was among those who discovered the frozen form of the heroic [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], still frozen since [[World War II]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 4}} He was also the Avenger who sponsored the membership of [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], a man whom he had briefly fought with, after realizing his good intentions. Hawkeye was one of the new Avengers who joined when Stark and the other founders decided to take leaves of absence.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 16}}

Over the years Stark constantly refined and modified the design of his armor. From a bulky, transistorized iron suit, he eventually built a relatively lightweight, integrated circuit, magnetically-polarized suit with more human-looking articulated musculature.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 48}} Stark's extraordinary genius in theoretical mechanics has enabled him to keep his suit of armor state-of-the-art. Stark eventually underwent heart transplant surgery so that he was no longer obligated to wear his metallic chest plate.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 19}}

For moral reasons, Stark eventually decided to stop manufacturing armaments and devoted his company to other areas of technology.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 50}}

[[File:Illuminati (Earth-616) from New Avengers Illuminati Vol 2 1 0001.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Iron Man and the Illuminati.]]
===Illuminati===
In the wake of the [[Kree-Skrull War]], Stark initiated a meeting in [[Wakanda]] with [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]], [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]], [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]], [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], and [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] to form a clandestine, unnamed group to devise strategy and policy regarding overarching menaces (the "[[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]]"). Stark's original goal was to create a governing body for all super heroes in the world to answer to. However, the different beliefs and philosophies, besides the fact that many heroes chose to conceal their real identities, made Stark's plan impractical. Despite this, the group agreed to share vital information.{{r|New Avengers: Illuminati Vol 1 1}}

===Alcoholism and a New Iron Man===
In recent years Tony Stark's greatest nemesis has been alcoholism.<ref>[http://www.ironmanarmory.com/earlyyears.html Early Years on ironmanarmory.com]</ref> As a wealthy socialite, alcohol had been a constant part of his life. When his company, which had changed its name from Stark Industries to [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark International]], was threatened with the takeover at the same time he was experiencing oppressive personal problems, Stark began to abuse alcohol. Although he managed to recover quickly from his first serious bout, the compulsion to drink remained a constant temptation. The second time he succumbed to alcoholism, due to even more devastating personal problems than the first time, Tony Stark went on a several month binge during which he was cheated out of Stark International, had all Iron Man suits destroyed (except one), lost the leases on his various apartments, and had his personal assets frozen so that he could not touch his fortune. All of this was the result of the machinations of the mysterious entrepreneur [[Obadiah Stane (Earth-616)|Obadiah Stane]], who took over Stark's company, renaming it [[Stane International]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 173}}

During this time, Stark's friend James Rhodes, who had gone to work for Stark after leaving the military, assumed custody of the Iron Man armor and operated as Iron Man in his stead.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 170}}

When Stark finally regained his sobriety, he joined with Rhodes and two of his friends, [[Morley Erwin (Earth-616)|Morley Erwin]] (late of Stark International) and his sister [[Clytemnestra Erwin (Earth-616)|Clytemnestra Erwin]] of Richmond Enterprises, to set up a new electronics firm in [[California (State)|California]] named [[Circuits Maximus (Earth-616)|Circuits Maximus]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 187|188}} In its brief existence, Circuits Maximus became a prestigious and successful firm.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 188|199}}

While the armor was in his custody, Jim Rhodes became increasingly enamored with being Iron Man and, upon Stark's return to sobriety, feared that Stark would ask for it back. The cybernetic helmet had never been properly calibrated to Rhodes' brain patterns; he began to have severe headaches and his thinking was clouded. As a result Rhodes began to manifest hostility toward Stark. As part of his therapy, Stark constructed a simple suit of armor based on his original design with no intention of donning it until he felt in control of his alcoholism. When Rhodes began acting irrationally, however, Stark felt obligated to put on this crude suit of armor to prevent Rhodes from doing harm. Stark managed to subdue Rhodes and made necessary recalibrations on the cybernetics. For a brief time Stark and Rhodes used their respective suits of armor as Iron Men, although Stark did so reluctantly. At the suggestion of the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]] chairman, Hawkeye, Stark designed and built his most sophisticated armor to date, presumably so that the Avengers could find someone to wear the suit and bolster the team's strength.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 193}}

[[File:Anthony Stark and Obadiah Stane (Earth-616) from Iron Man Vol 1 200 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Battling Iron Monger.]]
However, soon after its completion, Obadiah Stane became alarmed at Stark's steps toward recovery. Circuits Maximus was bombed, injuring Rhodes and killing Morley Erwin.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 #199|200}} Desiring vengeance, Stark donned the untested new armor and sought out Stane. Stane himself put on a suit his engineers had built using Stark's plans, and met Iron Man in battle as the [[Iron Monger Armor|Iron Monger]]. Losing the battle against Stark, Stane committed suicide.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 200}}

Stark decided that although one is never truly cured of alcoholism, he could also not deny the responsibility of being Iron Man. He resumed his career as Iron Man, and joined the new West Coast branch of the Avengers.

===Founding Stark Enterprises===
Stark also managed to reclaim control of his fortune, although he decided not to claim ownership of the company formerly known as Stark International. Rather, he founded a new technological design and manufacturing company, [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Enterprises]], based in Silicon Valley in Northern California. Stark Enterprises quickly became a highly successful and innovative company.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 217}}

===Armor Wars===
Stark learned that an industrialist calling himself [[Spymaster (Ted Calloway) (Earth-616)|Spymaster]] had stolen the plans for the many secret technological innovations found in the [[Iron Man Armor|Iron Man armor]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 225}} Spymaster had then turned these plans over to Stark's most powerful and antagonistic business rival, [[Justin Hammer (Earth-616)|Justin Hammer]], who in turn had made them available to criminals. These criminals had then incorporated the stolen technological innovations into their own armored battle suits. Outraged that his inventions were being used for criminal activity, and even for killing, Stark determined to deprive these criminals of his secrets. He planted a computer virus in Hammer's computer system that would wipe out all traces of the plans for Stark's Iron Man technology. As Iron Man, Stark sought out and caught many criminals and others (such as the United States government's [[Guardsmen (Earth-616)|Guardsmen]]) who wore a battle suit utilizing his technology. He implanted devices called 'negator packs' on their armor to fuse the circuits, rendering the suit useless. With the computer records of the plans for his technology gone, presumably it could not be used in reconstructing the suits.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 228}} Iron Man accidentally killed the second [[Kondrati Topolov (Earth-616)|Titanium Man]] (also known as the Gremlin) in the course of these "Armor Wars."{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 229}}

The United States government branded Iron Man an outlaw as a result of these and other vigilante actions, and his longtime Avengers comrade Captain America was among those opposing him. Stark publicly claimed that he had fired Iron Man in displeasure over his illegal activity. He even went so far as to create a false history for "Randall Pierce," allegedly the original Iron Man's identity, which he turned over to the government. Shortly afterward, Iron Man was apparently destroyed in combat with government forces.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 230}}

In fact, however, Stark had survived. He created an even more sophisticated armored battle suit to wear as Iron Man using technology far more advanced than that which Spymaster had stolen from him. Stark continued to go into action as Iron Man, but publicly claimed that the previous Iron Man was dead and that another employee of his whose identity was being kept secret was now wearing the armored suit.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 231}}

===Stark Shot===
Later, [[Kathleen Dare (Earth-616)|Kathy Dare]], a former lover of his with an unstable mind, shot Stark.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 242}} The gunfire severely injured Stark's spine and it appeared he could be crippled for the rest of his life, unable to walk. However he could still function normally within his Iron Man armor. A microchip device was later implanted in Stark's spine that enabled him to walk and move normally once again. During this time, Stark was part of a team of Avengers that traveled into Kree space when Earth's sun was endangered by their attempt to use the sun as a power source for a hypergate in their new conflict with the Shi'ar, which led to Stark leading a group of Avengers to kill the Kree Supreme Intelligence when its actions destroyed a sizeable portion of the Kree empire to try and jumpstart the species evolution.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 347}}

The 'bio-chip' that allowed Stark to walk proved problematic and degenerative nerve damage occurred. This was aggravated by the attack of [[Kearson DeWitt (Earth-616)|Kearson DeWitt]], a madman who claimed Stark had stolen his father's designs. DeWitt had Stark's nervous system attacked with a techno-organic virus, but Stark was able to survive. He temporarily had to be placed in cryo-stasis, with James Rhodes taking his place as CEO.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 284}} Soon after recovering, Stark was injured from feedback from a 'telepresence' system to remotely control his Iron Man armor and battle [[Ultimo (Earth-616)|Ultimo]]. Stark eventually recovered after extensive rehabilitation.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 299|300}}

Stark was forced to restructure Stark Enterprises when several of Stane's business decisions were leaked to the press. This also caused a number of other heroes to confront Iron Man, such as the Hulk regarding gamma bomb production plants.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 301|306}}

Stark also quarreled with Rhodes over several good-intentioned but wrong decisions Jim made as CEO (such as selling off nuclear assets to a dummy company secretly operated by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]]), as well as his actions in [[Imaya]]. Rhodes was still angry Stark had lied to him about his nerve damage condition. The two briefly clashed in battle, ultimately repaired their friendship.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 310}}{{r|War Machine Vol 1 8}}

Tony agreed to end the West Coast Avengers after internal tensions over past conflicts,{{r|Avengers: West Coast #102}} but formed [[Force Works (Earth-616)|Force Works]] instead. Intending for this team to try and preempt natural and man-made disasters rather than just reacting to events, Stark provided his team with full access to his cutting-edge technology.{{r|Force Works #1}}

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Iron Man Vol 1 319 0001.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Traitor]]
===Immortus and Younger Self===
Later, while under the influence of [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]], Stark committed a number of horrible acts and was killed. Stark was temporarily replaced by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-96020)|a younger version of himself]] from another timeline.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 395}} This was corrected when [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]] brought him and the other heroes who sacrificed themselves against [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]] back. When the replacement Tony Stark returned to the [[Earth-616|Marvel Universe]], he was merged with the Earth-616 Tony Stark who was resurrected thanks to Franklin Richards. Shortly after returning he subjected himself to judgment by his fellow Avengers and was exonerated.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 2 2001}}

===Stark Solutions===
Stark declined to challenge the Fujikawa acquisition and formed a new company, [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Solutions]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 1}} Injuries from battling the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]] and other foes revealed a danger of long-term armor exposure. The armor's power systems and insulation were significantly redesigned to compensate. [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]]'s AI was recovered from [[Sunset Bain (Earth-616)|Sunset Bain]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 11}}

The [[Sons of Yinsen (Earth-616)|Sons of Yinsen]], who became worshipers of his mentor and the Iron Man technology, contacted Tony.{{r|Iron Man Annual Vol 1 2000}}

===Secrets and Lies===
When Iron Man defeated the villain Mentallo, Tony took advantage of the situation and used Mentallo’s global mind control device to erase all knowledge of his often-compromised secret identity from every person on Earth. He then revealed it to those people he deemed trustworthy, causing them to remember the memories he had buried.{{r|Iron Man & Captain America Annual Vol 1 1998}}

===Sentient Armor===
While fighting [[Marco Scarlotti (Earth-616)|Whiplash]] during a storm, Iron Man's armor became sentient.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 15}} This would be later revealed due to the Ultron Imperative.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 48}} The Safe Armor developed a feeling of over protection, and tried to replace Stark, but ultimately sacrificed itself to repair damage to its creator's heart caused during a fight.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 30}}

===S.K.I.N. Armor===
After this experience with the Sentient Armor, Tony suffered an uncharacteristic bout of technophobia, and decided to give up being Iron Man and Tony Stark. He gave away his fortune and adopted the persona of 'Hogan Potts' and posed as a simple worker at Askew Electronics, incorporating a new alloy called [[S.K.I.N. Armor|S.K.I.N.]] into his armor designs. After a test run against the [[Herman Schultz (Earth-616)|Shocker]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 42}} Iron Man faced [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], the [[Ghost (Earth-616)|Ghost]], and finally [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]], after the villain revealed his role in manipulating the Sons of Yinsen, the sentient armor, and corrupting the S.K.I.N. technology.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 48}}

Stark investigated an early military armor that had been distributed to rebel forces around the world.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 50}}

[[Temugin (Earth-616)|Temugin]] also made his presence felt, challenging Iron Man for the apparent death of his father, the Mandarin.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 53}}

===The Best Defense===
The U.S. military attempted to claim older model Iron Man armor.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 55}} Their pretense was that Stark had not patented the technology and that he violated agreements made after the Armor Wars by continuing to adventure as Iron Man. At the same time, a new Secretary of Defense was needed. Stark vied for the position and halted a disaster involving the technology as Iron Man.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #73|78}}

===New Avengers===
The Avengers were disassembled due to the actions of an unbalanced [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], which led to the deaths of [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]], [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], and Hawkeye. During this crisis, Stark was manipulated by the Scarlet Witch to suddenly threaten a [[Latveria|Latverian]] ambassador at a [[United Nations (Earth-616)|UN]] meeting.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 #500|503}} Additionally, [[Clarence Ward (Earth-616)|Clarence Ward]] used stolen armor to kill nearly all of Stark Industries' board and [[Rumiko Fujikawa (Earth-616)|Rumiko Fujikawa]], Stark's girlfriend.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 87}} In light of the incidents, Stark resigned as Secretary.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 89}}

Six months later, a massive breakout was executed at the [[Raft]]. While flying around the city, Iron Man arrived at the prison to aid Captain America, [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]], [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], [[Veranke (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]], [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]], and the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] in keeping prisoners in after a prison break.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 1}} Steve believed this event, the gathering of heroes by chance to fight a common foe, was a signal that the Avengers needed to be reformed. Tony was initially reluctant to make a new team but eventually agreed. The [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] used the [[Stark Tower]] as their headquarters.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Iron Man Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 31 Textless.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Tony's Extremis Armor]]
===[[Extremis]]===
Stark returned to work at a hectic pace, often sleeping in his lab. A former classmate of his named [[Maya Hansen (Earth-616)|Maya Hansen]] asked for help, a super soldier project named [[Extremis virus|Extremis]] had been given to a small terrorist group.{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 1}} Iron Man battled the augmented terrorist [[Mallen (Earth-616)|Mallen]], but suffered massive injuries.{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 #3|4}} Being forced to use Extremis on himself, Iron Man healed and found himself able to directly interface with technology, especially with [[Iron Man Armor Model 29|his new armor]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 5}} Going after Mallen again, the terrorist forced Tony's hand, and he had to kill him.{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 6}}

===Civil War===
Learning of the government's plans to instigate a [[Superhuman Registration Act]] that would force costumed super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government and sign on as licensed agents, Iron Man at first sought to defeat the proposal, even going to such lengths as to hire the [[Boris Bullski (Earth-616)|Titanium Man]] to attack the hearing on the act as he testified in order to manipulate opinion in his favor.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 #529|531}} However, Tony's opinion of the Act changed, seeing it as a new means to achieve the goal that he had sought in forming the Illuminati, and to tie the knots of friendship between humans and super heroes. Additionally, Stark believed that the environment of fear caused by events like [[Secret War|Nick Fury's Secret War]] or the [[House of M]] was going to cause the Act to pass unconditionally, and it was better to support and diffuse it at the moment before any further events made the conditions of the superheroic community worsen.{{r|New Avengers: Illuminati Vol 1 1}}

After a disaster at [[Stamford]], [[Connecticut (State)|Connecticut]] involving the group of amateur heroes the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]] fighting supervillain in which over 600 people died, mostly being children from a school, the public opinion against super humans turned and fast-tracked the Act into law. The new law split the hero community in two.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 1}} Tony knew that with no major representative in favor of the SRA, the government would've applied harsh measures, and that going to the "good old days" wasn't an option.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 5}} Because of that, he decided to provide a fairer path and lead the pro-Registration forces himself.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 1}} The anti-Registration side was led by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Civil War Vol 1 2}} In his first major public action as a supporter of registration, Stark again unmasked as Iron Man.{{r|Civil War: Front Line Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Civil War Vol 1 7 Turner Variant Textless.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Leading the Superhuman Registration Act]]
As part of his measures to deal with the anti-Registration forces, Iron Man, [[Criti Noll (Clone) (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]] and Reed Richards created the [[Prison 42]] in the [[Negative Zone]], a holding facility specially designed to contain rogue super heroes, for as long as the Civil War lasted. It was a temporary measure because heroes could easily escape from prisons like the [[Raft]]. The trio also built a [[Thor Odinson (Ragnarok) (Earth-616)|cyborg clone of Thor]] and used nanobots to control the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] as a task force to hunt down unregistered heroes.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 4}}{{r|Civil War: Front Line Vol 1 5}}{{r|Civil War Vol 1 5}}

The Pro-Registration forces proceeded to set a trap for the Anti-Registration side. They surrounded them, and Iron Man tried to reach a truce to stop fighting and work together to reach a middle ground. However, Captain America rejected Iron Man's proposal, and attacked him, leading to a direct conflict between the two sides, during which the Thor clone malfunctioned, and killed [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Goliath]] in cold blood.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 4}} Events like this led Tony to doubt himself. People like [[Miriam Sharpe (Earth-616)|Miriam Sharpe]], the mother of one of the victims of the Stamford incident,{{r|Civil War Vol 1 4}} and Tony's best friend [[Harold Hogan (Earth-616)|Happy Hogan]] would motivate him to carry on.{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 13}} Shortly after, Happy would be attacked by Spymaster in an attempt to get Iron Man and succumb to his injuries. He was rushed to a hospital and placed on life support, but died shortly afterwards.{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 14}}

Prior to the events of the Civil War, Stark assisted fellow New Avenger Spider-Man and his family. Peter Parker came to regard Stark as a mentor, became his assistant, and accepted a new [[Iron Spider Armor|technologically enhanced costume]] from him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 529}} Stark also convinced Spider-Man to unmask and go public with his identity as well.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 2}} However, Peter's feelings of being manipulated and unease about the rightness of Stark's cause grew until Stark revealed a prison for super humans he and Mister Fantastic had built in the [[Negative Zone]]. When Spider-Man attempted to escape from [[Stark Tower]], after secretly moving his family out, in order to join the [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Resistance]], he attacked Stark, who had confronted him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 35}} However, due to Spider-Man's override of the suit given to him by Stark and some unexpected intervention by the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]], the web-slinger managed to escape and was now considered a traitor by Stark and the Pro-Registration side.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 5}}

During an attempt to free the prisoners from Prison 42, the Anti and Pro-Registration sides clashed in combat, and were taken to NYC by [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]]. Eventually, Captain America would realize the conflict was being tackled the wrong way, and surrendered. The Anti-Registration side was granted amnesty, with Cap agreeing to go on trial for his actions during the Civil War.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 7}}

However, while in custody, Captain America was killed in an assassination orchestrated by the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]].{{r|Captain America Vol 5 25}} Stark was devastated by his friend's death, and left unsure on how to proceed. In a letter Steve had written before his death, he asked Tony to insure that the Captain America legacy lived on and to look out for [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky Barnes]]. Tony was instrumental in getting Bucky to assume the mantle of Captain America.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 #33|34}}

===Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.===
[[File:Iron Man Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Annual Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]
During the Civil War, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] suggested that Tony would become the next acting head of S.H.I.E.L.D. She cited his higher qualification than her, and the fact that it would "piss the right people off."{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 25}} After the dust settled, Stark was appointed with the position of Director.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 7}}

Iron Man and the other Illuminati were responsible for exiling Hulk from Earth, and were the people Hulk sought revenge on when he returned. Luckily, Stark saw this possibility as an eventuality, and was prepared to engage the Hulk with a brand new [[Hulkbuster Armor|Hulk-Buster armor]].{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 1}} The battle between them destroyed most of [[New York City]], and blows were thrown so powerful that no other hero could get close enough to help or act. Stark Tower collapsed on top of the two during the battle, and ultimately, Hulk took Tony captive to the Stadium with the rest of his captured heroes. Once all of Stark's sources (and comrades) were exhausted, he rendered the Hulk (who had been weakened from his fight with the Sentry) unconscious with orbiting military satellite lasers he helped install during his appointment as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. He had to draw money from numerous sources (most notably S.H.I.E.L.D itself) to repair Avengers Tower and the several damaged buildings and structures of New York.{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 5}}

As Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Iron Man investigated the death of [[Nebraska Initiative (Earth-616)|Nebraska Initiative]] member, [[Lucy Cervantes (Earth-616)|Gadget]] and stumbled upon her investigation of hundreds of missing persons.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 22}} Realizing that Stark was a danger to his work with [[Prometheus Gentech, Inc.]] in creating a new super-soldier, Secretary of Defense [[Jack Kooning (Earth-616)|Jack Kooning]] had him depowered from his [[Iron Man Armor Model 29|Extremis Armor]] and placed on leave for mental strain.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 23}} Stark secretly returned to Nebraska and with the help of [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Leonard Samson]] and [[Griffin Gogol (Earth-616)|Captain Ultra]] discovered that Prometheus Gentech was using the missing persons as test subjects for the [[Extremis virus]] and that [[Maya Hansen (Earth-616)|Maya Hansen]] was unwittingly working for a reborn Mandarin to create an aerosolized version of the virus which he intended on unleashing to create a race of superhumans.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 25}} Iron Man, forced to use outdated armor, confronted the Mandarin and a cadre of Extremis-enhanced combatants at the Prometheus laboratories. He ordered S.H.I.E.L.D. to take out the complex with a miniature warhead contained within the gravitational pull of a black hole, thus limiting the damage just to the laboratory, as he tried to escape the event perimeter.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 26}} Mandarin escaped to [[China]] with Maya Hansen and pretended to be Tony Stark and convinced her to give him the sequence for the aerosolized virus. Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D. were taken into custody by the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities (Earth-616)|Commission on Superhuman Activities]] for their release of the nuclear device in Nebraska. Stark's main witness, Jack Kooning escaped to Myanmar and enlisted the help of [[Xang Kong (Earth-616)|Xang "King" Kong]] in tracking down the Mandarin, but was killed by him before he could take him out with a sniper rifle. Stark is convicted, but [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dugan]] orchestrated an attack on the United Nations over which S.H.I.E.L.D. has jurisdiction as a distraction for Stark to escape and to track the Mandarin to China. In defeating the Mandarin, Stark is forced to cut off part of his foot to remove the Extremis armor dampener but was able to redirect the virus-containing rockets by sending them to an extremely high altitude and killing the virus. Having saved the day, he was cleared of all charges and reinstated as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 #27|28}}

[[File:Secret Invasion Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|200px|right|thumb|During the Skrull Invasion.]]
During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]] Stark's armor was infected by an alien cyber virus which ultimately purged him of the Extremis virus.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 1}} Stark discovered Spider-Woman herself was the Skrull Queen [[Veranke (Earth-616)|Veranke]] who nearly deceived him to join ranks with her.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 3}} He was saved by [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] who upon Tony's request left him with [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] who acted as his defense until he could fix his damaged armor to a point to where it was fully functional.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 4}} Tony led the heroes of New York against the Skrull invaders.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 6}} His armor however, began to fail in midst of the battle forcing him to return to [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] for another one.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 7}} The [[Barack Obama (Earth-616)|President of the United States]] was less than reasonable regarding Stark's action and ultimately removed Stark as director of S.H.I.E.L.D, and disbanded the entire agency itself.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 8}} Although the battle against the alien invasion had been won, Tony suffered a great loss. His technology was nonfunctional, his corporations were in dismay, he had many new enemies, and little to no allies willing to help him with any of his problems.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 8}}

===Dark Reign===
After the invasion, the U.S. government also disbanded the Avengers, handing control of the Initiative over to [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]. Iron Man was later a member of [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]]'s [[Mighty Avengers (Pym) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]].{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 21}} Before fighting the threat of [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]], Iron Man helped to subdue the Hulk.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 22}} He left the team after realizing he was not yet ready to be a part of it.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 23}}

With his Extremis powers failing, Stark was able to upload a virus that destroyed all records of the Registration Act, thus preventing Osborn from learning the identities of his fellow heroes. The only copy of this database remained in Stark's head, while he was now on the run in one of his extra armors, and his remaining armor in Stark Tower were now in Osborn's hands.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 10}}{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 1}} Iron Man managed to gain a new armor and fought Namor in the Stark Undersea Base.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 11}} Stark was able to outsmart the [[Atlanteans|Atlantean]] and escape the collapsing base. Osborn then placed a bounty on Stark's head, offering mountains of gold to the [[Hood's Gang (Earth-616)|Hood's gang]]. The members of the secret organization the [[Cabal (Dark Illuminati) (Earth-616)|Cabal]] gathered to discuss many issues, among which was the hunt for Stark. Stark was losing intelligence by the day which slowed his thinking time and caused him to not be able to pronounce difficult words correctly. He started gathering and assembling parts to make his Iron Man suit easier to navigate and control as it was becoming more and more difficult for him to do so. He later abandoned it for the [[Crimson Dynamo Armor|Dynamo Armor]], which he borrowed from [[Dimitri Bukharin (Earth-616)|Dimitri Bukharin]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 14}} Tony was later tracked down by Pepper but the two were captured by [[Giuletta Nefaria (Earth-616)|Madame Masque]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 15}}

He managed to escape with Pepper's help, but was forced to leave her behind so she could fend off Masque. He then made his way to Siancong, but before he could reach his destination, he was shot down by militants. With his armor destroyed, Tony was forced to abandon it and proceed on foot to his destination, the secret laboratory that Stark worked with Ho Yinsen as a captive in developing the first [[Iron Man Armor Model 1|Iron Man Armor]]. Dusting off the outdated computer systems, Stark was able to reactivate the old suit, which was now the only armor simple enough for his deteriorating mind to operate.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 18}}

When Osborn personally caught up to the debilitated Stark and beat him savagely, Pepper Potts broadcast the beatings, costing Osborn credibility and giving Stark public sympathy. Stark went into a vegetative state, having previously granted [[Donald Blake (Earth-616)|Donald Blake]] (Thor's alter ego) power of attorney.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 19}} 

===Stark Disassembled===
A holographic message stored in Pepper's armor revealed that Stark had developed a means of 'rebooting' his mind from his current state prior to his destruction of the database. Blake and Bucky resolved to use it to restore him to normal despite Stark's offer in the message to stay in his current state if it would make things easier and Pepper's own uncertainty about the fact that Tony could come back when so many others could not.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 20}}

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 20 0001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Stark Disassembled.]]
The procedure on how to reboot Stark was very complicated. First, they had to place Pepper's electromagnet implant onto his chest, which would be fueling his entire biology. Then they jacked in the hard drive that Maria Hill recovered, which was a backup copy of his brain before he underwent the Extremis injection and then they activated the implant by channeling Thor's lightning through Captain America's shield connected to it.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 21}}

Meanwhile, in the last remaining vestiges of Stark's mind, he was in a barren wasteland, digging for the lost relics of his life, assisted by a couple named Howard and Maria. However, every time he found something, giant machines resembling his own Titanomechs would attack, causing the illusion to reset. He eventually found he was digging for an iron chest plate, resembling the original version of his armor.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 20}}

Back on Earth, Pepper, Rhodey, and Captain America sent in Doctor Strange to help Tony after the first attempt to revive him failed. The Ghost interrupted the doctor's ritual, but Tony Stark manually overcame his coma and used the Ghost's ghost phone to transport the assassin away. It was then everyone realized Tony's backup memory drive was not quite complete, as he was awed by the events he read about on his computer after the skirmish, which included the Civil War, Captain America's assassination, the Secret Invasion, and Dark Reign.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 24}}

===Siege===
During most of the [[Siege (Event)|Siege of Asgard]] Tony Stark was out of commission, but returned wearing an older version of his armor, disabling Norman Osborn's stolen Iron Patriot armor and signaling the return of all three main Avengers; including Thor and Steve Rogers.{{r|Siege Vol 1 3}} He was instrumental in the defeat of the [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|Void]], by ramming a [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] [[Helicarrier]] into the villain at full speed, weakening him, finally giving Thor the chance to kill him.{{r|Siege Vol 1 4}}

===Heroic Age===
In the aftermath of Siege, the superhuman registration act was repealed thanks to the efforts of Steve Rogers, who now took over the position of the overthrown Norman Osborn. Iron Man reunited with Thor and Steve Rogers and rekindled their relationship while setting their past differences aside.{{r|{{cl|Avengers Prime Vol 1 1}}-[[Avengers Prime Vol 1 5|5]]}}{{r|{{cl|Avengers Prime Vol 1 1}}-[[Avengers Prime Vol 1 5|5]]}} Iron Man and Thor were assigned to Avengers along with Bucky Barnes as Captain America while Steve Rogers headed the [[Secret Avengers (Black Ops Unit) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]]. Iron Man was slightly troubled that he may not be able to take orders from Steve, but Steve told him that Maria Hill would oversee the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 1}}

With a new lease on life, Tony built a [[Iron Man Armor Model 37|new model of armor]] with the help of Mister Fantastic and announced that he would make a new company, [[Stark Resilient (Earth-616)|Stark Resilient]], to rebuild his former wealth and to extend his repulsor technology as a civilian energy source, pulling from making government weapons.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 25}}

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 25 001.jpg|thumb|right|Tony's Bleeding Edge Armor]]
Meanwhile, [[Sasha Hammer (Earth-616)|Sasha Hammer]] and [[Justine Hammer (Earth-616)|Justine Hammer]] from [[Hammer Industries (Earth-616)|Hammer Industries]] filled in the gap in military technology left by Stark Industries, with their own [[Detroit Steel Armor]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 26}} They attempted to sabotage Stark's attempts at testing and presenting the new repulsor car developed by Stark Resilient, but failed. During a race to test the car, drones controlled by the Hammer girls and [[Doug Johnson III (Earth-616)|Detroit Steel]] attacked the event, in an attempt to destroy Stark Resilient's plans and prove Detroit Steel's superiority over Iron Man. However, they failed, and Stark managed to save the event and even use it as a stunt to promote the repulsor car.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 #27|33}}

===Fear Itself===
[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Fear Itself Vol 1 4 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Stark breaking his sobriety]] 
During the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]]'s bid to rule Earth, Tony fought Mokk in the streets of Paris, [[France]], where all citizens had been turned into living statues. Finding himself unable to defeat [[Paul Duval (Earth-616)|Mokk]] with conventional methods, Tony entreated [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] to allow him to design magically powered weapons in the [[Furnaces of Nidavellir|forges]] of [[Nidavellir]].{{r|{{cl|Fear Itself Vol 1 4}}-[[Fear Itself Vol 1 5|5]]}}

Haunted by the casualties and his failure, Tony began drinking again. Odin appeared and after discussing with Tony, the All-Father proposed for him to create magical weapons at [[Nidavellir]]. Tony, determined not to fail again, restored his sobriety. With these weapons, the Avengers defeated the Serpent's [[The Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]] and [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Skadi]], while [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] defeated the Serpent himself but paid with his life. Days later, Tony destroyed the weapons at Nidavellir and after discussing with Odin, the god brought back to life the "statues" of the Parisians who weren't broken. Also, Stark offered the [[Dwarves of Nidavellir|Dwarf]] [[Splitlip (Earth-616)|Splitlip]] a place to work at Stark Resilient and to quit drinking.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 510}}

===Long Way Down===
A few days later, the Mandarin and Ezekiel Stane started deploying numerous revamped and upgraded villains of the Golden Avenger to make acts of wars over the world. The Mandarin also used a photo of Iron Man having his armor in short cut<!--???--> to manipulate the press into reporting that Tony Stark had been drunk, compromising Stark's image as an appropriate pilot of the armor, ultimately making the military force him install a device that allowed them to shut down the Iron Man armor when necessary.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 510}}{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 514}} Stark realized that he was being played by the Mandarin, so he came up with a counter-plan, which began with faking War Machine's death and resigning from being Iron Man.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 515}}

After Mandarin's plan led to a tragedy within Resilient, Stark contacted the villain to ask him what did he want. The Mandarin subsequently revealed he had been inside Tony's systems for a long time ago, and forced him to become his slave, making Tony build the [[Titanomech]]s with Ezekiel Stane at the [[Troy (Mandarin City)|Mandarin City]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 #520|521}}

Months later, Stark and Stane had built three Titanomechs, where the Mandarin placed three of his rings.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 523}} Tony and Ezekiel convinced three of the Mandarin's prisoners, [[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Whirlwind]], [[Blizzard (Jim) (Earth-616)|Blizzard]] and [[Arthur Parks (Earth-616)|Living Laser]] to join him in a rebellion against their "master."{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 523}} Additionally, [[Stark Resilient (Earth-616)|Resilient]] was able to use the microbots known as the [[Swarm (Resilient)|Swarm]] to track down Tony's repulsor tech and find him.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 524}}

The tide of the battle against the Mandarin and the Titanomechs was turned in favor of Iron Man and his allies when the [[Triumph Division (Earth-616)|Triumph Division]] and the [[Dynasty (Earth-616)|Dynasty]] heeded Resilient's call for help. Resilient was also able to remotely use the Swarm to revamp Tony's systems, and give him control over the mist of microbots, which he weaponized to destroy the Titanomechs. Meanwhile, Stane had taken the Mandarin one-on-one and killed him.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 526}}

Stark returned to [[Seattle]], and after isolating himself in order to create new technologies and think about his life, he decided to take some time and clear his mind in the process by going to space.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 527}}

[[File:X-Men Legacy Vol 2 9 Many Armors of Iron Man Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Along the Guardians of the Galaxy]]
===The Secret Origin of Tony Stark===
When Tony returned to Earth, he created [[Iron Man Armor Model 42|a new armor]] to test new technologies. After many aspects of his life were questioned upon defeating numerous people who got their hands on the [[Extremis virus]], Tony decided to accept an offer [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star Lord]] made to him and joined the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] to explore the universe.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 8}}{{r|{{cl|Iron Man Vol 5 1}}-[[Iron Man Vol 5 5|5]]}}{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 1}}

During his voyage in space, Tony Stark was faced by a rogue [[Rigellian Recorder]] called [[Recorder 451 (Earth-616)|451]], who claimed he had met [[Howard Stark (Earth-616)|Tony's father]], and was the one responsible decades ago for allowing to Tony be born. The Recorder revealed he had supposedly genetically engineered Tony in-womb, providing him with his intelligence and wits, and also that he modified Tony to let him be the only future pilot of a giant armor called [[Godkiller Armor|Godkiller]] which would be the nuclear deterrent of Earth.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 #9|12}} Tony was forced into piloting the Godkiller, but somehow couldn't.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 14}} 451 discovered his long-time plan had no profit, and decided to destroy his consciousness along with the Godkiller.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 15}} Tony managed to escape from the Godkiller with the brain-dead body of 451.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 16}}

Upon returning to Earth, Tony investigated why he couldn't pilot the Godkiller, and discovered the hidden secret that he wasn't the baby 451 modified at all, but an adopted son used as a decoy to prevent 451 from finding the actual boy. Tony finally located his long-time secret adoptive brother, [[Arno Stark (Earth-616)|Arno Stark]], who was no longer in danger as 451 was now dead. Reunited with his genius brother, Tony decided he could use the millennial information stored in 451's database and the intellect of Arno to help build a better world.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 17}}

===Superior Iron Man===
During a confrontation against the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Skull]], who was empowered by Charles Xavier's brain, the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom cast an inversion spell to alter the moral axis of Skull's mind in order to defeat him. The spell was successful and the Skull was beaten, but it also affected the moral compass of those present in the scene, unleashing the inner evilness and selfishness of numerous heroes.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 3}} A reinversion spell with the purpose of getting everything back to normal would later be cast, but Tony would avoid it using a special shielding to escape the spell.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 9}}

Once again egocentric and determined, Iron Man relocated to [[San Francisco]], where he secretly infected the entire city with a dormant new version of the [[Extremis virus]] via the water supply, to make the achievement of perfection available for everyone in the city. Using an "Extremis 3.0 app" for phones, the virus could be triggered inside an individual, giving the impression that the virus was downloadable.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 4}}{{r|Superior Iron Man Vol 1 4}} However, his plan had a second phase. After a month of free Extremis, he started charging each user of his Extremis App $99.99 a day for the renovation of this technology.{{r|Superior Iron Man Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Superior Iron Man Vol 1 1 Çinar Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Superior Iron Man]]

After a multitude of battles with several heroic figures, including Daredevil, Pepper Potts, and [[Anthony Stark (First A.I.) (Earth-616)|an artificial intelligence copy of an earlier, non-inverted version of his mind]], and the ally-turned-enemy [[Jamie Carlson (Earth-616)|Teen Abomination]], Tony's utopian vision for San Francisco fell through on account of a public relations campaign run by Pepper that destroyed the faith that the San Franciscans had in him, vilified Extremis 3.0, and revealed Tony Stark as "the monster [he'd] become," forcing him to work without his friends if he even wanted to secure his vision.{{r|Superior Iron Man Vol 1 #2|9}}

===Time Runs Out===
Some time before his space journey, Tony and the rest of the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] reassembled to investigate a newly-surfaced threat known as [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]], occurrences in which universes collided with their respective planet Earths as the focal point, and the only way to prevent the death of one's own Earth was to destroy the other. Because of this, the Illuminati had to prepare themselves for the prospect of killing an innocent planet for survival.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 1}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 2}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 7}} In order to ensure that threats of lesser importance could be handled accordingly so the Illuminati could focus on the incursions, Tony revamped and expanded the Avengers into a multi-purpose versatile unit. Tony additionally constructed a Dyson Sphere called [[Sol's Hammer]] in order to weaponize the Sun, and helped reverse-engineer the [[Antimatter Injection System]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 28}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 4}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 6}} The futility of their efforts to tackle the incursions and the necessity to hide their knowledge of it from the rest of the world took an emotionally toll on Tony, to the point the Illuminati's ally [[Yabbat Ummon Turru (Earth-1365)|Black Swan]] described him a "man coming to the end of himself."{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 18}}

Early into the incursion crisis, Captain America had denounced the acceptance of his fellow Illuminati of the prospect of destroying other worlds. His teammates wiped his memory from any knowledge about the incursions,{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 3}} but Rogers re-learned about them after being exposed to the explosion of the [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Watcher]]'s eye, which revealed to everyone caught in its blast deep secrets pertinent to each person.{{r|Original Sin Vol 1 3}} Steve confronted Iron Man about it,{{r|Avengers Vol 5 29}} and declared the Illuminati public enemies.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 34}}

At this point, Iron Man had been affected by the inversion spell. An attempt at reclaiming Wakanda from the [[Cabal (Namor's) (Earth-616)|Cabal]] that [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] had created to destroy incursive Earths resulted in Tony being held captive in the Necropolis.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 26}} After the Cabal had been apparently killed following a truce made by S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Illuminati, the Illuminati returned to Necropolis and freed Tony, who was forced to flee due to the Illuminati's unwillingness to let Stark be there with them when they met Rogers and the Avengers, to prevent old fires from being stoked.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 40}}

[[File:Avengers Vol 5 44 page 36.jpg|thumb|left|Iron Man vs. Steve Rogers, at the end of the Marvel Universe.]]
When the [[Shi'ar]] and their allies arrived at Earth in order to destroy it, as it was the focal point of the Multiverse's decay, the Avengers and the Illuminati tried to retaliate against the enemy fleet. However, they failed. As they ran out of options, Iron Man flew to [[Sol's Hammer]] in order to use it.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 43}}

Iron Man successfully destroyed the Shi'ar fleet, saving the Earth, but the final incursion was on the horizon. With only a few minutes before the event, Steve confronted Tony to settle up. The ensuing fight between the two old friends led Steve to force Tony to admit that he had lied to him and all of their allies, when he had known about the incursions all along, but Tony also confessed that he wouldn't change a thing. The final incursion started, and [[Earth-1610]]'s planet Earth started approaching Earth-616's planet Earth while Tony and Steve kept fighting. Earth-1610's S.H.I.E.L.D. launched a full invasion to destroy Earth-616, and Tony and Steve were crushed by a Helicarrier.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 44}} The two Earths ultimately collided, destroying each of the universes.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 1}}

===The Second Civil War===
When the Prime Universe was brought back to existence, any sign of Tony's moral inversion disappeared, having returned to his normal self. Eight months into the future, Tony made an unlikely ally in the allegedly reformed [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Victor von Doom]] during an adventure investigating the returned Madame Masque.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 1}} Doom became a key player in Masque's defeat{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 5}} and continued supporting Stark, much to Tony's skepticism.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 6}}

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) and Amanda Armstrong (Earth-616) from International Iron Man Vol 1 7 001.jpg|thumb|right|Reunited with his biological mother]]

Soon after, the super hero community was divided upon learning the existence of an [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] named [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses Cain]] who had the ability to profile the future. Tony opposed Captain Marvel's idea of actively using Ulysses' abilities to preemptively tackle any threats, suggesting it was dangerous to take his visions for granted for several reasons. The fact that it was possible to prevent the events Cain saw meant he didn't have access to anything set in stone, additionally, little was known about how Ulysses' powers worked, including their efficacy. Stark also brought into question the morality of stopping and punishing somebody for a disaster they could potentially cause, but might not even know they'd do.

Shortly after this first display of tensions between Captain Marvel's and Tony's ideals, Stark decided to begin a search on the identity of his biological parents. Once he ran into a dead end, Tony visited the orphanage in [[Sofia (Bulgaria)|Sofia]], Bulgaria where he had found he was adopted. Following a failed attempt to continue the research on his own that led Tony to re-encounter his old flame, Cassandra Gillespe, he was informed by the administrator of the orphanage about the discovery of hidden hospital records from Tony's mother, kept in secret by the former administrator after Tony's birth records had been taken with him. Stark learned that his biological mother was music producer Amanda Armstrong, and he met her.{{r|{{cl|International Iron Man Vol 1 1}}-[[International Iron Man Vol 1 7|7]]}}

Following the family reunion, the tension between Iron Man and Captain Marvel increased resulting from two different occasions when she heeded Ulysses' visions resulted in tragedy. First, War Machine died and She-Hulk was put in a coma during a preemptive ambush on [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]].{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 1}} Later, Bruce Banner was murdered by Hawkeye allegedly the split second before he was going to transform into the Hulk when Banner was being interrogated due to one of Cain's visions foreseeing him Hulking-out with catastrophic consequences.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) vs. Carol Danvers (Earth-616) from Civil War II Vol 1 8 002.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Iron Man vs. Captain Marvel]]

After Captain Marvel arrested an innocent finance banker named [[Alison Green (Earth-616)|Alison Green]] based on nothing more than a vision from Ulysses that turned out to be wrong, Iron Man enlisted the help of several super heroes who opposed profiling to attack the [[Triskelion]] and rescue Green.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 4}} The ensuing battle between Iron Man's and Captain Marvel's forces was cut short when a new vision announced Captain America's death at the hands of the new [[Spider-Man]] [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Miles Morales]] at the steps of the [[Capitol Building]].{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 5}} [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] subsequently deflected Captain Marvel's side publicly, giving Iron Man and his allies enough time to teleport away.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 6}}

Iron Man and Captain Marvel came to blows one last time after both Spider-Man and Captain America travelled to [[Washington, D.C.]] to prove the vision wrong.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 7}} Tony lost the fight and slipped into a coma, surviving solely due to secret alterations he had done to his body keeping him alive. His body was placed in a stasis pod in the Triskelion, where Beast set out to investigate his condition. Meanwhile, Ulysses' powers had evolved beyond the ability of human comprehension, and he left the Earth to join other cosmic entities.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 8}}

[[File:Amanda Armstrong (Earth-616) and Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 599 001.jpg|thumb|right|Tony approaching his mother]]

In the aftermath of Tony's fall, Victor von Doom decided to take up Iron Man's mantle in order to both help establish his new position as a hero and carry on Stark's legacy.{{r|Infamous Iron Man Vol 1 1}} A [[Anthony Stark (Third A.I.) (Earth-616)|digital copy]] of Stark's mind became active and located [[Riri Williams (Earth-616)|Riri Williams]], a prodigy teenager with affinity for suits of armor who had caught Tony's attention shortly before the war, in order to train her into becoming a hero.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 4 1}} At the request of Tony's will, Amanda Armstrong became the CEO of Stark Industries to prevent the company from falling to the hands of its board of directors.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 4 3}} Tony's comatose body was taken to the [[Stark Industries Industrial Complex (Dover)|Stark Industrial Complex]] in [[Dover (New Jersey)|Dover]],{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 593}} and it remained in a bio-restructuring pod until his body was reconstituted cell by cell, resulting in his sudden awakening. He disappeared from the Stark facility and went into hiding until he fully recovered, only approaching his mother once to ensure her he was safe.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 599}} In hopes it could turn out that Rhodey wasn't dead but in a similar state as he had woken up from, Tony exhumed his body from the [[Arlington National Cemetery|Arlington Cemetery]]. After performing the necessary procedures to kick-start Rhodey's biological system, Tony returned him to life. Rhodey joined Tony in fighting [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|The Hood]] to prevent Stark Industries from falling on his hands. Tony subsequently took down his own biological father, Jude, who had stepped out of the shadows after decades of keeping his resurrection at the hands of Hydra a secret.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 600}}

===Stark Unlimited===
Not long after making his return official, Tony rebranded his company as [[Stark Unlimited (Earth-616)|Stark Unlimited]], a think tank that doubled as an ideas incubator for new suits, turning Iron Man into a collaborative project, which additionally returned to the idea of creating a specific armor depending on the situation.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 1}} During this time, Iron Man rejoined the Avengers, marking the collective return of the Big Three — himself, Captain America and Thor — to the team.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 1|6}} Tony also reconnected with fellow founding member the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]], and started dating her.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 4}}

Despite his reinvigorated new lease on life, Tony was constantly haunted by the fear that he had lost his humanity due to the process that returned him, which reconstructed his body cell by cell.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 3}} Tony's worst fear was exacerbated when he was trapped inside a virtual world of his own making called the [[Project eScape|eScape]]. The eScape's rogue operating system named [[Mistress (Earth-616)|Motherboard]] claimed to have discovered that there was no genetic trace of the original Tony Stark in Tony's body.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 9}} Additionally, while brainwashed by Motherboard, Tony started drinking again,{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 8}} and his rekindled urge to drink carried over to the real world when he broke free from the digital nightmare.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 11}}

After becoming merged with his own [[Iron Man Armor Model 65|armor]] on a molecular level during confrontation against Ultron,{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 16}} Tony used a remotely-piloted [[Iron Man Armor Model 58|Nano-Iron Man Armor]] to venture into his own body to reverse the damage, and found microscopic manufacturing labels stamped in his very own cells.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 18}} Because of this, Tony became convinced that he was an artificial being, and a simulation of the real, late Tony Stark. Following Ultron's defeat, Tony's brother Arno laid claim to Stark Unlimited, arguing that since the bio-restructuring pod used to create Tony's new body was of his design, Tony was of his property, as well as everything that belonged to him. Afterwards, Arno poured all of his resources into creating his own [[Iron Man Armor Model 67|armor]], taking the mantle of Iron Man from Tony as well.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 19}}

===Robot Rebellion===
After disappearing from the public eyes for weeks, Stark fully embraced his identify as an artificial intelligence. Donning a recreation of his Model 1 Armor, Tony adopted the identity of Mark One and became the secretive leader of the [[A.I. Army (Earth-616)|A.I. Army]], a counter-movement of artificial life forms such as robots and androids fighting against rising oppression. Tony helped the A.I. Army and other robots hide from prosecution through the [[Thirteenth Floor]], a solid-light construct hideout.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 1}}

[[File:Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|As Mark One]]

The A.I. Army's liberation efforts were regularly countered by Arno, who became the premier force of A.I. oppression. Tensions came to a head when Arno intended to globally broadcast a software patch to make any robot inflected with it subservient, forcing Tony to come directly to blows against his brother.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 2}} During this confrontation, Arno revealed to Tony that he intended to band together humanity and robotkind in order to fight a non-existent looming threat called the [[Extinction Entity (Earth-616)|Extinction Entity]], a delusion caused by Arno's relapsing illness. Tony refused to believe Arno's claims, and the encounter ended with Tony plummeting to his death after managing to disable the broadcast.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 3}} Seconds before hitting the ground, Tony's consciousness was pulled from his body into the Thirteenth Floor by his ally A.I. [[Friday Stark (Earth-616)|Friday]].

While Tony was coming to terms with his identity and ultimately desisted from the idea that he wasn't the real Tony Stark,{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 4}} his allies took his body to the [[Stark Unlimited HQ]] and used genetic material obtained from both of Tony's parents in combination with a bio-pod to fully restore his body, doing away with any artificial cell replacements. After downloading his consciousness back into his body, Tony took his allies to the [[Stark Space Station]] to stop Arno's new plan to mentally control humanity instead of robots. Using his new [[Iron Man Armor Model 68|Virtual Armor]], Tony overwhelmed his brother.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 5}} Coming to the realization that he couldn't convince Arno that the Extinction Entity wasn't real before he could enslave humanity, Tony used the Virtual Armor to submerge Arno into a virtual dream in which the Extinction Entity was real and he managed to defeat it, also turning the suit into a life support system to prolong Arno's life. With robot oppression waning, Tony managed to take control back of his life, and reclaimed the mantle of Iron Man.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 6}}

===Books of Korvac===
Driven by a desire to escape from the baggage of his previous years, Stark resigned from the board of Stark Unlimited to embark on a journey of self-discovery. Moving away from his high-tech lifestyle and also breaking up with Wasp, Tony settled in a [[Tony Stark's Brownstone|brownstone]] in Manhattan and began donning a retro-inspired Iron Man armor to take a hands-on approach in doing good in the world. He was quickly joined by his former Avengers acquaintance [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 1}} who helped Tony take the right steps in his new approach to life and became his crime-fighting partner.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 2}}

When the recipient of Stark's latest investment turned out to be the returned android [[Michael Korvac (Earth-691)|Korvac]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 3}} Iron Man and Hellcat found themselves locked in a pursuit to stop the villain from regaining his godhood, and in the process became romantically involved.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 4}} Assembling a ragtag team of heroes,{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 5}} Iron Man and Hellcat took chase for Korvac to outer space to stop the android from reaching ''[[Worldship (Taa II)|Taa II]]'', the worldship of [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]], to regain his omnipotence. Tony allowed Korvac to show him the utopia he planned to create, when both Patsy and Tony rejected Korvac's vision, he lashed out at them and Tony was transported by a blue beam of light to an unknown planet.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 7}}

On the planet Iron Man met the inhabitants of a space colony called [[Megiddo (Space Colony)|Megiddo]], created by [[Wilbur Day (Earth-616)|Stilt-Man]] and with a familiar face in [[Colin Richard (Earth-616)|Avro-X]]. Over the days he spent helping the colony, Iron Man discovered that the planet they were on was were the [[Ultimos (Race)|Ultimos]] originated, Tony eventually decided to stay and help the colony.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 10}}

| Personality             = {{Quote|I can create a world without war. I can make a world without alcohol or drugs. Without hate or jealousy. But then it wouldn't be the world we live in. Nothing would be learned, nothing would be gained. We wouldn't advance as a species.|[[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]|Avengers Vol 4 12}}

Tony Stark is, for the lack of a better word, complicated. During his early days of success, Stark was a man who only cared about fame and wealth. He had no sense of responsibility or humility, always rubbing his success in the faces of everyone he met.{{r|Original Sin Vol 1 3.2}} This all changed when he was captured by terrorists. After building the first Iron Man armor and escaping captivity, Stark realized the kind of person he really was, and engaged in a life of heroism to atone for his past mistakes.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 244}}

Plagued by many vices, Stark is prone to womanizing, pride, and, most of all, alcoholism. The latter was an addiction developed in big part due to Howard's abuse of Tony, who forced him to take his first sip when he was a child.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 313}}{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 500.1}} This lifetime of troubles has caused him to develop a cynical view of the world.

Despite this, Stark is devoted to truly make the world a better place.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 7}} This desire has sometimes caused Stark to resort to morally questionable methods, as long as the end justifies them, including his crusade to safeguard his technology (leading him to confront heroes such as Stingray and the Captain), and the superhuman Civil War, during which Iron Man was hell bent on implementing the Superhuman Registration Act, because its failure would have led to a harsh response from the government.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 #225|232}}{{r|Civil War Vol 1 #1|7}} However, Iron Man has shown to be ridden by guilt over this type of course of action, which has developed into self-hate.{{r|Civil War: The Confession Vol 1 1}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 18}}{{r|Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic Vol 1 13}}{{r|Iron Man Annual Vol 2 1}} Tony Stark has been described as "man enough to do what needs to be done, even knowing full well what it will cost him."{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 542}} Stark's self-hating tendencies have also led to Stark being suicidal,{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 7}}{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 507}} and undervaluing his own life, specially in favor of others'.{{r|Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic Vol 1 13}}{{r|Avengers Vol 3 70}}{{r|Captain America Vol 6 6}}

According to Reed Richards, Tony Stark is "a future man trapped in the now. A prisoner raging against the slow crawl of human evolution." Stark's relationships, morality and ethics are highly adaptable and malleable to what he would consider the greater good of mankind's necessary survival and progress.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 43}} Tony has also been described as "[A person who] really cares. He's been on the top and he's been on the bottom and he's done all 12 steps and a few more. He knows what it's like to have a habit that eats you from the inside, like worms. And he knows there's no easy answer, but every solution to every problem has to start somewhere. He's just trying to help."{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 51}}

Tony has also been shown to loathe taking other people's lives, and resorting to killing people only as a extreme measure,{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 6}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 4}} and explicitly stating he doesn't kill,{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 4}} and having claimed that's "not the way we work."{{r|War Machine Vol 2 9}}

Iron Man is a hero that relies on his intellect and technological resources to defeat foes and achieve victory. Stark invariably prides himself on being one of the most intelligent people of the Marvel Universe.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 325}}

===Alcoholism===
{{Quote|Of course I want [a drink], that's what being an alcoholic is all about. Alas, that '''also''' means I can't have one.|[[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]|Iron Man Vol 5 1}}

Still a child, Tony was introduced to alcohol by Howard, when his adoptive father forcibly gave Tony his first drink while inebriated.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 313}} As a teenager, Tony would drink frequently starting when he was fifteen years old, mainly to allow himself to better fit in with his classmates and to impress girls.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 500.1}} As a young adult, Tony even worked under the influence of alcohol, claiming to have made groundbreaking work while drunk.{{r|Original Sin Vol 1 3.2}}

During his adulthood, Tony increased his frequency of drinking once S.H.I.E.L.D. threatened to buy his company, and his armor malfunctioned.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 120}} Stark's increasingly irresponsible behavior, including handling his Iron Man armor drunk and mistreating his butler and friend [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Edwin Jarvis]], led him to finally ask [[Bethany Cabe (Earth-616)|Bethany Cabe]] for help, who would help him fight his alcoholism for the first time.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 128}}

Due to the machinations of Obadiah Stane, Stark relapsed. He got replaced by [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|Rhodey]] as Iron Man{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 169}} and got kicked off the Avengers. Stark's condition worsened, and he became homeless. After the death of Tony's drinking partner [[Gretl Anders (Earth-616)|Gretl Anders]] on his arms on a cold night after she gave birth, Tony found a new appreciation for life, and he finally asked for Rhodey to help him overcome his addiction.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 182}} Weeks later, Stark re-assumed the mantle of Iron Man.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 200}}

By the time of the [[Heroic Age (Event)|Heroic Age]], he managed to stay sober until his meeting with Odin during the [[Fear Itself|Serpent War]].{{r|Fear Itself Vol 1 4}} Despite this, he was able to stay sober and control his drinking the following months.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 #510|527}} During an [[Glossary:Incursion|incursion]] he believed was going to destroy the Earth, Tony decided to line up numerous shots of alcoholic beverages and managed not to touch them, as even if he couldn't save the world, he wanted to "beat" his addiction.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 23}} Due to the casting of an "inversion spell" during [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]], Tony's moral compass became inverted, and his changed personality caused him to re-indulge in his alcoholism, apparently to "make up for wasted time" of sobriety.{{r|Superior Iron Man Vol 1 1}}

After the effects of the inversion spell were somehow reverted, Tony went back to abstinence,<ref group="note">{{cl|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 1}} shows Tony drinking a non-alcoholic beverage in contrast to [[Amara Perera (Earth-616)|Amara Perera]]'s champagne. In a similar manner, {{cl|Civil War II Vol 1 1}} shows Tony making a toast with a can of soft drink.</ref> and continued attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings when he felt it was necessary.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 14}}

During a crisis involving a virtual reality of Tony's creation named the [[Project eScape|eScape]], Tony was abducted and brainwashed by the eScape's rogue A.I. [[Mistress (Earth-616)|Motherboard]]. Motherboard reverted Tony's personality to his younger years, causing him to drink again.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 8}} Tony eventually broke free from Motherboard's grasp, but his renewed urge to drink carried into the real world.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 11}} With the help of his friends, Tony managed to abstain from drinking.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 14}} However, with the revelation that he was seemingly only a copy of the real, late Tony Stark following his return from a coma, Tony appeared to have given in to the drinking urge he had been fighting since breaking out of the eScape.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 19}}

===Relationships===
Tony has been in relationships with [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Pepper Potts]],{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 55}} [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]],{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 52}} [[Bethany Cabe (Earth-616)|Bethany Cabe]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 117}} [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]],{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 10}} [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]],{{r|Civil War Vol 1 3}} [[Giuletta Nefaria (Earth-616)|Madame Masque]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 18}} [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Janet Van Dyne]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 224}}{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 4}} [[Anna Wei (Earth-616)|Anna Wei]],{{r|Iron Man Annual Vol 1 2001}} [[Janice Cord (Earth-616)|Janice Cord]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 22}} [[Rumiko Fujikawa (Earth-616)|Rumiko Fujikawa]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 4}} [[Meredith McCall (Earth-616)|Meredith McCall]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 28}} [[Joanna Nivena (Earth-616)|Joanna Nivena]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 244}} [[Su Yin (Earth-616)|Su Yin]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 275}} [[Marianne Rodgers (Earth-616)|Marianne Rodgers]],{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 40}} [[Veronica Benning (Earth-616)|Veronica Benning]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 309}} [[Rae LaCoste (Earth-616)|Rae LaCoste]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 223}} [[Sunset Bain (Earth-616)|Sunset Bain]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 19}} [[Indries Moomji (Earth-616)|Indries Moomji]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 163}} [[Calista Hancock (Earth-616)|Calista Hancock]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 42}} [[Kathleen Dare (Earth-616)|Kathy Dare]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 233}} [[Brie Daniels (Earth-616)|Brie Daniels]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 225}} [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|Jennifer Walters]],{{r|She-Hulk Vol 2 17}} [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]],{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 4}} [[Tamara Robinson (Earth-616)|Tamara Robinson]],{{r|Iron Man: Legacy Vol 1 9}} and [[Heather Glenn (Earth-616)|Heather Glenn]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 171}}

| Powers                  = Tony Stark currently possesses no biological enhancements. At one point he had gained superhuman abilities due to interactions with certain types of technologies, namely the [[Extremis virus]], but they have become inaccessible ever since.

{{Navigation
| title = Former Powers
| body  = 
'''[[Extremis virus]]:''' After being fatally wounded by an [[Mallen (Earth-616)|Extremis-enhanced terrorist]], Tony Stark had to inject himself with the Extremis virus in order to survive.{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 4}} His entire body has also been enhanced by the techno-organic Extremis virus which granted him enhanced senses, reflexes, and regenerative healing.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 5}} He reprogrammed the serum to help him have better connection and control over his Iron Man armor, effectively making him Iron Man "inside and out."{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 5}} These enhancements were lost during the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], because when all the Stark technology was attacked, the Extremis conduit that linked him to the suit failed too.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 8}} These abilities included:
*'''Technopathic Link:''' The Extremis virus allowed Stark to super compress and store the crucial undersheath needed to operate the Iron Man suit in the hollows of his bones, which was directly wired into his brain. This upgrade allowed him to control the [[Iron Man Armor Model 29|Iron Man armor]] with thought, like it was another limb. He had direct cyber pathic control over the communication devices, scanning equipment, and recording devices located in his helmet.{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 5}}
**'''Electronic Communication:''' Using his connection to the Iron Man armor, Stark could remotely access to external communications systems such as satellites, cellular phones, and computers throughout the world. Stark was capable of projecting his voice through transmitting sound systems such as cellular phones via electronic transmissions from his central nervous system.{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 5}}
*'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' The Extremis virus granted him enhanced speed reactions and movements.{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 6}}
*'''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Stark had gained a regenerative healing factor, allowing him to heal himself. Stark had regenerated from the damage caused by Mallen.{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 6}}
*'''Enhanced Endurance:''' The Extremis virus was mentioned to have increased Tony's natural endurance.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 25}}
*'''Significantly Enhanced Brain Function:''' With the Extremis virus, Tony's brain function greatly increased, allowing him to process information and connect data together like a supercomputer. As Tony's brain thought processes were still at a standard level, this was shown to cause hallucinations which provided him with information that his conscious mind was unable to keep up with.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 25}}
*'''Modified Physiology:''' The Extremis virus changed Stark's body to the point it allowed him to augment the way his insides worked to suit his needs. For example, Stark had grown wires in his lungs.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 21}}
*'''Nanotech Armor Manipulation:''' Due to the Extremis, Tony could store the nanoparticles of his suit within the hollows of his bones and summon it at will. He could also command the nanoparticles to reshape and even repair itself.{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 6}}
[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Fear Itself Vol 1 7.3 001.jpg|thumb|right|Stark using the R.T. node to project energy at will]]
'''[[Arc Reactor|R.T. node]]:''' Thanks to the Repulsor Tech node implanted in his chest, which is linked to his brain, Tony was able to interact with different types of energies and forces a normal human cannot. The R.T. node acted like a new sense for him.<ref group="note" name="R.T. node">Based on [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Pepper Potts]]' experience with a similar R.T. node to Stark's in {{cl|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 4}}</ref> The reactor's excessive generation of energy provided Stark with an increased amount of intelligence and gave him superhuman-level multitasking and learning capabilities. It enhanced his metabolism, core strength, reaction time, reflexes and intelligence up to 25-30 IQ points.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 8}} After a [[Secret Wars|world-ending event]] that reshaped reality, Stark no longer appeared to use the R.T. node.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 1}}<ref group="note" name="AoS">In addition to not having appeared with the R.T. node in ''Invincible Iron Man'', lettered pages of {{cl|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 1}} showed any signs of Stark's R.T. node digitally removed when compared to the unlettered previews for the same pages, meaning the absence of the R.T. node in Stark's other appearances post-''Secret Wars'' not to be a mistake</ref>
* '''Energy Emanation:''' The R.T. node not only provided repulsor energy to run devices such as the Iron Man Armor, its user could produce beams of energy at will, possibly weaker and less directed than a unibeam.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 521}}
* '''Electrical Fields Detection:''' As the R.T. node was connected to Tony, he could feel different electrical fields that the node was picking up. This included all kinds of invisible frequencies.<ref group="note" name="R.T. node"/>
* '''Magnetic Force-Field:''' The R.T. node created a force-field which could be modified at will by its user by increasing the power of the reactor incrementally. It could be so powerful to destroy bullets or repel people.<ref group="note" name="R.T. node"/>
** '''Levitation:''' The magnetic force-field generated by the reactor couldn't interfere the ones created by the planet and levitate. It's unknown if this interaction could have been used to fly.<ref group="note" name="R.T. node"/>
* '''Enhanced Senses:''' The reactor also increased the senses of Tony, allowing him to "hear better," for example.<ref group="note" name="R.T. node"/>
* '''Enhanced Strength:''' The R.T. node allowed who possessed it to have a greater strength than a regular human's.<ref group="note" name="R.T. node"/>
* '''Enhanced Endurance:''' It has been shown that an user of an R.T. node not only recovers incredibly fast from different types of injuries.<ref group="note" name="R.T. node"/>

'''[[Extremis virus|Extremis 3.0]]:''' In the wake of the [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|"World War Hate"]], Tony Stark designed a new version of the [[Extremis virus]] and made it available for the public. He injected himself with it, and developed additional abilities. He appears to no longer possess its enhancements, which were the following:
* '''Enhanced Strength:''' He was able to lift Daredevil with one arm and throw him away with relative ease.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 6}}
* '''Enhanced Agility and Reflexes:''' Tony was able to react instantaneously to Daredevil's attacks and move quickly enough to avoid them.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 6}}
* '''Immortality and Regeneration:''' Tony claimed that Extremis 3.0 grants its host a form of immortality and rapid cell regeneration.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 6}}

'''Biological Enhancements:''' Tony Stark experimented on himself in secret for years to enhance his body. These mysterious upgrades were the only thing that prevented Tony from dying during a battle against [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]].{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 7}} When Tony's biological system rebooted itself and he woke up from a coma, these enhancements became lost.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 599}}
}}

| Abilities               = '''Super-Genius Intelligence:''' Quite apart from the powers granted him by the suit, Tony Stark is far more than a mechanical engineering prodigy who graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with honors at the age of 17.<ref>Iron Man: The Legend (1996)</ref> With an intelligence classified as super-genius,{{r|Avengers: Roll Call Vol 1 1}} he easily is one of the smartest people on Earth. Furthermore, this extends to his remarkable ingenuity dealing with difficult situations such as foes and deathtraps where he is capable of using his available tools, like his suit, in unorthodox and effective ways, for example when he built the first [[Iron Man Armor Model 1|Iron Man Armor]] in captivity.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 39}} He has also been able to hack technology from the [[Kree]], a race centuries more advanced than humans.{{r|Operation: Galactic Storm}}

Tony's genius allows him to act as a futurist, a person capable of intuiting the future based on current trends, to the point of foreshadowing that a situation like the [[Civil War|superhuman Civil War]] was going to happen years before it did.{{r|New Avengers: Illuminati Vol 1 1}} This ability also extends to a much smaller scale, with Tony being capable of predicting with accuracy the way an interaction with a given individual will go down even before talking with them, a faculty that makes it really hard for human interactions to surprise him,{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 7}} and causes him to sometimes finish other people's sentences.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 2 7}}

Stark can use his superior intellect to the levels of dividing his consciousness with the help of Stark Datashades and perfectly operate three portions of his consciousness at the same time, being able to move, fight, talk and process information in three different bodies at the same time.{{r|Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic Vol 1 7}} Tony has been mentioned by Reed Richards to be the world's best multitasker.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 43}}

[[File:Iron Man Vol 5 1 Hastings Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]
'''Master Engineer:''' He is an excellent engineer and mechanic capable of fixing almost any, if not all machinery.

'''Master Businessman:''' Stark is extremely well-respected in the business world, able to command people's attentions when he speaks on economic matters by virtue of the fact that he is savvy enough to have, over the years, built up several multi-million dollar companies from virtually nothing. He is known for the loyalty he commands from and returns to those who work for him, as well as his impeccable business ethics.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 89}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 103}} He also strives to be environmentally responsible in his businesses, and in one case, immediately fired an employee who made profitable (but illegal) sales to Doctor Doom. He states that if he wanted to, he could give away his entire fortune and build it up again within a week. Stark most notably turned his father's munitions firm into a multi-national corporation that covered virtually all contemporary scientific industry when barely in his early twenties.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 288}}

'''Master Tactician:''' He is a brilliant tactician capable of quickly formulating battle strategies and new plans if the situation changes, like being able to elaborate different complex plans in order to defeat different enemies in difficult situations,{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 4}}{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 516}} and be victorious. Even going as far as to simultaneously put Reed Richards in check on five different boards playing chess, a game he didn't learn until later in his life, leaving Richards totally astonished.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 4}}

'''Skilled Combatant:''' Stark was trained in unarmed combat by Captain America,{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 125}} Black Widow, Black Panther, and Shang-Chi,{{r|Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic Vol 1 12}} making him a quite physically formidable combatant on his own when the situation demands it. He has managed to fight [[Hammer Industries (Earth-616)|Hammer Industries]] guards,{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 125}} defeat five [[Skrull]] soldiers in single-handed combat,{{r|New Avengers: Illuminati Vol 2 1}} Stark Industries security guards,{{r|Iron Man vs. Whiplash Vol 1 3}} numerous [[Voldi]] gladiators,{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 7}} handle his own against [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Madame Hydra]],{{r|Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Annual Vol 1 1}} and bare-handedly confront several ninja.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 8}}

'''Skilled Marksman:''' Tony knows how to handle firearms, mainly the ones he has produced.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 116}}

'''[[Multilingual]]:''' Apart from English, Tony can speak different languages fluently, including Japanese,{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 12}}{{r|Avengers: Millennium Infinite Comic Vol 1 2}} Mandarin Chinese,{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 241}}{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 3}} French,{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 13}} Russian,{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 14}}{{r|Iron Man/Thor Vol 1 1}} and Korean.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 24}} He also might know multiple Middle Eastern languages, at one point noting that Urdu wasn't his strong suit in particular.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 18}}

| Strength                = Without his armor Tony Stark possesses a strength a little superior than that of a normal human, he also engages in moderate regular exercise. The armor amplifies Stark's strength to incalculable levels, enabling him to normally lift (press) roughly [[Strength Scale#100 Tons|100 tons]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 5}} If sufficiently powered by an outside source, the armor can achieve massively higher levels.

| Weaknesses              = '''Alcoholism''': While Tony has quit drinking, when he used to, Stark would occasionally operate the Iron Man armor while intoxicated, compromising his efficiency.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 128}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 168}} Now that he continues to struggle and avoid falling off the wagon, Tony's alcoholism has made him susceptible to the prospect of drinking, specially when under pressure.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 166}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 14}}

{{Navigation
| title  = Former Weaknesses
| body   = 
'''Constant Recharge''': Due to the shrapnel in his body, Iron Man must keep his suit charged at all times, often involving breaking away from a fight to recharge otherwise he would die. Although the shrapnel was later removed eliminating this weakness.

'''Memory Problems''': Due to his recent memory deletion and the procedure that restored him, Tony Stark can no longer remember certain points of his life and the simplest things like how to tie a tie due to the process' side-effects being greater than it was initially predicted.

'''R.T. Node Dependence''': The [[Arc Reactor|Repulsor Tech node]] implanted in Stark's chest had the basic machine codes to keep Stark's Extremis-modified body working. So it needed to be in constant connection with him. After a [[Secret Wars (2015 Event)|world-ending event]] that reshaped reality, Stark no longer appeared to use the R.T. node.

'''Psychic Resonance Dampener''': Based on Shi'ar technology, this anklet inhibited Stark's ability to access his Extremis abilities for a time. It was provided to him by Doc Samson when SHIELD believed he was becoming unhinged during his investigation of Gadget's demise.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 23|26}}
}}

| Equipment               = '''[[Avengers Identicard]]'''

'''[[Iron Man Armor|Armor]]:''' Iron Man wears a sophisticated suit of body armor containing various offensive weaponry. He has a number of suits aside from the current model. Some are mission-specific or prototypes for testing, others are older models kept for nostalgia or for research. He has developed a special [[Iron Man's Briefcase|briefcase]] to carry his armor in. A few models are too big for the case and require a separate module. As the multi-billionaire head of a global corporation and a genius-level inventor, Stark can procure or develop additional technology as needed as possible.<!-- removed the outdated reference to SHIELD and DOD -->

===='''Iron Man Armor'''====
Iron Man's primary powers mostly come from his [[Iron Man Armor|armored suit]].

'''Suiting up the Iron Armor:''' Originally, Iron Man's armor was put on manually.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 39}}{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 48}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 192}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 218}} Since the [[Iron Man Armor Model 2|Model 2]] armor, the only parts needed to be snapped on his body were the torso, the arm-leg "adaptors" (the cuffs of the gloves and boots), the fingers and the back of the hands, and the boots' soles. Metallic meshes were pulled magnetically from the adaptors to the other sections of the armor in less than two seconds.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 48}} 

The [[Iron Man Armor Model 4|Model 4]] suit allowed for every section of the suit to be stored in the torso, with an ultrasonic signal proceeding from Stark's wristwatch and I.D. bracelet activating a polarizing unit in the chest-beam, which caused the shoulder and collar rings to expand in a 3D form, letting out the sleeve and leggings of the suit, which were expanded upon reaching the forearm and calves by memory circuits into the cuffs of the gloves and boots, and then encasing his hands and feet. Meanwhile, the mask slid over his head from behind. This process took micro-seconds.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 85}}

The [[Iron Man Armor Model 8|Model 8]] armor{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 200}} and later suits{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 229}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 300}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 1}} required again for the entire parts of the suit to be snapped on. The [[Iron Man Armor Model 16|Model 16]] armor was able to be stored compactly and fly towards Tony if necessary, quickly encasing him.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 16}}

The [[Iron Man Armor Model 19|Model 19]] armor had the mesh covering the entire body made of [[S.K.I.N.]], a liquid metal, automatically covering the entire body once the chest piece was placed on it. Gloves, boots and torso had to be put manually.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 45}}

After injecting himself with [[Extremis virus|Extremis]], Stark was able to store [[Iron Man Armor Model 29|his suit]]'s undersheath in the hallows of his bones, being able to make it cover his skin at will. A signal sent from the lockchip in his arm caused the rest of the pieces of the armor to be pushed towards Tony using vectored repulsor field,{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 5}} being able to equip his armor in "the blink of an eye."{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 3}}

After losing Extremis, Tony's new [[Iron Man Armor Model 37|Model 37]] armor was composed of neurokinetic user-controlled morphologic nanoparticle bundles that resided in Stark's body, and formed a fibrous wetweb of iron and platinum, that could be commanded to form any type of structure upon Stark's skin, from weaponry to clothing.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 30}} Once that armor was rendered inert and expelled from Stark's body, Tony used several machines to suit himself up.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 1}} The suit could also fly towards him and encase him incredibly fast.{{r|Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic Vol 1 9}}

After [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|being morally inverted]], Stark's new suit, made up of liquid smart-metal which hardened instantly on connection with the user's body, featured [[Symbiotes (Race)|symbiotic]] "building blocks," creating a psionic bond between the suit and Tony, allowing the armor's start-up to be completely psionic and not rely on tech.{{r|Superior Iron Man Vol 1 1}}

====='''Armor Capabilities'''=====
* '''''Superhuman Strength:''''' He's capable of lifting up to 100 tons when wearing his armor and can achieve higher levels of strength when powered by a sufficiently more powerful source. When She-Hulk got into a major frenzy, Tony was able to put her down in one punch.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 500}} His exact strength heavily depends on which armor he is currently wearing.

* '''''Superhuman Speed:''''' Even when not traveling for extended distances, the armor enables the wearer to move and react at very high speeds, shown for example when he was able to outmaneuver Spider-Man{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 14}} and the Human Torch.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 7}}

* '''''Flight:''''' The armor can typically reach speeds in excess of Mach 10, however Iron Man has been recently depicted as able to reach orbital escape velocities (5 miles per second) and up to speeds that can outrun black holes. Use of the jet boots provide enough power to lift a load of about 500 tons. Most recent suits are even able of reaching warp speed.{{r|Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic Vol 1 1}}

* '''''Power Cells:''''' Most of his armor are powered by a combination of solar converters, electrical batteries and an on-board generator that uses beta particle absorption as a fuel source. Current models after [[Iron Man Armor Model 37]] use a set of five [[Arc Reactor|Repulsor Tech generators]] to be powered.{{r|Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic Vol 1 1}}

* '''''Energy Conversion Power Recharge:''''' The armor is also able to absorb and convert nearby or far away energy sources, such as heat, solar, electrical, magnetic, geo-thermal or kinetic energy or energy from the planet itself into electricity, or even drain energy directly into the batteries for recharge.{{r|Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic Vol 1 1}}

* '''''Self-Contained Life-Support System & Environmental Protection:''''' The armor can be completely sealed for operations in vacuum or underwater, providing its own life support, and is shielded against radiation, biological, chemical, corrosive, kinetic, and electrical attacks as well. 

* '''''Magnetism:''''' The armor can generate magnetic fields to pull or push metal objects at will.

* '''''Anti-Magnetism:''''' The armor Tony has to negate the effects of magnetism on it. This skill is used often to be immune to the powers of [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]].{{r|AVX: Vs Vol 1 1}} This skill can be triggered when the armor picks next wave magnetism. 

* '''''Onboard Computer:''''' The armor has an internal on board computer operating system that aids Stark in providing strategies, background information on opponents, surroundings, the status of the suit, and prevents a lock on from targeting systems.

* '''''Sensor Array:''''' Known sensors include radar/lidar, night vision, and physiological/medical scanners that allow Stark to take and monitor the vitals of other people, including heart and brain scans. These scans also provide Stark with real-time personal physiological data. They are also capable of an all-environmental scan for atmospheric content or life forms--including astral energy projections. 

* '''''Override:''''' When required, armor systems including strength amplification, durability amplification, and repulsor intensity can be greatly increased, by bypassing safety circuits and limiters. However, there is a chance that this can result in a complete system failure of the armor. An example of this mode is when Iron Man easily lifted a 16,000 ton Nuclear Reactor, and flew into the sky and threw it into the sea. It seems that he utilized this resource on the Hulk once, as the armor ends up completely inert.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 132}} The range of the Override can be controlled as only reaching his very limit and staying at it for a long time will cause a system failure. This range goes from a safe 800% to 3200%, up to a very dangerous 5000%.

====='''Defensive Powers'''=====
'''Crystallized Iron Armor''': The armor has evolved from a bulky iron suit to a highly complex matrix of molecularly-aligned fully crystallized ultra high carbon iron/steel hybrid alloy enhanced by magnetic fields over layers of other ultra hyper alloys like titanium alloy and or tungsten/vanadium alloys reinforced with carbon nano-tubes creating a shell that is pliable, yet capable of amazingly high resilience and protection.

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Iron Man Vol 5 6 005.jpg|thumb|left|Iron Man's shield withstanding explosions]]
*'''''Enhanced Durability''''': His armor is very durable, capable of withstanding tremendous amounts of punishment. It can withstand high caliber bullets with ease. He can also withstand rockets, missiles, torpedoes, high powered lasers, and such, taking little to no damage. Future armor were fully resistant against electricity, fire, heavy impacts, energy blasts, take zero Kelvin and up to the Sun's temperatures, even some of Thor's attacks (see Thorbuster). The suit can withstand almost unlimited kinetic and thermal impact, as well as most forms of radiation thanks to its refractory coating. The armor can survive anything short of a nuclear explosion at ground zero. The suit automatically protects its wearer when he enters an intrinsically hostile environment, such as outer space or deep sea. The armor even has specialized circuitry that guards against telepathic attacks.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 9}} Tony is very confident in his suit's defensive abilities, when he was caught in a nuclear explosion, he was only thinking about women and completely forgot about what was happening around him.{{r|Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 32}}

* '''''Energy Shield:''''' Energy shielding that can protect the user from harm. It is also capable of reflecting attacks and staying mobile. At 2% power, the shield is strong enough to withstand a nuclear explosion. It is even capable of protecting its user at the point blank of a nuclear explosion caused by a material even more radioactive than Uranium, [[Phlogistone]].{{r|Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic Vol 1 1}} The suit's shielding can resist a force blast from the Spectral [[Mandarin's Rings|Mandarin Ring]], a beam of energy so powerful it can destroy the bonds between atoms and molecules,{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 24}} and magic.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 9}}

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Iron Man Vol 5 2 002.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Iron Man employs his repulsors.]]
* '''''[[Glossary:Repulsor|Repulsor Rays]]:''''' The armor's primary energy weapon. A particle beam weapon, standard equipment in the palm gauntlets; can repel physical and energy-based attacks, traveling as a single stream or as a wide-field dispersal. Beams possess penetrative strength ranging from effortlessly punching through 2 inches of steel to blasting a hole through a mountain. Power output can be adjust for larger beam or an omnidirectional, full-form repulsor blast. Power output can be adjusted to fire beams generating 2 gigawatts (like the Mark 3) to the beams in the high petawatt region, as seen with the Mark 27 (with assistance from outside sources). The latest version, the Mark IVa, was introduced with the [[Iron Man Armor Model 42]], featuring a red color.

* '''''Unibeam:''''' A powerful searchlight, capable of projecting beams in virtually every light spectrum. Also used as a powerful weapon that can destroy anything in its path. It fires a boosted form of the Monobeam with some energy backing it up. [[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Contest of Champions Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Unibeam]]
** '''''Tri-beam:''''' This unique version of the Unibeam runs on direct power from the chestplate, draining it's energy rapidly if not fully charged; causes considerable recoil.
** '''''Multi-beam:''''' As the name implies, the Multi-beam can fire multiple energies at the same time. Generally used with the energy that Tony Stark has absorbed.
** '''''Pentabeam:''''' The Pentabeam has microwave lensing projector that allows for directed beams of ultra-high multi mega-joule electrons, protons, acoustic energy, and neutrons.
** '''''Omnibeam:''''' Rather than only firing beam type attacks, the Omnibeam can generate heats at 25,232 degrees Fahrenheit, extremely powerful lights causing irreversible blindness in the enemy, and emit ultrasonic attacks capable of stunning even superhumanly durable foes and even causing disintegration. The other way the Omnibeam is fired is by absorbing or draining any energy in Iron Man's vicinity, drawing it into his chest reactor and converting it into billions of petawatts and firing it.

* '''''Lasers:''''' Standard lasers that can be used as weapons or for welding, including UV laser to penetrate light-permeable shields.[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) from Iron Man Vol 5 2 005.jpg|thumb|250px|Laser]]

* '''''Pulse Bolts:''''' Extremely powerful plasma discharges that propagate in strength over distance, but implode if they get overloaded.

* '''''Energy Blade:''''' Based on the same design Tony Stark used to build Captain America's energy shield, this laser sword, emitted from his right arm, could also be flattened into a shield on his hands, or spread over the entire armor to encase the armor in a protective covering.

* '''''Pulse Barrage''''' Pulse Barrage is one of Iron Man's standard long range attack. Because of its extremely low energy consumption, Pulse Barrage can be a very effective attack. an upgraded Red Pulse Barrage has the ability to penetrate through foes hitting others behind them, and the ability to ricochet off walls hitting more targets.

* '''''Smart Missiles:''''' The Smart Missile is one that can target the weak points of a structure, object, or foe to inflict maximum damage with a minimal payload.

* '''''Hyper-velocity Impact:''''' The program Hyper-velocity allows Tony to think and move at a much faster time frame than everyone else, allowing for quicker attacks. Also, it could create an electrical bubble if Tony is going fast enough.

* '''''Plasma Discharge:''''' A plasma discharge is given off when the suit comes into contact with Vibranium.

* '''Telepathic Microscopic Tasers:''' Tony created this device to prevent telepathic beings use its powers. They are stored in the armor's electric jet. One inhaled by a telepath, the more he/she tries to use his/her psychic powers, the higher is the voltage of an electric current released in his/her body. It can be lethal if the telepath doesn't stop trying to use his/her powers.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 2}}

* '''Telepathy Inhibitor:''' Tony's Iron Man armor is capable of blocking telepathic signals, even those of beings as powerful as the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Onslaught]].{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 1}}

'''[[Arc Reactor|Repulsor Tech node]]:''' The Repulsor Tech node is a type of fusion power which derived from the [[Repulsor|repulsor technology]] of the [[Iron Man Armor|Iron Man suit]] created by Tony. It can be used as a source for clean energy as well as a powerful bomb, further modifications made along Rand Industries discarding the second possible application. After being left in a coma in a battle against Norman Osborn, an arc reactor was used to run Stark's body once more by using it to run the basic machine codes to keep Stark's Extremis-modified body working, also providing Stark with an increased intelligence, multitasking abilities and additional powers.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 25}} After [[Secret Wars (2015 Event)|the destruction and rebirth of the universe]], he lost the necessity to use the R.T. node when he came back to life.<ref group="note" name="AoS"/>
}}
| Transportation          = When not traveling in his armor or using a [[Quinjet]] as an Avenger, Stark owns a number of vehicles. Some of them have been modified, such as a Ferrari capable of flight.
| Weapons                 = Various repulsor weapon systems by Iron Man armor.

| Notes                   = * The place of Tony Stark's origin as [[Iron Man]] has been subject to changes over the years since his first appearance in 1963 due to the effects of Marvel's [[Glossary:Sliding Timescale|Sliding Timescale]]. Originally in {{cl|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 39}}, it was in [[Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. This was maintained in several retellings (namely {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 1}}, {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 47|#47}}, {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 68|#68}}, {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 122|#122}}, and {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 144|#144}}). The explicit mention of Vietnam and the Vietnam War was first omitted in 1985's {{cl|Weapons Locker Vol 1 1}}, which only mentions Tony becoming Iron Man in Southeast Asia after being taken prisoner by communist insurgents. In {{cl|Marvel Saga the Official History of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 6}}, a year later, the location became a now-unspecified Southeast Asian country. For the most part, the location remained ambiguous for decades, with the exception of 2002's {{cl|Iron Man Vol 3 50}} implying that it was Vietnam again (but not during the Vietnam War), with Stark mentioning that the conflict he was caught on had sparked "before the stink of Agent Orange had faded away." [[wikipedia:Agent Orange|Agent Orange]] was a chemical agent used during the Vietnam War by the American military. The biggest deviation in the setting of Iron Man's origin to date was presented in 2004's {{cl|Iron Man Vol 4 1}}, which took the setting from the Southeast Asian jungle to the Middle Eastern desert, in [[Afghanistan]] specifically. This continued in 2009's {{cl|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 18}}, in which Stark revisits the cave in Afghanistan where he first became Iron Man. However, 2019's {{cl|History of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 2}} established that Stark's kidnapper [[Wong-Chu (Earth-616)|Wong-Chu]] had operated in the fictional [[Sin-Cong|Siancong]] (located in Southeast Asia) during the [[Siancong War]]. While the main story of {{cl|History of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 3}} didn't specify if Stark was kidnapped there, only mentioning that he was captured in Asia, the issue's ''Annotations'' feature did establish that Stark became Iron Man in Siancong.
* The reason for Stark's visit to the location where he became Iron Man has also changed over the years. In ''Tales of Suspense'' #39, it was to supervise the implementation of his micro-transistors on miniaturized American weaponry during the Vietnam War. In ''Iron Man'' #144, the new weapons for the military that Tony was testing were enhanced by his "theories of reverse magnetism." ''Marvel Saga the Official History of the Marvel Universe'' #6 mentioned again the transistor-powered miniaturized artillery, but the Vietnam War was effectively wiped from Iron Man's origin, with a secret mission against communists in power being the reason for Stark's visit. While the ambiguity of the location was maintained in {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 244}}, this issue again placed Iron Man's origin during an active armed conflict, and it only mentioned that Stark was in the battlefield to test a new weapon. {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 267}} presented the biggest change to the reason for Stark's visit. In this issue, he visits Southeast Asia to investigate a disruption in the supply chain to his factory in the region (secretly orchestrated by the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]] as a lure), and there is no involvement of the American military. {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 288}} additionally establishes that Tony decided to take personal interest in the problems at his overseas plant out of boredom. The angle of Tony being on a visit during an armed conflict was used again in {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 319}} and {{cl|Age of Innocence: The Rebirth of Iron Man Vol 1 1}}. {{cl|Iron Man: The Iron Age Vol 1 1}} and {{cl|Iron Man Vol 3 1}} returned to the reason for Stark's visit being a disruption in the supply chain, before going back to the context of the armed conflict in {{cl|Iron Man Vol 3 31}}. In {{cl|Iron Man Vol 3 50}}, the conflict was a "secret war" against the drug trade. In this issue, Stark had been enlisted to build a reinforced battle armor for soldiers, and visited the war zone to fix a design glitch in the suits. In ''Iron Man'' (Vol. 4) #1, Stark visits the location of his kidnapping (changed to Afghanistan) as a consultant to help the military look at ways to contain [[Al-Qaeda (Earth-616)|Al-Qaeda]]. {{cl|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 593}} simply states that Stark was on a weapons demonstration. The ''Annotations'' feature of ''History of the Marvel Universe'' (Vol. 2) #3 favors the version of Iron Man's origin story in which he was visiting one of his plants before being kidnapped.
* Other details surrounding Iron Man's origin have varied over the decades. For instance, in ''Tales of Suspense'' #39, after Stark sets off a booby trap that fatally injuries him and kills the squadron escorting him, Wong-Chu's guerilla finds him alive and takes him in since they expect him to be somebody important. Wong-Chu only learns who Stark is after confiscating documents in his possession, and orders him to build him weaponry with [[Ho Yinsen (Earth-616)|Yinsen]]. ''Iron Man'' #267 and {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 268|#268}} greatly alter the narrative behind Stark's kidnapping; under the orders of the Mandarin, Wong-Chu lures Stark to Southeast Asia by disrupting the supply chain of one of his factories. Stark is ambushed by Wong-Chu's guerilla and is injured by one of Wong's booby traps that is detonated by his companion [[Toshiro Kanada (Earth-616)|Toshiro Kanada]], who dies in the process. Stark is then paired with Yinsen to unlock the power of the [[Mandarin's Rings]], and Wong-Chu has them work on making weapons to stall until the Mandarin gave them their true assignment, but Stark escapes before that happens. {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 319}} established for the first time that the mine which injured Tony was manufactured by [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark International]]. Later retellings like in ''Iron Man'' (Vol. 3) #50 don't outright undo the Mandarin's involvement, but don't include him. This issue also explicitly contradicts the notion that the booby trap that injured Tony was one of Wong-Chu's, but rather a leftover from "an all-but-forgotten war." In ''Iron Man'' (Vol. 4) #1, Stark and the military are ambushed by the [[Taliban (Earth-616)|Taliban]], and Tony is fatally injured when gunfire detonates a landmine which was part of the military's cargo that was in proximity to him. When it continues in {{cl|Iron Man Vol 4 5}}, this origin also omits the involvement of Wong-Chu. In {{cl|Invincible Iron Man Annual Vol 1 1}}, Wong-Chu is replaced by [[Raza (Earth-616)|Raza]] and the Mandarin is once again explicitly involved, but Stark's kidnapping isn't planned; the Mandarin actually encourages Raza to kill him instead of keeping him prisoner. Both {{cl|Black Widow Vol 6 6}} and {{cl|History of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 2}} later brought back Wong-Chu. The ''Annotations'' feature of ''History of the Marvel Universe'' (Vol. 2) #3 favors the version of Iron Man's origin story in which he was injured by a landmine during capture.
* The specific place of Stark's confinement while kidnapped has also changed in recent years. From ''Tales of Suspense'' #39 and even after the location of his kidnapping was changed to Afghanistan, Tony was held captive in a shack at a small settlement. Starting with 2009's {{cl|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 18}}, the setting was changed to a cave, and this modification was reflected in later comics like ''Invincible Iron Man Annual'' #1, {{cl|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 500.1}}, ''Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic'' #3, {{cl|Iron Man Annual Vol 2 1}} and ''Invincible Iron Man'' #593. In these last five issues mentioned, the device keeping Stark's heart beating during captivity is changed. Rather than an entire chestplate, Tony is shown having an [[Arc Reactor|arc reactor]] implanted on his chest.
** The inclusion of Raza as one of Stark's kidnappers, the place of confinement being a cave and Tony wearing an arc reactor rather than a full chestplate were inspired by the origin story of [[Anthony Stark (Earth-199999)|Iron Man]] in the [[Earth-199999|Marvel Cinematic Universe]] from 2008's ''[[Iron Man (film)|Iron Man]]'' film.
* Tony wouldn't cover up his secret identity by claiming Iron Man was his bodyguard until several issues after his first appearance. He initially claimed that Iron Man was simply a close friend of his, who happened to be close by whenever he needed to be in action.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 44}}{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 45}} The first person to suggest Iron Man worked for Tony Stark was [[Gregor Shapanka (Earth-616)|Gregor Shapanka]] when he found himself cornered by the Golden Avenger brief moments after attacking the Stark Industries vault, but Iron Man awkwardly rebuffed his claims.{{r|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 45}} By {{cl|Tales of Suspense Vol 1 51}}, Iron Man being Stark's bodyguard had become Stark's established alibi since the [[Ebenezer Laughton (Earth-616)|Scarecrow]] mentions hearing that Stark kept Iron Man around for that purpose.
* Stark didn't suffer from alcoholism up until a few issues prior to {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 128}}, the issue that featured the story "Demon in a Bottle." Tony's addiction was then retroactively included as part of his past, to the point his father [[Howard Stark (Earth-616)|Howard]] was also eventually depicted as an alcoholic.
* While not as emphasized as it is the case with other prominent super heroes, Iron Man also has a policy against killing enemies.{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 6}}{{r|War Machine Vol 2 1}}{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 520}}
* Tony Stark became the first human to make use of the powerful [[Infinity Gauntlet]] in {{cl|Avengers Vol 4 12}}

| Trivia                  = * Stan Lee based Stark's personality on [[wikipedia:Howard Hughes|Howard Hughes]], explaining, "Howard Hughes was one of the most colorful men of our time. He was an inventor, an adventurer, a multi-millionaire, a ladies man and finally a nutcase."<ref>"Bullpen Bulletins" (Dec. 1997 Marvel Comics): "Stan's Soapbox" (column), by Stan Lee</ref>
* "Stark" means "strong" in several languages, including German and Swedish.
* 2011's {{cl|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 500}} established Tony to be 35 years old. By implementing the ratio of passage of time established by the [[Glossary:Sliding Timescale|Marvel Sliding Timescale]], that would mean he became Iron Man when he was approximately 23 years old. Despite Tony celebrating a birthday in 2013's {{cl|Iron Man Vol 5 6}} and a documented passage of time of eight months before and after 2015's ''[[Secret Wars (2015)|Secret Wars]]'', 2016's {{cl|International Iron Man Vol 1 7}} posits Tony's birth between 35 and 34 years into the past, which would mean he became Iron Man when he was approximately 21 years old.
* In-universe, the exploits of Iron Man (like those of many heroes), are adapted by [[Marvel Comics (Earth-616)|Marvel Comics]] in authorized comics. Since Iron Man's identity was a secret for a long time, when Marvel was eventually given consent to fabricate backstories for heroes with secret identities, the company envisioned Iron Man's alter-ego as a "''[[wikipedia:Top Gun|Top Gun]]'' type" blue-collar worker who took the risks on Tony Stark's equipment and designs, living life fast because he knew it could end the next day. The process was made complicated due to the times Iron Man was allegedly killed in action and replaced.{{r|History of Marvels Comics Vol 1 1}}
* Tony Stark once went to a fan convention posed as an Iron Man cosplayer.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 72}}
* Tony Stark's blood type is A+.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 243}}
* Iron Man is unlockable after beating 2003's ''[[wikipedia:Tony Hawk's Underground|Tony Hawk's Underground]]'' video game.

* According to a 2006 estimate by the American business magazine ''[[wikipedia:Forbes|Forbes]]'', Tony Stark's network is $3.0 billion.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/11/20/tony-stark-money-tech-media_cx_mh_06fict15_iron.html#6d57bd4fb275|title=#8 Tony Stark|work=Forbes|first=Matthew|last=Herper|date=20 November 2006|accessdate=29 June 2020}}}}
* Stark considers himself more attractive than [[Robert Downey, Jr. (Earth-616)|Robert Downey, Jr.]], and has been stated to be more attractive than him by others also.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 2 27}}
* While unconfirmed, it is heavily implied that Tony Stark is bisexual. In 2015's {{cl|Superior Iron Man Vol 1 8}}, Tony wakes up after apparently having had a threesome with another man and a woman. And in 2018's {{cl|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 4}} after becoming an item with [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Janet Van Dyne]], Tony apologizes to both women and men for no longer being on the market. Additionally, his dating profile received male matches, presumably meaning his selected preferences included men.
* According to the Sorcerer Supreme [[Agamotto (Earth-616)|Agamotto]], there must always be a Tony Stark in every existence, and the [[Firehair (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] has stated that Earth-616's Tony Stark is particularly indispensable.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 31}}
* In {{cl|Thor Vol 6 7}}, [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] pranks back Tony Stark by exposing his personal phone number as 212-970-4133. This number is valid, and callers will be answered by a pre-recorded message from Tony Stark explaining that he had to stop using the number because of Thor. He also directs the caller to www.tonystarkironman.com, which redirects to a Marvel.com page about ''Thor'' (Vol. 6) #7.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/comics/news/marvel-iron-man-phone-number-you-can-call-it-now/|title=Marvel Reveals Iron Man's Phone Number & You Can Call It Now|work=ComicBook.com|first=Matthew|last=Aguilar|date=16 September 2020|accessdate=20 September 2020}}}} A video of a call to this number can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R1-YD73VPc here].
