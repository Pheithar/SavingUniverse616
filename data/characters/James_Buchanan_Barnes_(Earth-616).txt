<center>''This is an abridged version of Bucky Barnes' history. For a complete history see '''[[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)/Expanded History|Bucky Barnes' Expanded History]]'''''</center>

===Early life===
James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes was born in 1925.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #2}} In 1935, he tragically lost both of his parents early in his life; his mother, [[Winnifred Barnes (Earth-616)|Winnifred Barnes]] had died when he was a child and his father, [[George Barnes (Earth-616)|George Barnes]] had died in an accident while in basic training at [[Camp Lehigh]].{{r|Captain America and Bucky #620}} Barnes was separated from his younger sister, [[Rebecca Barnes (Earth-616)|Rebecca Barnes]], who was sent to boarding school while he persuaded officials into letting him remain at Camp Lehigh as a ward of the state due to sharing his father's love of the armed forces.{{r|Captain America and Bucky #620}} He was eventually considered the camp mascot. During [[World War II]], Barnes set up a profitable endeavor providing soldiers with various non-requisition supplies in 1940.{{r|Captain America and Bucky #620}} He traveled to England,{{r|Captain America and Bucky #620}} and soon began to receive select assignments as a special military operative, having received hand to hand combat training with British Commandos under the tutelage of William Essart Fairbairn and Colonel Rex Applegate.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 12}}
[[File:George Barnes (Earth-616), Winnifred Barnes (Earth-616), James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616), and Rebecca Barnes (Earth-616) from Captain America and Bucky Vol 1 620 001.jpg|thumb|300px|right|James Barnes with his family]]

After his training with military combat instructors, Barnes met and befriended [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]], who had recently become the US government operative, Captain America.{{r|Captain America and Bucky #620}} He was assigned to accompany Rogers, but was initially unaware of the true nature of his work. One night, Barnes happened into Rogers' tent just as he was changing to his masked identity. Sworn to secrecy, Barnes joined Captain America on his first mission against the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]], freeing many Nazi prisoners. For several months afterward, Barnes underwent an intensive training program under Captain America's tutelage. When he finished, Barnes received his own costumed identity as Bucky and was designated as a counter-example to Hitler Youth. Although he was able to work with his mentor for most of his missions, James was trained to carry out missions the government officials did not want Captain America to be openly involved in. He was cynical and slightly dubious of the idealistic Steve Rogers, but they soon became the closest of friends.{{r|Captain America and Bucky #620|622}}

===As Bucky===
When America entered World War II after the bombing of [[Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, Captain America and Bucky abandoned their military identities for most of the war to devote their full energies to serving as costumed freedom fighters. They soon found themselves allied with the [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]], the original [[Human Torch (Android) (Earth-616)|Human Torch]], and his young mutant partner, [[Thomas Raymond (Earth-616)|Toro]], in a team that [[Winston Churchill (Earth-616)|Winston Churchill]] dubbed the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]].{{r|Giant-Size Invaders #1}} Bucky served Captain America and the Invaders capably and faithfully, leaving the team only temporarily in 1942 to organize and lead his own team of teenage soldiers, the [[Kid Commandos (WWII) (Earth-616)|Kid Commandos]]. Once, to rescue the Invaders from the Red Skull, Bucky assembled a team of costumed super-humans who operated on the home front, a group that would remain together until the end of the war and was known as the [[Liberty Legion (WWII) (Earth-616)|Liberty Legion]].{{r|{{cl|Invaders Vol 1 5}}-[[Invaders Vol 1 6|6]]}}{{r|Marvel Premiere #29|30}} He also worked with another group of teenagers, the [[Young Allies (WWII) (Earth-616)|Young Allies]].{{citation}}
[[File:James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 16 0001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|James Barnes as Bucky, circa [[WWII]]]]

In late 1945, toward the end of the war, Captain America and Bucky were in [[London (England)|London]], [[England]], on the trail of Nazi scientist [[Heinrich Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Heinrich Zemo]]. They discovered Zemo in the process of stealing an experimental drone plane built by the Allies. In the ensuing battle with Zemo's powerful humanoid robot, both Captain America and Bucky were rendered unconscious and strapped to the drone plane to be delivered to [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Hitler]] in [[Berlin]]. Unable to stand the sight of their patriotic costumes, Zemo dressed them in [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Army]] uniforms. Managing to escape before Zemo activated the plane, the two American champions saw the drone plane begin to move just as they jumped off. Quickly, Captain America and Bucky grabbed a motorcycle and tried to catch up with it. Just before it flew out of reach, the two leaped for the plane. Bucky leaped first and managed to get a grip on the plane's wing. Captain America missed, and shouted to his partner to let go in case the plane was booby-trapped. Bucky was unable to comply with his partner's commands because his uniform sleeved snagged onto the cockpit of the plane. The plane exploded, seemingly killing Bucky instantly. Captain America plunged into the [[English Channel]] to undergo the process of [[suspended animation]], but Bucky's remains were never recovered strengthening the belief that he was killed in action.{{r|Avengers #4}}

===As the Winter Soldier===
Bucky however was very much alive. When he had failed to disarm the plane in time he had leaped off of the plane but did not escape completely unscratched. The explosion had claimed his entire left arm. He then plunged into the icy waters only to undergo the same process his mentor had. After the war had ended, a Russian submarine hoping to recover and capture the missing "Captain America" instead found the preserved body of Bucky. After being retrieved and examined for any traces of the [[Super-Soldier Serum]], his body was placed in [[cryostasis]].{{r|Captain America Vol 5 11}}
[[File:James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616) from Captain America Vol 5 2 0001.png|right|180px|thumb|Recovery]]

Winter Soldier was used to conduct many strategic assassinations across the world and would sometimes stay in one nation for extended periods. One of his targets was [[Itsu (Earth-616)|Itsu]], the pregnant wife of his wartime ally [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]] who he killed in 1946 under orders from an [[Romulus (Earth-616)|unknown]] source.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 #40}}

In 1954, he was revived and outfitted with a replacement bionic arm, which had been made after a Soviet spy had recovered schematics for cybernetic appendage. The arm was to be replaced by a newer and more advanced one every time there was an improvement in their technology. While he had no memory of his past, Barnes still had considerable physical skill. He was indoctrinated to hate the West and was provided with mental implants during sensory deprivation, molding him into the perfect assassin.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 11}}

====Red Room====
It was during this period that he met [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Natasha Romanoff]], who was part of the [[Black Widow Ops Program (Earth-616)|Black Widow Ops Program]].{{r|Captain America and Bucky Vol 1 624}}
[[File:Black Widow Ops Program (Earth-616) from Winter Soldier Vol 1 7 001.jpg|left|180px|thumb|Winter Soldier training Natasha Romanoff in the Red Room]]
He helped train her in combat while she was undergoing espionage training at the [[Red Room Academy (Moscow)|Red Room Academy]], where he also handled the unsuccessful [[Niko Constantin (Earth-616)|Wolf Spider Ops Program]]. They fell in love and James often snuck into her sleeping quarters to be with her. Although Natasha was promised to [[Alexi Shostakov (Earth-616)|Alexi Shostakov]], she loved James more. This relationship did not last, however. After an incident during an assassination operation, Barnes was deemed unstable and put in cryostasis whenever he wasn't needed for a mission.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 27}}{{r|Captain America Vol 1 617}}{{r|Captain America and Bucky Vol 1 624}}

====Assassin====
In November 1963, he became the second gunman who shot [[John F. Kennedy (Earth-616)|JFK]].{{r|Captain America Vol 5 50}} In 1966, he was designated to catch two Nazi scientists, Peter and Mila Hitzig, creators of the Alchemy Formula, but he remembered his own identity during a fight against [[Lord Drain (Earth-616)|Drain]], a [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] agent also engaged in their recovery. With the help of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Ran Shen (Earth-616)|Ran Shen]], he tried to help Mila escape before [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] accidentally killed her. Recovered by the Russians, the Winter Soldier received additional brainwashing in order to avoid similar incidents.{{r|Winter Soldier: The Bitter March #5}} However, after one missions in 1973, Barnes did not report back on time. He was tracked to a flophouse in [[New York City]], where coincidentally his former teammate Namor was also sleeping. As both men had amnesia, neither man recognized the other.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 11}}

In 1983, he was assigned to accompany [[Vasily Karpov (Earth-616)|Vasily Karpov]], an elderly general that had served in WWII, as a bodyguard. He maintained the position until the general's death five years later, in 1988. Barnes had demonstrated mental instability in some of his later missions and was placed into stasis at one of Karpov's storage facilities which had been inherited by his protégé, General [[Aleksander Lukin (Earth-616)|Aleksander Lukin]]. Following the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]]'s collapse, Lukin went rogue and established the [[Kronas Corporation (Earth-616)|Kronas Oil Corporation]].{{r|Captain America Vol 5 1}}

===Reunion===
[[File:Captain America Vol 5 14 Textless.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Winter Soldier vs. Captain America]]
In order to seize the Red Skull's new [[Cosmic Cube]], General Lukin reactivated Barnes to assassinate Red Skull, although neither of them realized the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] had simultaneously transferred his consciousness into Lukin's body.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 1}} After assassinating the adventurer, [[Jack Monroe (Earth-616)|Nomad]] and framing him for Red Skull's assassination,{{r|Captain America Vol 5 3}} Barnes detonated a firebomb in [[Philadelphia (Pennsylvania)|Philadelphia]] which claimed many victims.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 6}} Their deaths helped power the Cosmic Cube, but Lukin who had been disturbed by the Cube's effect gave it to Barnes to store in a nuclear-safe vault in [[West Virginia (State)|West Virginia]].{{r|Captain America Vol 5 13}} During the investigations by Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D., Captain America discovered the true identity of the Lukin's assassin, Winter Soldier and confronted him at the vault.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 14}} The two engaged in combat until Rogers gained possession of the Cube and used its powers to restore Barnes' lost memories.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 14}} Overcome with remorse, Bucky destroyed the Cosmic Cube to teleport away and went underground to search for Lukin and the Red Skull. But was still unaware that they were now one and the same.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 14}}

After a confrontation with the now [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Man]] Wolverine in [[Serbia]], Bucky managed to track Lukin to England where the Skull unleashed a sleeper robot, salvaged from the Eisendorf excavation. Barnes abandoned his initial intentions to seek and eliminate Lukin to aid Rogers in destroying the robot. This was the first time in over half a century that they worked together, but he fled afterwards unable to face his mentor. He was revealed to be an undercover operative working for Nick Fury, who had gone underground after leaving S.H.I.E.L.D. Barnes encountered the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] [[Elijah Bradley (Earth-616)|Patriot]], [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], and [[Vision (Jonas) (Earth-616)|Vision]] on one of his assignments and learned how his and Cap's adventures had inspired contemporary heroes. He also reconciled with his former Invaders teammate Namor,{{r|Winter Soldier: Winter Kills #1}} assisted Wolverine with incapacitating his son [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]], and comforted a [[Elijah Bradley (Earth-616)|cynical Patriot]].{{r|Young Avengers Presents #1}}

===Death of Captain America===
Following Captain America's assassination, Barnes resolved to kill the two men he held responsible: the Red Skull and current S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]. He acquired [[Captain America's Shield|Cap's indestructible shield]] after defeating Black Widow, his former lover and student, in combat when she was assigned to move it to another location. Barnes then tracked Lukin and eventually confronted him only to discover his quarry was not a lead, but the Red Skull himself. Eventually captured by the Skull's forces, he resisted brainwashing by [[Johann Fennhoff (Earth-616)|Dr. Faustus]] and was rescued by [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] with the help of [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]], who was pretending to still be under Faustus' control. Barnes was then placed into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, but escaped and confronted Stark. He disabled his armor and fought him to a standstill only to learn his mentor's final requests of Stark: to rescue Barnes from his descent into violence and insanity and to pass the Captain America identity to a successor. Stark felt the best way to honor both his friend's requests was for Barnes to become Captain America. Barnes agreed on the provision that his mind be cleansed of any remaining mental implants, and that he would answer to no one, not even Stark and S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 33}}

===Becoming Captain America===
Now residing in Steve Rogers S.H.I.E.L.D. safe house, he outfitted himself with an alternate version of Cap's costume built by Tony Stark and, carrying his indestructible shield along with other weapons, Barnes quickly reacted against the efforts by the Red Skull and his accomplices to spread panic. Although effective in battle, he had yet to win the support or respect of either the US government or the general public. A number of civilians and costumed adventurers also disapproved of his current wardrobe; especially [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Clint Barton]]. Despite the negative attention Barnes received, he continued to fight terrorism as Captain America and was often aided by [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]], despite his initial disapproval of him. Together the two fought an [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] cell headed by [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]]. The Red Skull did not remain quiet for long. He responded to Barnes' meddling by sending the [[William Burnside (Earth-616)|Grand Director]], whose mind had been molded by Doctor Faustus to believe he was Steve Rogers, after him; James barely survived the confrontation, and was forced by Falcon to retreat. The two investigated the Grand Director's next course of actions after he escaped from the Skull's grasp and was becoming mentally unstable; most of it was hiding and running from detection by A.I.M. and the Red Skull.{{r|{{cl|Captain America Vol 5 34}}-[[Captain America Vol 5 42|42]]}}
[[File:Natalia Romanova (Earth-616) and James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616) from Captain America Vol 5 42 001.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Back with Natasha]]

James was finally recognized by the United States government and the public as a hero after foiling an assassination attempt on both Republican and Democratic candidates for political debates by [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Sin]], daughter of the Red Skull. At this time, he also revisited his relationship with the Black Widow, one of his few remaining friends who was consistently faithful to him.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 41|42}} It was not long before he became involved in major conflicts such as an [[Secret Invasion|Invasion]] by extraterrestrial [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] alongside many other superheroes in New York.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 6|8}}
[[File:Secret Invasion Vol 1 6 Textless.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Fighting the Skrull Invasion]]

Wanting to continue to living his predecessor's legacy, James invited Clint Barton and the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] to his safe-house, offering it as their base of operations as well as his own allegiance to their cause.{{r|New Avengers #48}} And, at the end of a battle that involved the Avengers, the New Avengers and the Invaders, Toro, the former Invader, was revived by James: the Cosmic Cube satisfied his wish to have his friend alive once again.{{r|Avengers / Invaders #1}}

Although he was reformed, there were still a few officials from both America and other foreign nations who had not all forgotten his past as the Winter Soldier. Soon, he had to face one of the crimes committed as the Winter Soldier, when he had tried to kill chinese scientist [[Zhang Chin (Earth-616)|Zhang Chin]] in 1968, after the Invaders had already saved him from Japanese in 1942. This one wanted to use the Original Human Torch DNA as a virus to spread worldwide, but Bucky and Namor defeated the [[Philip Wing (Earth-616)|The Man with No Face]] and prevented his project. The Human Torch was buried honorably.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 48}}

===Captain America: Reborn===
Bucky found out from Sharon that she had not really killed the original Captain America. As explained by Doctor Zola to [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Osborn]], Rogers was trapped in a fixed position of time and space. But since Sharon ruined the machine that was suppose to bring him back, Steve was reliving his own past. Bucky and Black Widow attempted to steal the device from [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]], but they were captured. Osborn sent Widow back to Sharon with an ultimatum: either she would turn herself in, as Osborn had implicated her as Rogers' second shooter, or he would kill Bucky. Bucky was then sent into the custody of the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], who told him that he would be inducted into their group once Rogers was brought back. However, Bucky was secretly freed by [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] and then rescued by Falcon.{{r|Captain America: Reborn #1|3}}

[[File:who will weld shield1 pg23.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Barnes succeeding a retiring Rogers]]
After a period of reflection, Barnes decided to give up the Captain America identity in favor of the revived Rogers. Before giving up the Captain America mantle, however, Bucky and the Black Widow chose to fight and throw the shield one last time. Coincidentally, Rogers was suited up and ready to fight crime that night as well until he witnessed Bucky and the Black Widow depart. Rogers decided to pursue the dynamic duo and, upon doing so, realized that Bucky would be well off as Captain America. A quick battle ensued when Bucky and the Black Widow encountered [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mr. Hyde]] and his henchman. After the two heroes dispensed with the henchman, Mr. Hyde attempted to escape, until Rogers joined the battle and defeated him. Quickly after, Rogers officially and respectfully handed the Captain America mantle over to Bucky and gave him his blessing.{{r|Captain America: Who Will Wield the Shield? Vol 1 1}}

===Captain a while longer===
When [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Osborn]] attacked Asgard, the heroes fought against his attempt of establishing an absolute power. For the first time, two Captains America took part to the battle: James and Steve contributed to defeat Osborn's forces.{{r|Siege #2|4}} At the end of the war, the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] was abolished and Steve Rogers designated James Barnes as member of the new [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], whose first mission brought them to the future, fighting [[Ultron (Earth-10943)|Ultron]].{{r|Avengers Vol 4 #1|6}}

James again confronted the Grand Director, who had become the leader of the [[Watchdogs (Earth-616)|Watchdogs]], as he couldn't stand how America had changed to the worse. Infiltrated in their troops, Barnes was recognized and kidnapped to pose as Bucky in the video that would have shown the explosion of the Hoover Dam. But Falcon firstly prevented the massacre of a train charged with explosives, then helped Bucky defeat the Grand Director, whose body wasn't found in the river where he had fallen.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 605}}

[[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Helmut Zemo]] accused Bucky of not being worthy to bear Cap's Shield and achieved the aim to discredit him as the new Captain America in the public eye by revealing his past as the Winter Soldier, thanks to the secret revelations of Sinthea Shmidt. Bucky was evasive to save his friends from the new Red Skull girl and was condemned, even though the punishment resulted already extinguished.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 615}} A [[Arkady Jadnoski (Earth-616)|Russian ambassador]] demanded James' extradition to Russia, where he had been found guilty for a double homicide of their citizens. In the Gulag, Bucky was forced to fight the villains imprisoned there, most who wanted him dead, and received the help of some of them, like [[Niko Constantin (Earth-616)|Niko Constantin]], part of the Wolf Spider project. When [[Andre Rostov (Earth-616)|Colonel Rostov]] recovered the Zephyr codes, the plan was revealed to be a trap and Bucky decided to escape during his third public battle. He succeeded and was rescued by the Black Widow, aware of Russians' strategy: in fact, the two citizens killed in 1982 had been Rostov's KGB agents.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 619}}

===[[Fear Itself]]===
[[File:Fear Itself Vol 1 7.1 Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Bucky seriously wounded from the attack from Skadi]]
When [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Skadi]] led her attack on [[Washington, D.C.]] Bucky was there to oppose her; however, her power proved too great and he was beat to with-in an inch of his life. Before passing out, Bucky told Black Widow to warn people about the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]].{{r|Fear Itself #3}} Barnes was rushed to Fury, who gave him the [[Infinity Formula]], which saved his life and restored him. Bucky decided to stay underground and returned to his Winter Soldier identity.{{r|Fear Itself #7.1}} Bucky's [[Life-Model Decoy|LMD]] was buried at the [[Arlington National Cemetery]].{{r|Fear Itself #7}}

===Winter Soldier again===
Believed dead and seeking personal redemption, James went underground and, along with Black Widow, decided to provide protection to Cold War sleeper Zephyr agents. He killed two of the three super soldiers that [[Lucia von Bardas (Earth-616)|Madame Von Bardas]] had used to attempt to destroy [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]. The third, [[Leonid Novokov (Earth-616)|Leo Novokov]], had woken up from hibernation twelve years before. Considering the Winter Soldier a betrayer of his homeland, he firstly sent him a message by killing the [[Fred Davis Jr. (Earth-616)|second Bucky]], then kidnapped the Black Widow as he wanted to hit James in his personal affairs. Bucky, intending to save his lover, accepted the mission that Leo prepared and attacked Daredevil; then, at the Arlington Cemetery, he defeated the soldier. However, Leo achieved his revenge: Natasha's memories were all recovered, except for what concerned Bucky.{{r|Winter Soldier Vol 1 1|14}}

Later, James confronted [[Tesla Tarasova (Earth-616)|Tesla Tarasova]], the daughter of Linus Tarasova, victim of the Winter Soldier in 1983. Tesla had killed Father Hammer, the leader of an island where orphans grew as weapons to sale, like she had been, and seemed to want to change her past thanks to the cosmic rays that her father invented. Reached at the space base, the girl faced James, who explained how he grew better by accepting his difficult past. The base was attacked by the S.H.I.E.L.D., James and Tesla survived and the girl eventually escaped.{{r|Winter Soldier Vol 1 19}}

Eventually, the Winter Soldier reappeared as a member of the reassembled All-New Invaders, fighting the Kree [[R'Klll (Earth-616)|Tanalth]] and freeing Toro, now an Inhuman, from [[Kurt Dagmar (Earth-616)|Kurt Dagmar]], which gave him the possibility to investigate about Martians attacks during the history and their link with [[Jonathan Raven (Earth-691)|Killraven]].{{r|All-New Invaders Vol 1 1|12}}

In the meantime, Bucky was keeping tabs on Natasha and acting as her personal guardian angel on multiple occasions.{{r|Black Widow Vol 5 8}}{{r|Black Widow Vol 5 15}}{{r|Black Widow Vol 5 18}}

===Original Sin===
Bucky was one of the heroes secretly gathered by Nick Fury to supposedly investigate the death of [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu]] the Watcher,{{r|Original Sin #1}} when those heroes were actually meant to find a trail of Fury's activities as "the Man on the Wall" (the secret first line of defense against space invaders) in order to become his replacement.{{r|Original Sin #5}}

When Bucky realized he had been lied to, he attacked the LMD of Nick Fury left in the Avengers Tower, and used it to find the location of the real Nick.{{r|Original Sin #4}} The other selected heroes made their own way to said location, a secret satellite. There, the aged Nick Fury confronted the heroes and told them what he wanted with them.{{r|Original Sin #5}} When Fury got an alert that the body of the LMD left with the Avengers had self-destructed because someone was trying to investigate it, he took one of the Watcher's eyes from Bucky and enclosed himself in a secure room, as he tried to activate the second eye he had all this time. When the Avengers arrived to the satellite, as Iron Man tracked down the signal from the LMD, Fury confronted the heroes, equipped with an armor while holding the two eyes of the Watcher, claiming that his eyes had been opened.{{r|Original Sin #6}}

[[File:Original Sin Vol 1 8 Dell'Otto Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|right]]
Fury managed to repel the heroes and get back to the [[Watcher's Citadel]],{{r|Original Sin #7}} where [[Cosmic Man (Midas) (Earth-616)|Doctor Midas]] was trying to acquire more power than he had when he attacked the citadel. Fury fought Midas' [[Mindless Ones]], during which fight one of the Watcher's eyes was taken from him by the [[Orb (Mercenary) (Earth-616)|Orb]], and was almost defeated, until the Winter Soldier and the other heroes chosen by Fury got to him, and also managed to get the confession from him that he was the one who had killed Uatu. After Fury's apparent death in the explosion which killed Doctor Midas, the Winter Soldier took his place as the Man on the Wall.{{r|Original Sin #8}}

===As The Man on the Wall===
Bucky recruited [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Daisy Johnson]] for the space mission as "the Man on the Wall". After killing the king of Syro and stealing the sacred beast Reznor, James started to investigate about the illum, an empathogen drug that led him to [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-14412)|Loki]]. Bucky reached Loki in [[Asgardia]], even though [[Bucky|Old Bucky]] had hurt him shooting an illum bullet. Loki eventually revealed that illum came from the planet Mer-Z-Bow, governed by Princess [[Ventolin Xtal (Earth-616)|Ventolin]], a new space threat according to Fury. Meanwhile, the Old Bucky secretly explained to Daisy his attempt to save James's future, as he had already done with his pasts in the other realities. James and Daisy come to Mer-Z-Bow, where they were received pacifically by the [[Pao'Ree]]. James fell in love with Ventolin, when, suddenly, a man who wore [[Crossbones]]'s mask introduced in the royal palace and stabbed Daisy, then tried to kill the couple destroying the place with a bomb. The villain was a Nick Fury Jr. coming from Old Bucky's reality and intended to explain what hate meant to the Winter Soldier, an ally of his father, whose absence in the childhood left a mark on his life. As he could destroy Mer-Z-Bow, Loki intervened, ordering Ventolin to consign the planet, as he wanted to control illum trade. In exchange for that, he stopped stop Crossbones but, sending Daisy to his Gun-Moon Planetoid "Venter" by a trick, he gave to the the villain the possibility to face the two Winter Soldiers. Daisy had already hurt Crossbones, who was escaping through a White Hole. The Old Bucky chased him and crashed in his space shuttle, grounding to his original universe, where he found Crossbones died and could meet again his Ventolin on the reborn planet Syro. On Earth-616, a dumb Loki was put in prison by Ventolin, and the girl could finally share her love with Bucky in the Polarity Paradox Engine, the two aware of the strength of their feeling.{{r|Bucky Barnes: The Winter Soldier Vol 1 1}}

===Pleasant Hill===
The Winter Soldier became involved in the search of a clandestine S.H.I.E.L.D. operation involving the manipulation of Cosmic Cube fragments that was called the Kobik Initiative. Since he had attacked several S.H.I.E.L.D. outposts on his search for clues, Bucky was trailed by Steve. Bucky met up with Rogers and informed him about the project's existence, and escaped before S.H.I.E.L.D. agents could capture him.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Alpha #1}} Bucky later infiltrated [[Pleasant Hill]], a super-villain prison where at its core was the sentient Cosmic Cube [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]]. Shortly before Bucky's arrival, a massive break-out had been orchestrated by [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]]. Bucky stumbled upon Sam Wilson, who had taken the mantle of Captain America from Steve after he had been stripped of the Super-Soldier Serum, and went looking for Rogers. By the time the two of them found him, Kobik had restored Steve to his prime.{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson #7}}

The trio made their way through Pleasant Hill and joined forces with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]] to put an end to Baron Zemo's reign of terror.{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson #8}} During the final assault, Kobik became disillusioned by how Baron Zemo had tried to use her. Bucky prepared to shoot her, deeming her too much of a threat, but she tossed him out a window and out of town. As the crisis came to an end, Kobik appeared to Bucky, distraught and begging to prove she can do good. Bucky agreed to take her in, to which Kobik replied that she also wanted to bring in some "friends" of hers.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Omega #1}} This led to Bucky creating another incarnation of the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], having as main objective to be the guardian of Kobik and Earth's last line of defense against alien threats, continuing his job as "the Man on the Wall."{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 1}}

===The love story continues===
Even with the Thunderbolts, Bucky would occasionally go on missions by himself and, despite trying to forget about Natasha, she'd often be on his mind, and he was still protecting her from the shadows.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 5}}{{r|Black Widow Vol 6 10}} One time, Bucky was captured by [[Headmistress (Anya) (Earth-616)|Recluse]], who sought revenge on Natasha for killing their teacher and abandoning her. When Natasha got to the scene, she managed to free Barnes and the two fought together to defeat her. In the end, he revealed Fury wanted to speak with her.{{r|Black Widow Vol 6 9}}
[[File:Natalia Romanova (Earth-616) and James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616) from Black Widow Vol 6 10 001.jpg|thumb||left|200px]]

Natasha agreed to pay Fury a visit on the Moon and the two were accompanied by [[Ilija Knezevic (Earth-616)|Lion]], who, unbeknownst to them, had brought a stowaway with him and was planning to leave Bucky and Natasha stranded on the Moon. When they finally got there, Lion tried to take all the knowledge from Fury, but was overloaded by the information and died. In the meantime, the stowaway was preparing to lift off and Natasha and Bucky were both running out of oxygen, so Natasha transferred her entire supply to Bucky so that he could stop their ship from leaving and so that she could repay him for all the times he'd protected her in the previous year.{{r|Black Widow Vol 6 10}}

Once Bucky took control of the situation, he went back for Nat as fast as possible and tried to revive her. After almost giving up, Nat let out a grunt and the two kissed. As they let go, Bucky asked if she remembered everything, but Nat cleverly avoided the question.{{r|Black Widow Vol 6 10}}

===Thunderbolts===
After several adventures with the Thunderbolts,{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 2|9}} Bucky was ambushed by the reformed [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] led by Baron Zemo. A battered Bucky was brought before Kobik so she would be forced to do Zemo's bidding, but, instead, Kobik transported herself and Bucky away after he agreed to let her "fix everything".{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 10}} Her attempt to "fix everything", however, involved turning him into a follower of Hydra. Kobik made him relive World War II with a few changes to allow his conversion, but Bucky held on to his ideals, forcing Kobik to intervene to tell him that wasn't supposed to happen. This was when Bucky learned of Kobik's fascination with Hydra and how she had secretly turned Steve Rogers into a Hydra agent. Bucky argued with Kobik over what she had done, causing Kobik to become very upset and throw a tantrum.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 11}}
[[File:Thunderbolts Vol 3 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|200px]]

Kobik's tantrum made her rage out of control threatening not only the Masters of Evil and the Thunderbolts but all of existence. Fixer managed to prevent this by zapping Kobik with laser beams, but he also unintentionally shattered her into Cosmic Cube fragments, which were then scattered throughout the world. Bucky tried fighting off Zemo, but he was betrayed by his fellow Thunderbolt Moonstone. After Bucky was captured, Zemo and his Masters of Evil left.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 12}}

Zemo decided to get rid of Bucky by strapping him to a replica of the drone plane that killed his father and launching it before having it explode. Before launching the drone, Zemo showed Bucky a holographic message left for him by Steve Rogers. In the message, Rogers apologized for what was about to happen to him but was left with no choice, fearing that Bucky would interfere with his plan to conquer the [[United States of America]]. The message left Bucky emotionally devastated, and he proclaimed that wasn't Steve. Zemo then launched the drone, which later exploded over the ocean, seemingly killing Bucky.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 16}}

In truth, he'd actually survived the blast and Namor had saved him from drowning, keeping him as his advisor.{{r|Captain America Vol 8 25}} Namor later presented Bucky to the contingent of American superheroes that had assembled to fight Hydra and return the country to normal.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 8}} When Sam Wilson gave [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|the alternate Steve Rogers]] the last fragment of the Cosmic Cube that he was reassembling, Ant-Man shrunk Bucky to a subatomic level inside the Cosmic Cube, reaching Kobik's mindscape to bring her and the real Steve Rogers back to existence. The fascist Steve Rogers was subsequently defeated by the real one.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}}

Barnes has mastered and implemented several methods to silently eliminate sentries with bladed weapons, garrotes or his bare hands, making him as lethal in his own way as his former Invader teammates, the Torches, Union Jack or Namor. He is a master at stealth and tracking and is very intelligent. He was able to render [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s superhumanly acute senses such as smell completely useless by luring him to an abandoned warehouse that was completely soaked on the inside with oil and even soaking himself to make it so that Wolverine could not detect him.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 #39}} Barnes has made a habit out of constantly studying his surroundings and depicting what he can and cannot do in whatever situation he should fall in much like his former partner, Captain America before his death. During Barnes' visit to the Captain America exhibit that had been made to honor him after his death, he was constantly detecting potential ways to sneak in and out of the museum and the room without being detected and only taking out a small number of security to do so.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 #27}} The [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] stated to Tony Stark that he was one of the most dangerous men she knew.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 #27}}

| Strength                = '''Superhuman Strength:''' With the bionic arm, Barnes possessed some level of superhuman strength. Aside from his bionic arm, his strength is at the peak of human potential, which makes him stronger than normal humans. He can physically exert his strength for an over-head lift of up to 800 lbs. (363 kg) if necessary.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #12}}{{r|Captain America Vol 5 #11}}{{r|Captain America Vol 5 #18}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #2}}

| Weaknesses              = Electromagnetic pulses could theoretically render his bionic arm useless;{{r|Captain America Vol 5 #33}} however, his arm is capable of emitting an EMP itself and thus must have some degree of shielding.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 #32}}

| Equipment               = '''Mask and Body Armor:''' In addition to body armor,{{r|Captain America Vol 5 #1}} Barnes wears a domino mask with technology that can detect hidden areas and locations.{{r|Winter Soldier Vol 1 15}}

| Notes                   = 
* Bucky Barnes was one of the characters featured in Series A of the Marvel Value Stamps issued in the 1970's. [[File:Bucky Barnes Marvel Value Stamp.jpg|thumb|right|Marvel Value Stamp #51]]
* Bucky was ranked as 53rd on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes in 2011.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/lists/comic-book-heroes/53|title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes|work=IGN.com|first=|last=|date=|accessdate=26 February 2019}}}}
* Bucky was also ranked as 8th in "The Top 50 Avengers."<ref>[http://www.ign.com/lists/avengers/8 Bucky as the 8th top Avenger at IGN's official site]</ref>

| Trivia                  = 
* Bucky used to be notable as one of the few comic book deaths that stuck. A frequent aphorism among comic book fans, known as the Bucky Clause, was that "No one in comics stays dead except Bucky, [[w:c:DC:Jason Todd (New Earth)|Jason Todd]], and [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|Uncle Ben]]". Ironically, both Bucky and Todd have been brought back to life in their respective universes.
** Bucky's death has also been used to explain why the Marvel Universe has very few kid sidekicks, as no responsible hero wanted to endanger a minor in similar fashion. Stan Lee also harbored a well-known dislike for young sidekicks in general. 
** [[Roger Stern]] and [[John Byrne]] also considered bringing Bucky back, before deciding against it.<ref>[http://byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=2&T1=Questions+about+Comic+Book+Projects#16 Byrne Robotics FAQ]; "Did JB ever consider bringing Bucky back?"</ref>
* During {{cl|Incredible Hulk Vol 1}}, there was a group of immortals called the [[Pantheon (Earth-616)|Pantheon]]. Their leader, [[Vali Halfling (Earth-616)|Agamemnon]], was rumored by the readers to be Bucky, due to his appearance and his stories about his adventures during the World War II.
* In {{cl|Dark Reign: The List - Avengers #1}}, Bucky stated he assassinated Hitler, although it is known that it was the original [[Human Torch (Android) (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] from {{cl|What If? #4}} (in continuity) and {{cl|Secret Avengers #23}}. [[Tom Brevoort|Tom Brevoort]] confirmed many times it was in fact a joke from Bucky.<ref>[[Tom Brevoort|Tom Brevoort]]'s [http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/post/87983659448/in-dark-reign-the-list-avengers-bucky-said-that-he statement]</ref>
* It was revealed in {{cl|Wolverine Vol 3 38}} that Bucky had a hand in helping Wolverine escape from the [[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X]] program.
* The name Winter Soldier derives from the writing of [[wikipedia:Thomas Paine|Thomas Paine]], the American revolutionary: "These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman" (The American Crisis, a pamphlet published in 1776).{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.themarysue.com/winter-soldier-history/|title=Learn the History of the Term "Winter Soldier" and Why Ed Brubaker Used the Name in Captain America|work=themarysue.com|first=|last=|date=|accessdate=21 March 2014}}}}
