| Quotation               = I was blind. Blind to how the world worked…and then I met [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|a man]] who taught me to see——''see how things really were''. I ''loved'' him for it. And because I loved him——''because I believed in him…and, in a way worshipped him''——I claimed the things that he had faith in as my own. He called it his '''''dream'''''. It was a '''''good one'''''. But the world, you see——''the waking world''——where we all live…it is a ''killer of dreams''. A '''''destroyer''''' of things you '''''believe in'''''. So when I grew older, I realized it was foolish to…'''''deify him'''''. ''Honestly,'' it’s unfair to expect that kind of perfection from anyone. After all, we’re all '''''flawed''''' and '''''imperfect'''''. There is no real difference between any of us. ''No matter how much we believe the lie that there is.'' You see, he wasn’t a savior. He was just a man——a [[Homo superior|mutant]]——like me. And his dreams——''which still make me smile to this day''——are no more valid than anyone else’s. Including mine. I love the ''idea'' of that. The ''promise'' of it. ''So what’s my story?'' I’m a '''''dreamer'''''. I’m an '''''[[X-Men|X-Man]].'''''

===Early Years===
[[File:Summers Family (Earth-616) 0001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Scott, Alex and his parents, Katherine and Christopher]]
Scott Summers is the oldest son of Major [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|Christopher Summers]] (AKA Corsair), a test pilot in the [[United States Air Force (Earth-616)|U.S. Air Force]] and his wife [[Katherine Summers (Earth-616)|Katherine Ann]]. His younger brother is [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Alex]], known today as the mutant Havok.{{r|X-Men #54}}

When Scott and Alex were boys flying home from a family vacation in their father's vintage private plane, a scout ship from the alien [[Shi'ar Empire]] suddenly materialized and set the plane ablaze. Katherine pushed Scott and Alex out the plane door with the only available parachute. The parachute caught fire, so Scott used his mutant optic blasts for the first time to slow their descent. Scott and Alex were unaware that their parents had been teleported from the plane by the [[Shi'ar]] a moment before it exploded.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 #115}}

[[File:Summers Family (Earth-616) 0002.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Scott and Alex in parachute]]
Scott suffered a head injury on landing that damaged the part of Scott's brain that would have enabled him to control his optic blasts. The two boys were hospitalized and both suffered traumatic amnesia regarding the incident.{{r|X-Factor #39}} The geneticist, who happened to be [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Sinister]], took an interest in the boys. He believed that Scott was the Summers brother with the most potential, so he had Alex adopted to separate them and render Scott emotionally vulnerable, something he became.{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 42|43}}

One night, Scott woke up and destroyed the roof of the hospital with his optic blast. When Scott woke up again, a year had passed. Upon recovering, Scott was placed in the [[Mister Sinister's Orphanage|State Home for Foundlings]], an orphanage in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska (State)|Nebraska]]. There he was subjected to batteries of tests and experiments by the orphanage's owner, Mr. Milbury, an alias for Mr. Sinister. Sinister placed mental blocks on Scott and took on the role of "Lefty," who was Scott's roommate and bullied him at the orphanage. Sinister intervened any time anyone came close to adopting Scott.{{Citation}}

As a teenager, Scott began to suffer from severe headaches and he was sent to a specialist (again Sinister in disguise), who provided him with lenses made of [[Ruby-Quartz|ruby-quartz]]. Soon after, Scott's mutant power erupted from his eyes as an uncontrollable blast of optic force. The blast demolished a crane, causing it to drop its payload toward a terrified crowd. Scott saved everyone by obliterating the object with another blast, but the bystanders believed that he had tried to kill them and rallied into an angry mob. Scott fled, escaping on a freight train.{{r|X-Men #38}}

Scott was drawn to a mutant criminal named Jack Winters, also known as the [[Jack Winters (Earth-616)|Jack O'Diamonds]]. Jack O'Diamonds sought to use Scott's new found talent in his crimes and physically abused the young boy when he initially refused. However, Scott's display of power had attracted the attention of the mutant [[Telepathy|telepath]] [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]], who teamed up with [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|FBI]] agent [[Frederick Duncan (Earth-616)|Fred Duncan]] to find Scott. Scott was rescued from Winters' clutches and was enlisted by Professor Xavier as the first member of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], a team of young mutants who trained to use their powers in Professor Xavier's dream for human/mutant equality.{{r|X-Men #42}}

===X-Men===
In the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|School for Gifted Youngsters]] the X-Men were tutored by Professor X and trained in the use of their powers in the [[Danger Room]]. Xavier provided Scott with a visor made of ruby quartz to help him control his powers in the field. As Cyclops, Scott became deputy leader of the X-Men. While he was a skilled tactician, Scott's social skills were lacking. Scott had fallen in love with his teammate [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], but his reserved demeanor prevented him from expressing his actual feelings for her.{{r|X-Men #3}}

===Time-Displaced===
Beast from the future traveled to their time in order to inform them that the future was in a bad state, and that only the original X-Men could help fix it.{{r|All-New X-Men #1}} Scott and the rest of the X-Men accompanied him to a future where Scott had killed Xavier, and Jean was dead (with the school now named after her). The shock of this caused Jean's dormant telepathic powers to surface.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 2}} While confronting the future Cyclops, Jean read his mind and was incredibly disturbed at what she had seen. This caused her to reject Scott. Under Jean's leadership, the team decided to stay in this time until its problems were resolved.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 4}}

Cyclops found himself shunned by the X-Men and other students at the school, and constantly under the watchful eye of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] who was considering killing Scott to stop the older Scott from ever killing Xavier. He decided to leave the school and stole Wolverine's motorcycle. Wolverine chased him down to bring him back to the school, but Cyclops evaded him by blasting him away, continuing his escape.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 5}} He traveled to a bank where he had kept a deposit box, hoping his future self had kept it. Guards at the bank were alerted to his presence, believing him to be his future self, and attempted to arrest him.

[[File:All-New X-Men Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Cyclops and the X-Men]]
[[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] disguised as Wolverine arrived and freed Cyclops, telling him she was an old friend of Professor Xavier, and told him that he alone could stop and kill his future self. She also told him that Wolverine had corrupted the school and was using it to turn the children into killing machines and that he was the only one that could set it back on track. When the real Wolverine arrived, Mystique escaped, but not before urging Cyclops to start keeping a list of mutants and their powers. Cyclops returned to the school with the real Wolverine.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 7}}

When Cyclops' future self came to the School in order to find recruits for his X-Men, the young Angel left with him, to young Cyclops' dismay.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 11}} Cyclops and the other past X-Men were placed under the tutelage of [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]], with whom they were to continue their training. Cyclops continued to uncover more and more about his future, including his marriage to Jean. He eventually uncovered the truth about Mystique, and foiled her scheme to buy [[Madripoor]] with the other X-Men.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 14}}

====[[Battle of the Atom]]====
During a mission to subdue a [[Blake Schiel (Earth-616)|new mutant]], Cyclops, the original X-Men and Kitty Pryde came under attack by [[Sentinels]]. They were assisted by the arrival of adult Cyclops and his team, and together they defeated the Sentinels. During the battle however, past Cyclops took a hit, and was briefly clinically dead, causing his future self to blink out of existence. After being healed by [[Christopher Muse (Earth-616)|Triage]], Cyclops recovered and his future self returned. Shortly after that, a team of [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-13729)|"X-Men"]] arrived from the future,{{r|X-Men: Battle of the Atom Vol 1 1}} to tell the X-Men of the present that the past X-Men needed to return to their own time. Jean sensed that these "X-Men" were hiding something, and tried to urge her companions to flee. Cyclops was the only one that trusted her enough to leave, and the two escaped.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 16}} After escaping, the two were able to find refuge with adult Cyclops.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 5}} The future "X-Men" were revealed to be a future [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], after [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]], past Beast, and past Iceman traveled to their future and brought the real [[X-Men (Earth-13729)|future X-Men]] back.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 12}}

[[File:Cyclops Vol 3 1 Land Variant Textless.jpg|180px|thumb|right]]
In a last attempt to accomplish their goal of rewriting history, the Brotherhood instead transported all of the X-Men to Camp Hammond, the site of the X-Men's very first mission. Here, they were attacked by SHIELD who were revealed to have their own Sentinels. The X-Men beat back the assault, and the future Brotherhood was defeated. Angry that Wolverine's X-Men didn't trust her, and grateful to Cyclops' X-Men for believing in her, Kitty led the X-Men of the past into joining Cyclops' X-Men.{{r|X-Men: Battle of the Atom Vol 1 2}}

====Starjammers====
After Jean Grey was abducted by the [[Shi'ar]] to be put on trial for the crimes her future self committed,{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 11.NOW}} Scott and the rest of the X-Men, along with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], went to [[Chandilar]] in order to rescue her.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 23}} During this adventure, Scott encountered the father of his future self, [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|Corsair]], and decided to leave the X-Men in order to explore space with him once Jean was rescued.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 13}}

Cyclops started to doubt his decision to leave Earth, Jean Grey and his X-companions, instead of facing his problems. When he and the Starjammers encounter, and defeat, a hostile Badoon ship, he realized that what he needs is to be by his father's side. Corsair and Cyclops then took the captured Badoon ship on a discovery journey in space.{{r|Cyclops Vol 3 1}} After reuniting with the X-Men while investigating the [[Black Vortex]] alongside the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], Scott rejoined them when they returned to Earth.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 40}}

====Road Trip====
[[File:Scott Summers (Earth-616) from All-New X-Men Vol 2 1 Cover.jpg|180px|thumb|left]]
The young X-Men decided to part ways and lay low for a while with the emergence of a new weave of anti-mutant hysteria and the beginning of the [[M-Pox]] crisis, during which Cyclops' present-self died. Cyclops initially didn't answer the calls of his friends when Beast decided to reunite the team, but eventually rejoined them after they assisted him in combating a group of misguided young Mutant extremists named the [[Ghosts of Cyclops (Earth-616)|Ghost of Cyclops]] in [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]], [[Illinois (State)|Illinois]] which Scott had been investigating during his break from the team. Even though Scott returned to superheroics, he remained deeply affected by the fate of his present self, due to the fact his final actions led him to be regarded as a terrorist and a villain worldwide.{{r|{{cl|All-New X-Men Vol 2 1}}-[[All-New X-Men Vol 2 3|3]]}} Cyclops' present-self had seemingly died fighting the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] after destroying one of their [[Terrigen Mist|Terrigen Clouds]], which were the cause of the M-Pox.{{r|Death of X Vol 1 4}}

====Champions====
Following the [[Civil War II|second superhuman civil war]], the younger members of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]], [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Spider-Man]] and [[Samuel Alexander (Earth-616)|Nova]], split from the rest of the team, disillusioned by the behavior of their elders. Together with other young heroes, they formed the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]].{{r|Champions Vol 2 1}} Ms. Marvel's call to action to the young generation to stand up for a better tomorrow resonated with Cyclops, so he decided to follow the Champions and asked them to join. Even though the young heroes were initially reluctant due to the reputation of Scott's older-self, they admitted him into their ranks.{{r|Champions Vol 2 2}}

====Inhumans vs. X-Men====
[[File:Doctor Strange Vol 4 19 ResurrXion Variant Textless.jpg|180px|thumb|right]]
Young Cyclops was one of the numerous mutants who banded together to attack the Inhumans after it was discovered the final Terrigen Cloud was weeks from being completely assimilated into Earth's atmosphere, rendering the planet uninhabitable for mutants.{{r|IVX Vol 1 1}} In the middle of the conflict, Cyclops' body was possessed by the body-snatcher Inhuman known as [[Morris Sackett (Earth-616)|Mosaic]]. While being forced to take a backseat to the control of his own body, Scott gained access to residual memories Mosaic kept of his previous victim, [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]. Through these memories, Scott learned that the death of the older Scott as well as the last act that made him infamous had been orchestrated by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]. In reality, Cyclops had died of M-Pox, and Frost used a mental projection of him to wage war in his name.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 18}}

When Cyclops regained control of his body and encountered Emma Frost, he exposed her lies to both X-Men and Inhumans, helping ease the conflict. Unfortunately, Frost escaped after the Inhuman queen [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] willingly destroyed the last remaining cloud.{{r|IVX Vol 1 6}} Even though his name had been cleared among his peers, the young Cyclops remained frustrated at the fact that the world at large still didn't know the truth, and that Emma Frost hadn't paid yet for what she had done.

Shortly after the end of the war, Beast assembled his time-displaced friends to inform them that he had found a way to go to the past. However, he intended to show them an unfortunate side discovery. He had only managed to travel to the past within the timeline they were currently inhabiting and not their own, which led to them finding this timeline's young X-Men in the past they initially believed would be available for them to return. Now certain of their inability to return to their time, the young X-Men looked forward to the new future they could build, which was no longer tied to that of their present selves.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 19}}

With a [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Young Cable]]'s<!-- Two-thousand years from now. --> help the five young mutants were returned to their own time, and Jean blocked all of their memories of future events until after they experienced the return home of their younger selves.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 5}}

===Further adventures===
Scott refused to admit, even to himself, that he had feelings for Jean, afraid he would be hurt again, or that his optic blasts would hurt her or others. Scott also believed that he could not compete with his wealthy teammate, [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]], who was also romantically interested in Jean.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 3}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 1}} What Scott did not know was that Jean actually had a crush on him too, but was too shy to make a move. Eventually they revealed their passion for each other and began to date.{{r|X-Men #60}}

When Prof. Xavier was seemingly killed, the X-Men were ordered to disband by Fred Duncan. Upon reading Prof. Xavier's will, his fortune was to be used for a trust fund, with the mansion becoming the property of the X-Men and Scott to act as a trustee for both the fund and the school.{{r|X-Men #46}} When dozens of latent mutants were summoned to [[San Francisco]] by [[Mesmero (Vincent) (Earth-616)|Mesmero]] and what seemed to be [[Magneto (Machinesmith Android) (Earth-616)|Magneto]] (actually an android duplicate), the X-Men reunited and were overpowered by the villains and their mutant army.{{r|X-Men #50}}

Scott created the cover identity of Erik the Red to infiltrate the villain organization and quickly rose to become Magneto's second in command. The X-Men were able to destroy the organization from both outside and within.{{r|X-Men #52}}

Scott was reunited with his brother Alex when the X-Men rescued Alex from the [[Ahmet Abdol (Earth-616)|Living Pharaoh]], though he refused the offer to return with Scott and the X-Men at that time. When the X-Men finally freed Alex from [[Lawrence Trask (Earth-616)|Larry Trask]] and his [[Sentinels Mk II (Earth-616)|Sentinels]], Alex accompanied his brother and joined the X-Men under the code-name Havok.{{r|X-Men #65}}

When most of his original students were captured by the sentient island-being [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], Prof. Xavier sent another team comprised of [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]]'s students, one of whom was Cyclops' long-lost brother Gabriel, aka [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Kid Vulcan]], to rescue them. After the team freed Cyclops, they were seemingly killed. Cyclops escaped, but Prof. Xavier wiped the traumatizing knowledge that his new-found brother had seemingly died saving him from Cyclops' memories.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 4|6}}

Prof. Xavier assembled another new team of X-Men, including [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]], [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], and [[John Proudstar (Earth-616)|Thunderbird]]. Scott led this new team, this time successfully rescuing the original X-Men from Krakoa.{{r|Giant-Size X-Men #1}}

When Jean Grey and the other original X-Men left the fold following the formation of the new X-Men, Cyclops stayed-on as deputy leader, feeling that he would never be able to lead a normal life because of the uncontrollable nature of his powers,{{r|X-Men #94}} though he continued to date Jean. The new team was made up of individuals and loners, such as Wolverine, who quickly developed feelings for Jean.{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 1}}

They weren’t initially working as tight a unit as the original team despite the hard training that Cyclops put them through. Thunderbird was killed in the new team’s first mission against [[Luchino Nefaria (Earth-616)|Count Nefaria]] and his [[Ani-Men (Earth-616)|Ani-Men]],{{r|X-Men #94|95}} and his death haunted Cyclops.{{r|X-Men #96}}

===The Phoenix===
Shortly after Jean left the team, she, Prof. Xavier, Wolverine, and Banshee were kidnapped by [[Stephen Lang (Earth-616)|Stephen Lang]]'s [[Sentinels Mk III (Earth-616)|Sentinels]] and taken aboard his [[Sentinel Space Station|space station]].{{r|X-Men #98|100}} After defeating Lang, the X-Men had to escape back to [[Earth]] aboard a space shuttle during a solar radiation storm. The cockpit lacked the shielding needed to protect the pilot from the lethal radiation.{{r|X-Men #100}}

Jean absorbed [[Peter Corbeau (Earth-616)|Dr. Peter Corbeau]]'s flight knowledge and volunteered to pilot. While guiding the shuttle to Earth with the other X-Men protected by the shielded part of the shuttle, the solar radiation finally proved to be too great{{r|X-Men #101}} and she began to succumb to the radiation's lethal effects.{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 8}}

However, Jean did not die. The [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] responded to Jean's anguish and telepathic calls for help. It took on the form, memories, and personality of Jean by absorbing a portion of her consciousness. The shuttle crashed into [[Jamaica Bay]] and the X-Men were shocked when "Jean" came out of the wreckage unharmed, calling herself Phoenix.{{r|X-Men #101}}

Scott had no idea the woman he loved had been replaced by a cosmic being while the real Jean [[Glossary:Suspended animation|rested]] in a cocoon at the bottom of Jamaica Bay. The Phoenix took Jean's place as a member of the X-Men and continued Jean's romance with Scott.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 1}}

The X-Men journeyed to the [[M'kraan Crystal]]'s homeworld where they met Christopher Summers, Cyclops’ long lost father, who had become a space pirate called [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|Corsair]], and leader of the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 107}} Scott still believed that his parents had died in a plane accident and was unaware that they had been captured and sold into slavery by the Shi'ar Empire. Phoenix and Storm learned of Corsair's identity, but he made them promise to keep the truth from Scott.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 109}}

Cyclops privately questioned his relationship with Jean, feeling that this reborn Jean was not the same Jean he had loved. Yet, when he mistakenly believed her dead for an extended period of time Scott was not able to mourn Jean, and believed this meant he did not really love her anymore. Scott briefly dated [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]],{{r|X-Men #122}} however, when Scott and Phoenix were reunited he rediscovered his love for her and they shared a passionate kiss on the way home. Phoenix blocked Scott's optic blast giving him the chance to see her clearly. Scott and Phoenix shared an intimate night together.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 129}}

Attempting to infiltrate the evil [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]], the Phoenix fell under [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Mastermind]] and the Hellfire Club's control. She was transformed into the Black Queen of their [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)#Inner Circle Lineups|Inner Circle]].{{r|X-Men Vol 1 132|133}}

After shaking Mastermind's control Phoenix underwent another transformation into the Dark Phoenix and soared through the universe, where she devoured an entire [[D'bari (Race)|star]] and the five billion inhabitants of one of its planets. When she returned to Earth, Phoenix threatened to kill everyone, but Cyclops still tried to reach out to her. Professor Xavier was able to keep Phoenix under control and helped her will herself back to normal. Scott finally proposed to the Phoenix as they were teleported away by the Shi'ar.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 134|136}}

The Shi'ar Empire had witnessed Dark Phoenix consuming the star and the X-Men were forced to battle with the [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]] over Phoenix's fate. The battle triggered Phoenix's transformation into Dark Phoenix once more. Phoenix understood that she would never be able to fully control the dark hunger inside and sacrificed herself on the [[Luna (Moon)|moon]]. When the Phoenix committed suicide, Scott believed the love of his life had died and he left the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 137|138}}

===Lee Forrester===
Unsure of what to do anymore, Scott signed on as crew of a fishing boat captained by [[Aleytys Forrester (Earth-616)|Lee Forrester]], who helped him work through his grief. After an adventure in which Lee's father was possessed by [[D'Spayre (Earth-616)|D'Spayre]], Cyclops and the [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]] fought D'Spayre.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 143|144}} Scott and Lee found themselves shipwrecked in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] where they stumbled upon Magneto's new base of operations and Lee aided the X-Men in defeating Magneto. Scott rejoined the team.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145|150}}

===Family Reunion===
When Corsair came to Earth for help with the [[Sidri]], Scott recognized a certain medallion that Corsair was wearing, containing pictures of the Summers family.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 154}} At first, Scott was very angry at Corsair and Storm for keeping the truth from him, but Scott came to understand and forgive his father.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 155|156}} Scott introduced Corsair to his other son, Alex.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 158}} Corsair introduced Scott to his grandparents.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 175}}

===Madelyne Pryor===
[[File:Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616) and Scott Summers (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 175 001.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Scott and Madelyne's Wedding]]
Scott's grandparents owned North Star Airways, a shipping company in [[Alaska (State)|Alaska]]. At the Summers family reunion, Scott was shocked to meet [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]], a pilot for his grandparents who was identical in appearance to Jean Grey.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 168}} Scott became obsessed with Madelyne's similarity to Jean, unaware that Madelyne was a clone of Jean created and programmed by Sinister to fall in love with Scott to make use of their potentially powerful offspring for his own purposes.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 241}} He learned that she was the sole survivor of a plane crash that happened on the exact same day that Phoenix died on the moon, another fabrication by Sinister.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 39}}

Scott began to suspect that Madelyne was a reincarnation of Phoenix.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 172}} He fell in love with her and proposed. Mastermind was stalking them and tricked Scott into believing Madelyne had turned into the Dark Phoenix. Mastermind used his illusions to make the X-Men believe Scott was the Dark Phoenix and set them against him. Following Mastermind's defeat, Scott and Madelyne were married.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 173|175}} On the way to their honeymoon, their plane crashed and they were attacked by a shark and a giant squid. This experience prompted Scott to decide not to accompany his father to the stars or remain an X-Man, but to give Madelyne a normal life. The happy couple settled in [[Anchorage]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 176}}

Scott met [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]], his daughter with Jean from an [[Earth-811|alternate future]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 199}} Rachel called herself Phoenix and wore a similar outfit as the original, a fact that Scott protested. Rachel was shocked to discover that, unlike her own timeline, Jean Grey had died and Scott Summers was married to another woman instead. Not wanting to disturb Cyclops’ marriage to Madelyne, Rachel kept her true relation to him secret. A short time later Madelyne revealed she was pregnant. Rachel, after discovering that Scott would soon be the father of a child other than her, began to tap into the Phoenix Force and vowed to restore honor to her mother's name.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 199|201}}

Madelyne bore Scott a son named [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Nathan Christopher Charles Summers]] - Nathan, from a Mister Sinister implanted suggestion in Madelyne, Christopher from Scott's father, and Charles from his father-figure Xavier. Scott was away helping the X-Men when the child was born. Rachel established a psi-bond with Nathan; she adored and loved her brother, swearing to protect her little brother as long as she lived.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 201}}

After Xavier was forced to leave Earth because of his health, Scott battled [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] for undisputed leadership of the X-Men and [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]]. After being defeated, Scott retired from the X-Men with his wife and son in Alaska.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #201}} Scott later learned that Madelyne had used her powers to influence the outcome of the battle.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 38}}

===X-Factor===
Scott and Madelyne's marriage became strained because of Scott's priorities as a member of the X-men. Madelyne resented the fact that Scott was rarely home and that he continued to miss Jean. Scott became very distant, even leaving Madelyne in the middle of the night, Madelyne grew bitter feelings during that time. Finally, the news came that Jean had been discovered alive at the bottom of the Jamaica Bay and Phoenix had been an impostor. Scott was hit hard and hid this news from Madelyne and began packing. He left Madelyne and baby Christopher despite Madelyne's warning that if he left her again, he would not be welcome back.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 263}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 286}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 1}}

After meeting with Scott in [[New York City|New York]], Jean decided that they should do something to help mutants, as she believed the X-Men had strayed from Professor Xavier's dream. Scott couldn't control his remorseful feelings. The five original X-Men founded [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]], an organization that intended to seek out and aid mutants under the pretense of hunting down mutants as menaces to society. The public assumed they were humans hunting mutants when in fact they were training young mutants in the use of their powers at the [[X-Factor Complex]].{{r|X-Factor #1}} They also worked as mutants in a team the media referred to as X-Terminators.{{r|X-Factor #8}}

Unsure what to do about Maddie, the baby, and Jean, Scott only felt useful when commanding his team. Scott attempted to contact Maddie, but the number was disconnected. At first, Scott tried to keep his marriage from Jean, but eventually the truth came out. Jean noticed that Madelyne looked exactly liked her and she became very distraught.{{r|X-Factor #7}}

The team battled [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] and his [[Alliance of Evil (Earth-616)|Alliance of Evil]]. Apocalypse would become one of Jean and the X-Factor's most persistent foes. He would soon be responsible for turning their teammate and friend Angel against them as the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horseman]] of Death.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 15}}{{r|{{cl|X-Factor Vol 1 17}}-[[X-Factor Vol 1 24|24]]}}

After beginning to fear for Madelyne's safety and feeling bad about abandoning his family, Scott went back to Alaska to look for them. Scott was unaware of Sinister's influence on his life. Sinister sent the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] to kill her and collect Nathan for him. She was shot multiple times and fell into a coma. She was taken to the hospital as a Jane Doe. Sinister erased every record of Madelyne and the baby.{{r|X-Factor #13}} After finding the corpse of a young red-head in a river, Scott believed his wife was dead and buried her by himself.{{r|X-Factor #15}}

Scott began to hallucinate and believe Jean, Madelyne, and the Phoenix Force had been the same woman all along. Scott's visions nearly led him to kill Jean before it was discovered they were actually holograms created by [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]], the public relations manager of X-Factor trying to destroy them.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 17|18}}

Scott and Jean began to grow close again as friends.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 26}} Scott and Jean returned to the site on the moon where Phoenix had committed suicide and Jean acknowledged that Scott loved Phoenix and she had loved him and it really hurt her even more.{{r|X-Factor Annual Vol 1 2}} Meanwhile, Madelyne Pryor awoke from her coma and contacted the X-Men who agreed to protect her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 215}}

X-Factor brought Angel out of his brainwashing. After their defeat of Apocalypse, his sentient [[Prosh (Earth-616)|Ship]] crash-landed on their [[X-Factor Complex|Complex]], and X-Factor began living in it. X-Factor finally revealed the truth of their mutant origins and shed their disguise of mutant hunters.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 25}} After saving the city from a series of fires from their battle with Apocalypse, X-Factor was given a ticker-tape parade.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 26}}

===Inferno===
Scott saw Madelyne and the X-Men sacrificing themselves in [[Dallas]] on TV.{{r|X-Factor #27}} Her last words were asking him to find their son. Scott had not only lost his wife but also his younger brother Alex. Using cryptic clues provided by [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny]], Scott and Jean returned to the orphanage Scott grew up in and found an entire laboratory in the basement with many children, including baby Christopher, in incubation pods. Scott and Jean battled [[Nanny (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Nanny]] and [[Orphan-Maker (Peter) (Earth-616)|Orphan-Maker]] for Scott's son, only to fail to prevent demons from snatching him. They had a happy moment as a family, Jean's feelings for the baby growing fonder.{{r|X-Factor #35}} 

After returning to New York, Scott and Jean were reunited with X-Factor and fought countless demons. X-Factor's search for Christopher led them to the demon responsible, [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N’Astirh]], and Madelyne appeared with him calling herself the Goblin Queen. Scott was shocked to find out that his wife was alive. Madelyne started a fight, blaming Scott and Jean for the misery in her life. She had seduced Alex and made him her Goblin Prince.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #239|243}}{{r|X-Factor #36|39}} After N'astirh attacked, X-Factor and the X-Men combined efforts to defeat him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 242}}

The Goblin Queen attempted to sacrifice baby Nathan atop the [[Empire State Building]] to permanently open a gateway between Earth and [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]] to spite Scott. The Goblin Queen locked herself, Nathan, and Jean inside a psionic barrier. The invasion was thwarted after Madelyne committed suicide in combat with Jean. Jean learned Sinister had cloned Madelyne from Jean. Madelyne had been given life and awareness by a portion of the Phoenix Force Jean had rejected, that had copied Jean’s personality and memories. Sinister had then programmed Madelyne to fall in love with Scott, planning to make use of their potentially powerful offspring for his own evil purposes.{{r|X-Factor #38}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 241}}

Jean was forced to reintegrate the portion of herself that Phoenix had given to Madelyne. In the process Jean also got Madelyne's and Phoenix’s memories and personalities too. Scott finally learned that Mister Sinister had run the orphanage in which he was raised, provided the ruby-quartz lenses, and his role in Madelyne's creation. Scott appeared to kill Sinister with an optic blast. Scott, Jean, and Christopher grew closer as a family. {{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 243}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 39}}

===Gaining a Family===
Scott decided to take Nathan with him on missions.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 41}} Nathan's other mutant powers began to manifest as a protective force bubble whenever he was in danger.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 48}} Scott and Jean both taught Christopher to use his powers.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 59}} Later, Scott proposed to Jean only to be turned down. Jean now carried the memories of Scott‘s earlier proposals to both Phoenix and Madelyne; she was distraught to gain those memories and needed time to be sure their relationship was their own decision, not preordained.{{r|X-Factor #53}} Scott and Jean finally learned that Rachel was actually their adult daughter from an alternate timeline. They introduced Christopher to his sister.{{r|X-Factor Annual Vol 1 5}}{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 14}}

===Losing a Son===
The [[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Riders of the Storm]] kidnapped Nathan and took him to Apocalypse's base on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 67}} Apocalypse infected the child with the [[Techno-Organic Virus]], that was rapidly spreading through his body and, if not stopped, would kill him. A woman from the [[Earth-4935|late 37th-early 39th century]] appeared calling herself [[Jen Askani (Earth-4935)|Sister Askani]]. She claimed to be a member of the [[Clan Askani (Earth-4935)|Clan Askani]] that had technology in her future that might be able to save Nathan. However, she could only risk one time jump without destroying herself. Distraught, Cyclops chose to send his son into the future rather than watch him die in the present. Scott and Jean both were very hurt seeing their son go. For some time, Scott had no way of knowing if Askani's cure had been successful.{{r|X-Factor #68}}

===Returning to the X-Men===
The [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] returned and together the X-Men and X-Factor defeated him.{{r|X-Factor #69}} X-Factor disbanded and all five original X-Men rejoined Prof. X and returned to his school. Scott became leader of a newly created "Blue Team"{{r|X-Men Vol 2 1}} while Jean served on the "Gold Team". [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] began calling Scott "Fearless Leader". Fellow Blue Team member and telepath [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] tried to lure Cyclops into infidelity, influencing his mind behind Jean's back.

Prof. Xavier and Scott asked Alex to lead the new government sponsored [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]. Meanwhile, a mysterious soldier called Cable had reorganized the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]], Xavier's junior mutant team, into an outlaw team called [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]].{{Citation}}

===X-Cutioner's Song===
Mister Sinister returned, this time posing as Apocalypse and commanding his Horsemen. Sinister sent the Horsemen of Apocalypse to capture Cyclops and Jean and then turned the couple over to [[Nathan Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]]{{r|Uncanny X-Men #294}} in exchange for a canister containing a genetic matrix he was led to believe contained [[Summers Family|Summers' family]] genetic material.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 14}} Stryfe was a madman and rival of Cable. Torturing Scott and Jean, Stryfe claimed that he was Scott's son Nathan returned from the future and seeking revenge for being abandoned. Scott and Jean were both upset and they tried to convince him that they did it for his own good. Stryfe claimed that Cable, who shared the same face as Stryfe, was a clone of Nathan. On the lunar surface of the moon, Cable and Stryfe both vanished into the time-stream after a temporal device exploded. Scott thought he had lost his son a second time.{{r|X-Force #18}} 

===Legacy Virus===
After Psylocke passionately kissed Scott he took a leave from the X-Men to meet with his grandparents in Alaska.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 20}} Mister Sinister returned, this time in the guise of a neighbor of Scott's grandparents, Mr. Mulbury. Sinister informed Scott that instead of the genetic matrix he had desired, Stryfe had betrayed him and given him the deadly mutant killing [[Legacy Virus]] which Sinister had accidentally released. Sinister let slip that there was another Summers brother but did not name Gabriel.{{Citation}}

Suddenly, Apocalypse's [[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Dark Riders]] appeared to test Scott's worthiness. Sinister aided Scott against the Dark Riders for a brief time before teleporting away.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 23}} By the time Scott returned home to the X-Men, Colossus' little sister [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Illyana]] had already succumbed to the Legacy Virus, and more deaths were to come.{{Citation}}

===Cable's Return===
Cable found his way back to the present. Mr. Sinister appeared and informed Cable that Stryfe had been wrong about their origins. Stryfe was the clone. Cable was Nathan Summers. Sinister also informed Cable that Tolliver, an arms dealer who Cable and X-Force had had run-ins with, was none other than Cable's adopted son [[Tyler Dayspring (Earth-4935)|Tyler Dayspring]]. Cable believed Stryfe had been killed, however, Stryfe had actually survived as a consciousness in the back of Cable's mind. Sinister allowed Stryfe to gain control of Cable's body. Tyler and Stryfe both learned their true origins, but the knowledge was too much for Stryfe to handle and he refused to believe it. Cyclops, Jean, Xavier, and [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] convinced Stryfe to expel himself from Cable's mind. Tyler escaped in the confusion. When Cable was himself again he asked Scott about his mother before leaving. Scott finally had most of his answers at last, but was left with unresolved issues. Scott and Jean both wanted a relationship with their son.{{r|Cable #8}}

[[File:X-Men Vol 2 30 Remastered Wraparound Textless.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Scott and Jean's wedding]]
Jean proposed to Scott and he happily agreed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #308}} During the night of his bachelor party Scott was alerted that there was an intruder in the Danger Room. Scott found Cable there viewing a hologram of when he was given to the Askani by his father. Originally put-off by Scott's eagerness to relinquish his son forever, Cable came to respect his father after seeing a hologram of Scott's agonizing response after his decision.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #310}}

Scott and his longtime love were finally married.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 30}} Afterwards, on the other side of the world and away from Scott's notice, Rachel Summers sacrificed herself to exile in the timestream to save her [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] teammate [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]].{{r|Excalibur #75}} Rachel surfaced two thousand years in the future where Apocalypse ruled by his survival of the fittest world view.

===Slym Dayspring===
[[File:Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Vol 1 4.jpg|left|thumb|180px|The Daysprings]]
While on their honeymoon on the beaches of [[Saint Barthélemy|Saint Barts]], the consciousnesses of Scott and Jean were taken 2000 years into the [[Earth-4935|future]] by an elderly Rachel, who had become the Clan Askani's matriarch [[Rachel Summers (Mother Askani) (Earth-811)|Mother Askani]] after the Phoenix Force had abandoned her years earlier. As their own bodies could not have survived time travel Scott and Jean inhabited new bodies cloned from their descendants.{{r|Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Vol 1 1}}

Rachel had taken them to the moment right after Scott's young son Nathan, the boy who would one day become Cable, had first arrived in the future infected with a techno-organic virus after Scott had sent him there to find a possible cure. The techno-organic virus was spreading and could only be held in check with telekinesis.{{r|{{cl|Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Vol 1 1}}-[[Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Vol 1 4|4]]}}

Under the aliases of Redd and Slym Dayspring, Jean and Scott raised the boy together while Rachel was lying in a coma, held alive by machines. Slym and Redd never told Nathan of their true origins or his. They joined the Askani-inspired [[Clan Rebellion (Earth-4935)|Clan Rebellion]] to undermine [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-4935)|Apocalypse]]'s empire. Meanwhile, a virus-free clone of Nathan was grown from Nathan's healthy cells in case the virus killed him. The clone had been captured by Apocalypse who named him Stryfe and raised him to be his new host vessel for the next time Apocalypse needed to switch bodies.{{r|{{cl|Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Vol 1 1}}-[[Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Vol 1 4|4]]}}

After twelve years Nate, Slym, and Redd stopped Apocalypse from killing Stryfe and destroyed him once and for all. On that day, Rachel finally died of old age. Scott and Jean were sent back to their rightful bodies in the present, leaving Nate alone and Stryfe under the care of Apocalypse's former servant [[Ch'Vayre (Earth-4935)|Ch'vayre]], who promised to try to raise Stryfe properly.{{r|{{cl|Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Vol 1 1}}-[[Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Vol 1 4|4]]}}

Back in the present, Cyclops and Jean revealed to Cable that they had raised him in the future as Slym and Redd Dayspring. Cable had known for some time and was waiting for them to be ready to tell him. They were pleased to be reunited as a family.{{r|Cable #20}} Back at the school, Scott and Jean moved into the former boathouse.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #318}} Scott offered Cable and X-Force a home at the mansion.{{r|X-Men Prime #1}} Jean began calling herself Phoenix again to honor Rachel's final request. 

===Adam-X===
Accompanying Scott to Alaska to check on his [[Philip Summers (Earth-616)|grandfather]] in the hospital, Jean happened upon [[Adam Neramani (Earth-616)|Adam-X]] and sensed that there was a connection between Adam and the Summers family. Adam allowed Jean to transfer memories of his days as a Shi'ar combat pilot to Phillip. Afterward, Adam disappeared and Jean decided not to reveal her encounter to Scott.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 39}}

===Onslaught===
Scott and Jean were teleported to [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]'s space station [[Avalon (Greymalkin) (Earth-616)|Avalon]] by [[Amelia Voght (Earth-616)|Amelia Voght]]. They were unable to prevent the destruction of the base and it crash-landed in the [[Australia]]n Outback. Scott helped Magneto's [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]] reach the X-Men's abandoned [[Cooterman's Creek|base]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 44}}

The X-Men were forced to battle their mentor and Scott's father figure when Professor Xavier was transformed into the evil [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]] as a result of his attempt to mind-wipe Magneto.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 53}} Although the X-Men defeated the evil entity and freed Prof. Xavier, most of Earth's heroes were lost for a time. Prof. Xavier was left powerless after Onslaught's defeat and was arrested for his role in the events. Scott and Jean were left as the leaders of the X-Men and co-headmasters of the school.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 57}}

===1759===
Cyclops and Jean were sent back in time to [[London (England)|London]] in the year 1759 by [[Tanya Trask (Earth-616)|Madame Sanctity]]. They believed that they were there to prevent Nathaniel Essex from becoming Mr. Sinister. However, Sinister was necessary for the birth of Nathan Dayspring, the Askani'son, who Madame Sanctity worshiped. She had sent them to the past to stop Apocalypse from conquering [[England]].

===The "Loss" of a Brother===
Scott's brother Alex was brainwashed by the [[Henry McCoy (Earth-295)|Dark Beast]] and betrayed X-Factor. Havok founded a team of mutant terrorists called the [[Brotherhood (Havok) (Earth-616)|Brotherhood]]. However, Havok did not truly become a terrorist. He joined the Brotherhood in order to stop the Dark Beast's sinister plans. Havok tried to kill [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J.J. Jameson]] and nearly killed Scott in a free-for-all battle. Storm saved Scott but Havok teleported and escaped.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #339}} Later, Scott believed Havok was killed when his body was destroyed in an accident, but his mind was actually transported to another reality. 

===Operation: Zero Tolerance===
The government-sponsored mutant-hunting operation known as "[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]" took effect and the villainous [[Bastion (Earth-616)|Bastion]] captured the X-Men Cyclops, Storm, Wolverine, [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]], and Jean.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 65}} [[Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate (Earth-616)|SHIELD]] shut the operation down, but not before Bastion could place a nanotech bomb inside Scott's chest.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 115}} The X-Men's newest member, a mutant doctor named [[Cecilia Reyes (Earth-616)|Cecilia Reyes]], saved Scott's life.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 70}} 

===Semi-Retirement===
Afterwards Scott and Jean took a leave of absence from the X-Men for him to recuperate.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 71}} On the plane ride to Alaska, Scott and Jean briefly battled a battalion of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] soldiers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #352}} While on leave, Scott called the original X-Men together to reassess Professor Xavier's dream of peaceful co-existence between mutants and humans.

Scott then began to grow weary as Jean began to wear the same costume her Phoenix double had worn. She manifested the Phoenix flamebird while training.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #356}} Scott began to worry that the Phoenix had returned before Jean lost her psi-powers as a result of the Psi-War. With neither of them at their strongest, the couple stayed in retirement together and the matter of the Phoenix Force's return was dropped for a time. Professor X then returned to the X-Men in their absence.

===Nate Grey===
Scott and Jean were visited by the time-tossed powerful mutant teenager known as [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]]. Nate was Scott and Jean's son from an [[Earth-295|alternate reality]]. Essentially, Nate was a younger version of Cable. With the bonds between Nate and his parents strengthened, Scott presented Nate with one of his old X-Factor uniforms.

===Apocalypse and The Twelve===
Scott and Jean returned to the X-Men some time after at the request of Storm. Storm was concerned about the mental well-being of Professor X.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #375}} Xavier had been pretending to lose control in order to uncover a traitor he had sensed in the ranks of the X-Men. The traitor turned out to be a [[James Howlett (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Skrull]] who had replaced Wolverine. A plot hatched by Apocalypse and the [[Skrulls]] was uncovered. 

Apocalypse made a bid for cosmic power by assembling "[[Twelve (Mutants) (Earth-616)|The Twelve]]" - a group of mutants who would determine the fate of their kind that included Scott, Phoenix, [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], Professor X, Storm, Magneto, the [[Ahmet Abdol (Earth-616)|Living Monolith]], [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]], [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], Sunfire, [[Mikhail Rasputin (Earth-616)|Mikhail Rasputin]], Nate Grey, and Cable. To secure a new host body, Apocalypse sought to collect the mutants he required to carry out his plan and siphon the awesome energies of "The Twelve". They were wired to a machine that would channel the Twelve's awesome energies into Apocalypse, allowing him to absorb the body of Nate Grey.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #377}} 

As his teammates fell around him, a powerless Scott saved Nate and merged with the would-be conqueror to create a new evil entity.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 97}} Jean detected Scott's psyche inside Apocalypse and prevented the X-Men from destroying him, however, he was presumed dead by most of his teammates.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #378}} Only Jean and Cable refused to believe Scott had perished, at which time Cable joined the X-Men to honor his father.{{r|Cable #85}}
[[File:Scott Summers (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 391 001.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Resurrected Cyclops]]

In Scott's absence, Cable found Rachel alive and young at the end of time. The Phoenix Force had abandoned her. Cable brought Rachel back to the present with him. Rachel asked Cable to keep her return secret while she tried to get her life back together.{{r|Cable #86}}

Investigating rumors he was alive, Jean and Cable found Scott in the birthplace of Apocalypse in Akkaba, [[Egypt]], struggling to reassert his mind over the villain's psyche. Jean exorcised the warlord from Cyclops and Cable shattered his essence. Thanks to the support of his wife and adopted family, Scott was able to shake off the devastating effects of his merger with Apocalypse and rejoin the X-Men.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: The Search for Cyclops Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Men: The Search for Cyclops Vol 1 4|4]]}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #391}}

Himself again, Scott left for a small period of recuperation, during which he reconciled with his father.

===Emma Frost===
[[File:New X-Men Vol 1 118 Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Cyclops returns after possession]]
Afterwards, Scott returned to the X-Men, but his association with Apocalypse had given him a grimmer, more serious personality than ever before. As a result, many of his relationships became strained, including his marriage to Jean. Apocalypse made him question not only their relationship, but his life as a whole. 

Following the outing of Professor X as a mutant to the world while secretly under the influence of [[Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-616)|Cassandra Nova]], his school opened its doors to the mutant population at large. Xavier/Nova left Earth and Jean was left as Headmistress of the school.{{r|New X-Men #117}} When Jean began to show signs of manifesting the Phoenix Force, Scott only further distanced himself from her. Jean, confused by the change in their relationship, confided in Logan and the two kissed in the woods outside the school, but Logan walked away, telling her that she should remain with Scott.{{r|New X-Men #117}} Jean's new responsibilities, along with her growing powers, forced her to put her attention elsewhere, leaving Scott feeling ignored and his trauma from being possessed trivialized.{{r|New X-Men #122}}

Scott was instrumental in preventing the mutant [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Kuan-Yin Xorn]]'s suicide and in recruiting the powerful mutant to the X-Men.{{r|New X-Men #127}} Scott abstained from having sex with Jean for five months, and even after Jean attempted several times to confront Cyclops, he continued to push her away. That made Jean feel that Scott didn't want her anymore. Scott sought the help of qualified therapist, [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]],{{r|New X-Men #128}} once known as the White Queen and a former villain who had reformed and joined the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #318}} Their relationship ostensibly began as a series of psychic therapy sessions, but Emma took advantage of this situation to get close to Scott and, under the guise of counseling him, she was able to instigate a telepathic affair.{{r|New X-Men #131}}

[[File:Emma Frost (Earth-616) & Scott Summers (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 1 139 001.png|thumb|180px|right|Jean discovering Emma and Scott's telepathic love affair]]
When Jean discovered the affair,{{r|New X-Men #138}} her hurt feelings grew and she forced Emma to admit her true feelings. Furious at both himself and Jean, Scott confronted Jean and demanded she read his mind and she finally complied. Jean discovered that Scott and Emma never engaged in any physical contact, even though Emma had offered it. Scott, who felt he could not get through to his angry and hurt wife, subsequently left the X-Men to mull over what was happening in his life. Jean considered a separation.{{r|New X-Men #139}}

Scott soon found himself at the Hellfire Club, which had been turned into a sleazy strip club, and tried to get drunk, attempting to escape the responsibilities, expectations, and demands he felt were unjustly placed on him by the X-Men. Scott accompanied Wolverine and [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]] to the government-created, time-pocket called [[The World]], and then [[Asteroid M]]. During his time with Wolverine, Scott revealed that he felt his relationship with Jean was stagnant and that the two of them had not progressed romantically since their initial teenage romance.{{r|New X-Men #142}} Repeated missions with Wolverine resulted in the growth of a tentative friendship between the two veteran X-Men.

[[File:New X-Men Vol 1 156 Textless.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Emma and Scott]]
When Scott returned, the sentient DNA, known as [[Sublime (Earth-616)|John Sublime]], had taken control of Xorn (who wore the guise of Magneto). Xorn attacked the X-Men and killed Jean in the process. As she was dying, Scott apologized for hurting her, but Jean instead told him that she understood and had never seen him more alive and urged him to live on.{{r|New X-Men #150}} Scott was devastated by Jean's death. He considered leaving the X-Men once more,{{r|New X-Men #155}} but the [[Jean Grey (Earth-15104)|Jean]] of an [[Earth-15104|alternate future]] telepathically intervened in an attempt to prevent her dark future from coming to pass. She urged Scott to live, and to allow himself to be happy with Emma.

Cyclops and Emma formalized their relationship{{r|New X-Men #154}} and together the pair rebuilt the Xavier Institute as co-headmasters, as Prof. Xavier had decided to relocate to [[Genosha]].{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 1}} Cyclops also tutored a squad at the institute called the [[Corsairs Squad (Earth-616)|Corsairs]], named after his father. The team consisted of [[Callie Betto (Earth-616)|Dryad]], [[Maxwell Jordan (Earth-616)|Quill]], [[Dallas Gibson (Earth-616)|Specter]], and the three remaining [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]].

Initially, several of their teammates were none too happy with their relationship because they felt that Cyclops and Emma were insulting the memory of Jean and the love she and Scott once shared. As a result, Wolverine flatly insulted and fought Scott,{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 1}} Beast stated that he no longer liked him,{{r|New X-Men #155}} and Rachel Summers, in particular, felt hurt and angry by her father's lack of remorse for the psychic affair that Jean discovered before her death, and Emma's part in it. Rachel then changed her last name to Grey for her mother's memory.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #445}} The other X-Men, eventually, came to accept the relationship and both Scott and Emma managed to reconcile with Rachel in their own ways, such as introducing Rachel to Jean's other family members, family that she did not get a chance to meet in her own timeline.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 165}}

===Astonishing X-Men===
Deciding that the X-Men needed to play a more proactive role in emergency rescue and aid, and thus garner attention for mutants in a more positive light by showing that mutant powers could be used for the good of the world, Cyclops handpicked a team in order to get out into the world more. Scott chose Beast for his intelligence, Emma for her telepathy in the field, Wolverine because of his fighting experience, and [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]] as the public face of mutants.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 1}} The remaining teams were left in the charge of Havok and Storm. The teams' first mission was against an alien, named [[Ord (SWORD) (Earth-616)|Ord]] of the [[Breakworld]], during which the team rescued the recently resurrected [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] and destroyed a cure for mutants.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 6}}

===Danger===
Not long after, the X-Men's Danger Room became sentient, attacking the X-Men and seeking to kill Prof. Xavier.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 7}} Calling itself [[Danger (Earth-616)|"Danger"]], "she" revealed that Prof. Xavier knew she had been self-aware since the Shi'ar technology was installed in the Danger Room years ago, but chose to ignore her, effectively, inhumanely using her only to train his teams of X-Men. After her defeat on the island of Genosha, the X-Men abandoned Prof. Xavier on the island in disgust, and Cyclops stated that he no longer needed Prof. Xavier's input at the school or with the team.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 12}}

===M-Day===
After the events of [[Earth-58163|House of M]], nearly all mutants were left de-powered with no more mutant births, and Prof. Xavier went missing. Mutants became an endangered species. Against the wishes of co-headmasters Scott and Emma, the government assigned [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E (Earth-616)|Sentinel Squad O*N*E]] to protect the mansion and its inhabitants. With few mutants left after M-Day, Cyclops opened the Xavier Institute’s estate as a refuge camp, set up for any mutant who needed protection or a place to stay.{{r|X-Men: The 198 #1}}

===Deadly Genesis===
The energy previously possessed by the depowered mutants was orbiting Earth after the events of M-Day. While passing some orbiting rocks, the energy awakened Vulcan (Gabriel Summers). Vulcan, shocked that Scott did not recognize him, attacked and easily defeated several members of the X-Men and kidnapped Cyclops and Rachel{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #1}} and revealed himself to be Cyclops' younger brother. When Scott asked why he did not remember any of the events, Professor Xavier confirmed that the memories were not in Scott's mind anymore because he had erased them. Vulcan escaped, stating that he despised what the X-Men had become and did not consider Scott or Alex his brothers anymore. This further damaged Cyclops' already strained relationship with his mentor and he demanded that Prof. Xavier leave the school, as it was no longer "his".{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #6}}

===The Truth Revealed===
During an impromptu telepathic "therapy session", while Emma was being influenced by Cassandra Nova, Emma presented Cyclops with the possibility that his lack of control over his optic blasts actually stemmed from a sort of mental block that the young Scott imposed upon himself, after the combined traumas of the loss of his parents, separation from his brother, and the shocking manifestation of his powers. This was seen as a coping mechanism, giving Scott something to focus on and try to maintain some sort of control over, at a time when events completely out of his control had effectively shattered the life he had led. Using this information to weaken his resolve, surprisingly, Scott seemed to admit that this theory was the truth of the matter, further admitting that he had even blocked making this decision out of his memory, to preserve the fallacy in his own mind and prevent others from discovering his "secret".{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 14}} Even though stronger telepaths like Jean Grey and Prof. Xavier shared a longer common history with Scott, Emma Frost was able to root this out of his mind. It can safely be speculated that Emma was able to do so, in part, due to her highly refined telepathic skills and, in part, due to the fact that she was able to bring Cyclops to a point of shamelessly opening up his true self to her, something Jean and the Professor never accomplished. For a short time, Scott had full control over his optical blasts, although it was only temporary. Scott was also temporarily killed and resurrected on a mission to Ord's Breakworld.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 23}}

===Messiah Complex===
When the first new mutant baby (later called [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]]) since M-Day was born, the Marauders and the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] tried to claim her.{{r|X-Men: Messiah Complex #1}} Upon discovering that Cable had kidnapped the new born mutant, Cyclops ordered the reformation of [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]], with Wolverine leading the team to hunt down Cable and retrieve the baby. Bishop feared the child would become an evil monster responsible for his dark future. He infected the O*N*E Sentinels that guarded the mansion with nanites and in the fight that ensued, the X-Mansion was destroyed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #493}}

The search for the mutant messiah ended when Prof. Xavier convinced Cyclops to allow Cable to escape to the future with the baby. Cable teleported to the future, just as Bishop fired a round at the child. The shot missed her and hit Prof. Xavier in the head. Cyclops struck Bishop with an optic blast and declared the X-Men disbanded.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 207}}

===San Francisco===
Cyclops and Emma were successful in rescuing San Francisco from the mutant known as [[Martinique Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Goddess]]. As a result, the mayor of the city, [[Sadie Sinclair (Earth-616)|Sadie Sinclair]], offered to help the X-Men establish themselves in the city. After building a new headquarters, [[Graymalkin Industries]], Cyclops sent word to all the world's mutants that San Francisco was now a safe haven for mutantkind and that all were welcomed to join them. San Francisco's population openly welcomed the X-Men, even though a resurrected [[Graydon Creed (Earth-616)|Graydon Creed]] and assorted other previously dead foes began pushing to outlaw mutant reproduction. The new anti-mutant propaganda caused an explosion of hate crimes on mutants and former mutants.

Scott and Storm went to the [[Morlock Tunnels]] of [[New York]] to bring them to San Francisco.{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #1}} There, he was possessed by the Shadow King and tried to kill the X-Men in an attempt to force Storm to choose between being an X-Man or the ruler of [[Wakanda]]. After being shot by a bolt of lighting, the Shadow King left Scott and Storm revived him with C.P.R.{{r|X-Men: Worlds Apart #4}}

Cyclops' attitude became more "kill or be killed", during this time, as he reformed X-Force as a black ops hit squad while keeping their existence secret.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 1}} First, Scott ordered Wolverine to eliminate [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] for her part in nearly killing the Messiah Baby,{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 62}} then the Purifiers,{{r|X-Force Vol 3 1}} and Bishop. He opted the kills over saving the lives of [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom-Boom]], [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]], and [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]] from the [[Leper Queen (Earth-616)|Leper Queen]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 13}} Scott ordered the use of a variation of the mutant Legacy Virus as biological warfare against the Skrulls, during their [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] of San Francisco.{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men #4}}

===Madelyne's Return===
Scott encountered his ex-wife Madelyne again when she inexplicably returned as a psychic ghost. Calling herself the Red Queen she attacked the X-Men with a newly assembled all-female team of mutants, the [[Sisterhood of Mutants (Earth-616)|Sisterhood]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #508}} Madelyne stole a lock of Jean's hair from Wolverine with the goal of using it to locate and inhabit Jean's body, allowing Madelyne to be reborn.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #509}} Scott employed Domino to exhume Jean's grave and swap her body with another. Unaware of the switch and spurning Scott's attempt to reach out to her, Madelyne attempted to possess the body, but seemingly disintegrated into nothingness as no other body than Jean's could house an entity of Madelyne's level of power. 

===Utopia===
Footage of [[Cooperstown]], Alaska from Hope's birth was eventually released to the media by [[Simon Trask (Earth-616)|Simon Trask]], designed to deceive the public into believing that the destruction was caused by the newborn mutant messiah rather than the Purifiers. The footage, coupled with Trask's newly formed Humanity Now!, led to violent rioting from mutants against the anti-mutant coalition in San Francisco. Though supported by the mayor, Cyclops was largely viewed as the leader of the remaining mutant population by the media and he took the brunt of negative media and public opinion, implicated as endorsing and sending the X-Men to lead the rioting. Trask capitalized on the hysteria, portraying Humanity Now! as victims of oppression, in order to push [[Proposition X]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #505}} 

[[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]], leader of [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]], called in the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]] to stop the riots and ordered the arrest of Cyclops and his team of X-Men, calling in Emma to lead a new team of [[X-Men (Osborn) (Earth-616)|Dark X-Men]]. Emma agreed to lead the team, secretly working as a double-agent against Osborn. Emma discovered that Dark Beast had created a machine to torture apprehended mutants and channel their powers into [[Michael Pointer (Earth-616)|Weapon Omega]]. Scott had Magik teleport X-Force into H.A.M.M.E.R.'s [[Alcatraz Island]], where they took on the Dark X-Men and Dark Avengers, while Magik teleported all the captured mutants to safety. 

Immediately after, Scott had the [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]] resurface Asteroid M, which had crashed into the Pacific Coast a few years prior. Cyclops moved every X-Man and allied mutant to the asteroid, which he now called [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]]. During a press conference, Cyclops informed the world that they had left the [[United States Of America|United States]] and that they rejected Norman Osborn and his methods. Magneto soon joined the ranks of the X-Men, humbly stating that Scott had succeeded in uniting the mutant race where he and Xavier had failed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #516}}

===Second Coming===
Cable and a teenage Hope returned from the future. Cyclops made their safe passage to Utopia the X-Men's top priority while Bastion made Hope's demise his.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming #1}} Nightcrawler sacrificed himself to get Hope back to Utopia.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 26}} Bastion opened a time portal to his own [[Earth-811|time]] to send an endless wave of [[Nimrod (Sentinel)|Nimrod Sentinels]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy #236}} Cyclops ordered X-Force through the portal to halt the horde of Nimrods pouring through.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 27}} They were successful, but Cable had to sacrifice himself so X-Force could return to their own time. Angered at the loss of her father figure, Hope destroyed Bastion and blamed Scott for Cable's death.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 28}} Scott buried the remains of his son.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming #2}}

[[File:X-Men Prelude to Schism Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Cyclops]]
Scott took full responsibility for X-Force's actions and the deaths of every X-Man since the birth of Hope and ordered X-Force to disband.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming #2}} Scott was forgiven by most. Beast left, blaming Cyclops for Nightcrawler's death and his increasingly militant attitude towards protecting the mutant species at all costs. Commander [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]] stated that after saving all of the human and mutant lives from Bastion, it was time for the X-Men to step into the light.{{r|Uncanny X-Men: The Heroic Age #1}} Scott was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom from the [[Barack Obama (Earth-616)|President]]. 

===[[Schism (Event)|Schism]]===
[[File:X-Men Schism Vol 1 4 Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Cyclops vs. Wolverine]]
After [[Kade Kilgore (Earth-616)|Kilgore]] and the New Hellfire Club sent a massive Sentinel towards Utopia, Cyclops and Wolverine had a falling out regarding whether or not to have the children defend the island or evacuate. The disagreement led to a bloody fight between them, and despite the fact that the children defeated the Sentinel, Wolverine decided to leave Utopia, resettle in [[Westchester County]], and reform the school.

Cyclops formed his [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|Extinction Team]], composed of the strongest members of the X-Men, to perform super heroics and send a message to the world that the mutants would be victims no longer.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 1}} Their first challenge was to defend San Francisco against a newly resurrected Mister Sinister who, using the [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|Dreaming Celestial]], managed to convert every human into a copy of him. He was eventually defeated and the X-Men received the Dreaming Celestial's blessing as Earth's protectors.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 4}}

===[[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers vs. X-Men]]===
When [[Samuel Alexander (Earth-616)|Nova]] crashed in New York, he gave the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] a cryptic warning: "It's Coming". Thanks to this, the Avengers discovered that the Phoenix Force was burning a path through the universe on its way to Earth. Meanwhile, Cyclops sparred with Hope repeatedly, training her harshly. When she asked why and he refused to give a straight answer Hope flared up with the power of the Phoenix, which the Avengers detected. Captain America consulted Wolverine, who told him of Hope Summers.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Steven Rogers (Earth-616) Scott Summers (Earth-616) Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 1.png|thumb|200px|left|The first blow is struck: Cyclops blasts Captain America after refusing to hand over Hope]]
Cyclops became convinced that the coming of the Phoenix Force would herald the rebirth of mutantkind as a species. Captain America saw it as the herald of Earth's destruction, and so arrived on Utopia with the intent of taking Hope into protective custody. After arguing Cyclops refused Captain America, blasting him into the ocean.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Scott Summers (Earth-616) and Steven Rogers (Earth-616) from Avengers vs X-Men Vol 1 2 0001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cyclops vs. Captain America: Leaders fight]]
[[File:Scott Summers (Earth-616) and Steven Rogers (Earth-616) from Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 2 0002.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Last chance: Cap makes final plea to Cyke]]
In response, a [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]] uncloaked itself and the Avengers began an invasion of Utopia.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 1}} After a pitched battle, the X-Men surrendered and the Avengers begin to make plans for capturing Hope. This was all a ploy however and Cyclops and the X-Men teleport away, giving them a head start in capturing Hope. Cyclops also contacted his daughter Rachel and convinced her to feed the Avengers false information which sent them on wild goose chases.{{r|{{cl|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 2}}-[[Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 3|3]]}} He proceeded to travel to the Jean Grey Institute in order to offer Wolverine one last chance to change sides as well as recruit anyone willing to fight alongside their fellow mutants.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 10}}

After finding out that Hope was heading to the Moon together with Wolverine, Cyclops gathered Emma Frost, Magik, [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]], and Colossus and teleported to the Moon in order to confront the Avengers. Before a fight broke out, [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] fell from the skies, closely followed by the Phoenix.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 4}} A fight broke out between the X-Men and the Avengers while [[Iron Man (Anthony "Tony" Stark)|Iron Man]] built a weapon to fight the Phoenix. Iron Man attacked the Phoenix but instead of destroying it, the Phoenix turned the five X-Men into its [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|avatars]]. Cyclops and the rest of the avatars then took Hope back to Earth in order to prepare her.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 5}}

[[File:Phoenix Five (Earth-616) and Hope Summers (Earth-616) from Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 5 0001.png|thumb|180px|left|The Phoenix Five emerge with Hope]]
Scott and his fellow hosts began reshaping the world into a better place to live, outlawing wars and providing food, water, and energy to the entire world. The Avengers continued to oppose them however and after they convinced Hope to leave with them, Cyclops feared that they planned to use her as a weapon against them and declared "No more Avengers".{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 6}}

Despite fighting the Avengers, Cyclops insisted that none of them be harmed to the ire of his fellow Phoenix, Namor. After finding out that the Avengers were hiding out in Wakanda, Emma told Namor but neglected to tell anyone else. Namor stormed Wakanda and was narrowly defeated by the Avengers. After being knocked out, Namor's portion of the Phoenix left him and went to the four remaining hosts.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 7|8}}

With her increased powers, Emma was able to sense where the Avengers had taken Hope. She told Cyclops, who left immediately, but also begged him to stop her before she lost control which he did not hear. After Colossus and Magik began fighting each other and knocked each other out, their portions of the Phoenix went to Scott and Emma. With his vast power, he was able to penetrate the dimensional walls and enter [[K'un-Lun]] where Hope was being hidden.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 9}}

Cyclops made short work of all the Avengers that opposed him and even defeated [[Shou-Lao (Earth-616)|Shou-Lao]] the mythical dragon that granted K'un-Lun its power. Hope managed to copy both the dragons powers as well as the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]'s magic and managed to defeat Cyclops, sending him to the Moon and incapacitating him. The other X-Men defected to the Avengers, recognizing that their implicit trust in Cyclops's leadership had been a mistake. Realizing that he needed more power, Cyclops traveled to Utopia to find Emma. He could not bring himself to attack Emma, however, and they were interrupted by Professor X, who arrived and attempted to shut down their brains. A battle ensued, with the combined might of the Avengers and X-Men uniting to defeat Cyclops and Emma.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 10|11}}

When the battle turned in the Avengers' and X-Men's favor, Cyclops took the final piece of the Phoenix from Emma, making him the sole host of the Phoenix. This proved too much for Cyclops and he lost control, became Dark Phoenix, and killed Xavier. Hope and the Scarlet Witch managed to exorcise the Phoenix Force from him and dissipate it, using it to re-spark mutantkind.{{r|{{cl|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 11}}-[[Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 12|12]]}}

===Consequences===
After losing the Phoenix, Cyclops was placed under arrest and kept in a ruby quartz cube to prevent him from breaking out. While in prison, [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] visited him, taunting him by revealing his survival and goading him into breaking out, telling Cyclops that he was the only one capable of stopping him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 20}} Cyclops was placed in a general population prison and outfitted with a power dampener. In prison, he befriended a new mutant and small-time crook named [[Jake (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Jake]]. Even though Cyclops had decided to stay imprisoned for political reasons, he asked Magneto to break him out after Jake was killed by mutant-haters, realizing that while he remained passive, mutants were dying. Magneto, Danger, and Magik destroyed the prison and freed Cyclops, avenging Jake by having Magik send his killers to [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]] and disfiguring the warden who had facilitated Jake's murder and whose organisation wanted to make profit from mutant misery. After Danger declared she would be walking her own path, the remaining three resolved to continue protecting mutants and save the world that still hates and fears them.{{r|AvX: Consequences Vol 1 1|5}}

===Mutant Revolution===
Together with Magneto and Magik, Cyclops went about liberating unjustly imprisoned mutants and offering them help with their powers and a place on his team. Acting on an old idea, he made the former headquarters of [[Weapon X Facility|Weapon X]] his team's new home. While attempting to liberate Emma Frost, Cyclops and Magneto both began to lose control of their powers. Emma revealed that she had also been going through this and told them that the Phoenix Force had broken their powers. Cyclops vowed to find a way to fix Magneto, Emma, and himself. While attempting to recruit another young mutant, he was confronted by his younger self accompanied by younger versions of the five original [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. The younger version of Jean Grey lost control of her powers, flinging Cyclops away and causing him to lose his visor. The ensuing optic barrage gave the original five the impression that Cyclops was trying to kill them and they attacked him. Magneto stopped them and told Magik to evacuate them.{{r|{{cl|All-New X-Men Vol 1 1}}-[[All-New X-Men Vol 1 4|4]]}}
[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 5 McGuiness Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Scott's uncontrolled beams]]

Cyclops became both conflicted and tormented by his actions towards the original five X-Men, who he knew would see him as a monster, even if it wasn't the truth. Nevertheless, his mission was set and he began to re-train, in secret, to somehow regain control of his abilities. The other part of his mission entailed training his own students in an abandoned Weapon X facility in Western [[Canada]] that he named the "New Charles Xavier's School for the Gifted."{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 3}}

As Cyclops began to rescue more and more mutants, the people on the street began to call him a "revolutionary", holding signs and t-shirts stating "Cyclops was right". He also began to sport a new costume with a giant X emblazoned proudly on his head, indicative of both his mentor and his Mutant Revolution.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 3}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 1}}

During this time, he and Emma reconciled, having had a falling out while possessed by the Phoenix. Both admitted their feelings for each other, but that it would be tough on both of them if they tried to pursue a relationship again. Nevertheless, Scott asked if she would stay for the students, praising her as a great teacher.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 2}}
[[File:X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 1 001.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Cyclops - Mutant Revolutionary]]

Scott would also lead his team back to Australia for [[Eva Bell (Earth-616)|Tempus]] to see her family again, but unbeknownst to him, Magneto had seemingly sold the team out to S.H.I.E.L.D., leading to the Avengers intercepting them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 2}}

Cyclops verbally reprimanded the Avengers, pointing out that despite their attempts to make mutants more integrated into society and making his brother the poster boy for mutant-Avenger co-operation, mutants were still hunted and discriminated against by local law enforcement. They were always "guilty until proven innocent" and the Avengers never stepped in to defend these mutants from such bigotry. His words prompted [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] to aim an arrow towards his skull and forced Captain America to attempt to place him under arrest. Before the fight could breakout however, they were saved by Tempus creating a Time Bubble and trapping the Avengers inside. They returned home to find that Magneto had outed them to S.H.I.E.L.D. as a method to infiltrate their ranks. Scott was livid and ready to blast Erik to pieces, but Emma calmed him down and in fact agreed with Erik's methods. Scott was reluctant at first, but agreed before telling the new students to settle in as the faculty was going on a field trip to the Jean Grey School For Higher Learning.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 3}}

The X-Men present viewed Scott as insane, but listened to what he had to say. Scott explained that they were on the edge of a push back and that while he would defend the Jean Grey School with his dying breath, he felt they were doing little to help against the growing anti-mutant hysteria. He offered people to join his new school, where they would learn to train and prepare to defend themselves for the oncoming battle. Departing briefly, he returned at sunset to collect all interested students and had a disagreement with his past self over methodology. The Stepford Cuckoos and Angel of the time-displaced X-Men joined Scott at his school, despite the protests of Wolverine and the others.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 4}}{{r|All-New X-Men #10}}

===Time Runs Out===
Months later, close to the final [[Glossary:Incursion|Incursion]], Cyclops became the leader of [[Nation X]], a mutant sanctuary protected by [[Sentinels]] programmed to defend mutants. Cyclops offered sanctuary to [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], despite their differences, as he was wanted by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] for being part of the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]]. Cyclops welcomed [[Roberto de le Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] when he came to visit Beast, and also had a little talk with him about the [[Glossary:Incursion|Incursions]], admitting that he was in possession of a Phoenix Egg and was willing to use it.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 38}}

===Secret Wars===
Unfortunately, the Phoenix Egg was not ready to hatch until the final incursion had already began. Cyclops travelled to the incursion point in [[Manhattan]], where the heroes of [[Earth-616]] were fighting the assembled forces of [[Earth-1610]]. The egg finally hatched, and Cyclops once again bonded with the Phoenix Force, now completely in control of its immense power, and used it to destroy the [[Children of Tomorrow (Earth-1610)|Children of Tomorrow]] and the rest of [[Earth-1610]]'s forces. Cyclops was transported onto the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati's]] [[Future Foundation's Life Raft|life raft]] by [[Eden Fesi (Earth-616)|Manifold]], allowing him and the Phoenix to survive the end of the multiverse.{{r|Secret Wars #1}}
[[File:Scott Summers (Earth-616) from Secret Wars Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|250px|thumb|Becoming Phoenix Again]]

Cyclops and the other heroes transported onto the life raft were awakened by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] eight years after the end of the multiverse and the creation of [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]], a planet cobbled together by segments of destroyed realities created and ruled by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]].{{r|Secret Wars #3}}

Cyclops and the other heroes were transported by Strange to confront the [[Cabal (Namor's) (Earth-616)|Cabal]], when Doom himself appeared to quell the fighting. Cyclops, using the vast power of the Phoenix, attempted to defeat Doom. Despite seemingly hurting Doom, even the Phoenix Force proved insufficient to rival the power Doom wielded, and he proceeded to snap Cyclops' neck, killing him.{{r|Secret Wars #4}}

===Death===
Cyclops was resurrected when the Multiverse was restored by [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] and rejoined the X-Men. One day, he and his team of X-Men responded to a distress call from Muir Island. Upon arrival, they discovered all of its staff dead and [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]] in agony. With his dying breath, Madrox informed Scott that the island had been swept by a cloud of [[Terrigen Mist]]s, one of the two unleashed by [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] king [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] many months earlier, which now was proving fatal to mutants.{{r|Death of X Vol 1 1}}
[[File:Scott Summers (Earth-616) and Emma Frost (Earth-616) from Death of X Vol 1 4 002.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Dead in Emma's arms]]

As Cyclops and Emma Frost delved into Muir Island, traces of the mists still present on the island affected Scott, and had a quick [[M-Pox|effect]] on him,{{r|Death of X Vol 1 1}} killing him almost immediately. As he laid suffocating, a dying and confused Cyclops pleaded Emma to not let it end like this.{{r|Death of X Vol 1 4}} Struck by grief, Emma kept Cyclops' death a secret and created a telepathic projection of him. Using Cyclops' guise, and having him act as she believed he would, Emma allowed him one last act of heroism, projecting an image of him facing down the Inhumans after having masterminded a plot that resulted in the transfiguration of one of the Terrigen clouds, rendering it harmless to mutants, humans, and Inhumans. In a final confrontation, "Cyclops" was killed by Black Bolt. He was given a hero's funeral by the X-Men where Storm gave the eulogy honoring Cyclops' life as a teacher, hero, warrior, and mutant, with only Emma and later Havok knowing the truth about Cyclops' death.{{r|{{cl|Death of X Vol 1 1}}-[[Death of X Vol 1 4|4]]}}

===Legacy===
The actions of Emma Frost radically changed the public's perception of Cyclops, with both mutants and humans considering him a terrorist.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 4}} This, along with the new [[M-Pox]] disease, kicked off a new era of worldwide anti-mutant hysteria.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 1}} Scott's time displaced younger self would come to loathe his older self.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 1}}

A group of young mutant extremists idolized Cyclops and named themselves the [[Ghosts of Cyclops (Earth-616)|Ghosts of Cyclops]], wearing masks modelled after his visor and carrying out terrorist acts to misguidedly honor Scott's memory.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 1}}

Mr. Sinister would use Cyclops' DNA to make an [[Scott Summers (Clone) (Earth-616)|Inhuman-Mutant hybrid clone of him]] which fought the X-Men.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 4}} However, the clone became unstable due to its Inhuman side taking over and was defeated by [[James Howlett (Earth-21923)|Old Man Logan]]. When it was shown to start unleashing energy and threaten to explode, Storm and the young Jean Grey used their abilities to move the clone high enough for it to safely explode.{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 5}}

During the [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|war with the Inhumans]], the young Cyclops finally learned the truth about the actions and death of his older self when he was temporarily possessed by the Inhuman [[Morris Sackett (Earth-616)|Mosaic]], and gained access to residual memories Mosaic possessed of his last victim, Magneto, with whom Emma had shared the truth.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 18}} As soon as he could, the young Scott exposed Emma's deception to the other X-Men and the Inhumans leading to Medusa allowing the Terrigen Cloud to be destroyed.{{r|IVX Vol 1 6}} When the time displaced X-Men reunited again, Jean assured young Scott that his older self was not a villain and he would not grow to be one. While this made Scott feel a bit better, it didn't change the fact that he still had to deal with the fact that humans and mutants would still hate him as he still 'wears the face' of his older self.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 19}}

Cyclops was later resurrected by the Phoenix Force as part of its plan to convince Jean Grey, who had also been brought back to life by it, to become its host once more. While Jean took advantage of this reunion to see Scott for one last time, she saw herself forced to kill him, since both acknowledged he shouldn't have been brought back.{{r|Phoenix Resurrection: The Return of Jean Grey Vol 1 5}}

===Dawn of X===
A [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|teenage Cable]], with the help of [[Paul Douek (Earth-616)|Paul Douek]], later brought Scott back from the dead yet again. The resurrection utilized energies siphoned off from the Phoenix Force during Cyclops' previous resurrection, that had been stored within a modified [[Phoenix Cage]] embedded in Scott's corpse during his first funeral.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 5 1}}
[[File:Scott Summers (Earth-616) from Extermination Vol 1 5 0001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Return]]

Shortly afterward, Charles Xavier, Magneto, and Moira MacTaggert established a sovereign mutant nation in Krakoa, and Scott was one of countless mutants who became part of it.{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}} Xavier and Magneto then tasked the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] with destroying the Mother Mold and preventing the creation of Nimrod.{{r|House of X Vol 1 3}} Though they succeed, the entire team was killed in the attack. Cyclops and Jean, the two remaining X-Men, tried to mount an escape, but they tragically failed when [[Alia Gregor (Earth-616)|Dr. Gregor]] killed Scott in revenge for her husband's death.{{r|House of X Vol 1 4}} The team was later resurrected by a group of mutants known as “[[Five (Earth-616)|the Five]]” ([[Eva Bell (Earth-616)|Eva Bell]], [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]], [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]], and [[Fabio Medina (Earth-616)|Goldballs]]). Merging their powers, the Five were able to transfer the deceased X-Men’s minds into cloned bodies. They were later proclaimed as the heroes of Krakoa.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}

Later, Scott moved into the [[Summer House]], located within the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] alongside members of his family including Jean, Vulcan, Havok, Wolverine, Prestige, and Cable.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 1}} Although the Quiet Council disbanded the X-Men, no longer seeing them as necessary now that mutants had their own nation. When Krakoa and [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]] [[X of Swords|fought,]] Cyclops and Marvel Girl reformed the team when they went to Otherworld to rescue their son and the remaining mutants in that dimension.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 15}} After this Cyclops and Jean decided to keep the team going as opposed to taking positions on The Quiet Council because they felt the mutants of Krakoa needed someone working in their best interests. Letting the people chose the team lineup themselves through an election.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 16}}

This election was held at at the [[Hellfire Gala]] with all the worlds mutant's either voting or nominating themselves telepathically. [[Everett Thomas (Earth-616)|Synch]], Wolverine (Kinney), Sunfire, Rogue and Polaris were elected as the new team.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 21}} Cyclops created a new base for this team in a lot of land Emma had purchased for them in Central Park and 86th Street, turning it into a park that was a celebration of mutant accomplishment and a memorial for mutants such as Thunderbird, who couldn’t be revived. In this park, he had Krakoa and Forge create a techno-organic [[Treehouse]] for the team to operate in and, unlike the other Krakoan gates and embassies, this area was free to visit by humans and mutants.{{r|X-Men Vol 6 1}}

After forming, this team fought off two alien attacks: one by the [[Mind Reaver (Earth-616)|Mind Reaver]] in Manhattan, the other by the Annihilation Wave in Kansas. This was the work of the intergalactic crime lord [[Cordyceps Jones (Earth-616)|Cordyceps Jones]] who had been running bets on who could destroy the Earth first on his casino [[Gameworld]].{{r|X-Men Vol 6 1|2}} Since he was now splitting time between leading the X-Men and being a captain of Krakoa, he stepped down as Captain Commander giving the role to [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] instead.{{r|Inferno Vol 2 1}}

| Personality             = Scott is brave, selfless, a master tactician, and first-rate leader. He has very low self-esteem, however, holding a low opinion of himself and obsessing over his shortcomings and failures. Socially, he has described himself as an introvert. As a leader, he is very strict and no-nonsense, demanding seriousness, dedication, and skill, usually earning him the dislike of more rebellious team members such as [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].

Scott also has a plethora of mental issues, bottling up his emotions and refusing to confront his issues, despite this affecting him adversely. Being possessed by [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] profoundly affected Scott, stirring up many emotions he had repressed and making him question his life and his marriage. 

After beginning his relationship with [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], Scott's personality softened somewhat and his confidence and self-esteem improved, despite having to face more hardships than ever. This is generally attributed to counselling he received from Frost, and his happiness with their relationship. 

===Romantic Relationships===
Although he is seen as lonely, Cyclops has had many serious relationships. A striking feature is the fact that he seems irresistible to women with telepathic abilities. He was married to Jean Grey and her clone Madelyne Pryor, who are both Omega-class telepaths, and was also in a long-time serious relationship with Emma Frost, who is an Omega-class telepath as well. Psylocke, another telepath, once tried to seduce him.

Cyclops also dated non-mutant women. During a time when he thought Jean was dead he had an affair with Colleen Wing. After Phoenix was killed on the moon, he dated Lee Forrester for a while before finding Madelyne Pryor. Recently, his student and teammate Eva Bell (Tempus) has demonstrated interest in Cyclops, though Cyclops does not reciprocate these feelings.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 5}}

| Powers                  = Cyclops is an '''[[Mutant Power Level Classification|Alpha-Mutant]]''' according to [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]],{{r|X-Men Vol 2 97}} while [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]'s intelligence classified him as power level 7.{{r|Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury #1}}

'''Optic Blast:''' Cyclops possesses the mutant ability to project a powerful beam of concussive, ruby-colored force from his eyes. Cyclops' powers come from ambient energies (such as solar radiation, photons, and cosmic rays) absorbed and metabolized by his body into concussive blasts that are released from his eyes. 

Cyclops' mind has a particular psionic field that is attuned to the forces that maintain the apertures that have taken the place of his eyes. Because his mind's psionic field envelops his body, it automatically shunts the other-dimensional particles back into their point of origin when they collide with his body. Thus, his body is protected from the effects of the particles, and even the thin membrane of his eyelids is sufficient to block the emission of energy. The synthetic ruby quartz crystal used to fashion the lenses of Cyclops' eyeglasses and visor is resonant to his minds' psionic field and is similarly protected.

The width of Cyclops' eye-blasts seems to be focused by his mind's psionic field with the same autonomic function that regulated his original eyes' ability to focus. As Cyclops focuses, the size of the aperture changes and thus act as a valve to control the flow of particles and beam's relative power. The height of Cyclops' eye-blast is controlled by his visor's adjustable slit. His narrowest beam, about the diameter of a pencil at a distance of 4 feet has a force of about two pounds per square inch. His broadest beam, about 90 feet across at a distance of fifty feet, has a force of about 10 pounds per square inch. His most powerful eye-blast is a beam four feet across which, at a distance of 50 feet, has a force of 500 pounds per square inch. The maximum angular measurement of Cyclops' eye-blast is equivalent to a wide-angle 35 millimeter camera lens field of view (90 degrees measured diagonally, or the angle subtended by holding a magazine's pages spread open, upright at 9.5 inches from your eyes). The minimum angular measurement is equivalent to the angle that the thickness of a pencil would subtend at 4 feet (3.5 degrees, about a quarter of an inch viewed at 4 feet). The beam's effective range is about 2,000 feet, at which point a 1-inch beam has spread out to 10 feet square, and then has a pressure of .38 pounds per square inch. Cyclops' maximum force is sufficient to tip over a filled 5,000 gallon tank at a distance of 20 feet, or puncture a 1-inch carbon-steel plate at a distance of 2 feet. 

The extra dimensional supply of energy for Cyclops' eye-blast is practically infinite. Thus, so long as Cyclops' psionic field is active (which is constant), there is the potential to emit energy. The only limit to the eye-blast is the mental fatigue of focusing constantly. After about 15 minute of constant usage, the psionic field subsides and allows only a slight leakage of energy to pass through the aperture. Cyclops' metabolism will recover sufficiently for him to continue in about an additional 15 minutes.

The maximum force of Cyclops' optic blasts are unknown, but a commonly given description is that he can "punch holes through mountains", and he has been shown to rupture a half-inch thick carbon steel plate. During a particular battle, Scott says that he hit [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Cain Marko]] (a.k.a. the Juggernaut) with enough power to split a small planet in half, though he may have been indulging in hyperbole. In the [[Earth-295|Age of Apocalypse]] dimension, his beams can cut through [[Adamantium]], a previously indestructible metal. In the mainstream continuity of the [[Earth-616|Marvel Universe]], it has also been implied that Cyclops only utilizes a fraction of the energies at his disposal. During the ''Civil War: X-Men'' story arc, Cyclops is controlled by another mutant to use his powers at their full magnitude. When directed at the energy-absorbing mutant [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]], Cyclops was able to overload Bishop's powers in a matter of seconds. When [[Iron Man (Anthony "Tony" Stark)|Iron Man]] measured Cyclops' power while he was powering Bishop, he found the energy output was well over 2 gigawatts,{{r|Civil War: X-Men Vol 1 4}} larger than a large nuclear reactor. It is also stated that Cyclops does not use his powers at such a level due to the preoccupation he has regarding his control (or lack thereof) of his abilities.

Cyclops once fought [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|The Hulk]], using a beam blast to stop him, refusing to let the Hulk take [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Xavier]]. While it peels off some of the Hulk's skin, he was able to walk towards Cyclops and clench his entire face, effectively containing the blast.{{r|{{cl|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 1}}-[[World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 2|2]]}}

'''Trajectory Bending:''' When his younger self came to the future, this iteration of Cyclops displayed more directive control over his optic beams than his elder counterpart. Cyclops potentially has the capacity to will his optic blasts to twist and curve in any given direction without need of a solid surface to bounce his eye beams off of.{{r|Cyclops Vol 3 11}}

'''Spatial Awareness:''' Cyclops possesses an uncanny sense of trigonometry, in this sense used to describe his observation of objects around himself and the angles found between surfaces of these objects. Cyclops has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to cause his optic blasts to ricochet and/or reflect off those objects in a trajectory to his liking. This is commonly called a "banked shot" when applied to this talent. Cyclops has been observed causing beams to reflect from over a dozen surfaces in the course of one blast, and still hit his intended target accurately. It is his sense of spatial awareness enhanced to superhuman levels that allows him to perform these feats as well.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 199}}

'''Energy Resistance:''' Cyclops is resistant to the effects of his own powers. This is linked to him being capable of withstanding his brother's ability with no ill effects, a result of their close genetics and a quirk of mutant genetics that is common among siblings.

'''[[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]]:''' Cyclops was one of five avatars of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] which granted him the great powers of the Phoenix. So far Cyclops has only displayed interstellar travel but as an avatar he should presumably possess the following abilities as well:
* '''Interstellar Travel:''' A Phoenix Force avatar can fly unaided through the vacuum of space, and can travel interstellar distances faster than the speed of light.
* '''Cosmic Pyrokinetics:''' An Avatar of the Phoenix can create 'cosmic' flames under any conditions even the impossible ones such as vacuum space or underwater. These flames do not require oxygen to burn, and burn so intensely that matter is consumed without by-products such as ash. It has perfect control over these flames, and they only consume what it wills. Typically they manifest as a raptor or part of a raptor such as a claw or wings, in the case of an avatar.
* '''Resurrection:''' As the embodiment of all life and death itself, the Phoenix Force can resurrect whomever it desires into pure living flesh, bone, and blood. 
* '''Immortality:''' The Avatar of the Phoenix does not age and can be resurrected by the Phoenix Force.
* '''Temporal Manipulation:''' An Avatar acting as the Phoenix Force can manipulate the past across large temporal distances and with a profound knowledge of the causal effect his or her actions will have.
* '''Telepathy:''' A Phoenix Force Avatar can project their thoughts into the minds of others and read other peoples thoughts at a near boundless level.
* '''Telekinesis:''' An Avatar of the Phoenix can control and manipulate matter at a molecular scale.

'''Controlled Optic Blasts:''' After genetic tampering by an alien entity, Scott Summers initially lost his powers only to regain them but at a stronger level with total control over them. How far his control extent was is currently unknown; all that was seen was that he could open his eyes without involuntary discharge, control its blast radius or force output, and fire it for prolonged intervals without tiring out.{{r|X-Men First Class Vol 2 6|7}} Another time he gained was during a later plot by Loki to trick the mortal superhuman adventurers into accepting a paradise of his  design.{{r|{{cl|X-Men/Alpha Flight Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Men/Alpha Flight Vol 1 2|2]]}} The third time control over his power was within his reach was through psychic meddling from Emma Frost,{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 14}} which temporarily left him in a coma before he was revived, his power in check at last.{{r|{{cl|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 23}}-[[Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 24|24]]}}

'''Gamma Transformation:''' During the World War Hulks event, Scott/Cyclops had been exposed to the [[Cathexis Ray Generator]] which caused him to bulk up into a gamma mutate like numerous other heroes.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 21|22}} Gaining incredulous amounts of bodily mass at the expense of higher brain function.{{r|Hulked-Out Heroes Vol 1 2}} His physiology had been radically altered beyond the addition of excess bone, skin and musculature density to his anatomical frame as he now boasted a head and scalp teaming with numerous eyes through which he could discharge multitudinous optic beams from; on top of having a near perfect 360° field of vision to see out of.{{r|World War Hulks: Spider-Man vs Thor Vol 1 1}}
*'''Superhuman Strength'''
*'''Superhuman Durability'''
*'''Superhuman Stamina'''
*'''Regenerative Healing Factor'''
*'''Multiple Eyes''': In the brief time Scott had been hulked out, not only did he have perfect control over his optic blasts. Hulkclops boasted a xerox of ocular organs across his cranial area.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 22}} This enabled him to fire a plethora of optic beams in various directions as well as concentrate their fire in any given direction. Making his energy rays much more powerful than they normally are by they're lonesome.{{r|World War Hulks: Spider-Man vs Thor Vol 1 2}}
**'''Scatter Shot'''
**'''Focused Blast'''

'''Black Vortex Empowerment:''' After exposure to the power of the [[Black Vortex]] Scott's cosmic potential was unleashed, vastly improving on all of his previous abilities and bestowing additional ones.
*'''Self-Sustenance:''' can survive in the vacuum of space unaided.
*'''Flight:''' able to fly at various speeds unaided.
*'''Controlled Optic Blasts:''' Cyclops could freely project and halt his optic energy blasts at will without need of a ruby quartz visor.
**'''Enhanced Blast Power:''' Scott's optic energy beams were significantly stronger in his empowered state, able to penetrate an ice wall and topple a small army of knife's thugs.

'''[[Character Index/Unnamed Symbiotes#Cyclops' Symbiote|Symbiote]]:''' While out in space searching for his father, Scott and the rest of his teammates were bonded to Klyntar symbiotes,{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 21}} which adapted to their unique powers. Scott's symbiote became able to form ruby-quartz "eyes" anywhere on its body and fire concussive energy beams from them.{{r|Venom Vol 1 162}} He could also manifest energized constructs channeling his optic energies, like tendrils or focus crystals.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 22}}

| Abilities               = '''Expert Pilot:''' Cyclops is an expert pilot of fixed-wing aircraft, a skill he shares with his [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|father]]. It has also been implied that his trigonometric sense improves his abilities in the air. 

'''Master Tactician and Strategist:''' Cyclops has spent most of his superhero career as the leader of either the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] or [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]{{citation}} and has developed exceptional leadership skills. Regardless of their general attitude towards him X-Men tend to obey his orders in battle, because they know that he is usually right.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 11}}

'''Multilingual:''' In addition to English, Cyclops is fluent in both Mandarin Chinese and Russian. The former was telepathically taught to him by Emma Frost,{{r|New X-Men Annual Vol 1 2001}} while the latter was telepathically taught to him by Professor X.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #153}}

'''Expert Martial Artist:''' Cyclops also has extensive training in martial arts and unarmed combat, holding black belts in judo and aikido. His level of skill is sufficient to defeat six normal men with his eyes closed, and he has in the past held his own against dangerous hand-to-hand enemies such as [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]].

'''Telepathic Resistance:''' Years of being in intimate situations with telepaths have allowed Cyclops to hone his mind to the point where he can resist telepathic intrusion and withhold certain information from high level telepaths.
| Strength                = Cyclops possesses the strength of a normal human male who engages in intensive regular exercise and hence is able to press lift at least his own body-weight. 

| Weaknesses              = '''Genetic Flaw:''' Cyclops is not immune to [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]]'s powers like he is to [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]]'s. 

'''Power Regulation Disability:''' Due to psychological trauma and physical injury at a young age, Cyclops is unable to control his optic blasts. In connection, his eyes have become more reliant on the ruby quartz he uses rather than affecting change to the injury. [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] has claimed the psychological trauma of losing his parents and being separated from his brother are primarily responsible for his inability to control his powers. [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] has also claimed that his eyes have become reliant on the [[Ruby-Quartz|ruby quartz]] sunglasses and [[Cyclops' Visor|visor]], therefore making it hard for Cyclops to control the blasts on his own. After overcoming the trauma, he was able to control his blasts and open his eyes for a period of time. However, he gradually began losing control of the blasts and had to revert back to using the sunglasses and visor. His inability to control his power only worsened when exposure to the Phoenix Force altered them to an even more unstable and powerful state.{{r|All-New X-Men #3}} Due to this, his blasts are now flawed and can be either stronger than before or turn off in the middle of a battle.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 22}} 

'''Surplus Energy:''' Cyclops has mentioned that he needs to fire blasts frequently, because he gathers surplus energy within him if not. He apparently needs an outlet for that energy.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 3}}

'''Recharge Intervals:''' Scott once required time between his optic blasts to recharge.{{r|X-Men #14}} Now due to possession by the Phoenix Force coupled with internal tampering from Nanotech Sentinels the flaw has become more assertive than ever before, his optic blasts erupting powerfully one minute and then falling dead depleted the next, physically exhausting him in the process.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 6}}

As an after-effect of exposure to the crippling energies of the Phoenix Force, his powers seemed to have altered beyond their original state of being. His optic blasts, although more powerful than ever, were now vastly uncontrollable.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 6}} A side effect of his damaged abilities caused his concussion beams to bend, weave, and arc in alternate directions, giving his blasts the appearance of multiple curving blasts spiraling around the core blasts and making his new optic blasts even harder to dodge.{{r|All-New X-Men #4}}

'''Handicap:''' Cyclops' right eye was destroyed when [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]] shot him in the face.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 15}} Although half-blind, Scott's power seemed to be mostly unaffected.{{r|Champions Vol 3 5}}

| Equipment               = 
[[File:Cyclops' Visor from Extermination Vol 1 5 cover.jpg|thumb|Cyclops' visor]]
'''[[Cyclops' Visor]]:''' The mask Scott wears to prevent random discharge is lined with powdered ruby quartz crystal. It incorporates two longitudinally mounted flat lenses which can lever inward providing a constantly variable exit slot of 0 inches to .79 inches in height and a constant width of 5.7 inches. The inverted clam-shell mechanism is operated by a twin system of miniature electrical motors. As a safety factor their is a constant positive closing pressure provided by springs. The mask itself is made of high-impact plastic. There is an overriding finger-operated control mechanism on either side of the mask, and normal operation is through a flat micro-switch installed in the thumb of either glove.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 #43}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #3}}
* A separate pair of lenses were also designed for Scott to use while sleeping.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #337}}
* He also used "emergency ruby quartz contacts".{{r|New X-Men #114}}

'''[[X-Uniform|Cyclops' X-Suit]]:''' The current costume of Cyclops is a variation of the basic costume designed by Charles Xavier, the Professor X, to their first and original X-Men. The costume (X-Costume, X-Suit, or X-Uniform) was designed for body protection and ideological identification with the public, marking him as a superhero. Cyclops wears a suit made of Kevlar, which is fire retardant among others defensive properties. The uniform also offers a certain level of resistance to electric shocks, force impacts, and others basic types of attacks.{{r|New X-Men #114}}

'''Arkon's Boltz''': Scott once made use of Arkon the Imperion's lightning bolts as a means of transporting himself and the X team to the Nine realms of Asgard in order to confront Loki and get their young wards, the New Mutants back from the mythic lands.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 9}}

| Weapons                 = '''"Erik the Red" Gloves:''' When Scott used the disguise of Erik the Red, he was able to project his optic blasts through its gloves.{{Citation}}

'''[[Muramasa Blade]]:''' Cyclops was given the Muramasa Blade, an enchanted sword with a piece of Wolverine's soul with the ability to negate superhuman healing factors. Cyclops received the sword from Wolverine, who told him that the sword was the only thing that could permanently put him down should it ever be needed. Cyclops wielded the Muramasa Blade once against Wolverine's son [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]], after he and the X-Men decided to kill him. Daken turned out to have been setting them up however, and stole the sword from Cyclops.{{Citation}}

| Notes                   = 
[[File:Scott Summers (Earth-616) from X-Men Annual Vol 1 14 0001.png|thumb|right|As a hound]]
* Following a childhood head trauma, Cyclops is unable to shut off his optic blasts at will and must therefore wear a visor, glasses, or contacts with ruby quartz lenses that block the beams.
* Emma Frost once indicated the psychological trauma of losing his parents and being separated from his brother are primarily responsible for his inability to control his powers.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 14}}
* Scott frequently listens to the radio, and even worked as a DJ for some time.{{r|X-Men #48}}
* At first, the only people who knew about Emma Frost's deception surrounding Cyclops' death were Cyclops' brother [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]],{{r|Death of X Vol 1 4}} Magneto,{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 18}}{{r|IVX Vol 1 4}} the Inhuman [[Morris Sackett (Earth-616)|Mosaic]],{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 18}}{{r|IVX Vol 1 4}} and Cyclops' time-displaced younger self.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 18}} The latter was so angry over this revelation that he lashed out at Emma Frost the moment the next time he encountered her.{{r|IVX Vol 1 5}} Young Cyclops later revealed Emma's deception to the rest of the X-Men and Inhumans.{{r|IVX Vol 1 6}}
* It was erroneously stated in the first print of the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' that Cyclops' eyes contain inter-dimensional apertures, releasing powerful energies from another dimension into his own via the beams. Later accounts state that Scott's body naturally metabolizes ambient energy that is used to open and focus the apertures in his eyes. The energy of the beam itself originates from this other dimension. This explanation, however, was later changed for subsequent prints.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-legends-revealed-438/3/|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #438|last=Cronin|first=Brian|work=CBR|date=27 September 2013|accessdate=17 June 2014}}}}
*[[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] disliked Cyclops' inability to socialize with his fellow X-Men. In his view, Cyclops was a grouch who thought that smiling or having fun was sinful. {{r|X-Men Vol 1 5}}
*Cyclops rarely smiled during his early years with the X-Men. When seeing Cyclops smile, [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] noted to himself that this was the first time he had seen Cyclops smile in months. {{r|X-Men Vol 1 6}}
*During a search for Magneto's base, the [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] was almost killed in a fall from a height. Cyclops expressed more concern over an expensive camera which the Beast was holding than Beast's safety. The Beast took note of Cyclops' lack of concern for him.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 6}}
*Scott has exhibited many symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD),{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 1}} stating that for hobbies and passtimes he has to avoid "anything that involves problem solving, strategy, or obsessive repetition of a practiced skill", and once playing horseshoes for 27 hours straight until Iceman came out and pulled all of the stakes out of the ground.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 14}}

| Trivia                  = 
* Scott was very close to his mother in law [[Elaine Grey (Earth-616)|Elaine Grey]] who acted as a motherly figure toward him. The two continued to be close even after the death of his wife [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]]. Scott was severely upset when Elaine was slain by [[Black Cloak (Earth-616)|Black Cloak]], a victim of the extermination of the Grey Genome.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #468}}
* Scott enjoyed watching {{WP|Seinfeld}}.{{r|Champions Vol 2 9}}
* Each of the Summer Brothers has a signature energy color: Scott has red, Alex has blue, and Gabriel had yellow.
