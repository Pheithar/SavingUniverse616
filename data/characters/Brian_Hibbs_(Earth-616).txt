===Early Life===
The interior decorator Brian Hibbs had a long time desire to become a super-villain, and he was principally inspired by [[Frank Oliver (Earth-616)|Frank Oliver]]. After Oliver's death, Hibbs spent many years learning skills similar to his. He then worked for a criminal corporation in Mississippi as the new Kangaroo but was defeated by [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]].{{r|Cage #13}}

His first encounter with [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] resulted in a easy defeat. After escaping from police custody, Hibbs searched for a rematch with Spider-Man, and lost again.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #242}} He was freed from prison by [[Maxwell Markham (Earth-616)|Grizzly]] along other less-respected Spider-Man's foes like [[Johnathon Ohnn (Earth-616)|Spot]] and [[Martin Blank (Earth-616)|Gibbon]] to form the [[Spider-Man Revenge Squad (Earth-616)|Spider-Man Revenge Squad]].{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #244}} Although they could defeated Spider-Man, his internal problems led to every one fighting each other, Kangaroo was sent to prison, where he started building up his fighting skills and strength, which he hoped might later give pause to his opponents.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #245|246}}

Kangaroo then found himself incarcerated in [[Seagate Prison]] where superhuman powers are dampened. Once again following his idol's path, Hibbs trained to become a master combatant. He gained a name for himself as a  fighter, alongside [[Batroc the Leaper]], another supervillain gifted with powerful legs.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #164}}

After going to failed treatments seeking for superhuman mutations, Hibbs tried to have a normal life as a professional baseball player under the name of Billy Bob Jenks, but his super-star status was pulled down when his criminal past was revealed,{{r|Nova Vol 3 7}} returning to his life of crime. At prison, the stress and exertion made his mutation attempts effective, increasing his size and strength.

Kangaroo was captured by [[Alexei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Alyosha Kraven]] and imprisoned in his menagerie of animal-themed heroes and villains. He was seemingly killed when Kraven's devolved the captives to their bestial state and set all of them free.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 #14}}

===Ends of the Earth===
After gaining freedom, Hibbs started a superheroic career in [[Australia]]. There, he was among the global group of heroes to answer Spider-Man's call to destroy [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]]'s facilities in order to thwart Octavius's scheme to use his technology to raise the Earth's temperature by artificially accelerating the greenhouse effect. When Hibbs entered one facility in Australia, he was ambushed by [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]] and was seemingly killed.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth #1}}

Hibbs survived, and apparently returned to his villainous (or at least mercenary) ways.{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man #12}} He was later recruited by [[Leland Owlsley (Earth-616)|the Owl]] to aid in [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]]'s raid on [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|the Chameleon's]] base of operations.{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man #15}}
