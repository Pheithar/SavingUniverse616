===Origin===
Paras Gavaskar was raised as one of two sons of a wealthy family living in [[Panchajana]] outside of [[Mumbai]], [[India]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 238}} The Gavaskars were Jainites and raised Paras in the Jain Dharma tradition teaching him to avoid doing harm to any living being.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Annual Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Alpha Squadron (Earth-616) from New X-Men Academy X Yearbook Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Indra and the [[Alpha Squadron (Earth-616)|Alpha Squadron]]]]
===Academy X===
After his [[Homo superior|mutant]] powers manifested, Paras enrolled as a student at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] and moved to the [[United States of America|United States]]. Taking on the codename '''[[Indra]]''', he was placed in the [[Alpha Squadron (Earth-616)|Alpha Squadron]] under the mentorship of [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 13|14}}{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook Vol 1 1}}

Alpha Squadron suffered a great loss when Northstar had been killed by the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]]. [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]] was assigned as the new adviser Alpha Squadron.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 13|14}}

===M-Day===
Indra was one of the few students to remain his powers after [[Decimation|M-Day]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 20}} Despite his stance on non-violence, Indra participated in [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]'s sparing exercise to determine the roster for the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 23}}

Indra was among the students captured by [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]] and held in [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 38}} When [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] orchestrated an escape attempt, Indra was beaten badly by [[S'ym (Earth-616)|S'ym]] as punishment.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 39}}

When the students were returned to the Institute, [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]] became interested in determining who was the youngest mutant at the school. Unfortunately, Indra was identified with this dubious honor.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}} Believing that being the youngest mutant meant he was a target, most of the other students, with the exception of [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]], began to avoid Indra.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 43}}

[[File:Paras Gavaskar (Earth-616) from X-Men Legacy Vol 1 234 001.jpg|thumb|left|Indra unable to use his powers]]
===X-Men===
Indra relocated to [[San Francisco]] when the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] reformed and relocated there.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 500}}{{r|X-Men: Manifest Destiny Vol 1 1|5}} During [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] and [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]]'s attack on X-Men, Indra was assaulted by a H.A.M.M.E.R. agent and attacked him in self-defense.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 226}} Because of his deeply held belief in nonviolence, this incident led to an internal crisis and the loss of his powers.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Annual Vol 1 1}} On [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] began counselling Indra. While working through his conflict, Indra made a breakthrough and suddenly transformed, creating psionic armor and weapons vastly different from his original form.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 234}}

Indra was called home by his parents after [[Tejpal Gavaskar (Earth-616)|his brother]] fell into a coma. Along with Rogue, [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], [[Alani Ryan (Earth-616)|Loa]], and [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]], Indra travelled to [[Mumbai]]. Unbeknownst to Indra, [[Rav Gavaskar (Earth-616)|his father]] planned to have him married off in the place of his brother. Indra begrudgingly agreed to marry and leave the X-Men.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 238}}

[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) from X-Men Legacy Vol 1 241 001.jpg|thumb|left|Indra fighting alongside the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] in [[Mumbai]]]]
While in India, the [[Children of the Vault (Earth-616)|Children of the Vault]] arrived pursuing their wayward member, [[Luz (Earth-616)|Luz]], who had recently been brought back to the Gavaskars' estate. When the Children of the Vault arrived, they kidnapped Rogue, Magneto, and [[Vaipala Rani (Earth-616)|Vaipala]], Paras' new fiancée.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 239}} With the Children of the Vault crashing the [[Corridor]] into Mumbai, the remaining X-Men and Luz were left to rescue everyone.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 240|241}}

Following the battle, Indra decided that the path of non-violence was not the way to stop the evil in the world. Rejecting the wishes of his family, Indra decided to return to the U.S. and the X-Men.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 241}}

Following the [[Schism (Event)|schism]] between [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], Indra relocated with Wolverine and the other to the new [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]] in [[Westchester County]], [[New York (State)|New York]].{{r|X-Men: Regenesis Vol 1 1}}

He relocated to [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] alongside many other mutants. There, he was reunited with old friends thanks to the resurrection protocols.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 5}}

Indra is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] with powers including:
* '''''Retractable Exoskeleton:''''' Indra possesses a physically retractable exoskeleton.{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy Annual Vol 1 1}} The mechanic behind his power is unknown, but he is able to summon his exoskeleton almost instantaneously and with little to no restriction in his mobility.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 43}} His exoskeleton originally formerly took the form of a rhinoceros beetle-like armor.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 23}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 43}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy Annual Vol 1 1}}
** '''''Superhuman Durability:''''' With his armor, Indra possesses increased durability. In his armored form, he is immune to conventional trauma and also has limited resistance to energy attacks.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 43}}
* '''''Psionic Armor and Weapons:''''' Since he used his powers in violent self-defense and temporarily lost the use of his powers,{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 226}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy Annual Vol 1 1}} Indra began to manifest psionic, ornate, Hindu-stylized armor and levitating weapons such as swords, knives, and axes.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 234}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 240|241}}

* In the {{cl|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook Vol 1 1}}, Indra was voted Most Reliable. He also listed his going home to visit my family and science class, and his dislikes meat (because he's a vegetarian).{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook Vol 1 1}}
* Indra had a sister who also reportedly attended the Xavier Institute, but she never was introduced and was likely depowered and possibly killed.{{Citation}}

| Trivia                  = * The codename '''[[Indra]]''' is derived from [[Indra (Deity) (Earth-616)|the Hindu god of war and weather, the armorer of heaven]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 234}}
** [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] theorized that Paras chose "Indra" as his codename because he was labelling a part of himself or the potential inside of himself.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 234}}
* Indra is a vegetarian.{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook Vol 1 1}}
