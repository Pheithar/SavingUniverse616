| History                 = '''Albert DeVoor''' first appeared as a business representative for Interlocking Technologies, buying the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] from [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] when they were running low on money. However, this was merely a part of a larger scheme by [[Arkon (Earth-616)|Arkon]] which involved pitting the armies of three worlds ([[Earth-616]], [[Earth-721|Earth-A]] and the [[Earth-6212|Fifth Dimension]]) against each other.{{r|Fantastic Four #160|163}}

DeVoor later created a business model with his Earth-A counterpart for exotic tourism. People from his counterpart's reality would pay to visit the "World of Marvels" of Earth-616, since super-beings were virtually unheard of where they came from. Some lucky tourists also received super-powers upon traveling to Earth-616, if their 616 counterparts had powers to begin with. This led to a series of mishaps involving Earth-A doppelgangers acting out of character in Earth-616.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 2 #21}}
