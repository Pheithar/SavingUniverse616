===Origin and early years===
'''Marshall Evan Stone III''' was born in [[Albany]], [[New York]].

When his mutant nature manifested, Marshall sought aid in controlling his body's now-protoplasmic state. Help came in the form of the [[Henry McCoy (Earth-295)|Dark Beast]], who gave Stone control in exchange for his services as a superhuman operative for [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]. Though still only a young boy, Stone used his powers to make himself appear larger and older, becoming the bounty hunter '''Random'''.

As a bounty hunter, he took down a mutant suspect, a serial killer, and [[James Sanders (Earth-616)|Speed Demon]], but didn't kill any of them.

He established himself in [[Albany]] with a housekeeper and mother-figure [[Vera (Random) (Earth-616)|Vera]].{{r|Marvel Legacy: The 1990s Handbook #1}}

At some point a thief, he killed [[Charles Ronalds (Earth-616)|Charlie Ronalds]]'s parents [[Harry Ronalds (Earth-616)|Harry]] and [[Robin Ronalds (Earth-616)|Robin]] while the family was leaving a screening of the [[Wikipedia:Batman (1966 film)|1966 Batman movie]]. Charlie Ronalds grew up with a hatred for mutants.{{r|X-Factor Annual #8}}

===[[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]===
He developed a crush on [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] and confided in her his real name.

Stone often worked with the government-sponsored team [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] until the Dark Beast had him betray them by capturing their leader, Havok. Stone later aided [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] against the Dark Beast, freeing himself from servitude.

He also later freed [[Maria Callasantos (Earth-616)|Feral]] too, and helped the [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]] fight [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]].{{r|Quicksilver #9}} 

He briefly joined [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]'s mutant army in [[Genosha]], forming a pair with the [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]], and both were taken down by [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Scott Summers]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 112}}

===[[Neverland]] and [[Weapon X]]===
He was then somehow captured by the [[Weapon X]] program and incarcerated in the "[[Neverland]]" concentration camp. On the first day, when guards began separating the mutants, he and [[Lillian Crawley (Earth-616)|Diamond Lil]] tried to resist, but were beat up by the [[Boxbots]] guards, while their powers were negated by a dampening field erected by an enslaved [[Leech (Earth-616)|Leech]].{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 5}}

When the majority of Neverland's residents were massacred by the mesmerized Agent Zero, Random was one of the survivors considered still useful by the Weapon X Program.{{r|Weapon X: Days of Future Now #3}}

[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) from X-Men Legacy Vol 1 243 001.jpg|right|thumb|320px|Random & the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] vs. [[Karima Shapandar (Earth-616)|Omega Sentinel]]]]
===[[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolyte]]===
After M-Day, Random joined [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus's]] reformed Acolytes,{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 3 1}} and later the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] during [[Messiah Complex]]. When [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Xavier]] convinced Exodus to disband the Acolytes, Random relocated to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy #225}}

===Utopia===
He relocated to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], and joined the fight against [[Nimrod (Earth-10076)|Nimrod Sentinels]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 #14}} After that, Random helped with the cleanup,{{r|X-Men: Legacy #242}} and coincidentally helped fight [[Karima Shapandar (Earth-616)|Omega Sentinel]] when she went haywire.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #243}}

Some time following the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|conflict between the Avengers against the X-Men]], after which [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] was abandoned, Random formed part of the [[Utopians (Earth-616)|Utopians]], a group of mutants that started inhabiting the island.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 40}}

The [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] were sought out by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to investigate the island after a recon team went missing. The X-Men teleported to the island, and initially engaged the Utopians. After talking it out and discovering the Utopians wanted nothing but to be safe and undisturbed, the X-Men offered them a place at the [[Weapon X Facility|New Charles Xavier School]], which they gladly accepted.{{r|All-New X-Men #41}}

===House of X===
Random was eventually welcomed to the new mutant island of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], created by Xavier, Magneto, and [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira X]]. He entered through the teleportation gateway alongside other villainous and fractious mutants, who had been invited to join the nation in order to heal mutantdom and start over as a whole species together.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}

| Powers                 = '''Random Mutant-Power Adaptation:''' Random is a mutant with the ability to automatically counter other mutant powers randomly. He is able to generate a defense against rust and magnetism, can produce a high-pitched whistle against Wolfsbane, generated a counter-wind against Pirouette, deployed a counter-magnetic force against Polaris, and proved resistant against Havok's plasma energy.

'''Malleable Protoplasm Body:''' His entire body is composed of a malleable protoplasmic substance, which, with the aid of Dark Beast, stabilized in the form of a human teenager. He can assume a gelatinous state through which holes can be cast by narrow or collapse into a shapeless mass.
* '''Enhanced Strength & Durability:''' With effort, he can increase his mass and bulk into his 'bounty-hunter state', increasing his size and strength to a certain limit, giving him a degree of super-strength and invulnerability.
* '''Protoplasmic Projectiles:''' Random can transform his forearms into guns that fire hardened protoplasm that appears to be extracted from his own cells/biomatter.
* '''Healing Factor:''' His body can rapidly regenerate damaged or detached/severed biomatter and limbs.

She was apparently nothing more than a construct formed from his own protoplasm.{{r|X-Factor #112}}
