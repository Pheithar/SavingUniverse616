| History                 = Malpractice was a member of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s [[Department of Occult Armaments (Earth-616)|D.O.A.]] - Department of Occult Armaments - alongside [[Gregory Belial (Earth-616)|Lt. Belial]], [[Rupert Helona (Earth-616)|Innards]], [[Alizon Baunacha (Earth-616)|Pyre]], and [[Ayla Ranefer (Earth-616)|Rotwrap]]. D.O.A. came into conflict with the [[Nightstalkers (Earth-616)|Nightstalkers]] when they targeted [[Hannibal King (Earth-616)|Hannibal King]] to be a specimen for Hydra when they planned to develop vampiric troopers.

===Fear Itself - The Fearless===
Malpractice and the rest of D.O.A. reappeared to do a simple recon mission for [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Sin]] as she attempted to retrieve the mystical hammers when they were scattered throughout the world after the [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]] and the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]] were defeated. The DOA managed to place a spider-shaped tracking device on [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] as she attempted to retrieve the mystic hammers before they could fall into the wrong hands.

After Sin took control of the D.O.A, Innards was part of a team that attacked Valkyrie, lead by [[Brock Rumlow (Earth-616)|Crossbones]], to steal the Serpent's hammers that Valkyrie had collected. During the battle, Valkyrie stabbed Malpractice through the chest with [[Dragonfang]], killing him.{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless Vol 1 9|10}}
