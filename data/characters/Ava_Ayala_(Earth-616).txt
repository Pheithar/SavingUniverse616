===Early Life===
The powers of Ava Ayala, alias White Tiger, came from the [[Amulets of Power|White Tiger Amulet]], inherited from her niece [[Angela del Toro (Earth-616)|Angela del Toro]]. Her family was murdered by [[Gideon Mace (Earth-616)|Gideon Mace]].{{r|Avengers Academy #24}}

===Avengers Academy===
She joined the expanded [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]] roster at the [[California (State)|California]]-based [[Avengers Compound]], as the first new full-time student since the Academy's inception.{{r|Avengers Academy #20}}{{r|Avengers Academy #21}} Her initial interest in why [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-616)|Reptil]] wasn't a more active Hispanic role model led to early tension between the two,{{r|Avengers Academy #21}} with Reptil not seeing why he needed to be more than he was.{{r|Avengers Academy #22}}

With the other students she battled the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]]{{r|Avengers Academy #23}} and [[James Marks (Earth-616)|Hybrid (Jimmy Marks)]]{{r|Avengers Academy #24}} who was banished from the school.{{r|Avengers Academy #25}} She also attended many training sessions at the school.{{r|Avengers Academy #26|28}}

===Mighty Avengers===
Ava joined the [[Heroes for Hire (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]], along with Luke Cage and [[Víctor Álvarez (Earth-616)|Víctor Álvarez]], the new Power Man. They all started believing they were meant for something more and decided to create their own Avengers team.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 #1}} Based off a hashtag, they named themselves the [[Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]].

Since joining the Mighty Avengers, Ava and Victor bonded tremendously, together they discovered two new abilities to fuse her White Tiger God based powers and his chi manipulation. The first being him able to move chi from people within their area into Ava creating a [[White Tiger]] made out of chi.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 #4.INH}} The tiger was so powerful that it was able to destroy a splinter of [[Shuma-Gorath (Multiverse)|Shuma-Gorath]].{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 3}}

Feeling grateful that Victor enabled her to control that kind of power, she later repaid him by transferring some of her power to him. Being that Ava had a lot more chi than the average person, it gave Victor tremendous amounts of power, enough to take out a Cerberus or demonic three-headed dog. He and Ava called their combo the "New York Tiger-Style Kung Fu."{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 5.INH}}

Victor helped White Tiger when she tried to kill [[Gideon Mace (Earth-616)|Gideon Mace]] for the death of her parents and was being possessed by the Tiger God that gave her powers.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 #6}} With the intervention of the [[Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]], White Tiger was prevented from crossing the line and killing Mace.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 #7}}

For her own safety, Ava was kept restrained in [[Kadesh Base|Kadesh]], the laboratory and home of her teammate [[Adam Brashear (Earth-616)|Blue Marvel]]. Disappointed by Ava's failure in killing Mace, the White Tiger god confronted her and threatened to kill her. However, Ava convinced the god that if he killed his last avatar, the Mighty Avengers would surely destroy the Amulets, endangering the White Tiger himself. Thus, Ava left the tiger divinity with the choice to submit to her or perish. The White Tiger chose the first option, giving her full control of his powers.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 7}}

===New Avengers===
After the Mighty Avengers disbanded,{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 7}} White Tiger and Power Man joined [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]]'s [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], though they stopped dating and remained only friends.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 1}}

Following an adventure in [[Rome (Italy)|Rome]], Ava was targeted by Angela del Toro, who deludedly thought that Ava had stolen the Amulets of Power from her. Angela had also been equipped with a version of the Amulets of Power from an alternate universe, acquiring the powers of a White Tiger god from another reality. During the ensuing fight, this reality's White Tiger realized that with the presence of another set of amulets and another potential avatar, he no longer needed to submit to Ava's will, and abandoned her.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 7}}

In spite of losing her powers, Ava kept pushing herself and continued carrying the mantle of the White Tiger.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 9}} A new chance for Ava to prove herself against Angela presented itself when Sunspot's [[Avenger Base Two]] was attacked by the [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]]'s [[New Revengers (Earth-616)|New Revengers]], a team which included del Toro in its ranks.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 14}} Following an arduous fight against her niece, Ava managed to snatch the Amulet of Power from her neck and break it, freeing Angela from both the Hand's and the White Tiger's possession, bringing her back to her senses in the process.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 15}}

Both White Tigers fought against the New Revengers back-to-back,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 16}} and continued working in tandem when Sunspot targeted rogue A.I.M. splinter cells to shut down. With the mission accomplished, Ava decided to retire from being the White Tiger and convinced Angela to do the same.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 18}}

===The Defenders===
Ava had seemingly become the White Tiger once more (though still without the amulet) after Luke Cage sent out a distress call to [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] to "bring everyone" while he and the [[Defenders (Manhattan) (Earth-616)|Defenders]] were in a street brawl with [[Willis Stryker (Earth-616)|Diamondback]] and his henchmen ([[Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|Fixer]], [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]], and [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Moonstone]]). Among those who answered the call along Ava were [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]], [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]], [[Maya Lopez (Earth-616)|Echo]], [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]], and Misty herself.{{r|Defenders Vol 5 9}} Whether or not Ava has embraced the mantle of White Tiger once again remains unclear.

{{Navigation
| title = Former Powers
| body = '''[[Amulets of Power]]''' enhanced Ava's strength, speed, stamina, agility, dexterity, reflexes, reaction time, coordination, balance, endurance and gave her access to experience and abilities of a master martial artist.
*'''Enhanced Strength:''' Ava's physical strength is enhanced beyond of human potential. Her physical strength is above a normal human being.
*'''Enhanced Speed:''' Ava is able to run and move at speeds superior to those of any olympic athlete.
*'''Enhanced Durability:''' Ava's body is more resistant to physical injury, to variable degrees than that of an ordinary human. She seems capable of taking several gunshot and puncture wounds as well as beatings and still stand on her feet.
*'''Enhanced Agility:''' Ava's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.
*'''Enhanced Stamina:''' Ava's body eliminates the excessive build-up of fatigue-producing poisons in her muscles and her musculature generates considerably fewer fatigue toxins than the muscles of an ordinary human being, granting her superhuman levels of stamina in all physical activities. The Amulets also sustained Ava, so she didn't need to sleep or eat as long as she wore them.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 7}}
*'''Acceleration Recuperation:''' Especially effective by placing the amulets on the wounded area of her body. She is able to heal broken bones, torn muscles, several gunshot and knife wounds and other severe injuries within moments.
*'''Heightened Animal-like Senses:''' She can see with greater clarity and greater distances than an ordinary human. Ava's vision extends into the ultraviolet and infrared areas of the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing her to see in near-total darkness and retain the same level of clarity. Ava's hearing is similarly enhanced, enabling her to detect sounds normal humans can't and sounds they ordinarily could but at much greater distances. She can track a target by scent and track them to the exact location.
*'''Camouflage:''' The White Tiger Amulets allow Ava to blend in with her surroundings if she remains perfectly still. Whilst not rendering her completely invisible to keen-eyed superheroes, they nonetheless make her easier to miss by average observers.

[[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America (Sam Wilson)]] and [[Iron Man (Anthony "Tony" Stark)|Tony Stark]] considered her to be a Gamma Level Threat.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers #1}}
