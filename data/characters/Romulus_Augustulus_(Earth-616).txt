===6th century===
Taking the title of "Tyrannus" and became a servant of the [[Olympian]] god [[Hades (Earth-616)|Pluto]] who empowered the former emperor and sent him to destroy [[Merlyn (Otherworld)|Merlin]].

He was no match against the young knight and fled leaving his master Pluto to continue the battle, who ultimatly lost and retreated back to his ream.{{r|Mystic Arcana Black Knight #1}} Merlin found Romulus and banished him beneath the Earth to realm known as [[Subterranea]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #5}} 

===Subterranea===
Trapped beneath the Earth; Romulus came upon a stockpile of [[Deviants (Race)|Deviant]] technology, which he used to attack the surface world. On one such attack, he discovered the [[Fountain of Youth]] which allowed him to remain young through the centuries.{{r|Incredible Hulk #5}}

===19th century===
In 1862, Tyrannus lead an invasion of [[Tyrannoids]] from [[Subterranea]], bursting through the ground interrupting a battle during the [[American Civil War (Event)|American Civil War]].{{r|Ruins of Ravencroft: Sabretooth Vol 1 1}}

The [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] and [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] followed but they too were captured by Tyrannus and he used Betty as a tool against them, they eventually freed her and the trio escaped Tyrannus and trapped him underground.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 5}} 

[[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Mole Man]] one of Tyrannus' leading rival regarding the rule of Subterranea stole the  "Fountain of Youth" causing him to age rapidly. He teleported the Hulk to Subterranea in hopes of recapturing the fountain. He was successful and was able to restore his youth and returned the Hulk to the surface{{r|Tales to Astonish #80|81}}

He kidnapped and forced scientist [[Ralph Roberts (Earth-616)|Dr. Ralph Roberts]] to designed a robot called the [[Cobalt-Robot (Earth-616)|Cobalt-Robot]] a giant machine used in his conflict against the Mole Man, but the [[Mutant]] team the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] came to his rescue and stopped his plans in it's tracks.{{r|X-Men #34}}

Still angry at his past defeats against the Hulk he sought out revenge by using Deviant technology to drive the creature insane and send him on a destructive rampage. He brought him beneath the surface and sent him against Mole Man along with [[Mogol (Earth-616)|Mogul]] one of his other robot slaves.{{r|Incredible Hulk #127}}

On another occasion, Tyrannus became lovers with [[Kala (Earth-616)|Kala]].{{r|Fantastic Four #127|128}}

He captured Tyrannus and in defeat he agreed to leave peacefully retreating beneath the Earth.{{r|Nova #5}}		

===They Who Wield Power===
Having failed several times to conquer the surface world through means of force and technology, Romulus decided to try another approach. His eternal youth was failing him, so it was then that he infiltrated [[They Who Wield Power (Earth-616)|They Who Wield Power]] of [[El Dorado (City)|El Dorado]], under the identity of Des.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 1 26}} The city's Sacred Flame of Life was a potential power source of immense energy. "They" engineered a number of crises on the surface world that fed additional power into the Flame, until it was ready for use. At that point, Tyrannus threw off his disguise and merged with the Flame himself, restoring his youth and granting him incredible powers. He was nevertheless defeated by the Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk #238|243}}

===Abomination===
In his quest for immortality, Tyrannus projected his consciousness into the body of the [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Abomination]], displacing Emil Blonsky.{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #15}} He quickly grew to regret his hideousness, however, and battled the Avengers on several occasions.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #25}}{{r|Solo Avengers #12}} 

===[[Atlantis Attacks]]===
Later on, Tyrannus came to serve the [[Elder Gods]], [[Set (Earth-616)|Set]], who arranged for Tyrannus to be restored to his original body.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #23}} In the identity of Dr. Tyrone, Tyrannus coordinated a new group of [[Serpent Men]] with the [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]].

===[[Subterranean Wars]]===
During the [[Subterranean Wars]], Tyrannus came under siege by the Deviant warlord [[Brutus (Deviant) (Earth-616)|Brutus]] and his army of Mutates. He was forced into an alliance with Mole Man and [[Gor-Tok (Earth-616)|Grotesk]].{{r|Avengers Annual #20}}{{r|West Coast Avengers Annual Vol 2 #6}} Separated from the Fountain of Youth and greatly fearing continuing to age at a normal rate, he kidnapped Betty Banner and Rick Jones as means to force the Hulk into retrieving the waters of the Fountain for him. Instead, the Fountain was destroyed during a fight between the Hulk and the Deviants' forces, and Bruce was only able to retrieve a small sample of the water. During her captivity, Betty had encouraged Tyrannus to accept his aging with grace, but when Banner returned and cruelly poured the last of the water on the stone floor, Tyrannus abandoned his dignity and began desperately lapping up the water from the ground.{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual #17|18}}

On another occasion, Tyrannus took possession of the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] (and also attempted to take his abilities).{{r|Hulk #1|11}}

Tyrannus was eventually overthrown by his own people, the [[Tyrannoids]], who turned Romulus into a tyrannoid for abusing them over the years, and threw him in their jail.

She helped him in stage a theft at the museum in [[Rome (Italy)|Rome]] in order to steal [[Pandora's Box (Item)|Pandora's Box]] (which is actually an Urn). The pair tricked the Hulk into helping allowing them to escape from the authorities. Dr. Banner and and [[Sofia di Cosimo (Earth-616)|Dr. Sofia Di Cosimo]] tracked them down and warned them of what would happen if they opened the Urn. The [[Knights of Rome (Earth-616)|Knights of Rome]] attacked the group in hopes of retrieving the Urn.{{r|Incredible Hulks Vol 1  #626|627}} He was able to defeat the squad of enforcers using their own magic to create a giant image of himself to defeat the Hulk.  He then opened the urn releasing "hope" but being trapped for millennia drove it insane leading it to want to destroy the world. The Hulk was able to absorb the entity and burned it away using his rage. The Red She-Hulk escaped with Tyrannus much to the annoyance of the Hulk. {{r|Incredible Hulks Vol 1  #628|629}} He took her to his kingdom beneath [[Las Vegas]] where he wanted to share the Fountain of Youth with her. They were then attacked by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] lead by [[Monica Rappaccini (Earth-616)|Monica Rappaccini]] who hoped to steal the fountain for herself turning it into a "Wishing Well". The Red She-Hulk managed to recover from the gas attack fast and stopped her but not in time to stop creatures from emerging from it that began to attack Las Vegas.{{r|Incredible Hulks Vol 1 #630|635}}
