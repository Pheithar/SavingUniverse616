===Origin & [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]]===
Josh Foley joined the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]], an anti-mutant group led by [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]], at the behest of his then best friend, Duncan. When [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]] detected a mutant in the area, [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Dani Moonstar]] and [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]] were sent to investigate. Meanwhile, the Reavers engaged a group of students from Xavier's in a fight, and Josh discovered he was a healer by healing one of his fellow Reavers. By knocking him out, he was able to hide this for a short time until he felt compelled to heal the mortally-injured [[Laurie Collins (Earth-616)|Laurie Collins]]. Laurie developed a crush on him as a result. When the Reavers discovered Josh was a mutant with healing powers, they rejected him and retreated. Angrily rejecting Moonstar's offer to go to the X-Mansion, he went home, to find his fellow Reavers waiting for him, where they delivered a severe beating. When his parents discovered he was a mutant, they disowned him.{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 5}}

[[File:Charles Xavier (Earth-616), Howard Foley (Earth-616), Joshua Foley (Earth-616), Grace Foley (Earth-616), and Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616) and from New Mutants Vol 2 7 001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Mr. & Mrs. Foley signing over Josh's guardianship]]
===[[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]]===
With nowhere else to go, Josh reluctantly went to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]]. He was paired with [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|David Alleyne]] as a roommate; a situation that neither of them initially found appealing. Josh sent a letter home which only caused his parents to make their disowning of him formal, handing his legal guardianship to the school (or more specifically to Moonstar).{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 7}} Initially, Josh became friends with [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Julian Keller]], [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Santo Vaccarro]], [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Cessily Kincaid]], and [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Victor Borkowski]]; however, after discovering Josh's history with the Reavers, they rejected him too, and the New Mutants intervened to save him.{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 8}}

Shortly after this, a depowered [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Rahne Sinclair]] visited the X-Mansion. Having only heard about her timid early days, Josh was instantly smitten by the new "wild child" Rahne much to Laurie's dismay, just as she was plucking up the courage to ask him out.{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 9}} After Rahne was rejected for a teaching post due to immaturity, Josh sneaked out of the X-Mansion at night to a bar where she was playing pool. Over the course of a conversation, he rationalized that her new attitude was a way of letting out instincts she had previously been able to blame on "the wolf." Eventually, as they were returning to the mansion, she realized that she did want "the wolf" back, contrary to her previous declarations. As they kissed, he healed away the effects of the weapon that had depowered her, but she lost control as this happened, slashing him open and howling to the moon. Laurie, looking for Josh, came across this scene and (for the first time) managed to control her power to scare Rahne away. But she couldn't return the favor from before to heal the mortally-wounded Josh.{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 10}}

[[File:Joshua Foley (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 2 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Elixir as part of the New Mutants Squad]]
As he was rushed to the mansion's infirmary, they put him on an analgesic I.V. drip. Without the presence of [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]], the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]'s other healer, there was little hope. Prodigy, however, realized that he could heal himself if only he was awake, and [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]] could wake him up with a small jolt. Reluctantly, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] went along with this, disconnecting his drip. Surge woke him up, and Laurie kept him calm long enough to for him to heal his wounds. There was one side-effect though which shocked Elixir: golden skin. This was possibly due to Elixir activating a [[Secondary Mutation]] in himself. Dani theorized that Elixir had turned his skin because he wanted to be the "golden boy".{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 12}}

===[[New Mutants Squad (Earth-616)|New Mutants Squad]]===
Following the mansion's destruction and reconstruction, [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] decided to organize the older students into six-member training squads. Josh was put on Dani's [[New Mutants Squad (Earth-616)|New Mutants Squad]] and was given the codename '''Elixir'''.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 2}}

When [[Sofia Mantega (Earth-616)|Wind Dancer]] failed on her first Field Day as leader, Laurie found her crying in their room after some harsh criticism from Josh. Laurie offered to speak to Josh. Trying to pluck up the courage to talk to him, she came across him just after he'd been turned down by Rahne again, who felt a relationship with him was inappropriate now that she was on the faculty. After Laurie mentioned the ''"Sofia thing"'', he suggested they get some dinner in town together. This date made both Rahne and [[Kevin Ford (Earth-616)|Kevin Ford]] (who still had a crush on Laurie) very unhappy. Going to a video arcade, she confessed to Josh about what her father was like, how she didn't want to be like him, and that that was why she "avoided everybody."{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 5}}

Halfway through their date they were interrupted by Rahne, who brought them back to the Institute because [[Justin Pierce (Earth-616)|Agent Pierce]] and the FBI had caught up with Kevin in relation to his accidental killing of his father.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 5}}

Soon [[Joshua Guthrie (Earth-616)|Icarus]] found the New Mutants Squad and told them the [[Hellions Squad (Earth-616)|Hellions]] and Wind Dancer had gone to break Kevin out. The New Mutants and Icarus fought with the Hellions to try to stop them from taking on the FBI until the X-Men, alerted by Rahne, turned up and took them all back to the Institute. The charges against Kevin were dismissed, and Kevin swapped squads with Icarus.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 6}}

Elixir became renowned as the in-house healer. He was able to heal [[Edward Tancredi (Earth-616)|Wing]]'s injuries from a fall orchestrated by [[Ord (SWORD) (Earth-616)|Ord]]. However, Josh was unable to undo the effects of the "[[Hope Serum|Hope Cure]]" at that time.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 5}}

Josh continued to pursue Rahne despite casually dating Laurie. Eventually Rahne decided to break things off with Josh permanently, but unbeknownst to either of them, Kevin overheard their entire conversation. Eventually, Kevin used the information to break Josh and Laurie up. Laurie was left embittered by the experience, going so far as to use her pheromones to manipulate Prodigy into kissing her at the dance in a successful attempt to make Josh jealous. This event might have gone unnoticed, but for Sofia realizing what was happening, and the event added to the fast disintegration of the squad.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #12|15}}

[[File:Joshua Foley (Earth-616) and Laurie Collins (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 24 0002.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Elixir and [[Laurie Collins (Earth-616)|Wallflower]]]]
One day, the [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]] attacked the school. He busted open the front gate, which landed on Laurie's mother [[Gail Collins (Earth-616)|Gail]], who was visiting her daughter. Gail was hurt and Laurie, in her terror, asked Josh to heal her mother as she attempted to make the Blob sleep.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 15}}

Thereafter, Wind Dancer pushed all the New Mutants into a camp out for one night on the Xavier Institute grounds. The initial attempt came to disaster: a fist-fight between Josh and David led Laurie to confess to Josh what had happened at the dance. Later that night, the New Mutants overheard Elixir pouring his heart out to Icarus, which led Laurie to forgive Josh, Josh to apologize to David for his behavior at the dance, and David to apologize for rejecting him.{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}

As the new school year began, the [[Danger Room|Danger Room]] became sentient and killed off the senior members of the X-Men in "her" attempt to find and destroy her "father," [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]]. The senior members were not dead for long, however, as Josh was able to bring them all back from the brink of death. He was visibly exhausted by his efforts.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 11}}

===[[Decimation]]===
On [[Decimation|M-Day]] the vast majority of the world's mutant population was depowered. Elixir was one of only twenty-seven students to retain their powers. Emma Frost, fearing their safety, ordered that the depowered students and staff leave the Institute. Josh's guardian Moonstar, now depowered, was among those forced to leave. For their safety, the depowered students were brought through the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlock]] tunnels to an awaiting bus. Unfortunately, the bus of depowered students was bombed by anti-mutant zealot [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Reverend William Stryker]], killing forty-two of the former students on board.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 24}}

[[File:Joshua Foley (Earth-616) and Mark Sheppard (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 24 0001.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Josh trying to save [[Mark Sheppard (Earth-616)|DJ]]]]
The remaining students were placed by Emma Frost into an all-out brawl, and the ones deemed the best by Emma would become a group of [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]] in-training. Josh made the team, and began training to become an X-Man.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 23}}

Meanwhile, Stryker consulted his "vision," and decided the "Omega threat" will be next, while holding a picture of Josh and Laurie.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 24}}

During one of their first training sessions, the New X-Men sparred with [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]]. Caught up in his emotions over the students killed as a result of Stryker's bus attack, Josh hit the powered-down Colossus over the head with a metal beam. Furious with his action, Emma kicked him off the team temporarily.

Laurie and Josh promptly had an argument about Josh's place on the New X-Men. Laurie explained that Emma was all wrong, that the team was merely about "violence and fighting," whereas Elixir could do a "beautiful thing." However, Josh told Laurie when he tried to heal [[Mark Sheppard (Earth-616)|DJ]], "I could feel him dying...his life bleeding out of him," and that "when he died, he took a piece of me with him, a piece of me died, too." At that moment, Laurie was killed by a gunshot, fired by [[Matthew Risman (Earth-616)|Matthew Risman]], an agent of Stryker.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 25}}

Laurie's body and a distraught Josh were found by several of the X-Men and students. When [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] tried to restrain Josh from Laurie's body, his mutant power manifested and caused painful boils or blisters to appear on Wolverine's hands and wrists.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 26}}

[[File:Joshua Foley (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 27 0001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Elixir's new black skin after the death of [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Stryker]]]]
When Stryker began his attack on the institute Josh sat unresponsive in the infirmary. However, Josh came to his senses, and enraged over the death of Laurie and the other students, killed Stryker by using his powers to cause massive swellings and organ failure. This action had the unforeseen result of turning his golden skin black, and Josh fell into a catatonic state.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 27}}

When [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] was mortally wounded and unable to heal during the final battle with [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]], Hellion rushed her back to the Institute. Julian gave a motivational speech, and got Josh to move beyond the past. He successfully healed Laura, his skin returning to its gold color, although some black parts remained.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 31}}

Since waking from Laurie's death, Elixir took a more peaceful approach to life. He began to wear only white clothing, and, when not studying, was often lost in thought and introspection.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #42|43}} Following those events, Elixir was orange-flagged by the O*N*E.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 33}}

[[File:Joshua Foley (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 42 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Elixir brooding in the dark]]
===Quest for Magik===
Shortly before the other students were teleported to [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]], the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] helped Elixir learn advanced human anatomy, physiology, and biology by telepathically copying information from Beast's mind into his own. This allowed him to use his power with exponentially greater precision, allowing him to regrow Prodigy's heart from nothing after it was torn out by [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]]. This proved a severe strain to Elixir however and he fell unconscious for a few moments. Later he regained consciousness and was able to use his "black abilities" to attack Belasco; however the demonic master of Limbo proved more resilient than humans and quickly recovered from the attack before being killed by [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]].

When Mercury asked Elixir about his age, he sat alone in the dark and told her instead about feeling his cells aging and dying, freaking her out. When Surge interviewed him about what happened to David in Limbo, he told her nothing happened. Still later when [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] tried to have a student/teacher conference, he still sat alone in the dark. When she asked him what he was doing, he told her he was thinking about life and death and how he could give it and take it. “With everything my powers can do...Really Miss Pryde...What can’t I do?” This scared Kitty greatly, who suggested to the other teachers that, without proper guidance, they may be raising the next [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] in Josh.

Later, [[Alani Ryan (Earth-616)|Loa]] sought out Elixir. She went to his room and flat out asked him if he wanted to make out. Elixir replied with ''"um, sure?"''.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 43}} Elixir and Loa then began dating.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}}

After the first [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|mutant birth]] [[Messiah Complex|since M-Day]], some of the New X-Men decided to launch a preemptive strike against the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]]. Elixir sat out the fight for fear that he may lose control and massacre the Purifiers in retaliation for Laurie's murder. He did however offer his help as a healer if the students needed him. When the [[Sentinels]] attacked the mansion, Elixir and some of the students left behind were knocked unconscious. 

===[[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]]===
After recovering from the Sentinel attack, Elixir was brought to [[Angel's Aerie]] to cure Wolfsbane after she was given a deliberate heroin overdose by the Purifiers. Upon healing Rahne, she attacked Josh before moving on to her real target, Angel, tearing out his wings and delivering them to Reverend Craig. Elixir healed Angel's wounds, but his attempts to regrow his wings were thwarted by the discovery that Warren's wings were never really organic and that he still carried the Apocalypse techno-organic strain.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 #4|6}}

Due to Elixir being a "problem" to X-Force, X-23 contacted the Stepford Cuckoos to help Rahne and erase Elixir's memories of the team, by Josh's request. However, before his memories could be erased, X-Force was interrupted and sent on a mission. Elixir joined X-Force and received a dark-colored uniform.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}} He helped his new team capture [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]] and reluctantly gave him an inoperable brain tumor.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 9}} While X-Force tried to retrieve a vial of the [[Legacy Virus]], Elixir abstained from the battle with the Marauders' clones. He instead hid with Vanisher, and told him that he should join the fight and help his teammates. Elixir later kept X-23 from killing herself after she became infected with the Legacy Virus and helped her get rid of it.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 10}}

Elixir, along with the rest of X-Force, was transported to the future by Cyclops in order to bring [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] and the Messiah child back to the present. Once they arrived there Elixir became hysterical over being unable to save his friends from the [[Leper Queen (Earth-616)|Leper Queen]].{{r|X-Force / Cable: Messiah War #1}}

During their stay in the future, Elixir confronted [[Nathan Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]] and along with the help of Wolverine and [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]], managed to infect him with cancer. However, Stryfe telepathically forced Elixir to heal him, undoing most of the damage. After the battle with Stryfe, he and the rest of X-Force were pulled back to the present. He, Wolverine, and Archangel hurried to the [[United Nations Headquarters|U.N.]] in order to save Surge and Hellion. Elixir cured both of his friends, but as a result of healing them combined with the exertion of time travel, Elixir fell into a comatose state.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 17}}

[[File:Joshua Foley and Kevin Ford (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 3 25 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Elixir turns black while killing [[Kevin Ford (Earth-616)|Wither]]]]
===[[Necrosha]]===
Elixir was transferred to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia Sick Bay]] under the care of [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Dr. Nemesis]]. There he was revived by the Norse goddess of death [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]] upon [[Hrimhari (Earth-616)|Hrimhari]]'s request, so that he could save Wolfsbane and their [[Tier Sinclair (Earth-616)|unborn child]]. Elixir was able to save her by transferring some of her baby's power to strengthen Wolfsbane's body (to undefined limits) to endure the [[Asgardian]] embryo growing inside her.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 22}}{{r|X-Force Vol 3 23}}

After being reunited with his team, X-Force headed to [[Genosha]] to take out [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]] and her [[Inner Circle (Selene) (Earth-616)|Inner Circle]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 24}} On Genosha, Elixir faced off against Wither in a fight to the death. Wither exclaimed he would kill Josh for failing to protect Laurie, that only Kevin himself could have saved her, and he was the only one to love her. Elixir shifted to his black form, told Kevin he always loved Laurie, and then reversed Wither's effects, turning Kevin to dust. 

Elixir quit the X-Force team, citing difficulty in shifting out of his black form.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 25}} He opted to stay on Genosha, healing and burying the corpses left by Selene and her Inner Circle, but discovered he couldn't heal anymore.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=26613 X-Position: Craig Kyle & Chris Yost]</ref>{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 309}} 

<!-- This story need to be replaced somewhere in story: Post M-Day or post-Schism ? "He came back to [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] after the [[Schism (Event)|Schism]], with no precise goal, and teamed up with him to take down [[Meltdown (Russian) (Earth-616)|Meltdown]], a russian mutant exploiting the [[Dregs (Earth-616)|Dregs]], depowered and outcasted [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]]. Seeing the Dregs rendered sick by Meltdown's "cure", he drained this sickness, healing them, and used it to take down the mutant.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 309}}" --> 

===[[Death of Wolverine]]===
In the aftermath of the death of Wolverine, Elixir was captured by the same individuals that had captured X-23, Sabretooth, Daken, Lady Deathstrike, and Mystique. As he was still stuck in his black form, he was unable to rouse Mystique after Sharp knocked her unconscious with the trigger words, however this proved to be unnecessary as Mystique had already recovered and was just feigning unconsciousness. When [[Siphon (Earth-616)|Siphon]] attacked the group shortly after, Elixir tried to use his killing powers to stop him, however these had no effect and Josh was quickly overwhelmed. Laura insisted that they needed to help, but Creed refused and demanded Sharp release them. Sharp, his team, and the captives then scattered to escape.{{r|Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy #7}}

===Utopians===
Some time later, Elixir formed part of the [[Utopians (Earth-616)|Utopians]], a group of mutants  inhabiting the ruins of the island.{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 1 40}}

The [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] were reached out by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to investigate the island after a recon team went missing. The X-Men teleported to the island, and initially engaged the Utopians. After talking it out and discovering the Utopians wanted nothing but to be safe and undisturbed, the X-Men offered them a place at the [[Weapon X Facility|New Charles Xavier School]], which they gladly accepted.{{r|All-New X-Men #41}}

===Death and Resurrection===
Several months later, Joshua was welcomed to a church, where he worked as a helper in order to figure out who he was. When the [[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Dark Riders]] began a crusade against [[Homo superior|mutant]] healers, [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]'s [[X-Men (Magneto's) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] pinpointed him as a high-risk potential target and tried to convince him to leave with them. Before they could finish talking to him, the church was attacked by the Dark Riders. Several of Joshua's friends were killed in the front yard, prompting him to go outside the building and resurrect them in panic. While he was bringing them back to life, Elixir was sniped down.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 2}}

Because of the nature of Josh's powers, however, he did not remain dead for long, regenerating in his grave before making his way back to Genosha. Emotionally and mentally unstable as a result of his experiences, he tested his expanding powers by torturing the Dark Riders, resurrecting them and killing them over and over again. Magneto and his team discovered his survival and tracked him down, eventually taking him to one of the medical centers where mutants were being treated for [[M-Pox]]. Josh was able to completely heal the mutants there, but the rush of destroying the disease ravaging him led him to nearly drain the life from the human medical personnel, and then the X-Men when they tried to stop him. Fortunately they were able to reach and stop him. Josh was taken to [[Shen Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]]'s retreat, in hopes the mutant could help Josh come to terms with the tragedies, and gain control of his powers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}}

When a cabal comprised of [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], [[Claudine Renko (Earth-616)|Miss Sinister]], and [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]] spread the power-bestowing virus [[Mothervine]] on a global scale to create a sudden growth in mutants across the world, Magneto enlisted Elixir's help to patrol every Mothervine impact zone and reverse its effects. Joshua was subsequently taken to the cabal's base, where he neutralized all samples of the Mothervine serum.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 28}} Not long afterwards, Magneto decided to return to his previous ruthless methodology to ensure mutant's survival. As part of this approach, he established a new [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Mutants]], and Elixir was one of its members.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 34}}

===Hellfire Club===
Sometime later, Elixir became a member of Emma Frost's new [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]]. While Joshua waited outside a clothing store with Vanisher they were surrounded by [[Robert Callahan (Earth-616)|General Callahan]] and soldiers of the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|Office of National Emergency]]. Emma came out of the store with [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]] while Callahan held Josh and Vanisher at gunpoint. He had a conversation with Frost about not holding up her end of their deal. This led to Vanisher getting shot by a bullet filled with a cure serum created by the [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]]. Vanisher's body turned into a goo substance while Elixir tried everything he could with his healing abilities but they were not strong enough to save him.
[[File:Joshua Foley (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 19 001.png|left|thumb|Elixir with the other Hellfire Club members]]
Elixir brought a note and some flowers from Callahan to Emma thanking her for locating [[Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-616)|Cassandra Nova]] for them. Josh asked her why was she helping the General hunt their own kind, but Emma replied that she didn't enjoy it and when the time came Callahan would get what was coming to him. All of a sudden Emma told Elixir to grab Marrow as they were about to depart. Josh stood outside of a diner while Emma talked to a revived Cyclops who didn't know Emma was there because she cloaked herself from him.

Elixir was next seen in the Hellfire Club's parking garage when Mystique, disguised as [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] brought a captured [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] there. While there was some small talk among the group, Elixir looked over to notice Wolverine and [[Kwannon (Earth-616)|Kwannon]] appeared to break up the party.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 19}}

===House of X===
Following the foundation of a sovereign nation state in [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] by the hand of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] and his allies, Elixir became a member of [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]], a group of mutants capable of combining their powers into a process of resurrection. The Five together were able to create new cloned bodies for the deceased mutants, restoring their bodies, their powers, and their memories as they were at the time of their deaths. The Five were considered as something sacred to be treasured.

Xavier tasked The Five with resurrecting [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]], [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]], [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]], [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Penance]], [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], who died stopping the creation of Nimrod.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}} The Five had previously resurrected other long deceased mutants, such as [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], and [[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]] and [[Esme Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Esme Cuckoo]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = Elixir is an [[Mutant Power Level Classification#Omega Level Mutants|'''omega-class mutant''']],{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 12}}{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}}{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}} and an '''[[Mutant Power Level Classification#Omega Level Healers|Omega Level Healer]]''',{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}} with '''Omega-class''' healing ability.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 1}} He was stated to be a '''General Threat''' by the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]], at the time of the [[M-Day]],{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}} but was orange-flagged and allegedly reclassified by the O*N*E after he used his powers offensively.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 33}}

* '''Biokinesis:''' Elixir is capable of controlling the biological structure of his own and other people's bodies down to the genetic level.{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 12}} He can produce biomolecular energy at will to affect organic matter he touches. This allows him to heal physical damage done to his body or the bodies of others, reactivate suppressed mutant abilities, repair cerebral functions, and alter the composition of his own molecules in certain ways. Because of his control over his own biology, Elixir has proven to be very difficult to treat medically. He usually passes out after pushing his powers too far and remains in a coma for some time. [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Dr. Nemesis]] guessed that during these times, his DNA reboots itself.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 18}} Elixir was scared, that he only “scratched the surface” of what he can do,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 2}} and it turned out to be true, as his abilities gradually evolved from healing simple scratches to simultaneously healing dozens of people, resurrecting himself and others, manipulating life-force, etc.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}} At first he needed to touch his targets to heal/kill them, but later learned to use powers on several targets at the same time, without touching them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 2}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}}
** '''Healing:''' At first he was capable of basic healing, having successfully healed broken bones, severe burns and even a mortal stab through the chest. After gaining [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]]’s knowledge of human anatomy, physiology and biology, Elixir has demonstrated increased mastery of his powers: regrowing Prodigy’s heart,{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 39}} sedating an enraged Wolfsbane{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}} and cleaning her body of drugs,{{r|X-Force Vol 3 4}} curing X-23 of the [[Legacy Virus]],{{r|X-Force Vol 3 10}} etc. Before his death he wasn't able to heal the [[M-Pox]], but after rebirth he simultaneously cured several mutants.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}} Josh also stated that he can burn away [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]] from [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]]'s body and cure Sabretooth from the inversion effect.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}}
*** '''Instant Regeneration:''' After rebirth Josh learned to heal himself almost as soon as he wounded.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}}
*** '''Resurrection:''' Elixir can bring people back from the dead.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 2}} This ability has expanded radically since his rebirth, to the point that Josh was able to affect 16 million deceased mutants on Genosha at once, and although it quickly drained him out of energy and he passed out, Monet and Magneto speculated, that Elixir was fully capable of resurrecting them all.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}}
**** '''Virtual Immortality:''' Although Josh can die,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 2}} he is able to resurrect himself.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}}
** '''Life-Force Manipulation:''' At first Josh only possessed the ability to sense and detect life-forces, such as when he was able to feel [[Mark Sheppard (Earth-616)|Mark Sheppard]] dying, sensing his life bleeding out of him.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 25}} Later on he learned how to transfer life-force from one person to another, as he did with Wolfsbane and her [[Tier Sinclair (Earth-616)|unborn child]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 23}} After rebirth Josh demonstrated the ability to control, manipulate and absorb the life-forces of other living creatures.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}}
** '''Genetic Detection:''' Josh is able to detect abnormalities in living beings: he detected techo-organic cells in Angel's body,{{r|X-Force Vol 3 4}} detected Emplate in Monet's body,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}} and even sensed the effect of magical inversion on Sabretooth.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}} When Josh started to cure the M-Pox he felt that the disease was afraid of him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}}
** '''Death Touch:''' He can use his powers to harm others, to cause different types of illness, massive swellings and organ failure. He managed to kill [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Stryker]] just by touching him for a few seconds,{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 27}} deadly harm the powerful demon [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]],{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 40}} and almost instantly annihilate [[Kevin Ford (Earth-616)|Wither]]’s body.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 25}} His control over his abilities is now so refined that he was able to not only give [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]] a brain tumor while healing his injuries, but even shaped it into the X-Men logo.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 8}} As with his healing abilities, Josh's ability to inflict harm has also expanded after rebirth and he now able to deadly harm even people with [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|rapid regeneration]] and [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|invulnerability]], the only reason they didn't die is because he stopped in time and reversed the process.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}}
[[File:Joshua Foley (Earth-616) and Laura Kinney (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 31 0001.png|thumb|Josh's Secondary Mutation]]
* '''Dichromatimorphic Skin:''' After Elixir used his mutant powers to heal himself, his skin turned a golden color. This is possibly due to Elixir activating a [[Secondary Mutation]] in himself.{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 12}} Elixir's skin normally remains golden, but if he uses his powers to damage or kill his skin turns a deep metallic black,{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 27}} and Prodigy theorized that it is also altered his brain chemistry.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 28}}This appears to be a completely involuntary reaction, and it has been stated that Elixir has a hard time converting from black to golden.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 25}}

| Abilities               = Due to the psychic data transfer by the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] using the knowledge of [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], Elixir now possesses genius-level understanding of human and mutant biology, anatomy, genetics, physiology and medicine.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 37}} 
| Strength                = [[Strength Scale#Normal: able to lift one's own body weight|Average human]].
| Weaknesses              =
* '''Power Limitation:''' Using his powers for extreme feats of biological manipulation can wear out his body, causing him to collapse. There have also been a few times where his powers didn't affect or only temporarily affected his enemies like Belasco{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 41}}, Siphon{{r|Death of Wolverine: The Logan Legacy #7}}, and [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]].{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 1}}
* '''Mental Illness:''' Following his death at the hands of the [[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Dark Riders]] and later self-resurrection, Josh has become dangerously emotionally unstable. Attempts to utilize his healing abilities at Magneto's direction to cure mutants afflicted with M-Pox resulted in his lashing out in madness at others around him with his death touch, severely injuring and nearly killing several innocent people before he could be subdued.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 4 1}}

* Elixir's first case of activating suppressed powers was when he reactivated Wolfsbane's wolf powers when they kissed, which caused his gold skin when he recovered.
* It is currently unknown if Elixir's gold/black skin is the result of a [[Secondary Mutation]], as diagnosed by [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], a side effect of his powers or a subconscious desire to be the "golden child".{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 12}}
** However, other speculation may be the writers poking fun at his codename, as the Philosopher's Stone, which is required to make the '''Elixir''' of Life, is also capable of turning '''Lead (Death form)''' into '''Gold (Healing form)'''.
* Josh was sixteen when he joined the {{M|New Mutants Squad}}.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 3}}
| Trivia                  = * According to the {{cl|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}, Elixir enjoys basketball, baseball, Frisbee and video games. He was also voted ''"Most Athletic."''
* Before ''[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 4|Uncanny X-Men]]'' and ''[[X-Men: Blue Vol 1|X-Men: Blue]]'' writer [[Cullen Bunn]] left the X-books, he planned to have Elixir join a group with other "absolute most power mutants" called the X-Ternals.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://cullenbunn.tumblr.com/post/183011321654/what-would-elixirs-role-in-the-brotherhood-have|title=Ending One 2nd @ a Time, What would Elixir's role in the Brotherhood have...|work=Tumblr|first=Cullen|last=Bunn|date=23 February 2019|accessdate=23 February 2019}}}}
* Elixir demonstrated an interest in Zen Buddhism.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #510}}
