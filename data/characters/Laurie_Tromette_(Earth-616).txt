===Early Years===
'''Laurie Tromette''' was always told she was incredibly bright and excelled in academics.{{r|Generation Hope #1}} Her mother wanted her to become a doctor, but she was too scared of hospitals.{{r|Generation Hope #6}}

She once got in trouble, while in high school: Her friend Melanie got her to hang out with some "cool kids" who were racing cars. Trying to fit in, Laurie raced as well but lost control, and Melanie was wounded, barely surviving. Laurie lost both her friendship with her, and the trust of her parents.{{r|Generation Hope #17}}

[[File:Laurie Tromette (Earth-616) 004.png|thumb|180px|left|Mutating]]
===The First Light===
After graduation, Laurie moved to [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]], to attend college. At nineteen years old, without warning, her [[X-Gene]] activated, and her body started undergoing a painful change. Her hair started falling out, her bones hurt, and her skin became hard, blue, and cold. She hid herself away, and spent days in a confused panic.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #526}}

[[File:Laurie Tromette (Earth-616) 001.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Flight|Flying]] for the first time after [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]]'s stabilizing touch]]
She was located by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] using [[Cerebra]].{{r|X-Men: Second Coming #2}} The X-Men sent [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] to watch over her from afar. Finally, the pain became too great, and Laurie decided to kill herself by jumping off a tall building. The X-Men arrived on the scene, along with [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], who was returning from her trip to [[Alaska (State)|Alaska]] to discover her roots. Laurie threw herself off the roof, and Hope jumped after her, grabbing her in midair. Once in physical contact with Hope, Laurie's [[Homo superior|mutation]] completed itself. She manifested blue skin, facial markings, and the power of [[Flight|flight]]. Also, the clothes she wore mysteriously disappeared. She felt instantly better, like a brand new person. She committed herself to following Hope Summers wherever she went, turning her back on her normal life.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #526}}

[[File:Laurie Tromette (Earth-616) 002.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Laurie considering her ''transonic'' speed capability]]
===The [[Lights (Earth-616)|Five Lights]]===
Laurie joined Hope and the X-Men as they continued to rescue the other [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]]. The team traveled to [[Mexico]] to stabilize [[Gabriel Cohuelo (Earth-616)|Gabriel]], supporting Hope to convince his parents to let her help,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #527}} then to [[Nigeria]] to save [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie]],{{r|Not seen in {{cl|Uncanny X-Men #528}}}} then across [[Europe]] and finally to [[Florida (State)|Florida]] while tracking [[Teon Macik (Earth-616)|Teon]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #529}} Later the group traveled to [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] to stop [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Kenji]]'s rampage. Although very reluctant, Laurie aided Hope as she ignored [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]' orders, and saved Kenji.{{r|Generation Hope #1|4}}

[[File:Generation Hope Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]]]]
Once the Lights arrived on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]]'s [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Doctor Nemesis]] began testing the Lights' powers, and discovered Laurie was not only capable of flight, but also of transonic speed, and that her body would ''"alter to give [her], frankly freakish maneuverability"''.{{r|Generation Hope #4}} Laurie agreed to stay on Utopia and continued to follow Hope, troubled by her rebellious attitude, while being committed to her own training and learning. She was also seemingly affected by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]'s statement that Hope would be the end of them.{{r|Generation Hope #5}}

Meanwhile, the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service (Earth-616)|C.S.I.S (Canadian Security Intelligence Service)]] sent inquiries to [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]], who stated they were presumably intending to recruit Laurie among the "''depleted ranks''" of [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]], and recommended to [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Scott Summers]] to maintain good relations with the Canadian Government in regards to her.{{r|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}}

===[[Quarantine]]===
Although a newly activated mutant, Laurie was affected as well as other mutants by the [[HX-N1]]; [[Sublime Corporation (Earth-616)|Sublime Corporation]] somehow managed to acquire data on her and adapt it to the "X-Flu".{{r|Uncanny X-Men #531}}

It's unknown if she was among the near-all mutants of Utopia to join the fight against [[Sublime Corporation (Earth-616)|Sublime Corporation]].<ref>She wasn't seen in {{cl|Uncanny X-Men #534}}</ref>

Along with [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie]], she convinced Hope to quit her hobbies (taking care of her guns) and instead go shopping, only for the three girls to get attacked by [[Frank Bohannan (Earth-616)|Crimson Commando]]'s troops and Hope captured. Laurie was the one to speed to Utopia, for her to warn the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #539}}

===[[Fear Itself]]===
When the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut/Kuurth]] came to [[San Francisco]], Laurie was among those whose powers were borrowed to help Hope remove Kuurth's helmet.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #539}}

===The [[Sixth Light (Earth-616)|Sixth Light]]===
With a desire to master her powers and learn her limits, Laurie continued training{{r|Generation Hope #5}} and testing with Doctor Nemesis and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], those tests showing her shape-shifting ability.{{r|Generation Hope #6}} Laurie accompanied the team on their first mission to [[Berlin]] to find a [[Sixth Light (Earth-616)|new mutant]],{{r|Generation Hope #6}} and fully developed her shape-shifting. She was the key to the victory, managing to understand the new mutant's logic, but was unable to make the unborn accept its birth.{{r|Generation Hope #7}}

At the time [[Teon Macik (Earth-616)|Teon]]'s parents were suing the X-Men over their son's guardianship, Hope decided that her Lights needed code-names, and Laurie's choice was seemingly already '''Transonic'''.{{r|Generation Hope #8}}

After the trial, [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Kenji]] and Laurie discussed their strange ties with [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]] and planned to find out what's going on, both suspecting Hope to have some twisted influence on them.{{r|Generation Hope #8}}

When [[Zeeshan (Earth-616)|Zeeshan]] the Seventh Light activated, the Lights were dispatched. Laurie decided to speed up on her own, only to find him dead; Zeeshan had committed suicide due to the nature of his powers, sending telepathic pain to the team seemingly as part of a link bonding the Lights together.{{r|Generation Hope #9}}{{r|Generation Hope #12}}

[[File:Lights (Earth-616) Generation Hope Vol 1 10.png|thumb|right|260px|The [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]] react to [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie]]'s actions]]

===[[Schism (Event)|Schism]]===
While [[Sentinels]] were unleashed over the world, Laurie decided to go the opening of the [[Museum of Mutant History]] with [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie]], as she thought she had to learn more about the mutant culture. The [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] attacked the opening and Idie and Laurie sought to defend the attenders.{{r|Generation Hope #10}}

After Idie killed the attackers, Laurie and Hope argued about what role she could have had in preventing it. At the end of that argument, Laurie shouted loud the feeling she had about Hope's influence on the Lights, and was shocked to hear Idie react as a heartless murderer.{{r|Generation Hope #10}}

[[File:Generation Hope Vol 1 11 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]] in the shadow of the giant [[Sentinels|Sentinel]]]]
Once back to Utopia, Laurie took care of Oya.{{r|X-Men: Schism #4}} She quickly realized that the island was protected only by the students and [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]. It was up to them to stop the giant Sentinel heading to the Island and they had to organize an evacuation despite the lack of [[X-Men Blackbird|Blackbirds]]. Hope stated that they had to stay and fight and Laurie was forced by her influence, but resisted, launching a brawl amongst the Lights which was stopped only by Idie's speech. Laurie then reluctantly agreed to stand the line, while having already decided that Idie had to be taken off Utopia for her own sake. She also had a brief talk with [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Zero]] about taking down Hope once and for all.{{r|Generation Hope #11}}

They were joined in the coming fight by the young X-Men [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|Prodigy]], [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]], [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]], and [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]].{{r|Generation Hope #11}} After the first argument between [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and Cyclops, Laurie remained on the front line with her teammates, but fled with the rest when Wolverine threatened to blow off Utopia.{{r|X-Men: Schism #4}}

While the two mutant leaders battled, the younglings came back with [[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob Herman]], [[Nezhno Abidemi (Earth-616)|Gentle]], [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]], and the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Three-In-One]], destroying the Sentinel.{{r|X-Men: Schism #5}}

[[File:Lights (Earth-616) from Generation Hope Vol 1 13 002.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Post-[[Schism (Event)|Schism]] [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]]]]
===[[Regenesis (Event)|Regenesis]]===
After the [[Schism (Event)|Schism]], Laurie remained on Utopia but as she wanted to get Idie away from Hope, she went so far as to point a gun at Hope.{{r|Generation Hope #12}} At that moment Hope started to talk about her [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|father]], and after a conversation, Laurie managed to convince Hope to agree to let Idie go with Wolverine.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}} That decision of Hope made Laurie slightly change her mind, and break from Zero's project to take the Mutant Savior down.{{r|Generation Hope #12}} Trance started to have some feeling for Kenji but was spotted by both him and Hope.{{r|Generation Hope #13}}

Laurie later attended [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]]'s combat class with other students.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 1}} She was also present at the arrival of an [[Earth-TRN192|alternate]] [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-TRN192)|Storm]] (unknown to Laurie) and her fight with Cyclops before both left.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 #44}}

The Lights, along with recruit [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]], intercepted [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]] when he was heading to kill Cyclops and confronted Wolverine's X-Men.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #262}} The call had been sent to the [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|Extinction Team]], but the other X-Men were already responding to another crisis, forcing Hope to take only the remaining children.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #263}}

Misinterpreting a light near the [[China|Chinese]] border of [[Pakistan]] as a new mutant manifestation, Hope assembled Laurie and the Lights, but when they arrived they found an amnesiac [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]] strapped to a suicide bomb.{{r|Generation Hope #13}} During the explosion No-Girl's tank was damaged leaving her unsustained and exposed. However, Zero acted quickly and created a body for her. The team and Shaw narrowly escaped further injury from [[Jin Billion (Earth-616)|Jin Billion]] and his Butchers.{{r|Generation Hope #14}}

[[File:Generation Hope Vol 1 17 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Zero]]'s machinations]]
Trance was revolted by the X-Men's treatment of Shaw upon their return, who was immediately attacked and imprisoned for his past crimes. She also became concerned for Gabriel, due to the fact he burned his life force each time he used his powers. 

The Lights were soon attacked by [[Litterbug (Earth-616)|Litterbug]], [[Bliss (Morlock) (Earth-616)|Bliss]], [[Tamara Kurtz (Earth-616)|Dragoness]], [[Marshall Stone III (Earth-616)|Random]], and [[Erg (Earth-616)|Erg]], former Morlocks who claimed that all the attention as fighters of mutantkind went to the Lights instead of them. Laurie answered to Dragoness that she was left out because she was an ex-[[Mutant Liberation Front (Earth-616)|M.L.F.]] terrorist, launching a fight between the two groups. After Hope stopped the fight using her mimicry powers and her influence over the Lights, Laurie had trouble sleeping through the night.{{r|Generation Hope #15}}

When Zero began to finalize his plans to betray and murder Hope, Trance was reluctant but still furious over Hope's influence on her. She assisted initially to take down Hope without being controlled by Kenji (for weeks Zero had been telepathically and subtly turning Utopians against Hope). When Laurie rebelled, however, she was timely saved by the other Lights and the group engaged in a brawl with the mind-controlled Utopians. Hope and No-Girl combined their powers to kill Zero.{{r|Generation Hope #17}}

During a following debriefing session, Shaw was fully inducted and the group reconciled some of the problems they had been facing. Laurie and Hope in particular succeeded in putting aside their differences.{{r|Generation Hope #17}}

When the [[Peak VII]] suffered a massive break-out of alien prisoners, [[Unit (Earth-616)|Unit]] mimicked the signature of a new Light, forcing Hope to separate from her Extinction Team duty to assemble her Lights and go on rescue. Soon realizing the trap, Laurie and the other were teleported by Pixie while under Unit's control, and put to sleep by his powers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 9}}

===[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]===
====Hope's Escape====
When the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] invaded Utopia, Hope was handed by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] to the Lights for them to prevent her from leaving. Laurie was the fourth team member to have her nose broken by Hope, who was furious of the situation. Using her [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] power, Hope defeated all of her teammates and Avengers Wolverine and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] before leaving.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #2}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 11}}

[[File:Younger X-Men (Earth-616) from Avengers Academy Vol 1 29 0001.jpg|thumb|right|270px|At the [[Avengers Compound]]]]
====Protective Services / The Search for Hope====
The Lights and their recruits, along with most of the [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]], were left behind by the X-Men and sent to the [[Avengers Compound]] of [[Los Angeles]], school of the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]]. [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] proposed to keep up the Avengers vs. X-Men war by throwing Olympic games. Transonic competed against [[Julie Power (Earth-616)|Lightspeed]], and slightly lost, but had started the race an instant after her Avenger adversary.{{r|Avengers Academy #29}}

Along with most with her teammates, she tried to breakout from the Campus, but were blocked by some of the Avengers students, while other students joined the X-Men side. The arrival of [[Juston Seyfert (Earth-616)|Juston Seyfert]] and his [[Sentinel (Juston) (Earth-616)|Sentinel]] redistributed forces further, much to Laurie's annoyance.{{r|Avengers Academy #30}}

[[File:Laurie Tromette (Earth-616) and Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616) from Avengers Academy Vol 1 31.jpg|thumb|left|Assaulting [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat]]]]
Sebastian Shaw escaped his captivity at the Compound and came to help the students. Mistaken as an intended assassin of the X-students, [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat]] blasted him, but was in turn attacked by Transonic. [[Ken Mack (Earth-616)|Mettle]] managed to best her, which launched a new brawl amongst the factions. [[Jeanne Foucault (Earth-616)|Finesse]] and [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] used their abilities to discover that Shaw wasn't intending to kill the mutants, but help them escape. After a fake battle between the Avengers and X-Men (with Avengers on both sides in order to prevent any suspicion from the faculty), the mutants were free to leave. Laurie decided she wanted to find Hope, to back her up, and settle the tension between them. Both Gabriel and Teon agreed to follow her.{{r|Avengers Academy #31}}

[[File:Lights (Earth-616) 004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Lights listening to [[Unit (Earth-616)|Unit]]]]
The four Lights arrived on Utopia and found a note from Hope stating simply ''"Sorry. Ask Unit."'', leading them to visit the robot in the [[X-Brig]]. Unit recounted to them an event from a billion years prior of a planet where he witnessed the rulers' [[Demon Lords of Stasis (Earth-616)|demons]] cast a spell to stop Evolution. This angered the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]]. The spell worked for a time, until a [[Phoenix Messiah (Demon) (Earth-616)|Phoenix Messiah]] arose and, with [[Lights (Demons) (Earth-616)|five acolytes]], she was able to commune with the Phoenix, broke the spell, swept away the Demons, and restarted evolution. Thereafter, Unit grew interested in the Phoenix Force, and desired to see a Phoenix Messiah rise without the means to control the Phoenix (the Lights).{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 13}}

Distracted by what to do with this information, Unit used [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]] to take Pixie and the rest of the team down, asphyxiating Laurie with a hard light cube around her head. The Lights were left by Danger on a beach under the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], having been implanted with new memories that they had received injuries during their escape of the Avengers Compound. While on the beach they witnessed a burst of light on the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]], thinking of it as shooting stars or an eclipse, when in fact it was the emergence of the [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 13}}

====Aftermath====
Hope stayed in touch with Laurie, sending her some letters about her life in a flatscans school.{{r|AvX: Consequences #3}}

===[[Jean Grey School For Higher Learning]]===
At the time of the trip to the [[Savage Land]] by Wolverine and the [[Special Class (Earth-616)|Special Class]], Transonic was part of the student roster.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #25}} She was later seen during Wolverine's speech preceding the burying of a "time capsule".{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #29}} At some point she assaulted [[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob Herman]] as he was bothering her about the fact her costume was simply being naked all the time.{{r|Avengers Arena #13}}

She also kept in contact with [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|Prodigy]], asking him to join the Jean Grey School, as she was driven mad by the lack of intellectual peers for her there.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 6}}

===Helping the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]]===
In order to battle [[Mother (Interdimensional Parasite) (Earth-TRN287)|Mother]], Prodigy called for [[Alexander Power (Earth-616)|Alex Power]] and Laurie, who herself called in [[Xavier Institute student body#Jean Grey School students|Jean Grey School students]] [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] and [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Oya]]. The latter two called for more students as well to support the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]]. Laurie wasn't able to reach [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 11}}

As the last meeting between Mother, [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]], and [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] didn't end well, [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] decreed ''"Avengers Assemble"'' to the vast troop of young heroes of the Thin Spandex Line. Soon, an army of alternate [[Young Avengers]] were unleashed on [[Central Park]], and Transonic battled a patched-eyed [[Noh-Varr]] and an alternate [[Kate Bishop]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 12}} Exchanging with Alex Power during the battle, she was troubled by the fact that no adult came to help them, with the [[Avengers Mansion]] close by. Alex replied that they were the Avengers for now, before both were taken down by [[Jeff Kaplan (Earth-616)|Jeff]] and [[Rebbecca Kaplan (Earth-616)|Rebbecca Kaplan]] (Wiccan's parents). The invasion was eventually thwarted by the Young Avengers who were fighting in Mother's [[Earth-TRN287|dimension]]. Upon Mother's death, the alternate young Avengers were sent back to her dimension, beaten and restored to their own realms. The young heroes returned home to feast with their allies, Laurie welcoming Prodigy with a hug.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 13}}

Laurie was later present at the after/New Year's party, a thank you from Hawkeye for the help she had offered in the battle, but had to deal with the lack of good behavior from [[Kubark (Earth-616)|Kid Gladiator]], who shouted that he could have dealt with the threat on his own. She was able to escape the uncomfortable situation and took Kubark with her as Kate dealt with her ex-boyfriend [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Noh-Varr]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 14}}

At the time the Young Avengers left the party (2:05am), she and Rockslide carried Pixie to the [[X-Men Blackbird|Blackbird]] to a seemingly disapproving [[Doop (Earth-616)|Doop]], as she had fallen asleep.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 15}}

===No More Humans===
During the No More Humans crisis, Laurie was at the Grey School among the students who witnessed the arrival of other dimension mutant refugees, among them [[Stonewall]] of [[New Amsterdam]], coming to them in search of a sanctuary promised by [[Raze Darkholme (Earth-TRN311)|Raze]].{{r|X-Men: No More Humans #1}}

She was also present during the Trimegas attack on the school, taking cover and presumably retreating immediately.{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 4}}

When [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] assembled teams of students to take action against [[Future (Earth-616)|The Future]] after he wounded two of them, Laurie was present, but not part of the first team sent.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 16}}

With other students, she watched the television coverage of [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]]'s actions in [[Santo Marco (Country)|Santo Marco]] in favor of the poor and against the government-covered [[Suncorp (Earth-616)|Suncorp]] society.{{r|Storm #1}}<!-- Issue with nothing appearing: "Laurie was seen at school.{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 5}}" -->

She participated in a workshop with Beast and other students, creating an instantaneous orbital teleportation link from the power of domesticated [[Bamfs]]{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men #4}} for the Annual Jean Grey School Science Fair, a contest between Beast's team and then teacher Spider-Man's [[Special Class (Earth-616)|Special Class]]. Instants later, she battled the [[Symbiotes (Race)|Symbiotes]]-possessed [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] that came from the portal her team had built.{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men #5}}

Transonic was at the school when Ororo returned triumphantly from her adventures. She was also seen participating in the school garden work.{{r|Storm Vol 3 10}}<!-- Issue with nothing appearing: only flashback/recap from Kenji's death{{r|Storm Vol 3 11}} -->

Transonic was present at the "trial of Henry McCoy", where the X-Men and students of both schools gathered to discuss Beast's tampering with time and genetics, and the danger he was creating for mutants. She was presumably sent to [[Washington, D.C.]] along with all the other people present, to hear Cyclops' speech on the [[Mutant Revolution]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #600}}<!-- Secret War happened then -->

===M-Pox===
Transonic was among the mutants who went to [[Limbo (Otherplace)|Limbo]] along with the school due to the [[M-Pox]] epidemic and was later among the X-Men dispatched to retrieve the mutant [[Sapna (Earth-616)|Sapna]] as she was attacked by [[demons]].{{r|Extraordinary X-Men #3}} Sometime after this, she participated in the birthday party of [[Evan Sabahnur (Earth-616)|Evan Sabahnur]] in the ruins of [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]].{{r|All-New X-Men Vol 2 9}}

Once the [[M-Pox]] problem was solved, and mutants and Inhumans ceased the conflicts between them, the school was brought out of Limbo. However, the school was not brought back to Westchester, but rather to [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], where they'd not be hiding anymore. Laurie resumed her studies and was seen among other students on a field trip to an art gallery with Kitty Pryde and [[Old Man Logan]].{{r|Star-Lord Vol 2 1}} She was also part of the training game for [[Trevor Hawkins (Earth-616)|Eye-Boy]].{{r|Generation X Vol 2 5}}

When [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]]/[[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]] assaulted the School, she was one of the first to be assaulted and drained, along with [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]].{{r|Generation X #85}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Laurie was one of the many mutants that opposed the crazed [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] from remaking the world in his image. When X-Man realized that his vision of the world would never come about with the X-Men around, X-Man made his enemies vanish in an instant, including Laurie.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9|10}}

===Age of X-Man===
Laurie and the others were transported to another [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|plane of existence]] by X-Man created in an attempt at a utopia where they and all other mutants would be at peace, altering their memories so they wouldn't resist.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}

Laurie was one of a group of mutants who was a follower of [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|En Sabah Nur]] who, along with [[Victor Borkowski (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Anole]], [[Maggott (Japheth) (Earth-616)|Maggott]], [[Ben Hammil (Earth-616)|Match]], and [[Scripture (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Scripture]] were engaged in plan to set off an explosion at the [[Hope Summers Memorial Library]] in order to end the fake memories that had plagued them.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 2}}

Laurie returned to the real world after X-Man allowed the mutants he trapped into his reality to leave.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}} Laurie became a citizen of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] and was shown hanging out with other mutants at the [[Green Lagoon]].{{r|X-Force Vol 6 9}}

[[File:Laurie Tromette (Earth-616) 006.jpg|thumb|left|Modeling to aerodynamic shape]]
Laurie is one of post-[[Decimation|M-Day]] [[Homo superior|mutant]] activation's. Her powers include:
*'''[[Superhuman Speed]]'''
*'''[[Flight]]:''' She can fly at supersonic speeds.
**'''Shifting Crystal Skin:''' Transonic has blue crystalline/scaly skin that possesses reactive properties that change her physical form to grant enhanced maneuverability and/or speed. In a controlled setting, Laurie morphed under high winds and changed consistency. When she flew into the skies with Idie she underwent a remarkable transformation which had her gain more physical characteristics: her body changed shape to become larger and winged (resembling a flying fish) when traveling at high altitudes for more maneuverability and became missile-shaped when traveling at high speeds to become more aerodynamic, though this did not last for long as she had to go back down again.

The status of post-[[M-Day]]-activated mutant gave her also the following characteristic:
*'''Lights Bonding:''' The Lights were shown to be linked each other, to [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]] and to the new activations, with some low level control from Hope over them. They were also affected by the suicide of [[Zeeshan (Earth-616)|Zeeshan]].{{r|Generation Hope #9}} That situation was witnessed by Laurie and [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Kenji]],{{r|Generation Hope #8}} and later by [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]].{{r|Generation Hope #12}} Also, when the [[Sixth Light (Earth-616)|Sixth Light]] activated, all of the Lights were able to sense it.{{r|Generation Hope #6}}

| Abilities               = * Laurie has no or few skills in shooting, stating she isn't a "''shooty-Canadian''".{{r|Generation Hope #5}} She seemed to have become way more comfortable with weapons now, using some in the field, although she dislikes to do so.{{r|Generation Hope #13}}

| Notes                   = * She received a 1590 on her SAT, even though she was in [[Vancouver]], [[Canada]], where they don't have the SAT. Laurie expressly stated she is Canadian.{{r|Generation Hope #5}} She was also of interest to the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service (Earth-616)|C.S.I.S (Canadian Security Intelligence Service)]].{{r|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}} She is possibly a dual citizen.
* Creators [[Matt Fraction]] and [[Kieron Gillen]] loosely based the [[Lights (Earth-616)|Five Lights]] mutant powers on the the archetypal power-sets on the original five [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] (with the exception of [[Gabriel Cohuelo (Earth-616)|Gabriel]]).<ref name="x-position Gillen">[https://www.cbr.com/x-position-kieron-gillen-3/ X-POSITION: Kieron Gillen]</ref>

* [[Kieron Gillen]] described her as ''"the team's Angel. A physically enhanced flyer with a form that's adapted for that purpose. [...] she's one of the purer characters on the team: a bookish, emotionally anal girl in chains to her own self-demands has to learn how to fly. She's very much superpower as metaphor for character's emotional struggle. [...] She's very much the team's "Captain Sensible" character, stepping in and doing the "Wait, we're going to do what?" when the more foolhardy and headstrong people are thinking they're immortal.<ref name="x-position Gillen"/>
* Laurie's costume or naked state seems to be an obsession to some students, who asked twice to have more information about it:
** When asked by [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]] if she was naked, she answered that she is naked but not "'''''naked'''-naked''" and that her flesh turns into a costume, of sorts. Rockslide then asked her why she wears anything at all, when she could go like the Thing. Laurie responded the it was the same reason why he does not wear a swimsuit. He then asked her could she "''go '''more''' naked''," to which she replied that she was not going to demonstrate for him.{{r|Generation Hope #12}}
** [[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob Herman]] came himself later with that subject as well, asking if her ''"costume's kinda really just being '''naked''''', to which she simply assaulted him.{{r|Avengers Arena #13}}
| Trivia                  = * Laurie was probably about 17 or 18 at the time of her mutation, although Cyclops stated she was nineteen-year-old,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #526}} because she was enrolled in college in [[Vancouver]]. However, it is possible that she is a year or two younger because it is also stated that she is extremely intelligent and may have graduated from high school early.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #526}}{{r|Generation Hope #1}} It was confirmed by [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]] that she was 18 at the time of the [[Schism]].{{r|Generation Hope #11}}
* While in school she wrote a sociology paper entitled ''"The Effect of Post-Human Conflict On The New York Teenager's Worldview"'', and got an A+ for it.{{r|Generation Hope #1}}
* Laurie hates camping,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 9}} is scared of hospitals,{{r|Generation Hope #6}} and although using some, she dislikes the use of guns.{{r|Generation Hope #5}}{{r|Generation Hope #13}}
* She thought that her parents would be disappointed if she became an [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Man]], and that they would want her to be an [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avenger]] or a member of [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]].{{r|Generation Hope #1}} [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]] hypothesized that the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service (Earth-616)|C.S.I.S (Canadian Security Intelligence Service)]] was interested in her possibly in order to restore the ''"depleted"'' ranks of Alpha Flight.{{r|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}} In fact, her mother wanted her to became a doctor.{{r|Generation Hope #6}}
