===The Hulk===
Peter Corbeau became a world-renowned physician, Nobel Prize winner. When the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] was captured by the army with tranquilizer bombs and taken to Dr. Corbeau. He used a device that manipulates the sun's energy, thus neutralizing the gamma rays in Hulk, curing Dr.Banner. Meanwhile, [[Jarella (Earth-616)|Jarella]] is sent to [[Earth]] by her wizards in search for her lover, the Hulk. She needs him by her side to defeat the tyrant [[Visis (Earth-616)|Lord Visis]]. Somehow, Corbeau's process and Jarella's appearance caused an adverse effect in the sun, threatening its very existence. Instead of sending the princess back to her microscopic world, the army creates a replicate. But before they send it, Visis sends [[Fialan (Earth-616)|Fialan]] the assassin to kill Jarella. Hulk fights Fialan but an explosion kills Jarella's replicate. The green monster thinks the girl is dead and smashes Fialan. When Jarella appears, the army uses gas to knock the Hulk out, and the princess is sent willingly back to K'ai.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 148}}
