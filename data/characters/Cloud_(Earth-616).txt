Cloud subsequently joined the Defenders, but remained confused about their true origins. They began to fall in love with their teammate [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]], due to the subliminal telepathic signals Moondragon was sending out to manipulate others, and found themself shapeshifting into Danny Milligan's form to be "better equipped" to love Moondragon. This only further confused Cloud and others as to their true origins.

Cloud eventually regained their full memories and led the Defenders out into space to stop the Star-Thief from killing their family. They resumed their appointed place in the cosmos.{{r|Defenders #150}}

Most recently, now preferring the pronoun 'They', Cloud reappeared as a member of Doctor Strange's new Defenders.{{r|Defenders Vol 6 #1}}
