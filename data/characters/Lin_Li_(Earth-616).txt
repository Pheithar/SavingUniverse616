===Jean Grey School for Higher Learning===
Not much is known about '''Lin Li''''s past, but at some point, she started attending the [[Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]]. On her first day, she was given a tour of the school by [[Trevor Hawkins (Earth-616)|Trevor Hawkins]] (also known as Eye-Boy). During the tour, Trevor's daydreaming caused him to miss her entire conversation with [[Krakoa III (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] and, with Lin Li choosing not to talk him, he was led to believe she was mute. Later that day, their fellow student [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]] destroyed the canteen walls while chasing [[Demon Bamfs|Bamfs]] through the hallways. This led to Lin developing an immediate bond with the Bamfs, who tried to find safety from Rockslide on Lin's shoulders.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 2 1}}{{r|Generation X Vol 2 3}}{{r|X-Men Unlimited Infinity Comic Vol 1 6}}

When [[John Break-Sky (Earth-13729)|Faithful John]] arrived at the Jean Grey School in order to kill [[Evan Sabahnur (Earth-616)|Genesis]] before he could become the "next Apocalypse", he telepathically ordered the Bamfs to attack the students. To distract John and save her fellow teammates, Lin Li, now going by Nature Girl, commanded dozens of birds to fend off the Bamfs, giving Oya the chance to knock the villain out.{{r|{{cl|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 2 3}}-[[Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 2 4|4]]}}

===Generation X===
When [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] relocated the X-Men to [[Central Park]] and the school was renamed to the Xavier Institute for Mutant Education and Outreach, Lin Li decided to join in. She became part of [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]]'s team and was reunited with Eye-Boy.{{r|Generation X Vol 2 2}}

[[File:Trevor Hawkins (Earth-616) and Lin Li (Earth-616) Generation X Vol 1 87.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]
Once, Lin and Trevor were tasked to babysit and protect [[Shogo Lee (Earth-616)|Shogo]], Jubilee's son. To do so, Nature Girl brought the two to the Central Park Zoo, inside the Bears' Den, despite Eye-Boy's concerns. While they were there and Shogo was having fun playing with the bears, the bears sensed danger and roared viciously. Eye-Boy picked up Shogo immediately and carried him away, and Lin Li summoned a trio of vultures to take them back to school and help handling the return of Krakoa.{{r|Generation X Vol 2 8}}

After many adventures together, Lin Li told Trevor that she was aware of his feelings for her, but the two simply remained friends.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 85|87}}

===Age of X-Man===
Sometime later, Lin was transported to a reality created by [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]], as an attempt to create a utopia for mutants to live in. Those Nate brought there had their memories of their previous lives erased so there would be no resistance.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}
[[File:Lin Li (Earth-616) from Age of X-Man The Marvelous X-Men Vol 1 1 001.jpg|180px|thumb|right|In the Age of X-Man Reality]]

In this altered plane of existence, Lin was part of the official X-Men team and her appearance had been changed as well, with her antlers being larger than before.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}

When Nate’s Utopia eventually fell apart, Lin’s appearance was reverted to normal and all her real-world memories were returned. Still, she was incredibly reluctant to go back to reality along with [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]]. She even begged Nate to let her stay, but, in the end, she didn’t have a choice.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

=== Krakoa ===
Lin Li eventually joined the new Mutant Nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 7}} and, after a while, took part in the Wild Hunt organized by the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]], along with other young mutants that [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Dani Moonstar]] believed needed guidance.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 14}}

Her need for guidance was never as clear as when the death of a sea turtle, caused by a plastic bag, sent her on a vengeful journey to make humanity pay for their crimes against the planet. Using one of Krakoa's [[Gateway]]s, she traveled to [[Las Vegas]] in order to find the ones responsible. She confronted the owner of Owen's Grocery, the brand of the plastic bag, and, after growing disgruntled by his apathy about the loss of animal lives, Lin jabbed the complacent store owner in the neck with a pair of scissors.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Infinity Comic Vol 1 5}}

[[File:Lin Li (Earth-616) from X-Men Unlimited Infinity Comic Vol 1 5 002.jpg|thumb|left|180px|On the run with Saoirse]]
The police were called to the scene and sent a trained dog to apprehend her, but, using her powers, Nature Girl tamed and befriended the canine, who also communicated its dissatisfaction with the way the planet was treated by humans. Lin then summoned several creatures of the wild as a distraction, as she made an escape with her new friend, whom she renamed Saoirse.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Infinity Comic Vol 1 5}}

She would soon be pursued by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], under orders of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]], when they became aware that she'd killed a human in Vegas,{{r|X-Men Unlimited Infinity Comic Vol 1 5}} but the young mutant and her new companion managed to sidestep the former hunter with the aid of a bear and a wolf pack. Meanwhile, she gained an ally in the young mutant [[Curse (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Curse]], and the pair killed a few workers of an oil company that was polluting the environment.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Infinity Comic Vol 1 6|7}}
