| Overview                = James Howlett was born to a wealthy Canadian family at the end of the 19th century, being the son of [[Elizabeth Hudson (Earth-616)|Mrs. Elizabeth Howlett]] and [[John Howlett, Sr. (Earth-616)|her husband]]'s employee, [[Thomas Logan (Earth-616)|Thomas Logan]]. He was forced to abandon his family after the tragic murder of his father, a situation which caused his [[Homo superior|mutant]] bestial abilities of accelerated [[healing factor]], keenly enhanced senses and bone claws in each hand to manifest. Adopting the name '''Logan''', he wandered the world, living a long life filled with blood, war and betrayal,{{r|{{cl|Wolverine: The Origin Vol 1 1}}-[[Wolverine: The Origin Vol 1 6|6]]}} having vile [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] as his archenemy{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 10}} and the Japanese warrior [[Ogun (Ninja) (Earth-616)|Ogun]] as his sensei.{{r|{{cl|Kitty Pryde and Wolverine Vol 1 1}}-[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine Vol 1 6|6]]}} Unfortunately, by always acting as a lone wolf, Logan was an unwitting subject of the [[Weapon X Project (Earth-616)|Weapon X program]] and had his bones coated in indestructible [[Adamantium]], becoming an even more lethal asset.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 73|84}} He was rescued and assisted by [[James Hudson (Earth-616)|Mac]] and [[Heather McNeil (Earth-616)|Heather Hudson]], joining [[Department H (Earth-616)|Department H]] as a Canadian government operative known as the '''Wolverine'''.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 31|32}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 180|182}}

Later, Logan was invited by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] to join the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|'''X-Men''']], a team of heroes fighting for peace between humans and mutants.{{r|Giant-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}} Proving to be a challenging addition to the X-Men due to his aggressive behavior, Wolverine was constantly in conflict with his fellow teammate [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]. However, he gradually grew fond of the X-Men, considering them to be his new family.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 121}} Always a recurrent member of the X-Men, Wolverine also became a noteworthy member of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 6}} He also ran the secret mutant strike team known as [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] to ensure mutantkind's survival by employing lethal force.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 1}} Wolverine was also responsible for reforming the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School]] after definitely parting ways with Cyclops and leading his own faction of X-Men.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis Vol 1 1}}

When all mutantkind was granted asylum by Professor Xavier on the mutant-exclusive nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], Wolverine was one of the first of its residents.{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}} Although currently suspicious of the cost of this apparent safeplace for mutants,{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 1}} Wolverine stepped in once again as the field leader of X-Force, an intelligence organization in charge of special operations to counter-attack assaults against Krakoa.{{r|{{cl|X-Force Vol 6 1}}-[[X-Force Vol 6 6|6]]}}

<center>''This is an abridged version of Wolverine's history. For a complete history see '''[[James Howlett (Earth 616)/Expanded History|Wolverine's Expanded History]]'''''</center>

===Early Years===
[[File:Wolverine The Origin Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Dog, Rose and James]]
Logan's life began in Cold Lake, [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], sometime between 1882 and 1885.{{r|Wolverine: The Origin #2}} The [[Homo superior|mutant]] who would come to be known simply as "Logan" was born James Howlett, the illegitimate son of [[Elizabeth Hudson (Earth-616)|Elizabeth Howlett]] (who was married to [[John Howlett, Sr. (Earth-616)|John Howlett]], owner of a large estate) and the Howletts' groundskeeper, [[Thomas Logan (Earth-616)|Thomas Logan]]. As a boy, James was notably frail and prone to bouts of allergic attacks. He was largely neglected by his mother, who had been institutionalized for a time following the death of her first son, [[John Howlett, Jr. (Earth-616)|John Jr.]]

James spent most of his early years on the [[Howlett Estate]] grounds with two playmates that lived at the estate with him: [[Rose O'Hara (Earth-616)|Rose O'Hara]], a red-headed Irish girl who was brought in from town to be a companion to young James, and a boy nicknamed [[Dog Logan (Earth-616)|"Dog"]], Thomas Logan's son (and James's half-brother). The children were close friends, but, as they reached adolescence, the abuse inflicted upon Dog warped his mind. Dog made unwanted advances towards Rose, which James reported to his father. In retaliation, Dog killed James' puppy, leading to the expulsion of Thomas and Dog from the estate.

Thomas, in a drunken stupor and armed with a shotgun, invaded the Howlett Estate with his son and attempted to take his former lover Elizabeth with him. John, Sr. attempted to stop him and Thomas shot him in the head, in cold blood. James had just entered the room when this occurred and his mutation finally manifested: bone claws extended from the backs of his hands and he attacked the intruders with uncharacteristic ferocity, killing Thomas and scarring Dog's face with three claw marks.{{r|Wolverine: The Origin #2}} Already an emotionally disturbed woman since the death of her first son, Elizabeth, completely unhinged, drove James away and took her life immediately afterward with a blast from Thomas' gun.

[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616) from Wolverine The Origin Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|left|Claws pop for the first time.]]
James with Rose's help decided to flee the mansion after Dog told the police that Rose was the one who killed John and Elizabeth Howlett, the duo decided to ask for the help of James' grandfather who gave them some money and told them to run away. The duo then found themselves in the [[Yukon]] Territories in Canada, taking refuge in a [[British Columbia]] stone quarry, under the guise of being cousins. James also assumed the name of "Logan," in order to hide his identity. Here, Logan would become one of the most respected men by the miners for his hard work and eventually gained the nickname “Wolverine.”

As time passed, Logan's powers grew; he became stronger, his healing factor slowly removed the traumatic memories of his childhood, he accepted his feral nature and he started to hunt with a pack of wolves. During this period, Logan developed strong feelings for Rose, but could not act on them for the sake of their guise as cousins. [[Brendan Smith (Earth-616)|Smitty]], who had been mentoring Logan all these years, had also grown close to Rose and the two eventually fell in love and became engaged, much to the scorn and surprise of Logan, who later accepted the situation for the sake of Rose's happiness.

[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616) from Wolverine The Origin Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|left|Logan leading a pack of wolves.]]
But as Logan accepted Rose's decision and made sure that both her and Smitty could leave the mine and live a peaceful life, someone from Logan's past came back looking for revenge: Dog. Dog attacked Logan and started to beat him up in front of Rose but in the midst of the fight, Logan finally remembered who Dog was and what happened on the night his father was killed. He then defeated Dog and was about to kill him with his claws, Rose tried to stop Logan but she accidentally fell and was impaled on his claws which killed her. Shocked by what happened, Logan's mind shut down and he decided to abandon the civilized world and lived with the wolves.{{r|Wolverine: The Origin #6}}

In the years that followed, Logan was tracked by Dog once again,{{r|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #4}} he encountered [[Death (Earth-616)|Death itself]],{{r|Marvel's Voices #1}} he then met [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Nathaniel Essex]] who was obsessed with mutations{{r|Origin II #3}} and [[Clara Creed (Earth-616)|several]] [[Saul Creed (Earth-616)|(Earth-616)/Members]] of the Creed family{{r|Origin II #3}} before finally coming back to the civilization.{{r|Origin II #5}}

Not long after Logan met for the first time [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Victor Creed]] who wanted revenge for what Logan did to his family, Victor captured him and sent him to the [[Ravencroft Institute]] where he was tortured and experimented on by Nathaniel Essex once again but thanks to the help of [[Claudia Russell (Earth-616)|one the doctors]], Logan was able to escape.{{r|Ruins of Ravencroft: Sabretooth #1}}

It was supposedly around this time that [[Romulus (Earth-616)|Romulus]], a supposed immortal being who used and manipulated the members of the Hudson line (Logan's mother's family) for decades, decided to take an interest in Logan.

===The Death of Silver Fox===
[[File:Wolverine Vol 2 10 page 00 Victor Creed (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|left|Logan facing Victor Creed after the death of Silver Fox.]]
Later, Logan, apparently under Romulus' guidance, traveled to [[Japan]] and [[Madripoor]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 55}} where he met for the first time [[Seraph (Earth-616)|Seraph]] (who was working for Romulus),{{r|Wolverine: Origins Annual #1}} the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]], and faced once again Victor Creed, now calling himself Sabretooth, who was also working for Romulus.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 53}}

At some point later, Logan traveled to another frontier community in the [[Canadian Rockies]] and met a young Blackfoot Indian woman, named [[Silver Fox (Canadian) (Earth-616)|Silver Fox]], with whom he fell in love.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 125}} The two shared a cabin together and lived happily for a time. On Logan's birthday, Sabretooth, supposedly under Romulus' orders, brutally attacked Silver Fox, raping her and leaving her for dead, the first of many birthday "surprises" from him to come. Enraged, Logan battled him in a bar, only to be defeated and almost killed.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 10}} Sabretooth then manipulated a feral, mindless Logan into believing the people of a nearby town had ordered Silver Fox's death, prompting Logan to slaughter the inhabitants of the town and falling under Romulus' control.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #5}}

===The Immortal Warrior===
[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616) from Logan Vol 1 2.jpg|thumb|left|Logan surviving the Hiroshima bombing.]]
In the years that followed Silver Fox's death, Logan traveled all around the world, he became a soldier, a mercenary, an assassin, and outlaw, a spy, and a samurai, fighting in many wars. He met his master and father figure [[Ogun (Ninja) (Earth-616)|Lord Ogun]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 113}} and fought with or against (or both) individuals such as [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Natalia Romanoff]] whom he trained in martial arts,{{r|Wolverine: Origins #9}} the vampire hunter [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Eric Brooks]],{{r|Blade Vol 4 5}} fellow mercenary [[Eugene Judd (Earth-616)|Eugene Judd]],{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 17}} [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky Barnes]],{{r|Wolverine: Origins #17}} [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]],{{r|Wolverine: Origins #17}} and [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #268}} Logan also met several that would became some of his fiercest enemies, such as [[Silas Burr (Earth-616)|Cyber]],{{r|Wolverine: Origins #17}} [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 62}} [[Frank Simpson (Earth-616)|Nuke]],{{r|Wolverine: Origins #3}} and [[Bloodscream (Earth-616)|Bloodscream]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 78}}

After the end of [[World War II]], Logan, under Ogun's advice, sought redemption for his past actions in [[Jasmine Falls]], Japan, where he studied with [[Bando Saburo (Earth-616)|Bando Saburo]], in order to learn how to be a man and to leave his warrior nature behind.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 40}} Here he fell in love with a local woman named [[Itsu (Earth-616)|Itsu]]. They married and conceived a [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|child]] together which filled Logan with joy,{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 40}} but Itsu was murdered by the now brainwashed Bucky Barnes, a.k.a the Winter Soldier, under Romulus' orders.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 40}}

Believing that both his wife and child were dead, Logan disappeared. To avenge their deaths he went to see an immortal swordsmith named [[Muramasa (Earth-616)|Muramasa]], who used a piece of Logan's soul to forge a mighty blade that Logan would claim years later.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 40}} Logan was then retrieved by Romulus' organization and brainwashed once again, but unknown to him, Romulus also took the child from Itsu's womb and he was safely born and adopted by a Japanese couple. This child was named Akihiro, but he eventually took the name "Daken," meaning "Mongrel."{{r|Wolverine: Origins #26|27}}

===[[Team X (Earth-616)|Team X]]===
[[File:Team X (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|left|Victor Creed, John Wraith, David North and Logan as part of Team X.]]
By 1961, Logan, known as Wolverine now, joined the [[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X Project]], part of the [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus Program]], which had been created to fight the mutant menace. He was then placed on the Black Ops squad run by the CIA, called [[Team X (Earth-616)|Team X]], with Sabretooth, Silver Fox (who surprisingly appeared to be alive and with no memories of her time with Logan), [[Christoph Nord (Earth-616)|Maverick]], [[John Wraith (Earth-616)|Kestrel]], and [[Mastodon (Elefante) (Earth-616)|Mastodon]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 49}} During this time, Logan and the others received memory implants via staged scenarios, telepathic manipulation by [[Aldo Ferro (Earth-616)|Aldo Ferro]], and other technology.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 63}} Weapon X also duplicated Wolverine's healing factor and implanted it in Team X, slowing their aging processes.

In 1966, Logan also helped Nick Fury deal with the [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|Sym-Soldiers]] in [[Vietnam]] where he discovered the existence of alien life and was possessed for the first time by a [[Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|symbiote]].{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam #1}}

In early 1968,<ref>It has to be noted that according to {{cl|Wolverine: Origins #6}} and {{cl|Wolverine: Origins #7}}, Logan being shot with Carbonadium bullets and the Berlin mission happened in 1963, which contradicted several past stories; however, {{cl|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}, {{cl|Wolverine Saga Vol 2 1}}, and {{cl|History of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 2}}, which were released after {{cl|Wolverine: Origins # 6}} & {{cl|Wolverine: Origins #7}}, re-established that Logan being shot with Carbonadium bullets and quitting Team X happened in early and late 1968, though all these dates should be considered topical references due to the [[Glossary:Sliding Timescale|sliding timescale]].</ref> Wolverine was called to report in a facility located in Dallas, Texas, where he was shot with [[Carbonadium]] bullets, which slowed his healing factor so that Weapon X or Romulus could know how to kill him.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #6}} The bullets were removed but Logan awoke earlier than expected, and he regained his memories for the first time in years, because they hadn't been altered yet.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #7}} Logan tried to keep the secret,and he rendezvoused with Team X in [[Berlin]], [[Germany|East Germany]] where the team was sent to steal the [[Carbonadium Synthesizer]] in order to sabotage the Russian Super Soldier program and save [[Janice Hollenbeck (Earth-616)|Janice Hollenbeck]], a double agent. After retrieving the device, the team was attacked by the product of this new Russian Super Soldier program, [[Arkady Rossovich (Earth-616)|Omega Red]]. During the team's escape, Sabretooth, apparently aware that Wolverine had regained his memories, killed Janice to reinforce Wolverine's conditioning about innocents dying when he overstepped Romulus' boundaries.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #8}} In the end, Team X was able to escape from Omega Red but it seemed the Carbonadium Synthesizer was lost.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 5}}-[[X-Men Vol 2 6|6]]}} In truth, Wolverine was still in possession of the Carbonadium Synthesizer and decided to hide it from the rest of the team. After this event, Logan quit Team X in late 1968.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 7}}{{r|History of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 2}}

===Logan's Women and the Mongrels===
During all those years, Logan met and fell in love with many women and unknown to him, he also fathered a number of children. Those children would be found later on by another of Logan's sons, Daken, who would give them to an evil organization who wanted revenge on Logan for what he did to them in the past: [[Red Right Hand (Earth-616)|the Red Right Hand]]. On Daken's advice, the Red Right Hand trained them in order to use them as weapons against Logan, but knowing perfectly that they wouldn't stand a chance against him. They would be known as the [[Mongrels (Earth-616)|Mongrels]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 14}}

===[[Department K (Earth-616)|Department K]]===
After he quit Team X, Wolverine joined [[Department K (Earth-616)|Department K]], a secret Canadian Defense Ministry branch with ties to Weapon X. Based in [[Ottawa]], he partnered with [[Neil Langram (Earth-616)|Neil Langram]] and worked again with Nick Fury, now a high-ranking CIA agent, and with [[Richard Parker (Earth-616)|Richard]] and [[Mary Parker (Earth-616)|Mary Parker]] (the parents of Peter Parker a.k.a the Amazing Spider-Man).{{r|Untold Tales of Spider-Man #-1}}

[[File: James Howlett (Earth-616) from Wolverine Annual Vol 1 1997 001.jpg|thumb|left|Secret Agent Logan.]]
Years later, Langram was sought as an operative by the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]], but he refused, and was then slain by Sabretooth, hired as a mercenary. Wolverine and [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol Danvers]], a young US spy, investigated and infiltrated the Canadian Ministry of Defense, and more precisely a top secret research and development agency which was in its early stage of growth, hidden in a sub-basement of a vast government complex: [[Department H (Earth-616)| Department H]]. Within they discovered a list of several names called "The Mutant Agenda," and more troubling the names of both Logan and his dead partner Neil were on it.

Logan and Carol then decided to track [[Perry Edwards (Earth-616)|Dr. Perry Edwards]], who wrote a book about the rise of superhumans and whose name was at the top of the list. The duo found him in New York and were able to save him from an assassination attempt, they then told him what they had found. He wasn't surprised and explained to them that he discovered the existence of genetically superior beings who were living amongst them: Mutants. But more importantly he also discovered that some of those mutants weren't benevolent and were planning to kill all the members of the inner circle of the Hellfire Club in their search for power, but to that end they needed to keep the existence of mutantkind a secret.{{r|Logan: Shadow Society #1}}

After infiltrating the Hellfire Club in order to learn more, Logan and Carol were lured by [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]] and Sabretooth to a Canadian Hellfire Club facility where Sabretooth confronted them. After discovering that Sabretooth killed Perry Edwards and several government officials to make sure the existence of mutantkind couldn't be revealed to the public, Sabretooth told Wolverine details of the Club's intent to guide a war between mutants and humans. Sabretooth tried to kill Logan, and during their fight he told Logan that it was time for him to admit the truth: he was a mutant just like him and that was why he was so obsessed with mutants.{{r|Logan: Shadow Society #1}}

Logan, realizing that Sabretooth was the one who had killed Langram, proceeded to defeat his foe by stabbing him with his sword. Despite the severe injury, Sabretooth wasn't done and he decided to bomb the facility, but Logan and Carol were able to escape in time. Sabretooth survived and also escaped later on. After this adventure, Logan and Carol parted ways, but after he started to talk about this conspiracy with the Ministry of Defense and after bursting in both Department H and the Hellfire Club during this adventure, Logan's reputation was now dirt in his country. As a result, he tried to forget about the mutant problem and decided to go to the Yukon.{{r|Logan: Shadow Society #1}}

But Logan was still troubled by Sabretooth's revelations, and he started to develop a morbid preoccupation with the current "mutant" scandals.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #72}} To make things worse, Logan's natural mutation started to take its toll on his mind around that time, giving him nightmares and visions every night to the point of turning him crazy and feral.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 91}} As a result, Logan started to abuse drugs and he became an alcoholic. This self-destructive behavior led Logan to accidentally shoot a fellow agent at a firing range one day and as a result he was dismissed from Department K and decided to leave Canada.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #72}}


===The Weapon X Experiment===
[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616) being prepped for adamantium bonding process from Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 73 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Logan prepped for the adamantium bonding process.]]
At some point,{{r|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus #1}} before leaving Canada, while in his Lotus Seven, Logan was pumped full of Thorazine, beaten, and kidnapped by a group of armed men from the Weapon X Project, possibly under Romulus' orders.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 73}} The man known only as the [[Truett Hudson (Earth-616)|Professor]], [[Abraham Cornelius (Earth-616)|Dr. Abraham Cornelius]], and [[Carol Hines (Earth-616)|Dr. Carol Hines]] then began to examine Logan while he floated in a containment tank. Logan's skeleton, including his claws, was bonded with the indestructible metal known as [[Adamantium]], making it unbreakable, and burying his personality beneath the most intense brainwashing he had ever undergone.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #73|74}}

[[File:Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 75 page - James Howlett (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|right|Weapon X breaks free.]]
Logan was then put under deep hypnosis, telling him that he was not a man or individual, and being a man disgusted him.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #75}} Reduced to a near-mindless state, Logan was apparently forced by Weapon X to slaughter every inhabitant of the small town of [[Roanoke (Alberta)|Roanoke]] as a test.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 24}}
Logan proved to be too difficult for the Weapon X Program to control and, after some time, he broke free of the programming, fell into a berserker fury and escaped the facility, killing nearly everyone except for the Professor, Dr. Cornelius, Dr. Hines, and [[Malcolm Colcord (Earth-616)|Malcolm Colcord]], who later became the Director of a new Weapon X Program.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #84}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 166}} 

Unknown to Logan at the time, the Winter Soldier was apparently present and helped him escape from his captors.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 38}}

As a result of having his bones and claws laced with the adamantium, Wolverine's natural mutation which was slowly turning him feral was put into remission as the adamantium precipitated a chemical change within his body.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 91}} As a result of this experiment impeding his natural evolution, Wolverine's healing factor was weakened and he healed slower than before.

===Facing the Hulk and Joining the X-Men===
[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616) from Alpha Flight Vol 2 -1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|A feral Logan attacking James and Heather Hudson.]]
Wandering in the woods, Logan was eventually discovered by [[Heather McNeil (Earth-616)|Heather]] and [[James Hudson, Jr. (Earth-616)|James "Mac" Hudson]], a young couple honeymooning in the Rockies, whom he attacked, only to be shot by James. While he was recovering, Logan regained enough of his human persona to be horrified at his claws, believing them to be artificial implants.{{r|Alpha Flight #33}} After recovering his mental faculties with the Hudson's help, Logan became a member of Canada's [[Department H (Earth-616)|Department H]] the superhuman-oriented government agency James Hudson founded.{{r|Alpha Flight #33}}

Some time after, the Canadian military mobilized to fight the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], but Wolverine received orders from Romulus to attract an unidentified party's attention by fighting the Hulk. Wolverine started a battle with the Hulk and a [[Paul Cartier (Earth-616)|Wendigo]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #180}}

[[File:Incredible Hulk Vol 1 180 page - James Howlett (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine introducing himself to both Hulk and the Wendigo during his first cameo appearance.]]
Wolverine's speed and maneuverability proved to be a match for the two plodding powerhouses, but after realizing Hulk was a more formidable opponent, he changed tactics. Teaming up with Hulk to take out the Wendigo, Hulk threw the Wendigo into a patch of trees and Wolverine delivered the finishing blow. The Hulk and Wolverine kept on fighting, and as Hulk had by now grown so enraged that Wolverine's adamantium claws failed to penetrate his skin, he finally managed to temporarily knock Wolverine out.{{r|Incredible Hulk #181}} Quickly back on his feet and despite his protests to keep fighting the Hulk, Wolverine was ordered to return to Department H while the Hulk was knocked out with a gas bomb and captured.{{r|Incredible Hulk #182}}

Wolverine then spent months completing some espionage missions until he was approached by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]], attracted by Logan's fight with the Hulk (as Romulus expected) and looking for mutants to help his students, the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], escape from the island-being known as [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. Wolverine resigned from Department H to accompany Professor Xavier and rescue the captured X-Men.{{r|Giant-Size X-Men #1}}

[[File:Incredible Hulk Vol 1 181.jpg|thumb|left|The first full appearance of Wolverine.]]
Shortly after, Wolverine, under Romulus' instructions, tried to assassinate Xavier, but Charles broke Romulus' hold on Wolverine by blocking the effects of his programming. After Krakoa was defeated, Wolverine decided to stay with the X-Men, at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|School for Gifted Youngsters]], with fellow new recruits [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], [[John Proudstar (Earth-616)|Thunderbird]], and [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], as the original members left to pursue normal lives.{{r|X-Men #94}}

Logan remained with the X-Men for quite some time, but a rivalry grew between him and [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], one of the reasons being that he had fallen for Scott's girlfriend, telekinetic telepath [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], who soon rejoined the group.{{r|Classic X-Men #1}} Despite being at first skeptical of Xavier's hope for mutant and human coexistence, Wolverine began to respect his ideals, determination, and goals, growing into a loyal and trusted member of the X-Men. Wolverine also developed strong friendships with Kurt Wagner, Peter Rasputin, and Ororo Munroe.

===Meeting Mariko===
When the X-Men traveled to [[Agarashima]], Japan, Logan met [[Mariko Yashida (Earth-616)|Lady Mariko Yashida]] and aided her cousin, former X-Man [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]], in battling [[Moses Magnum (Earth-616)|Moses Magnum]]. Although she was unable to reciprocate his feelings, Wolverine fell for Lady Mariko, heir to an extremely powerful [[Yakuza (Earth-616)|Yakuza]] [[Clan Yashida (Earth-616)|family]] in [[Tokyo]]. Initially frightened, Mariko was soon set at ease by Wolverine, who was attracted to her gentle demeanor, and both fell in love.{{r|X-Men #118}}

[[File:Mariko Yashida (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Wolverine 2004 Vol 1 11.jpg|thumb|right|Mariko Yashida.]]
After he made the first change to his costume and journeyed to Canada to make things right with Alpha Flight and Department H,{{r|X-Men #139|140}} Logan started to investigate the return of his letters to Mariko and discovered that she had been married to an abusive husband, [[Noburu-Hideki (Earth-616)|Noburu Hideki]]. Logan intended to kill her husband, but was drugged and challenged to a duel of wooden swords by Mariko's father, [[Shingen Harada (Earth-616)|Lord Shingen]]. During the duel, Logan was soundly beaten and humiliated in front of Mariko, due to the poisoning and Shingen using deadly pressure points. Logan then threw the sword and unsheathed his claws, only to be beaten more and revered as an "animal cast in a semblance of human form" for using deadly force in a non-lethal duel. With this act, Logan had dishonored himself to Mariko and was cast into the streets, where he was rescued by [[Yukio (Earth-616)|Yukio]], later his close friend and sometimes lover. After being attacked by the Hand, Yukio manipulated Logan into helping her, which led to further embarrassment in front of Mariko.

[[File:Wolverine Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|left|The first Wolverine limited series.]]
Upon realizing his deceit, Logan took the fight directly to Shingen. After Yukio killed Mariko's husband, Wolverine was forced to kill Lady Mariko's father, Lord Shingen, in a duel. Afterward, Mariko gave Logan the Clan Yashida Masamune sword, stating he was worthy. Forged 800 years ago by the supreme swordsmith Masamune, the sacred blade represented everything that was best and most noble in the family and the samurai, the lord's champion, who wielded it. With the deaths of her father and husband, Mariko was named head of Clan Yashida. Logan stayed with her, and they later announced their engagement.{{r|Wolverine #4}}

Before the wedding service, [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]] and Mariko's half-brother [[Keniuchio Harada (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]] poisoned the X-Men and battled Logan to wrest control of the Clan Yashida from Mariko. At first enraged at seeing [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] had joined the X-Men, she gained Logan's respect after saving the life of Mariko by jumping in front of a shot from Viper intended for her. Mariko and Logan became estranged, due to the honor customs of her family, as well as the manipulations of the villain [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Mastermind]], and Logan returned the Masamune sword to her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #175}} After the X-Men defeated Mastermind, Mariko returned the honor sword to him and stated that she had to break her Clan's criminal connections. Mariko felt that she could not marry Wolverine until she did this.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #176}}

===Meeting Amiko, Training Shadowcat and Facing Ogun===
[[File:Amiko Kobayashi (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 181 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Logan witnessing the death of Amiko's mother.]]
Weeks later, the X-Men battled a giant dragon when they were teleported to Japan. Unable to save a dying woman, Wolverine vowed to protect her daughter, [[Amiko Kobayashi (Earth-616)|Amiko Kobayashi]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #181}} Logan initially left Amiko in the care of Mariko while the X-Men next battled [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #184}} Amiko would eventually become Wolverine's foster daughter.{{r|Kitty Pryde and Wolverine #5}}

Following a distress call from teammate [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]], Wolverine traveled to Japan.{{r|Kitty Pryde and Wolverine #1}} Kitty was then captured and put under the mental control of Ogun. Ogun mentally controlled her, transforming her body and soul as he had originally intended to do to Wolverine.{{r|Kitty Pryde and Wolverine #2}} After arriving in Japan, Kitty was sent to kill Wolverine and injured him greatly,{{r|Kitty Pryde and Wolverine #3}} but with help from Yukio, she was restored.

[[File:Kitty Pryde and Wolverine Vol 1 4.jpg|thumb|left|Logan training Shadowcat.]]
Logan undertook a crash program in order to teach Kitty's body, just as Ogun had taught her mind, to become skillful enough in the Japanese martial arts to contend against Ogun and to help her overcome his evil.{{r|Kitty Pryde and Wolverine #4}} Kitty went to face Ogun herself, who was attempting to kill Mariko and Amiko to punish Wolverine. After being defeated by Ogun, he offered Kitty, calling herself Shadowcat, to join him or die. At that time, Wolverine came to her rescue.{{r|Kitty Pryde and Wolverine #5}} Sadly, Wolverine was also overwhelmed and the two of them sat helplessly at Ogun's mercy. In a turn of events, Kitty informed Wolverine that she was scared until he arrived and when he apologized, she stated that she did not want an apology, but life. At that moment, Wolverine turned the battle and defeated Ogun and Kitty regained her innocence that Ogun had taken. After killing Ogun, although his spirit survived, Logan and Kitty became very close friends, with her as a near-foster daughter to him.{{r|Kitty Pryde and Wolverine #6}}

It was during this adventure that Logan learned from Charles Xavier that his friend James "Mac" Hudson died.{{r|Kitty Pryde and Wolverine #4}} After Ogun was defeated, Logan decided to head back to Canada and check on Heather Hudson in order to support her in her ordeal.{{r|Alpha Flight #16|17}}

===Lady Deathstrike and Sabretooth===
Some time after, [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Yuriko Oyama a.k.a Lady Deathstrike]] tracked Logan, intending to kill him. Her father [[Kenji Oyama (Earth-616)|Lord Dark Wind]] invented the process that laced Logan's skeleton with adamantium but his work was stolen, and as a result she wanted Logan to return what she thought he had stolen from her father: his adamantium skeleton.{{r|Alpha Flight #34}} After being defeated a first time, Yuriko swore to defeat Wolverine and avenge both her honor and the honor of her father, to that end she went to see [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]] to be augmented into a cyborg with superhuman strength and Adamantium claws. Three former Hellfire Club soldiers that were severely injured by Wolverine when he saved the X-Men from the Hellfire Club also swore revenge on Logan, and as a result they were also changed into cyborgs and became [[Reavers (Earth-616)|the Reavers]]. Lady Deathstrike and her Reavers attacked Wolverine and almost killed him. Logan was aided by [[Katherine Power (Earth-616)|Katie Power]] and with her help he was able to recover from his wounds and defeat the Reavers. Logan then confronted Lady Deathstrike and after a violent battle he defeated her and was horrified to discover what Yuriko did to herself in order have her revenge against him. Despite Yuriko begging Logan to kill her out of mercy, he refused and told her she had to earn it.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #205}}

[[File: Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616) Old Man Logan Vol 2 5 001.jpg|thumb|right|Lady Deathstrike.]]
Soon after, another ghost from Logan's past appeared once again: Sabretooth. When the X-Men attempted to rescue the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] after the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] began to indiscriminately massacre them, Wolverine was charged with bringing one of the Marauder as a prisoner.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #211}} While hunting the Marauders, Logan was confronted by Sabretooth who was about to kill the [[Healer (Morlock) (Earth-616)|Healer]]. Despite wanting to fight Sabretooth and kill him as a revenge for everything he did to him in the past, Logan decided that saving Healer was more important than his feud with his old foe. As a result Logan managed to trap Sabretooth under a pile of rubble and helped the Healer get to safety.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #212}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 213.jpg|thumb|left|Wolverine facing Sabretooth during [[Mutant Massacre]].]]
Unfortunately for Wolverine, Sabretooth wasn't done with him. After the evacuation of all the surviving Morlocks from their tunnels, Sabretooth snuck inside the X-Mansion, knocked out Rogue, and tried to kill the X-Men newest recruit: [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)| Elizabeth "Betsy" Braddock]]. Betsy was able to handle her own for a while despite Sabretooth's ferocious attacks until the X-Men finally arrived at the mansion. Wolverine then decided to confront Sabretooth while Psylocke used the opportunity to probe Sabretooth's mind in order to learn the identity of the Marauders' leader.

Despite Sabretooth's psy-shields, Betsy succeeded, and after letting Logan and the X-Men know, the team decided to help Wolverine against his foe. Sabretooth, knowing that he was going to lose against both Wolverine and the rest of the X-Men, decided to dive into the lake near the Mansion, with Wolverine following after him. But in the end, Sabretooth managed to escape and not even Psylocke could detect him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #213}}

===Crystal of Ultimate Vision===
[[File:Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 1 11.jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine and Storm vs. Horde.]]
On the anniversary of his wedding to Mariko, the team was abducted by [[Horde (Earth-616)|Horde]] who wanted to use them as his lackeys in order to retrieve the Crystal of Ultimate Vision, of which he wore a shard on his forehead. The X-Men were sent to the [[Citadel of Light and Shadow]] where the crystal was hidden. As the X-Men progressed through it, the citadel created illusions of each of their most powerful desires. Only Wolverine, Storm, and Psylocke were able to resist. Wolverine reached the Crystal but Horde cut him down and killed him by removing his heart that he wanted to keep as a trophy. However, a lone drop of Logan's blood splattered on the Crystal, which gave out enough energy for Wolverine to be restored and reborn. Empowered to godhood, Wolverine plucked the crystal shard from Horde's forehead and the tyrant quickly aged and crumbled to dust within seconds. Wolverine rejected the godlike power and returned the X-Men and their friends home, ensuring that the human race would be able to evolve to its full potential.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 11}}

===Wolverine vs. Spider-Man===
After the deaths of ex-[[Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (Earth-616)|KGB]] agents all over [[Manhattan]], Logan was reminded of an old freelance operative from the Cold War, [[Charlemagne (Agent) (Earth-616)|Charlemagne]]. The last time Logan had seen Charlie, she was working in West [[Berlin]]. It was a mission that Logan had protested, but Charlie insisted and her handler double-crossed her. Charlie called for Logan's help and he understood that it was serious. After fifty Soviet operatives couldn't take them down, they sent in KGB agents that had been undercover for years and Wolverine's berserker rage finished them all. After the slaughter, all that was left was a little heart-shaped pendant. After leaving the X-Men in a time of need, Logan traveled to Potsdamer Platz, West Berlin, where two KGB agents blew their cover by killing muggers and Charlemagne killed them while Logan's back was turned.{{r|Spider-Man Versus Wolverine #1}}

[[File:Charlemagne (Agent) (Earth-616), James Howlett (Earth-616) and Peter Parker (Earth-616) from Spider-Man Versus Wolverine Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|Wolverine facing Spider-Man.]]
While in [[Kurfürstendamm]], Logan got the scent of Spider-Man in civilian clothing and discerning his secret identity. Logan warned Spider-Man to stay away from Berlin and forget about Charlemagne, but when Spider-Man returned to his hotel, KGB agents killed [[Edward Leeds (Earth-616)|Ned Leeds]] and were asking his involvement when Logan arrived and killed all of the agents, again warning Spider-Man to leave. Logan tracked Charlie to a steel mill just outside of East Berlin and the two stayed together for a while. When the couple went to dinner at The Ganymed on Friedrich Strasse, Spider-Man arrived to inform them that everyone in the restaurant was an agent wanting to kill Charlie, a fact that Charlemagne and Wolverine already knew, and a gunfight broke out. After losing Charlie in the fight, Wolverine and Spider-Man attempted to track her down by getting to her marks before she did, but were always one step behind. After the pair split, Charlemagne called Wolverine to a Soviet cemetery at [[Treptow]] and he understood that she wanted him to end her life, so that the Soviets wouldn't have the chance to torture her.

After flinching, Wolverine pulled too much and Charlemagne was bleeding to death. At that time, Spider-Man arrived and attempted to stop Logan from killing her. A brutal fight broke out between the two. While on top of Spider-Man, Wolverine stated Spider-Man would have to use all of his strength to break Wolverine's neck, while he would just have to lash out his claws to kill Spider-Man. At that time, a government chopper arrived and the two split. In the confusion, Charlemagne snuck up on Spider-Man, aware that he was tense, and he gave a punch of super strength, killing her. Charlie died in Wolverine's arms and the agents left. After giving Spider-Man a fake passport, the pair returned home.{{r|Spider-Man Versus Wolverine #1}}

===Patch===
After the X-Men were believed to be dead to the eyes of the world and relocated to [[Australia]], Logan found [[David Chapel (Earth-616)|Dave Chapel]] in the desert tortured and dying from exposure, To investigate this matter, Wolverine returned to Madripoor, to the [[Princess Bar]], and saved [[O'Donnell (Madripoor) (Earth-616)|O'Donnell]] from thugs of the crime boss [[Roche (Earth-616)|Roche]], while searching for "the Tiger."{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #1}} While at the bar, Logan realized that he was being watched and confronted the woman, who turned-out to be [[Jessán Hoan (Earth-616)|Jessán Hoan]].{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #2}} After a brief battle with Jessán, Wolverine was beaten by [[Sapphire Styx (Earth-616)|Sapphire Styx]] and [[Douglas Scott (Earth-616)|Razor-Fist]] and delivered to Roche.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #3}} After surviving torture from [[Inquisitor (Vestry) (Earth-616)|Inquisitor]], Wolverine escaped and was brutally attacked by Razor-Fist, who stabbed him in his throat and torso and left him for dead.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #4}} Wolverine was rescued from a harbor and looked after by Jessán.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #5}} After healing, Wolverine began wearing an eye patch to keep the resurrection of the X-Men a secret. After he learned that Jessán was in fact Tyger Tiger, Logan vowed to aid her in overthrowing Roche and taking his place as Madripoor's crime lord.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #6|7}} After defeating Razor-Fist, Wolverine and Tyger Tiger rescued O'Donnell, killed Roche, and Wolverine declared that he would become Tyger's conscience to remind her that if she became like Roche, he would come for her. After stating that he did not like crime lords, he let Tyger Tiger choose her own path. Tyger responded that he had won her heart and the two kissed.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #8|10}}

[[File:Wolverine Vol 2 31 page - James Howlett (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|right|Logan as Patch.]]
Shortly after following the scents of suspects for a murder case, Logan (posing as Patch) ran into [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]], of the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]], working for her uncle who was attempting to overthrow Tyger Tiger, and made an uneasy ally with [[Tai (Madripoor) (Earth-616)|Police Chief Tai]]. After informing Tyger that he would not assassinate or kidnap for her, Patch and Tyger were beaten by [[Roughhouse (Earth-616)|Roughhouse]] and [[Bloodscream (Earth-616)|Bloodsport]] and rescued by Karma.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 4}} Patch left Tyger with Jessica, Lindsay, and [[Chang (Madripoor) (Earth-616)|Chang]] (who was killed by Roughhouse and Bloodsport) while he destroyed [[Nguyen Ngoc Coy (Earth-616)|General Nguyen Ngoc Coy]]'s opium supplies, where he encountered the [[Harriers (Earth-616)|Harriers]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 5}}

After disrupting Coy's drug activities, Patch took the fight directly to Coy, battling and defeating Roughhouse and Bloodsport to rescue Lindsay, Jessica, and Tyger. Patch had General Coy at his mercy, until [[Prince Baran (Earth-616)|Prince Baran]] intervened and,{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 6}} thanks to Lindsay, considered them all honored guests of his. The Prince offered that Tyger and General Coy work together to avoid either a power vacuum or warzone in Madripoor's underground, and Patch convinced Tyger to accept.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 7}}

[[File:Wolverine Vol 2 1.jpg|thumb|left|The first issue of the Wolverine ongoing series.]]
Next, Patch began his quest to save Karma from her uncle's service, but was sidetracked when he learned that disrupting General Coy's drug activities planted a target on the General's head, and Karma needed him to help her find her missing [[Leong Coy Manh (Earth-616)|brother]] and [[Nga Coy Manh (Earth-616)|sister]]. Patch accompanied Xi'an Coy Manh to the airport to witness the arrival of Joe Fixit, who Patch smelled right away and recognized as the Hulk.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 7}} Patch went-on to use Joe to disrupt General Coy's drug and slave operations.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 8}} Later, Police Chief Tai informed Patch that he was aware the Patch and Wolverine were one and the same. Remembering his first "birthday gift" of severe beatings from Sabretooth, Patch saved a couple from being mugged and was later targeted by the thugs. After escaping an attempted hit, Patch tracked them to the Princess Bar only to find them dead and a note from Creed reading "Nobody kills you but me - especially today."{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 10}}

===Meeting Jubilee===
Logan continued to juggle between his life with the X-Men in Australia and his solo adventures in Madripoor for a while, but one day after returning from Madripoor Logan was attacked and captured by the Reavers and [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]] who decided to hang him on a cross and torture him. While on the cross, Logan had several fever dreams during which he saw several of his friends and foes, but also a vision of what was happening to the X-Men, thanks to [[Gateway (Earth-616)|Gateway]]. Logan learned that without him and after [[Longshot (Mojoverse)|Longshot]] quit the team, the X-Men were weakened and Pierce and the Reavers intended to kill them at their lowest. Psylocke knew the X-Men had no chance against the imminent attack, so she telepathically convinced her teammates to enter the [[Siege Perilous]] in order to save them. The X-Men gone, Pierce was left more furious than ever and decided to take out his anger on Logan.

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 251.jpg|thumb|right|Logan crucified.]]
After Gateway showed him what happened, Logan was then confronted again by Pierce who decided to crucify him on a X-shaped cross, shortly after a powerful storm started which forced the Reavers to leave Logan alone. In the middle of the storm, a young runaway mutant named [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]], who had secretly followed and lived with the X-Men for a while after they saved her from the [[M-Squad (Earth-616)|M-Squad]], witnessed what was happening to Logan from afar and decided to help him despite the fear of being caught and killed by the Reavers. As she approached, Logan managed to free himself and fell to the ground. Jubilee both amazed and afraid by what she saw, helped him get back on his feet.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #251}}

[[File:Jubilation Lee (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 244 002.png|thumb|left|Jubilee]]
Jubilee hid the wounded Logan who had trouble healing and hallucinated Carol Danvers and Nick Fury. Disoriented, Logan attacked Jubilee, but she managed to knock him back with her plasma blast and he regained sense. Pierce, angry that Wolverine escaped, sent his hounds in order to track him down, but thanks to Gateway both Logan and Jubilee managed to defeat the Reavers and escape.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #252}}

Despite being part of the Reavers, Lady Deathstrike respected Logan as a warrior, so she decided to protect the Yashida's honor sword that Logan kept in his room from the other Reavers and let him escape with Jubilee because there was no honor in killing him if he couldn't defend himself.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #252}} Logan and Jubilee then decided to head to [[Hong Kong]] and more precisely to the [[Landau, Luckman & Lake (Earth-616)|Landau, Luckman & Lake]] Office in order to investigate the disappearance of the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #258}}

After this adventure, Jubilee followed Logan on several adventures and would eventually became like a daughter to him, much like Kitty before. With the help of Jubilee and later Psylocke, Logan was able to find the missing X-Men,{{r|[[X-Tinction Agenda]]}} and after defeating the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] on [[Muir Island]],{{r|[[Muir Island Saga]]}} the team was finally united once again.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 1}}

===[[Shiva Scenario]]===
[[File:Wolverine Vol 2 48 page - James Howlett (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|right|Logan facing the ghosts of his past.]]
The search for the the X-Men now over, Wolverine was greatly troubled by some of his lost memories, so he decided to investigate the abandoned [[Weapon X Facility]] in Canada where he had been transformed years before. There, he started to have flashbacks of his time with Team X and from when he was abducted by the Weapon X program.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 48}}

After Logan learned that his memories had been tampered with, both Xavier and Jean tried to help him by removing some of his memory blocks, but as a result Logan was overwhelmed and almost lost his mind. Professor Xavier told him that if he tried to remove Logan's memory blocks again, Logan could lose his humanity. This revelation angered Logan and he tore off his brown costume, saying he wasn't an animal but an X-Man.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 49}} As a result Logan stopped wearing his brown costume and decided to wear his original blue and yellow uniform again.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 50}}

Logan headed to [[Windsor (Ontario)|Windsor]], Ontario and infiltrated an old Weapon X warehouse where some of his fake memories were created, inadvertently activating the artificial intelligence [[S.H.I.V.A. (Earth-616)|Shiva]] which was designed to kill rogue Team X members, including Wolverine. Logan managed to defeat the Shiva robot, but another one took his place, and Logan discovered that he couldn't defeat it the same way twice. Despite Shiva's adaptive nature, Logan still had the upper hand when the robot blasted him with a mind probe that made Logan relive every pain, injury, and moment of agony he had experienced in the past.

Unknown to Logan, the fight between him and Shiva was watched by both Carol Hines and Professor Thorton who appeared to still be alive, but shortly after Silver Fox revealed herself to both Hines and Thorton and she killed Thorton. Logan discovered that Thorton was dead and that Hines was still alive but also that before dying, Thorton activated all the remaining Shiva robots and that their main target was Sabretooth. While Logan didn't care about Sabretooth's fate, the X-Men worried about the other targets on the Shiva's kill list. Confronting the fact that many of his memories were implanted, Wolverine became much darker, which also worried the X-Men.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 50}}

===Omega Red===
[[File: X-Men Vol 2 5.jpg|thumb|left|Wolverine vs Omega Red.]]
After those revelations, Logan returned to the Mansion to spend more time with the X-Men, but unfortunately they were attacked by a ghost from Logan's past: [[Arkady Rossovich (Earth-616)|Omega Red]], who was recently resurrected by the leader of the Hand, [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba (Earth-616)|Matsu'o Tsurayaba]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 4}}

Omega Red, with the help of Abraham Cornelius and Matsu'o, was able to capture Logan who was then tortured in order to discover the location of the C-Synthesizer, the only thing that could stabilize Omega Red's powers. Fortunately, Logan was helped by another ghost from his past, his old teammate Maverick who discovered that Logan's memories of their time as part of Team X had been removed from his mind.

With the help of the X-Men and Maverick, Wolverine was able to stop Omega Red and Matsu'o plans, recovering the C-Synthesizer. After defeating Matsu'o army, Logan was confronted by Cornelius who was going to shoot him, but before that he apologized to Logan for what he did to him years ago. Logan, having no memory of the Weapon X experiment, didn't understand what Cornelius was talking about. Before he could get an answer, Cornelius was shot in the head by Maverick while Matsu'o and Omega Red managed to escape. Logan then gave the C-Synthesizer to Maverick telling him that despite the fact that he didn't remember everything about his past, he had a vague recollection that it must belong to him. Logan then disappeared and was left with more questions than answers about his own memories.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 7}}

===Mariko's Death===
After receiving a call from Jubilee, Logan quickly headed to Japan with [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] (to whom Logan owed money after a recent poker game), but unfortunately because of his adamantium skeleton he was stuck in [[Los Angeles]] airport security. After putting a call to S.H.I.E.L.D., Logan was able to go on the plane but his clearance request set off of Hydra's computers, so Silver Fox called in one of Donald Pierce's cyborgs, [[Cylla Markham (Earth-616)|Cylla]], to go after Logan and eliminated him. After landing in Japan, Wolverine and Gambit were attacked by and managed to defeat the Hand, but as a contingency plan Matsu'o Tsurayaba bailed Jubilee out of jail and kidnapped her.

[[File:Wolverine Vol 2 57.jpg|thumb|right|The Death of Mariko.]]
Jubilee met the assassin [[Reiko (Earth-616)|Reiko]] who had been blinded by the Hand and tasked with killing her. In exchange Reiko was promised her sight back, but after Jubilee mentioned that she knew Logan, Reiko let her go as she was indebted to Logan.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 55}}

Logan and Gambit finally arrived at the police station, but were attacked by Cylla and several ninjas sent by Matsu'o Tsurayaba. Thanks to the help of Sunfire, they were able to defeat them but Cylla managed to escape. Shortly after Jubilee was found by Yukio who took her to her place while Reiko was promised amnesty with the Hand by Silver Fox in exchange for her help.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 56}}

After the fight at the police station, Logan and Gambit headed to the house of the Yashida Family and discovered that the Clan Yashida was embroiled in an internal dispute. After Logan met Mariko and the Silver Samurai, the Hand attacked them, forcing the Silver Samurai, Gambit, and Logan to work together. Along the way Mariko gave Logan his old brown costume and he fought against Cylla again, this time defeating her.

Unfortunately, both Silver Fox and Matsu'o formed an alliance and used Reiko to trick Mariko into being poisoned. After realizing who Mariko was to Logan and what she had done to his love, Reiko killed herself. Faced with a slow and painful death, Mariko asked Wolverine to end her life quickly and mercifully. A heartbroken Logan reluctantly complied.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 57}}

[[File:Matsuo tsurayba wolverine 175.jpg|thumb|left|Matsu'o]]
After the death of the woman he loved, Logan spent the next few days sitting at her grave, even in the rain despite Gambit and Jubilee's protests. Suddenly, after hearing the Silver Samurai said the word “wraith,” Logan had a memory flash of the last mission he did with Team X in Berlin that resulted in the death of Janice, but now he also remembered the man named Wraith, aka Kestral. After experiencing this memory, Logan agreed to leave but on the way to the airport he caught Matsu'o's scent, quickly changing into his costume to face him. Wolverine then vowed to Matsu'o that he would slice off a part of his body on the anniversary of Mariko's death until there was nothing left of him.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 60}} A promise that Wolverine would keep for years until Matsu'o finally died.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 175}}{{r|Psylocke #4}} The death of Mariko changed Wolverine's character significantly, making him more disciplined and emotionally distant.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 176}}

===Nightmare Quest===
After his recent adventure in Windsor, his encounter with Omega Red, and after having experienced yet another flashback after hearing the word "wraith," Logan decided to investigate his past with Team X. He finally found his old teammate [[John Wraith (Earth-616)|John Wraith]] who triggered several of Logan's memories thanks to a [[S.H.I.V.A. (Earth-616)|Shiva]]'s head and revealed to him that he managed to capture Sabretooth.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 61}} Afterwards, Wraith revealed that he was worried that the aging suppressant given to all Team X members was failing. Wraith's fears proved to be true as one of the members of the team named [[Mastodon (Elefante) (Earth-616)|Mastodon]] died in front of them after the reversal of his "age suppression" factor.

[[File:John Wraith (Earth-616) 002.jpg|thumb|right|The mysterious John Wraith a.k.a Kestrel.]]
After being joined by Carol Hines in his quest, Logan discovered that Silver Fox was still alive,{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 62}} and to his surprise Silver Fox despised him for something she believed he had done.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 63}} But before Wolverine could figure out what Silver Fox believed he had done, the team managed to trace Mastodon's death to Aldo Ferro, now known as Psi-Borg. Psi-Borg overwhelmed them with his illusions, resulting in Carol Hine's death from a heart attack, and Silver Fox's death at the hands of Sabretooth. Sabretooth and Ferro both escaped afterwards.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 64}}{{r|Sabretooth #1}} Because of the deaths of both Mariko and Silver Fox and Weapon X's mental tampering, Wolverine suffered a mental breakdown.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 65}}

Nick Fury and John Wraith decided to help Logan and revealed to him that some of his memories of Silver Fox were real, as they brought Logan to their old cabin in Canada. He decided to bury her in this place next to the cabin where they used to live.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 65}} Professor Xavier also decided to help Logan by unlocking a memory about one of Team X's missions from the Cold War called "Terry Adams,"{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 66}} that led Wolverine to Russia where he met the soviet super soldier [[Epsilon Red (Earth-616)|Epsilon Red]] who revealed to him several secrets about his past with Team X.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 67}} Epsilon Red then used his powers to burn the memory implants from Logan's mind in order to unlock his real memories, but unfortunately the process was only half successful and some of Logan's memory blocks proved to be impossible to break.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 68}}

===Losing the Adamantium and Going Feral===
His investigation into his missing memories leading nowhere, Logan rejoined the X-Men just when [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] unleashed an electromagnetic pulse across the Earth killing thousands of innocent people. Xavier and the X-Men decided to infiltrate his [[Avalon (Space Station)|space station]] in order to stop him once and for all. Unfortunately for the X-Men, the fight didn't go as planned, and as Magneto was about to kill [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], Wolverine intervened, slashing him with his claws and saving Pietro's life.

[[File:James Howlett & Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 2 25 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Wolverine's adamantium is removed by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]].]]
Magneto fell to his knees but quickly retaliated, using his powers to tear the adamantium out of Wolverine's skeleton, causing extensive injuries which almost killed Wolverine.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 25}} These injuries overloaded Wolverine's healing factor for a time, and Logan also discovered that the claws that he believed a result of the Weapon X program were in fact part of his actual bone structure due to his mutation. As a result of his injuries and the loss of his healing factor, Logan left the X-Men for a time.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 75}}

[[File:Wolverine Vol 2 77.jpg|thumb|right|Logan showing his bone claws.]]
After he quit the X-Men, Wolverine traveled all around the world for a while, coming to terms with the loss of his adamantium and healing factor{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 76}} and facing some of his greatest foes along the way such as Lady Deathstrike,{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 77}} Bloodscream,{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 78}} and Cyber.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 79}}

Soon after, Logan encountered the mercenary known as [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] and was almost killed during their fight. But fortunately, his healing factor finally returned stronger than ever to save him. Logan went after Deadpool but Wade managed to run away, so Logan then decided to rejoin the X-Men.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 88}} Back at the X-Mansion, Sabretooth, who was a prisoner of the X-Men at the time that Xavier was trying to reform, managed to escape from his cell and as a result Wolverine confronted him. After a severe beating, Sabretooth threatened to kill Jean Grey, Kitty Pryde, and Jubilee. Logan snapped and thrust one of his claws into Sabretooth's brain, almost killing him.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 90}}

Wolverine's victory against Sabretooth came at price as Logan could feel his feral nature slowly taking over, and as a result he decided to live in the woods for a while.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 91}} Logan's descent into madness would worsen after [[Tyler Dayspring (Earth-4935)|Tyler Dayspring a.k.a Genesis]] tried to bond adamantium to his skeleton once again, but Logan rejected the adamantium in order to save the life of [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Sam Guthrie]], further losing his humanity and regressing to a more feral physical and mental state.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 100}}

Logan stayed in his state for a while but with the help of [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra Natchios]], [[Stick (Earth-616)|Stick]], and his friends, he was able to regain his sanity and he slowly revert back to his original physical appearance.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 111}}

[[File:Astonishing X-Men Vol 2 3.jpg|thumb|left|Wolverine as the horseman of Death.]]
===Horseman of Apocalypse===
Later, during a space adventure with the X-Men,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #371}} Logan was subsequently kidnapped by the would-be conqueror [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] and replaced by one of the [[Skrulls]] who infiltrated the X-Men.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 145}} Logan was then forced to fight Sabretooth for the mantle of the [[Horsemen of Death|Horseman Death]]. Knowing that he might be able to resist Apocalypse's programming and that Sabretooth would be a very dangerous villain with the support of Apocalypse, Logan fought and defeated his nemesis. As a result, Apocalypse succeeded where Genesis had failed, rebonding adamantium to Wolverine's skeleton.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 145}} As the horseman of Death, Wolverine completed several missions for Apocalypse and fought the Hulk. Meanwhile, the [[James Howlett (Skrull) (Earth-616)|skrull]] that replaced him tried to create a rift between the X-Men and their mentor, but was slain by the real Wolverine under Apocalypse's orders.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 2 3}}

[[File:Wolverine Vol 2 145 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine finally regains his adamantium skeleton and claws.]]
After discovering that their teammate had been a Skrull, the X-Men found out that the real Wolverine was Apocalypse's horseman and decided to help him.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 95}} Under the control of Apocalypse, Wolverine fought the X-Men ferociously in his Death persona, but Psylocke, [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]], Kitty Pryde, and Jubilee helped him break free from Apocalypse's control.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 146}} Unfortunately shortly after, Logan witnessed the death of his friend Colossus, who sacrificed his life in order to eradicate the [[Legacy Virus]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #390}}

===[[The Logan Files (Story Arc)|The Logan Files]]===
After rejoining the X-Men, Logan started to have more and more flashbacks to his past and was soon confronted by a serial killer named [[Mister X (Earth-616)|Mister X]], the immortal [[Jean-Pierre Beaubier (Earth-616)|Mauvais]], a new Weapon X program held by [[Malcolm Colcord (Earth-616)|Malcolm Colcord]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 162}} Ogun,{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 168}} and Sabretooth.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 173}}

[[File:Wolverine Vol 2 176 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Wolverine dead?]]
Using Weapon X technology, Sabretooth was able to remove Wolverine's powers, then he hired Omega Red and Lady Deathstrike who almost killed Nightcrawler, Yukio, and the Hudson's as well as kidnap Amiko, while he was stealing the “Logan Files.”{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 174}} The files were supposed to contain everything related to Logan's past before he was abducted for the Weapon X experiment. Along the way, Sabretooth betrayed Omega Red and Lady Deathstrike, almost killed Amiko, and revealed to Logan that the “Logan Files” were a lie. The reason Logan couldn't remember his past was because of his own healing factor removing his most traumatic memories. After this revelation, Sabretooth killed Wolverine.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 175}}

Logan's soul went to the afterlife where he was welcomed by the spirit of Rose O'Hara who revealed several things to him about his long life, most notably how he coped with pain, but because of his missing memories Logan didn't recognize her and he thought she was Jean Grey. While almost ready to let go of the pains of life and make peace with himself in order to learn the truth about his origins, Wolverine was attacked by several deceased villains who wanted revenge. Logan decided that he didn't want to let go of the pain just yet and decided to fight all of them one last time, as he was overwhelmed, someone intervened and helped him: his deceased friend Colossus. Happy to see his friend back, they both managed to defeat all the villains, but Logan's choice had a big consequence: his will to fight reignited his healing factor and his soul returned to his body, but before leaving Rose told him one last thing: "I'm not Jean."

Back in the land of the living, Logan made his way to the X-Mansion and discovered that Amiko was alive, saved by the Weapon X project and Colcord to make up for what Creed did. But this near death experience would have big consequences on Logan, leading him to have nightmares and an obsession with discovering the true identity of the dead red headed woman.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 176}}{{r|New X-Men #137}}{{r|New X-Men #148}}

===[[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus]]===
Not long after, Jean Grey and the Professor Xavier went to [[Paris]] and met a strange character named [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]] who revealed several truths about the Weapon X project, most notably that Weapon X meant "Weapon 10" all along and that the Weapon X program was just a part of the [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus program]] which created several living weapons through the years. It was also revealed that the latest weapons were created in the [[The World (Weapon Plus)|World]], a self-contained research facility built by Weapon Plus somewhere in rural [[England]].{{r|New X-Men #130}}

[[File:New X-Men Vol 1 150 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine and Phoenix]]
After defeating [[Zona Cluster-6 (Earth-616)|Weapon XII]], Jean Grey learned that Fantomex was also a Weapon Plus victim/project, that his real codename was Weapon XIII, and that he had also been created in "The World." Shortly after while rescuing the mutant [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]], Logan met Fantomex who called him by his real name for the first time in years: "James."{{r|New X-Men #133}}

Shortly after, Wolverine, Cyclops, and Fantomex infiltrated "The World." There Wolverine learned how he had been used in the Roanoke slaughter during the Weapon X experiment, and other Weapon Plus secrets.{{r|New X-Men #145}} It was later revealed that it was [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Sublime]]'s plan all along to let Logan look at these files in order to unlock this memory about Roanoke and to bring him back to this place later on.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 23|25}} After being confronted by the last product of the Weapon Plus program, [[Ultimaton (Earth-616)|Weapon XV]], Logan detonated a bomb blowing up the Weapon Plus station and Weapon XV in the process.{{r|New X-Men #145}}

Logan survived and was rescued by Jean Grey, but after they returned to earth Jean was killed by [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]] leaving the X-Men heartbroken and prompting Wolverine to behead Xorn to avenge her.{{r|New X-Men #150}} Wolverine mourned Jean's loss and was not pleased with Cyclops and [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]'s new relationship,{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 1}} but he remained a valued member of the X-Men, serving on as many missions as he could while also indulging in the occasional solo mission. It was during this period that Logan discovered that his friend Colossus had been brought back to life by the alien warrior [[Ord (Breakworld) (Earth-616)|Ord]].{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 5}} He also met [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Hisako Ichiki a.k.a Armor]] and decided to train her.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 13}}{{r|Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men #1}}

===Meeting X-23===
Some time later Wolverine received a strange letter from [[Sarah Kinney (Earth-616)|Sarah Kinney]] telling him that a [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|young female clone of him named Laura and codenamed X-23]] was created and used to commit several assassinations around the world. Shortly after, X-23 tracked Logan to the X-Mansion, Logan detected her scent and led her to a quiet place where they wouldn't be disturbed. Logan tried to reason with Laura, but Laura attacked him and almost killed him, but before she could deal a fatal blow, Logan used the opportunity to calm her down, breaking through Laura's conditioning in order to help her. After talking to her and telling her that he would help her, Logan and Laura were attacked by the S.H.I.E.L.D. and Captain America, who were here to arrest Laura for her crimes and despite Logan's intervention Laura was finally captured. Captain America with the help of [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] discovered that Laura wasn't in control of her actions so he decided to let her go. He told her to go find Logan and the X-Men, but unfortunately Laura didn't listen to Steve's advice and decided to disappear for a while.{{r|X-23: Target X #6}}

[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616) and Laura Kinney (Earth-616) from X-23 Target X Vol 1 6 0001.JPG|thumb|left|Wolverine and X-23 meeting for the first time.]]
Some time after, Wolverine and the X-Men were investigating several murders cases committed in New York. After examining the dead bodies, Logan and Ororo discovered several slashes similar to those left by Logan's adamantium claws. Their investigation led them to a super-being themed nightclub called the "Wannabees." In here Logan caught Laura's scent and when he tried to talk to her she stabbed him in the chest and cut his face with her foot claw.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #450}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #451}} Not giving up on her, the X-Men tracked her, and Logan finally confronted her alone. Laura attacked Logan again but this time he easily subdued her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #451}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 450 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine meeting X-23 again.]]
After clearing the misunderstanding, she helped the X-Men and Logan brought her to the Xavier Institute, although Logan made a deal with Laura and decided to hide the fact that he knew her origin in order to protect her.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 20}} While here, Laura acted protective of Logan, following him everywhere and even attacking [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] while he was sparring with him during a training session.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #455}} Not long after Laura decided to leave the X-Men, but Logan called her his “sister” and convinced her to come back to the mansion in order to work with both the [[New Mutants Squad (Earth-616)|New Mutants Squad]] and the [[Hellions Squad (Earth-616)|Hellions Squad]], despite Emma Frost's protests.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 20}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 21}}

===[[Enemy of the State]]===
Sometime later, a young boy named [[Character Index/R#Rikuto|Rikuto]] was kidnapped and in order to deal with the kidnapper the parents of the boy [[Ichiro (Earth-616)|Ichiro]] (who was Mariko's cousin) and [[Fukuko (Earth-616)|Fukuko]] asked for Wolverine's help. It turned out the kidnapping was a setup and Wolverine was ambushed by the Hand and killed by [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] who told him that they had already killed Rikuto.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 20}}

[[File:Wolverine Vol 3 20 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Wolverine under the control of Hydra.]]
The Hand resurrected Wolverine and Hydra used their technology to transform him into a killing machine that they unleashed aboard a [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 21}} Now in brainwashed by Hydra and equipped with several teleporting devices, Logan was able to face against several other heroes such as Elektra,{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 21}} the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 23}} the [[Edward McDonough (Earth-616)|Hornet]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 23}} and Daredevil,{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 24}} succeeding in completing his mission every time.

Although the fight with Daredevil proved to be decisive, Daredevil managed to impale Wolverine on a sword, creating intense pain which allowed Logan to break through Hydra's mind control long enough to warn Matt that Hydra was planning to kill the [[Presidents of the United States of America|President of the United States]] and that their fight was just a diversion allowing the Hand and Hydra to kill and resurrect Elektra as one of their own, before he was teleported away by Hydra.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 24}} With this new information the X-Men and the Avengers were able to defeat Wolverine and take him into custody.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 24}}

[[File:Tomi Shishido and James Howlett (Earth-616) from Wolverine Vol 3 31.jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine killing the Gorgon.]]
Back in the hands of S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury tasked a team of scientists with removing Logan's brainwashing and returning him back to his older self in order to use him against Hydra and the Hand. Once done, Logan started his quest of revenge and teamed up with Elektra to take down Hydra and the Hand.

In the end Logan faced the man who killed him, Gorgon, and was able to defeat him. After defeating Gorgon, Logan disappeared for months, searching for Rikuto's body. After finally finding where the boy was buried, he told his parents the location, saying he was sorry for everything.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 30}}

===Joining the Avengers and Recovering his Memories===
[[File:New Avengers Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|The New Avengers.]]
While on a mission in the [[Savage Land]], Wolverine met the recently re-formed [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and eventually accepted membership as [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] felt that Logan could provide a useful perspective to the team.{{r|New Avengers #6}}

As a result of the [[House of M (Event)|House of M]], during which [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] altered Earth's reality and then restored it, Wolverine regained all of his memories due to Wanda attempting to give all the heroes what they most desired, allowing Logan to finally be able to sort between what was true and implanted in his mind.{{r|House of M #8}} Logan then went to see the immortal blacksmith, Muramasa, and claimed the weapon forged with the piece of his soul just after Itsu's death. The [[Muramasa Blade]] now in his possession, Logan was ready to start his quest for revenge.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 40}}

[[File:Romulus (Earth-616) from Wolverine Origins Vol 1 40 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Logan facing Romulus.]]
With Emma Frost's help, Logan soon discovered that Daken, his son, was alive and was hating him. After meeting his son,{{r|Wolverine: Origins #10}} Logan tried to save him several times, but Daken refused his help, betraying Logan and attempting to kill him several times, even after learning the truth about how Romulus was responsible for everything that happened to him and Logan.{{r|Original Sin (Storyline)}} After Daken stole the "Wolverine" codename and joined [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]], he was able to steal a piece of the Muramasa blade, and with the help of both Romulus and the [[Phineas Mason (Earth-616)|Tinkerer]], two of his claws were bonded with the metal of the blade. After learning that Daken secretly wanted to kill Romulus just to take his place at the of head of his empire, Logan understood that his son was beyond salvation, so he decided to resume his quest of vengeance against Romulus.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #36}}

In the end, Logan was able to defeat Romulus and with the help of [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]], trapping Romulus in the [[Darkforce Dimension]], and then defeated Daken and removed his Muramasa claws. Once done, Logan hid both Daken's claws and the broken Muramasa blade in an unmarked grave near the Howlett Estate, putting an end to Romulus empire and legacy once and for all.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #48}} Romulus later escaped with Sabretooth's help, but Logan was able to defeat him once again and he was imprisoned at the [[Raft]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 313}}

But after all these revelations about his past, his son's betrayals, and seeing him join Norman Osborn's Dark Avengers by stealing his codename, Logan started to show signs of a nervous breakdown as pointed out by Yukio and Spider-Man.{{r|{{cl|Wolverine Vol 3 73}}-[[Wolverine Vol 3 73|74]]}}

===Leading X-Force and Nightcrawler's Death===
Shortly after, Cyclops decided to assemble a new [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] consisting of Wolverine as team leader, [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]], [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]], and [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] in order to take care of the dirty business the rest of the X-Men wouldn't do normally, including murder. Cyclops decided to add X-23 to the team without consulting Logan first, which angered him since he was trying to have Laura to be more than a killing machine, but despite Logan's protests Laura joined the team.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 1}}

[[File:X-Force Vol 3 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|X-Force.]]
The team completed several missions and welcomed new members along the way such as [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]], [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]], and the [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]]. Shortly after, the team was sent to the future by Cyclops in order to locate and help Cable and [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]] against [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] and [[Nathan Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]]. Once in the future, the team managed to defeat Stryfe and protect Hope but Bishop ran away. Back in our time, X-23 managed to save [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom Boom]] and kill the [[Leper Queen (Earth-616)|Leper Queen]], but she was captured and taken to the [[Facility (Earth-616)|Facility]] and tortured by [[Adam Harkins (Earth-616)|Adam Harkins]] and [[Kimura (Earth-616)|Kimura]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 17}} Thanks to the help of [[Alisande Morales (Earth-616)|Agent Morales]], Wolverine and the team managed to locate Laura and rescue her.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 20}}

[[File:Kurt Wagner (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 3 26 0001.jpg|thumb|right|The Death of Nightcrawler.]]
After this event Wolverine told Cyclops that Laura was out of the team from now on. Cyclops agreed but first he had one more mission for X-Force. During the events of [[Second Coming]], Cable and Hope finally came back to our time, Wolverine and his X-Force team had to help them against the Purifiers and the Human Council. Unfortunately, after X-23 killed a prisoner in front of the X-Men, the news about X-Force broke out and a rift developed between Wolverine and several members of the X-Men, most notably his best friend Nightcrawler. Before Logan could explain himself to his best friend, Kurt was killed by Bastion while trying to protect Hope and shortly after Bastion unleashed an army of Sentinels from the future which forced X-Force and Cable to go to said future in order to stop the source: [[Nimrod (Earth-10076)|Nimrod]]. Once Nimrod was stopped, Cable sacrificed his life to make sure the team could come back to the present. After all the members of the Human Council were killed, Bastion tried to kill Hope but he was finally defeated.

In the aftermath of the battle, the death of Nightcrawler had a profound effect on Logan, and news of his X-Force team broke his friendship with Ororo. True to his words, Logan removed Laura from the team and told her it was time for her to find her own mission in life and to be more than just a weapon. Cyclops then ordered Wolverine to disband his X-Force team, but Logan believed that the team was still necessary, so he formed a new X-Force team in secret with Archangel, Psylocke, Fantomex, and Deadpool.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming #2}}

===[[Dark Angel Saga|The Dark Angel Saga]]===
After the formation of the new X-Force team, Warren called for X-Force and revealed to Logan that he hired Deadpool (it would later be revealed that Wade had worked for Warren for more than a year){{r|Uncanny X-Force #5}} in order to investigate the activities of [[Clan Akkaba (Earth-616)|Clan Akkaba]] and that Wade had discovered that Apocalypse was going to be reborn in a new body. Logan agreed to help Warren and X-Force went after Apocalypse and Clan Akkaba.

[[File:Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine's Uncanny X-Force team.]]
Unknown to the team, Clan Akkaba resurrected Apocalypse as a child and was indoctrinating him into resuming his old duties.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #1}} The young Apocalypse was protected by a new group of Horsemen, but X-Force was able to defeat them and they discovered that the new Apocalypse was only a child.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #3}} After this discovery the team decided to not kill him and Logan proposed to bring the boy back, rehabilitate him, and train him but Fantomex, acting on his own, immediately shot the young Apocalypse in the head which created a rift in the team.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #4}}

After this event, Angel lost control of his Archangel personality, and went on a killing spree.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #8}} Trying to remove Apocalypse's influence from him, X-Force traveled to the [[Earth-295|Age of Apocalypse]] universe, thanks to [[Henry McCoy (Earth-295)|Dark Beast]], to find the [[Life Seed]], the only thing that could save their friend's life.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #10}} There, Wolverine met the [[Jean Grey (Earth-295)|Jean Grey]] of that universe, his [[Kirika Yashida (Earth-295)|alternate daughter]], and an evil version of [[James Howlett (Earth-295)|himself]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #11}}

When X-Force returned to their universe, they were attacked by Archangel and the Dark Beast, who took the Life Seed in order to restart evolution.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #14}} After a heavy battle between the forces of Archangel and X-Force, Psylocke was able to stab Archangel with a different Life Seed, killing his alter ego and saving Earth from the Age of Archangel.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #18}}

===Spider-Man and Wolverine: Time Travelers===
During what seemed to be a routine robbery, Spider-Man and Wolverine were thrown back in time by [[Time Diamonds|magical diamonds]] to the time of the dinosaurs. While Spider-Man secluded himself, Logan befriended a tribe of early humanoids. His involvement with them allowed them to survive the K-T Extinction Event. When the meteor came, Spidey and Logan found themselves flung into the future, where the extinction of humanity allowed the tribe to dominate the world.{{r|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #1|2}}

[[File:Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Wolverine and Spider-Man.]]
But in the future, the world was menaced by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-TRN157)|Doom the Living Planet]] and only one thing could defeat him: the [[Phoenix Gun]]. This gun could fire one Phoenix Bullet containing the power of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-TRN157)|Phoenix Force]], capable of destroying anything at the price of the life of the one who fired it. Despite Spider-Man's protests, Wolverine used the Phoenix Gun to destroy Doom, and as such he died in the process. However, Spider-Man resurrected him with a [[Cosmic Cube]], much to Logan's dismay, the duo was then assaulted by the pair of [[Czar (Earth-616)|Czar]] and [[Big Murder (Earth-616)|Big Murder]] who sent them through time once again using the diamonds.{{r|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #3}}

Logan wound up in a wrestling ring, facing down Peter Parker. He realized that this was before the death of Peter's [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|Uncle Ben]]. Meanwhile, Spider-Man found himself in a frozen wilderness as a feral Logan was hunted by [[Dog Logan (Earth-616)|Dog]]. They were then transported to [[Mojoworld]]; Mojo had been using Czar and Big Murder to arrange the entire list of shenanigans.{{r|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #4}} Wolverine became overcome with an uncontrollable anger; however, he did not enter a berserker rage, but instead became something far worse. After previously using the Phoenix gun and being resurrected by Spider-Man, the Phoenix Force had stayed within him, and as time passed it grew until Wolverine became the new Dark Phoenix.{{r|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #5}}

[[File:Wolverine as Dark Phoenix from Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|right|Dark Phoenix Wolverine.]]
Fortunately, Spider-Man managed to calm him down, and after Logan told the Phoenix Force to go away, the Phoenix Force seemed to leave him, the duo was then sent back to the American Midwest in the time of the cowboys. Peter fell in love with a woman named [[Sara Bailey (Earth-616)|Sara Bailey]] who had also been transported through time by the diamonds, while Logan became the chief of a Native American tribe. Any diamonds they found appeared to be inert. The [[Time Variance Authority (Null-Time Zone)|Time Variance Authority]] found them and set the duo and Sara back into their proper point in the timeline with their memories intact except for Sara who didn't retain any memory from this adventure, leaving Spider-Man heartbroken.{{r|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #6}}

===[[Wolverine Goes To Hell (Event)|Wolverine Goes to Hell]]===
After the adventure with Spider-Man, Logan visited John Wraith, who was now a pastor. A few weeks later, a child was found dead with three claw marks. Wraith found Logan but he was attacked by him and discovered that his friend's body had been possessed by a demon, this “[[Hellverine (Earth-616)|Hellverine]]” was going on a rampage against people Logan cared about, and Wraith was one of his targets. After stabbing Wraith and covering his body with insects, he burned Wraith's church with the congregation still inside before moving to its next target. Meanwhile Wolverine's soul was sent to [[Hell]] by the Red Right Hand with the help of Mystique to be tortured.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 1}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 5}}

[[File:Hellverine.jpg|thumb|left|Hellverine.]]
In Hell Logan met [[Marduk Kurios (Earth-616)|Satan]] and was forced to battle several of his deceased foes, most notably what appeared to be [[Victor Creed Clones (Romulus) (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 3}} Meanwhile, Hellverine continued traveling and trying to kill the people Logan cared about such as Amiko, Yukio, and X-23 while the Red Right Hand's army killed the Silver Samurai and tried to kill Maverick.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 3}} At the same time, the Mongrels also confronted Tyger Tiger and destroyed everything dear to Logan in Madripoor.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 4}} They then tried to kill Logan's girlfriend, [[Melita Garner (Earth-616)|Melita]], who was saved by Mystique.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 2}} Melita discovered that Mystique betrayed the Red Right Hand after she learned what the criminal organization intended to do to Logan if he escaped from Hell, so the duo teamed up with [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]] to recover Logan's soul.

In Hell, Logan discovered that the Silver Samurai had been killed by the Red Right Hand and that the organization was after everybody Logan cared about. Logan also discovered that Mariko had been condemned to Hell because of her past actions as the head of the Yashida Family. Mariko was then forced by Satan to torture Logan in order to break his spirit while Hellverine managed to get past the X-Men's defense and infiltrated [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] in order to burn Logan's belongings and kill Kitty Pryde, but he was soon confronted by Colossus.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 4}}

Back in Hell, after being tortured by Mariko, Logan was crucified on a cross by Satan and met his old friend [[Eugene Judd (Earth-616)|Puck]], who told him to not give up and to keep fighting as all the demons of Hell were watching him. After hearing those words, Logan was able to free himself and started to fight several demons, and then Satan himself. On Utopia, Colossus alongside Kitty, Iceman, and Angel tried to fight Hellverine, but they were overwhelmed by the demon's power. As Colossus was about to be killed, Melita, Mystique, the Ghost Rider, and Hellstrom captured Hellverine, took him to a church, and began the ritual to bring Logan's soul back to his body. In Hell, Logan was able to make Satan bleed, creating a riot in Hell and allowing him to crucify the Devil with his broken bone claws. He then met [[Thomas Logan (Earth-616)|Thomas Logan]] (his biological father), who told him he was proud of him. Logan fought "Sabretooth" once again, and defeated him. He then recovered Satan's sword, "Soulcutter," making him the new King of Hell. With the sword in his possession, Logan was approached once again by Thomas Logan and quickly understood that his father had been lying all along, he only wanted to use him in order to rule in Hell. Logan then decided to throw the sword to the demons and he punched Thomas Logan in the face, and together Logan and Puck decided to escape from Hell. 

[[File: Thomas Logan (Earth-616) of Wolverine Vol4 04 0002.jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine meeting his biological father, Thomas Logan, in Hell.]]
During their ascent, Logan tried to free Mariko but she refused saying that there was nothing left for her on Earth. She then bid him farewell and told him to remember her as she was before her death and not how he saw her in Hell. Logan and Puck continued upward, but along the way Puck fell, telling Logan to keep going. Thanks to his actions and the Hellstrom's ritual, Logan managed to escape from Hell while Puck recovered the "Soulcutter" sword making him the new King of Hell.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 5}}

But the demons were still present inside his mind, and as result his body was still under the control of Hellverine. Hellverine almost killed Magneto, Cyclops, [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]], and the rest of the X-Men while Logan was still trying to fight against the demons inside his mind. It took the help of his own memories, Melita, the X-Men, a subconscious projection of Nightcrawler, and what appeared to be a vivid memory of Jean as the White Phoenix telling him to forget revenge and live to burn the demons from his mind completely. Finally free, Logan didn't listen to what Kurt and Jean told him, and planned to get revenge on Mystique and the Red Right Hand for sending him to Hell.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 8}}

===Facing The Red Right Hand and the Mongrels===
[[File:Red Right hand 004.jpg|thumb|left|The Red Right Hand.]]
Wolverine quickly found Mystique who tried to talk Logan down in order to explain to him what the Red Right Hand had planned for him, out of respect for his friendship with her son Kurt. Having enough of her lies she told him in the past and her part in sending him to Hell, he decided to kill her. During their fight, the duo was confronted by [[Lord Deathstrike (Earth-616)|Lord Deathstrike]] who had been hired by the Red Right Hand to kill Mystique in case she might reveal the next phase of their plan, however Lord Deathstrike was defeated by both Mystique and Wolverine and escaped. Maverick called Logan to tell him that he found the location of the Red Right Hand's base, and Wolverine then resumed his fight with Mystique and killed her. He then headed to the Red Right Hand's base but unknown to him, Mystique's body was recovered shortly after and sold at auction to The Hand resulting in her resurrection some time later.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 9}}

Wolverine invaded the Red Right Hand's base where he was confronted by the Mongrels.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 10}} Despite what they did to his friends, he gave each one of them a chance to surrender peacefully but the Mongrels attacked him on sight and tried to kill him. As a result Logan killed most of them,{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 10|11}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 13}} while the others killed themselves.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 12}} After defeating the leader of the Mongrels, [[William Downing (Earth-616)|Gunhawk]], Logan confronted the members of the Red Right Hand,{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 13}} finding that they had already killed themselves, leaving Wolverine with only a message: the Mongrels were his children. This revelation and the fact that he killed his own children devastated Logan.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 14}} 

[[File:Mongrels (Earth-616) from Wolverine Vol 4 1 0001.jpg|thumb|right|The Mongrels.]]
After burying the bodies of his children, Logan tried to kill himself and abandoned civilization for what he did.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 15}} Soon after, Logan was living with a pack of wolves and rescued several children who had been kidnapped and forced to fight wolves by several criminals. Logan reunited them with their families, he was then confronted by Melita who brought several of his closest friends with her to convince him to come back with them. Logan agreed and said it was time to go back to work.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 16}}

Unknown to Logan during this tragedy, Daken worked with the Red Right Hand for years,{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 11}}{{r|Daken: Dark Wolverine #1}} helping them with their plans to send Wolverine's soul to Hell, but more importantly he was the one who found and gathered all of Logan's children. He then gave them to the Red Right Hand and convinced the criminal organization to use them against Logan. Daken's goal was to make sure that his father would kill his own children in order to hurt him in the worst way possible.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 14}} Later on, after he buried his children, Wolverine had a vision showing him how Daken had been involved in the Red Right Hand's horrific plot.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 15}}

===[[Schism (Event)|Schism]]===
Back with the X-Men, Logan witnessed the return of [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Kid Omega]] who set off a new wave of anti-Mutant sentiment. As result of Quire's actions, Wolverine and Cyclops steadily grew divided about how to handle this situation. Wolverine wished to hand Quire over to Captain America, while Cyclops wished to deal with him within the mutant community.{{r|X-Men: Schism #1}} When a new Hellfire Club attacked and incapacitated the X-Men at the opening of a Mutant History Museum, [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie Oya]] whom Wolverine had taken a liking to was the last one standing. As Logan tried to convince Idie to stay hidden, Cyclops pressured her to act leading to Idie killing a dozen men. Logan was enraged and blamed Cyclops.{{r|X-Men: Schism #3}}

[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616) Scott Summers (Earth-616) X-Men Schism Vol 1 3.png|thumb|right|The opinions of Wolverine and Cyclops diverge]]
After what happened with the Red Right Hand and the Mongrels, all the revelations about his past and the recent incident with Idie, Logan started to disagree with Cyclops about raising and training the teenage mutants as soldiers since it was only going to get them killed. After demolishing a Sentinel that was sent to destroy Utopia, Wolverine and a number of X-Men quit the team and left with a number of the teenage mutants to return to their former home in [[New York (State)|New York]] to make it clear that Cyclops has clearly crossed the line with his actions.{{r|X-Men: Schism #4}}

===The Jean Grey School for Higher Learning===
In order to start the new Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, Logan needed to retrieve all the fortune that he had amassed over the years, but unfortunately his money had been stolen.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 17}} With the help of [[Kenneth Hale (Earth-616)|Gorilla-Man]], [[Master Po (Earth-616)|Master Po]], [[Yuen Yee (Earth-616)|Yuen Yee]], and [[Fat Cobra (Earth-616)|Fat Cobra]], Logan managed to retrieve his money and was able to open his school.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 17|19}}

[[File:Jean Grey School for Higher Learning from Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 3 page --.png|thumb|left|The Jean Grey School teachers and students]]
On its first day, the school was assaulted by the new Hellfire Club, whom had been a major force in causing the [[Schism (Event)|Schism]] of the X-Men.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men #1}} Wolverine made it clear that he didn't want to lose any of the kids and fought as hard as he could against several Frankenstein monsters, whom [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] defeated by making ice clones of himself. Next the Hellfire Club sent a spawn of the original [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] to destroy the school.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men #2}} Kid Omega who wanted to prove himself to [[Broo (Earth-616)|Broo]], Idie, and [[Kubark (Earth-616)|Kid Gladiator]] (who told him they never heard of him) reasoned with [[Krakoa III (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] who then joined Wolverine's X-Men.

Wolverine, along the School's staff and students, then confronted the Hellfire Club and he made clear to them to stay away from his school. As the Hellfire Club members were leaving, Krakoa almost attacked them but Logan stopped him as he had a better idea on how to deal with them. The next day [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Matt Murdock]] told [[Kade Kilgore (Earth-616)|Kade Kilgore]] that he was being sued by Wolverine for the sum of 879 million dollars for the damages he had done to the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning and if he didn't pay, Wolverine and the School would take control of his company. As the school was being rebuilt, Logan was informed that Krakoa was glad they allowed him to stay and Logan found it good to have a school ground that could fight back.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men #3}}

The school faced several challenges in the following months such as the [[Frankenstein's Monster (Earth-616)|Frankenstein Monster menace]] and the [[Murder Circus (Earth-616)|Murder Circus]],{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #21}} the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)| war between the Avengers and the X-Men]] that cost the life of Charles Xavier, the return of Dog Logan,{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #25}} and a new rival school funded by Kade Killgore: the Hellfire Academy.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #20}}

Along the way, Ororo Munroe joined the Jean Grey school as a teacher and began a relationship with Logan{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #24}} and despite the departure of one of their teachers,{{r|Battle of the Atom}} the Jean Grey School prevailed,{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #35}} and in the end several of their students graduated by the end of the year and Logan succeeded in reforming Quentin Quire.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #42}} Not long after Logan and the X-Men even witnessed the return of Nightcrawler to the land of the living, with Kurt joining the school afterwards.{{r|Amazing X-Men Vol 2 6}}

===[[Final Execution]]===
After the events of the Dark Angel saga, the resurrected Angel and the young [[Evan Sabahnur (Earth-616)|Evan]] were sent to the Jean Grey School and the [[Kurt Darkholme (Earth-295)|Nightcrawler from the Age Of Apocalypse universe]] decided to stay with the X-Force team in order to track the [[Robert Drake (Earth-295)|Iceman of his reality]] who fled to our reality and make him pay for his betrayal.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #19}} Wolverine decided to use X-Force to make sure the students at his school stayed safe, but while the team was saving Fantomex from the [[Captain Britain Corps (Multiverse)|Captain Britain Corps]] in the [[Otherworld]],{{r|Uncanny X-Force #24}} Daken, the Shadow King, Sabretooth, the [[Harry Pizer (Earth-616)|Skinless Man]], Mystique, and [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-295)|the Blob from the Age of Apocalypse universe]] decided to form the new Brotherhood of Mutants.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #25}} Daken and Sabretooth abducted the young Evan while the rest of the Brotherhood hired the [[White Sky (Earth-616)|White Sky criminal organization]] to create [[Omega Clan (Earth-616)|three clones of Omega Red]] and to give them fake memories in order to use them against X-Force.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #26}} The goal of Daken and the Brotherhood was to torture Evan long enough for him to become the new Apocalypse, then to use the Shadow King to mess with his mind in order to force Evan to destroy the Jean Grey School, to kill all the students, to kill all of Logan's friends and then blamed X-Force for everything.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #34}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 34 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|End of the line for X-Force.]]
Shortly after Fantomex was captured by Mystique and then tortured and killed by the Skinless Man in front of Evan's eyes and to make sure the X-Force team couldn't stop their plans, the Brotherhood hacked Ultimaton and used it to kill Gateway and then detonated it to kill the X-Force team.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #27}} Thanks to Psylocke, X-Force managed to survive and went to the future where they met their older counterparts and discovered the truth about the Brotherhood's plan and what needed to be done.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #28}}{{r|Uncanny X-Force #35}} Back to the present, the team prepared themselves to attack the Brotherhood's stronghold to free Evan while Daken and Sabretooth were still torturing him both mentally and physically in order to have him unleashed the power of Apocalypse.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #30}}

X-Force then faced the Brotherhood but they were betrayed by Nightcrawler, as a result Wolverine was captured and tortured by Daken. The X-Force team managed to stop the rest of the Brotherhood and to punish him for his betrayal, Nightcrawler was fatally wounded by [[E.V.A. (Earth-616)|EVA]]. Wolverine managed to escape and knew that he had to kill Daken after what [[James Howlett (Earth-12928)|his older self]] revealed to him when he was in the future: "He'll kill the students if '''you''' let him live."{{r|Uncanny X-Force #35}} To protect his students, Logan decided to kill Daken by drowning him in a puddle of water.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #34}}

After killing his son, Sabretooth appeared and revealed that all of what happened was his plan all along that he wanted to hurt Logan in the worst way possible, an angry Evan almost killed Sabretooth as a result but Logan told him to let him go, revenge would only lead him to a path of destruction just like what happened here.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #34}} Shortly after E.V.A managed to create three clones of Fantomex thanks to White Sky technology, but after those events the team was disbanded.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #35}}

Later on after [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|the war between the Avengers and the X-Men]], Logan joined the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]]{{r|Uncanny Avengers #3}} and dealt with the consequences of X-Force's actions, most notably with the children of Archangel: the [[Apocalypse Twins (Earth-616)|Apocalypse Twins]] who resurrected Daken as one of their horseman in order to torment Logan.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #9}} But in the end the Avengers prevailed and the twins were stopped once and for all.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #22}}

===[[Death of Wolverine]]===
Shortly after, during a S.H.I.E.L.D. rescue mission, Wolverine was infected with a [[Microverse]] virus that shut down his healing factor.{{r|Wolverine Vol 5 6}} Losing his healing factor proved to be a shock to Logan but [[Nicholas Fury, Jr. (Earth-616)|Nick Fury Jr.]] warned him that this sentient virus from the Microverse that removed his healing factor was still present and was spreading all over the world.{{r|Wolverine Vol 5 7}}

[[File:Death of Wolverine Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|The Death of Wolverine.]]
With the help of [[Host (Pathogen) (Earth-616)|the Host]], Logan and S.H.I.E.L.D. were able to stop the spreading of this virus and eradicated it but unfortunately in the end Logan was left without his healing factor.{{r|Wolverine Vol 5 13}} After dealing with Sabretooth and the Hand{{r|Wolverine Vol 6 12}} Logan tried to find a way to reactivate his healing factor, so he went to see the smartest people of the Marvel Universe such as [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]]. But nothing could be done and at the same time, he learned that there was a bounty on his head.{{r|Death of Wolverine #1}}

After facing Nuke, Logan travelled to Madripoor{{r|Death of Wolverine #2}} and to Japan{{r|Death of Wolverine #3}} to learn more. After meeting Lord Ogun, he discovered that a new Weapon X project had been created. Logan headed to Nevada to put an end to it and discovered that Abraham Cornelius was alive and was trying to recreate the original Weapon X experiment. The problem was that all of his subjects couldn't survived the adamantium bonding process since they didn't have any healing factor, that's why he put a bounty on Logan's head in order to capture him and used his healing factor. But after discovering that Logan didn't have any healing factor anymore, Cornelius ordered his latest experiment [[Sharp (Earth-616)|Sharp]], to get rid of him but Logan defeated him. Cornelius then activated his machines on the test subjects in order to bond the adamantium to their bones. Seeing no other way Logan unleashed his claws and saved them by slashing the batch of liquid adamantium before it was injected into them but in doing so, the liquid adamantium covered his entire body in the process.

Before the adamantium hardened, Logan made sure that the test subjects were safe and then he went after Cornelius and killed him before falling on his knees in front of the sunset, looking back on his life and dying from suffocation.{{r|Death of Wolverine #4}} The X-Men were able to retrieve Logan's adamantium casing and Kitty phased him out of it, he was then buried in Canada in a secret location.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine #1}}

===Return===
Months following Logan's death, his body was found by [[Persephone (Soteira) (Earth-616)|Persephone]], the mysterious mutant leader of the criminal organization [[Soteira (Asset Management Company) (Earth-616)|Soteira]]. who resurrected him as one of her undead killers.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine #1}} With the reanimated corpse of Logan under her control, Persephone used it to carry out assassinations and other type of dirty jobs all over the world.{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Dead Ends #1}} But somehow, Logan's healing factor kicked back and he came back to life, breaking free from Persephone's control and killing several Soteira soldiers in the process.{{r|Return of Wolverine #1}} Now in control of his body, but without any memories and with his claws burning hot for unknown reasons, Logan tracked a Soteira kill team led by [[Zagreus (Earth-616)|Zagreus]].{{r|Return of Wolverine #1}}

[[File:Return of Wolverine Vol 1 1 Current Costume Virgin Variant.jpg|thumb|right|Back from the dead.]]
After a while Logan finally arrived on Persephone's island and was tricked into fighting against the X-Men,{{r|Return of Wolverine #3}} but soon after Logan was captured by Persephone who told him the truth about who were the X-Men. She then told him to follow her brother Zagreus to their space station where he could meet her and learned the truth about how he came back to life.{{r|Return of Wolverine #4}}

Once on Persephone's space station, Logan discovered that Soteira had gathered a small group of gifted people and that she intended to kill everyone else on Earth in order to resurrect them as drones under her control to help build the perfect society. She also revealed to Logan that she was the one who resurrected him as one of her undead soldiers and he killed for her all around the world, but that somehow his healing factor brought him back to life. Logan then decided to put an end to her plan, he destroyed her space station and after facing Zagreus one more time he finally regained his memories.{{r|Return of Wolverine #5}}

Now back to the land of the livings, Logan decided to head back to the X-Mansion but on the way he was summoned by the Fantastic Four to help them against the [[Endlings]] and [[Griever at the End of All Things (Multiverse)|the Griever at the End of All Things]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 2}} Once done, Logan was sent back to Earth{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 4}} and met with an [[James Howlett (Earth-21923)|older version of himself]]{{r|Dead Man Logan #6}} before finally arriving at the mansion and meeting [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]].{{r|Wolverine: Infinity Watch #1}}

After helping Loki,{{r|Wolverine: Infinity Watch #5}} Logan was then reunited with Cyclops{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 11}} in order to face the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O.N.E]] and its leader the [[Robert Callahan (Earth-616)|General Robert Callahan]]. The duo was later on reunited with the rest of the X-men, who were previously trapped in the [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|Age of X-Man reality]], and together they were able to defeat Callahan and his [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E (Earth-616)|army of Sentinels]] once and for all.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 22}}

===House of X===
Not long after, Professor Xavier returned and decided to use [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] in order to establish a new sovereign Mutant nation state. Wolverine and many other mutants lived here; he was first seen happily playing with mutant kids.{{r|House of X #1}}

[[File:House of X Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|The House of X.]]
Shortly after, Professor Xavier sent Sabretooth, Mystique, and Toad to steal data from [[Damage Control (Earth-616)|Damage Control]], but Sabretooth was apprehended by the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] while Mystique and Toad got away. With this new data, Xavier and Magneto learned the existence of the [[Orchis Forge]] (a space station located near the sun), where the humans created a new [[Mother Mold (Earth-616)|Mother Mold]] and were about to activate it. More importantly, Xavier and Magneto believed it would be there that [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] would become operational. The duo then tasked Cyclops with assembling a team to destroy the Mother Mold and prevent the creation of Nimrod.{{r|Powers of X #2}}

Cyclops' team consisted of Wolverine, Nightcrawler, [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]], [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Penance]], Marvel Girl, Archangel, and Mystique. Despite the effect of surprise, the X-Men's Shi'ar Scout ship was destroyed by [[Erasmus Mendel (Earth-616)|Captain Mendel]]'s kamikaze attack just after they arrived on the Orchis Forge which killed Husk and Archangel.{{r|House of X #3}}

Despite the loss of their teammates and the physical injuries they suffered from this attack, the X-Men decided to finish the mission no matter what. Their goal was to activate 4 levers in order to send the Mother Mold, the key in the development of Nimrod, into the sun. Wolverine, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops were able to activate three levers but Mystique failed to activate the last one and was ejected into the vacuum of space by [[Alia Gregor (Earth-616)|Doctor Gregor]] and the [[Karima Shapandar (Earth-616)|Omega Sentinel]]. To make the X-Men pay for the death of her husband (Captain Mendel) and despite the Omega Sentinel's protest, Doctor Gregor activated Mother Mold early.

[[File:House of X Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|The X-Men's last mission?]]
With only 30 seconds left before it went online and knowing there was no other way to stop it, Kurt and Logan sacrificed their lives by teleporting directly into space near the sun where the Mother Mold was located. Nightcrawler died instantly because of the heat, but Wolverine survived long enough to destroy the last beam holding the Mother Mold, which sent both of them directly into the sun. This victory for mutantkind came at a cost as the rest of the team was also killed during this attack leaving Xavier and the rest of the X-Men on Krakoa heartbroken.{{r|House of X #4}}

Not long after, Wolverine and the other dead X-Men were resurrected through a strange process by a group of mutant known as [[Five (Earth-616)|“The Five”]] ([[Eva Bell (Earth-616)|Tempus]], [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]], [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]], and [[Fabio Medina (Earth-616)|Goldballs]]). A new regrown body was created for each of the deceased X-Men and to finish the process, Professor X, with the help of Cerebro, transferred a stored copy of the deceased mutant's minds and essences into their new re-grown bodies. This process allowed The Five and Professor Xavier to completely restore the bodies, the powers, and the minds of Wolverine and the other X-Men as they were just before they left for the mission on the Orchis Forge, since they were beyond the reach of Cerebro when they died.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 6}}

Wolverine and the other resurrected X-Men were then acclaimed as the heroes of Krakoa by Storm and all the mutant population of Krakoa. But two days later, Professor Xavier decided to allow all the mutant villains on Krakoa which displeased Wolverine who thought that it was a mistake, since some of them were beyond salvation.{{r|House of X #5}}

After the vote to recognize Krakoa as an independent mutant homeland was passed at the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]],{{r|House of X #5}} and after the banishment of Sabretooth by the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council of Krakoa]] for disobeying Magneto's orders and murdering several guards of Damage Control, Wolverine alongside the other mutants of Krakoa held a great party to celebrate the birth of their new nation.{{r|House of X #6}}

===[[Dawn of X]]===
[[File: X-Men Vol 5 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Dawn of X.]]
In this brave new world, Wolverine was first seen living in the Summer House, a Krakoan biome located adjacent of the [[Blue Area of the Moon]]. The Summer House was the home of the Summers clan and other mutant allies but also served as a base of operations.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 1}} 

Wolverine also stayed in contact with Kitty Pryde after learning she couldn't use the Krakoa gateways to travel to the island like the rest of the mutants, he was wondering if she could use those gateways from the Island side. Back on Krakoa, Logan was also having a hard time adjusting to Krakoa "prix fixe menu," but knowing that Kitty was about to travel to the Island by boat, he asked her a favor in order to fix this issue. To that end, Logan gave Kitty a shopping list that included ribs, Canadian Club whisky, coffee, suds and Cubano sandwiches among other things.

Fortunately, Kitty arrived shortly after to Krakoa for the first time and delivered the goods, which made Logan really happy.{{r|Marauders #1}}

Later on, Wolverine discovered that a strange new creature appeared on Krakoa and was killing other creatures in its path, so he decided to hunt it for several days. At one point during this hunt, the creature attacked [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] and tried to kill him, but thankfully Wolverine intervened in time making the creature ran away and saving Beast's life. Beast asked Wolverine to not kill the creature since he wanted to analyze it in order to understand why it would attack them since Krakoa was supposed to be a refuge for mutants. Wolverine then told Beast that Krakoa was more like a "Salad Bar" than a refuge, and there was always a predator lurking around ready to feast on its prey.

Before resuming his hunt, Wolverine then told Beast that the reason he didn't see this creature coming was because he felt sheltered as a result of Krakoa making him feel safe and "when you're '''safe''', you're '''soft'''."

Later on, Wolverine was able to catch and kill the creature and decided to cook it and eat it, but while he was enjoying his meal, a group of Reavers was able to bypass Krakoa's security and landed on the Island. They then killed several mutants until [[Sage (Earth-616)|Sage]], Wolverine, Marvel Girl, [[Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616)|Black Tom Cassidy]] and Beast discovered what was happening and quickly rushed to the scene in order to stop them. Most of the Reavers died during this attack but unfortunately Wolverine, Marvel Girl and Beast were too late to stop the last one. The last Reaver tracked Professor Xavier who tried to reason with him, but the Reaver shot Xavier instead.

Hearing the shot, Wolverine rushed to the shooter and was about to kill him until Beast told him to stop since they needed a Reaver alive to know more about what happened. They then discovered with horror that Xavier had been shot through the head, and was now lying dead alongside his destroyed mobile Cerebro unit.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 1}}

[[File:X-Force Vol 6 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine and Kid Omega facing XENO's bioweapons.]]
After the mutant population of Krakoa paid their respect to the deceased Professor Xavier, Wolverine followed the assassins' trail to South Korea while Black Tom, Cecilia Reyes and Sage tried to learn more about the attack by analyzing the bodies of the dead Reavers. They discovered that the killers had been enhanced but also that they used skin grafts from Domino's body to fool Krakoa's defenses.

At the South Korea's airport, Wolverine met Kid Omega who was also investigating Professor Xavier's murder and was seeking revenge. Logan decided to team up with Quentin, and together they managed to find the killer's HQ at a printing press outside of Seoul. Inside they discovered an assassins' factory, full of half-grown killers who suddenly awakened and tried to kill them. While Wolverine was fighting his way through those monsters, Kid Omega discovered with horror Domino half flayed but still alive.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 2}}

Wolverine was able to free Domino, but the trio was soon attacked by a gigantic bioweapon, but thanks to Kid Omega and Domino the trio was able to escape and after the assassins' factory self exploded, they returned to Krakoa. On Krakoa, after trying to read the last surviving Reaver's mind, Marvel Girl alongside Beast went looking for one of Professor Xavier's Cerebro backup unit. After the Five recreated Xavier's body, Marvel Girl used the Cerebro backup unit to complete the process and bring the Professor back to life. Unknown to the team, while they were busy investigating, someone on Krakoa secretly killed the last surviving Reaver.

Shortly after, Professor Xavier and Magneto organized a secret meeting in Krakoa at [[Pointe|The Pointe]] behind a waterfall and called for Wolverine, Marvel Girl, Beast, Kid Omega, Domino and Sage. In order to face this mysterious shadowy organization responsible for the attack on Krakoa and his death, Professor Xavier decided that Krakoa had to respond in kind. Since Marvel Girl, Beast and Sage studied their enemies they would become the "head" of this new team while Wolverine, Kid Omega and Domino who hunted and spilled the blood of their enemies would be the "fist."

[[File: X-Force Vol 6 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|The new X-Force.]]
Once done and with the creation of this new team now official, Xavier ended the meeting by saying: "To me my X-Force." Unknown to the mutants, their enemies, under the leadership of a strange man with a Peacock tattoo, also created their own organization in order to destroy mutantkind once and for all: [[XENO (Earth-616)|XENO]].{{r|X-Force Vol 6 3}}

Shortly after, XENO launched several attacks against several companies owned by Professor Xavier, which forced the Quiet Council of Krakoa to task X-Force to intervene. While Marvel Girl, Beast and Sage investigated the scenes of crime, Wolverine, Kid Omega and Domino went to see Forge, who was now acting as the weapon expert of Krakoa, in order to get some firepower. While the team was getting ready, Wolverine discovered a pool of liquid adamantium in Forge's armory. Forge revealed that the Professor Xavier ordered that this pool of liquid adamantium must be used whenever they needed to put Wolverine back together in case he died or worse.

Soon after Beast and Sage discovered that one of the Krakoa's clean research facility located in California was attacked prompting Wolverine, Kid Omega and Domino to quickly confront the attackers. But as Wolverine and Kid Omega were jumping through one of the Krakoan gate in order to teleport to the California's facility, the attackers blew up the gate on their side during the teleportation which beheaded Kid Omega and cut Wolverine in half and left Domino stranded on Krakoa.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 4}}

Thanks to his healing factor, Wolverine survived and warned Domino to hurry up before the attackers could escape. With the Krakoa gate down, Domino contacted Beast and Sage and asked them to tell Black Tom to find Gateway in order to teleport to the California's facility. Once done Domino was joined by Forge, they retrieved Wolverine's lower body and then prepared to teleport to Wolverine's location.

At the California's facility, after killing all the workers, the attackers stole several [[Flowers of Krakoa|Krakoan petals]] and were about to leave. Despite missing his lower body, Wolverine was able to catch up to them and killed one of them, but in his condition he was no match for the rest of the attackers and ended up being riddled with bullets.

But Wolverine's actions allowed Domino, Forge and Gateway to arrive just in time to stop the attackers from getting away. Angry by what happened to her previously, Domino killed two of them while Gateway killed the others. While Domino and Gateway were busy handling the attackers, Forge quickly rushed to Wolverine, smashed his lower body and his upper body together and told Logan to wait until his healing factor took care of his guts and fused his spinal cord. Still angry, Domino was about to kill the last of the attacker despite Beast ordering her to stand down as they needed a prisoner alive to know more about the attack, but after discovering that the last attacker wasn't a bioweapon like the ones she encountered previously she spared his life.

The mission over and after healing from his injuries, Wolverine went to check on Domino to see if she was okay, he then told her that Kid Omega was about to be resurrected soon but in the meantime they could enjoy the quiet. Elsewhere, Beast and Marvel Girl interrogated the last surviving attacker and discovered in his mind the face of their true enemy: The man with the peacock tattoo.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 5}}

After Kid Omega's resurrection, Professor Xavier and Black Tom on behalf of Krakoa went to [[Terra Verde]] to sign a treaty between the two nations, but they were soon attacked by strange new plant people. Black Tom was able to protect Xavier and the President of Terra Verde, [[Manuel Cocom (Earth-616)|Manuel Cocom]], only suffered minor injuries but his son was kidnapped during the attack. After this attack, the president of Terra Verde publicly announced that he would no longer sign the treaty which forced Beast and Sage to investigate. Beast and Marvel Girl then went to Terra Verde and discovered that the plant people who attacked the President and were now holding his son hostage, were Telefloronic scientists that have been driven mad and were now under the control of a hostile botanical intelligence.

To deal with this problem, Beast gathered Wolverine and the rest of the X-Force field team and sent them to deal with this new menace, the team soon discovered that the leader of those new enemies was none other than the son of the President, [[Hadwin Cocom (Earth-616)|Hadwin Cocom]]. Cocom staged his own kidnapping to force his father's hand as he believed he had almost perfected the coding of the telefloronics which would have allowed Terra Verde to rise in power but also to show to the world that they had an alternative to the mutant medicine which would have resulted in several countries no longer recognizing Mutant sovereignty.

X-Force was able to capture him and burned every traces of this experiment to avoid the potential threat of an "organic Nimrod" in case this new technology could replicate. Beast then secretly "cured" Cocom of his condition which left him brain-dead before returning him to his father, who was now indebted to the mutants and accepted to sign the treaty. But unknown to Beast, Cocom wasn't cured of his condition, his body changed once again into a new "plant" form, he then escaped from his father's home.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 6}}

[[File: James Howlett (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 5 5 001.jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine tracking Serafina.]]
Not long after, Cyclops sent Wolverine after [[Serafina (Earth-616)|Serafina]] who escaped from the X-Men previously.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 1}} Logan was able to track her to [[Ecuador]] but he couldn't catch her in time and as a result she was able to enter the Vault where she used to live with the rest of [[Children of the Vault (Earth-616)|the Children of the Vault]] years ago. Professor Xavier and Cyclops decided to send a new team inside the Vault to gather new information about this threat, [[Everett Thomas (Earth-616)|Synch]], [[Armando Muñoz (Earth-616)|Darwin]], and Laura Kinney, who was now once again called "Wolverine" for this mission with Logan's blessing.

After telling the team the risks, Laura asked Logan why he couldn't take part in this mission, Logan told her he couldn't because he had something more pressing that couldn't wait. Unfortunately, the X-Men lost contact with the team after they entered the Vault, and more than three months later they were still without any news of them. Even worse, as time worked differently inside the Vault, it means they were gone for more than 500 years.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 5}} 

Wolverine alongside Kate Pryde, Professor Xavier, Magneto, Storm, Iceman, Bishop, and [[St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616)| Pyro]] later went to [[4 Yancy Street]], the new Headquarter of the Fantastic Four, in order to convince the most powerful mutant on earth, [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]], to join Krakoa.{{r|X-Men / Fantastic Four Vol 2 1}}

===The Flower Cartel===
[[File: Wolverine Vol 7 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|The Best is back]]
Not long after, Wolverine was back on Krakoa and decided to play hide and seek with several young mutants until Marvel Girl arrived and told him that Kate Pryde was waiting for him.

Wolverine quickly joined Kate who told him that he changed, he seemed happy surrounded by his family and with now a true purpose, protecting them. She then told him that several shipments of Krakoa petals have disappeared recently and she needed his help to find out who was responsible. At the same time in [[Baltimore]], a C.I.A agent, [[Jeffrey Bannister (Earth-616)|Jeff Bannister]], was called on a crime scene in a drug factory where he discovered that a new drug was created from the Krakoan petals that disappeared: [[Pollen|The Pollen]]. Jeff later learned that this new drug could make anyone smarter and stronger.

The next day, Wolverine went to see Sage who told him that she had a lead in [[Russia]] outside of [[Moscow]]. One day later, Wolverine called for X-Force and thanks to [[Gateway (Earth-616)|Gateway]] the team was teleported to Russia. The team arrived during one of the [[Order of X (Earth-616)|Order of X]] secret meeting, after seeing the team arrived the members of the cult ingested a dose of Pollen, they then attacked X-Force and tried to eat them alive. The Team was able to repel the cultists' attack but then discovered that their bodies dissolved in front of them because of the Pollen. The next day, Wolverine was able to find the Russian Gangsters who sold the drugs to the Order of X members and discovered that the one who supplied them the Pollen was a woman, [[Meredith Milly (Earth-616)|“The Pale Girl”]], whose abilities allowed her to enter in the head of anyone and control them. 

[[File:X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616) from Wolverine Vol 7 1 002.jpg|thumb|right|X-Force ready to face the Order of X]]
The next day, Wolverine learned from Beast that more and more people were starting to talk about this drug, and feared that a new drug war was coming and that the mutants may be responsible. At the same time Jeff Bannister, was worried about the number of deaths related to this new drug and the one responsible was the [[Flower Cartel (Earth-616)|The Flower Cartel]]. This cartel was eliminating the competition in order to control the distribution of the Pollen, Jeff also started to have suspicions that the mutants may be involved in the black market distribution of the Krakoa drugs. To verify his claim, he decided to go undercover and arranged a meeting with the Flower Cartel, in [[Alaska (State)|Alaska]]. 

Later in Alaska, Wolverine awakened without any memory of who he was and discovered with horror that Marvel Girl, Domino and Kid Omega were dead, most likely at his hands even though he thought it couldn't be possible. Logan then saw a trail of footprints exiting the scene and decided to followed it. After a while Logan had a vision of the Pale Girl, he blamed her for what happened before being confronted by Jeff Bannister and the rest of the C.I.A undercover agents who asked him who he was, Logan answered: “I been wondering the same thing.”{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 1}} 
 
===Catacombs===
[[File:Arkady Rossovich (Earth-616) from Wolverine Vol 7 1 page 36 textless.jpg|thumb|left|Omega Red comes to Krakoa.]]
Later, Wolverine was running through Krakoa, trying to make sense of this new situation, and more especially, to the fact that several villains were now living on the island. Suddenly, someone crossed one of the Krakoa gates and arrived on the Island, Omega Red. Omega Red was injured and covered in blood and was asking for amnesty while taunting Wolverine, but Wolverine, knowing what kind of monster Omega Red was, warned him to go back where he came from before attacking him. Magneto stopped the fight, and told Logan to stand down saying that Omega Red was welcomed here which angered Logan, Magneto then sent Wolverine through the Krakoa gate Omega Red came from to investigate what was going on. 

After crossing the gate, Wolverine arrived in [[Paris (France)|Paris]] and discovered that Omega Red left a trail of bodies in his wake, after this horrific discovery Wolverine quickly came back to Krakoa and discovered that Omega Red was healed by [[Cecilia Reyes (Earth-616)|Cecilia Reyes]] before being taken to a cell until he recovered from his injuries and was debriefed. Logan once again told Magneto that keeping Omega Red around was too dangerous especially with all the kids present on Krakoa, but Magneto told him that Omega Red would be punished if he crossed a line and if one of the kids became a victim of Omega Red, they will be resurrected. Wolverine even more angry after hearing what Magneto said, told him that resurrection will never erase the trauma of dying, Logan knew that better than anyone. Having enough of Wolverine's insubordination, Magneto told him that he was now part of X-Force, the C.I.A equivalent for Krakoa, and as a result it was his job to find out what happened to Omega Red and to clean it up. 

Wolverine decided to interrogate Omega Red to know more, the villain told him he wasn't responsible for the dead bodies Logan found and if he wanted more answers he needed to go back to Paris and more precisely to a bar, the [[King's Oubliette]]. Wolverine went back to Paris and on the way to the bar, he met a woman who was selling dog roses but Logan said he wasn't interested and continued his investigation. Inside the bar, Logan was drugged and discovered that the place was infested with [[vampires]] who were now ready to drink his blood but thanks to his healing factor Logan recovered in time and started to defend himself. When the vampires tried to escape, the woman who was selling flowers, entered the bar and started to kill them, she revealed that she was in truth a Vampire Hunter and the reason she wanted to sell him a dog rose was to make sure he wasn't a vampire, since they hated those roses as much as garlic. 

Back on Krakoa, Logan learned from Omega Red that the [[Vampire Nation (Earth-616)|Vampire Nation]] was becoming more and more powerful as days passed and the bodies Logan found previously were vampires who didn't finish their transformations but unknown to Logan, the bodies he previously found awakened inside one of Paris morgue, drank the blood of the coroner and escaped. Wolverine went back to Paris and was able to track the vampire hunter he met previously to a church, [[Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre]], he then learned that her name was Louise, and that she was part of an ancient order, [[Nightguard (Earth-616)|the Nightguard]], which was devoted to fight the Vampire Nation. She then told him that because humankind has been distracted by the rise of Krakoa, the Vampire Nation used this opportunity to rise in the shadows. 

The duo then decided to investigate a nest of vampires in the catacombs beneath Paris but while here they fell in a trap and several vampires were able to drink Logan's blood but once done they stopped their attack and escaped to Logan and Louise surprise. The vampires then went to a secret place where the blood they took from Logan was transferred to their leader, [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]]. Just like the mutants were now united behind their leader, Charles Xavier, the vampires were also now united behind Dracula.

[[File: Vlad Dracula (Earth-616) from Wolverine Vol 7 1 001.jpeg|thumb|right|Wolverine's blood is transferred to Dracula]]
Shortly after he recovered from his injuries, Omega Red returned to Paris where he met with Dracula and revealed his true mission. His mission was to enter Krakoa and lure Wolverine to one of Dracula's hideouts in Paris in order to allow Dracula's soldiers to steal Logan's blood. Once done, Logan's blood was then transferred to Dracula, allowing him to now survive when exposed to daylight. His mission completed, Omega Red was given the Carbonadium Synthesizer as a reward by Dracula although Dracula warned him that there was a detonator hidden inside of it as he still had use of him. Dracula then ordered Omega Red to join Krakoa but to obey him.{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 1}}

Wolverine is a gruff loner who had a strong sense of personal honor. He also had a wild, animal-like nature to him and a savage, or "berserker," rage which he tried to control. He is also perfectly at home in the wilderness. He is known as one of the most fearless, brave, and dangerous men in the [[Earth-616|world]], stated by Steve Rogers. Wolverine had established himself quickly as the X-Man most willing to ''permanently'' deal with their adversaries. He developed close friendships with his teammates Nightcrawler, whose personality diametrically opposed Wolverine's, and Colossus, who often performed the "[[Glossary:Fastball Special|fastball special]]" with him. He was something of a father figure to Natasha Romanoff, Shadowcat, Rogue, X-23, and Jubilee. He loved many women, including Rose, Itsu, Viper, Silver Fox, Phoenix, and Mariko. There are only a few people that Wolverine truly trusted, which are Captain America (Steve Rogers), Nick Fury, Jean Grey, and Spider-Man (Peter Parker).

===Relationships===
[[File: Wolverine Weapon X Vol 1 10 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Wolverine's complicated relationships]]
Logan's love interests include, but are not limited to [[Rose O'Hara (Earth-616)|Rose]], [[Seraph (Earth-616)|Seraph]], [[Silver Fox (Canadian) (Earth-616)|Silver Fox]], [[Atsuko (Earth-616)|Atsuko]], [[Itsu (Earth-616)|Itsu]], [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey-Summers (Marvel Girl)]], [[Mariko Yashida (Earth-616)|Mariko Yashida]], [[Yukio (Earth-616)|Yukio]], [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Ororo Munroe (Storm)]], [[Jessán Hoan (Earth-616)|Jessán Hoan (Tyger Tiger)]], [[Gahck (Earth-616)|Gahck]], [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra Natchios]], [[Cassie Lathrop (Earth-616)|Cassie Lathrop]], [[Native (Earth-616)|Native]], [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Felicia Hardy (Black Cat)]], [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Alison Blaire (Dazzler)]], [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Neena Thurman (Domino)]], [[Melita Garner (Earth-616)|Melita Garner]], [[Jean Grey (Earth-295)|Jean Grey (from the Age of Apocalypse universe)]], and even X-Men foe [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Raven Darkholme (Mystique)]]. However, [[Itsu (Earth-616)|Itsu]], [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]], and Hoshiko's great-great-great grandmother{{r|Wolverine: Exit Wounds #1}} were the only women he ever actually married.

In the age of Krakoa, as polyamorous relationships become the norm, Logan is involved with both [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Scott Summers]] and Jean Grey-Summers.{{r|Powers of X vol 1 4}}{{r|Marvel's Voices: Pride Vol 1 1}}

===Religion and Faith===
Wolverine doesn't believe in traditional religions,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #159}} ("never have, never will") although he claimed to have prayed while he was in the army, revealing that he is Deistic in faith.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #165}}

He sometimes prayed at a Shinto temple in [[Kyoto|Kyoto, Japan]].{{r|Wolverine Soultaker #2}}

[[File: James Howlett (Earth-616) and Kurt Wagner (Earth-616) from House of X Vol 1 4 001.jpg|thumb|right|Logan asking Kurt what's going to happen to them in the afterlife just before sacrificing their lives to stop the Mother Mold.]]

It was revealed in his team-up with [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Marvel Boy]] that due to the effects of [[Weapon XVI]] that causes faith reserves to act as [[The World (Weapon Plus)|The World]]'s immune system, Logan had faith in God. After everything was resolved, he hitched a ride from a truck. He asked the trucker to let him out near a church, implying his religious awakening.{{r|Dark Reign: The List - Wolverine #1}}

During the X-Men's assault on Orchis in order to stop the Mother Mold and to prevent the coming of Nimrod, Wolverine and Nightcrawler were forced to sacrifice their lives after Doctor Gregor activated Mother Mold earlier than expected.

[[File: Fallen Son The Death of Captain America Vol 1 1 page 00 James Howlett (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine's powers in action]]
'''[[Homo superior|Mutant Physiology]]:''' Logan is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] who had been given an [[Adamantium]] skeleton by the [[Weapon X Project (Earth-616)|Weapon X Program]].{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #73|74}} [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]'s intel classified him as '''Power Level 9''',{{r|Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury #1}} while the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]] classified him as a '''Severe Threat'''.{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}}
* '''[[Healing Factor|Regenerative Healing Factor]]:''' Wolverine's body naturally regenerates most (if not all) damaged or destroyed tissues and organs at a rate which exceeds that of any normal human. The rate of regeneration is proportional to the damage caused.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} This process is automatic and Wolverine seems to have no control over it.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #12}} His healing factor, however, does not seem to stop Wolverine from feeling the pain of his wounds nor the pain of his body regenerating itself. The speed at which he heals has fluctuated considerably in recent years. After first losing his Adamantium, Wolverine's healing factor recovered and increased to a level far above his previous norm.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #92}}{{r|Excalibur #100}} However, it was significantly reduced after his last encounter with Lazaer, the Angel of Death.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 #61}} Its current effectiveness (after losing the healing factor, dying, and being resurrected with it intact) has not yet been compared to past values.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 64}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #105}}
** '''Contaminant Immunity:''' Wolverine's natural healing also affords him virtual immunity to poisons, viruses, diseases, and most drugs. For example, it is extremely difficult for him to become intoxicated from alcohol.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} It can be accomplish with extraordinary amounts of alcohol,{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 11}} and even then the entire cycle of intoxication and hangover can be completed in mere minutes.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Extra! #2}} Wolverine's healing factor has cured him of the mystical curse of [[Glossary:Lycanthropy|lycanthropy]] after he had been bitten and turned into a werewolf,{{r|Wolverine: First Class #11}} and from vampirism;{{r|X-Men Vol 3 5}} though it should be noted that the time it took to cure the werewolf curse was longer than the time it took to cure him of vampirism, when he was infected with vampirism he had also been infected with nanites to temporarily deactivate his healing factor and use him as a 'booby-trap' on the vampires.
** '''Fatigue Resistance:''' Wolverine is partially resistant to fatigue poisons produced from physical activity.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}
** '''Decelerated Aging:''' In addition, Wolverine's healing factor provides him with an extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process; Wolverine was born sometime during the late 19th Century.{{r|Wolverine: The Origin #1}}} Although well over 100 years of age, Wolverine retains the health, appearance and physical vitality of a man in the physical prime of his life.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}
** '''Telepathic Resistance:''' Wolverine has stated to [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] that he is resistant to telepathic probing, the from both level 9 psi-shields implanted by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]]{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 46}} and his healing factor creating “mental scar tissue” blocking it,{{r|X-Men: Original Sin #1}} although he is not completely immune to telepathy as he does appear to be vulnerable to extremely powerful telepaths such as [[Quentin Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]].{{r|X-Force Vol 6 2}}
* '''Retractable Bone Claws:''' Wolverine's skeleton includes six retractable foot-long bone claws, three in each arm, that are housed beneath the skin and muscle of his forearms. Wolverine could, at will, release these slightly curved claws through his skin between the knuckles on each hand. The bone claws are naturally sharp and tougher than normal human bone, allowing them to, even before they were infused with [[Adamantium]] they could penetrate most flesh and many natural materials.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} After augmentation, his bones became indestructible and his claws are capable of piercing any material (relative to its thickness and the force Wolverine can exert).{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} The Adamantium bonding process which affected his bones effectively transformed them into a new alloy called "Adamantium-Beta"{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #80}} which, combined with his healing factor, prevents his [[Adamantium]] skeleton from interfering with his bone marrows production of blood cells.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} Wolverine can unsheathe any number of his claws at once, although he needs to keep his wrists straight at the moment his claws pass from his forearms into his hands. When unsheathed, the claws are entirely within his forearms, allowing him to bend his wrists when they are extended.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #12}}
** '''Hot Claws:''' A new facet of his Adamantium tipped claws upon his resurrection is to cause them to heat up several thousand degrees in seconds.{{r|Wolverine: Infinity Watch #4}}{{r|Hulkverines #3}} A trait which is seemingly tied to Wolverine's berserker rage, how hot they can get remains a mystery but they can reach high enough temperatures to cause gasoline to ignite on contact with it.{{r|Return of Wolverine #2}}
* '''Superhumanly Acute Senses:''' Wolverine's super-human senses are a combination of a separate mutant ability and his Healing Factor since his sense organs atrophy at a much slower rate than normal humans.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #12}} His most improved senses are sight, hearing and smell. Due to these enhanced senses, Wolverine has claimed he can function in complete darkness as though it were daylight.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 4}}
** '''Superhuman Hearing:''' Wolverine is capable of hearing sounds from a far greater distance than any human,{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} and is said to be less developed than [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #12}}
** '''Superhuman Sight:''' Wolverine sight is improved, allowing him to see further than a normal human.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}
** '''Superhuman Smell:''' Wolverine's sense of smell is even more magnified and allows him to recognize and track objects and people just by smell alone.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} Daredevil once posited that Wolverine's sense of smell is slightly more developed than his.{{r|Infinity War #2}}
** '''Superhuman Taste:''' Wolverine can distinguish individual ingredients in food or drink he consumes at a smaller part per volume than a normal person.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #172}}
** '''Superhuman Touch:''' Wolverine's sense of touch gives him greater sensitivity to air direction and temperature differentials in his environment. He is able to sense Cyclops's incoming power beam based on the shift in air pressure that precedes its arrival.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #211}}
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' Wolverine's reinforced skeleton allows him to withstand high levels of physical pressure. His strength is also boosted to enhanced levels, allowing him to briefly lift over 800 lbs{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #4}} or more.{{r|X of Swords Handbook Vol 1 1}}
* '''Superhuman Speed:''' Wolverine is able to move at low level superhuman speeds. He has attacked faster than the eye could follow and even Spider-Man briefly thought Wolverine was faster than he was in their first fight. His combat speed seems more enhanced then anything else, as he has frequently kept up with Spider-Man in combat, and blitzed people before they pull their trigger fingers.
* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Wolverine's healing factor grants him superhuman stamina and is partially immune to fatigue toxins generated by physical exertion and thus has greater endurance than actual humans.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} His stamina has been described as metahuman, indicating the ability to continually exert himself for several days at peak efficiency.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #4}}
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' Wolverine has superhuman durability due a combination of his healing factor and Adamantium skeleton.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #4}}
* '''Enhanced Reflexes and Agility:''' Wolverine's reflexes and agility are enhanced beyond the capabilities of the normal human body.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #4}} On several occasions, he was able to dodge [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]' optic blasts with ease,{{r|X-Men: Schism #4}}{{r|Wolverine: Origins #5}} although this is partly due to his enhanced senses.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #211}}
*'''Animal Empathy:''' Wolverine has been seen to be able to understand the emotions of animals around them and communicate with them on a very basic level. Wolverine has been seen to be able to show animals his intentions and actions so he would not be perceived as a threat to them.{{r|Wolverine #1}}{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #85}}

| title = Former Powers
| body  = '''Solipsistic Manipulation:''' For the briefest of times, Logan had been touched by the power belonging to the [[Crystal of Ultimate Vision]] when he and his compatriots were forced into seeking it out for the extraterrestrial plunderer [[Horde (Alien Mutant) (Earth-616)|Horde]]. When after said assailant killed Wolverine by tearing out his heart and the relic had supercharged his healing factor to the point that a few drops of his blood could regrow him a whole new body from nothing.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 11}} Mr. Howlett was infused with all the knowledge, therefor, all the power of the cosmos and it's various denizens. For in actuating the Crystal's power one becomes all knowing and seeing; making the user all powerful through the law of '''EVERYTHING''' being related to the user through absolute knowledge of everything. Therefore enabling the manipulation of anything related to them through shared knowledge & experiences.
* '''Omniscience''': The crystal of ultimate vision grants it's handler absolute knowledge of all subjects and understanding, making them at one with the cosmos, expanding their senses and experiential understanding out and beyond the natural range of physical olfactory input.
* '''Omnipotence''': Backed by the power of the Crystal of Ultimate Vision; Wolverine was capable of just about anything he could vividly imagine. Psychically snatching away the fragment of the crystal that kept Horde longlived and everpowerful with a thought, envisioning the whole of the universe as if he were one in the same with it and even being able to reach out and reorder the cosmos in any way he saw fit too. 

[[File:Wolverine as Dark Phoenix from Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine as the Dark Phoenix]]
'''[[Phoenix Force]]:''' During a time travel adventure with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], Wolverine ended in the future where he discovered that a future version of Beast created a powerful weapon called the [[Phoenix Gun]]. This gun could fire one [[Phoenix Bullet]] containing the power of the Phoenix force which could destroy any target but also its user. While facing Doom the Living Planet, Logan used the Phoenix Gun and fired the Phoenix Bullet which killed both Doom and himself.
But shortly after Wolverine was resurrected by Spider-Man thanks to a cosmic cube, after his resurrection the Phoenix Force stayed within him, and it manifested later on turning Wolverine into the Dark Phoenix. Thanks to Spider-Man's help it seemed that Logan was able to get rid of the Phoenix Force.{{r|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #5}} During the Phoenix's tournament, Logan was once again empowered by the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]], hoping to use the Phoenix's powers to beenfit mutants and prevent non-mutants from using it. He was stripped of this power boost after being defeated by the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 42|43}}

As an host of the Phoenix Force, Wolverine possessed the following powers:
* '''[[Precognition]]:''' While masquerading as a masked wrestler with Spider-Man's past self, Logan had a brief glimpse into young Parkers future wherein the tragedy of Uncle Benjamin Parker occurred due to his hubris.{{r|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #4}} 
* '''Cosmic Pyrokinesis:''' An Avatar of the Phoenix can create 'cosmic' flames under any conditions even the impossible ones such as vacuum space or underwater.
* '''World-Destruction Capability:''' As an Avatar of the Phoenix, he was capable of destroying the world.{{r|{{cl|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine Vol 1 5}}-[[Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine Vol 1 6|6]]}}
* '''Cosmic Knowledge:''' While possesed of the Phoenix's power, users become a universal encyclopedia of insight into events that have, will or has yet to happen. Such as Logan being aware of the planetoid where the time diamonds were located before the world exploded; scatting it's contents across galaxies.{{r|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #5}} 
* '''Self-Resurrection:''' As an Avatar of the Phoenix, hosts are capable of reviving themselves after death. Logan's rising from his grave after firing the Phoenix Gun was as much due to Peter's tinkering with the cosmic cube as it was the flame raptors power reasserting itself while nested in his remains.{{r|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #3}}  
* '''Temporal Immunity:''' The Phoenix exists outside of space/time and as such its hosts are made immune to the effects of time manipulation.{{r|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #5}}

[[File:New Avengers Vol 2 5 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine infused with the power of Iron Fist]]
'''[[Chi Augmentation]]:''' In order to fight against [[Agamotto (Earth-616)|Agamotto]], [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Doctor Voodoo]] once magically infused Wolverine with the powers of several heroes, among them were [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)| Hellstorm]] and [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]] which resulted in the appearance of both an [[Hell-Mark]] and the "Heart of the Dragon" insignia on Logan's chest. With the power of the Iron Fist in his possession Wolverine had the ability to utilize the mystical chi in order to further enhance his mental and physical capabilities.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 5}}
* '''Chi Manipulation:''' With the power of the Iron Fist, Logan could utilize various powers and abilities such as hypnotism, mind fusion, energy absorption, energy manipulation, energy generation, energy detection, empathy, increased durability, increased healing, extended longevity, environmental adaptation, and most notably, the Iron Fist, by concentrating hard enough and long enough, to create a superhuman energy derived from the Heart of Shou-Lao, that made him strike with superhuman power and resistance to injury or pain.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 6}}

'''[[Symbiotes (Race)|Symbiotes]]:''' On at least three occasions Logan was bonded to symbiotes, either extracted from the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]] from the [[Klyntar (Location)|planet Klyntar]], created on earth or by the [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage Symbiote]].

The first time was during the Vietnam War in 1966 when he helped Nick Fury investigate and put a stop to the atrocities committed by the [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|Sym-Soldiers]] in [[Vietnam]]. After they discovered a survivor [[Rex Strickland (Earth-616)|Rex Strickland codename Tyrannosaurus]], who was part of the Sym-Soldiers and who appeared to have been separated from his [[Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|symbiote]], Logan was ambushed by Rex's symbiote and taken over. Rex managed to separate Logan from the symbiote afterwards thanks to one of Nick Fury's energy gun.{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam #1}}

Years later, Logan investigated several murders in an old facility in [[Northwest Territories]] in Canada and was ambushed by a [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|symbiote clone]] created from a piece of the original [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]]'s tongue. After a brief fight between the two, a nuke was dropped on them. Logan survived thanks to his healing factor but the Venom clone also survived by taking over a swarm of cockroaches. The Venom clone then ambushed Wolverine and bonded to him. Fortunately before bonding to him, Logan was implanted with a phone capable of shooting lightning by the [[Suit (Earth-616)|Suit]]. Shortly afterwards, [[Patricia Robertson (Earth-616)|Patricia Robertson]], a lieutenant in the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|US Army]] detonated the phone on Wolverine's chest which separated Logan from the symbiote.{{r|Venom #10}}

Finally, during a mission with the Avengers in [[Doverton]], Wolverine alongside his teammates was possessed by the [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage Symbiote]] that allowed [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Cletus Kasady]] to control them.{{r|Carnage, U.S.A. #2}} Thanks to the help of [[Tanis Nieves (Earth-616)|Scorn]], Spider-Man and [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]], Cletus Kassady was trapped in a sonic chamber, which separated him from his symbiote and freed Wolverine and the other Avengers.{{r|Carnage, U.S.A. #4}}

When bonded to a symbiote, Logan possessed the powers provided by them which included:
* '''Superhuman Strength'''
* '''Superhuman Durability'''
* '''Superhuman Stamina'''
* '''Superhuman Speed'''
* '''Superhuman Agility'''
* '''Superhuman Reflexes'''
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor'''
* '''Constituent-Matter Generation'''
* '''Shapeshifting'''

But also their weaknesses such as a vulnerability to heat and sonic based attacks.

It also has to be noted that during an Avengers mission, Wolverine alongside several Marvel Heroes was infected by a [[Venom Virus]] created by Victor Von Doom with a sample of the Venom symbiote's biomass, which was accidentally unleashed on New York City.{{r|Mighty Avengers #7}}{{r|New Avengers #35}} Iron Man was able to synthesize an antidote that stopped the virus from spreading and freed its hosts, Logan included.{{r|Mighty Avengers #8}}{{r|New Avengers #36}} However, while the Venom Virus was created using a sample of the Venom symbiote, it wasn't "technically" a symbiote.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1148371726121754626|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: "The venom bomb was not *technically* a symbiote.

[[File:Wolverine the Mighty from Fear Itself Vol 1 7 Billy Tan Variant 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Logan The Mighty]]
'''Asgardian Claws:''' In order to fight the [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]], he along with the [[Mighty (Earth-616)|Mighty]] had certain weapons blessed with [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] [[Glossary:Magic|Magic]]. His claws were enchanted which magically enhanced him in battle to the point his appearance changed. They were able to defeat them with the enchanted weapons. After their victory, they retired the enchantment.{{r|Fear Itself #7}}

| Abilities               = '''Skilled Tracker:''' Due to his superhuman sense, Wolverine is considered to be one of the world's most skilled trackers.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}

'''Above Normal Intelligence:''' Wolverine has an above normal level of intelligence.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #4}}

'''Expert Leader:''' He also ran the secret mutant strike team known as [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] to ensure mutantkind's survival by employing lethal force.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 1}} Wolverine stepped in once again as the field leader of X-Force, an intelligence organization in charge of special opperations to counter-attack assaults against Krakoa.{{r|{{cl|X-Force Vol 6 1}}-[[X-Force Vol 6 6|6]]}}

'''[[Martial Arts|Master Martial Artist]]:''' Wolverine has mastered virtually every form of hand to hand combat on Earth.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} Due to his age and experience, Wolverine has taught many heroes some form for fighting, these include: the [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]],{{r|Black Widow: Deadly Origin Vol 1 1}} [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men #223}} [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]],{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 24}} [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]],{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 9}} [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]],{{r|X-Men #122}} Primal,{{r|Generation Hope #4}}{{r|Generation Hope #6}} Sunspot, Armor,{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 13}} Jubilee,{{r|Girl Comics Vol 2 3}} Rachel Summers,{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 24}} Phoebe Cuckoo,{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #1}} and Shadowcat in hand to hand combat.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 24}}

'''Weapons Expert:''' Wolverine is a trained expert with many guns, blades, explosives and other weaponry due to his experiences as a solider, samurai, spy and mercenary.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}

'''Computer and Vehicles Expert:''' Wolverine is trained in the use of several computer systems and vehicle repair{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} as well as being an accomplished pilot.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #4}}

'''Expert Assassin:''' Wolverine has knowledge of several assassination techniques.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}

'''[[Multilingual]]:''' A polyglot; Wolverine is fluent in many languages including English, Japanese,{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} Russian,{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} Mandarin,{{r|Wolverine: Manifest Destiny #1}}{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} Cheyenne,{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} Lakota,{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} Spanish,{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} and Krakoan.{{r|House of X #3}} Logan also has some knowledge of Farsi,{{r|Wolverine: Origins #32}} French,{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} German,{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} Korean,{{r|Rampaging Wolverine #1}} Thai,{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} and Vietnamese.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} Notably, he is also one of the few individuals who has demonstrated the ability to understand [[Glossary:Doop's language|Doopspeak]].
| Strength                = As a result of Wolverine's constant cellular regeneration and the additional weight and tensile strength of his skeleton, he has some degree of superhuman strength, enabling him to press somewhere in excess of 800 lbs,{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} or more.{{r|X of Swords Handbook Vol 1 1}}
| Weaknesses              = '''Memory Issues:''' Likely due to his healing factor, Wolverine has experienced large periods of life without memories of certain traumatic events.{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}}

'''Sensory Overload:''' One of Wolverine's weaknesses is the fact that his heightened senses could be taken advantage of. For instance, when Wolverine was fighting the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk (Bruce Banner)]], he was nearly killed by the Hulk's thunderclaps due to his heightened sense of hearing.{{r|Incredible Hulk #340}}

'''Adamantium Allotropes:''' The Adamantium has thirteen different allotropes (variants) that are very unstable compared to Adamantium because of their different molecular configurations and thus physical properties. For example, Adamantium nine caused Wolverine to become dizzy and weak just by being in close contact with it.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 191}}

'''Hot Claws:''' The new addition to his abilities comes with the drawback of weakening his regenerative ability the longer he has them active, having gone full tilt berserker during a skirmish with the X-Men leaving him drained of stamina as they absorb energy from his Healing Factor in order to work.{{r|Return of Wolverine #4}}

'''Drowning:''' Of the few ways to kill Wolverine, given drowning [[wikipedia:Cerebral hypoxia|cuts the brain's oxygen supply]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #33}} He has admitted that being kept underwater can kill him, with the healing factor only prolonging the agony.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 20}} Wolverine added that he is not fond of being on water, as the addition of nearly 100 pounds of Adamantium to his body reduced his buoyancy.{{r|Wolverine Weapon X #5}}

'''Muramasa Blade:''' Wolverine's only specific vulnerability known to date. Created by having his soul infused into the katana, the efficiency of his mutant healing factor is decreased dramatically if he sustains injury from the [[Muramasa Blade]]. Wolverine has been wounded once with the blade{{r|Wolverine: Origins #4}} and, though the injury was very minor, it did not heal completely for 2 days.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #6}} Later the blade was broken and a piece of it was stolen by Daken and laced to the underside of his two wrists' bone claws, similar to his father's bonding process, by [[Phineas Mason (Earth-616)|Phineas Mason (Tinkerer)]]. Logan later removed the pieces of the Muramasa blade from Daken's arms and buried them with the rest of the blade in an unmarked grave near the Howlett Estate in Alberta.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #48}} After Logan's death, Laura Kinney and Carol Danvers were tricked into revealing the location of the blade and its fragments to the [[Orphans of X (Earth-616)|Orphans of X]] who melted it down and forged it into several bullets.{{r|All-New Wolverine #28}} With the onset of [[X of Swords]] however, two all new Muramasa Blades were made by the late Swordsmith in the depths of Hell. It was made evident that the mystic incisor can cut through Adamantium as stated by Logan himself.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 13}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Weaknesses
| body  = '''Adamantium Allergy:''' Wolverine was once artificially given Adamantium allergy.{{r|Wolverine: The Best There Is #4}}

'''Carbonadium Digestion:''' Wolverine's healing factor is also affected, though to a far less degree, if he ingests [[Carbonadium]].{{r|Wolverine: Origins #7}}

'''Adamantium Poisoning:''' Adamantium has proven to secrete poison which stunts Wolverine's healing factor and feral rage by a very small degree. Even though he has it laced throughout his entire body it has not made a significant change in his abilities. However, the poisoning will endanger Wolverine's life if his healing factor fails on him, such as when an inhibitor field cancels out his mutant powers. Following the loss of his healing factor, Beast is forced to synthesize a drug to counteract the adamantium poisoning so Wolverine can survive it without his healing factor.{{r|Wolverine Vol 5 7}}

[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616) from X-Men Annual Vol 1 11 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Wolverine is reborn from a single drop of blood and the power of the Crystal of Ultimate Vision]]
'''Decapitation/Severe Spinal Damage:''' Professor X once stated that Wolverine could be killed if his head became separated from his body, causing his brain to be unable to send signals to the section(s) of his body that needs healing. However, it has been shown he can fully heal his own body from a single drop of blood, however, this also required the immense power from the [[Crystal of Ultimate Vision]].{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 11}}
}}

| Equipment               = Usually Logan wore a [[X-Uniform|standard X-Men uniform]] or street clothes. His gloves often had grooves in the forearm so they did not tear when he unsheathed his claws.

[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|Wolverine's skeleton and claws laced with Adamantium.]]
'''[[Adamantium]]:''' Not part of his natural mutant attributes, Wolverine's entire skeleton, including his bone claws, were laced with the rare, artificial, and virtually indestructible metal alloy known as Adamantium - or True Adamantium. As a result, Wolverine's bones are virtually unbreakable.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #72}} The presence of the Adamantium has further enhanced the already razor-sharp edge of Wolverine's bone claws. Aside from being practically indestructible, the claws are capable of cutting through any solid material, with the known exception of Proto-Adamantium ([[Captain America's Shield]]).{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #3}} However, Wolverine's ability to slice completely through a substance depends upon the thickness of the substance and the amount of force he can exert. The Adamantium also weighted his blows, dramatically increasing the effectiveness of his punches and kicks. His claws is able to damage Class 100+ durability foes such as the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]].{{r|Fantastic Four #374}} His Adamantium claws has been shown to easily penetrate [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]]'s chest.{{r|Infinity Gauntlet #4}}
* '''Adamantium Beta:''' Adamantium Beta is a metal that can bond to the human skeleton.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 80}} The properties of Adamantium Beta is capable of bonding directly into the structure of skeletal material while not inhibiting the living nature of the bone.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 80}} The only known occurrence of Adamantium Beta was during the [[Weapon X Project (Earth-616)|Weapon X Project]] when it was experimented on Wolverine.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 80}} During the second part of the procedure, they laced his bones with Adamantium, and there was a reaction with his healing factor that bonded the metal with his skeleton.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 80}}{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #72}} As a result from [[Jaime Munoz (Earth-616)|Dr. Jaime Munoz]]'s research, the Adamantium itself can regrow just as Wolverine's natural bones can.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 80}}

{{Navigation

| body  = '''[[Death]] Armor:''' As "Death" of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horsemen of Apocalypse]], Logan was given an armor to wear to conceal his true identity and to protect him. The armor was durable enough to withstand explosions, Cyclops' optic blasts or attacks from Colossus, Rogue and the Hulk. Cable also noted that his psimitar did nothing against this armor.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 2 2}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 145}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 95}}

'''[[Ablation Armor]]:''' Due to the loss of his healing factor, Wolverine donned armor that can "withstand a nuclear reactor."{{r|Wolverine Vol 6 1}} The armor was developed by [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 6 3}}

| Weapons                 = Throughout his life, Wolverine has used a variety of bladed weapons, most frequently daggers and, at times, swords; as a samurai, he was especially skilled with the katana. He has also wielded many different types of firearms throughout his careers as a soldier, a mercenary, and a spy. While he was highly skilled with firearms and because of his perfect eyesight it is very difficult for him miss when firing a gun, he has stated on multiple occasions that he isn't fond of them and prefers to use bladed weapons, despite this, Wolverine used guns frequently after he lost his healing factor.{{r|Wolverine Vol 6 1}}

* In the 90s, the comics era which saw the peak of Wolverine's popularity, Marvel had the character guest-star in so many books, that from mid-1990 to mid-1993 (for 33 consecutive months), there was not a single month in which at least one non-''X-Men''-related book featured Logan.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/wolverine-guest-star-streak-1990-1993/|title=The Great Wolverine Guest Star Streak of 1990-1993|work=CBR.com|first=Brian|last=Cronin|date=1 September 2017|accessdate=2 September 2017}}}}

* Chris Claremont intended for Apocalypse to be behind the original adamantium injection in Logan's body. When [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] explored Wolverine's past as Weapon X, for no reason other than courtesy towards Claremont, he introduced the idea of [[Truett Hudson (Earth-616)|Professor Truett Hudson]] taking orders from an unrevealed higher-up, with the intention of allowing Claremont to reveal said superior was Apocalypse.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2013/07/26/comic-book-legends-revealed-429/2/|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #429|first=Brian|last=Cronin|work=Comic Book Resources|date=26 July 2013|accessdate=28 July 2016}}}}

* In {{cl|Alpha Flight Vol 2 1}} (August, 1997), when part of [[Department H (Earth-616)|Department H]], Wolverine was given a codename based on the Greek alphabet as Weapon X or "Chi." The letter "X" in the Greek alphabet is called "chi" and is written exactly like the "X" (ex) of the English alphabet. The use of the Greek Alphabet makes sense for Department H-related codenames. The Department has connections to teams named after letters of the Greek alphabet: [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha]], [[Beta Flight (Earth-616)|Beta]], [[Gamma Flight (Earth-616)|Gamma]], and [[Omega Flight (Jaxon) (Earth-616)|Omega]].

* Once a year Wolverine ventures into the woods on Native American land to remind himself that he is more of a man than an animal after a Native man helped to remind him of that fact during a period when he was more feral, in part by imparting the 'wise tale' of the 'two dogs' ''"Inside of me there are two dogs. One of the dogs is mean and evil. The other dog is good. The mean dog fights the good dog, all of the time." When asked which dog wins, he reflected for a moment and replied "The one I feed the most."'' During one of these yearly excursions he met [[Maya Lopez (Earth-616)|Maya Lopez]] who was on a vision quest and told the story to her and how he felt it related to him, the man who told Wolverine the story heard it from Maya's father a few weeks before her father died.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 54|55}}

* Wolverine's ''[[Dawn of X]]'' modernized brown costume came about because of X-Men editor [[Jordan D. White]] being tired of seeing the character in the yellow and blue costume. When [[Declan Shalvey]] was drawing {{cl|Return of Wolverine #3}}, the issue featured a scene inside Logan's psyche of him talking with a version of himself wearing his X-Force costume. When White saw the uncolored artwork, it occurred to him to use it as the base for a modern version of the brown costume. Jordan did a rough coloring of Declan's lineart and sent it to ''[[House of X Vol 1|House of X]]'' creators [[Jonathan Hickman]] and [[Pepe Larraz]], who liked the idea and implemented it into the book.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://www.adventuresinpoortaste.com/2019/09/23/x-men-monday-29-wolverine/|title=X-Men Monday #29 – Wolverine|work=Adventures in Poor Taste|first=Chris|last=Hassan|date=23 September 2019|accessdate=30 September 2019}}}}
===Creation and Development===
[[File: James Howlett (Earth-616) from Marvel Comics Vol 1 1000 page 37.jpg|thumb|right|The Creation of Wolverine.]]
* Editor [[Roy Thomas]] conceived the idea of Wolverine; the name, size, attitude and nationality of the character, thinking it was a good idea due to the abundance of Canadian comic readers.<ref name="Back Issue">{{cite web|url=http://twomorrows.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=422|title=Back Issue! 04|work=TwoMorrow Publishing|date=June 2004|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>
* Logan's main traits, those of solitude, fierceness and stumpy physique are directly inspired by those of wolverines.<ref name="CBR Thomas">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/roy-thomas-wolverine-origins/|title=Weapon X-plained: Wolverine Co-Creator Reveals the Truth Behind His Origin|first=John|last=Cimino|date=9 February 2018|accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref>
* When proposing Wolverine's creation to Len Wein, Thomas gave him the requirements that "(1) He was Canadian, and announced as such right away. (2) He was short, because a wolverine is a small animal. (3) He had a quick temper, because wolverines are known for being fierce and taking on beasts far bigger than they are."<ref name="CBR Thomas"/>
* Even though Marvel officially credits only Roy Thomas, [[Len Wein]] and [[John Romita]] as Wolverine's co-creators, Roy Thomas stated he considered [[Herb Trimpe]] to be one as well since he penciled the issue Wolverine first appeared in. Trimple himself didn't consider himself deserving of it.<ref name="CBR Thomas"/>
* Wolverine was drastically different when [[Len Wein]] first introduced him. Wein envisioned the character as being young, in his early twenties as much; his claws were originally part of his gloves rather than his own body.<ref name="Back Issue"/>
* One of the initial plans by [[David Cockrum]] and [[Chris Claremont]] when they took over ''X-Men'' was to reveal Logan was an an actual wolverine evolved into a humanoid by the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]]. According to Cockrum himself, [[Stan Lee]] nixed the idea.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-21/|title=Comic Book Legends Revealed #21|work=CBR.com|first=Brian|last=Cronin|date=20 October 2005|accessdate=2 September 2017}}}}
