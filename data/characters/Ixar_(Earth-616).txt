| History                 = Ixar was a warlord from a war-torn world, that had lost all its population in a stellar war against a nearby star-system. He came to Earth with his army of [[Ultroids]] to capture the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], because he can use captive super-powered beings to give his Ultroids the same powers.

He took the place of the mayor of [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]]'s and the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]'s home town to lure the super team into his space ship. When he was defeated, he left the Earth in search of other worlds where he could find new weapons.{{r|Avengers #36|37}}
