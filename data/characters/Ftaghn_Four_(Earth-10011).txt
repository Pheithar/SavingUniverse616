The past history of the Ftaghn Four mirrors that of there [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Earth-616 counterpart]] until their universe no longer experienced death.

Seemingly under [[Reed Richards (Earth-10011)|Reed Richards]] guidance, the Fantastic Four welcomed the Many-Angled Ones, who corrupted them into the Ftaghn Four. They told the Ftaghn Four of the ''"meaning of the word"'' "family", and Reed used his elastic body to unite the family by attaching them to each others, and live forever. The Cancerverse eventually began invading the [[Negative Zone]], and the Ftaghn Four were seemingly dispatched along with [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-10011)|Crystal]].
At incursion day +24, while attacking refugees, Crystal was opposed and dismissed by the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] of the [[Earth-616|Prime Marvel Universe]]. The Ftaghn Four stepped in, intending to claim control of the Fantastic Four portal to the Prime Universe and use it to infiltrate it. The Ftaghn Four attempted to corrupt the Fantastic Four, also intending to use their [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin]]. Using a [[Memorium Device]], the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] from the Prime Universe showed them his memories, and the truth. Reed and Johnny rejected the claim of those memories being greater than their current life, but were opposed by the enraged [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]] and [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]]. Susan used her force field to cut off Reed's tendrils from the others Ftaghn Four and return them their freedom, causing the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-10011)|Human Torch]] to go nova and destroy his family and himself, wishing to remain a family forever.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Fantastic Four #1}}

It is unknown whether they were regenerating in the Cancerverse of if the Negative Zone allowed them to be killed.
