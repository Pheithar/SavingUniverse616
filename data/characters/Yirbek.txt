| HistoryText             = The Yirbek governed a small planet in the Andromeda Galaxy until they were defeated in a war by the Skrulls centuries ago. The Yirbek have served the Skrull empire ever since.

The Yirbek fought a war with the [[Kallusians]] that lasted for several centuries, and ended with the [[Kallusians]] defeat. The Yirbek occupied [[Kallu]], but some of the [[Kallusians]] escaped into exile.

The Yirbek sent out probes which located the surviving [[Kallusians]] within the [[Milky Way]] Galaxy. When the [[Kallusians]] realized that they had been discovered, they left their hiding place on Earth to face the Yirbek in another interstellar war. 

The [[Skrull]] [[Raksor (Earth-616)|Raksor]] once adopted the shape and skills of a Yirbek while confronting the [[Kree]] [[Bel-Dann (Earth-616)|Bel-Dann]] in the [[Blue Area of the Moon|Blue Area]] of [[Earth]]'s [[Luna (Moon)|moon]].{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 18}}
