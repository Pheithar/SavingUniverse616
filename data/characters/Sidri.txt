| HistoryText             = The Sidri are a nomadic race of predators which evolved in deep space, on a free-floating cluster of asteroids. The entire species was captured by the [[Kree Empire]], along with other hive species, so they could turn them into weapons. However, after experimenting the Sidri were demmed a failure by the [[Black Judges (Earth-616)|Black Judges]] due to their mind structure.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 9}} After that the Sidri now work as bounty hunters in the [[Shi'ar Galaxy]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update Vol 1 4}}

Sidrian Hunters were hired by [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]] to hunt down [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|Corsair]] who had fled to [[Earth]]. Thousands of Sidri assaulted [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier's Mansion]] and fought [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], and Corsair. Who discovered that the Sidri were durable to withstand energy blasts from Corsair's hand blaster and Cyclop, as well as the wind vortex and lightning bolts generated by Storm. With Storm temporarily holding them at bay, Cyclops and Corsair escaped in the [[X-Men Blackbird|Blackbird]]. The Sidri gave chase as they merged and formed a skyscaper-sized flying Sidri. Which engaged the Blackbird (supported by Storm) in a cat and mouse battle in the skies over [[New York City]]. They were finally able to defeat the Sidri when Storm trapped it in a cyclone and Cyclops' optic blasts destabilized the Sidri ship matrix causing it to fall apart. Corsair then fired on a refinery, destroying the Sidri.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 154}}

A squadron of Sidrians later hired themselves out to the [[Crystal Claws (Earth-616)|Crystal Claws]], having been tasked with retrieving
[[Adam Neramani (Earth-616)|Adam-X]] and eliminate [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] who were in [[Brazil]]. Which resulted in a running battle in the streets and sewers of [[Rio de Janeiro]], ending in the defeat of the Sidri.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 3 3}} The [[Providian Order (Earth-616)|Providian Order]] would contract an army of Sidri (hundreds, perhaps a thousand) to track down Deathbird and retrieve her unborn child. They assaulted the [[Peak VII|The Peak]] and after extensive fighting they were finally defeated by Commander [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]] and Storm's all-female [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] team.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 18|19}} [[Samuel Alexander (Earth-616)|Nova]] later answered [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego]]'s call for help. The living planet was infested with Sidri. Using an asteroid, Nova pushed and accelerated it toward Ego, creating an extinction-level explosion that wiped out the Sidri infestation, though it gave Ego a headache.{{r|Nova Vol 7 1}}

A group of Sidri arrived at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|X-Mansion]], which was turned into a habitat housing the [[Flowers of Krakoa]], and turned it into their new nest.{{r|Giant-Size X-Men: Nightcrawler Vol 1 1}}
