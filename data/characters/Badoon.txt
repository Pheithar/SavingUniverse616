They were notable for having a gender schism, resulting in two separate societies:

Additionally, a third major group, known as the [[Moord (Inhuman Badoon)|Moord or the Fifth Caste of the Badoon]], were Badoon tinkered by the [[Kree]] similarly to [[Earth]]'s [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]].

===Origin===
The '''Badoon''' were older than the [[Kree]] and the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]]. There was a natural hatred between the two genders, and they fought each other in long gender wars. Eventually, the males won, placing the females in captivity. In time, the males developed technology and abandoned Lotiara, returning only when their mating drive made it necessary. The males became conquerors of worlds, while the females became pacifists, content to remain in peace on their homeworld and ignorant of the males' star-spanning empire.{{r|Defenders #28}}

Among the Brotherhood's attempted conquests were the [[Zen-Whoberis]] and the extra-dimensional world of [[Polemachus]].{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 5}} They were known to form alliances with the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]]{{r|Contest of Champions II #1|5}} and the [[Kree]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 27}} At the time of the [[Annihilation Wave (Earth-616)|Annihilation Wave]], the Badoon controlled 37.7% of the Milky Way galaxy.{{r|Annihilation: Prologue Vol 1 1}} The Badoon had recently warred with the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] and [[Kree]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 27}}{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 2}}
