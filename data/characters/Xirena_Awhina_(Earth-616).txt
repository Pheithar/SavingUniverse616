| History                 = The Promoter was a member of the [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elders of the Universe]] and like her fellow Elders the last of her race. Promoter's specialty was promoting entertainment events of all kind.

The Promoter decided to work with fellow Elder, [[Tryco Slatterus (Earth-616)|the Champion]], to promote a fight with the intention of proving he was the still the strongest in the universe. She decided to target [[Earth]] with an alien attack to lure out the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] so she could get the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] to attack them. Those two called themselves "the strongest there is" and "mighty", titles which the Promoter said didn't belong to them. Thor and Hulk told her they would gladly fight the Champion and the alien attack wasn't needed, she told them she was testing them because the Champion didn't want to fight against lesser combatants, the Promoter then forced them to go on a mission to prove themselves again by getting [[Tuurgid (Earth-616)|Tuurgid's the Unbeatable]] belt or she would launch an asteroid attack on Earth, they had to agree and she teleported them to Tuurgid's location.{{r|Thor vs. Hulk: Champions of the Universe Vol 1 1}}
