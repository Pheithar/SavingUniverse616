| History                 = 
===Early Life===
Anya, or '''Araña''' as she would be called, was a teenage gymnast from [[Brooklyn]] whose father [[Gilberto Corazon (Earth-616)|Gilberto Corazon]] was an investigative reporter. She moved to [[Mexico]] when she was very young, but she returned with her father to the [[United States of America|United States]] after [[Sofia Corazon (Earth-616)|her mother]] was killed.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 1}}

===Spider Society===
It was at an average day at school that she saw her friend Lynn being bullied by an older boy. Anya defended her friend, and the two started to fight. A teacher broke their conflict up, but that night the two went down to a bridge to resume their battle. When she got there, Anya discovered a stranger being attacked by a strange group. This [[Sisterhood of the Wasp (Earth-616)|Sisterhood of the Wasp]] attempted to kill the man, but Anya leaped in the way of the killing blow.{{r|Amazing Fantasy Vol 2 1}}

[[File:Amazing Fantasy Vol 2 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|175px|As [[Araña]]]]
The man, [[Miguel Legar (Earth-616)|Miguel]], was the sorcerer of the [[Spider Society (Earth-616)|Spider Society]], a secret group dating back for hundreds of years. Recognizing that Anya had the ability to become the new Hunter of the Society, he transferred some of his power to her to save her life.{{r|Amazing Fantasy Vol 2 2}} Because of this she gained a spider-shaped tattoo, enhanced strength and agility, and the power to grow a blue exoskeleton.{{r|Amazing Fantasy Vol 2 3|4}}

These powers first revealed itself when training in the desert, allowing her to defeat multiple ferocious beasts. However, her new abilities didn't come from Miguel or the Society; his transfer had unlocked her own natural potential.{{r|Amazing Fantasy Vol 2 5}}

As she joined the Spider Society as their Hunter, they gave her cover as an intern of WebCorps, a company the Society used to hide its actions.{{r|Amazing Fantasy Vol 2 5}} After developing her secret identity, she and her new team went on a mission to prevent the Sisterhood from empowering their own Hunter.{{r|Amazing Fantasy Vol 2 6}} 

===Heart of the Spider===
She succeeded, and continued to have further adventures against the Sisterhood and their hired help, [[Jon Kasiya (Earth-616)|Amun]].{{r|Araña: The Heart of the Spider Vol 1 1|2}} Amun ended up discovering Anya's identity, but she was able to convince him not to target her friends or family.{{r|Araña: The Heart of the Spider Vol 1 3|12}}

===Hunter Revealed===
Later, Araña learned that she was not a true Hunter, as no Hunter before her has ever had an exoskeleton like hers. In a battle in which the Sisterhood attempted to resurrect their Hunter (even [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] got involved), Miguel died and she released the power of the Hunter, letting [[Nina Smith (Earth-616)|Nina]] take hold of it. After the battle Anya quit Webcorps, but remained an active hero.{{r|Spider-Man & Araña Special: The Hunter Revealed Vol 1 1}}

===Civil War===
[[File:Ms. Marvel Vol 2 11 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Working alongside [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]]]]
She was part of the registered heroes during the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], though she never took part in any of the battles as she was still considered a trainee, although Carol brought her along to observe as [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Julia Carpenter]] was taken in and separated from her daughter which had Anya concerned she was on the wrong side.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 6|8}}

After the battle, she became something of a sidekick to [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]]. During this time her carapace was ripped off her body by the [[Kerwin Korman (Earth-616)|Doomsday Man]], leaving her unable to use it when she was confronted and attacked by Julia Carpenter shortly after while she was looking for her daughter.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 12|14}} She was also captured by the [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]] alongside other female superhumans to be used and sold as mind-controlled sex slaves, but was freed from his control by Ms. Marvel after being unable to attack Carol due to seeing her as a mother figure.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 18|20}}

Despite being depowered she continued to fight crime, though even swinging had become more difficult. It was around then that she became friends with [[Rebecca Barnes (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Nomad]].

===Grim Hunt===
Later she was hunted by the Kravinoff Family, for their conquest to kill all the "spiders" and resurrect [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven]]. She, along with [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Arachne]] and [[Cassandra Webb (Earth-616)|Madame Web]], were captured, and [[Martha Franklin (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)]] was sacrificed. After [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]] took his place in a sacrifice, Spider-Man went after the Kraven family. Madame Web was mortally wounded, and gave her powers to Julia before passing, to stop Spider-Man from killing the newly revived Kraven. Julia gave Anya a new costume, but she continued to go by Araña.

===Young Allies===
Later she and Nomad had become allied with another group of super-teens (referred to only contextually as [[Young Allies (Modern) (Earth-616)|Young Allies]]). They battled the [[Bastards of Evil (Earth-616)|Bastards of Evil]].{{r|Young Allies Vol 2 1|6}} They then teamed up with the Secret Avengers to take on Onslaught, who was eventually defeated when Nomad sacrificed herself for the greater good.{{r|Onslaught Unleashed Vol 1 4}} Later on, they came into conflict with Arcade while at the same time teaming up with fellow teen heroes from Avengers Academy.{{r|Avengers Academy Giant-Size Vol 1 1}}

===Spider-Girl===
[[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)]] called her Spider-Girl, another in a long list to get her identity wrong since she changed her costume. This led to Anya officially becoming Spider-Girl, in part to avoid confusion.{{r|Young Allies Vol 2 5}}

[[File:Spider-Girl Vol 2 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Anya as [[Spider-Girl]]]]
In later events, the [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]] had gone on a rampage, and killed Anya's father almost instantly. Infuriated, Spider-Girl went after the Red Hulk, but he got away. She was ready to give up being Spider-Girl when her friend [[Rocky Flint (Earth-616)|Rocky Flint]] told her about how [[Nargelle Flint (Earth-616)|her mother]] had been killed by the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]]. She decided that she still had responsibilities as Spider-Girl, and later attended her father's funeral. One night on her way to Rocky's house, she came upon a carjacking and went into an alley to change into her costume. When she got dressed she saw that Red Hulk had taken care of it, and wanted to talk with her. He explained how he'd been investigating the murder of a friend, when he came across her father, and worked with him, sharing notes on the investigation.

While investigating, the Red Hulk and her father had been poisoned, and as a result, Red Hulk had gone into the berserk mode. He explained that the organization behind the poisoning was called "[[Raven Society (Earth-616)|Raven]]." Anya agreed to work together with him on their hunt for answers. Later in the day, she confessed her entire day to an invisible [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Sue Richards]] who had already secretly known she was Spider-Girl, and who had been friends with her father for at least 7+ years.

Soon after, [[Anastasia Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Ana Kravinoff]] came hunting after Spider-Girl, using her Twitter tweets to track her down. After taking down [[Screwball (Earth-616)|Screwball]] for a second time, Anya looks at the footage that Screwball herself had been taking. She had then noticed Ana Kravinoff in the background during an interview. She then laid a trap for Ana, knowing she'd find her clothes. They got into a fight, which eventually led to Spider-Girl's victory and Ana Kravinoff's arrest.

In an attempt to impress [[Norah Winters (Earth-616)|Norah Winters]], [[Phillip Urich (Earth-616)|Phil Urich]] set up Spider-Girl, by tweeting her with information on a sighting of the Hobgoblin. Spider-Girl put gum into her ears and followed a trail of witnesses to the Hobgoblin. When the Hobgoblin laughed, the effect was not as great on Spider-Girl due to the gum in her ears, and she managed to hold her own against him. Spider-Man interfered, causing the Hobgoblin to getaway.

Spider-Girl asks Spider-Man for help in tracking down and attacking the organization known as "Raven," discovering different hideouts and valuable information. They followed a trail that led to a hidden facility, where they discovered files on a project aimed at brainwashing Spider-Girl as an agent of Raven, and that Anya's roommate Rocky was a kidnapping target. It also showed that her "creepy" neighbor, [[Kurt Godwin (Earth-616)|Kurt Godwin]], was an agent of Raven, and had been spying on Anya.

Spider-Girl rushed to her apartment to find that three Raven Agents were waiting there to recruit her, using her roommate and her father as leverage. Minutes into their confrontation, Anya felt her super-strength return, and used it to punch one of the "[[American Ninjas (Earth-616)|American Ninjas]]" through a wall, and took down the other agents. She then discovered that she had webbing as well, before getting information out of the Raven agents. She called Spider-Man about the base she found and went in for an assault. 

She took down most of the agents in the dark, virtually unseen. She called the Red-Hulk for help and destroyed a machine that kept the American Ninjas in line. They turned on Godwin, and almost killed him before Spider-Man and Red Hulk arrived to stop them. Anya then proceeded to rescue her friend and showed Rocky who she really was. Rocky then revealed she already knew, and they exchanged a hug.

===Spider-Island===
Before the events of [[Spider-Island (Event)|Spider-Island]], Anya and her group were attacked by [[Morris Bench (Earth-616)|Hydro-Man]] and beaten single handedly, until Spider-Man stepped in and defeated the villain.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 666}}

[[File:Spider-Island The Amazing Spider-Girl Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Spider-Girl battles Sisterhood of the Wasp mutated minions]]
Anya later aided the [[Avengers]], the [[New Avengers]], the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], and the [[Future Foundation]] with her allies in taking down the two-hundred Spider-Man imposters in Bryant Park on Manhattan.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 670}}

During the events of Spider-Island, Anya was attacked by agents of the Sisterhood after school and fled by web-swinging to get her friend Rocky to safety. Explaining her time as Araña battling the Sisterhood, she was confronted by the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] and found that [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Wilson Fisk]] wanted to team up with her. While she initially refused, Madam Web (Julia Carpenter) came to Spider-Girl later and told her that she must ally herself with her enemies. Reluctantly, she agreed to work with Wilson Fisk given the danger at hand, who ordered a squadron of ninjas from the Hand under her command. With this group, she attempted to stop the Wasps from killing off the spiders infected citizens.{{r|Spider-Island: The Amazing Spider-Girl #1}}

However, Spider-Girl later realized that Madam Web had meant for her to team up with the Wasps, and slow down the Spiders, so that a cure could be found. Eventually, the Spiders were defeated and a cure was administered to everyone in the city, including Anya. However, she seemed to have retained her powers despite being "cured," suggesting she was not given the real cure or she was immune to the antidote.{{r|Spider-Island: The Amazing Spider-Girl #3}}

===With the Avengers===
She was recruited into the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]].{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 21|23}}

When a [[Inhumanity|massive Terrigen cloud began spreading across the Earth]], Anya turned to the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] for help in rescuing two Terrigen Cocoons. Spider-Girl and her allies soon realized they were caught in a war between [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|AIM]] and [[June Covington (Earth-616)|Toxie Doxie]], a mad geneticist whose deal with AIM had turned sour. Unable to fight AIM given the technocracy's current diplomatic immunity, the Avengers and Anya were forced to move carefully.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 21}} Anya spent much of the time learning how to operate with the Avengers and also received a new costume.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 22.INH}} In the end Spider-Girl rescued the cocoons and took down Toxie Doxie.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 23|25}}

===Conflict with the Inheritors===
Spider-Girl became Jessica Drew's protégé, and joined the Multiversal [[Spider-Army (Multiverse)|Spider-Army]] when the [[Inheritors (Earth-001)|Inheritors]] threatened to destroy every [[Spider-Verse|Spider from all realities]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 9|10}}

[[File:Spider-Verse Team-Up Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|175px|As an agent of the [[Spider-Army (Multiverse)|Spider-Army]]]]
Her abilities were indispensable for the Spider-Army as her involvement helped discover the Inheritors' plan, thus utilizing her powers and relationship with the Spider Society allowed her to read their scrolls, deducing how best to defeat and banish the Inheritors.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 11}}

Some time later, when Superior Octopus used Inheritor Technology to create more clone bodies, the Web-Warriors could not prevent the Inheritors from using that same technology [[Spider-Geddon|to escape their prison on a desolate Earth]].{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 1}} Anya joined with [[May Parker (Earth-982)|Mayday Parker]] and the duo sought out [[Anna-May Parker (Earth-18119)|Spiderling]] and her parents on [[Earth-18119]]; helping to fight the [[Vulture Gang (Earth-18119)|Vulture Gang]], then [[Brix (Earth-001)|Brix]] and [[Bora (Earth-001)|Bora]], and curing a six-armed [[Norman Osborn II (Earth-18119)|Normie Osborn]]. While Mayday and Annie bond discovering themselves sisters, Anya learned from mystic scrolls that Annie is the totem Pattern Maker, who could change the Great Web for their needs.{{r|Spider-Girls Vol 1 1|3}}

The trio reunite with the rest of the Spider-Army, with armor crafted from the Great Web itself and defeated the Inheritors, who were then turned into babies cleansed of their totemic appetite.{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 5}}

===Order of the Web===
[[File:Miles Morales (Earth-1610), Julia Carpenter (Earth-616), Gwendolyn Stacy (Earth-65), Anya Corazon (Earth-616), Cindy Moon (Earth-616) and Jessica Drew (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 44 001.jpg|right|thumb||175px|Anya and the others share a dark vision]]
After sharing a vision of Peter Parker painfully dying from a disfigured and bandaged [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|demon]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 44}} [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Julia Carpenter]] explained the Great Web drew Spider-Man into conflict with Sin-Eater, who marched an army on Ravencroft Institute to end Norman Osborn. As Sin-Eater's victims resurrect as innocent people, having Osborn go through that seemed a positive. However, other [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|spider]] [[Gwendolyn Stacy (Earth-65)|heroes]] could not convince Peter to let Sin-Eater do so, potentially saving innumerable lives in the future, so Anya joined her [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|fellow]] [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Spiders]] to stop Peter from saving Osborn.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 48}}

She became a founding member of the [[Order of the Web (Earth-616)|Order of the Web]] with the other spider heroes to save Peter from Norman, after the temporary abatement of Sin-Eater.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: The Sins of Norman Osborn Vol 1 1}} While escaping, Anya saw Norman's antagonism with Peter about Gwen cause him to lose his cool, and tossed Norman out for Sin-Eater as they escaped.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 49}} From Peter's sacrifice of Norman sealing a deal with Kindred, Anya and the Order were possessed in consequence by a demon sent by Kindred to destroy Peter,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 50.LR}} pursuing the veteran Spider-Man to the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 50}}

Under the control of Kindred, the Order began wrecking havoc across the city and even battling the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 51.LR}} Arriving at the Brooklyn Bridge they attacked innocent bystanders and were also harming themselves, forcing Peter to make a deal with the demon. Kindred accepted the deal and released the spider heroes from his control.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 52}} The confused heroes were then met by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] and Black Cat, as the sorcerer explained that they needed to collaborate in order to help Peter and they all ventured into the [[Astral Plane]], leaving Black Cat behind to guard their way back.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 52.LR}}

Traversing the devastated dreamscape, Anya and the other Spiders fought demons before Strange sent them through the exit portal to handle the situation in their place. Arriving at the Osborn cemetery, Spider-Girl fought alongside the Order against Sin-Eater, who recently took Morlun's powers. Saved by Julia's plan, she was with the others captured by Kindred and forced to attend "dinner" with Peter and Mary Jane. As the situation escalated and she was about to be killed, Mary Jane's attempted sacrifice and Norman Osborn's timely intervention freed her and the others. After their rescue, Anya and the Order debated events and tabled a plan against Kindred before moving to apprehend escaped criminals from Ravencroft.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 53.LR|54.LR}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 55|56}}

| Powers                  = '''Spider Physiology:''' Thanks to the events of [[Spider-Island (Event)|Spider-Island]] Anya possesses a copy of Spider-Man's powers following his encounter with the [[Adriana Soria (Earth-616)|Queen]], granted to her by exposure to the [[Miles Warren (Earth-616)|Jackal]]'s [[Spider-Virus]]. The radioactive spider bite was in essence recreated in her, the complex mutagenic enzymes in Spider-Man's blood were transferred triggering numerous body-wide mutagenic changes within, granting her superhuman strength, speed, toughened flesh, and possibly numerous unknown arachnid-like abilities.
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' Anya's strength is relatively large at her stage in heroism. Her strength may also be increasing because she was quickly able to subdue Arachne, who can lift 10 tons. however, following the events of Spider-Island, her strength has increased to a level comparable to Spider-Man's, if slightly less.
* '''Superhuman Speed:''' Anya can run and move at speeds that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete. She is ultimately capable of running at speeds in excess of 30 miles per hour.
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' Anya's body is physically tougher and more resistant to some types of injury than the body of a normal human. Her body is more resistant to impact forces than anything else. She can withstand great impacts, such as falling from a height of several stories or being struck by an opponent with super-strength, that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no discomfort and also, she is bulletproof.
* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Anya's advanced musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows her to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair her.
* '''Superhuman Agility:''' Anya's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are all enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete. Araña is extraordinarily limber and her tendons and connective tissues are twice as elastic as the average human being's, despite their enhanced strength.
* '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Anya's reflexes are similarly enhanced and are currently about 10 times greater than those of an ordinary human.
* '''Camouflage:''' She has the ability to hide in shadows, becoming invisible to the enemy, similar to crab spiders.{{r|Spider-Girl Vol 2 8}} {{r|Web Warriors Vol 1 3}}
* '''Wall-Crawling:''' She has the ability to cling to walls at will.
* '''Organic Webbing Generation:''' She has the ability to organically produce her own silk webbing from glands within her forearms, limited by her body's health and nutrition. These organic webs have many of the same properties as Spider-Man's artificial webbing. The silk is released through a spinneret near each wrist containing a central web spigot orifice used for web-slinging and draglines, supplemented by several radial minor spigots for other types of webs connected to specialized glands.

Araña is extraordinarily limber and her tendons and connective tissues are twice as elastic as the average human being's. 
* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Araña's advanced musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows her to exert herself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair her.
* '''Wall-Crawling:''' She had the ability to cling to walls.
* '''Carapace:''' She could summon a blue spider-like exoskeleton around her body that emanates from the tattoo on her upper right arm, enhancing her abilities and protecting her from damage. She could control the thickness, coverage, and shape of the carapace. At its thickest, it is resistant to small firearms. However, when using full armor, contact with water leaves her unable to breathe, forcing her to retract it.
* '''The Spirit of the Hunter:''' Anya possessed a spirit named "The Spirit of the Hunter". This spirit enhanced her abilities and puts her into a berserker-like state. Upon discovering that she was not a true hunter, she quits the WebCorp during a fight with a giant monster summoned by the Wasps and grants her Hunter abilities and the "Spirit of the Hunter" to Nina.
