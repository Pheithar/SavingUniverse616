| History                 = In the 1970s, Constance Molina was a reporter for numerous tabloids, specially focusing on sightings of metahumans.

When she, Lucas and Brashear arrived to the morgue where the body was being kept, they discovered [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]] fighting [[Kaluu (Earth-616)|Kaluu]]. The fight was stopped, and as they began investigating, [[Bear (Hybrid) (Earth-616)|the Bear]] appeared, and presented herself as the killer of that creature, in self-defense, as she wanted to prevent the [[Vampires|Deathwalkers]] from using it for a sacrifice.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 11}}

The Bear explained that she herself was the result of a failed attempt of the Deathwalkers to extinguish humanity in 1908, and that they would try to do it again. With the mystery solved, the people present formed the [[Mighty Avengers (1970s) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]], and went to find the Deathwalkers. Kaluu tracked down the magic they used in the were-bat to a secret subway below the City Hall. The Mighty Avengers then attacked the Deathwalkers before they could make their sacrifice. After [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]] recovered the Talisman of Kamar-Taj, which was required to perform the sacrifice, [[Adam Brashear (Earth-616)|Adam Brashear]] caused the subway to collapse above the Deathwalkers. With the Deathwalkers stopped, the team disbanded.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 12}} 

In the present day, Constance and Kaluu returned to New York City in order to contact [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]]'s [[Mighty Avengers (Infinity) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]],{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 11}} and inform them that the Deathwalkers had returned.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 12}}
