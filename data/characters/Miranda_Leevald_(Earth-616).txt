| History                 = Miranda grew up in a Texas trailer park and was popular at school until her mutant powers manifested.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 9}}<!--The handbook reference should be replace when possible--> With no job skills and no money to support herself, she had to take a route to survive: sex work. She used her mutant abilities for her benefit, first on the streets and later when she was scouted by [[Madame Drache (Earth-616)|Madame Drache]] of the [[X-Ranch]].{{citation}}

Soon the congregates and leaders of the mutant-hating [[Church of Humanity (Earth-616)|Church of Humanity]] attacked the mutant brothel and burned it to the ground. The [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] arrived and rescued her. Stacy joined the X-Men.{{citation}}

Stacy soon had to confront the Church members who eagerly sought her demise. During one of her first missions, Stacy was accidentally teleported by a member of the Church to their cathedral headquarters. The X-Men arrived and rescued her before any harm could be done by the Church and its leader the [[Supreme Pontiff (Earth-616)|Supreme Pontiff]].{{citation}}

Instead of using her mutant pheromones to ply an illicit trade, she made practical use of them, allowing the X-Men to gain ground on those who would do harm.{{citation}}

During her membership with the X-Men she tried to seduce members [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]] and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]].{{citation}} After a few missions she quit the team, and left behind a video of herself jumping rope naked for Archangel.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 422}}

===M-Day and New Warriors===
She lost her mutant powers due to [[M-Day]] and returned to the streets and sex work. Stacy was very depressed by losing her powers.{{r|Generation M Vol 1 2}}
[[File:Miranda Leevald (Earth-616) from New Warriors Vol 4 4 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|As Ripcord.]]

She was recruited into [[Dwayne Taylor (Earth-616)|Night Thrasher]]'s newest incarnation of the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]]. Her skin condition was cleared up and she was given a suit with built-in tentacles, presumably made of steel or a harder metal. She was apparently killed during a confrontation with [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Superhuman Restraint Unit (Earth-616)|Cape Killers]].{{r|New Warriors Vol 4 16}}

===Vengeance===
However, she appeared again at a club with [[Sugar Kane (Earth-616)|Sugar Kane]] and the [[Ultimate Nullifier (Teen Brigade) (Earth-616)|Ultimate Nullifier]], alive and apparently repowered.{{r|Vengeance Vol 1 1}}

She was later seen partying in [[Doomstadt]], just before the [[Young Masters (Earth-616)|Young Masters]]' attack.{{r|Vengeance Vol 1 6}}

===Seeking Support===
Stacy X attended the first meeting of the [[Mindfulness of Mutant Appearances (Earth-616)|Mindfulness of Mutant Appearances]], a support group set up by [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] for mutants unable to pass as normal humans. After fellow attendee [[Briquette (Earth-616)|Briquette]] took issue with the normal-looking Stacy X's presence, Stacy X revealed that her previous appearance as repowered was really her using makeup to imitate her former scaly appearance and that she had been seeking a reason to live since the loss of her powers, hoping that this group would be just that. Briquette apparently reconciled with and embraced Stacy X as the meeting closed.{{r|Domino Annual Vol 1 1}}

===Krakoa===
At some point afterwards, Stacy X joined the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] and regained her powers.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 3}}

She began operating in the Bower, a place where people who don't know how they fit into Krakoa go to find a release for their frustrations. She also runs a daycare for abandoned mutant babies.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 3}}

| Powers                  = '''Pheromone Control:''' Stacy X is sensitive to pheromone emissions. She secretes her own pheromones upon skin-to-skin contact, allowing her to stimulate body functions in others to cause orgasms, vomiting, nausea, rectal malfunctions, etc. This power was seen to work much like [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]]'s absorption power, as seen when [[Jared Corbo (Earth-616)|Radius]]' forcefield nullified her pheromone control. She is able to heal others by speeding up their healing process, and can increase their stamina so that they won't tire easily, giving her teammates rushes of adrenaline.{{citation}} After regaining her powers, she acquired the ability to launch her pheromones into the air and influence people without making direct contact them.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 3}}

'''Scaled-Skin:''' She has snake-like, scaly skin that give her an unknown degree of durability.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 9}}

| Abilities               = Stacy is an expert fighter with some martial arts abilities,{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 9}} capable of challenging even [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], and defeat him while laughing.{{citation}}
