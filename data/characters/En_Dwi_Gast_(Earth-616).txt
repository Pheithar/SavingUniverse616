===Early Life===
The true origins of En Dwi Gast, like all [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elders of the Universe]], have been lost in time due to being one of the oldest living beings in the [[Earth-616|universe]]. What is known is that he was the last survivor of a race which evolved just after the [[Glossary:Big Bang|Big Bang]]. Because the Elders are each the last surviving members of their respective species, they consider each other to be siblings; often referring to each other as brother or sister. The Elders all have extended lifespans that were gained through a single-minded obsession with various hobbies. In En Dwi Gast's case, that obsession is playing games.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 5}}

Whereas most Elders held monopoly over their respective obsession, En Dwi shared his hobby with [[Challenger (Elder of the Universe) (Earth-616)|one of his brothers]], with whom he grew close. When the other Elders started going by aliases that reflected their passion, En Dwi's friend decided to call himself "the Grandmaster." Since there could only be one Grandmaster, the Grandmaster and En Dwi's relationship escalated into a rivalry. They eventually decided to play one last game, despite the Grandmaster's reluctance, after which the loser would be barred from reality until its end. The Grandmaster lost and was exiled, and En Dwi Gast took on his alias for himself.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 679}}

The new Grandmaster spent his long life searching out new forms of amusement through the playing of games. He studied millions of worlds and the many forms of games they play, while mastering them every time. He used his great power to arrange contests and tournaments with willing and unwilling volunteers. He challenged these opponents to some of the highest stakes in the universe and if they won, he would always keep his word.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 5}} En Dwi Gast eventually had a [[Va Nee Gast (Earth-616)|daughter]], who grew up by his side, observing and learning while exploring the cosmos and playing games with his father.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684}}

===Visit to Earth-712===
The Grandmaster once traveled through the [[Multiverse]] and found [[Earth-712]], home of the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Squadron Supreme]], where he planned a contest against the [[Nathaniel Richards (Scarlet Centurion) (Earth-6311)|Scarlet Centurion]]. They each chose a team of champions to do combat. The Grandmaster used the Squadron Supreme and the Scarlet Centurion formed the [[Institute of Evil (Earth-712)|Institute of Evil]]. The Grandmaster won the contest and decided to create his own version of the Squadron to be his pawns in future games.{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 1 9}}

[[File:En Dwi Gast (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 69 001.jpg|thumb|left|Appearing before Kang]]
===Challenging Kang===
Upon returning to [[Earth-616]] the Grandmaster transformed three men, Kinji Obatu, Kyle Richmond, and James Sanders, into [[Kinji Obatu (Earth-616)|Doctor Spectrum]], [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]], and the [[James Sanders (Earth-616)|Whizzer]], respectively. He also created his own [[Hyperion (Grandmaster's Creation) (Earth-616)|Hyperion]] out of nothing but matter. He dubbed his new team the [[Squadron Sinister (Earth-616)|Squadron Sinister]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 69}}

He then traveled to the [[Earth-6311|31st Century]], the home of [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]]. Kang was lamenting the loss of his beloved [[Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-6311)|Ravonna]], wishing he had the power over life and death.  The Grandmaster suddenly appeared and offered Kang such power. All Kang had to do was beat the Grandmaster in a game. If Kang lost, however, the Grandmaster would destroy Kang and his Earth. The Grandmaster gave Kang one year to prepare. In that time Kang kidnapped the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] to serve as his pawns.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 69}}

The Grandmaster set his Squadron Sinister against four Avengers, [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Goliath]], in four simultaneous 1v1 matches, each occurring at a different landmark across the globe: the [[Statue of Liberty]], the [[Taj Mahal]], [[Big Ben (Clock)|Big Ben]], and the [[Sphinx]]. The first three matches were won by the Avengers, but the fourth, between Goliath and the Whizzer at Big Ben, was interrupted by the [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]]. The Grandmaster considered this to be a breach of the rules and teleported the Avengers and the Squadron back to Kang's time. Black Knight, confused by the events that just transpired, vowed to rescue his fellow heroes from the Grandmaster's clutches.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 70}}

In the second round, Kang sent the remaining Avengers, [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]], [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], and [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]], back in time to 1941 to do battle with the Grandmaster's replacement champions, the [[Invaders (Earth-616)|Invaders]]; Captain America, [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]], and the [[Human Torch (Android) (Earth-616)|Human Torch]]. The Invaders and Avengers clashed until the Vision took down all three Invaders, earning the Avengers a victory in their sponsors' game. Meanwhile, Black Knight managed to make his way to the 31st Century from the present and free the other Avengers.

With the game concluded, the Grandmaster agreed to give Kang his prize. However, because the first round ended in a stalemate, the Grandmaster could only give Kang half of it, asking Kang if he would rather have the power to either give life or to take it. Kang was about to chose the power of life before the Avengers burst in the room demanding to be sent back to their home time. Enraged, Kang asked the Grandmaster for the power of death to the Avengers, which the Grandmaster granted. Kang then effortlessly took out the Avengers. As he stood gloating over their almost lifeless bodies, Black Knight attacked and downed Kang with a single blow. Perplexed, Black Knight asked the Grandmaster why Kang went down so easily if he had been given such ultimate power. The Grandmaster stated that he had given Kang the power to kill the Avengers, and that Black Knight was not yet an Avenger. The Grandmaster returned Black Knight and the Avengers to their home time, and departed to seek out new games to play as well as new galaxies to conquer.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 71}}

===The Defenders===
At some point after the Grandmaster returned to the present, the [[Prime Mover (Earth-616)|Prime Mover]], a robot designed to manipulate [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents for [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]'s amusement, launched itself into space to seek out new games to play. The Prime Mover randomly sent out signals to find others to play with. One of these signals was answered by the Grandmaster. The two devised a game similar to the one the Grandmaster played with Kang. If the Prime Mover won, he would be granted the power to enslave the Earth. If the Grandmaster won, he would allow the planet to go free as he had no interest in it. The Grandmaster wished to use the [[Squadron Sinister (Earth-616)|Squadron Sinister]] again but could only find [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]]. Probing his mind, the Grandmaster learned of the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] and decided to use them instead. Lacking the agreed upon six pieces per side, Nighthawk was sent to recruit [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]].

[[File:En Dwi Gast (Earth-616) from Giant-Size Defenders Vol 1 3 001.jpg|thumb|right|The Grandmaster and the Defenders]]
The six heroes were divided into teams of two and sent to one of three planets to fight the Prime Mover's champions. The first round was won by Nighthawk and [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]], Daredevil and [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] were killed on a volcanic planet in the second, and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] and the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] won the third. After claiming victory and restoring Namor and Daredevil to life, the Grandmaster reneged on his deal, declaring that he would turn the Earth into a breeding ground for his future pawns. The Defenders rushed to attack but they were easily repelled by the Grandmaster's power. Daredevil proposed that he and the Grandmaster play another game, a simple coin toss, for double or nothing. If the Grandmaster won, he would get the Earth plus the moon, but if he lost, he had to keep his original promise and leave the Earth alone. Tossing an improvised coin, Daredevil called heads and the Grandmaster called tails. Using his heightened senses, Daredevil correctly guessed the coin would land on heads. The Grandmaster accepted defeat, sent Daredevil and the Defenders back to Earth, and left for the stars once more.{{r|Giant-Size Defenders Vol 1 3}}

===Contest of Champions===
<!-- Plagiarism: Grandmaster on Marvel.com -->
Although he can resurrect living beings after their deaths, the Grandmaster could not revive the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]] when he was killed. As a result, he soon challenged the entity [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]] to a contest. If he won, his "brother" would be brought back, but if he lost he would die as well.{{r|Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions Vol 1 1}} They selected teams from Earth for that which would become known as the [[Contest of Champions]]. Some of the heroes chosen included  [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]], [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]], [[Eternals (Race)|Eternals]], [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]], [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], [[Soviet Super-Soldiers (Earth-616)|Soviet Super Soldiers]], [[Heroes for Hire (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]] and the [[Rangers (Earth-616)|Rangers]].{{r|Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions Vol 1 2}} His team was triumphant, but Death revealed the true terms of the game; that he would have to give his own life in order to save his brother's. Due to his strict code of honor and gamesmanship, he agreed and the Collector returned to life. Death then challenged the Collector to a contest with the Grandmaster's return to life as the stakes.{{r|Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions Vol 1 3}}

<!-- Plagiarism: Grandmaster on Marvel.com -->
The Collector sent the West Coast Avengers and Silver Surfer to stop the Grandmaster from handing over the lives of the east coast Avengers to Death. Even though the West Coasters prevailed, the contest proved to be intended as a distraction, allowing the Grandmaster to ensnare Death.{{r|West Coast Avengers Annual Vol 1 2}} The Grandmaster then used the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and an incarnation of the [[Legion of the Unliving (Kang) (Earth-616)|Legion of the Unliving]] in another contest for the fate of the universe, in which he lost due to trickery on the part of Hawkeye. As a result, Death brought back the Avengers to Earth alive and well.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 16}}

===Killing Galactus===
<!-- Plagiarism: Grandmaster on Marvel.com -->
In later years, the Elders of the Universe planned to destroy [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] with the [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Gems]], thus causing the existing universe to collapse.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 4|10}} The Elders would then survive both the big crunch and the subsequent big bang of a new universe, which would then result in the Elders becoming Galactus-like beings in the new universe.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 17|19}} However, this plan failed and the Elders were soon confronted by an Infinity Gem seeking Thanos. The Grandmaster lost one of the gems in the process, and Thanos gained ultimate power shortly thereafter.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 58|61}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 64}}

===Thanos Quest===
Following this the Grandmaster took possession of the [[Mind Stone|Mind Gem]]. He held it for a time until the Mad Titan, [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]], came to bargain for it. The Mad Titan planned to challenge the Grandmaster to a game, of which Thanos easily won. The Grandmaster, however, broke his main rule and cheated, but so did Thanos. It was revealed that it was not the real Thanos but a recreation created from the [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Gems]]. The recreation then took the stone and left him trapped in the game.{{r|Thanos Quest #2}}

===Galactic Marathon===
The Grandmaster made a wager during the "Galactic Marathon" held by the [[Gilpetperdon (Earth-616)|Runner]]. He soon recruited the fastest beings in the galaxy to compete; [[Makkari (Earth-616)|Makkari]], [[Buried Alien (Earth-TRN242)|Fastforward]], [[Fooferah (Earth-616)|Fooferah]], [[Figillulli (Earth-616)|Figillulli]], [[Startanious (Earth-616)|Startanious]], [[Duntumbla (Earth-616)|Duntumbla]], [[Huyenneyuh (Earth-616)|Huyenneyuh]], [[Gzoom (Earth-616)|Gzoom]], and [[Miximixim (Earth-616)|Miximixim]], with Makkari winning, much to the annoyance of the Grandmaster, who lost money betting on Runner. Makkari was however stuck at superspeed and the Grandmaster offered to help, in exchange for him becoming his champion at the "Pangalactic Marathon", and finally the race for the championship of all known space. Makkari, however, refused.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 58}}

===Justice League vs. The Avengers===
Grandmaster encountered a being from the [[DC Universe|another universe]] known as [[w:c:dc:Krona (New Earth)|Krona]]. He came to [[Earth-616]] trying to learn more about the origin of creation. The Grandmaster decided there was only one way to beat him by challenging him to a contest. If Krona won, he would reveal to him the name of the being born before the Big Bang.{{r|JLA/Avengers Vol 1 1}} They pitted their best heroes against each other, forcing the [[w:c:dc:Justice League of America (New Earth)|Justice League]] to battle the Avengers.{{r|JLA/Avengers Vol 1 2}} They took part in a galactic "scavenger hunt'" for 12 powerful items. Krona however turned against the Grandmaster when he lost, allowing to learn of [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] in the process. He then took down both Galactus and the Grandmaster.{{r|JLA/Avengers Vol 1 3}}  But the Grandmaster used the items collected by the heroes to merge the two universes trapping Krona in between. After he was defeated, the Universes returned to normal.{{r|JLA/Avengers Vol 1 4}}

===UltraForce vs. The Avengers===
The Grandmaster challenged [[Nemesis (Cosmic Being) (First Cosmos)|Nemesis]] a being from [[Earth-93060]] to a contest pitting the Avengers against [[UltraForce (Earth-93060)|UltraForce]].{{r|Avengers/UltraForce Vol 1 1}}
<!-- 
===Morwen===
The Grandmaster sensed that [[Morwen (Earth-616)|Morwen]], First Sorceress of Chaos, had returned to Earth and had taken, as a host, [[Tess Black (Earth-616)|Tess Black]], the daughter of the trickster god, [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 503}}
 -->
===Squadron Sinister vs. Thunderbolts===
[[File:Thunderbolts Vol 1 102 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Vs. The Thunderbolts]]
The Grandmaster reunited the Squadron Sinister, sending the new female [[Alice Nugent (Earth-616)|Doctor Spectrum]] to recruit [[James Sanders (Earth-616)|Speed Demon]]. Speed Demon accepted and quit the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]]. Former [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defender]] (and former original member of the Squadron Sinister) [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]] was offered membership into the Thunderbolts by Songbird.{{r|New Thunderbolts Vol 1 16}} Baron Zemo then resumed control of the consolidated team, while [[Janice Yanizeski (Earth-616)|Joystick]] revealed she was working for the Grandmaster, attacking Speed Demon.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 102|107}}

[[File:Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616) from Hulk Vol 2 12.jpg|thumb|left]]
===Defenders vs. Offenders===
The Collector made a bet with the Grandmaster wherein they would both create a team to battle each other. The Grandmaster had the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] and the Collector had the [[Offenders (Earth-616)|Offenders]]. The Defenders won and the Collector complied with the terms of the bet and gave them [[Jarella (Earth-616)|Jarella]]'s body. The Red Hulk apparently killed the Grandmaster, but as Death itself has barred all Elders from her realm, it is yet to be revealed what the true status of the Grandmaster truly is.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 10|12}}

===Dazzler===
The Grandmaster developed a crush on the [[Homo superior|Mutant]] singer [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]]. To get her attention, he arranged a roller derby against a group of villains. [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]] were also forced to compete as well. Dazzler refused the Grandmaster's advances as well as his warped sense of a relationship and sent the cosmic being packing. The Grandmaster then left Earth rejected.{{r|X-Men: To Serve and Protect #4}}

===Deadpool Corps===
The Grandmaster and the [[Tryco Slatterus (Earth-616)|Champion]] came into conflict with the [[Deadpool Corps (Multiverse)|Deadpool Corps]], a team of Deadpools from alternate universes.{{r|Deadpool Corps Vol 1 1}} The Corps was founded by [[Earth-616]]'s [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] after he was chosen by the [[Tath Ki (Earth-616)|Contemplator]] in stopping a cosmic entity known as the [[Awareness (Earth-616)|Awareness]] that devours the [[Multiverse]]'s consciousness.{{r|Prelude to Deadpool Corps Vol 1 5}} The Grandmaster did not see them as worthy heroes and decided to test them. Fortunately, the Corps proved their worth by tricking the Champion two times in a row into becoming stranded on a planet. With help from the [[Broken Blade (Earth-616)|Broken Blade]], the Corps annihilated the entity who turns out to be a little alien that was the lone survivor of his species after the Big Bang.{{r|Deadpool Corps Vol 1 12}}

===The New Contest of Champions===
Following the temporary death of the [[Multiverse]],{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 1|9}} the Elders of the Universe discovered the reality where the Multiversal renewal began; [[Earth-15513|a broken dimension]] where the remains of a planet named [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]] floated as the broken shell of what once was everything that remained of the Multiverse, formerly controlled by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]. Due to it being the epicenter of a newly created Multiverse, this dimension became rich in a powerful substance known as [[Neutronium|Iso-8]]. The Elders of the Universe resolved to fight for its concentrated and most powerful form, the [[ISO-Sphere]], and decided to use the remains of this universe as an arena for the new Contest of Champions, the Battlerealm. Each Elder abducted a contestant from across the Multiverse to fight to death on their behalf.

[[File:En Dwi Gast (Earth-616) from Contest of Champions Vol 1 6 001.png|thumb|right|With a portion of the Iso-Sphere]]
When the Contest of Champions drew to a close, only the Collector's and the Grandmaster's competitors remained, [[Bruce Banner (Earth-69413)|Maestro]] and the [[Jacob Gallows (Earth-928)|Punisher]], respectively, and the other Elders had returned back to Earth-616 with their hands empty. Before the final battle, Maestro suggested the two Elders a new game mode to keep them both entertained. Maestro and Punisher were to become their master's summoners, and would choose teams of new players from across the Multiverse to fight in their and the Elder's behalf. This plan hadn't been devised only for survival, as Maestro and the Punisher began working together to take down the Collector and the Grandmaster, and the new contest was part of their plan.{{r|Contest of Champions Vol 1 6}} With each battle waged between the two teams, the winner Elder would acquire a percentage of the other's portion of the ISO-Sphere.{{r|Contest of Champions Vol 1 6}}

As contestants entered and left the game, the Collector remained with most of the ISO-Sphere, while the Grandmaster was left with a sliver that barely made him powerful. During a final all-or-nothing match for the ISO-Sphere, Maestro and Punisher betrayed the people they had summoned and took them down.{{r|Contest of Champions Vol 1 5}} Maestro subsequently teleported to Grandmaster's HQ, and managed to defeat him due to the Grandmaster barely possessing any of the ISO-Sphere's power. The two portions of the ISO-Sphere desired to be with each other, but were prevented in doing so only by their owner's will. In a battle of minds, Maestro over trumped the Collector's desire to possess the ISO-Sphere and acquired its entirety. With entire control over the ISO-Sphere, Maestro cast out the Collector and the Grandmaster from the Battlerealm.{{r|Contest of Champions Vol 1 6}}

===The Challenger's Return===
The destruction and rebirth of the universe gave the exiled former Grandmaster an opening to return to reality. Yearning for a rematch after spending eons trapped in the void of nothingness, he approached the Grandmaster to duel, and adopted the alias of Challenger.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 679}} The rematch took the form of a contest between teams of warriors assembled by the Grandmaster and the Challenger to fight on their behalf; the [[Lethal Legion (Grandmaster) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]] and the [[Black Order (Earth-616)|Black Order]], respectively. The Earth was chosen as the battleground for this competition, so its heroes could act as unwitting obstacles for its duration.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 676}} Additionally, the entire planet was teleported from the Solar System to a distant galaxy that could serve as a neutral space.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 687}} As part of his strategy, the Grandmaster used his daughter as a secret agent in the game, making her pose as a member of the Avengers named [[Voyager]]. The Grandmaster granted her the power of teleportation to an extent that it allowed her to manipulate the memories of the heroes so that they believed her to be one of their own.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684}}

[[File:Grandmaster's Cosmic Game Room from Avengers Vol 1 684 001.jpg|thumb|left|The Grandmaster and the Challenger during the rematch]]
On each round, the teams had to fight to secure a pair of [[Pyramoids]] deployed somewhere in the planet by the gamemasters.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 677}} Whoever touched a Pyramoid scored a point for their team, and was teleported to the Grandmaster's Cosmic Game Room, though in such a violent way it seemed like they were disintegrated. They were then placed in stasis inside crystals.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 679}} On the first round, the Pyramoids were claimed by the Black Order's [[Black Dwarf (Earth-616)|Black Dwarf]] and, unexpectedly, the Avengers' [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 678}} In the second round, one of the Pyramoids was seized by the Lethal Legion's [[Ferene (Earth-616)|Ferene]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 681}} and the other by the Avengers' [[Red Wolf (Earth-51920)|Red Wolf]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 682}}

With the game at a draw, the Grandmaster placed the final Pyramoid in [[Lenox Hill Hospital]], from where it was teleported to the [[Avengers Auxiliary Headquarters]] by Voyager.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 683}} However, in a sudden turn of events, Voyager rebelled against her father, while refusing to continue acting as a pawn for his games,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684}} thus putting the Grandmaster's victory at risk.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 685}} The Challenger's own ace-in-the-hole, the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], rampaged to the Avengers Auxiliary Headquarters, but destroyed the Pyramoid when it was within his grasp, committing a foul and costing the Challenger a point. However, the Challenger observed as Voyager confessed to the Avengers. Enraged by the Grandmaster's deception, the Challenger disintegrated him{{r|Avengers Vol 1 686}} and went on a rampage on Earth after sabotaging the [[World-Engine]] that sustained the planet's conditions.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 688}}

Due to his nature as an Elder, the Grandmaster recovered from his apparent demise just as a group of Avengers had entered the Cosmic Game Room to stabilize the World-Engine. The Avenger [[Miguel Santos (Earth-616)|Lightning]] tried to stop the Grandmaster from abandoning the fate of the Earth and resorted to challenging him to a game of poker. Lightning kept rising the stakes from the freedom of his teammates trapped in crystals, to his own life and the safety of Earth. Eventually, he bet his own history, arguing that like Voyager, the Grandmaster could alter people's memories to make them forget his existence. The Grandmaster couldn't bear the thought of paying the same price if he lost, and decided to fold. After the Avengers had defeated the Challenger back on Earth, the Grandmaster returned the planet to its proper location.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 689}}

| Powers                  = '''Power Primordial:''' The Power Primordial is residual energy left over from the Big Bang that created the current Marvel Universe. The Grandmaster is the last member of his race and he, like all other Elders, maintains his powers and himself through monomaniacal obsessions, with his being games. Like all Elders, the Grandmaster has purposely channeled the energies of the Power Primordial through countless years of training. In the case of the Grandmaster, he has channeled the Power Primordial for an all around effect such as granting himself superhuman physical, mental, and energy manipulative capabilities.{{r|Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide Vol 1 1}}
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' The Grandmaster possesses some degree of superhuman strength, the limits of which aren't clearly defined. However, the upper limit of his strength does not exceed 25 tons.{{r|Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide Vol 1 1}}
* '''Superhuman Speed:''' The Grandmaster can run and move at speeds that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete.{{r|Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide Vol 1 1}}

* '''Superhuman Durability:''' The Grandmaster's body is virtually invulnerable to physical injury.

As a result, the Grandmaster cannot be killed by any means. Although he can sustain physical injury, no injury can threaten his continued existence. The Grandmaster is also completely immune to all diseases and the aging process. Prior to being banished by Death, the Grandmaster was still functionally immortal in the sense that he was immune to aging and disease and he could rapidly regenerate almost any damaged bodily tissue. He also doesn't require food, water, or even air to breathe and can survive indefinitely in a complete vacuum.{{r|Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide Vol 1 1}}

* '''Superhuman Intellect:''' The Grandmaster has devoted much of his time into channeling the Power Primordial to increase his intellect over the millenia. As a result, his intellect is vastly superior to those of an ordinary human. He is a genius in all scientific fields and has created technology far surpassing that of Earth's current level of technology.{{r|Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide Vol 1 1}}
* '''Psionics:''' The Grandmaster also possesses vast psionic powers including telepathy and telekinesis. He can use his telepathy to read the thoughts of most other beings, control their actions, erase memories, create false memories, or fire mental bolts to stun a being into unconsciousness. He can also move and manipulate objects with his mind, even if the object is extremely heavy, with little to no effort.{{r|Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide Vol 1 1}}
* '''Energy Manipulation:''' The Grandmaster has also devoted much of the Power Primordial into granting him the ability to manipulate vast amounts of energy for a variety of purposes. The most common of those purposes includes the projection of immensely powerful blasts of concussive energy, heat, and cold. He can use his powers to literally resurrect dead beings no matter how badly damaged or dispersed they might be. He can also use these powers to restore to full life beings that are on the verge of death. He can bestow this power over life and death to mortal beings, though only for a few minutes. The Grandmaster can also molecularly manipulate the matter of most objects, beings, and substance even over a global scale. The Grandmaster can also use his powers to teleport himself and others across galactic distances or to transverse space itself under his own power at faster than light speeds.{{r|Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide Vol 1 1}}
| Abilities               = '''Super-Genius Intelligence:''' The Grandmaster's great intellect affords him extensive expertise in all areas of science. He devotes most of his time, however, to planning and playing games by using less powerful beings as pawns. He has no skills as a combatant but the sheer scope of his abilities make him formidable in battle, though he loathes physical confrontation in and of itself.{{r|Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide Vol 1 1}}
| Strength                = 
| Weaknesses              = Since the Grandmaster is a true immortal, it isn't known if he does currently have any weaknesses. Prior to the Elder's being banished by Death, the Grandmaster's continued life and vitality was dependent upon his personal obsession of games. If he were to have willingly given up his obsession, it could have proven fatal.{{r|Marvel Avengers: The Ultimate Character Guide Vol 1 1}}
