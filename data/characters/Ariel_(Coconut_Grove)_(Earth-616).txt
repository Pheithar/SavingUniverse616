[[File:Ariel (Coconut Grove) (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 3 1 0001.gif|left|thumb|Ariel]]
===Origin===
Ariel was an [[alien]] from the planet housing the [[Coconut Grove]] and whose culture resembles an ultra-stereotypical night club scene.

She was able, using a trick of her species, to bend space and time using closable doors as focus-points for teleportation. She was also gifted in her family's power of persuasion,{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #3}} which was, in fact, a [[mutant|mutation]].

One of her relatives, also named [[Ariel (Coconut Grove, Male) (Earth-616)|Ariel]] was gifted as well, and used his teleporting ability to come to [[Earth]], where he used his persuasive powers to play con games, and ended up trapped by a witch in a tree, preventing him from escaping via teleportation due to the lack of doors. The event inspired [[William Shakespeare (Earth-616)|William Shakespeare]] who based [[Wikipedia:The Tempest|The Tempest]] eponymous character on him.{{r|Fallen Angels #7}}

===[[Fallen Angels (Earth-616)|Fallen Angels]]===
Since Ariel's people reached an evolutionary stagnation point, Ariel was sent by [[Unipar (Earth-616)|Unipar]] on a high-paying assignment to [[Earth]] to collect samples of [[Homo superior|mutants]] that the Coconut Grove's people could study to find the key of their genetic specificity.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #3}}

Ariel joined the [[Fallen Angels (Earth-616)|Fallen Angels]], a group of young runaways, thieves, and mutants led by the [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]] who lived at the [[Beat Street Club]].  She became friends with [[Chance (Fallen Angels) (Earth-616)|Chance]] and the two plotted to turn the rest of the team over to Ariel's people,{{r|Fallen Angels #6}} (Chance was promised a share of the profits).{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #3}} The group also recruited three cyborgs: [[Alphonsus Lefszycic (Earth-616)|Gomi]] and his lobsters [[Bill the Lobster (Earth-616)|Bill]] and [[Don the Lobster (Earth-616)|Don]] (this one also a mutant).{{r|Fallen Angels #3}}

Later, when Chance was fighting with streets robbers, she was saved by [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] but fled when Ariel arrived through a teleporting door, leaving Roberto behind.{{r|Fallen Angels #2}}

Roberto and [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]], along with a bunch of [[James Madrox (Fallen Angels) (Earth-616)|Madroxes]] (whose source was later revealed to be a rogue duplicate and not the [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|original Madrox]]) were all recruited.  They were soon followed by [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] and another [[James Madrox (Fallen Angels) (Earth-616)|Madrox]]. [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom-Boom]], already part of Vanisher's team, was also taken from [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] to the Beat Street Club by Ariel.{{r|Fallen Angels #3}}

After presentations, they traveled to [[Earth-78411|Dinosaur World]] to recruit [[Moon-Boy (Earth-78411)|Moon Boy]] and [[Devil Dinosaur (Earth-78411)|Devil Dinosaur]] as well, both [[mutants]] of their respective races.{{r|Fallen Angels #4}} The group was later rejoined by a [[James Madrox (Mutate Duplicate) (Earth-616)|mutated Madrox duplicate]] and the mutant lobster Don was crushed by Devil Dinosaur.{{r|Fallen Angels #5}}

Ariel started to fear that mutant killers such as the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] or [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] would find them before she could deliver to her bosses, and Chance started to have doubts about their mission. Vanisher thought that the mutation scrambling that happened for some time was caused by mutant hunters, Ariel teleported the group to Coconut Grove,{{r|Fallen Angels #6}} where she presented them to her people and [[Unipar (Earth-616)|Unipar]], only to learn that she was herself a mutant and was captured as well.{{r|Fallen Angels #7}} Ariel then helped her friends, who had given her a second chance, escaped, and Sunspot and Warlock departed, leaving [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] and [[James Madrox (Fallen Angels) (Earth-616)|Jamie Madrox]] to stay with the team. Even though she was an alien, Ariel had come to terms with her mutant genetics and continued to use her mutant ability to sweet talk others.{{r|Fallen Angels #8}}

===[[San Francisco]]===
[[File:Ariel (Coconut Grove) (Earth-616) from X-Men Legacy Vol 1 227.jpg|file|right|thumb|250px|Ariel with the X-Men]] 
She later moved to [[San Francisco]] when a [[Homo superior|mutant]] community [[Divided We Stand|established there]] around the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #3}}

After [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] declared [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] outlaws to be taken-in, Ariel was deputized as an X-Man by [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]],{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #3}} and aided in defending the mutant population from the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]] and [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] agents by transporting the lost and wounded to [[Graymalkin Industries|Graymalkin]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy #226}}

When [[Hope Abbott (Earth-616)|Trance]] had been tasered and left lying helpless in an alleyway, [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] saved her and, moments later, a doorway behind him began to glow. Ariel appeared, accompanied by [[Sidney Green (Earth-616)|Onyx]]. Since he didn't recognize her, Gambit questioned Ariel whether she was an X-Men and she answered that her membership was in her genetics.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #226}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy #227}}
However, when Ariel and Onyx returned through the teleportational doorway Trance had disappeared. This confused Ariel, who didn't want to be blamed for the accidental loss of Trance. Ariel also displayed a disregard, or ignorance, towards the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoo]], [[Irma Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Mindee]], who she called Candy.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #227}}

While living on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], Ariel was willing to assist in the [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club's]] scientific experiments, to bend space & break through dimensional walls. It transpired that it was Trance's powers that interfered with Ariel's spatial-bending and Ariel, therefore, acted as a disinterested guinea pig when the X-Men were desperately looking for a means to enter [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]]'s dimension and save [[Roxanne Washington (Earth-616)|Bling!]]. The X-Club warped Ariel's space-bending, causing her to open a door that opened behind her. When faced with her own rear, Ariel appeared more interested in the appearance of her jacket than in aiding the X-Men.

===[[Second Coming]]===
After the return of the mutant messiah, [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], and [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] to the [[Earth-616|mainstream]] timeline, [[Bastion (Earth-616)|Bastion]] and his members of the [[Human Council (Earth-616)|Human Council]] attacked them tirelessly. Cyclops made their safe passage to Utopia the X-Men's top priority while Bastion made Hope's demise his. Bastion systematically eliminated all of the teleporters from the X-Men's ranks and, after [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|William Stryker]] sent [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] to [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]], Ariel was sent to teleport the X-Men to Hope. While traveling by car with [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]], a missile was launched from a F-22 Raptor, by Bastion, destroying the car. Wolverine and X-23 survived, but Ariel perished according to [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] and Wolverine.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #235}}

===[[Schism (Event)|Schism]] and [[Regenesis (Event)|Regenesis]]===
[[File:Ariel (Coconut Grove) (Earth-616) from X-Men Legacy Vol 1 260 002.jpg|file|left|thumb|150px|Ariel back in action]]
During the fallout of Schism, [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] discovered that Ariel's power had allowed her to jump from the vehicle before it was destroyed. However, the destruction of the entry door had left her trapped in an interdimensional limbo, burning.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #259|260}}

This limbo was later linked to [[Korvus Rook'shir (Earth-616)|Korvus Rook'shir]]'s [[Phoenix Blade]] during his time on Earth. A team of X-Men was assembled to save Ariel, and the [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]] managed to heal her. She then seemingly joined the [[Jean Grey School For Higher Learning]], teleporting [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] and herself to the [[Westchester County|Westchester]] School ruins.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #259|260}}

===[[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers/X-Men Conflict]]===
She seemingly sided with the X-Men during the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers/X-Men war]], as she stayed in touch with Rogue and was her ride to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] during the Avengers' hunt.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #270}}

===Dawn of X===
She was later listed as an active member of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], presumably on [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|X of Swords Handbook Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = As other [[Coconut Grove]] aliens, 
Ariel can perform the following ability:
* '''Teleportation''': Ariel's teleportation powers as she is able to warp space-time around a two closed doors, bending the space to briefly connect the two when opening them: She can walk through a door at her starting point and walk through a different door even if they are at interplanetary distances. Those powers aren't based on a mutant or mutate state, but come from a specific use of physical knowledge and seem available to all her race, and even to other species, allegedly possible for anyone with "the right kind of hands and a good grounding in subjective physics".{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #3}}
** After her return, she is now seemingly able to generate inflamed doors, from whom she can teleport.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #260}} The exact origin of her new powers is unknown but seemingly related to the flaming limbo she was trapped in.

Ariel is also the sole known [[Coconut Grove]] [[Mutant]], granting her the following power:
* '''Superhuman Persuasion''': She has the ability to psionically{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 3 #1}}/telepathically influence and charm others with her speech, allowing her to make them doing, thinking, believing, forgetting or remembering within moments. That ability isn't purely mind control but also on her own acting skills, based on the sound of her voice and the choice of her words.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #3}}

| Trivia                  = {{cl|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 3 #1}} and {{cl|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 3 #3|#3}} mistakenly listed her as appearing in {{cl|Fallen Angels #1}}, instead of {{cl|Fallen Angels #2}}. This was corrected in {{cl|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #3}}.
