===Early Life===
David "D. W." Griffith operated his uncle's [[Gem Theater]] on [[Times Square]].{{r|Hero for Hire #2}} 

===Luke Cage===
He leased a 3rd story office to [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]]. Cage inflicted almost constant damage to the facility, including wrecking his theatre.{{r|Power Man #21}} However, Griffith remained a close friend to Luke. For a period of time in his life, Cage considered D.W. Griffith his only friend.

Griffith sometimes proved quite useful to Cage in his adventures. Griffith used his expertise of audio-visual equipment to let the residents of Security City know the true evil intentions of Cage's nemesis [[Gideon Mace (Earth-616)|Gideon Mace]].{{r|Power Man #23}} Later he valiantly attempted to free Cage from the hypnosis of the [[Circus of Crime (Earth-616)|Circus of Crime]].{{r|Power Man #25}}

D.W. was also a "film student,"{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #73}} and attempted to produce his own productions. Once Dave became somewhat depressed, he considered taking a lethal dose of Acid Z and jumping off the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. However, a mysterious stranger convinced him to be happy with his life, regardless of which stage it was presently in.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #88}}

===Mighty Avengers===
D.W. was contacted by Cage again when he formed the [[Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]], he asked him if they could use the Gem Theater as their base, to which he agreed.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 #4.INH}}
