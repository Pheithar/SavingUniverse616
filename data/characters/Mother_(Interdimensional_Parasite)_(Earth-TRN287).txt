| History                 = Mother is an interdimensional parasite that lurks in the [[Multiverse]], seeking out powerful beings and realities to feed on. She tethers herself to parents and begins to act overbearingly protective like a parent.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #2|#5}}

[[File:Mother (Interdimensional Parasite) (Multiverse) 02.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Mother assimilating the Kaplans]]
She made a deal with the trickster god [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]], who helped her arrive to [[Earth-616]] through a magical spell created by [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]], a young hero with potential of incredible power that Mother wanted to absorb.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 10}} She arrived in the form of [[Mary-Jo Altman (Earth-616)|Mrs. Altman]], the late adoptive mother of [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]], who was the person Wiccan was trying to bring back with the spell. She quickly took control of [[Jeff Kaplan (Earth-616)|Dr. Kaplan]] and [[Rebbecca Kaplan (Earth-616)|Mrs. Kaplan]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 1}}

After realizing Mother was not the real Mrs. Altman, they escaped and sought the help of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. Unfortunately, the Avengers were already at the thrall of Mother. Despite being joined by [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Kid Loki]]{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #2}} and [[America Chavez (Earth-616)|Miss America]],{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #3}} and later by [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Marvel Boy]],{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #4}} Wiccan and Hulkling were only successful in slowing Mother down. However, Mother continued to amass deceased parents and mindless mass to fight her battles.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #2|#4}} She disappeared when the team left New York, and the parents she controlled returned to normal. An interference caused by Loki in Wiccan's spell that summoned her didn't allow her to remain on Earth-616, causing her powers to be distance based. So as long as the Young Avengers didn't return to New York, she wouldn't be able to come back.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 5}}

A mysterious [[Patriot (Entity) (Earth-616)|entity]] dressed as [[Patriot]] helped Mother bring the Young Avengers to [[Earth-TRN287|her dimension]]. The teenage heroes were able to quickly escape, except Hulkling and [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|Prodigy]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 8}} Using numerous evil alternate versions of themselves as a distraction, the Young Avengers distracted Mother and saved Hulkling and Prodigy.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 9}}

Mother subsequently gained a new ally in the form of [[Leah (Construct) (Earth-616)|Leah]], a former friend of Loki. Leah had apparently joined forces with other former love interests of the Young Avengers, and managed to trick Hulkling into returning to New York City, allowing Mother to come back.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 10}} Once she did, she planned to unleash on the Earth all of the alternate versions of the Young Avengers the originals had used against her.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 11}}

Numerous teenage allies of the Young Avengers fended off Central Park from the invasion of alternate Young Avengers while the real ones confronted Mother and Leah's [[Young Avengers (Constructs) (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 12}} With the help of Hulkling's motivation, Wiccan tapped into the power of the Demiurge, the magic essence Mother wanted to feast upon, and destroyed her.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 13}}

Mother's power limits have not been completely defined, but she has demonstrated the following powers: 
* '''Shape-Shifting''': Mother is composed of extradimensional reformative tissue, which makes her very malleable and allows her to reform her body when destroyed. However, this material may not be very durable as it is frequently seen being smashed.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #2|#5}} It appears that Mother can only take the form of deceased parents, and likely only deceased parents of individuals with whom [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] comes in contact. Thus far Mother has taken the form of [[Mary-Jo Altman (Earth-616)|Mrs. Altman]],{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 1}} [[Jeff Kaplan (Earth-616)|Dr. Kaplan]], [[Rebbecca Kaplan (Earth-616)|Mrs. Kaplan]],[[Laufey (Earth-616)|Laufey]],{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 2}} [[America Chavez (Earth-616)|Miss America]]'s "Amerimoms",{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 3}} and [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Marvel Boy]]'s mother ([[Star Splendor (Earth-200080)|Star Splendor]]) and father ([[Captain Glory (Earth-200080)|Captain Glory]]).{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 4}} It was revealed that Mother can only take the form of deceased parents if she is near where they died. 
* '''Mental Manipulation''': Mother appears to exerted some type of mental hold upon adults. The extent and source of this power is unknown.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 2}}{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 4}}
* '''Matter Manipulation''': Mother can change ambient matter around her into either her extradimensional reformative tissue or rebuild destroyed structures.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 2}}
* '''Magical Immunity''': Each time [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] has attempted to cast a spell on Mother, he's become violently ill.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 2}}{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 4}}
* '''Pocket Dimension''': Mother can create a "strange comic panel-like dimension" to trap individuals.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 2}}<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=44500 Gillen MOTHERS the "Young Avengers"]</ref>

| Notes                   = * Mother appears to only be able to take the form of deceased parents, specifically the deceased parents of individuals with whom [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] comes in contact. Thus far Mother has taken the form of: 
** [[Mary-Jo Altman (Earth-616)|Mrs. Altman]],{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 1}} nurse and adoptive mother of [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]].
** [[Jeff Kaplan (Earth-616)|Dr. Kaplan]] & [[Rebbecca Kaplan (Earth-616)|Mrs. Kaplan]],{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 2}} original parents of [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]].
** [[Laufey (Earth-616)|Laufey]],{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 1}} & [[Gaea (Earth-616)|Gaea]],[[Freyja Freyrdottir (Earth-616)|Freyja]], and [[Idunn (Earth-616)|Idunn]],{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 10}} father and adoptive mothers of [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]].
** [[America Chavez (Earth-616)|Miss America]]'s "Amerimoms"{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 3}}
** [[Captain Glory (Earth-200080)|Captain Glory]] & [[Star Splendor (Earth-200080)|Star Splendor]],{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 4}} [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Marvel Boy]]'s mother and father.
** Mother did not assumed the form of Kate Bishop's mother, Eleanor. It was believed this was because Mother needs to be near the location of parents' death.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #4|5}} Subsequent stories would also reveal that [[Eleanor Bishop (Earth-616)|Eleanor Bishop]]'s death was faked, and Mother would not have taken her form regardless.{{r|Hawkeye Vol 5 #16}}
