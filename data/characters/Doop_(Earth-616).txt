===Early Years===
Information about Doop's origins, as with anything else about him, is difficult to verify.

According to [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], the [[U.S.A.|U.S.]] government created him in a secret [[Cold War (Event)|Cold War]] weapons project.{{citation}} Seemingly unable to learn English,{{r|All-New Doop #3}} He spoke an alien language (which somehow almost everyone understood or managed to learn anyway)<!-- Example of issues where characters learn his languages required -->. Allegedly, he had a role in the fall of communism in the Eastern Bloc. Doop also at some point met [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3}}

He has a mother, [[Mama Doop (Earth-616)|Mama Doop]], with whom he seems to have a difficult relationship.{{r|All-New Doop #3}}

At some other point, during an affair with a woman, Doop ditched her to be with the private detective her husband hired to find him.{{r|''[[I (heart) Marvel: My Mutant Heart Vol 1 1|I &#x2665; Marvel: My Mutant Heart]]''}} The private detective's name was Chandler, a nod to Raymond Chandler, the hard-boiled fiction writer who created Philip Marlowe.<ref>''(The Big Sleep, Farewell, My Lovely, The Long Goodbye)''</ref>

===[[X-Statix (Earth-616)|X-Statix/X-Force]]===
Doop joined the mutant team [[X-Statix (Earth-616)|X-Force]] as their official videographer.{{r|X-Force #116}} Soon afterward, most of X-Force died, and the survivors (including Doop) became X-Statix. There was some suspicion that he had a hidden agenda; if so, nothing ever came of it. He became a popular member, whose line of official merchandise sold well.

In X-Statix's penultimate adventure, Doop's brain exploded. His teammates and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] competed to find the scattered parts and reassemble them. Able to function with his secondary brain, Doop fought [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] for the last part and restored his primary brain.{{r|X-Statix #21}}{{r|X-Statix #25}} However, Doop would later die in a hail of bullets, as did the rest of X-Statix on their final mission.{{r|X-Statix #26}}

===Return===
Later, when a group of [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] were on a mission in space, [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] witnessed a strange thing in space,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 170}} which was later revealed to be Doop.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 180}} After [[M-Day]], the now depowered [[Gazer (Earth-616)|Gazer]] also apparently saw Doop through his telescope.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 180}}

Doop then fell from space to Earth, crashing in [[Costa Rica]] in close proximity to [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] and [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], revealing himself as Doop, alive but deformed.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 180}} Doop had a strange behaviour, acting like a child, continuously attacking Havok who was uncomfortable with him, and apparently talking to only Polaris (who called him '''Daap''').{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #181}}

Eventually Havok tried to destroy Doop, causing Doop to encapsulate both a nearby [[Leper Queen (Earth-616)|Leper Queen]] and Polaris within himself and shoot off into space.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 181}} The two women were instantly captured by [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] into his ship, while Doop was ejected back into space.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #185}}

===[[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]]'s time===
After the [[Schism (Event)|Schism]] between [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]'s Utopian X-Men and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine's]] side, Doop joined the latter, becoming the receptionist of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]]. His role was clearly contested by the School staff, as he appeared to be a thief, lazy, and useless.

However, he really was busy at school, asked by Logan to take care of the threats he could not handle with his own responsibility. He was seen battling various enemies, receiving even the help of [[Howard the Duck (Earth-616)|Howard the Duck]]. 

Doop apparently comes from a place called Marginalia, the world between worlds and a place that begins where the story ends.{{r|All-New Doop #2}}

When the mutant-only nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] formed, Doop apparently joined, as well as rejoined the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|X of Swords: Destruction Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  =  Doop's powers seemed to appear as needed. They could have been magical, psionic, or cosmic in nature. It has been said that Doop is an extra dimensional being:{{r|All-New Doop #1|5}}
* '''Genius Intellect and Psionic Powers''': Doop apparently is a genius with great intelligence and additionally possesses incredible mental powers, even when his brain is broken into pieces. For example, he can levitate dozens of people who are far away, throw incredible rays of energy, use his mental powers to avoid teleportation, and control Russians, since they apparently adore him.{{r|X-Statix #21}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3}}
* '''Possible Omniscience''': Apparently Doop's mind is full of information for some reason, this ability allows him to know a lot of things. As a leader, he saw Raze for the first time and already knew things all about him.{{r|All-New Doop #3}}
* '''Levitation and Fly:''' Doop could manipulate gravitons to float in place or fly quickly. Doop can move fast enough for even Thor to react to his attacks.{{r|X-Statix #25}}
* '''Cohesion:''' Doop could change his size and shape at will. He could also shift his form to "heal" wounds. When dispersed, parts of his body could reassemble themselves. For some reason, parts of his brain could not reassemble, possibly because of a redundant brain in his lower torso.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3}} After a strong energy blast from [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], if he is in fact Daap, he was able to restructure himself and to leave in a gel aspect, carrying two humans.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 181}}
* '''Superhuman Strength''': Doop possesses 100+ class strength whose limit is unknown. He is strong enough to fight Thor; even when Doop was weakened he was powerful enough to match or even overcome Thor in strength.{{r|X-Statix #21}}{{r|X-Statix #25}}
* '''Superhuman Durability''': Doop has an incredible superhuman resistance and his body is powerful enough to have survived such things as the [[Mjolnir]] being stuck in his brain, falling from outer space to the earth, receiving Thor's blows, and other attacks. Doop can survive in the vacuum of space without breathing.{{r|All-New Doop #1}}{{r|X-Statix #21}}{{r|X-Statix #22}}{{r|X-Statix #23}}
* '''Accelerated Regenerative Factor''': Doop can heal from incredibly serious wounds in a few seconds; he also doesn't seem to bleed. Doop can probably regenerate any part of his lost body, even after being disintegrated or killed.{{r|All-New Doop #1}}
* '''Resurrection:''' Doop apparently has the ability to resurrect, even after receiving damage to his primary brain and being shot dead. When he returned to earth he seemed to have revived.{{r|X-Statix #26}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #180}}
* '''Dimension Gate:''' Doop could assimilate objects, usually by mouth (but also by holes forming and closing from his body), and send them into another dimension called [[Doop Land]] for storage. Doop Land has significant differences from many other dimensions. This dimension seems to vary in space, time, and also depending on the people contained. Doop was able to absorb Mjolnir and drop a large number of exactly the same hammers, which even responded to Thor's call, although they proved not to possess the resistance of the original. Apparently Doop can eject hundreds of Doops from inside his body, in addition to having strange monsters inside the Doop Space. The objects that Doop creates / duplicates, such as Mjolnir, retain all their properties. Doop's powers seem to be powerful enough to build a house.{{r|X-Statix #18}}{{r|X-Force #123}}{{r|X-Force #21}}{{r|X-Force #23}}{{r|Wolverine/Doop #1|2}}{{r|X-Statix #25}}
* '''Reflexes and Speed:''' Doop has demonstrated incredible reflexes and speed, performing a large number of actions. At one point he was able to doop-space and take out his entire team in less than a second, without noticing that they had been there.{{r|X-Force #123}}
* '''Size Alteration:''' Doop can control his size and shape at will, becoming smaller or larger. He has shown that he can inflate his body to become giant and cushion the fall of Wolverine. Doop can inflate his body to unknown limits.{{r|Wolverine/Doop #2}}{{r|X-Force #123}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3}}
* '''Energy Projection:''' When Doop was contained, he opened his mouth and released a strange light that released him. Captain America affirmed that Doop has only demonstrated a small part of his potential and that he could destroy the world. The limit of Doop's energetic powers is unknown.{{r|Wolverine/Doop #2}}{{r|X-Statix #22}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3}}
* '''Travel across the margins:''' He is aware of the margins of the comic and the real world. He has even shown that he has the ability to travel between the margins of the pages from one side to the other, and time travel. It has been said that his ability can dig the real world and allows Doop to travel between time and space to Doop Space. This world has also been called Marginalia, the world between worlds, the world that begins where the story ends. Doop can use this power to travel through space and time, allowing Doop to go anywhere at any time.{{r|All-New Doop #1|5}}
*'''Fourth Wall:''' As a result of his existence, Doop seems to possess the ability to break the fourth wall, traveling between comics and vignettes.{{r|All-New Doop #2|5}}
*'''Love Eyes:''' Doop can use this ability to apparently fall in love; he has said that it is his way of showing affection.{{r|All-New Doop #2}}
*'''Psionic Fire:''' Doop has the ability to generate explosions of psychic fire.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3}}
*'''Psionic Blast:''' Doop could create psionic blasts and lasers of energy of unknown strength. He was able to project Havok on a tree and knock him down.{{r|X-Statix #21}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3}}
*'''Psionic Shield:''' Doop could protect himself and others nearby from telepathic and psionic probes.{{r|X-Statix #5}}
*'''Temporal Immunity:''' Doop could not be displaced in time.{{Citation}}
*'''Psionic Immunity:''' Doop is immune to psionic attacks and the like. Doop can also constantly generate short-range energy pulses that disable the psychic powers around him.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3}}
*'''Doopish Magic:''' Using a spark of [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]]'s magic, he was able to perform his own magic.{{r|All-New Doop #3}}
*'''The Power of the Funk:''' Doop mastered this power and used it on different occasions, defeating both [[Master Pandemonium]] and [[Fritz von Meyer (Earth-616)|Swarm]],{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #42}} and the Devil himself.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #17}}

| Abilities               = * '''Professional-level videographer'''{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3}}
* '''Investigator'''{{Citation}}
* '''Bilingual:''' He can speak a strange alien language, but has also learned English to speak with Kitty Pryde.{{r|All-New Doop #1|5}}
*'''Mystical Knowledge:''' Doop has knowledge of magic and mysticism. He also seems to know how to use a kind of Doop witchcraft like the one used to go with Mama Doop.{{r|All-New Doop #3}}
| Strength                = [[Strength Scale#Superhuman: Potentially incalculable. 2C able to lift in excess of 100 tons|Class 100+]]. Doop was able to survive a battle with Thor and overcome it, even when he was weakened because he had lost parts of his brain. It was claimed that he could even destroy the Earth.{{r|X-Statix #25}}
| Weaknesses              = Doop reportedly requires consistent and specialized medical care to live, which understandably is also horrendously expensive.{{r|X-Statix #16}}

| Equipment               = * Video cameras, microphones, relays, electric bass guitar, and amps.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #42}}
* A handheld device which apparently alerts him of "Global trouble searches" that "have results for you to view". This device alerts him of threats to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #17}}
* A [[Wolverine]] costume{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #17}}
| Transportation          = [[X-Men Blackbird]],{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #15}} motorcycle{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 2 #5}}
| Weapons                 = * An electric bass guitar and amps (using the '''Power of the Funk'''),{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #42}} an [[Ultimate Nullifier (Weapon)|Ultimate Nullifier]] (or a replica),{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #17}} a submachine-gun (which can use a load of living bees as ammunition), Doop can bring virtually any item due to its dimensional abilities,{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #17}} a chainsaw,{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #17}} briefly used bowling balls,{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #17}} formerly a baseball bat{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #17}}{{r|All-New Doop #5}}{{r|X-Force #123}}{{r|X-Force #21}}{{r|X-Force #23}}

| Notes                   = * The inspiration for this character seems to have come from [[w:c:ghostbusters:Slimer|Slimer]].{{citation}}
* The following image began circulating in September 2001 as a guide to [[Doop's language]]. [[file:Doop translator.jpg]]
* Doop apparently comes from a place called [[Marginalia]], the world between worlds, a place that begins where the story ends.{{r|All-New Doop #2}}
* During his return, Doop, if he is the so-called [[Daap (Earth-616)|Daap]], seems to have regressed, unstable both mentally and physical.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #180|181}} It may have been caused by the shock of his friends death,{{r|X-Statix #26}} his time in space,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #170}} and/or his crash.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #180|181}} His words had no meaning during this time,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #180|181}} but [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Lorna]] was apparently able to understand him,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #180|181}} making some believe he had some empathic or telepathic powers;{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #181}} however, Lorna was known for having been fragile mentally during this time,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #181}} and the loss of her powers may have pushed her further into only thinking she could understand him.{{Citation}}
==Relationship and sexuality==
* Doop is one of Marvel's few openly bisexual or pansexual characters.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #17}} It was later explained that ''"he ignored the questions, whether he was male, female, straight, gay"''.{{r|All-New Doop #4}}
* Doop is one of the more sexually active known characters: So far, it has been more or less hinted that Doop has had intercourse with [[Madonna (Earth-616)|Madonna]],{{r|Brotherhood #9}} two members (a woman and a man) of the [[Westchester County]] School Board,{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #17}} [[Ava'Dara Naganandini (Earth-616)|Warbird]],{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #17}} and also unknown male and female celebrities at the same time.{{r|All-New Doop #4}}
* It was also strongly hinted he practiced some sadomasochist sexual intercourse with [[Ava'Dara Naganandini (Earth-616)|Warbird]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #17}}
* He even teaches Advanced Mutant Sexuality at Xaviers at one point. He is shown teaching the lesson "Living and Loving in Your Mutant Skin".  {{r|Generation X Vol 2 #6}}
* He also expressed feelings for [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]], asking her to marry him, offering her a ring, taking her on a date, learning to speak English, and trying to hypnotize/seduce her.{{r|All-New Doop #1|2}}
| Trivia                  =
