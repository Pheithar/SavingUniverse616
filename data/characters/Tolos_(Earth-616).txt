| History                 = Tolos was telling [[Kirren (Earth-616)|Kirren]] that their [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|king]] and his wives were sleeping in different chambers. Kirren seemed unimpressed by this information and didn't want anything to do with the gossip because he didn't want a bad shift in guard duty like what Tolos always had.

Both Tolos and Kirrien were seemingly killed by an [[Outriders (Race)|Outrider]] which had just snuck on Black Bolt's chamber.{{r|Infinity #1}}
