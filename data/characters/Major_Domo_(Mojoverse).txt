===Early Life===
Major Domo is [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]]'s right-hand man. Possessed of a sarcastic wit, Major Domo is one of the only people who can get away with criticizing Mojo, as Mojo is usually too distracted to notice.{{r|Longshot #4}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual #15}}

===[[Mojo Worldwide]]===
When [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] created a massive electromagnetic pulse on [[Mojoworld]], it severed Mojo's ties to the [[Mojoverse]] and stranded he and his followers in [[Earth-616|the Prime Marvel Universe]]. There they established a new base in the sewers beneath the [[Empire State Building]] with plans to begin broadcasting the [[Mojo News Network (Earth-616)|Mojo News Network]].{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 15}}
