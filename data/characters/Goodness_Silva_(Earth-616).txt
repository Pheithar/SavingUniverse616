[[File:Goodness Silva (Earth-616) from Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|Good's human form]]
One night, their neighborhood was attacked by several supervillains, secretly hired by councilman [[Dick Snerd (Earth-616)|Dick Snerd]] to get rid of high-risk areas. A portion of the Silvas' house was damaged by [[Erikson Hades (Earth-616)|Firebrand]], severely injuring Lucky. Before coming to her brother's aid, Good used her powers to save a neighbour who was being terrorized by the villain [[Pitchfork (Earth-616)|Pitchfork]].{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 1}}

While remaining by Lucky's side at the hospital, Good caught a glimpse of a press conference on TV during which councilman Snerd praised the perpetrators of the attack for having targeted what he claimed were crime hotspots. Angered by the councilman's claims, Good located Snard and allegedly threw a glass bottle at him in protest. As she was being escorted into a police station, Good unwittingly transformed into her lupine form due to nervousness. Some heroes present at the scene, the [[Great Lakes Avengers (Earth-616)|Great Lakes Avengers]], intervened and calmed her down. The GLA's attorney [[Connie Ferrari (Earth-616)|Connie Ferrari]] looked into Good and temporarily made her part of the Avengers to ensure she wouldn't be prosecuted.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 2}}

When Goodness and [[Ashley Crawford (Earth-616)|Big Bertha]] decided to investigate Nain Rouge's bar, they found out the villain was in fact councilman Dick Snerd.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 3}} They took him hostage, and in a fit of rage, Goodness fatally injured him. When the team found out, they dropped Snerd at a hospital and escaped.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 4}}

Goodness was eventually reunited with Lucky after he escaped from his hospital room, and both decided to leave town.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 5}} However, Goodness ditched Lucky and returned to Detroit after learning of the GLA's fight against [[Doctor Nod (Earth-616)|Doctor Nod]],{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 6}} helping out the team defeat the villain's [[Bod Squad (Earth-616)|Bod Squad]].{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 7}}
