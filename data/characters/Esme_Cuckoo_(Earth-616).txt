===Origin===
While [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] lay in a comatose state, [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Dr. John Sublime]] harvested eggs from her to begin experimentation. The [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus program]] then used the eggs to create thousands of identical [[Homo superior|mutant]] girls in the hope of developing a powerful weapon capable of killing every mutant on [[Earth]] by combining their [[Telepathy|telepathic abilities]]. The project was designated '''[[Weapon XIV]]''', and the girls were incubated and artificially aged inside the subterranean level of [[The World]].{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 4}} While most girls remained dormant, five were sent to infiltrate the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] as student sisters to hone their talents for Sublime's purpose.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #3}}{{r|New X-Men #118}}

[[File:Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 1 134 001.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Esme and her sisters strutting in the halls of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Institute]]]]
===Xavier Institute===
After the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] went public,{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 117}} Esme and her sisters were enrolled as orphan quintuplet sisters.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 118}} To protect their secret origins, the girls unconsciously placed mental blocks in the minds of the faculty to prevent them from investigating their background.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 2}}

The girls quickly gained the moniker "'''The [[Stepford Cuckoos]]'''", though their chosen codename was the '''[[Five-In-One]]'''. [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] took a special interest in the girls, and the Cuckoos became her protégés.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 126}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 134}}

Esme began to distinguish herself from her sisters when she developed a crush on a student who turned out to be [[Stuff (Earth-616)|Stuff]], an advanced guard of the [[Shi'ar]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 123}} Due to embarrassment over her crush and jealousy of [[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]]'s power and influence, Esme began secretly using [[Hypercortisone D|Kick]] and working with [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]]. Esme began subtly influencing her sisters to gain control of their hive mind. When [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]] led a Kick fueled [[Omega Gang (Earth-616)|student]] rebellion at the X-Mansion, Sophie and the other Cuckoos covertly snuck into [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]]. Using Kick to amp up her powers, Esme and her sisters were able to stop Quire. Unfortunately, Sophie died in the process.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 134|137}} Unbeknownst to the others, Sophie was actually being influenced into these actions by Esme, who was also using Kick.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 141}}

Shortly after the death of Sophie, Esme attempted to murder Emma by shooting her with a diamond bullet. While [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] and [[Sage (Earth-616)|Sage]] investigated the murder, Esme fled the X-Mansion fearing that the truth of her involvement in the deaths of Sophie and Emma would be revealed.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 139|141}}

===Brotherhood of Mutants===
When Esme returned, it was alongside her lover [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]] posing as [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and his [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Mutants]]. Esme and Xorn had both become mentally unstable through excessive use of Kick. When Xorn's affections were withheld from her, Esme turned on him, and Xorn killed her by burying her metal earrings in her brain.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 146|150}}

===Resurrection===
When an unstable fraction of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] sparked inside the girls, the dormant [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus]] nanotech inside their bones was activated. This nanotech briefly reanimated Sophie and Esme, who directed their sisters back to [[The World]] to activate [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Sublime]]'s plan for the destruction of the [[Homo superior|mutant race]]. Sophie and Esme were later killed by [[Celeste Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Celeste]] wielding the Phoenix.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong Vol 1 1|5}}

When the [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (Earth-616)|Chaos King]] put the living asleep and opened the underworld, Esme, [[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]], [[John Proudstar (Earth-616)|Thunderbird]], [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggert]], and several of [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]]'s duplicates were among the resurrected. Sophie confronted Esme about her death with little resolution. While searching for answers among the remains of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]], the former X-Men were attacked by the [[Carrion Crow (Earth-616)|Carrion Crow]]. Sophie sacrificed herself to save the others,{{r|Chaos War: X-Men Vol 1 1}} and Esme later sacrificed herself to save her sister.{{r|Chaos War: X-Men Vol 1 2}}

===Clash with [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]]===
Esme and Sophie returned from death to celebrate their birthday; however she selfishly wanted to regain her full strength and manipulated her sisters into helping her. To make sure no one got in the way, she killed Sophie so she could manipulate Mindee, Pheobe, and Celeste again.<ref>[[X-23 Vol 4 1|''X-23'' Vol 4 #1]]-[[X-23 Vol 4 5|5]]</ref>

=== Dawn of X ===
Following the foundation of a mutant state in [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] by the hand of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] and his allies, Esme resurfaced as a citizen of the nation, having been presumably reborn by the hand of [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]], a group of mutants capable of combining their powers into a process of resurrection, brought together by Xavier as part of his plans for mutant ascension.<!-- {{r|House of X Vol 1 1}} -->

The Stepford Cuckoos accompanied Magneto for a meeting with a delegation of international ambassadors and representatives at the [[Jerusalem Habitat]], in order to assert the new status quo of mutantkind, and set the terms of the new mutant state and its relationship to humanity.{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}}

When a mutant baby went missing in Philadelphia, [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Kid Cable]] headed to the scene of crime with Esme Cuckoo, who was jealous that her fiancé previously took her sister Celeste on a better and romantic date. After they made out, Kid Cable, who was actually dating all the five Cuckoo sisters at the time, asked Esme what the other Cuckoos were doing when he was on a date with one of them and if they ever got jealous. The girl claimed her sisters were doing other stuff, when they actually were psychically spying on them from their room on Krakoa.

However, Nathan and Esme date night was abruptly interrupted when the [[Spaceknights (Galadorian) (Earth-616)|Space-Knights]] from [[Galador]] came to Earth, detecting the energy signature from their mythical sword - the [[Light of Galador]] - after it was recovered by Nathan in Krakoa's wilds. They crashed into the house where Cable and Esme were hanging out and took the sword away from them.{{r|Cable Vol 4 2}} Kidnapped by the Space-Knights along with Esme, Kid Cable discovered his older self (who foresaw and accepted his own death) had actually left him an ace hidden inside his techno-organic steel sleeve to use against the knights: a nuclear bomb. After retrieving his new sword, Kid Cable lured the knights to a remot desert where he sets off the bomb, completely obliterating the Space-Knights. Nathan and Esme escaped back to Krakoa through an emergency portal without collateral damage, promising to see each other again after Cable's date night with her sister Phoebe the next day.{{r|Cable Vol 4 3|4}}
