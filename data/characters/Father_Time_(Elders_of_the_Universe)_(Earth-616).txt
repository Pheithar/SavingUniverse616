* Father Time the Elder of the Universe should not be confused with [[Larry Scott (Earth-616)|Larry Scott]], the Golden Age hero Father Time first appearing in [[Captain America Comics Vol 1 6|''Captain America Comics'' #6]] (September [[1941]]). Other characters appearing in early pre-Marvel Comics may or may not be Father Time.
* [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] and [[Aquaria Neptunia (Earth-616)|Namora]] met a Father Time in [[Blonde Phantom Comics Vol 1 15|''Blonde Phantom Comics'' #15]] (Fall [[1947]]) and the [[Louise Grant (Earth-616)|Blonde Phantom]] herself met him too in [[Blonde Phantom Comics Vol 1 22|''Blonde Phantom Comics'' #22]] (March [[1949]]) and [[Marvel Mystery Comics Vol 1 91|''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #91]] (April 1949). Plus [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Golden Age 2004 Vol 1 1|''The Official Handbook Of The Marvel Universe: Golden Age 2004'']] says that the Blonde Phantom occasionally received assignments from a mysterious man called Father Time.
* The short prose story ''Zero of time'', originally published in [[Adventures into Weird Worlds Vol 1 7|''Adventures Into Weird Worlds'' #7]] (June [[1952]]) and reprinted in [[Strange Tales Vol 1 115|''Strange Tales'' #115]] ([[1963]], uncredited author) [[http://www.comics.org/issue/75624]] also features a character calling himself Father Time, who may be this one. That story may not have happen in Earth-616 continuity.
* There is a Pecos Bill in the [[Jim Gardley (Earth-616)|Masked Raider]] story in [[Marvel Mystery Comics Vol 1 9|''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #9]] (July 1941); and Uncle Sam appears in [[All Winners Comics Vol 1 6|''All-Winners Comics'' #6]] (Fall [[1942]])
