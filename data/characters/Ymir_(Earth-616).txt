===Origin===
Ymir came to being on [[Niffleheim]], one of the [[Glossary:Ten Realms|Ten Realms]]. He was the progenitor and the most powerful of the [[Ice Giants]] (''Hrimthurs''), a race from which the [[Giants of Jotunheim]] (among them [[Storm Giants]], [[Mountain Giants]], [[Rime Giants]], and most notably the [[Frost Giants]]) descended. Like the other Ice Giants, Ymir was covered with snow and ice, and constantly generated intense coldness from his body.{{r|Thor: The Legend #1}} The huge size, durability, and colossal strength of the Ice Giants made them formidable foes to the gods of [[Asgard (Realm)|Asgard]] over the millennia. Except for the [[Fire Giants|Fire Giant]] [[Surtur (Earth-616)|Surtur]], Ymir was the oldest known being in the Ten Realms.<!-- {{r|Thor: The Legend #1}} -->

It has been said that millennia ago, warm air from the realm of fire [[Muspelheim]] crossed a dimensional barrier into the location of the magical [[Well of Life]]. Enormous amounts of ice from [[Niffleheim]], the realm of ice and cold, formed above the Well of Life. In time, the warm air from Muspelheim caused the ice over the Well to transform into the living, sentient Ymir. Another being appeared from the ice, the enchanted cow [[Audumbla (Earth-616)|Audumbla]]. Audumbla fed off the ice itself, and Ymir subsisted on the milk Audumla produced.{{r|Thor: The Legend #1}}

[[File:TalesOfAsgard 98.jpg|left|thumb]]
===Early years===
During a battle between the Ice Giants and the Asgardians, the young god [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] and his brothers [[Vili Borson (Earth-616)|Vili]] and [[Ve Borson (Earth-616)|Ve]] slew Ymir.{{r|Thor Annual #5}}{{r|Thor #294}} In return, the Ice Giants and the [[Giants of Jotunheim]] declared war on the Asgardians for slaying their progenitor.{{r|Journey into Mystery #97}} Meanwhile, Ymir's blood was used to produce a wine of which [[Lerad (Earth-616)|Lerad]] managed to acquire many barrels.{{r|Thor: Blood Oath #2}} After Ymir succeeded in regenerating himself, Odin created a chasm containing an interdimensional nexus through which Ymir's army plunged into Muspelheim, where the native demons took the Giants prisoners. Odin then entrapped Ymir himself within a circle of flame within a volcanic area.{{r|Journey into Mystery #98}}

===[[Hyborian Age]]===
At some point before 10,000 BC, humans began to worship Ymir and his first daughter as deities. Among these humans were the [[Midgard Vanir|Vanir]] of [[Vanaheim (Hyboria)|Hyborean Vanaheim]] people whose members would include [[Ulysses Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Ulysses Bloodstone]].{{r|Savage Tales #1}}{{Verify source}}

[[Conan (Earth-616)|Conan the Barbarian]] once met [[Atali (Frost Giant) (Earth-616)|Atali]], who claimed to be a daughter of Ymir, and set a trap for Conan. Conan was able to kill [[Atali's Brothers (Earth-616)|Atali's Frost Giant brothers]], before he was struck.{{r|Savage Tales #1}}

===[[Modern Age]]===
Centuries later in modern day, the [[Midgard Vanir]] captured [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] of the first class of [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] in order to use his powers and him as a sacrifice to bring back Ymir, for them to rule a frozen Earth. Helped by [[Donald Blake (Earth-616)|Donald Blake]], the X-Men were able to save Iceman, but Vanir's minion [[Ulf (Earth-616)|Ulf]] the [[Ice Troll]] served as sacrifice in his place, awakening Ymir. This one rejected the Vanir, while Blake turned into [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]. While the Odinson was able to stop him and exile him to the nether realm of Asgard, Ymir could now easily breach the gaps between worlds, becoming a more pressing matter for Earth's safety.{{r|X-Men First Class #5}} He was later fully returned by [[Bellos (Earth-616)|Bellos of the Bold Eye]] who murdered the [[Frost Giants]] children in  his village and used their blood to fully complete the ritual before he himself was killed by [[Utand (Earth-616)|Utand]] and the rest of the villagers.{{r|Thor #419}}

A member of the mystical cult called the [[Sons of Satannish (Earth-616)|Sons of Satannish]] used the so-called Spell of Fire and Ice to bring both Ymir and Surtur to Earth, where they began wreaking havoc.{{r|Doctor Strange #177|178}} While Ymir attacked [[Wakanda]], Surtur wreaked havoc in [[Antarctica]]. Earth's Sorcerer Supreme, [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Stephen Strange]], used the Crystal of Conquest, which contained part of the mystical power of the demons known as [[Satannish (Earth-616)|Satannish]] and [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]], to transport Surtur and Ymir magically into each other's presence at the very instant they were lashing out with their weapons. Ymir and Surtur thus struck each other's weapons, creating a mystical "implosion" in which each being temporarily cancelled out the powers of the other, and each was returned to his home dimension, Surtur to Muspelheim and Ymir to Niffleheim.{{r|Avengers #61}}

[[File:Surtur (Earth-616) and Ymir (Earth-616) from Thor Vol 1 425 001.jpg|thumb|200px|Surtur vs. Ymir]]
Ymir escaped again and started working with the Frost Giants, led by [[Bjorn the White (Earth-616)|Bjorn the White]], and [[Storm Giants]], led by [[Grim Graybeard (Earth-616)|Grim Graybeard]]. He launched an attack on Asgard. However he was stopped by Thor and his brother [[Vidar Odinson (Earth-616)|Vidar]].{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes Vol 2 5}} After Ymir reached freedom once again,{{r|Thor Vol 1 421}} Surtur disguised himself as Odin as part of a plan to destroy Asgard and told [[Heimdall (Earth-616)|Heimdall]] that [[Ragnarok (Event)|Ragnar√∂k]] was upon them and Ymir had to be be stopped.{{r|Thor #422}} After warriors were sent to fight Ymir,{{r|Thor #423}} Odin transformed into Surtur and fought Ymir.{{r|Thor #424}} With Surtur and Ymir locked in combat, Thor retrieved the [[Twilight Sword (Surtur)|Twilight Sword]] from the [[Sea of Eternal Night]]. After Thor lit the Twilight Sword in the Eternal Flame, Odin's control over Surtur started to vanish. Surtur and Ymir fought over the Twilight Sword, and while they were distracted, Thor transported them both into the Sea of Eternal Night, where they would be frozen for all time.{{r|Thor #425}} They remained there for many years.{{r|Thor #473}}

Many years later, under unrevealed circumstances, Ymir resurfaced on [[Manhattan]] in [[Earth|Midgard]], and used his powers to merge Midgard with Niffleheim. When the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] and the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] tried to confront him, Ymir banished them to the in-between of the merged planes. The heroes found Ymir's stronghold, and [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]] retrieved the Twilight Sword from it. Releasing the sword from its containment caused Ymir to retreat, undoing the merging for the worlds as well.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2009 Avengers}}

Ymir's subsequent attempt at taking over Midgard saw him use a duplicate shell of himself to command an army of Frost Giants. He was intercepted by Thor and Iceman and, during battle, Ymir tricked Thor into using his lightning to power his newly-constructed [[Casket of Future Winters]], unleashing the icy winds of oblivion itself. The power of the casket and the ice it released allowed Iceman to power up and summon golems of ice to single-handedly defeat Ymir's army. Iceman blasted the casket out of Ymir's hands, while Thor summoned a lightning to shatter Ymir's proxy.{{r|A + X Vol 1 7}}

During the [[War of the Realms]], the Frost Giants allied themselves with the [[Dark Elves|Dark Elf]] king [[Malekith (Earth-616)|Malekith the Accursed]] to take over Midgard. To help the campaign of conquest, the Frost Giant king [[Laufey (Earth-616)|Laufey]] confined Ymir in a stronghold in [[Miami]], [[Florida (State)|Florida]] from which enslaved locals were forced to mine and harvest pieces of Ymir's flesh to spawn Ice Giants from them. When a group of Earth's heroes, [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]], [[Raz Malhotra (Earth-616)|Giant-Man]], [[Thomas Foster (Earth-616)|Goliath]], and [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Atlas]], infiltrated Ymir's prison, they destroyed the shackles keeping him prisoner. Ymir fled from Midgard back to his home realm.{{r|Giant-Man Vol 1 3}}

| Powers                  = Ymir possesses vast superhuman strength, greater than that of any other Frost or Ice Giant. He is extremely long-lived, and possibly immortal. His body greatly resembles ice in various ways, and if it was not for his ability to generate intense cold from his body, Ymir would melt when exposed to high temperatures. Ymir's body is extraordinarily resistant to injury, and although it can be shattered, as ice can, Ymir can cause the fragments of his form to reassemble.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #12}}

Ymir continually generates extreme cold from his body in an unknown, perhaps magical fashion. If he so chooses, Ymir can cause anything he touches, including the air, to freeze.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 15}}
*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Ymir can lift things up to 100 tons. His strength is greater than that of any other Frost or Ice Giant.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 3 3}}
*'''Frost Immunity:''' As the King of Jotuns, Ymir is immune to coldness. His body is made of thick ice.
*'''Cryokinesis:''' Ymir can generate intense cold from his body. Ymir can cause anything he touches, including the air, to freeze.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #32}}
**'''''Cryokinesis Inhibition:''''' Ymir proved to be able to prevent other from using their elemental powers.{{r|X-Men First Class #5}}
*'''Immortality:''' Ymir is extremely long-lived, bordering on immortality.{{r|Heroic Age: Villains #1}}
**'''''Regeneration:''''' Ymir can cause the fragments of his form to reassemble.{{r|Heroic Age: Villains #1}}

| Abilities               = Although intelligent and capable of speech, Ymir is not particularly cunning, and attempts to win his battles through brute force. 
| Strength                = The extent of Ymir's strength has never been measured, but it is at least in the Class 100 range; hence, he can lift (press) over [[Strength Scale#100 Tons|100 tons]].{{r|Avengers Assemble #1}}
| Weaknesses              = Ymir is vulnerable to extreme high temperature. It would caused him to melt down.

| Equipment               = 
| Transportation          = Extra-dimensional teleportation, usually under his own power. 
| Weapons                 = Ymir carries an enormous, ice-covered club, which he uses as a weapon. Possibly the club is entirely composed of ice.

| Notes                   = * {{WP|Ymir}} was the progenitor of all [[Jotuns|giants]] in the Norse mythology.
** Based on this mythological figure, [[Robert E. Howard|Robert E. Howard]] created Ymir, the god of the [[Vanir (Nordheimr)|Vanir]] in the [[Conan]] short story "[[Wikipedia:The Frost-Giant's Daughter|The Frost-Giant's Daughter]] (published posthumously in 1953) by [[Robert E. Howard|Robert E. Howard]], adapted in {{cl|Savage Tales #1}} (May, 1971), written by [[Roy Thomas|Roy Thomas]] and [[Barry Windsor-Smith|Barry Smith]].

* Legends also state that he was once a [[Homo sapiens|human]] with elemental powers of winter.{{r|X-Men First Class #5}}<!-- possibly only the Ymir from Conan stories? -->
