===Six Pack===
G. W. Bridge was member of the mercenary group called the Wild Pack, later known as the [[Six Pack (Earth-616)|Six Pack]], which was led by [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]]. The Six Pack was decimated in an assault on one of Stryfe's hidden bases.{{r|Cable - Blood and Metal Vol 1 2}}

===S.H.I.E.L.D.===
[[File:George Washington Bridge (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 1 19 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]
Bridge became a major of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]{{r|X-Force Vol 1 1}} In the early stages of [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]], Bridge tracked Cable and tried to capture him. S.H.I.E.L.D. formed an alliance with [[Department K (Earth-616)|Department K]] to fund a joint task force called [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E. (Earth-616)|Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]] to bring Cable down.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 11}} Along with former Six Pack members [[Garrison Kane (Earth-616)|Kane]] and [[Theodore Winchester (Earth-616)|Grizzly]], plus other recruits, Bridge attacked X-Force in an attempt to arrest Cable. Weapon P.R.I.M.E. failed, and X-Force made off in Bridge's own air transport.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 12|14}}

After Cable was presumed dead, Bridge and [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] led a squad into space to lay claim to [[Graymalkin (Space Station)|Graymalkin]], but they were repelled by X-Force.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 20|23}} Quitting S.H.I.E.L.D. after this and the Weapon P.R.I.M.E. fiasco, Bridge went looking for Cable on his own. They met up as Cable returned from his future timeline to his Swiss chalet, and mostly buried the hatchet. G.W. joined up with the former Six Pack members as they parted ways with Cable.{{r|Cable Vol 1 3|5}}

During Cable's conflict with the [[Dark Sisterhood (Earth-616)|Dark Sisterhood]], Bridge was on a mission to capture Cable, who was suspected of killing S.H.I.E.L.D's agents.{{r|Cable Vol 1 90|91}}

===Civil War===
During the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], or shortly after, Bridge briefly became the leader of the Six Pack again and was hired by the US government to attack [[Rumekistan]], a country which Cable had temporarily seized power in, with the approval of the people, and was trying to make a utopia before scheduled free elections began. Cable's attention was diverted by a nuclear explosion on [[Providence (Island)|Providence]] so that Bridge and the Six Pack could make their way covertly into the country as insurgents. They placed devices which would cause chaos with the power grid to destabilize the country and work towards tarnishing Cable's reputation while S.H.I.E.L.D. lied to the media about radioactive fallout caused by the 'accident' on Providence. Bridge and the Six Pack were unaware that Cable knew of their plans and allowed them to happen so he could defeat and expose them, so as to cement his stature with the people. Bridge and the team were then captured and publicly shamed for their actions.{{r|Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 33|34}}

After the Civil War, Bridge tried to capture and stop the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] and failed while working with S.H.I.E.L.D. team.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 1|3}} He began working alone and at [[Times Square]], he tried to trick the Punisher by releasing and paying [[Carl Burbank (Earth-616)|Bushwacker]] to act as bait. The operation was a failure as everyone forgot the situation, watching coverage of the [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] assassination on the giant Time Square screen after Bushwacker was taken down and Bridge was deputised while dealing with the situation.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 5}} A second operation was conducted by Bridge and [[Jasper Sitwell (Earth-616)|Sitwell]], failing too.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 6}}

===Hunting Punisher===
After this, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]], director of S.H.I.E.L.D., dismissed him from his functions due to his failures and the actions he had taken, this didn't stop Bridge as he quickly returned to tracking the Punisher as a freelance operative covertly offering bounty hunters a million dollars for information leading him to the Punisher.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 8}}

Contacted by [[Stuart Clarke (Earth-616)|Stuart Clarke]], he helped them take down the racist white nationalist [[National Force (Hate-Monger) (Earth-616)|National Force]] group who were led by a new [[Hate-Monger (National Force) (Earth-616)|Hate-Monger]], and let Clarke and Castle free to leave when they surrendered. He was quickly contacted by Stark but took pleasure in refusing his proposition. When Stark came to see him to try and convince him to start working with S.H.I.E.L.D. again he admitted to letting the Punisher go, and to his internal struggles regarding his hate for the Punisher and ultimately agreed to come back into the fold, as long as he had his 'crew' working alongside him.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 9|11}}

G.W.Bridge began putting together an all female team to take on Frank, consisting of [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]], [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]] and [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Earth-616)|Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]]. Frank was plagued by the return of [[William Russo (Earth-616)|Jigsaw]] who, alongside [[Lynn Michaels (Earth-616)|Lynn Michaels]], had brainwashed a former auxiliary volunteer officer named [[Ian (Auxiliary Police) (Earth-616)|Ian]] to act as the Punisher to aid him in gun running and other criminal enterprises while framing Frank and sending [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] assassins to kill him. Bridge didn't believe Frank to be guilty of these crimes, and brought his team to New York to discover the truth but also to still try and take him down.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 18|21}}

Bridge ended up saving Frank from Ian just in time, before he was going to be killed and arrested him. Bridge was finally able to truly sit down and talk with Frank while transferring him to the [[Raft]], using the conversation largely to insult him and tell him that he believed Frank had kept Jigsaw alive to make himself feel better in comparison to him. Before they could reach the Raft though they were attacked by the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]] on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], who had been hired to finish the job that the Hand had failed at, with Bridge getting him badly in the knee by the [[Wrecker's Crowbar]]. Frank had a chance to kill Jigsaw and escape with the mystically empowered Crowbar but chose to let Bridge arrest him and send him to the Raft instead.{{r|{{cl|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 22}}-[[Punisher War Journal Vol 2 23|23]]}}

When the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion]] of Earth began, Bridge was working with S.H.I.E.L.D. to combat the invasion. Bridge was informed by [[Jasper Sitwell (Earth-616)|Jasper Sitwell]] that the Punisher had broken out of the Grey Facility in which he had been imprisoned and headed into the heart of New York City, where his attack on a group of Skrulls had threatened the lives of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Bridge was sent after the Punisher and found him shortly before Frank was attacked by a [[Super-Skrulls (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]] modeled after the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] and [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]]. The two were initially saved from this Skrull by [[Stuart Clarke (Earth-616)|Stuart Clarke]], who had donned the [[Rampage]] exo-suit to kill Frank in vengeance for the murder of [[Tatiana Arocha (Earth-616)|Tatiana Arocha]].{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 24}}

The fight with the Super-Skrull commenced again shortly after while Clarke was attempting to kill Frank, causing Bridge to have to fight and kill the Skrull alone. After killing this Skrull, Bridge was then targeted by another Skrull, who was using a far reaching sniper rifle to target him. Bridge was saved from the sniper by Frank who he then revealed the truth about Clarke to, that Clarke was a cop killer with an obsessive vendetta against [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]], which led Frank to leave Bridge alone to target Clarke who had gone to take out the sniper. The building in which Frank and Clarke fought was destroyed by a group of Skrulls, who Bridge took out, before finding an injured Clarke in the rubble and informing him that Frank had taken the opportunity to disappear. Bridge then visited Clarke in the hospital where he had received grafts to fix his face, which was now scarred in a similar way to [[William Russo (Earth-616)|Jigsaw]].{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 25}} 

===Dark Reign===
With the fall of the S.H.I.E.L.D, Bridge no longer had money to feed his new wife and her child. Abducted by some of the criminals resurrected in order to kill Castle, he was finally killed by the resurrected [[Linus Liberman (Earth-616)|Microchip]] as a sacrifice for the resurrection of Frank Castle and Microchip's families.{{r|Punisher Vol 8 10}}

===Return===
Bridge later returned to life through unknown means and became a member of the ruling board of the organization [[J.A.N.U.S. (Earth-616)|J.A.N.U.S.]] He attended a meeting with J.A.N.U.S.'s other leaders where they were briefed by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]], their mole within the [[Ravencroft Institute]].{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 5}}
