Jake Oh was born to Korean immigrants in the [[United States of America]].

Jake was being stationed at a Mojave S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, guarding a comatose [[James Woo (Earth-616)|Jimmy Woo]] before he was broken out by his former comrades, [[M-11 (Earth-616)|M-11]] and [[Kenneth Hale (Earth-616)|Gorilla Man]].{{r|Agents of Atlas Vol 1 1}} Later, Jake was reassigned to [[The World (Weapon Plus)|the World]]. At first he enjoyed, but, after the first couple of weeks, he grew bored with the quasi-temporal space and "whale-brained machines". Three months into the mission, he finally saw some action with the arrival of the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]], who had become [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] hosts. Though it fixed his boredom, this event resulted in the complete destruction of the place and everything in it.{{r|War Machine Vol 2 2|3}}

===War Machine===
Later, Jake became an ally of [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|Jim Rhodes]] and a member of Rhodey's medical "staff" which aided Rhodes on his never-ending mission as War Machine. While James fought a one-man war against the forces in Santo Marco, Jake Oh was working with a corrupt arms-dealing company known as [[Eaglestar International (Earth-616)|Eaglestar International]]. Jake and Jim's journey together began while Jim was searching for an old friend of his, [[Glenda Sandoval (Earth-616)|Glenda Sandoval-Jacobs]], with the help of her husband, [[Parnell Jacobs (Earth-616)|Parnell Jacobs]], a former thief of the War Machine armor. Rhodey fought to save her while Jake disobeyed his fellow soldiers who had kept her detained. Eventually, after War Machine assimilated with a tank in order to fight [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]], Jake was able to tend to Glenda and met up with Rhodey and Glenda's captor and Eaglestar CEO, [[Davis Harmon (Earth-616)|Davis Harmon]]. Davis led them all down a corridor to a vault containing his most powerful weapons. Glenda killed Davis in retaliation for her assault and Ares' ego leads him to open the vault, releasing many people infected with an Ultimo virus.{{r|War Machine Vol 2 2|3}}

War Machine, Ares, and Jake and his squad killed those infected (even Glenda). War Machine, angered about Ares killing Glenda, attacked him but they were interrupted by Jake fleeing from the reincarnated Ultimo-infected which now includes his squad. At risk of the infected reaching the capital city of Makazan, all three engage the infected but it ends with War Machine damaged and Ares infected and rampaging through the city.{{r|War Machine Vol 2 #4}} War Machine and Jake prepare to assault Ares and the other infected who have reached the city. As Rhodey absorbs the Ultimo virus in preparation for a cure, Jake gets Glenda and a U.S. senator to safety. In the aftermath, Rhodey, Jake, Parnell, Glenda, [[Bethany Cabe (Earth-616)|Bethany Cabe]] and [[Suzi Endo (Earth-616)|Suzi Endo]] come together and turn down an opportunity to work for Norman Osborn (which means Jake has to decline his "reward", a mint-in-box 1976 bicentennial edition Captain America action figure).  Instead, Jake decides to help War Machine bring the fight to America.{{r|War Machine Vol 2 5}}

The team's first stop is Rhodey's mother's house on Navajo land which is protected by [[Jason Strongbow (Earth-616)|American Eagle]]. While Rhodey is talking with his mother, Jake and the team confront American Eagle which ends with Jake getting a broken nose. After five minutes inside, War Machine (actually Jake) tries talking American Eagle down but after a quick bout Jake is revealed just as the real War Machine flies over heading on his way to attack Mackelroy Army Base to destroy more Ultimo tech. As Jake and company follow Rhodey to the next target, Jake, still in armor, starts contemplating his own alias â€” his best attempt is War Machina.{{citation}}

===Hulk===
Jake ditched the War Machine alias at some point, working for S.H.I.E.L.D. as a regular agent. In the middle of the [[Civil War II|second superhuman civil war]], he worked with the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] as S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison during his mission to track down the new Hulk, [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus Cho]].{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 10}} Black Panther and Jake later assisted Hulk and his sister [[Madame Curie Cho (Earth-616)|Maddy]] in fighting the [[Christian Sung (Earth-616)|Austin Monster]], with Jake using a protocol originally meant for the Hulk, which sent the Austin Monster to the [[Negative Zone]].{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 11}}
