| History                 = Miss Locke was a devout follower of Arcade and recruited the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] to save him when he was kidnapped by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]. Once, as a birthday present, she tried to kill him using robots to the likeness of Doctor Doom, giving him a great thrill.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #145|147}}

Miss Locke was famous because she "never smiled". However, a glimpse of a smile could be seen when she was drugging the X-Men when accepting defeat during the birthday surprise, and again when hearing one of [[Murderworld]]'s intended victims [[Courtney Ross (Earth-616)|Courtney Ross]] telling a joke to survive.{{r|Excalibur #4|5}}

Miss Locke and Arcade frequently played games where they attempted to kill each other. Although intended as a sadistic form of fun, they eventually went too far and Arcade murdered Locke in a fit of rage. To hide his crime and use it for his amusement, Arcade staged a complex "Jack the Ripper"-like series of murders, hiding Miss Locke's body among the victims. He also arranged to blame [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] for the murders, and recruited [[Martinique Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Mastermind]] to help "punish" the mutant killer. The truth was eventually found out and Mastermind left Arcade in a telepathically-induced delusion.{{r|Wolverine / Gambit: Victims #1|4}}

Miss Locke has since been seen alive, but whether her death was faked or if Arcade was merely using his lifelike robots to imitate his lost partner is unknown.{{r|Colossus #1}}

Arcade would later confirm he did murder Miss Locke in cold blood despite her years of faithful service once she, in Arcade’s mind, had tried to get “too close” to him by having an emotional and physical relationship.{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 7}}
