[[File:Wild Sentinels from New X-Men Vol 1 115 004.jpg|160px|thumb|left|Wild Sentinels attacking]]
The Wild Sentinels were the result of a U.S. funded program in [[Ecuador]] to develop evolving, self sustaining [[Sentinels]]. The Wild Sentinel [[Master Mold (Earth-616)|Master Mold]], designed by [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar Trask]], was designed to scavenge all technology and material within its test radius and build troops out of it.{{r|New X-Men #114}}

[[Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-616)|Cassandra Nova]] used [[Donald Trask III (Earth-616)|Donald Trask III]] to order the Master Mold to abandon its 'test radius', and send four giant Wild Sentinels to attack [[Genosha]], before copying his DNA and killing him. This attack caused the death of almost all inhabitants of the island, about sixteen millions mutants.{{r|New X-Men #115}}

Two of the Wild Sentinels reached Genosha and wiped out almost all of the inhabitants and then became dormant they were left alone for fear of reactivating them.{{r|New X-Men #116}} The one-headed attacker was not seen again, whilst [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]] and others transformed the three-headed Genosha attacker into a memorial to [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] heedless of warnings.{{r|New X-Men #132}}[[File:Wild Sentinels from New X-Men Vol 1 115 002.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Wild Sentinel]]

===The [[Amazon Belle]] in [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]]===
At some point, a cargo ship, the [[Amazon Belle]], loaded with Wild Sentinels who parasitized it, using every useless piece of metal to create more of their kind, headed up to [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]]. They travelled through [[Canada|Canadian]] waters and caused the death of several Canadian coast guards.{{r|Mekanix #1}}

Eventually reaching Chicago, they started to investigate, killing every person they encountered, stating they were "potential mutants". Thr victims included [[Maria Bonnaventura (Earth-616)|Maria Bonnaventura]] and [[Joey Cascio (Earth-616)|Joey Cascio]], gangsters, and even dogs, before attacking [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]], [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Shan Coy Manh]], and [[Shola Inkose (Earth-616)|Shola Inkose]]. The former X-Men stated that those Wild Sentinels had somehow evolved, being in a sense themselves mutants.{{r|Mekanix #4|5}}

Finally, the Wild Sentinels attacked the [[University of Chicago]] during a public debate opposing the mutants and tolerance parts against [[Alice Tremaine (Earth-616)|Alice Tremaine]]'s [[Purity (Earth-616)|Purity]] hate-group.{{r|Mekanix #5|6}} Campus security and the [[Chicago Police Department]] came but were overwhelmed by the Sentinels. Combining their powers, Kitty, Shan, and Shola were able to destroy all of them, except for one, damaged, that was recuperated by Tremaine who brought it home to repair it, and Shola and Kitty were then able to avenge their respective parents, killed on [[Genosha]].{{r|Mekanix #6}}

===Giant Wild Sentinel revived===
When [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]] attempted to kill [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] at Genosha, 'she' revived the three headed model and gave it intelligence, but barred it from examining its original Genosha orders. When [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] convinced 'him' to do so, he was shocked by the magnitude of his crime and left to "spend some time alone".{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 11|12}}

He returned to Earth months later, as news of the [[Breakworld]] Bullet reached the heroes in New York, so it provided transport up to the [[Peak VII|Peak Station]]. Following the incapacitation of the heroes due to the magical protection the bullet had against interference, this Sentinel tried to save the world by ramming the Breakworld bullet off course, in an act of penance. His sacrifice was in vain however.{{r|Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men Vol 1 1}}

When [[George Tarleton (Earth-11131)|M.O.D.O.K.]] was being contained by [[Karl Mordo (Earth-11131)|Baron Mordo]], he took over all of the [[Sentinels]] of the [[Sentinel Territories]] to free himself, including the Wild Sentinels which attacked and vaporized the Baron's [[Mindless Ones]]. {{r|M.O.D.O.K. Assassin Vol 1 5}}

===[[Earth-42221]]===
[[File:Wild Sentinels from What If? Astonishing X-Men Vol 1 1 001.png|thumb|right]]
After [[Ultron (Earth-42221)|Ultron]] and [[Danger (Earth-42221)|Danger]] killed the X-Men, Danger and Ultron had as a gift from their children the Wild Sentinel, Charles Xavier.

He tried to explain his acts and to apologize, knowing he wouldn't get any forgiveness. Ultron then made the Wild Sentinel close, crushing Xavier in it.

The trio then left the planet and conquered the Shi'ar, were made the parental figures of the [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]] and set about to annihilate all life in the universe.{{r|What If? Astonishing X-Men Vol 1 1}}
