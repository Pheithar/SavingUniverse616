| Overview             = '''Karla Sofen''' was a renowned psychiatrist, who enjoyed manipulating her patients into paranoia rather than helping them.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 -1}} Her unethical behavior as a psychiatrist led her to be an assistant of the villainous [[Johann Fennhoff (Earth-616)|Doctor Faustus]],{{r|Captain America #192}} and her manipulative skills only grew under the tutelage of Faustus. This allowed her to pave her way to [[Lloyd Bloch (Earth-616)|Lloyd Bloch]], the original [[Moonstone]]. Drugging Lloyd with hallucinogens, Sofen persuaded him into giving her the [[Moonstones|Moonstone]], the [[Kree]] device that granted him immense powers.{{r|Incredible Hulk #229}} As the new '''Moonstone''', Karla became a prominent super-criminal, being recruited into [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] and facing the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] on several occasions.{{r|Avengers #222}} When the Avengers went missing, the Masters of Evil pretended to be super-heroes, naming themselves the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]]. Moonstone reinvented herself as the fake super-hero named [[Meteorite]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #449}}{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 1}} 

The Thunderbolts' hoax ultimately leaned them into genuine heroic activities.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 12}} Moonstone then became romantically involved with [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], who had taken control of the Thunderbolts to encourage them to be heroes.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 30}} However, Moonstone's villainous side flourished again when the Thunderbolts' leadership fell into [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s hands.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 110}} When Osborn decided to create his own [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]] team, Moonstone was invited to the team as Ms. Marvel.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 1}} Through the years, Moonstone was a member of several iterations of both the Thunderbolts and the Dark Avengers.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 144}}{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 184}}{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 1}}{{r|Punisher Vol 12 13}}

More recently, Moonstone seized control of a health facility in order to carry on experiments to raise the dead. Her experiments affected [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Monica Rambeau]]'s powers and [[Strikeforce (Earth-616)|Strikeforce]] investigated Moonstone's activities. She was defeated by the Strikeforce and incarcerated at the [[Ravencroft Institute]].{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 5|6}} However, since Norman Osborn was in charge of Ravencroft, Moonstone became part of Ravencroft's staff.{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 1}}

| History                 = 
===Early Life===
Karla Sofen grew up the daughter of [[Marion Sofen (Earth-616)|Marion Sofen]] a maid to a privileged family. She was forced to be a "playmate" to [[Deanna Stockbridge (Earth-616)|Deanna Stockbridge]], the family's daughter who was her age. Deanna saw Karla as a true friend, but Karla chaffed at being so close to wealth but being unable to call it her own. Still, she developed a talent for manipulating the naïve Deanna for her own amusement. Karla graduated college thanks to her mother working multiple jobs to support her education, and promised she would never be in the same situation herself.{{r|Thunderbolts #25}}

[[File:Karla Sofen (Earth-616) from Captain America Vol 1 192 0001.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Karla Sofen's first appearance from {{cl|Captain America #192}}]]
After becoming a psychologist, Karla enjoyed manipulating her patients for her own ends. Since she couldn't afford for her jealous housewife patient to be "cured" of her paranoia just yet, Karla called the house pretending to be a lover of her patient's husband in order to keep her coming back for more sessions.{{r|Thunderbolts #-1}} Karla trained under the tutelage of the criminal [[Johann Fennhoff (Earth-616)|Doctor Faustus]]. She even assisted Doctor Faustus in his grandiose attempt to take control of [[Manhattan]] Island. Faustus' plans never came to fruition however, due to the efforts of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. As Cap rounded up Faustus' men, Sofen hid herself inside the baggage compartment of the doctor’s private 747, thus evading capture.{{r|Captain America #192}}

===Moonstone===
She later used her psychiatric credentials to gain access to the prison cell of [[Lloyd Bloch (Earth-616)|Lloyd Bloch]] – the original Moonstone. Using hypnosis, she convinced Bloch that he was in fact a hideous, loathsome monster. The psychological trauma was so severe that it caused his body to reject the moonstone within him. Energized by the emotional rush, Karla was able to absorb the essence of the moonstone through a sheer act of will. The intensity of the transfer was so great that it even granted Karla the ability to absorb Bloch's Moonstone armor into her own bodily tissue. With Bloch now powerless, Karla Sofen became the new Moonstone.{{r|Incredible Hulk #229}}

[[File:Karla Sofen (Earth-616) from Incredible Hulk Vol 1 228 001.jpg|right|thumb|200px]]
A short time later, Moonstone decided to hire herself out to the subversive organization known as the [[Corporation (Earth-616)|Corporation]]. The Corporation sent Moonstone on a mission to [[Gamma Base]] in [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]] to purloin a top-secret piece of military hardware known as a Gammavator. She gained access as Dr. Sofen by offering professional help to fellow psychiatrist [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Leonard Samson]], who had been impressed by Sofen's heterodox attitude at the [[Utrecht]] Conference. Once in Gamma Base, she opposed the gamma-spawned monster, the incredible [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]. At first, Moonstone was able to provoke the Hulk into a savage frenzy, thereby earning her the sympathy of psychiatric colleague [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Doc Samson]], but before long, the Hulk overpowered Moonstone, exposing her identity of Dr. Karla Sofen.{{r|Incredible Hulk #228|229}}

Afterwards, Senator [[Eugene Stivak (Earth-616)|Eugene Stivak]], a Corporation member himself, came to the base, and once hearing the Hulk had resurfaced in California, asked Sofen to come along.{{r|Incredible Hulk #231}} They would then go to the Corporation West Coast Headquarters on [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]], where both the Hulk's alter ego Bruce Banner and [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] were being held captive. Once Captain America and [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Marvel Man]] arrived to save Falcon and Banner changed into the Hulk, a battle ensued that once it was clear that the Corporation had lost, Moonstone escaped.{{r|Captain America #230}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #232}}

With problems to get criminal work following the Corporation's dissolution, Moonstone attacked [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Dr. Connors']] lab at [[Empire State University]] and stole the portable [[Doc Connors' Enervator|Enervator]] in order to enhance her powers. During a subsequent fight against [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], Moonstone lost the Enervator, and the device was apparently destroyed in a building's wreckage.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 61}}

===Blackout===
[[File:Clinton Barton (Earth-616) and Masters of Evil (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 222 001.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Meeting Hawkeye]]
Moonstone was recruited by [[Elihas Starr (Earth-616)|Egghead]] to join his Masters of Evil. She acted as his field leader during his campaign against Henry Pym.{{r|Avengers #222}} When Egghead was killed and the scam went south, Karla eagerly volunteered to testify about how Egghead framed Hank Pym for various crimes...in exchange for a reduced sentence.{{r|{{cl|Avengers #228}}-[[Avengers #229|229]]}} She was held at [[Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. (Earth-616)|Project Pegasus]] for study. During a diversion elsewhere within Project Pegasus, another prisoner, [[Marcus Daniels (Earth-616)|Blackout]], managed to escape his containment cell. Karla managed to manipulate Blackout into deeply and instinctively trusting her, and they made their escape despite the Avengers' presence.{{r|Avengers #236|237}}

Moonstone used her energy powers to ascertain where they were and helped Blackout navigate them out of the Darkforce dimension to the Earth's moon. Moonstone hoped to augment her superhuman powers on the Moon's surface, but before she could do so, members of the Moon's resident race, the [[Inhumans (Race)|Inhumans]], aided by the mutant [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]], overpowered the two escaped criminals. Blackout and Moonstone were taken back to Earth and were returned to captivity at Project: Pegasus.{{r|Dazzler #32}}

===Masters of Evil===
Years later, Dr. Sofen joined the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]].{{r|Avengers #222}} She was a part of the group that participated in the infamous siege on [[Avengers Mansion]].{{r|Avengers #273}} While fleeing from [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], Moonstone slammed into the side of a mountain and broke her neck, remaining hospitalized for some time.{{r|Avengers #277}}

Following her recovery, Moonstone would again fight Captain Marvel in Brazil, where Karla had been hired to smuggle stolen Stark Tech to a local gangster.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 2 1}} Karla was then imprisoned in [[Vault (Prison)|The Vault]], later taking part in an attempted breakout started by [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]].{{r|Avengers: Death Trap, The Vault Vol 1 1}} During her captivity, Sofen was targeted by the original Moonstone, Lloyd Bloch, who had gained new powers but still sought revenge, first while she went to court,{{r|Captain America #379}} and later as he was brought into the Vault.{{r|Avengers: Unplugged Vol 1 1}} Sofen intended to serve the rest of her sentence, but she'd soon change her mind.{{r|Thunderbolts Annual Vol 1 1997}}

===Thunderbolts===
[[File:Karla Sofen (Earth-616) from Thunderbolts Vol 1 6 001.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Karla as Meteorite]]
When most of the world's heroes disappeared after the [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]] crisis, Sofen again teamed with [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]], who broke her out of the Vault. Under the guise of Meteorite, she was a founding member of the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], a team of super-villains masquerading as heroes to gain the trust of the people long enough for Zemo to steal sensitive [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] files.{{r|Thunderbolts Annual Vol 1 1997}} Eventually, their cover was broken, but Karla joined most of her teammates in sustaining the Thunderbolts as a true superhero team.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 10|17}}

[[File:Karla Sofen (Earth-616) and Clinton Barton (Earth-616) from Thunderbolts Vol 1 38 001.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Surprising Barton while he was climbing]]
Relating to these wanna-be heroes, [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] asked to join the team and help them turn to the good side of the law.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 20|21}} Although initially reluctant, they agreed to follow his lead and Karla even began a romantic relationship with Clint.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 30}} With time, the Thunderbolts came to be viewed as true heroes.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 34}} Because the Thunderbolts operated outside the law and Clint lost his "Avenger's Privileges" when he went over to lead them, he made a deal with the CSA so that he would go to jail but the Thunderbolts would be pardoned for their past crimes. As a result of the pardon some of the Thunderbolts went over to the V-Battalion which was being secretly led by Zemo while others like Karla went back to civilian life.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 50}} 

[[Franklin Hall (Earth-616)|Graviton]] approached Karla about training him and she agreed. {{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 53}}  During the training, Graviton secretly levitated a pebble and used it to murder Karla's childhood "playmate," Deanna Stockridge.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 54}} Graviton then decided to terraform the world in his image and suspended all the heroes into orbit to trap them. Therefore, the Thunderbolts were the only ones left to confront him. {{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 57}} Karla eventually sided with the Thunderbolts and Graviton revealed what he did to Deanna in an attempt to intimidate her. While Karla looked visibly shaken she stated that her death was meaningless to her.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 58}} During the battle, an alien invasion occurred because they leeched some of Graviton's power to open a gateway. Graviton stopped them and in the process sent all the Thunderbolts except [[Melissa Gold (Earth-616)|Songbird]] into [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Counter-Earth]].

On Counter-Earth, she obtained a second Moonstone through deception which increased her power tremendously.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 68}} Eventually, the Thunderbolts were able to return back to Earth and went through a roster change with Zemo becoming the leader again.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 75}}

Zemo decided to enact his Project: Liberator which caused a conflict between the Avengers and Thunderbolts. During the battle, Karla became unstable and as a result, the [[Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|Fixer]] managed to develop a multi-spectrum phase scrambler to disrupt Karla's intangibility. Hawkeye was then forced to combine it with a special arrow to inhibit her gravimetric field and fired it at Karla which rendered her tangible and catatonic. The [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] was then able to phase through her and removed her moonstones.{{r|Avengers/Thunderbolts Vol 1 6}}

[[File:Karla Sofen (Earth-616) from Ms Marvel Vol 1 46 0001.jpg|180px|thumb|right|New team, new costume]]
With Karla still comatose from these events, Baron Zemo gained control of the moonstones. From that point on, he manipulated her to do his bidding for him; her mind however, was still not functional.{{citation}} This changed after Songbird sent Zemo into a whirlwind of cosmic time/space releasing Sofen from his control. Her body was retrieved by the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities (Earth-616)|Commission on Superhuman Activities]] and remained in one of their facilities. Songbird was mentally linked through the moonstones' power when betraying Zemo. Karla and her teammate came out of their individual comas, with Karla mentally stable and her powers under control with one of the moonstones in her possession again.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 109}}

Sofen became the field leader of [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s Thunderbolts, which were sponsored by the U.S. Government in the conclusion of the Superhuman [[Civil War]]. Although she was initially uninterested, a blackmail from Norman Osborn threatening to remove her moonstone from her body left her with little choice. Although she served her function on the team, she proved less-than-effective as the team leader (she tried to rush through the Thunderbolts' first mission to have sexual intercourse with one of the dockworkers at [[Thunderbolts Mountain]]).{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 110|111}}

Moonstone was among four Thunderbolts members present during an attack on Thunderbolts Mountain by a renegade [[Skrulls|Skrull]] sleeper agent [[Khn'nr (Earth-616)|Khn'nr]] who had taken the form of Captain Marvel but had refused to follow his programming and had pledged to defend the human race.{{r|Secret Invasion #1}} During the battle, Khn'nr revealed that her stone was of [[Kree]] origin, and used his energy-controlling abilities to shut it down.{{r|Thunderbolts #122}} Later, [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]] tried to kill Songbird under Osborn's orders. Songbird managed to get into the Zeus aircraft, and blew up part of the Thunderbolts' mountain headquarters. Moonstone survived because Bullseye had warned her to go intangible, and walked away from the team.{{r|Thunderbolts #127}}

===Dark Avengers===
Norman Osborn gave her a spot on the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]]. She was given the codename and [[Ms. Marvel's Suit|original costume]] (reclaimed from [[Tsu-Zana (Earth-616)|Ultra Girl]]) of Ms. Marvel after [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol Danvers]] had refused to follow Osborn.{{r|Dark Avengers #1}} On the Dark Avengers' first mission, the new Ms. Marvel attacked [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]] by blasting her off her dragon, causing her to die in the present.{{r|Dark Avengers #4}}

[[File:Ms. Marvel Vol 2 39 Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Karla as Ms. Marvel]]
Osborn forced all of the Dark Avengers to undergo Psych Evaluations. After going through some of Karla's memories psychically, Dr. Gerald Wright discovered the memories of [[Marion Sofen (Earth-616)|her mother]]'s death were locked behind a "Hulk shaped door". He had come to kill the Dark Avengers because they were all made up of criminals, and he made Karla begin choke herself to death. As Karla was choking herself, she tricked him by getting him to go back into her head where she revealed she had killed her mother and hated being seen as a criminal and a failure. After Karla broke free, she asked him if he was prepared to do what she did and shot his right arm off and possibly choked him to death.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 38}}

After being told by Norman Osborn to find [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], Karla sorted through the original Ms. Marvel's A.I.M. leads and took out an A.I.M. cell in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia]]. There she found baby M.O.D.O.C.'s, enhanced to warp reality. They communicated with her telepathically, telling her that they need Ms. Marvel to save them. It was unclear if they are controlling her, or if she genuinely cared about them, but Karla took them back to her room in the [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] for safekeeping. Almost immediately her room was blown apart by a strange yellow being.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 39}} With the aid of [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Venom]], [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Noh-Varr]] and Iron Patriot, Karla managed to defeat the mysterious being and after a meeting with the Dark Avengers, the babies were moved to [[Mount Charteris|Thunderbolt's Mountain]] where they were stolen by [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] on behalf of A.I.M.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 40}}

Later while flying through the city, Karla came across a green version of Ms. Marvel's lightning bolt on the side of a building. Karla went back to the Avengers Tower where Osborn informed her Deadpool stole the baby M.O.D.O.C.s. Karla confronted him in [[Los Angeles]]. After defeating him, Karla came across the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] and four of the mysterious beings, each one a different color, in an underground A.I.M. base. Trying to save the babies, Karla was too late to reach them as [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] hooked them up to a machine. The four mysterious beings then merged and reform Carol Danvers, the original Ms. Marvel.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 41}} Refusing to let her title be taken away, Karla attempted to pound Danvers, but strangely, no matter what she hit her with, Danvers survived each and every blow.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 42}} Eventually, it was discovered that Danvers had a counterpart named Catherine Donovan, who, in close proximity, allowed Danvers to be invulnerable. Donovan, revealed to be a creation of the Storyteller, was killed by Osborn, but then managed to invade Karla's mind as she is fighting Danvers. While trapped in her own body, Sofen is forced to confront her own identity and retakes her Moonstone mantle. As Moonstone, Sofen is able to expel Donovan's consciousness which merges with Danvers upon exit, thus making Ms. Marvel whole again. However, during their battle, Carol uses her own powers to remove the moonstone from Sofen, depowering her in the process. She tells Karla that she learned a great deal about her while in her mind and offers her a chance at redemption. Knowing she will die in 72 hours without the moonstone's support, Carol hides it at the gravesite of Sofen's mother and gives her the opportunity to reexamine her life and stand against Osborn. Sofen finds the moonstone at her mother's grave, and she smashes the headstone.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 46}}

It is shown that, at some point, Karla started to feel very attracted to [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]]. It didn't take long for the two to start flirting with each other and something more sparked in Karla. As an M.D. in psychiatry, Karla started to get fascinated with the mysterious, brilliant and terrible personality of Daken and how she couldn't predict what he was going to do next. Karla demonstrated romantic feelings for Daken, but after a conversation with the mutant, Sofen realized that he was a liar and their relationship and the relation of Daken with the Dark Avengers was nothing but a way for Daken to have fun and achieve his goals. Still interested in Daken but disillusioned, the intimacy of the two turned cold at this point.{{r|Dark Wolverine #81}}

Karla was sent out by Osborn to help quell the riots in [[San Francisco]] along with the other Dark Avengers and [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] Outside the Castro Theatre, she took out [[Nekra Sinclair (Earth-616)|Nekra]] and [[Joanna Cargill (Earth-616)|Frenzy]] much to the surprise of [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]], [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]], and [[Roxanne Washington (Earth-616)|Bling]].{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1}} Later she came into conflict with [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], accusing her of attacking an unconscious H.A.M.M.E.R. agent and viciously attacked her, though Rogue managed to trick her and escape.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #226}}

===Siege===
Prior to the [[Siege of Asgard]], Moonstone was flirting with Bullseye,{{r|Dark Avengers #10}} and was caught having sex with him in the Avengers Tower meeting room in front of H.A.M.M.E.R agents as [[Victoria Hand (Earth-616)|Victoria Hand]] and Norman Osborn watched on a security camera. This act was perceived as an act of rebellion from Karla against Norman Osborn's rule over the Dark Avengers. Norman sent Victoria Hand to deal with the situation. Hand confronted Moonstone and Bullseye with a group of H.A.M.M.E.R agents. Moonstone disobeyed Hand's orders, which prompted Hand to take out an alien weapon to shoot Moonstone, knocking her unconscious.{{r|Dark Avengers #14}} Moonstone was later approached by Venom who told Karla that he had been waking up 'sticky' after dreams and was wondering if she could help him. At first, she looks disgusted at Mac Gargan's attempts to approach her. While this is happening, Daken walked up to her and called her 'sweetheart'. Karla wrapped her arm around Venom's arm and spurned Daken in the process.{{r|Dark Avengers #15}}

During the Siege of Asgard, Moonstone was seen helping Osborn defeat [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]].{{r|Siege #1}} She was seen being chased away by [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]], turning intangible to avoid the shots fired at her. Moonstone was one of the on-lookers when [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] tore [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]] in half.{{r|Siege #2}} She was standing beside Norman Osborn when the New Avengers, [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]], and [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] led by Steve Rogers arrived to assist the [[Asgardians]]. Captain America hit Osborn with his shield as Karla retreated, prompting her to say "Well, I sure as @#$% saw this coming!" as she engaged in personal combat with Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers). Karla won the exchange when Osborn interfered with the fight by blasting Ms. Marvel with an energy beam. When Osborn reverted back to his Green Goblin persona after being defeated by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and Captain America, Karla and Bullseye are seen in the distance. Both of them come to the realization that it would be a good time to leave the battle.{{r|Siege #3}}

Moonstone, along with the other members of the Dark Avengers, was arrested by the Avengers. After Captain America does away with Norman Osborn, Moonstone and Bullseye took the opportunity to attempt an escape. Carol Danvers gave chase to Moonstone, only to have Karla fire on her with an energy blast. When it seemed she had escaped, Iron Man appeared and punched her, knocking her out. At the same time, Bullseye was struck down by [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]], sending the two villains falling unconscious to the ground, thus ending Moonstone's career as an "Avenger."{{citation}}

===Heroic Age===
[[File:Karla Sofen (Earth-616) Thunderbolts Vol 1 163.png|thumb|180px|right]]
Imprisoned on the superhuman prison known as the [[Raft]], Moonstone was one of the initial recruits selected for a new Thunderbolts program led by Luke Cage.{{r|Thunderbolts #144}} [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]] took a liking to her.{{r|Thunderbolts #145}}

She escaped together with several other inmates who were members of the Thunderbolts. Due to a failure of the teleportation technology of their tower (caused by Man-Thing), the tower began to move in time as well as in space. They ended up in [[World War II]] teaming up with the [[Invaders]] to battle the [[Nazis]].{{r|Thunderbolts #163|165}} They next ended up in Victorian [[London (England)|London]],{{r|Thunderbolts #166|168}} and then went even further back in time to [[Arthur Pendragon (Earth-616)|King Arthur's]] court of [[Camelot]].{{r|Thunderbolts #169}}

They eventually bounced back to the time of the original Zemo lead Thunderbolts team.{{r|Thunderbolts #170|172}} The Fixer caused a collapse in reality after killing his younger self, which forced him to assume his younger self's place. She returned to the future with the rest of the Thunderbolts.{{r|Thunderbolts #173|174}}

===Dark Earth===
Moonstone and the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]], which had temporarily replaced the Thunderbolts during their time-traveling adventure, were later loaded onto a transport ship, escorted by [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|John Walker]] and Skaar to be taken to federal prison. When an explosion hit their ship, [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]] panicked and opened a wormhole. They found themselves stranded in an alternate Earth. In this world, all the major superheroes had become warlords, fighting over a New York City divided into factions.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 184}}

Moonstone and Skaar were captured and enslaved by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-13584)|Doctor Strange]], with Karla being given the appearance of Carol Danvers once again, albeit in her [[Captain Marvel]] identity this time, to attack [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-13584)|The Thing]]'s forces as the recently-deceased [[Carol Danvers (Earth-13584)|Carol Danvers]] of this world, who had been a member of Iron Man's forces. Strange took direct control of Moonstone's body to attack and provoke The Thing's army, tricking him into attacking Iron Man's forces in retaliation and break a truce.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 185}} Moonstone then confronted Skaar, who was being controlled by Strange to attack Iron Man's forces on behalf of The Thing's.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 186}}

The Thing's forces brought Moonstone to his base, to use her as a gladiator against his monstrous creatures. After defeating most of his army, The Thing had Moonstone disintegrated.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 187}} However, Karla survived due to her phasing abilities, which had kicked back in after the nanites suppressing it were neutralized as a secondary effect of Strange's magic. Moonstone also discovered Strange's slave spell was weakened when she was intangible, and used this to her advantage to go back to Iron Man's territory to rescue the Dark Avengers, starting with [[Ragnarok (Earth-616)|Ragnarok]].{{citation}}

Meanwhile, Doctor Strange had been killed by [[Ai Apaec (Earth-616)|Ai Apaec]], completely freeing both Skaar and Moonstone from his control.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 189}} The Dark Avengers regrouped and learned that the world they ended up in was created as a consequence of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]]'s temporal manipulations, a pocket universe that was about to collapse due to the presence of the Dark Avengers from the real timeline. The Dark Avengers attacked the A.I.M. outpost monitoring the pocket universe, and used their portal to return to the real world. Under the influence of [[June Covington (Earth-616)|Toxie Doxie]], John Walker refused to bring the Dark Avengers to federal custody as it was originally planned, and decided to keep the Dark Avengers together as a team.{{r|Dark Avengers #190}}

===Pleasant Hill===
At some point in time, Moonstone was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. and incarcerated at [[Pleasant Hill]], their newest super-prison where its inmates had their appearances and memories tampered with by a sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] named [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]], so they could be turned into model citizens.<!-- {{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Alpha Vol 1 1}} -->

When the Fixer freed himself from Kobik's control and did the same to [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]], Zemo began to amass an army of villains to have revenge on S.H.I.E.L.D., one of the initial recruits was Moonstone. After recruiting a handful of villains, Zemo unleashed a coordinated assault on Pleasant Hill, spiraling the town into chaos.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Alpha Vol 1 1}}

Moonstone remained as one of Zemo's closest allies during the conflict, and remained close to him until the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] were finally able to round up the escapees.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Omega Vol 1 1}}

===Winter Soldier's Thunderbolts===
[[File:Thunderbolts Vol 3 3 Adams Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Karla with the New Thunderbolts]]
After escaping Pleasant Hill, Moonstone joined [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]]'s new Thunderbolts alongside Atlas, Mach-X, Fixer, and [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]]. The team continued Nick Fury's Man on the Wall mission in a team format. When on a mission to investigate alien pods in Georgia, Moonstone questioned and challenged Winter Soldier's authority by saying that anyone with her moonstone and powers should be in charge of the team, which led Kobik to rip the stone from her chest.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 1}} Thinking it was all a game, Kobik claimed to be the new leader of the Thunderbolts, until Bucky shouted at her and urged her to return the stone and heal Karla.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 2}}

Kobik saved Moonstone from dying and apologized for her behavior,{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 2}} but Karla developed a profound hatred for the cosmic being, which ultimately led her to betray the team for Zemo and let Kobik get captured.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 10}}

===War of the Realms===
After the [[Frost Giants]] took over North America during the [[War of the Realms]], Moonstone arranged a deal with [[Laufey (Earth-616)|Laufey]] that she would supervise the captivity of [[Ymir (Earth-616)|Ymir]] and the creation of [[Ice Giants]] in exchange for keeping the women of Florida as her servants. The operation was eventually crashed by four size-shifting heroes disguised as giants - Sofen's ex-Thunderbolts teammate Atlas, along with [[Thomas Foster (Earth-616)|Goliath]], [[Raz Malhotra (Earth-616)|Giant-Man]] and [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] - and one of her captives who had equal powers, Ant-Man's daughter [[Cassandra Lang (Earth-616)|Stinger]]. Karla attempted to preserve Ymir's confinement until Atlas convinced her to drive away the Ice Giants in the stronghold. While the heroes liberated Ymir, who returned to his home realm, Karla escaped.{{r|Giant-Man Vol 1 3}}

===Thunderbolts vs. the Punisher===
[[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s leader Baron Zemo and [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Mayor Fisk]] came up with a plan to deal with the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] once and for all. Along with other villains, Moonstone was recruited by Zemo to join a new incarnation of the Thunderbolts. She was introduced at a press conference with the other members as Citizen V pronounced that they would end the Punisher's reign of terror and restore order to the city of [[New York]]. However, Punisher teamed up with other heroes to counter his disadvantage, and once Zemo ran away Moonstone surrendered.{{r|Punisher Vol 12 13|16}}

===Weird Science===
[[File:Karla Sofen (Earth-616) from Strikeforce Vol 1 6 001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|As Dr. Sophien]]
Moonstone's next scheme began by stealing the digital consciousness of [[Ghost (Earth-616)|Ghost]]'s lover, which had been uploaded onto [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon Corporation]]'s servers. Using it as a bargaining chip, she convinced Ghost to aid her in her experiments to upload consciousnesses into the Internet, creating a digital afterlife. Knowing that she was using the bodies of her patients without their consent and with no intention of actually making sure her project worked, Ghost turned on Moonstone and aided the [[Strikeforce (Earth-616)|Strikeforce]] defeat her, in exchange for his lover's consciousness. After her defeat, Moonstone was sent to the [[Ravencroft Institute]], supposedly as a patient,{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 5|6}} but, since Norman Osborn was in charge of the facility, she actually joined Ravencroft's staff. As one of the people in charge, she was later part of an effort to contain a captive Punisher and then fought what seemed to be the [[Unwanted (Earth-616)|Unwanted]], but these were actually telepathically-generated illusions, while the Unwanted launched an invasion of Ravencroft from the institute's hidden basement.{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 1|5}}

| Powers                  = Karla's powers are the result of her fusion with a gravity stone designed by the alien [[Kree]]. After being absorbed into her body, the stone took on the form of energy that permeates her nervous system. Karla once acquired a second gravity stone, increasing her powers to new limits. However, she currently only possesses one stone and her abilities have reverted to their old levels.{{citation}}
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' Karla possesses superhuman strength sufficient enough to lift around 10 tons.{{citation}}
* '''Superhuman Speed:''' Karla is capable of running and moving at speeds that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.{{citation}}
* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Karla's musculature produces considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. She can physically exert herself at peak capacity for about 24 hours before fatigue begins to impair her.{{citation}}
* '''Superhuman Durability:''' Karla's bodily tissues are tougher and more resistant to certain forms of physical injury than those of a normal human. She is able to withstand great impact forces, such as being repeatedly struck with superhuman force, powerful energy blasts or falls from great heights, that would severely injure or kill an ordinary human though she would suffer little to no injury herself. However, she is as vulnerable to conventional ballistic and bladed weaponry as any ordinary human.{{citation}}
* '''Superhuman Agility:''' Karla's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.{{citation}}
* '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Her reflexes are heightened in a similar manner and are superior to those of the finest human athlete.{{citation}}
* '''Flight:''' Karla could also allow the Earth's gravitational pull to propel her through the air at high speeds. To the casual viewer this would make her appear to disappear or teleport.{{citation}}
* '''Minor Molecular Control:''' She can instantaneously change into/alter her costume.{{citation}}
* '''Intangibility:''' She can make herself and other persons intangible by reducing her or the person's body's specific gravity.{{citation}}
* '''Photokinesis:''' Karla possesses the ability to manipulate light to a limited degree. She can generate a blinding luminescence from every inch of her body or generate blasts of concentrated photons from her fists that are powerful enough to blow a hole in a steel plate.{{citation}}
* '''Gravity Manipulation:''' When Karla absorbed another gravity stone, it gave her the ability to control the gravitational forces, enabling her to move and otherwise manipulate matter, to create force fields, to increase gravity around a target and crush it, to generate miniature black holes, and even to transport objects through dimensional rifts.{{citation}}
| Abilities               = '''Expert Psychologist:''' Sofen is a trained psychiatrist.{{citation}}

'''Expert Hypnotist:''' She is particularly skilled in using hypnosis. Like her predecessor, Doctor Faustus, Moonstone has perfect pitch and modulation in her voice, and was even able to use these talents to cause [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Thunderbolt Ross]] to suffer a complete nervous breakdown.{{citation}}
