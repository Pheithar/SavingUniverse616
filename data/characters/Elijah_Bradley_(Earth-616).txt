===Origin===
'''Eli Bradley''' has a family legacy of heroes. After losing the secrets of the [[Super Soldier Serum]] when [[Abraham Erskine (Earth-616)|Dr. Erskine]] died, the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|United States Army]] still wanted to produce more [[Super Soldiers]] like [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]].{{r|Captain America Comics #1}} To this end, Col. Walker Price and [[Wilfred Nagel (Earth-616)|Dr. Wilfred Nagel]] took 300 African-American soldiers from [[Mississippi (State)|Mississippi]] to experiment upon. Only a handful of men survived the gruesome process, and only one of them survived the covert missions and assignments: [[Isaiah Bradley (Earth-616)|Isaiah Bradley]],{{r|Truth: Red, White & Black #1|#7}} Eli's grandfather.{{r|Young Avengers #4}} His uncle, [[Josiah al hajj Saddiq (Earth-616)|Josiah X]], continued the family tradition, enlisting in [[Vietnam War]]. Later he even took up Isaiah's old [[Captain America]] uniform and joined the [[Crew (Earth-616)|Crew]].{{r|Crew #5}} Before Isaiah received the Super Soldier Serum, he fathered [[Sarah Gail Bradley (Earth-616)|Sarah Gail]], Eli's mother. Because of this Eli was born with no superhuman abilities.{{r|Young Avengers #4}}

===Young Avengers===
Shortly after the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] had [[Avengers Disassembled|disbanded]], a [[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|younger version of Kang the Conqueror]] traveled to the present era, with the goal of stopping his future self. Unsuccessful in his attempts to contact the Avengers, he downloaded the [[Vision (Earth-616)|The Vision]]'s programming and operating system from the [[Avengers Mansion|remains of the destroyed Avengers Mansion]]. Among the Vision files, he found the [[Avengers Fail-Safe Program]]. Dubbing himself [[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|Iron Lad]], he began to seek Avengers recruit in the [[New York City]] area. One of these recruits was [[Josiah al hajj Saddiq (Earth-616)|Josiah X]], Eli's uncle. However, Josiah had been out of contact with his family for years. Eli lied to Iron Lad, claiming to be a Super Soldier due to a {{WP|blood transfusion}} from his grandfather, and volunteered for Iron Lad's team. Eli then began using the illegal [[Mutant Growth Hormone|Mutant Growth Hormone (MGH)]] pills to fabricate superhuman abilities. Wearing a costume very similar to that of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]'s original sidekick, [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky]], Eli donned a full cowl and a set of five-pointed throwing stars as '''Patriot''', and alongside his new teammates [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]], [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Asgardian]] and Iron Lad, formed the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]].{{r|Young Avengers #1}}{{r|Young Avengers #8|#9}}{{r|Young Avengers Special #1}}{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade - Young Avengers #1}}

After several weeks of training, the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] began taking on superhero missions.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade - Young Avengers #1}} Their second mission was an attempted to save two hundred guests at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral]] when they were taken hostage during [[Susan Bishop (Earth-616)|Susan Bishop']] wedding. Unfortunately, the Young Avengers were only successful in starting a fire and becoming hostages themselves. It was a bridesmaid, [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Kate Bishop]], that actually saved them using one of Patriot's own throwing stars. The Young Avengers were able, however, to escape the scene before the police arrived.{{r|Young Avengers #1}}

[[File:Elijah Bradley (Earth-616) from Young Avengers Vol 1 4 001.jpg|right|frame|Patriot armed with Cap's original shield]]

After the attack, at the [[Metro-General Hospital|hospital]], Kate was approached by [[Cassandra Lang (Earth-616)|Cassie Lang]], daughter of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers']] [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]]. Together the girls tracked down the Young Avengers at the ruins of the [[Avengers Mansion]], where the girls confronted the Young Avengers and invited themselves onto the team.{{r|Young Avengers #2}} Not long afterward, the Mansion was attacked by [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]].{{r|Young Avengers #3}} To join the battle, Kate donned gear from the Mansion such as [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird's]] [[Mockingbird's Battle Staves|Battle Staves]] and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]]'s [[Hawkeye's Bow|Bow]]. She also found the original [[Captain America's Shield]] for Patriot.{{r|Young Avengers #4}} After defeating Kang and saving the world, Kate and Cassie remained on as permanent members.{{r|Young Avengers #4|#5}}

[[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] ordered the team to disband and refused to train them. However, Kate used some of her family's money and connection to procure a [[Bishop Publishing|new lair]], costumes and weapons for the team.{{r|Young Avengers #5}} With [[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|Iron Lad]] gone, Patriot and Kate took on the unofficial roles of co-leaders. Patriot and Kate even shared some chemistry and competitiveness.

===Secret Identities and Family Ties===
Not long after entering their secret superhero lives, [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] discovered Patriot was using [[Mutant Growth Hormone|MGH]] to temporarily grant him superhuman powers.{{r|Young Avengers #7|#8}} After taking MGH, Patriot fought [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Hyde]] one-on-one before injecting him with an overdose of MGH and knocking him unconscious. After being forcibly calmed by Wiccan's magics, Eli woke up in recovery at [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]], with the new [[Vision (Jonas) (Earth-616)|Vision]] taking care of him. After Eli revealed the true origins of his powers, he quit the team.{{r|Young Avengers #8|#9}}

[[File:Elijah Bradley (Earth-616), Faith Shabazz (Earth-616), and Isaiah Bradley (Earth-616) from Young Avengers Vol 1 12 001.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Isaiah providing a blood transfusion for Eli]]
The other Young Avengers unsuccessfully attempted to get Eli to rejoin them. It wasn't until after Hulkling was captured by the [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]] that Eli rejoin them.{{r|Young Avengers #9}} During the subsequent battle between the [[Kree]], the [[Skrulls]] forces, the Young Avengers and the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], Patriot used himself to shield Captain America from gunfire and was severely injured.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 11}} After the battle Captain America rushed to the hospital to give Eli a blood transfusion only to discover "another Captain America", [[Isaiah Bradley (Earth-616)|Eli's grandfather]], had already given Eli his blood. Since the transfusion, Eli has gained physical attributes and powers of a real Super Soldier.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 1 12}}

===Civil War, Secret Invasion and Siege===
Along with the rest of his team, Patriot sided with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and the [[Secret Avengers (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] against the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], which led to the Superhero [[Civil War]]. 

When [[Secret Invasion|the Skrulls invaded Earth]], Patriot joined the other Young Avengers and [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]] on the front lines of the battle.{{r|Secret Invasion: Runaways/Young Avengers #1|#3}}

Patriot along with the other Young Avengers helped rescue the fallen from [[Asgard]] during the [[Siege]]. He and Hawkeye were briefly trapped under some rumble themselves leading to an argument and a kiss.{{r|Siege: Young Avengers #1}}

===Children's Crusade===
After [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan's]] powers overloaded and the Avengers decided to keep him under observation, Patriot and the other Young Avengers broke Wiccan out of holding and began the search for the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]. Patriot was extremely hesitant about the plan, but still accompanied the others. Accompanied by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], the team traveled to [[Transia]] and then to [[Latveria]], before discovering a depowered and amnesiac Wanda engaged to [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]. The rediscovery of Wanda did not go unnoticed though, as the Avengers soon arrived on the scene. A battle with Doom's [[Doombot|Doombot army]] soon broke out and was only stopped by the arrival of [[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|Iron Lad]].{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #1|#4}}

Iron Lad teleported the Young Avengers and Wanda into the time-stream. They all went into the past and met reanimated [[Jonathan Hart (Earth-616)|Jack of Hearts]], who was about to explode. After that Wanda remembered who she is, regained her powers and returned herself, the Young Avengers and [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Scott Lang]] into the present.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #5}} She then finally confirmed that Billy and Tommy are indeed her reincarnated sons.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #6}}

Wanda's increased powers were revealed to be the result of her gaining a connection to the life force itself. A ritual intended to undo the Decimation was interrupted by Patriot, leading to the powers being transferred to Doctor Doom. He intended to usher the world into a utopia, which he would rule. The Avengers and X-Men teamed up to defeat him, and in the process, Stature was killed by Doom, and the villain escaped after losing his powers when they overloaded.

Iron Lad proposed to save Stature through the Time-stream but Vision refused, ending with both of them battling each other and Iron Lad destroying Vision and then taking off to the time stream, even after Wiccan warned that this is the moment in time where he becomes Kang the Conqueror.

In the aftermath of the battles, Elijah left the team while all the remaining Young Avengers were officially named full-fledged Avengers,{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #9}} and moved to the Midwest.<ref>[[Tom Brevoort|Tom Brevoort]]'s [http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/post/103784649023/wheres-patriot-what-happened-to-eli-bradley statement]</ref> At some point in time, he moved to Arizona to work in voter registration, according to [[Rayshaun Lucas (Earth-616)|Shaun Lucas]].{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson Vol 1 24}} He was present during the marriage of Wiccan and Hulkling after the invasion of the Cotati on Earth {{r|Empyre: Aftermath Avengers Vol 1 1}}, as well as their initial elopement in Las Vegas.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 4}}

=== Wakanda Unbound===
Eli was present during [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther's]] return back to Wakanda and helped in the battle with [[Nick Fury (Earth-616)|Nicholas Fury Jr.]] and the second Patriot, [[Rayshaun Lucas (Earth-616)|Rayshaun Lucas ]], side by side.{{Citation}}
