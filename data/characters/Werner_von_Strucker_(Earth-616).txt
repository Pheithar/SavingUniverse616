===Early Life===
Werner von Strucker is the oldest son of [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] and the half-brother of twins [[Andrea von Strucker (Earth-616)|Andrea]] and [[Andreas von Strucker (Earth-616)|Andreas von Strucker]], also known as the [[Fenris (Earth-616)|Fenris Twins]]. He was born and raised in [[Germany]]. He lived a life of luxury and attended the best of schools. But could never live up to his father's expectations.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 14}}

===Hydra===
Werner took control of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] during one of his father's supposed deaths. He carried on his father's plan to use the [[Gnobians]] and alien race that crashed landed during [[World War II]] to take of the world. [[Wilhelm Schmidt (Earth-616)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] raised one of the creatures as his own naming him [[Lump (Gnobian) (Earth-616)|Lump]]. Schmidt brought Lump with him to visit Werner and tried to talk Strucker out of their plans for the [[Death's Head Squadron (Earth-616)|Death's Head Squadron]], but Strucker said that he had no choice, for his wife's sake he must destroy [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] and [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]].{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 1}} Werner captured [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents [[Alphonso Mackenzie (Earth-616)|Al MacKenzie]], [[Alexander Pierce (Earth-616)|Alexander Pierce]], and [[Network Nina (Earth-616)|Network Nina]] when they came too close to their base and placed them into the memory chamber.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 3}} The Death's Head Squadron attacked a [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Earth-616)|N.A.T.O.]] base at [[Fort Washington]], killing hundreds of soldiers. Werner continued to monitor the captives within the memory chamber, while planning to unleash a [[Kree]] missile.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 4}} Speaking through Schmidt, the Gnobian mother commanded the Death's Head Squadron to set out and fulfill Strucker's dreams.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 5}} They met with a group of Neo-Nazi's and slaughtered them believing them to be inferior. Network Nina linked minds with the mother and Lump, and together they regained her sanity, she used her abilities to destroy all the Death's Head, much to the annoyance of Werner.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 6}} His father was later resurrected by the death spores and together they faced Nick Fury.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 14}}

===Las Vegas===
Werner would use his influence to try to gain part of the territory of the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] after the man fell from power. The conference was set in [[Las Vegas]], where things did not go well.{{r|Daredevil #307}} He attended a meeting held by the [[Word (Red Skull) (Earth-616)|The Word]] along with representatives of [[Maggia (Earth-616)|The Maggia]], [[Hammer Industries (Earth-616)|Hammer Industries]], [[Fenris (Earth-616)|Fenris]], [[Tyler Dayspring (Earth-4935)|Mr. Tolliver]], [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]], [[Yakuza (Earth-616)|Yakuza]], [[Ulysses Lugman (Earth-616)|The Slug]], [[Silvio Manfredi (Earth-616)|Silvermane]], and the [[Secret Empire (Earth-616)|The Secret Empire]].{{r|Nomad Vol 2 4}} 

However the event was infiltrated by two spies who were in reality [[Louis Frohike (Earth-616)|Microchip]] and [[Mickey Fondozzi (Earth-616)|Mickey Fondozzi]], associates of the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]].{{r|Punisher War Journal #45}} They claimed to be Four and Eight, members of the [[Secret Empire (Earth-616)|Secret Empire]]. Werner didn't wanted to risk a rift with the Empire, thus declined to kill them. Via a spy, the Empire learned of the two prisoners. Coincidentally, the real Four and Eight had not shown up for the Kingpin division meeting.{{r|Nomad Vol 2 5}} The Secret Empire became convinced the two had turned traitor and sent Chainsaw and his Praetorians, a motorcycle gang, to attack the entire group.{{r|Punisher War Journal #46}}

===Death===
Werner survived the attack, attending a later meeting along with a brown-haired assistant. This assistant was really his father, Baron Von Strucker. This particular meeting degenerated into violence yet again, with Werner's half-siblings claiming to be the only worthy heirs to their father.{{r|Daredevil #308}} Later, while alone, Werner was slain by his father so as to regain power in Hydra. Werner's corpse was found by a super-powered vigilante named [[Terror (Shreck) (Earth-88194)|Terror]], who stole one of his eyes in order to gain information about the conference.{{r|Daredevil #309}}
