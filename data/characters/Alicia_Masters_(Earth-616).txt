===Early Life===
Alicia's father [[Jacob Reiss (Earth-616)|Jacob]] was killed when his partner [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Phillip Masters, the Puppet Master]], decided to destroy the laboratory where they worked together. Without his knowledge, Alicia and her mother, [[Marcia Deaton (Earth-616)|Marcia]], accompanied Jacob to the laboratory. In the explosion, Alicia was blinded, and Marcia died when she inhaled toxic gas. Feeling remorseful, Philip adopted the girl and swore at all costs to restore her vision, without success. 

===The Fantastic Four===
Alicia moved with her adopted father to [[Manhattan]] where she studied at a special school for the blind. Soon, Alicia discovered her passion for sculpture. Unfortunately, during that time Phillip became completely mentally unbalanced and tried to use a special clay for his own benefit. When the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] got involved, Alicia's very sharp senses detected the invisible Susan Storm and this allowed Phillip Masters to capture the Invisible Girl. Then he forced Alicia to pose as the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Girl]] in order to infiltrate the team, however she rebelled against him and instead became a friend of the Fantastic Four.{{r|Fantastic Four #8}} Alicia felt especially interested in the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]], not because of his appearance but his personality, and she became his girlfriend.{{r|Fantastic Four #10}}

[[File:Alicia Masters (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Vol 1 49 0001.jpg|left|thumb]]
The Fantastic Four once travelled back in time to ancient [[Egypt]] to retrieve a rare herb that had the ability to cure blindness. Although the heroes were able to find the herb in the possession of [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Rama Tut]] and managed to retrieve it, they were unable to bring the remedy back with them to the present because [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]'s [[Time Platform|time platform]] could not transport objects with radioactive properties.{{r|Fantastic Four #19}}

Alicia proved her value to the Fantastic Four during the FF's first encounter with the [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]]. [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|The Wizard]], [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]], [[Flint Marko (Earth-616)|Sandman]] and [[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Paste-Pot Pete]] defeated the Thing, Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl. Fortunately for the three of them, Alicia came along and found an unconscious Sue Storm lying on the floor. Alicia took Sue's [[Fantasti-Flare|flare gun]] and signaled [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Johnny Storm]]. The Human Torch saw her signal for help and as a result his three partners and Alicia were saved.{{r|Fantastic Four #36}}

===Silver Surfer===
When the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]], herald of [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]], first came to Earth he came across Alicia by chance. She sensed his inner nobility and pleaded with him to spare humanity. His long-dormant emotions were stirred by Alicia's beauty and spirit. The Surfer turned on Galactus and helped fight him off.{{r|Fantastic Four #49}} Galactus punished the Surfer by trapping him on Earth, erecting an energy barrier around the planet that was uniquely attuned to the Surfer.{{r|Fantastic Four #50}} The Surfer became a global wanderer, trying to adjust to his new home and understand its people. A short time later, he returned to see Alicia, only to find himself in a pointless skirmish with a jealous Thing who misunderstood Alicia's interest in the Surfer.{{r|Fantastic Four #55}}

===Lyja===
In a [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrull]] plot to infiltrate the Fantastic Four, Alicia was taken away by [[Paibok (Earth-616)|Paibok]] while another Skrull named [[Lyja (Earth-616)|Lyja]] impersonated her back on Earth. When encountering the Fantastic Four for the first time, Lyja was shocked to find the [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] had taken the place of the Thing, who her plan hinged on. The [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] reluctantly told her that Ben had chosen to stay on [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]], thinking that Alicia was heart-broken over the loss of her love. Lyja’s plans were in shambles, but she reacted quickly and turned to Johnny, who she intended to get close to as a confidant. However, Lyja fell in love with Johnny, and the two were later married in a private ceremony that the Puppet Master nearly broke up until he realized how happy his supposed daughter seemed to be. After Lyja's ruse was discovered, the real Alicia Masters was rescued from suspended animation by the Fantastic Four, unaware that any time had passed.

===Relationship with Silver Surfer===

Alicia Masters and Norrin Radd begin a romantic relationship when Norrin returned to Earth to regain his losing humanity. Like she had done once before, Norrin hoped seeing Alicia again would rekindle his emotions and connection to humanity {{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #123}}. Their subsequent adventures would lead to the development of romantic feelings between Alicia and Norrin. For a short time while in space Alicia was given a special super powered 'interstellar bodysuit' which allowed her to survive the harshness of space as well as see energy signatures {{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #144}}. When Galactus' new herald, [[Red Shift (Earth-616)|Red Shift]] targeted Earth to sate Galactus' hunger, Alicia and the Silver Surfer fly into space to stop the World Devourer {{r|Galactus the Devourer Vol 1 #1}}. Much to the horror of Alicia, Norrin once again accepts Galactus' demand for a herald as the price for sparing Earth {{r|Galactus the Devourer Vol 1 #5}}. After Galactus' defeat and death at the hands of Earth's superheroes and the [[Shi'ar Empire]], Alicia asked Norrin to return to Earth with her but he refused.{{r| Galactus the Devourer Vol 1 #6}}. He broke up with her so she could return to her life in New York and continue pursuing her art while he mourned alone for the death and betrayal of his former master while also investigating Galactus' final warning. 

During this time the Fantastic Four were seemingly killed defeating [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], Alicia acted as caretaker to [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] and the Invisible Woman's young son, [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin]] for a time.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 2}}

===Post Secret Invasion===
Following the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]] Alicia led a support group along with [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Leonard Samson]] for [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] members who were readjusting to their lives after they had been abducted and replaced by Skrulls.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #20}}

===Reconnecting with Ben Grimm===
When [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]] purchased the [[Baxter Building]] for its New York City office, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Dr. Peter Parker]] commissioned a statue of the Fantastic Four, along with Valeria and Franklin, to be sculpted by Alicia and placed in the lobby for all to see, since at the time they were all believed dead, with the exception of The Thing and the Human Torch.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 3}} While struggling with the loss of his family, Ben reignited his romance with Alicia. He eventually decided to move on, and decided to propose to her. She accepted before Ben could even finish the formalities. The ring was made out of a fragment of a magical gem Ben had been gifted by an ally of the Fantastic Four during their travels.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 1}}

The remaining members of the Fantastic Four returned to Earth shortly after Ben had proposed to Alicia. In light of this turn of events, Alicia suggested Ben to move the wedding forward,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 4}} and they married days later with a small ceremony in [[Benson]], [[Arizona (State)|Arizona]], where Ben's uncles lived.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 5}}
