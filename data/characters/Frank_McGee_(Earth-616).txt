Frank ended up making his way to [[New Attilan]]'s bazaar for sanctuary where he came upon [[Auran (Earth-616)|Auran]], a member of the original city's security force. Learning of his ability and experience as a cop, Auran and Frank became partners, with her giving him a new name, '''Nur'''. After stopping a sale of fake [[Terrigen Crystals]], they were summoned to the palace by [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Queen Medusa]] and tasked with the job of locating her husband, [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]], as the [[New Attilan Security Force (Earth-616)|New Attilan Security Force]].<!-- {{r|Inhuman Vol 1 7}} -->

Nur and Auran's search lead them to a nightclub where they started to canvas the area for clues to the Kings whereabouts. Due to Auran's acoustic abilities, they were able to locate Black Bolt since he had been in range of his brother [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]]' proximity. As Nur pulled out his weapon, Maximus used his mind control abilities to make Black Bolt speak, blowing up the entire room of the building in which they were standing.{{r|Inhuman Vol 1 7}}
