After he graduated from high school he ended up getting stuck in dead end jobs and menial labor. This all changed the day that he answered a want ad in the [[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Daily Bugle]] placed by millionaire [[Gregory Gideon (Earth-616)|Gregory Gideon]] to work as security at his factory in Long Island. {{r|Fantastic Four #136}} This security force was responsible for defending the factory when Gideon attempted to kidnap [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] and the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Girl]] of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], as well as their son [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]]. This was all part of a ploy to use his Eternity Machine to harvest cosmically powered genes in order to cure himself and his son [[Thomas Gideon (Earth-616)|Thomas]] of radiation poisoning. {{R|Fantastic Four #134}} However the rest of the Fantastic Four came to their rescue, the battle ending with the Eternity Machine destroyed, and Gergory Gideon dead. {{r|Fantastic Four #135}}

[[File:Andrew_Johnson (Slugger) (Earth-616)_as_the_Brain_from_Fantastic_Four_Vol_1_137.jpg|thumb|Johnson as the Brain. {{r|Fantastic Four #137}}]]Andrew survived but was bombarded with energies from the Eternity Machine. These energies attracted the [[Shaper of Worlds (Earth-616)|Shaper of Worlds]] who offered to use his vast powers to create the ideal world for Johnson. The resulting reality warp created a world that was a pastiche of 1950s culture where the [[Wild Ones (Earth-73836)|Wild Ones]], a biker gang of "Youthies" were constantly at war with the elderly and xenophobic [[Patriots (Earth-73836)|Patriots]]. They sought to obtain a powerful weapon called the [[Warhead (Construct) (Earth-73836)|Warhead]] a powerful weapon created by "The Brain" a man based off of [[Albert Einstein (Earth-616)|Albert Einstein]]. Initially, Johnson fashioned himself as the leader of the Wild Ones, calling himself the Wild One. {{r|Fantastic Four #136}} When the Fantastic Four, the Wild Ones, and the Patriots all went after the Warhead, an increasingly unhappy Johnson became the Brain himself to defend his version of reality. Ultimately, the Fantastic Four destroyed the Warhead. In the aftermath of the battle a previously unseen society of African-Americans that were living in squalor confronted the Patriots and demanded their civil rights. Pushing the 1950s inspired reality that Slugger so deeply wanted to move onto a metaphorical 1960s. In realizing that time had to move on, Slugger's world shattered and the Shaper deemed him unworthy of his gift. He stripped Johnson of his powers and left that world with [[Thomas Gideon (Earth-616)|Thomas Gideon]] as his new student. {{r|Fantastic Four #137}}

Slugger's subsequent activities are unknown.
