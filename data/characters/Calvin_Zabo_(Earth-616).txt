===Early Life===
Dr. Calvin Zabo was a morally abject but brilliant medical researcher who was fascinated by the effect of hormones on human physiology. One of his favorite stories was [[Robert Louis Stevenson (Earth-616)|Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s 1886 classic, ''[[Marvel Classics Comics Series Featuring: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Vol 1 1|Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''. He was convinced that the experiment in the story could actually be performed{{r|Journey into Mystery #99}} (and indeed Jekyll's story was a true one,{{r|Supernatural Thrillers #4}} although it had been reported as a fiction), and obsessed with the idea of unleashing his full bestial nature in a superhuman form. However, he needed money to do this so he robbed his various employers systematically. Though too intelligent to be caught, the medical community was suspicious of his tendency to always be employed by organizations which were subsequently robbed. He sought work as a surgeon in a hospital where [[Donald Blake (Earth-616)|Dr. Donald Blake]] was a directing physician, yet Blake would not allow him a job due to his history. Zabo was enraged that Blake would not give him the position, even though he did indeed intend to rob the organization. He swore revenge on Blake.{{r|Journey into Mystery #99}}

===Mr. Hyde===
Zabo was eventually successful in creating the [[Hyde Formula]], and turned into a huge, [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]-like creature he called "Mister Hyde", named after the Mr. Hyde in the book. In this new form he found he had vast superhuman strength, enabling him to crush cars and tear through steel as though it were made of cardboard. With his new superhuman powers he sought out Blake, who transformed into [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] and beat him senseless. In response, Hyde began committing robberies disguised as Thor.{{r|Journey into Mystery #99}} He next kidnapped Donald Blake and [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Jane Foster]] and even though he was once again defeated by Thor, he managed to escape because Foster had hidden Thor's hammer, fearing that if Hyde was captured, Blake would be killed by a time bomb Hyde had set.{{r|Journey into Mystery #100|101}}

===Daisy Johnson===
At some point Hyde fathered a daughter with a prostitute named Kim Johnson. The girl [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Daisy]], was put up for adoption after birth, subsequently manifesting superpowers due to her mother's [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] lineage.{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 7}} She eventually became a member of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] under the codename of Quake.

===Partnership with Cobra===
Hyde went into business as a full time professional super criminal and partnered himself with the [[Klaus Voorhees (Earth-616)|Cobra]] to get revenge upon Thor.{{r|Journey into Mystery #105|106}} With the Cobra, he was employed by Loki to kidnap Jane Foster, and they battled Thor again, but were defeated even though Loki had doubled their power.{{r|Journey into Mystery #110|111}}

Hyde and the Cobra next battled Daredevil.{{r|Daredevil #30|32}} They then teamed with the original Jester against Daredevil.{{r|Daredevil #61}}

Teaming with the Cobra again, Hyde attempted to acquire [[Cagliostro (O-Bengh) (Earth-616)|Cagliostro]]'s serum.{{r|Daredevil #142|143}} While serving in prison following this failed attempt, Hyde was ensnared by the mind control power of the [[Zebediah Killgrave (Earth-616)|Purple Man]], and forced to battle Daredevil in an arena alongside Cobra, the Jester, and the Gladiator.{{r|Daredevil #153|154}}

Eventually, tiring of their repeated failures, the Cobra elected to sever their partnership. He escaped from [[Ryker's Island]], taking the time to taunt Hyde before leaving. Hyde never forgave him for the slight.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #46}}

===Revenge===
Teaming with [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc]], Hyde blackmailed New York City with a hijacked super-tanker. Hyde attempted to destroy the entire city in order to kill Cobra. Eventually, he was defeated by Captain America with Batroc's aid.{{r|Captain America #251|252}}

At Hyde's lab, the criminal finally found a serum to revert him to his human self. However, it will make him human forever. The effects of the serum would be irreversible. Hyde decided to become human forever. At that moment, Daredevil crashed into the lab and startled Hyde. Hyde did not take the serum and noted that he, now, does not want to become human. His past superhero pursuers would find him, and as he would be a weak human, he could no longer defend himself. The two battle and Daredevil eventually lures him to subway station.

===Avengers: Standoff!===
Mister Hyde was later apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. and placed in [[Pleasant Hill]] which served as the most unlikeliest of prisons{{r|Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D. #6}} where the prisoners were transformed into mild-mannered versions of themselves by the sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]].{{r|Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hill Vol 1 1}} Hyde and the other prisoners were returned to normal by [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] and the [[Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|Fixer]] and joined Zemo in an assault to take over the town.{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson Vol 1 8}}{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Alpha Vol 1 1}} The takeover was eventually halted by the Avengers, [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]], and S.H.I.E.L.D. reinforcements.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Omega Vol 1 1}} While not shown, it can be presumed that Mister Hyde was defeated and transferred to a different prison.

Hyde was one of the few members of the Army of Evil that wasn't put in stasis by Hydra.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}} Instead, Hyde was put in charge of managing the detention facilities where the Inhumans were placed in as Hydra rounded them up if they failed to register with the government or posed a threat.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 17}} Months later, Hyde led a Hydra force against his daughter Quake and a [[Warriors (Earth-616)|ragtag team]] of Inhumans she assembled.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 #3}}

With assistance from [[Avengers (Hydra) (Earth-616)|Hydra's Avengers]], Quake and her team were captured and taken aboard a Hydra [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier|Helicarrier]]. Quake managed to cripple the Helicarrier with her seismic powers forcing Hyde and his force to evacuate, but not before capturing Quake's teammate [[Lunella Lafayette (Earth-616)|Moon Girl]].{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 #4}}

Hyde took Moon Girl and another Inhuman, [[Leer (Earth-616)|Leer]], whom Quake's team was searching for, to New Attilan where he kept them prisoner. The Warriors learned where Moon Girl was being held and head to New Attilan to rescue her. The Warriors then led a prison uprising against Hydra. Hyde escaped in a [[Hydra Jumpship]] with Quake as his prisoner. He tried to convince her to join forces with him, but before he could make a deal, the Warriors knocked his ship out of the air. After Hyde emerged from the wrecked aircraft, [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]] struck Hyde's pressure points, leaving Hyde immobilized for the next 10 days.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 #5}}

===Ravencroft===
Hyde was later transferred to the newly built [[Ravencroft Institute]].{{r|Ruins of Ravencroft: Dracula #1}} While there, he developed an obsession with the institute's security consultant [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]]. One day, he grabbed Jameson and tried to get him to transform into the Man-Wolf for his amusement. Hyde was quickly subdued by Jameson's fellow staff member [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] and taken to solitary confinement.{{r|Ravencroft #1}}

Still obsessed with Jameson, Hyde was from his cell in solitary by Ravencroft consultant [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] and gave him a shiv, wanting him to kill Jameson, though Osborn actually hoped Jameson would transform into Man-Wolf. When Hyde attacked Jameson, Jameson was able to stop Hyde's attack. After Hyde backhanded Misty Knight when she tried to stop him, Hyde was tackled by institute guard [[Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616)|Dennis Dunphy]] and prisoner [[Maxwell Markham (Earth-616)|Grizzly]]. However, Hyde's shiv accidentally hit Dunphy in the chest. Hyde was then subdued by prison guards.{{r|Ravencroft #3}}{{r|Ravencroft #5}}

| Powers                  = [[File:Mr Hyde (Earth-616).jpg|right|200px|thumb]]
* '''[[Hyde Formula]]:''' Any and all superhuman attributes Zabo has are due to consuming a formula of his own design specifically to transform him into a superhumanly powerful being. By consuming different mixtures of his transformation potion, Calvin Zabo can transform back and forth from his alter-ego of Mister Hyde. The chemical process is hormonal in nature, causing the cells of his anatomy to instantly manufacture mutated hormones that induce a physical transformation encompassing his entire figure. The transformation is excruciating, taking about 30 seconds, adds 7 inches and approximately 235 lbs of muscle and bone tissue to his frame. Aside from his greater physical size, the transformation process also stretches his skin, particularly his face to the point that he has a permanent sneer. Due to the process, Zabo's fingerprints in both his normal and Hyde forms are different.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #8}}
** '''[[Superhuman Strength]]:''' Hyde possesses superhuman strength, but the exact limits of his strength changed regularly. He is constantly modifying and improving upon his formula, producing different results, including adding other elements such as MGH.{{r|Young Avengers #7|8}} When his strength was measured around the time of the Masters of Evil strike on Avengers Mansion, he could lift (press) 50 tons.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 8}}
** '''[[Superhuman Stamina]]:''' Hyde's advanced musculature generates considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of an ordinary human. He can exert himself at peak capacity for about 24 hours before fatigue begins to impair him.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #12}}
** '''[[Superhuman Durability]]:''' Hyde's body is much harder and more resistant to conventional physical injury than the body of a normal human. He can withstand high caliber bullets, falls from great heights, exposure to extreme temperatures and pressures, powerful energy blasts, and tremendous impact forces without sustaining injury.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #12}}
** '''[[Healing Factor]]:''' While his body is highly durable, it is possible to injure him. If injured, his accelerated metabolism allows him to rapidly heal from mild to moderate injuries faster than a normal human. Ultimately, the full limits of his heightened healing abilities aren't known. However, it is believed that he is unable to fully regenerate severed limbs or missing organs should such injuries occur.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #12}}

* '''Hand to Hand Combat:''' Hyde is a formidable hand to hand combatant, though he's had no formal training. He tends to rely on street fighting techniques that allow him to make full use of his great strength.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #8}}

This is not 100% consistent, however, due to constant changes to the formula and Zabo's own bio-structure. At times he can trigger the change at will without using his formula, or has remained as Hyde indefinitely without reverting back or reapplying his formula.<ref>See Mr. Hyde's stint with the [[Thunderbolts]].</ref>
* He is also less intelligent as Hyde and is prone to savage, almost bestial rages in which he becomes reckless.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #231|232}}
