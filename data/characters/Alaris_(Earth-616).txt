| History                 = [[File:Alaris (Earth-616) from Inhumanity Vol 1 2 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Alaris and Gorgon vs. A.I.M.]] Alaris was an [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] with super-strength, fast reflexes, and bullet-proof skin. He was part of the delegation of Inhumans sent to [[Earth]] to study at a human college.  He was friendly and naive, coming across as a foreign exchange student in an average college setting. His genial attempts to assimilate American and Earth culture made Alaris quite charming. He was genuinely having fun, unaware that he was being taken advantage of and lacking understanding of people's reactions to him and of how his behaviour affected them. He genuinely enjoyed his time among humans and acclimated himself the most among them.{{r|Inhumans Vol 4 2|12}} During his time on Earth he became romantically interested in his fellow Inhuman [[Tonaja (Earth-616)|Tonaja]] but she turned him down and asked that they become friends instead as she was already romantically involved with [[Dewoz (Earth-616)|Dewoz]] back on [[Attilan]].{{r|Inhumans Vol 4 12}}

Alaris was part of a strike-force put together by [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] and [[Gorgon Petragon (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] in order to free the cocooned Inhumans from the terrorist organization [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]].{{r|Inhumanity #2}}
