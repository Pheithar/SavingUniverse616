===Original Iteration===
During the [[Vietnam War]], Project S.H.I.E.L.D. - the precursor of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] - excavated the body of [[Symbiote Dragons|an alien dragon]] made of [[Symbiotes (Race)|living darkness]], which they codenamed [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]]. As part of [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|a series of clandestine supersoldier programs]] intended to replace the MIA [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]],{{r|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}} a team led by [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] began experimenting on extracted samples of its biomass. Discovering that the samples could be bonded to lifeforms to create predatory monsters, immediately proceeding to human trials by bonding samples to a group of wounded soldiers.{{r|Venom Vol 4 2}}{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam Vol 1 1}}{{r|King in Black Handbook Vol 1 1}}

These symbiote-augmented super-soldiers were sent on black ops missions, but the primordial symbiote was indwelled by [[Knull (Earth-616)|a malevolent deity]] that possessed the ability to corrupt symbiotes and send them into feral rampages. Despite some initial success, the Sym-Soldiers quickly succumbed to their symbiotes' bloodlust, went insane, and began devouring Việt Cộng and American soldiers alike. Nick Fury subsequently declared the Sym-Soldiers a liability and contacted [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]] to assist him in hunting them down. They were joined by [[Rex Strickland (Earth-616)|Rex Strickland]], whose [[Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|symbiote]] had separated from him; but Fury subsequently attempted to kill Logan and Strickland by detonating a [[Life-Model Decoy]] so as to not leave any witnesses.{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam Vol 1 1}} Strickland was killed, but his symbiote survived and impersonated him, becoming an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.;{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}} while the other Sym-Soldiers were cryogenically frozen and the program was officially declared a failure and shut down.{{r|Venom Vol 4 1}}{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 4 1 003.png|thumb|left|In the thrall of Knull.]]
Following the collapse of S.H.I.E.L.D., the cryogenically-frozen symbiote super-soldiers and the primordial symbiote-dragon were being transported to a black box site to be terminated when the convoy was attacked by Venom - acting on behalf of Rex Strickland's symbiote, who wished to rescue its brethren. However, the super-soldiers' symbiotes were corrupted by the malevolent entity and killed their hosts before being absorbed into the primordial symbiote they had originated from.{{r|Venom Vol 4 1}}

===Legacy===

Following S.H.I.E.L.D.'s termination of the original Sym-Soldier Program, Weapon Plus appropriated the remaining personnel and samples of the Grendel symbiote, establishing the [[Project Venom (Earth-616)|Weapon V]] program - also known as [[Project Venom]]. Nick Fury's role in establishing the original Sym-Soldier Program led to him receiving credit as the founder of Weapon V,{{r|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}} though he was never actually involved.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}

Decades later, the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Army]]'s [[Overreach Committee (Earth-616)| Overreach Committee]] - under the command of [[Arlen Dunleavy (Earth-616)|General Arlen Dunleavy]] - employed [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]] (the host of the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]]) as a black-ops agent.{{r|Venom: On Trial Vol 1 3}} Assigned [[Daryll Smith (Earth-616)|Agent Darryll Smith]] as his handler, Venom was outfitted with a bomb to keep him under control and sent to eliminate threats like the Russian terrorists [[Sergei Yesenofsky (Earth-616)|Doctor Yes]] and [[Kostya Yesenofsky (Earth-616)|Red Flag]],{{r|{{cl|Venom: License to Kill Vol 1 1}} - {{cl|Venom: License to Kill Vol 1 3|3}}}} and the arachnoid cyborg [[Aurelio Santurce (Earth-616)|Teraknid]].{{r|{{cl|Venom: Sign of the Boss Vol 1 1}} - {{cl| Venom: Sign of the Boss Vol 1 2}}}} However, Venom grew disaffected with how Overreach Committee was treating him and went rogue.{{r|{{cl|Venom Finale Vol 1 1}} - {{cl| Venom Finale Vol 1 3|3}}}}

Years later, when the Venom symbiote was stripped from [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Mac Gargan]], the US Army rebooted the Sym-Soldier Program as [[Project Rebirth (Earth-616)#Project Rebirth 2.0|Project Rebirth 2.0]]. The initial volunteer, [[Cal Henricksen (Earth-616)|Cal Henricksen]], lost control of the symbiote and was killed,{{r|Venom Vol 2 1}} though [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Corporal Flash Thompson]] was successful in subduing the symbiote with the help of a [[Symbiote Inhibitor]] serum and became the black ops supersoldier known as [[Agent Venom]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #654}} Initially signed up for 20 missions, Agent Venom carried out several operations and quickly ran afoul of the [[Bennett Brant (Earth-616)|Crime Master]]'s criminal syndicate, but went AWOL after being made and having his loved ones threatened.{{r|Venom Vol 2 1|5}} Following the Spider-Island incident, Project Rebirth 2.0 was shut down by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Venom Vol 2 10}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 15}} However, the US government and military, inspired by Agent Venom's initial success, continued to pursue the use of symbiote super-soldiers.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}

General Brandon Duggan established PROJECT LIQUID with the intent of forming a team comprised of weaponized symbiotes. To this end, the [[Agony (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Agony]], [[Lasher (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Lasher]], [[Phage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Phage]], and [[Riot (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Riot]] symbiotes were recovered from [[Scott Washington (Earth-616)|Hybrid]]'s corpse and bonded to [[Mercury Team (Earth-616)|new military-trained hosts]]; and [[Tanis Nieves (Earth-616)|Scorn]] was recruited and given training to improve [[Scorn (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|her symbiote]]'s unique technopathic abilities. However, Duggan was unable to recruit [[Patrick Mulligan (Earth-616)|Toxin]] or [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom]] - the former having been killed by [[Blackheart (Earth-616)|Blackheart]], who took the [[Toxin (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Toxin symbiote]] for his own purposes; and the latter having given up the [[Anti-Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom symbiote]] to cure the [[Spider-Virus]].{{r|{{cl|Carnage, U.S.A. Vol 1 1}} - {{cl| Carnage, U.S.A. Vol 1 2|2}}}} Agent Venom, Mercury Team, and Scorn were deployed to subdue Carnage and successfully defeated him, with a sample of the Carnage symbiote being obtained by Scorn.{{r|{{cl|Carnage, U.S.A. Vol 1 3}} - {{cl|Carnage, U.S.A. Vol 1 5|5}}}} However, the human members of Mercury Team were eventually hunted down and slaughtered by Carnage, with the symbiotes bonding to the team's [[Lasher (War Dog) (Earth-616)|German Shepherd war-dog]] and going AWOL.{{r|{{cl|Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 3}} - {{cl|Deadpool vs. Carnage Vol 1 4|4}}}}

Following the Doverton Incident, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|FBI]] established the [[Anti-Symbiote Task Force (Earth-616)|Anti-Symbiote Task Force]] with the intent of capturing or killing Carnage; and forcibly recruited Eddie Brock - at the time the Toxin symbiote's host, who was assigned Agent [[Claire Dixon (Earth-616)|Claire Dixon]] as a handler.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 1}} Brock sacrificed the Toxin symbiote to stop Carnage from summoning [[Chthon (Earth-616)|an eldritch god]],{{r|Carnage Vol 2 15|16}} and became the de facto leader of the task force after Dixon's death. However, Brock went AWOL after re-bonding to the Venom symbiote,{{r|Venom Vol 3 5|6}} which the FBI had separated from Flash Thompson in an effort to reclaim it.{{r|Venom Vol 1 150}} Dixon, resurrected by the eldritch magic of the ''[[Darkhold]]'', resumed leadership of the Anti-Symbiote Task Force and attempted to capture Venom so that his symbiote and its soon-to-be-born spawn could be used as military assets once more.{{r|Venom Vol 1 164|165}}

Operating from the shadows, Weapon V appropriated resources developed by Project Rebirth 2.0 and other military and government-run symbiote supersoldier programs, using them to engineer weapons-grade symbiote bio-armor devoid of the "mental instability" that had rendered the Sym-Soldier prototypes a failure.<!--{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}-->

After Cletus Kasady bonded to the remnants of the original Grendel symbiote and began hunting current and former hosts, he attacked Weapon V's base and slaughtered most of the personnel present. The surviving members of Weapon V's Mars Team - led by [[Robert Urquhart III (Earth-616)|Robert James Urquhart III]] - attempted to avenge their comrades with the forced assistance of [[Clayton Cortez (Earth-616)|Weapon H]], but were betrayed by their head of R&D, [[Andrew Breen (Earth-616)|Dr. Andrew Breen]], and killed by Carnage.<!--{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}-->

Rather than destroy the remaining samples of the Grendel symbiote, the higher-ups at the [[Weapon Plus]] headquarters subsequently decided to put them in stasis until the threat posed by Carnage had been subdued.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}
