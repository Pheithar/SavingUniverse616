===Origin===
Like many of the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]]'s [[Sleepers (Robots)|other fail-safes]], this clone (created by [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]] in 1942 under the orders of the original when he suspected the Reich would be defeated during [[World War II]]) was meant to awaken in the changed landscape of the future where the Red Skull was just a forgotten menace of a fallen regime. He awoke to find the world in a turbulent period and ripe for conquest.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 2}}

[[File:Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616) and Charles Xavier (Earth-616) from Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 1 001.png|thumb|left|With [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]]'s brain]]
===Red Riot===
Seeing [[Avengers vs. X-Men|how mutants nearly destroyed the world]] convinced him that they were the threat. He searched the world and recruited exceptional individuals, forming a group of [[S-Men (Earth-616)|S-Men]] to combat the mutant menace. He also stole the brain of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] in order to gain his telepathic powers, reasoning that it would be best to use it than waste his time trying to gather relics and arcane objects which would only reveal his hand.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 1}}

After subjugating the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] and [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] to his will,{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 2}} Shmidt led an attack in New York to test his new mental abilities, forcing the citizens to turn on each other and clashing with the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 3}}{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 4}} This event became known as the "Red Riot" which stayed in the news for over two weeks.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 7}}{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 10}}

He founded [[Institute of Bio-Social Studies|I.B.S.S.]] through his puppet [[Marcus Glove (Earth-616)|Marcus Glove]], meant to be a vehicle for espousing his ideology. He cloaked his intentions with the rhetoric of hipster pop-culture and modern science.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 8}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 10}} While it did not work out as he hoped as he was stymied by the actions of Charles Xavier's own son [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]], it did secure more funding for him.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 11|12}}

===March to AXIS===
Knowing that his ally Arnim Zola was unlikely to have died,<ref>Arnim Zola seemingly died in {{cl|Captain America Vol 7 10}}</ref> he acted upon a promise and reached out to his old friend's daughter [[Jet Zola (Earth-616)|Jet Black]].{{r|All-New Marvel NOW! Point One Vol 1 1.NOW}}

He turned out to be right and greeted his friend and benefactor when Zola returned to Earth from his work in [[Dimension Z (Arnim Zola)|Dimension Z]],{{r|Captain America Vol 7 22}} and after Zola's successful distraction sent off his S-Men on several missions.{{r|Captain America Vol 7 23}}

The Red Skull turned [[Genosha]] into a concentration camp, and abducted numerous mutants{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 23}} and [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]].{{r|Magneto Vol 3 9}} His activities were tracked down by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]{{r|Magneto Vol 3 9}} at the same time Scarlet Witch, Rogue, and [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] from the Avengers Unity Division were captured by the S-Men and brought to the island.

[[File:Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616) from Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 25 001.jpg|thumb|right|Red Onslaught]]
After escaping captivity, the Avengers encountered and rescued Magneto.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 24}} The Red Skull and the S-Men confronted the escapees, but after using [[Mutant Growth Hormone]] to enhance his powers, Magneto managed to wipe out all members of the S-Men, before killing the Red Skull without the use of his mutant gifts, offering him a "pure" death. However, Erik had merely unleashed a more powerful persona of the Red Skull, [[Onslaught]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 25}}

===[[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|AXIS]]===
The [[Red Onslaught]] started telepathically spreading hate across the world, as Magneto and the Avengers Unity Division tried to stop him. The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] came to help after locating the Skull following the discovery he was the source of the "World War Hate," who were shortly after joined by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and other allies. However, the Red Onslaught deployed two [[Adamantium]] [[Stark Sentinel]]s which had been created by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] under the influence of the Skull's telepathy, with their creation having been wiped from his memories by the villain.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 1}}

The Sentinels managed to turn the odds in favor of the Red Onslaught, as they managed to capture almost every hero in the scene. The cavalry arrived in the form of [[Astonishing Avengers (Earth-616)|a group of super villains]] Magneto had assembled after temporarily abandoning the fight, because the Stark Sentinels had been made to fight using the known weaknesses of heroes, not villains.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 2}}

The Scarlet Witch and [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] managed to cast a spell to invert the axis of Skull's brain, to make a fragment of Charles Xavier still present in it take control of the Skull's body and stop the Red Onslaught. The inversion spell was a success, and the Red Skull was knocked unconscious and reversed from his Red Onslaught form. Before he could wake up to reveal whether Charles Xavier was now in control or not, as the X-Men wanted, the Avengers decided to be cautious and take the Red Skull prisoner to the Stark Tower.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 3}}

The inverted Avengers planned on killing the Red Skull to prevent any opportunity of reinverting them from happening. After the seemingly disappearance of the Red Skull from Stark Tower, the inverted Avengers took prisoners every hero who was or had been an Avenger, as they were suspects of freeing the Skull.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 4}}

The Red Skull had actually been cloaked by [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Jarvis]], who didn't want the Avengers to become murderers. He was later freed by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]], who planned on using him to reinvert the heroes.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 8}} With the help of Doctor Doom and the Scarlet Witch, at the time possessed by the spirit of [[Daniel Drumm (Earth-616)|Daniel Drumm]], the Red Skull managed to reinvert almost all those who had previously been affected, turning himself back to evil as well. However, the Red Skull was taken prisoner by Doctor Doom and brought to [[Latveria]] for experimentation.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 9}}

===Pleasant Hill===
After being visited by a newly-conceived omnipotent being known as [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]], the Red Skull put a plan into motion to cause Steve Rogers' fall once and for all. Kobik had been accidentally created by S.H.I.E.L.D., it was a being composed of different fragments of [[Cosmic Cube]]s accumulated over the years. One of these fragments belonged to a Cube that had fallen under the original Red Skull's possession several years earlier. The memory of Skull's obsession for that Cube was misinterpreted by Kobik's childish mentality as affection, so she went to the Red Skull in search for love. The Red Skull took advantage of the child's affinity and naivety and taught her the ways of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]. Kobik began to lead a double life, using her omnipresence to be in the company of both S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Red Skull at the same time, while keeping the latter a secret.

When Kobik's innocently deranged set of values caused her to rewrite the past of her caretaker, [[Erik Selvig (Earth-616)|Erik Selvig]], and insert a life-long loyalty to Hydra in it, Red Skull was inspired to come up with a master plan for Rogers' end. Under the orders of the Red Skull, Selvig proposed to S.H.I.E.L.D. the creation of [[Pleasant Hill]], a picture-perfect town inhabited by reformed super-villains, whose appearance and memories were tampered with using Kobik's power.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 2}} As a consequence of the Red Skull's manipulations, one of the villains, the [[Paul Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|Fixer]], subconsciously created a device that returned him to his true self, and he then proceeded to use it on several other inmates, who, being led by [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]], unleashed a coordinated assault on the town to wreak havoc in revenge for having their lives tampered with.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hill Vol 1 1}}

Red Skull subsequently infiltrated the town under the telepathic disguise of a inhabitant named Father Patrick, and made his way to the town hall, which had been turned into a lock-up to hold numerous S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel and citizens hostage, including S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] and Steve Rogers. Using his telepathy, the Skull implanted in Zemo the idea to let Father Patrick escort Steve Rogers and Maria Hill to get medical help for the latter.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 2}} When Rogers got to Erik Selvig for help, Selvig directed him to a bowling alley in order to find Kobik to restore peace. As part of the Skull's plan, when Rogers tried to reach out to Kobik, he was brutally attacked by [[Brock Rumlow (Earth-616)|Crossbones]]. With Rogers on the brink of death, Kobik intervened, and restored him to his prime. With the objective to turn Rogers into the most perfect version of himself, Kobik created a new reality in which Rogers was indoctrinated into Hydra since youth, and replaced Steve with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|this twisted version of himself]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 2}}

[[File:Hydra (Earth-616) from Captain America Steve Rogers Vol 1 7 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
===A New Hydra===
With his objective achieved and Zemo's uprising eventually being contained by the Avengers, the Red Skull fled from Pleasant Hill. In the aftermath of the incident, the Red Skull, Sin and Crossbones formed a new [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] out of Neo-Nazi groups. The Skull intended to take the organization back from its modern incarnation to its Nazism days and control the world not by a scheme to take over it, but by changing it to his image to the point where it would accept him as his leader.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Omega Vol 1 1}}

===Showdown with the Avengers Unity Squad===
The Red Skull eventually made his move against the Avengers Unity Squad, activating a psychic trigger he had implanted on [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]]'s mind to take control over it and force him to capture his teammates.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 18}} After successfully taking control over the minds of the captured Avengers (with the exception of [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], who erased his own consciousness),{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 19}} the Red Skull sent them after [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], who managed to escape from Quicksilver. However, with the help of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[Wong (Earth-616)|Wong]], Deadpool invaded the [[Avengers Mansion]] and broke [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] free of the Red Skull's control by making her wear an old [[Magneto's Helmet|Magneto helmet]], which prompted her to capture the villain.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 20|21}}

[[File:Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616) from Captain America Steve Rogers Vol 1 15 0001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Death]]
He was later submitted to a brain surgery conducted by [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] to remove the portions of Charles Xavier's brain from his own, and put into [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody soon afterwards.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 22}}

===Death===
After escaping from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, a weakened Red Skull went to his private estate to rest, but was instead attacked by Steve Rogers, who had been planning to overthrow Shmidt since Kobik's tampering brought him to this world. The Skull was beaten to a pulp before being hurled through a window by Rogers, sending him to his death.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 15}} The Skull's head was later presented to Magneto by Rogers as a peace offering to convince Magneto to agree to the creation of the mutant nation of [[New Tian]] so Rogers didn't have to fight the mutants when he took over the United States.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #17}}
