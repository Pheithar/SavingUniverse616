| HistoryText             = The [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]]' existence was exposed to the general public when [[Aaron English (Earth-616)|Dollar Bill]]'s documentary aired on television. [[Sagittarius (LMD) (Earth-616)|Sagittarius]] and [[Libra (LMD) (Earth-616)|Libra]] formed a band of criminals to commit crimes, claiming to be the Defenders in order to ruin the group's good name. 

The villainous group split into two teams: Sagittarius leading [[Alexander Gentry (Earth-616)|Porcupine]], [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]], [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|Beetle]], [[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Whirlwind]], [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc]], [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]], [[Norton Fester (Earth-616)|Looter]], and [[Samuel Smithers (Earth-616)|Plantman]]; Libra commanding [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]], [[Joe the Gorilla (Earth-616)|Joe the Gorilla]], [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]], [[Bruno Horgan (Earth-616)|Melter]], [[Vincent Patilio (Earth-616)|Leap-Frog]], [[Herman Schultz (Earth-616)|Shocker]], and [[Pecos (Earth-616)|Pecos]].

Both squads run afoul of the real Defenders, whose ranks were bolstered by new [[Defenders for a Day (Earth-616)|"try out" members]], bandwagoning off the film's popularity. A group led by [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] battled Sagittarius' team until [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]] knocked them out with a mental burst. Libra's group was also single-handedly bested by a furiously berserk and hallucinating [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]].

Following the battle, Sagittarius's group was taken into police custody, while Libra's team presumably escaped. They disbanded after their defeat, never reforming even though many members have worked together since.
