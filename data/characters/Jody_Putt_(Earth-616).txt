| History                 = The new [[Jester]], Jody Putt had his technology and weaponry provided by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] himself. Doctor Doom gave Jester the powerful [[Hulk Robot (Earth-616)|Hulk Robot]] as one his main weapons to battle his enemies. Jester recruited a team of criminals known as the [[Assembly of Evil (Earth-616)|Assembly of Evil]] with the help of the Hulk Robot, [[Morris Bench (Earth-616)|Hydro-Man]], [[Fenris (Earth-616)|Fenris]], and [[Samuel John LaRoquette (Earth-616)|Rock]]. The group was defeated by [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] and [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] along with some members of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Mutant Misadventures of Cloak and Dagger Vol 1 #8|9}}

This Jester later was forced to join the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts Army]] during the [[Civil War]]. The team was created to hunt supervillains and unregistered heroes. The team was kept under control thanks to nanobots injected into their bodies. If they disobeyed an order they would be electrocuted.{{r|Civil War #4}}

The Jester was sent with fellow teammate [[Steven Levins (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern]] to hunt down the now rogue [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]. The pair tracked the hero through New York's sewers; they gravely injured Spider-Man, and rather than take him in they decided to kill him. Thankfully for Spider-Man the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] intervened and shot both Jack O'Lantern and Jester dead. [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mr Hyde]] used the deceased villain's corpse to find a way around the nanotechnology preventing his escape.{{r|Civil War #5}}
