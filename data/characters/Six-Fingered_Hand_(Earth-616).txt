| HistoryText             = The '''Six-Fingered Hand''' was a group of six [[lesser demons]], [[Avarrish (Earth-616)|Avarrish]], [[Fashima (Earth-616)|Fashima]], [[Hyppokri (Earth-616)|Hyppokri]], [[Puishannt (Earth-616)|Puishannt]], [[Unnthinnk (Earth-616)|Unnthinnk]] and [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|"Maya"]], acting as pawns of more powerful demons, including [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]], who posed as Maya.<!-- {{r|Defenders #94|99}} -->

The legion of demons once plotted to merge [[Earth]] and [[Hell]], but their plan was successfully opposed by the Defenders. The six are also responsible for the creation of the [[Lesser Grey God]], a statuette which has the power to reactivate old curses.{{r|Defenders #94|99}}

The lesser demons seemingly reformed themselves into the '''Five-Fingered Hand''', which was considered as a group "in charge" in Hell, quoted along the [[Lords of the Splinter Realms (Earth-616)|Lords of the Splinter Realms]] and the [[Cabal (Hell) (Earth-616)|Cabal]].{{r|Captain Britain and MI-13 Annual #1}}
