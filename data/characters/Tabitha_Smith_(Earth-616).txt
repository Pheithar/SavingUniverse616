===Origins===
Teenager '''Tabitha Smith''' had not gotten along with her parents for most of her life.{{r|Secret Wars II #5}} Her powers emerged when she turned thirteen and entered puberty. Aroused by [[Bret McAllister (Earth-616)|Bret McAllister]], she accidentally blew the roof of her school's lunch room.{{r|Astonishing Tales: Boom Boom and Elsa Vol 1 1}}

Her parents were appalled. Resentful towards her father, [[Marty Smith (Earth-616)|Marty Smith]], Tabitha put a small explosive ball of energy in his food. In retaliation, her father beat Tabitha severely. Somehow, learning there was a school for mutants in [[New York (State)|New York]]'s [[Westchester County]] -- which was, in fact, [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Xavier's]] [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|School for Gifted Youngsters]], headquarters for the hero teams [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] -- Tabitha ran away from home, journeying there by train and giving herself the code name Time Bomb.{{r|Secret Wars II #5}}

Near [[Washington, D.C.]], a train was wrecked, on a whim, by the [[Abstract Entities|cosmic entity]] calling itself the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]]. Thinking he was a mutant, Tabitha accompanied The Beyonder. The Beyonder abandoned her, but returned and took her to Professor Xavier's school. The X-Men and New Mutants attacked the Beyonder, who escaped, and Tabitha, frightened and bewildered by witnessing the attack, left. She was later found by the Beyonder, who brought her to a distant planet that he called [[World Complex Headquarters|"World Complex Headquarters"]] of the [[glossary:A#Alien|alien]] [[Celestials (Earth-616)|Celestials]]. There, threatening to destroy the universe, the Beyonder fought and seemingly defeated a number of Celestials. However, that planet was not truly the Celestials' headquarters and the Celestials allowed the Beyonder to "defeat" them, presumably in order to observe him in action.{{r|Secret Wars II #5}}

Terrified, Tabitha demanded that the Beyonder transport her back to [[Earth]] and leave her alone; the Beyonder complied. Back on Earth, Tabitha alerted the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] about the Beyonder. Summoning him, Tabitha led him into an ambush by the Avengers and other costumed champions, before fleeing the scene. The Beyonder, who had regarded Tabitha as his only friend, allowed the Avengers to defeat him.{{r|Secret Wars II #5}}

===X-Factor Trainee===
Making her way to [[Los Angeles]], Tabitha, calling herself Boom-Boom, encountered the mutant criminal known as the [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]], who made her a member of his gang of thieves, the [[Fallen Angels (Earth-616)|Fallen Angels]], and taught her how to steal. Believing that the Vanisher treated her badly, Tabitha alerted [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] to his presence, as she believed the group to be mutant hunters. When two members of X-Factor arrived, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] and [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], Tabitha changed her mind about turning in the Vanisher and used her "time bomb" power on the Iceman, who she flirted with as a prank. The two heroes pursued and caught up to her in their costumed identities. Tabitha agreed to leave the Vanisher's gang and live at the [[X-Factor Complex]] instead.{{r|X-Factor #11|12}}

Upon learning that [[Emma la Porte (Earth-616)|Emma la Porte]] was being transferred to a [[New York City|New York]] hospital, to undergo further treatment for the severe burning he was responsible for, [[Russell Collins (Earth-616)|Rusty Collins]], a fellow X-Factor trainee, cut a deal with [[Masque (Earth-616)|Masque]], a dangerous member of the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]], where he would sacrifice his looks to Masque's whims, if Masque restored Emma's face to beauty. Boom-Boom, [[Sally Blevins (Earth-616)|Skids]], and [[Arthur Maddicks (Earth-616)|Artie Maddicks]] accompanied Rusty to the hospital, where Boom-Boom destroyed a wall to escape, and they brought Emma to [[Alley|The Alley]]. Masque held his end, but when Emma learned of the deal, she insisted her looks not come at such an expense. Rusty and Skids fought Masque and he undid his morphing of both Rusty and Emma, before retreating back into the sewer tunnels.{{r|X-Factor #16}}

===Fallen Angels===
After Beast wouldn't believe her about [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] talking to himself, Tabitha had set off another of her "time bombs" in the X-Factor laboratory as a prank and Beast and Iceman pursued her through the headquarters. Another member of the Fallen Angels, [[Ariel (Coconut Grove) (Earth-616)|Ariel]], used her powers to enable Tabitha to escape X-Factor headquarters through a broom closet.{{r|Fallen Angels #3}}{{r|X-Factor #17}} After meeting [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] and [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]], the group was joined by [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] and [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Jamie Madrox]], who Tabitha also developed a crush on. The group teleported to the Valley of the Flame, on [[Earth-78411|Dinosaur World]], where they were joined by [[Moon-Boy (Earth-78411)|Moon Boy]] and [[Devil Dinosaur (Earth-78411)|Devil Dinosaur]]. Tabitha was teamed with [[Alphonsus Lefszycic (Earth-616)|Gomi]] the majority of the time, a fact she resented. After all of the mutant's powers, temporarily, went out-of-whack due to [[Chance (Fallen Angels) (Earth-616)|Chance]], Ariel suggested that they all leave and teleported them to the [[Coconut Grove]], her home planet. The inhabitants of the Coconut Grove and the leader, [[Unipar (Earth-616)|Unipar]], captured the Fallen Angels, intending to use them as experiments to continue their evolution, but the Angels worked together to defeat them and return home.{{r|Fallen Angels #4|8}}

Boom-Boom returned just in time to witness [[Right (Earth-616)|The Right]] soldiers kidnapping the children of X-Factor. Tabitha stowed away on their transport and followed them to their hide-away, where she rescued new recruit, [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] and recognized The Right's Commander as X-Factor's PR man, [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]]. Tabitha and Rictor were immediately recaptured, however, until X-Factor arrived and rescued them.{{r|X-Factor #21|23}}

===Living on Ship===
After their defeat of [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]], his [[Prosh (Earth-616)|ship]] crash landed on their Complex. X-Factor began living on Apocalypse's sentient Ship, that had a barrier only mutants could enter, and [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]] left with Apocalypse. After the children were given Christmas gifts as donations, they decided to give them to the children who lost their homes during X-Factor's battle, a situation Boom-Boom had trouble dealing with.{{r|X-Factor #25|26}} While sleeping, X-Factor and the kids were attacked by Ship, still under the control of Apocalypse, until Rusty freed its consciousness and X-Factor expelled a bomb. Ship, now able to speak, asked to join them. Ship had complete control over every part of its structure and could fashion rooms, weapons, and vehicles as needed from various storehouses and parts it had. It was also able to design and run training programs for X-Factor, as well as make living quarters and workshop areas for them.{{r|X-Factor #28|30}} While playing around on Ship, the students ran into Beast, who was going over old photos of X-Factor in their teens and revealed their origins, as the original X-Men and students at the School for Gifted Youngsters.{{r|X-Factor Annual #3}} After Iceman was tricked and seduced by [[Infectia (Josephine) (Earth-616)|Infectia]] to allow her on Ship, Beast attempted to warn Iceman. Due to Beast's lack of intelligence, Iceman couldn't understand him and the students had to keep her from kissing Iceman.{{r|X-Factor #30|31}} When the [[Xartan Deviants|Xartans]] and [[Zano (Xartan) (Earth-616)|Lord Zano]], in Avengers disguise, attacked X-Factor, the children were protected by Ship, but later aided X-Factor.{{r|X-Factor #32}} After finding out that they were going to be sent to a private school, [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]] and Iceman took the kids shopping for clothes, where they were attacked by the [[Alliance of Evil (Earth-616)|Alliance of Evil]]. After defeating the Alliance of Evil, [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]] showed-up and ordered Rusty and X-Factor to register, to which X-Factor accepted. Rusty however turned himself into the Navy and refused to register.{{r|X-Factor #33}}

===X-Terminators===
After seeing Rusty off at a Naval base, Tabitha, Skids, and Rictor were enrolled in Phillips Academy in Exeter, [[New Hampshire (State)|New Hampshire]]. After a cold reception from the other students of the academy, the students were awoken in their dorms by [[Takeshi Matsuya (Earth-616)|Takeshi Matsuya (Wiz Kid)]], informing them that Artie and Leech had been kidnapped by demons. After leaving the dorms, the students rescued Rusty from his prison and began the search for Artie and Leech.{{r|X-Terminators #1}} After stopping to get new outfits, Rictor suggested the name [[X-Terminators (Earth-616)|X-Terminators]] for the group, to honor X-Factor, and the group was attacked by demons, kidnapping [[Takeshi Matsuya (Earth-616)|Taki]]. Following a mental image from Artie, the X-Terminators battled an invasion of demons.{{r|X-Terminators #2}} After being captured by the demons, the X-Terminators were teleported to [[Times Square]], where the New Mutant [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] was opening a portal to return her teammates from the demon infested dimension of [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]]. The demon [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]] kept the portal open using [[Inferno Babies (Earth-616)|ten kidnapped mutant infants]], one of them being [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Nathan Summers]], as the points of an inverted pentagram. The infants provided strong focusing beams of power because of their purity and openness to use them as natural, living conduits who could not block the flow of power, and who would not know how to shut it off.{{r|{{cl|X-Terminators Vol 1 3}}-[[X-Terminators Vol 1 4|4]]}}{{r|New Mutants #72}}

Artie and Leech freed the X-Terminators and they battled the horde of demons that flowed out of the portal. After [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]] rescued Rusty and Skids, the team joined the New Mutants in rescuing the infants being used to keep the portal open, where Tabitha was reunited with Sunspot and Warlock. Rusty suggested that the X-Terminators rescue their teammate, Taki, while the New Mutants continued to free the infants and disrupt the pentagram. After rescuing Taki, Tabitha joined the New Mutants as they began searching for the demonic Magik.{{r|X-Terminators #4}}{{r|New Mutants #73}}

While searching for the [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Darkchilde]] through-out the city, Tabitha and the New Mutants witnessed [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], the New Mutants new headmaster, and the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)#Inner Circle Lineups|Inner Circle]] of the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] meeting with N'astirh and lost all trust in him. The New Mutants, Boom-Boom, and Rictor found Darkchilde battling the demon, [[S'ym (Earth-616)|S'ym]], at the same time her brother, the X-Man [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], appeared. Colossus was shocked to see his Little Snowflake in such a state and Darkchilde was embarrassed and teleported away, taking the young heroes with her to Limbo, where she finally decided to stop running from her responsibilities as the ruler of Limbo.{{r|New Mutants #73}}

===New Mutants===
After Limbo, the X-Terminators and New Mutants returned to X-Factor's Ship, with the mutant babies and [[Gosamyr (Earth-616)|Gosamyr]].{{r|New Mutants #74}} Due to her actions during the demonic invasion, Tabitha was expelled from Phillips Academy and, while the New Mutants returned home and X-Factor attended funerals, the X-Terminators found an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] horn and accidentally called forth a giant sea creature. The New Mutants returned and, with the aid of [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor the Submariner]], they defeated it. After the creature's defeat, X-Factor returned and the New Mutants began to live on Ship, merging with the X-Terminators as Professor X's [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|mansion]] had been destroyed.{{r|New Mutants #76}} Boom Boom developed a crush on one of the new members, [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Sam Guthrie (Cannonball)]]. The all-new New Mutants team returned Illyana to her home in Ust-Ordynski Collective, [[Siberia]], with her parents. On their return home, [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Mirage]] and [[Brightwind (Earth-616)|Brightwind]], her winged horse, became ill with a mystical fever. Unaware of how to save Mirage, Ship suggested that the New Mutants go to [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]] to help her. After arriving at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], the New Mutants were startled to learn that Dr. Strange was apparently "dead" and they were attacked by a possessed, inflamed Mirage and Brightwind. Mirage reasserted control and Dr. Strange, disguised as "Dr. Sanders", returned all that her body had damaged to normal.{{r|New Mutants #77}} While returning Mirage and Brightwind to Ship, the New Mutants were attacked by [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]] (government-chartered mutant enforcers composed of former members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]), believing Rusty caused all of the flames. The battle between the New Mutants and Freedom Force awoke Mirage and Brightwind and Ship suddenly warped-off into space with X-Factor. After Rusty and Skids learned that the government never returned the infants to their parents, Dr. Strange teleported the remaining New Mutants to [[Asgard (Realm)|Asgard]].{{r|New Mutants #78}}

After arriving in Asgard, the New Mutants realized that they had been sent to the [[Negative Zone]] and [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Dani Moonstar]] left them. After being captured, by [[Dwarves]], the New Mutants were released and joined them, due to Cannonball's relationship with [[Eitri (Earth-616)|Eitri]], king of the Dwarves.{{r|New Mutants #79|80}} As a member of the New Mutants, Tabitha followed the group under the leadership of Cannonball and, later, [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]]. She also remained with the group as Cable transformed it into [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]].{{r|New Mutants #91|92}} During this time, she became enamored with Cannonball and the two developed a romantic relationship.{{r|New Mutants #94}}

===X-Force===
During her time with X-Force, Tabitha underwent a series of progressive changes in attitude, growing more and more serious in her role as a costumed hero. For a short time at the beginning of her tenure, she called herself Boomer.{{r|New Mutants #100}} Later, she changed her code name to '''Meltdown''' to better match her more drastic changes in looks and attitude.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 52}} Eventually, Tabitha was forced to confront her past and deal with the broken relationships of her family.{{Citation}}

When Cannonball was asked to leave X-Force and join the X-Men, Tabitha reluctantly let him go, knowing their relationship would end. She continued to adventure alongside X-Force, and briefly became enamored of her teammate [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]];{{r|X-Force Vol 1 76}} however, when Cannonball returned to the team months later, the two resumed their relationship.{{r|X-Force #84}}

X-Force later agreed to be led by the British ex-government agent [[Peter Wisdom (Earth-616)|Pete Wisdom]], who once again turned the team into an underground paramilitary force, at one point faking their own deaths in order to operate more clandestinely. After one adventure, X-Force survived being in the center of a Vibranium bomb explosion. The team decided to let the world believe them dead and to use this status to secretly infiltrate and destroy anti-mutant organizations around the world. After half a year of this hit-and-run strategy, they learned of a great underground complex where Wisdom's sister, [[Romany Wisdom (Earth-616)|Romany]], was infecting people with alien DNA to alter the human race. In the final battle, X-Force destroyed the alien complex and were believed dead.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 102|115}}

Tabitha and X-Force reappeared at a press conference for a new team calling itself X-Force, challenging the team (now [[X-Statix (Earth-616)|X-Statix]]) in dispute for their name. During the battle, Tabitha was teleported by X-Statix' [[Edith Sawyer (Earth-616)|U-Go Girl]] and left high in the air above a busy freeway. As for X-Force, the heroes were ultimately forced to retreat and presumably disbanded shortly afterward.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 117}}

===Underground===
When Cable discovered hints to the existence of a revamped [[Weapon X (Team) (Earth-616)|Weapon X]] program, one designed to use mutants to hunt down and intern other mutants, Cable created an organization to investigate the program and the existence of its internment camp, Neverland. He dubbed the organization the [[Underground (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Underground]], and invited Meltdown to join his elite group. Ultimately, Cable's Underground group was joined by Weapon X agent [[Brent Jackson (Earth-616)|Brent Jackson]], who hoped to stage a coup against the [[Malcolm Colcord (Earth-616)|Director]] and had formed his own resistance group with fellow agents [[Washout]], [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]], [[Kyle Gibney (Earth-616)|Wild Child]], and [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]].{{r|{{cl|Weapon X Vol 2 6}}-[[Weapon X Vol 2 10|10]]}}

With Washout's help and sacrifice, the Underground was able to infiltrate the Weapon X complex, ousting the Director, and nearly crippling the program. However, before the final defeat, Agent Jackson betrayed the Underground, turning Cable's psychic powers against his allies. Jackson captured the Underground members and altered their memories to erase everything they saw and learned about the program. Even so, Cable and the Underground escaped, aided by Weapon X's Marrow, and believed the program to be nothing more than a military cover story.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 11|13}}

===Nextwave===
[[File:Tabitha Smith (Earth-616) from Nextwave Vol 1 2 0001.jpg|thumb|Tabitha Smith in Nextwave]]
Shortly afterwards, Tabitha grew her hair long and eschewed her codename, reappearing as a founding member of [[Nextwave (Earth-63163)|Nextwave]]. The [[Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort (Earth-63163)|Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort]], or H.A.T.E. (a subsidiary of the [[Beyond Corporation (Multiverse)|Beyond Corporation]]) formed the team. Tabitha Smith's new team included [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Monica Rambeau]] (formerly Captain Marvel, the leader of the Avengers), [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]], [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Aaron Stack]], and [[The Captain]].{{r|Nextwave #1}}

Tabitha stole the marketing plan for aircraft from H.A.T.E after discovering through theft that a former terrorist cell called S.I.L.E.N.T. morphed into the Beyond Corporation. They found the corporation’s marketing plan, which involved using H.A.T.E. and their own resources to product-test unusual WMDs on the American public. The biological weapon was revealed to be [[Fin Fang Foom (Earth-616)|Fin Fang Foom]], a giant lizard which clambered from underground and proceeded to wreck the building site.{{r|Nextwave #2}}

After putting an end to the threat of Fin Fang Foom in [[Abcess]], [[North Dakota (State)|North Dakota]], Nextwave moved on to [[Illinois (State)|Illinois]]. Tabitha managed to subdue [[Mac Mangel (Earth-63163)|Mac Mangel]], a corrupt police officer who had been taken as a host by the [[Ultra Samurai Seed]], with a time bomb. The Ultra Samurai metallic shell disintegrated, leaving Mangel crushed on the ground. Upon learning that he was a police officer, Tabitha and Aaron began to beat Mangel before Rambeau intervened.{{r|{{cl|Nextwave Vol 1 3}}-[[Nextwave Vol 1 4|4]]}}

The team were later attacked by 'The [[New Paramounts (Earth-63163)|New Paramounts]]', a team consisting of [[Irving Forbush (Earth-63163)|Forbush Man]], The Inedible [[David Beiderbecke (Earth-63163)|Bulk]], and [[Charlie America (Earth-63163)|Charlie America]]. Forbush Man attempted to use his mind control powers on Tabitha, but was shocked to find they didn't work on her as she apparently had no mind. Tabitha subsequently killed Forbush Man, saving her teammates.{{r|{{cl|Nextwave Vol 1 8}}-[[Nextwave Vol 1 10|10]]}}

===Manifest Destiny===
Tabitha relocated with the rest of the X-Men to [[San Francisco]], and resumed using the codename Boom-Boom. On a shopping spree, she encountered [[Nuwa (Earth-616)|Nuwa]] wreaking havoc on the local shopping scene. After researching Nuwa's weakness, Tabitha defeated her new enemy.{{r|X-Men: Manifest Destiny #1}}

===Leper Queen===
Tabitha was later abducted by anti-mutant extremists, the [[Sapien League (Earth-616)|Sapien League]], alongside [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]] and [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]]. Tabitha was held hostage by their leader, the [[Leper Queen (Earth-616)|Leper Queen]], when the mutant strike force [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] invaded her headquarters looking for the lost mutants. When X-Force were forcibly transported into the future by [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], the Leper Queen, angry at not being killed by the team, shot Tabitha in the head.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 13}} Arriving just prior to the shot, [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] managed to prevent Tabitha's death by shooting the Leper Queen.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 17}}

===Cable and X-Force===
Boom-Boom later aided her old X-Force teammate [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] in her infiltration and destruction of a [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] base.{{r|Cable and X-Force Vol 1 6}}

===Utopians===
Some time following the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|conflict between the Avengers against the X-Men]], after which [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] was abandoned, Boom-Boom formed part of the [[Utopians (Earth-616)|Utopians]], a group of mutants that started inhabiting the ruins of the island.{{r|All-New X-Men #40}}

The [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] were reached out to by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to investigate the island after a recon team went missing. The X-Men teleported to the island and initially engaged the Utopians. After talking it out and discovering the Utopians wanted nothing but to be safe and undisturbed, the X-Men offered them a place at the [[Weapon X Facility|New Charles Xavier School]], which they gladly accepted.{{r|All-New X-Men #41}}

===Krakoa===
Tabitha helped save several mutants in [[Nebraska (State)|Nebraska]] after an outreach mission went wrong.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 4}} Along with several New Mutants members, she traveled to [[Carnelia]] in order to help a [[Natashia Repina (Earth-616)|young mutant]] who had just developed her powers.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 9}}

| Powers                  = '''Time Bombs''': Tabitha can create balls of plasma, which she calls her "time bombs." These "bombs" explode with concussive force. She can produce marble-sized "bombs" which have little concussive impact and which she uses for playing pranks. She has produced "time bombs" ranging up to the size of beach balls, which, when they explode, can smash tree trunks and even metal objects. The amount of concussive impact depends on the size of the bomb she creates, and she can, at least to some extent, control the amount of time until it detonates. After training with X-Factor and adventuring with X-Force, she has learned increasingly greater control over the energy she generates. She can now muffle the sound of the detonation to a limited extent and generate explosive energy as streams that respond to her thought directions. Now possessing greater control over her powers, she can even reabsorb the energy of undetonated bombs and is no longer afraid to use her time bombs in nearly lethal ways.{{Citation}}
