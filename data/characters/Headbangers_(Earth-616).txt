The Headbangers were a collection of members of [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] who were controlled by [[Arthur Goddard (Earth-616)|Headlok]]. He used them as pawns against the remaining members of Alpha Flight and the Fantastic Four. He lost control when [[Jeanne-Marie Beaubier (Earth-616)|Aurora]] used her own light powers on herself and freed her own mind and the other members eventually were freed as well.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 93|94}}
