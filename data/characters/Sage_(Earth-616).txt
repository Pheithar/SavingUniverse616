As a young teenager, Sage hadn't escaped war. She found herself caught up in the Russian invasion of [[Afghanistan]]. She had been forced to learn to fight to survive encounters with both soldiers and local bandits, and took weapons and equipment from the bodies of fallen combatants wherever she found them. One day, Sage felt herself compelled to enter a cave in the nearby [[Hindu Kush]] mountain range. There, she found the powerful telepathic mutant [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]], his legs crushed by a [[Lucifer (Quist) (Earth-616)|"demon"]]. Initially wary of him, Sage rescued the critically injured [[homo superior|mutant]] but soon after they encountered a [[Shaw Industries (Earth-616)|Shaw Industries]]/[[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] aid convoy being attacked by bandits.<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU to here --> Using her rifle, she picked-off the attackers from her hill-side vantage point. Down at the site of the attack, she briefly stood, horrified, over the raped body of a young female aid worker. Then, sensing she was about to be attacked from behind, she spun and shot one of the bandits.<!-- He was wearing a hastily donned U.N. jacket, probably as a disguise to kill young Sage.--> Unswayed as he plead for his life, she unsheathed her knife and killed him.<!-- I don't think we can be sure the man she killed was the rapist, despite what the official handbook says, see talk page. -->{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 44|, The Soviet-Afghan war should be considered a [[Glossary:Topical Reference|topical reference]], as Sage's backstory was revealed in 2004 to be "perhaps twenty years ago".}}

===Hellfire Club===
Xavier would, in return, save Sage, sending for her when he returned to [[United States of America|America]]. He had begun forming the first iteration of his team of teenage mutants, the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. Xavier kept the presence of the warrior girl a secret, instead training her to capitalize upon her talents as his personal spy. Sage's mission was to infiltrate the social organization for the rich and powerful known as the [[Hellfire Club]] and to gain the trust of [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]], then Black Bishop of the New York branch of the Hellfire Club.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 7}}<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU -->

Sebastian gave her the name "Tessa", and she acted as his familiar, advising and counseling him in both his legitimate and illegal business practices, all the while gathering information for Xavier.

Sebastian Shaw had gathered mutants around himself, including Tessa, [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], [[Harold Leland (Earth-616)|Harry Leland]], and his fiancee [[Lourdes Chantel (Earth-616)|Lourdes Chantel]]. Initially he believed that [[Edward Buckman (Earth-616)|White King]]'s support of the [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] program would lead to the commercialization of mutant powers, but on one Christmas evening, Lourdes and Tessa advised him to regard the White King as an enemy. Minutes later, a Sentinel attacked Sebastian's beach house. Not dissuaded by Tessa's warning, Lourdes died to protect Sebastian. In response, Emma and Sebastian killed the entire leadership of the Hellfire Club as Tessa watched.{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 7}}

Under new management, the Hellfire Club would soon come into direct conflict with the X-Men when the mutant illusionist [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Jason Wyngarde]] brought [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] under his influence and presented her as a potential Black Queen as a gift to assure his own bid for membership. While Tessa was in no position to defend one of Xavier's students, she would still regret her inaction.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 132}}{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 3}}

The rise of Sebastian Shaw caused English secret-agent, [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Elizabeth Braddock]] to be assigned to infiltrate the Hellfire Club. Tessa, seeing her as brave and innocent as Jean Grey, confronted her, reflected her psychic attack, and quickly convinced her to abandon her mission.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 3}}<!-- There's no evidence one way or the other that this occurred before Marvel Graphic Novel Vol 1 4 or after, but the description flows better if this paragraph is here. -->

During an arms deal between the Hellfire Club and [[Peter Coelho (Earth-616)|Peter Coelho]], Tessa spots [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] spying on the deal from above, which is enough to startle her into revealing herself. Danvers is defeated by Pierce and Leland, and forced to flee. The next day, Danvers boards a flight to Hong Kong to seduce Coelho for information, unaware that Tessa is two rows behind, watching her every move. It was soon revealed Tessa was following Coelho, and after discovering he was being reselling the armaments to [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], he died at the hands of Shaw.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes Vol 2 11}}

Soon, the renegade [[White Bishop]], [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]], attempted a coup of the Club's leadership. Pierce kidnapped Tessa, believing that without her Sebastian's position as Black King could more easily be compromised. She was rescued by Xavier and his team of [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] and, upon her return to the Club, Pierce was expelled.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel Vol 1 4}}<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU -->

A new contender for the title of [[Black Queen]], [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene Gallio]] demonstrated her mutant power over matter to Sebastian, to Tessa's shock. When Selene returned to Sebastian with her "gifts" of an entranced [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]] and [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Amara Aquilla]], Tessa instantly recognized Rachel as Jean's relation. Before she could advise Sebastian to take her gifts and use them to destroy Selene, Rachel and Amara broke free from Selene's control and were rescued by Xavier and the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 189}}

Despite this setback, Selene would go on to become the Black Queen, forcing Tessa to mediate between Selene's and Sebastian's egos. Selene would then bring the Inner Circle with her to hunt down Rachel, as the X-Men did the same. Their hunt was interrupted by [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]], resulting in Leland's death and Sebastian's crippling. Threatened with the arrival of the police revealing the Inner Circle publicly as mutants, Tessa offered a temporary sanctuary to the X-Men at the Hellfire Club.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 208|209}}

At Sebastian's invitation, [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] jointly joined the Hellfire Club as its [[White King]]. Magneto, headmaster of Xavier's school soon brought the youngest of the students to a gala hosted at the Hellfire Club. Seeing an opportunity, [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]] stole away from the gala and into the Club's depths and attempted to possess Tessa, succeeding only through surprise. Still wary, she commanded Tessa to use all of the access afforded by the Hellfire Club's systems to search for her missing siblings. Although she discovered nothing, she kept trying until Sebastian and Magneto caught her. Freed by the surprise and unaffected by the possession's normal after-effects, Tessa revealed that she had already been searching for Karma's siblings at Magneto's request. Devastated, Karma asked Tessa to deliver a farewell letter to [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Mirage]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 53|54}}

[[File:Sage (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe X-Men 2004 Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]
For a short time after Sebastian "died" at the hands of his [[Shinobi Shaw (Earth-616)|son]], Tessa served Shinobi Shaw. At [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]]'s first visit to the Manhattan branch of the Hellfire Club, Tessa psychically knocked out her and her date [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]], as they attempted to investigate Shinobi's activities, allowing Shinobi to offer Archangel the status of White King in private.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 67}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 29}}

When the new White King, [[Benedict Kine (Earth-616)|Benedict Kine]] challenged Shinobi to kill [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|John Jonah Jameson]] over an expose on the Hellfire Club, Tessa took it upon herself to telepathically needle [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Phoenix]], [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], Archangel, Psylocke and [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], forcing them to to interfere with the Kings' plot.{{r|Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 1}}

Tessa left the employ of Shinobi, rejoining Sebastian when he provided an exosuit to [[Nemesis (Earth-295)|Holocaust]]. In return, Shaw would have Holocaust help him capture a team of [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Men]], though Sebastian also relied on Tessa's mind-control to keep Holocaust in check. Tessa put [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]], [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]], [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boomer]], [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]], [[Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse)|Shatterstar]] and [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] under mind-control, and Shaw commanded them to kill [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]]. Ultimately, Cable overwhelmed X-Factor with his own immense but untrained telepathy, freeing them from her control.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 49|50}}

Their alliance with Holocaust came to an abrupt end when they were attacked and effortlessly defeated by [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], who had come to entreat Holocaust to capture [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]].{{r|X-Man Vol 1 15}}

Selene would gather together the [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|revived Goblin Queen]] and [[Trevor Fitzroy (Earth-1191)|teleporting time-traveller Trevor Fitzroy]], and take them to New York, where she would propose a new inner circle for the Hellfire Club to Sebastian to combat the threat of [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]]. When Madelyne lowered her hood, Tessa immediately recognised her, and prompted the dismissive Sebastian to reconsider. After Madelyne defeated Shaw's [[Red Rook]] for the title of [[Black Rook]], Tessa sought to unravel the mystery of Madelyne's revival by looking into her mind as she slept. Madelyne woke and defeated Tessa in a psychic duel, seemingly erasing her memory of the event. Tessa's intrusion had restored Madelyne's memories, giving her the impetus to start her own schemes. Tessa watched from the shadows as Madelyne used her wiles to secure for herself Shaw's backing at Selene's expense.{{r|X-Man Vol 1 21|23}}{{r|X-Man Annual Vol 1 1996}}{{r|X-Man Vol 1 24}}

<!-- Needs expansion from appearances in X-51 -->
Later, Tessa ran afoul of one of the Club’s regular and valued patrons, a reclusive billionaire named [[Elias Bogan (Earth-616)|Elias Bogan]]. Sebastian had made a wager with Bogan during a game of cards whereupon if Sebastian lost, Bogan would win the Club's the [[White Queen]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]. Bogan had never lost a game before, but with Tessa's help Sebastian won the bet.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 41}}<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU -->

Bogan honored the wager, but knew who was truly responsible for his defeat and exacted his revenge on Tessa, capturing her and branding her face. Rescued by Storm,{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 41}} Tessa soon affiliated herself with the X-Men, acting as part of their support crew. In order to shield herself from detection by Bogan, Tessa consciously shut down her telepathic abilities, relying solely on her computer-like mind to assist her new teammates.<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU -->

When [[Robert Kelly (Earth-616)|Senator Robert Kelly]] announced his intention to run for the Presidency on an anti-mutant platform, Tessa met with him to persuade him otherwise by convincing him that his actions were no different to those of the mutant terrorist [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 102}}<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU --> Kelly was not so easily swayed.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 103}}

===X-Men===
[[File:X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 21 Textless.jpg|thumb]]
She was given the code name "Sage" by Storm, and was recruited to Storm's newly-formed splinter group of the [[X-Men (X-Treme) (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. Their purpose was to search for the [[Destiny's Books|diaries]] of the blind mutant seer named [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny]] that predicted the future of mutantkind.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 109}}<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU --> On the new team's first mission, Sage was instrumental in saving the life of her teammate [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] after an encounter with the self-professed enhanced human named [[Vargas (Earth-616)|Vargas]]. Sage used a heretofore-unseen ability to advance the Beast's evolution to its next stage, healing him of his injuries and activating his latent [[Secondary Mutation]].{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 3}}<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU -->

Eventually learning of Sage's deception, Shaw allied himself with [[Regan Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Lady Mastermind]] to exact revenge on his former assistant. Lady Mastermind trapped Sage in a convincing illusion, making her believe that she was once again Shaw's assistant back in the Hellfire Club. Sage was freed thanks to the efforts of [[Heather Cameron (Earth-616)|Heather Cameron]], an Australian mutant with the ability to manifest various super-human powers depending on what the current situation called for, and the X-Men defeated Shaw once more.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 9}}<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU -->

In response to an invasion from a parallel universe taking place in [[Madripoor]], Sage catalyzed the latent mutant powers of Heather’s brother [[Davis Cameron (Earth-616)|Davis]], who subsequently joined the X-Treme X-Men as Slipstream.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 10}}<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU/partly rewritten --> In order to better combat the invaders, [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] soon demanded Sage's assistance in enhancing her mutant ability to grant her control over the manifestation of the powers and abilities she had absorbed over the years.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 13}}<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU --> Sage's infiltration of the invader's data network was instrumental in rescuing Storm from the invader's commander, [[Khan (Alien) (Earth-616)|Khan]].{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 16}}

During the initial invasion, [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]] nearly paralyzed Storm so she could attack captured prisoners. After the invasion was defeated, Sage humiliated Viper and threatened her life if she ever crossed them again.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 17}}

Later, the X-Treme team encountered [[Elias Bogan (Earth-616)|Elias Bogan]] once more.<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU --> After a murder at his Alaskan estate, Sage and [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] took it upon themselves to investigate.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 20}}<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU/partly rewritten --> A young mutant named [[Jeffrey Garrett (Earth-616)|Jeffrey Garrett]] was wanted for questioning after Bogan had his family killed and, in retaliation, he teleported Bogan's associates onto the nearby glacier where they froze to death. Garrett fled to the Xavier Institute where he came under the protection of Frost. However, Bogan had secretly possessed the young boy and when Frost scanned his mind, Bogan took possession of her.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 21}} Sage and Bishop followed the trail to the mansion where Bogan captured them, but the timely arrival of Storm allowed them to escape and defeat the villain.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 23}}<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU -->

Though Sage and Bishop had departed the Institute on poor terms, they still returned to investigate the murder of Emma Frost.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 140}}

Bogan soon returned to plague the X-Treme X-Men when he captured and mentally enslaved Bishop, hoping to use him as a weapon against his teammates.<!-- Plagiarism: OHMU --> Sage and Bishop had actually planned Bishop's capture, and the assault Sage planned on Bogan's [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] residence culminated with the rescue of Bogan's enslaved telepath, [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]]. Before departing L.A., Sage restored [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]]'s mutant ability.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 44}}

Sage then accompanied her teammates back to New York to assist in the rebuilding of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|mansion]] following an attack by Magneto, after which they rejoined the core X-Men team. Sage remained with Storm's team, which were now called the [[X-Treme Sanctions Executive (Earth-616)|X.S.E]], who operated as an international government-approved team with full authority on mutant situations around the globe. Sage operated a computer system that monitored the team's activities and analyzed relevant data.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 444}}

That Christmas, Sage used an [[Image Inducer|image inducer]] to trick Gambit into kissing her, once again using his emotions as a catalyst to jump-start his mutant regenerative ability, curing his blindness.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 165}}
[[File:Sage (Tessa) (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 454 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
When the X-Men were attacked by [[Fury (Earth-616)|The Fury]], it infected Sage with nanites by remotely transmuting her cybernetic sunglasses. Taken over by the Fury, Sage proved a formidable threat to her fellow X-Men until they were able to damage the connection established through the glasses, allowing Sage to free herself from the mind control.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 446}} Sage formulated a plan to use the team's powers to help [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]] create a miniature black hole effect, which finally defeated the Fury.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 447}}

After the Fury's defeat, Viper captured the X.S.E. to exact revenge on the team, especially Sage, by trapping them in one of [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]]'s [[Murderworld|Murderworlds]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 448}} Viper appeared to kill Sage, but it was soon seen that [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] had used an image inducer to take Sage's place.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 449}}

Meanwhile, Sage learned that Sebastian Shaw was reforming the Hellfire Club with the help of Viper and [[Opul Lun Sat-Yr-Nin (Earth-794)|Courtney Ross]] as White Queen. She accepted Shaw's invitation to return,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 451}} causing her former teammates to pursue. When they finally found her and Shaw, they discovered that [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Roberto Da Costa]] was the new Black King of the Hellfire Club. Before X.S.E. could decide on a position to take in these events, Shaw, Storm, Sage, and Roberto were captured by Donald Pierce.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 453}}

After Pierce was defeated, Sage confirmed to Shaw that she knew the attack was likely. Her betrayal of Shaw left da Costa as Lord Imperial of the Hellfire Club. Sage left the X-Men to advise and guide Sunspot, believing she could ensure he was not corrupted by power, as Sebastian had been.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 454}}

Six months before [[M-Day]], the White Queen ("Courtney Ross") and Viper were in England discussing their plans to take control of the devastated island of [[Genosha]]. Despite Courtney's fiery insistence that she wasn't afraid of potential meddling from Sage, she still ordered Viper not to send any electronic communications, evading Sage's attention.{{r|Excalibur Vol 3 11}}

The day after [[M-Day]], Sage compiled all the information available to her. Expanding on [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]'s initial findings, Sage was the first to say that humanity's [[Homo superior|Mutant]] potential had been erased.{{r|Decimation: House of M - The Day After Vol 1 1}}

===New Excalibur===
[[File:Sage (Earth-616) from X-Men Unlimited Vol 2 1 001.jpg|thumb]]
Some time later, Sage had moved to England, abandoning her mentorship of Roberto.<!-- Sunspot wouldn't appear in comics for two years after House of M The Day After Vol 1 1--> Sage and Courtney soon arrived at the hospital where the X-Men had come under attack. By offering her assistance, Courtney seemed to be using her connection with Sage to improve her standing in the eyes of [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]].{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 2|3}}

Sage quickly took operational command of the pursuit of the perpetrators, [[Shadow-X (Earth-6141)|black-clad versions of the original X-Men]]. With the threat neutralized, [[Peter Wisdom (Earth-616)|Pete Wisdom]] offered asylum to all present. [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] was once again reformed, with Sage alongside [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]], then-reformed [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]], and former [[Exiles (Multiverse)|Exile]] [[Talia Wagner (Earth-2182)|Nocturne]].{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 3|5}}

She helped them on various missions such as battling the [[Amahl Farouk (Earth-616)|Shadow King]]{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 6}} and returning to ancient Camelot to prevent it from being prematurely destroyed.{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 12}} Sage also played a key role in Nocturne's recovery from a debilitating stroke.{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 17}}

In order to learn more about a new foe, [[Bran Bardic (Earth-70518)|Albion]], and thwart his attempt to conquer [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Sage created the new cover identity and persona of '''Diana Fox'''. This persona appeared to be fully devoted to Albion and his goals. Notwithstanding the concerns of [[Peter Wisdom (Earth-616)|Pete Wisdom]], her infiltration was a success and she quickly gained seniority among Albion's [[Shadow-Captains_(Earth-616)|Shadow Captains]] as "Britannia", in doing so making a rival of [[Kelsey Leigh (Earth-616)|Lionheart]]. Sage was given a special suit as a member of Albion's army, which gave her flight and super-human physical strength. After touching Albion's technology-disabling artefact, only her manufactured personality, Diana Fox, was conscious. Diana, fully committed to Albion, slew two of Excalibur's erstwhile allies in Shadow-X, [[Scott Summers (Earth-6141)|Dark Cyclops]] and [[Henry McCoy (Earth-6141)|Dark Beast]]. Finally, a violent confrontation with her teammates in Excalibur helped Sage's original personality reassert itself. Together with Excalibur, Shadow-X, and Lionheart, Sage defeated Albion and his Shadow Captains.{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 20|24}}

===New Exiles===
Immediately after the defeat of the Shadow Captains, a party was held in honor of Excalibur. While the team enjoyed the party, Sage felt guilt for her actions. The party was suddenly crashed by [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] and an alternate universe [[John Proudstar (Earth-1100)|Thunderbird]], members of the dimension-hopping [[Exiles (Multiverse)|Exiles]] team.{{r|X-Men: Die by the Sword Vol 1 1}} They were then attacked by [[Rouge-Mort]] and drawn into a battle to save the multiverse from [[Merlyn (Otherworld)|Merlyn]] and Sage's old foe The Fury. Joining forces with the rest of the Exiles, [[Roma (Otherworld)|Roma]], and the [[Captain Britain Corps (Multiverse)|Captain Britain Corps]], the team defeated Merlyn, but not before he managed to kill Roma. In her final moments, Roma managed to surprise transfer all of her knowledge about the multiverse into Sage's mind. Sage was overwhelmed and she feared for her sanity. Fearful of what would happen if someone on Earth ever gained the knowledge in her mind, Sage joined the Exiles.{{r|X-Men: Die by the Sword Vol 1 5}}

The knowledge imparted to her by Roma caused her to suffer from hallucinations, as well as a re-emergence of the Diana Fox persona, attempting to take control of her again.{{r|New Exiles Vol 1 1}} Sage fought these, staying in the [[Panoptichron]] rather than accompanying the other Exiles on missions. After she attempted to suppress the Diana Fox personality, and later fought and defeated it, the Diana Fox personality ultimately sacrificed itself to save Sage when she was almost killed by Merlyn. Sage then saved the multiverse by merging with the Crystal Palace, becoming one with the Exiles team's computer base.{{r|New Exiles Vol 1 18}}

While merged with the Crystal Palace, Sage ran holographic simulations to train Psylocke to be able to defeat [[Slaymaster (Earth-1720)|Slaymaster]].{{r|X-Men: Sword of the Braddocks Vol 1 1}}

Long term exposure to the Panoptichron was later shown to be extremely hazardous. Like Sage, the rest of the Exiles were absorbed into its crystal structure, and all entered a state of suspended animation.{{r|Exiles Vol 2 6}} Morph avoided this fate while Psylocke had previously been abducted by [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]]'s ghost.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 509}}

===Multiversal X-Men===

Sage revived from this state, without explanation. Referred to as "Ambassador Sage", she had assumed a leadership position in the [[S.W.O.R.D. (Earth-24135)|S.W.O.R.D.]] of an [[Earth-24135|alternate reality]] in which sentient robots, led by Prime Minister [[Danger (Earth-24135)|Danger]], had exterminated the human population. Sage observed her old teammate Dazzler and an alternate reality Wolverine called [[James Howlett (Earth-TRN208)|Howlett]] attempting to rescue [[Kurt Waggoner (Earth-24135)|Kurt Waggoner]] from the robots, and rescued them in a [[Sage's S.W.O.R.D. Ship|space-faring robot mech stolen from S.W.O.R.D]].{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 2 7}}

With her diplomatic role no longer viable, Sage joined Dazzler's group of [[X-Men (Multiverse)|multiverse-hopping X-Men]]. She continued to pilot the stolen space-ship as they hunted down [[:Category:Ten Evil Xaviers|"evil" versions of Charles Xavier]]. At Dazzler's request, Sage also lent the team her capabilities as a telepath.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 2 7.1}}<!-- The reference template can't handle "7.1" properly. --> When the sorcerer [[Xavier (Earth-13059)|Lord Xavier]] possessed the team's own "[[Charles Xavier (Earth-TRN216)|Disembodied Xavier Head]]" and resurrected "[[Charles Xavier (Earth-13410)|Nazi Xavier]]", he then proceeded to feed a multidimensional rift that contributed to the [[Exterminators (Race)|Exterminators]] escaping their prison.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 2 12}} 

As the team attempted to deal with this threat they were joined by teams from other realities, and Sage and Dazzler were reunited with some of their former colleagues, including Wolverine and Gambit. Sage was teleported back to her home reality, where she interfaced with the "black box" of the [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|Dreaming Celestial]], uncovering the Exterminators' lost history.<!-- William Stryker (Earth-295) and Kurt Darkholme (Earth-295) accessed it earlier, but discovered less detail. --> In doing so, she also ascertained that the only way to defeat them was once again to imprison them within a single universe.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 61}} When this was accomplished, Sage was left in her home reality with her fellow X-Men.{{r|X-Termination #2}}

===Age of X-Man===
Several years<!--and one multiversal collapse--> of no-contact with her fellow X-Men ended when Jean Grey's worldwide call for all former X-Men to battle a [[Life Seed]]-altered [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]]. Sage combined her psychic offense with that of Jean, the [[Stepford Cuckoos]], [[Martha Johansson (Earth-616)|No-Girl]], and Psylocke, together ending X-Man's possession of [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]]. Despite this, X-Man released a final blast of energy that appeared to completely annihilate all of his opponents.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 10}}<!-- Sage's appearance in this issue was hinted at two issues prior in the editorial where a list of joking 2019 New-Year's resolutions for the X-Men concluded with Sage's resolution to appear in a comic book. -->

Those caught in the blast were transported by X-Man to a [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|reality]] he created through the power of a [[Life Seed]] and given new lives.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}} It's unrevealed if Sage was transported to the reality with the others. If she was, she would have been released by X-Man after realizing the flaws in his new world.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

===House of X===
[[File:Sage (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 6 6 001.jpg|thumb]]
Sage later went to live on the sovereign Mutant nation state of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], created by Charles Xavier, Magneto, and [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira X]], where she worked with [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]] in the center of the interface for the Krakoa's gateway system.{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}}

It is important to consider that Sage lost her home at a young age,<!-- chased? fled? abducted? we don't know --> and only a few years later, was a lone wanderer in a war-zone hundreds of miles away.<!-- To rescue Xavier, she must have been close to the border to Tibet (which will only be "China" for current maps) --> Exactly what traumas she experienced are unknown, but her experiences made her intensely self-reliant to the point that she rarely displays any weakness, nor does she readily ask others for assistance.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 44}}

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Sage does not value a sense of belonging over that of her cause, and will easily sacrifice her interpersonal relationships for her perception of the greater good.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 451|454}}

Sage wants to be in complete control of her situation at all times. To this end, she will engage in wide-spread surveillance while simultaneously employing secrecy even from those with which she works. Unfortunately, her allies are typically not soldiers, and as such, often resent being used as ignorant pawns, no matter how heroic the outcome or how justified the need for operational security<!-- (threat of telepaths reading their minds) -->.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 43}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 451|454}}{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 3}}

* At an unspecified time in her life, Sage was sold to a harem, but escaped.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 14}}
* Many telepaths demonstrate variants of her enhanced intelligence,{{r|Quentin Quire (Earth-616)#Powers}} and rapid information absorption.{{r|Charles Xavier (Earth-616)#Powers}}{{r|Emma Frost (Earth-616)#Powers}} It could be concluded that her computer-like mind is derived from her telepathy.
* While her rogue, manufactured personality, Diana Fox, was attempting to take over Sage's mind, Sage lost her detached emotional state,{{r|New Exiles Vol 1 9}} lost control of her telepathy,{{r|New Exiles Vol 1 5|7}} demonstrated self-propelled flight,{{r|New Exiles Vol 1 8}} and, when Diana briefly took control, her hair and eyes changed colour and she demonstrated a feat of super-strength.{{r|New Exiles Vol 1 10}} This incident could suggest Sage's underlying powers are the combined [[Telepathy|telepathy]]/[[Telekinesis|telekinesis]] suite seen in many other mutants, but maintaining her computer-mind state reduces the potential of her telekinesis to sensing and manipulating microscopic molecules.
* Sage has a pressure point on her body that allows her to reboot her mind like a computer.{{r|New X-Men #140}}
* There is often a misconception that Sage is able to control computers with her mind ([[Glossary:Cyberpathy|cyberpathy]]/[[Technopathy|technopathy]]), or that she is a cyborg. Neither is the case. Sage must interact with computers in a normal fashion, or through her augmented-reality glasses. Though she possesses computer or machine-like attributes, these abilities are all functions of her mutant powers.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 7}}{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 9}} The term "cyberpathy" was used to refer to the mental processing abilities and advanced control over her bodily functions rather than the ability to mentally control computers.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 40}} Sage is fully human (mutant) without any cybernetic enhancements.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 446}}
