The X-Men onboard a young [[Prophet-Singer (Earth-616)|Prophet-Singer]] (Acanti) were chased by the Brood fleet who attempted to capture the Prophet-Singer. After the X-Men teleported to the Brood base on [[Sleazeworld|Broodworld]], the Prophet-Singer left Broodworld and with [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] on board did battle with the Brood fleet, supported by Binary. When the tide begin to turn against them, the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]] arrived and engaged the Brood fleet. The battle ended when the soul of the previous Prophet-Singer was freed, the Brood Imperiax was crystallized, and the Broodworld exploded.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 166}}

When the Brood attempted an invasion of Earth, a Brood fleet of dozens of whaleships (Acanti) appeared over [[New York City]]. It deployed Brood warriors down to the city which did battle with the X-Men and [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] on the streets and in the skies. Using [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] created a psychic illusion of [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] and the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]], causing the Brood to panic and their forces to retreat from Earth.{{r|X-Men / Fantastic Four #4}}{{r|X-Men / Fantastic Four #5}} A few years after the [[Annihilation (Event)|Annihilation War]], the Brood were on the verge of extinction due to the [[Annihilation Wave (Earth-616)|Annihilation Wave]].{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 38}}

By the time of the [[Infinity (Event)|Builders' War]], the Brood had recovered and were once again one of the galactic powers. Whose horde was steadily growing, as more Brood were born. As the Brood were a member of the [[Galactic Council (Earth-616)|Galactic Council]], it's Living Armada had joined the [[Council Armada (Earth-616)|Council Armada]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 18}} Brood warships participated in various battles, including the disastrous battle at the Corridor (Acanti whaleships) in which a third of the Council Armada was lost in a minute and the battle to liberate Earth from Thanos and his Black Order ([[Starsharks]]).{{r|Avengers Vol 5 18}}{{r|Avengers Vol 5 23}}

Two years after the Builders' War, a Brood fleet escorted [[J'son (Earth-616)|Mister Knife]] and his Flying Fortress. They ended up in orbit over [[Spartax (Planet)|Spartax]], where Mr. Knife had [[Thane (Earth-616)|Thane]] use his power to encase Spartax in amber. It's billions were being given to the Brood as hosts as part of a deal, in which for every ten worlds the Brood conquered Mr. Knife would be given one. The fleet disgorged millions or billions of "infectoids", extremely small Brood-like creatures to burrow through the amber and skulls of the [[Spartax (Race)|Spartax]] to lay eggs in their brains.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 10}} Forcing [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]] to use the [[Black Vortex]] to become a cosmic being and thereby save Spartax.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 11|12}}
