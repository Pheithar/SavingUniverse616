| History                 = General Yuri{{r|Black Widow: The Coldest War Vol 1 1}} Brushov, reputedly the greatest military mind in the [[Russia|Soviet Union]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 44}} was invited by [[Wai Ling (Earth-616)|Colonel Ling]] to witness the [[Alexi Shostakov (Earth-616)|Red Guardian's]] prowess and Ling's weapon the [[Psychotron]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 43}} in a volcano base. Ling wanted to use the Psychotron along with Russian atomic submarines, but Brushov was not as convinced.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 44}}

Meeting the Red Guardian, Brushov wished to see the Red Guardian battling [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], and his dream came true when the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] bursted into his secret base to rescue Ling's prisoners [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]]. The Widow convinced Brushov that she had defected to Russia, so she was allowed to join them.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 44}}

Ling helped the Guardian defeat Captain America, but the Guardian disliked his methods. Then, Ling detected the Widow sabotaging the Psychotron and shot her, but the Guardian, who loved her, stopped the bullet. Meanwhile, Hawkeye released himself and surprised Brushov shooting him an arrow. Brushov fell on Ling, spoiling Ling's second shot. This and several other accidents caused Ling's base to explode.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 44}}

Brushov probably died in the fire, as he has not been seen since.
