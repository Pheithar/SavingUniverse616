| History                 = Null is a demonic entity created from the collective negative impulses of a seemingly impossibly benign (and now extinct) angelic race called the [[S'raphh]] who once lived on [[Luna (Moon)|Earth's Moon]]. After achieving full consciousness, it dominated the town of [[Christiansboro]], [[Virginia (State)|Virginia]] until driven off by [[Isaac Christians (Earth-616)|the Gargoyle]].{{r|Defenders Vol 1 103}} It subsequently possessed the body of Adam Henderson, using him as a pawn, but was defeated again, this time by the [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]].<ref>{{cl|Ghost Rider Vol 2 71}}</ref> Somehow, Null then managed to travel to [[Earth-712]] where it took over the United States with the assistance of the [[Grom (Earth-616)|Over-Mind]] but was driven off and seemingly destroyed by the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] and the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Squadron Supreme]].{{r|Defenders Vol 1 112|114}}
