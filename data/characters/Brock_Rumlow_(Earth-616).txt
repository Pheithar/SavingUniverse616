===Early Life===
Young '''Brock Rumlow''' led the Savage Crims gang on New York's lower east side.{{r|Captain America and Crossbones #1}} After he brutalized fifteen year old [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Rachel Leighton]], two of her brothers assaulted Brock and he killed them. Rumlow fled, entering the [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]]'s school for criminals, and within three years he became an instructor there under the name Bingo Brock.{{r|Captain America and Crossbones #1}}

===Crossbones===
As a mercenary, he enlisted with the communist [[Albert Malik (Earth-616)|Red Skull (Albert Malik)]] in [[Algeria]], serving him as "Frag" until he was sent to invade [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]]'s Switzerland chateau. Ultimately the only team member to survive the assault, Rumlow met and impressed the Nazi [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull (Johann Schmidt)]], who accepted Brock’s services, codenaming him "'''Crossbones'''".{{r|Captain America #383}}

===Captain America===
Sent to retrieve the five [[Bloodstone]] fragments of [[Ulysses Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Ulysses Bloodstone]], Crossbones shadowed [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Helmut Zemo]]'s search for them.{{r|Captain America #359}} While Zemo battled [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], Crossbones knocked out [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]'s pilot, [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]], and stole two Bloodstone fragments;{{r|Captain America #360}} when he got near the other three, the five combined to re-animate [[Heinrich Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Heinrich Zemo]]'s corpse under control of the alien Hellfire Helix.{{r|Captain America #361}} Unobserved, Crossbones destroyed the Helix (worn on the corpse's forehead) with a crossbow bolt.{{r|Captain America #362}} 

Brock then kidnapped Captain America's ally [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]] (whom he recognized as Rachel Leighton), using her as bait to trap Captain America in [[Madripoor]].{{r|Captain America #363}} Cap trapped him on a bomb in an abandoned building; but when the Skull learned of Crossbones involvement with the Captain, he ordered Crossbones to flee and he escaped just in time.{{r|Captain America #364}} Crossbones was then ordered to work with the [[Basil Sandhurst (Earth-616)|Controller]]-hypnotize [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] to attack Captain America.{{r|Captain America #365}} The Red Skull then ordered Crossbones to help a group of prisoners escape from the [[Vault]].{{r|Captain America #366}}

===Skeleton Crew===
Crossbones recruited the [[Basil Sandhurst (Earth-616)|Controller]] and [[Jason Cragg (Earth-616)|Voice]] to serve the Skull, led the [[Skeleton Crew (Earth-616)|Skeleton Crew]] against the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]]’s [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]], and, using psychic [[Tristram Micawber (Earth-616)|Tristram Micawber]], located the Skull after [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] had kidnapped him.{{r|Captain America #367}}{{r|Captain America #368|369}} Crossbones an the crew trap Cap and Diamondback in the [[Skull-House]].{{r|Captain America #370}}

Crossbones later attempted to assassinate the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]]{{r|Captain America #375|376}} but was stopped by [[Mary Walker (Earth-616)|Typhoid Mary]], and battled [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]] when the Kingpin retaliated.{{r|Captain America #377|378}}

Crossbones and the Skeleton Crew relaxed in their posh [[Washington, D.C.]] exclusive club. The party is spoiled when the Skull discovered someone has attacked Arnim Zola's compound and destroyed all of the Red Skull body double clones.{{r|Captain America #387}} Crossbones led the Skeleton Crew when they were captured by the [[Schutz Heiliggruppe (Earth-616)|Schutz Heiliggruppe]] ([[Franz Mittelstaedt (Earth-616)|Blitzkrieg]], [[Markus Ettlinger (Earth-616)|Hauptmann Deutschland]], [[Larry Ekler (Earth-616)|Zeitgeist]]);{{r|Captain America #389|390}} afterwards Arnim Zola rescued them.{{r|Captain America #391}} The team were almost arrested and taken in custody by the Avengers.{{r|Captain America #393}} The Red Skull faked the assassination of himself, [[Susan Scarbo (Earth-616)|Mother Night]], and Crossbones.{{r|Captain America #394}} The Red Skull finally fired Crossbones for questioning the Skull's decision to ally with the [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]].{{r|Captain America #395|396}} 

Crossbones headed east, working briefly in [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]] for drug lord Marco Sanzionare against [[Phil Grayfield (Earth-616)|Superpro]].{{r|NFL Superpro #8}}

In New York, Crossbones kidnapped Rachel to brainwash and torture her by abusing her repeatedly and forcing her through a rigid combat training routine.{{r|Captain America #397|399}} He had her call the [[Avengers Mansion]] to tell Cap not to look for her. [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] investigates Diamondback's phone call but finds nothing while Crossbones imprisons Diamondback in Magneto's fallout shelter.{{r|Captain America #401}} Crossbones forced Diamondback to steal Captain America's [[Glossary:S#Super-Soldier Serum|Super-Soldier Serum]] treated blood from Avengers Mansion.{{r|Captain America #402|408}}

Crossbones returned to the employ of the Red Skull and the Skeleton Crew.{{r|Captain America #409|410}} The new leader, [[Daniel Leighton (Earth-616)|Cutthroat]] (Diamondback's brother Daniel), plotted Crossbones' murder, Mother Night warned Brock, who slit Cutthroat's jugular. Diamondback escaped, summoning Captain America and the [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] to capture the Skull’s operatives; Crossbones was imprisoned, but eventually convinced officials he was rehabilitating, partly by defeating the terrorist cell "Fortress" when they invaded a Denver hospital. Exploiting his jailers' gullibility, Crossbones escaped, and was hired by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] to bomb New York's embassy row alongside the [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]], but the pair was stopped by Captain America. Betrayed by Hydra, Crossbones fled, wreaking vengeance on his bosses. {{r|Captain America Vol 3 24}}

===Gambit===
Crossbones was hired by [[New Sun (Earth-9921)|New Son]] to assassinate [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]],{{r|Gambit Vol 3 18|19}} but despite allying with [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc]] and [[Maximillian Zaran (Earth-616)|Zaran]], was defeated by the combined efforts of New Orleans' [[Assassins Guild (Earth-616)|Assassins Guild]] and [[Thieves Guild (Earth-616)|Thieves Guild]].{{r|Gambit Annual #2000}}

===The Death of Captain America===

The Skull promptly rehired him, and he was aiding in re-powering a [[Cosmic Cube]] when [[Aleksander Lukin (Earth-616)|Aleksander Lukin]]’s [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]] assassinated the Red Skull and stole the Cube. Lukin anonymously blamed Captain America for the Skull’s death, but Crossbones soon realized the truth and began hunting Lukin. He continued to go through with the Skull's plans, running an offshoot branch of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|AIM]], and kidnapping and brainwashing [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Sin (Synthia Schmidt)]], the daughter of the Red Skull.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 15}} The Red Skull eventually proved to have used the Cosmic Cube while dying to transfer his mind into Lukin's body, and he recruited Crossbones and Sin back into his service.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 21}}

During the superhero [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], he orchestrated the assassination of his longtime arch-foe, Captain America. The plan involved [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]] of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], one of Cap's closest allies, being brainwashed by [[Johann Fennhoff (Earth-616)|Doctor Faustus]] into shooting him at close range.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 25}} This was supplemented by shots fired by a sniper, specifically Crossbones. He was soon captured by S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 26|31}}

While in custody, he was interrogated by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], who had sneaked aboard the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]] aided by the magic of [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]].{{r|Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America #1}}

===Captain America: Reborn===
Crossbones and Sin escaped from a [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] holding facility in [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]]. [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] approached the duo for a mission. Working with the Red Skull again, they attempted to transfer the Skull's consciousness into the preserved body of Steve Rogers. Instead, the Skull was apparently deleted and the original Captain America was alive again.{{r|Captain America: Reborn #1|6}}

===Luke Cage's Thunderbolts===
He was recruited to be a new member of the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] led by [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]], and was participating in the assaults on the New York fortress of the Hand. While on a mission in New Guinea he breathed in the [[Terrigen Mist]] and gained energy blast powers. While on a mission with the Avengers, Brock, Juggernaut and Ghost threw off the teleportation signal and ended up in a different dimension together with the Avengers. Brock attempted to kill Captain America but he was thrown into a strange pool of water that reversed the effects of the Terrigen Mist and cost him his powers. After the mission he was taken off the Thunderbolts and returned to incarceration.{{r|Thunderbolts #144|150}}

===Working For the Man===
During his time in custody, Crossbones was sent to an isolated island that was hit by a terrible virus outbreak. Brock was sent in with one objective: rescue the one person who may possess the resistance to the virus. Heavily armed, Brock eventually meets a camp of survivors on the island. It turns out the individual is just a boy, and Brock betrays the survivors by letting the monsters (who are essentially werewolves) into their base. Brock battles a few, snapping their necks and withstanding a handful of claw attacks before reaching his evacuation helicopter with the child. But, Brock betrays his employers by pushing the boy out of the helicopter, sending him falling to his death.{{r|Captain America and Crossbones #1}}

===The Fearless===
During the [[Fear Itself|Serpent War]], one of the mystical hammers of the [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]] fell into the Raft, choosing [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] as its wielder. Marko's transformation into [[Kuurth]] caused massive damage to the Raft, which led to a breakout. Crossbones seized his chance to escape, and worked with Man Mountain Mario to achieve his goal, and repaid Mario by murdering him.{{r|Thunderbolts #159}}

When Sin was in search of the missing hammers of the [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]], Crossbones helped her by globe-trotting to find these items.{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #1|3}} His journey took him to French waters, where he confronted Namor,{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #4}} and New York City, where he fought against Luke Cage.{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #5|6}}

In a brutal fight with Wolverine, Crossbones was critically injured, but was healed by [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]].{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #7|10}} Crossbones and Sin subsequently joined the [[Department of Occult Armaments (Earth-616)|D.O.A.]].{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #11|12}}

===Ends of the Earth===
Crossbones was seen in one of Doctor Octopus' facilities. [[Ruth Bat-Seraph (Earth-616)|Sabra]] fought her way past some [[Octobots]] until Crossbones shot her.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth #1}}

[[File:Venom Vol 2 42 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
===Mania===
While hunting [[Hell-Mark]]s through the country, Crossbones killed and skinned one of the many copies of Daimon Hellstrom. Along with the D.O.A., Crossbones targeted [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Mania]] as she had received the Hell-Mark that was once of [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Venom]] along with [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|her symbiote]].{{r|Venom Vol 2 40}} After battling Venom and Mania, who had used the demons that [[Martin Preston (Earth-616)|Master Mayhem]] had summoned to attack them, he and some members of the D.O.A. vanished.{{r|Venom Vol 2 41|42}}

===All-New Captain America===
When Steve Rogers' son [[Ian Rogers (Earth-616)|Ian Zola]] and All-New Captain America [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Sam Wilson]] were teleported from [[Ecuador]] to the new Hydra's main basement in [[Bagalia]], Crossbones was there with several other new Hydra members, including their leader, [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]]. Sam and Ian engaged a war with them: Cap took the mysterious kid they saved in Ecuador, running away from the basement, with Brock following them. The kid was revealed to be an Hydra agent, an [[Inhomo supremis|Inhuman]] "created" by the [[Terrigen Mist]] with the Mist "Infection Power" in his blood. Cap, wounded, started a fight with Crossbones, but Wilson was saved by an undercover [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]]. He was later defeated by Sam Wilson when he attacked a Hydra base located in [[Florida (State)|Florida]].{{r|All-New Captain America #1|4}}

===Pleasant Hill===
Crossbones was an inmate of [[Pleasant Hill]], a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. When Steve Rogers was at the Pleasant Hill Bowling Alley trying to reason with [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]], Crossbones attacked Rogers. Before Crossbones could kill Rogers, Kobik used her powers to de-age Rogers back to his physical prime, which allowed him to defeat Crossbones.{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson Vol 1 7}} In the aftermath of the events at Pleasant Hill, Crossbones founded a new version of Hydra with the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] and Sin.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Omega Vol 1 1}}

===[[Secret Empire (Event)|Secret Empire]]===
Crossbones and Sin were shown to be in charge of a super-prison that was established by Hydra. Their super-prison was raided by the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]] in their mission to free their captive friends.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 #8}}
