===Origin===
The daughter of two prosperous [[Hong Kong]] immigrants, '''Jubilation "Jubilee" Lee''', was born and raised in [[Beverly Hills]], [[California (State)|California]], and lived a charmed life. Jubilee attended an exclusive Beverly Hills school, where she discovered her great talent for gymnastics.{{r|Women of Marvel: Celebrating Seven Decades Handbook Vol 1 1}}

Jubilee first discovered her [[Homo superior|mutant]] [[X-Gene|power]] to generate blinding and explosive energy "fireworks", while running away from mall security. The stress of running away from the security guards caused Jubilee to emit a large light energy blast while in a back alley. This completely disoriented the men and allowed the frightened young girl to escape.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 24}}

Her life changed completely in one night, when her parents were killed in a mysterious car accident, leaving Jubilee with no one to turn to.{{r|Generation X Annual Vol 1 1999}}<!--The story of Wolverine Vol 2 #72 was slightly retconned by Gen X Annual #1999-->

[[File:Jubilation Lee (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 244 002.png|150px|thumb|left|Hiding in the X-Men Australian Base]]
Jubilee was then sent to an orphanage, but ran away and hid in a Hollywood shopping mall.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 72}} Frustrated with the young girl's rebellious nature and powerful light-shows, the mall security hired mutant hunters, known as the [[M-Squad (Earth-616)|M-Squad]], to capture her. Jubilee held her own by blasting the M-Squad's energy tractor beams, but she was eventually caught. Lucky for her, Jubilee was rescued by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]], [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]], [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], who happened to be shopping at the mall. Curious about these strange women, she followed them for a while and later jumped into a portal after them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 244}}

===Meeting the X-Men===
On the other side of the portal, Jubilee found herself at the X-Men's temporary [[Cooterman's Creek|base]] in the [[Australia]]n outback. Jubilee stayed hidden and, while living in the underground base, the mutant known as [[Gateway (Earth-616)|Gateway]] was the only person aware of Jubilee's existence. During her stay in the base, Jubilee stowed away in Dazzler's quarters and found an immediate kinship, in the extent of [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Alison Blaire's]] wardrobe. Jubilee stole food and borrowed clothes from several of the X-Men to create a makeshift costume for herself.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 13}} Jubilee was present when [[Nanny (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Nanny]] and [[Orphan-Maker (Peter) (Earth-616)|Orphan-Maker]] ambushed the X-Men at their base, but simply hid while the battle ensued.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 248}} Once while the X-Men were out, Jubilee was harassed and hounded by a Reaver guard dog that was left at the base. Jubilee stayed in hiding until the X-Men had abandoned the base, and their enemies the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]] had captured [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and taken over the base.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 251}}

While sneaking around the caverns in the outback base, Jubilee was startled to find Wolverine hung up on a cross and near death. Jubilee helped Wolverine get down from the cross, and nursed him back to health.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 251|253}} Together, they travelled to [[Hong Kong]], where they learned that the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]] had consolidated his control over Hong Kong's criminal scene by allying himself with The [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]]. As they investigated, they were ambushed and captured by Mandarin's prime assassin, Lady Mandarin. It was then revealed that Lady Mandarin was actually Psylocke, brainwashed and transferred into an Asian body. After Psylocke established a mental link with Wolverine upon attacking him with her psychic knife, the backlash of memories of the X-Men broke her free, leading the Mandarin's defeat. During this time, Jubilee held her own against The Hand and blew up a section of the Mandarin's castle with her powers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 256|258}}

After hearing of mutants being attacked on the island nation of Genosha, the trio made their way there, meeting [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom Boom]] and [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]], who had lost their powers. Jubilee was left taking care of the depowered mutants, while Wolverine and Psylocke infiltrated [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]]'s Citadel. Despite some friction between them, the young mutants managed to avoid capture several times and make their own way into the citadel, where they joined the other X-teams for the final stand against Hodge.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 271|272}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 62}}
[[File:James Howlett (Earth-616), Jubilation Lee (Earth-616) and Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 271 001.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Adventures with Wolverine]]

Upon returning to the United States, Jubilee joined Storm, Wolverine, Psylocke, [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]], [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], and [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] as a member of the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 273}} Although she accompanied them on many of their missions, they remained wary of placing her in harm's way because of her young age. When Wolverine was kidnapped by The Hand,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 4}} Jubilee argued that she should be allowed to help (as she had previously fought and defeated The Hand), and found an unlikely ally in Psylocke.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 5}} After run-ins with the [[Skrulls]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 275}} the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]],{{r|X-Men Vol 2 9}} [[Arkady Rossovich (Earth-616)|Omega Red]],{{r|X-Men Vol 2 4}} and [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]],{{r|X-Men Vol 2 10|11}} Jubilee was finally made to stay at the mansion by the X-Men due to her age.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 13}}

Jubilee and Wolverine grew a close father-daughter relationship with one another. Jubilee needed the guidance of a parent, while Wolverine needed the peace and joy of a child. The duo teamed up to fight [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 46}} Omega Red,{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 61}} [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 69|71}} [[Sentinels]], and even sought revenge on [[Reno (Earth-616)|Reno]] and [[Molokai (Earth-616)|Molokai]], who she believed had murdered of her parents.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 72|74}}

[[File:Captain America Vol 9 5 Uncanny X-Men Variant Textless.jpg|180px|thumb|left]]
When [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] was almost killed by a villain named [[Nathan Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]], who appeared to be [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], the X-Men were quick to suspect Cable of the deed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 294}} It was Jubilee who persuaded the X-Men that he might not be the culprit, as no one knew what Stryfe really looked like, and he could therefore be disguised as Cable.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 295}} Once Professor X was cured and regained the use of his legs for a short time, Jubilee took him rollerblading to cheer him up. After spending some time bonding with him she realized that he wasn't the stuffy old man she took him for, and they grew closer. After his legs began to weaken, Jubilee helped him back into his wheelchair, realizing that just being there to help meant more to him than anything she could say.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 297}}

Back at the mansion, Jubilee became close friends with [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]]'s little sister [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Illyana]]. When Illyana was diagnosed with the [[Legacy Virus]], Jubilee spent all of her time at Illyana’s bedside. When [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] arrived, Jubilee was jealous of her at first, because she was Wolverine's first sidekick, but the two soon formed a friendship. Despite all their attempts, the X-Men were unable to save Illyana. Jubilee takes her death extremely hard, almost as bad as Colossus.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 302|303}} Several weeks later, after [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] violently removed the [[Adamantium]] from Wolverine's skeleton, Logan decided to leave the X-Men, fearing that he was a liability to them. Knowing how much this would affect Jubilee, he wrote her a touching goodbye letter and left his favorite cowboy hat for her.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 75}} A short time later, [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] was brought to the mansion by Professor X and held in captivity there.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 3}} Jubilee was terrified of him, and had nightmares of him killing the X-Men and leaving her for last. Attempting to get over her fears she began to bring food to Sabretooth, who taunted the poor girl mercilessly.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 28}} One night her nightmares almost came true when the mansion's security system went down and Sabretooth escaped from his cell. He hunted the X-Men throughout the mansion, but in the end it was Jubilee who took him down with a neutralizer pistol.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 311}}

With the other X-Men busy, Banshee was the only person to notice that Jubilee was having trouble coping with Wolverine's absence, as well as all that had happened to her since he left. When the [[Phalanx]] assimilated most of the X-Men, Jubilee and Banshee were forced to team up with Sabretooth and [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] (who had recently awoken from a coma in the mansion's medical facility) to escape from them. This unusual group worked together to gather all the young mutants listed by Professor X as future allies. The Phalanx was later defeated thanks to the sacrifice of a young mutant girl named [[Clarice Ferguson (Earth-616)|Blink]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 36|37}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 316|317}}

===Generation X===
Feeling that she needed a rest from the stresses at the mansion, Jubilee volunteered to join a new group of teenage mutants known as [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]]. The team was led by both Banshee and Emma Frost, and was comprised mainly of Jubilee, [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]], [[Everett Thomas (Earth-616)|Synch]], [[Claudette and Nicole St. Croix (Earth-616)|M]], [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]], [[Angelo Espinosa (Earth-616)|Skin]], and [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Penance]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 318}}{{r|Generation X #1}}
[[File:Generation X Vol 1 24 Textless.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Jubilee and the girls of Gen X]]

Both Banshee and Emma Frost educated the teenagers in school subjects as well as combat and field skills. Jubilee and the other mutant teens honed their unique abilities and occasionally battled minions such as the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]], Omega Red, and their arch-rival [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]].{{r|Generation X Vol 1 1}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 11}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 21}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 60|61}} Time after time, Jubilee used her experience with the X-Men to help her teammates outsmart their enemies. On one occasion, Jubilee used her sarcasm when Emplate siphoned her powers so that he would become enraged enough to not have control over them, causing him to blast himself with Jubilee's energy blasts.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 14}} Another time, Jubilee blew up Proudstar Hall in order to defeat him. Her teammates survived the massive explosion, covered with an ice shield by [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]].{{r|Generation X Vol 1 57}}

During her stay at the [[Massachusetts Academy]], Jubilee was kidnapped and held hostage by [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]] during [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]. She managed to resist his mental probes for a good amount of time, hiding valuable information on the X-Men. Jubilee staged an escape early on after being kidnapped, literally knocking several armed soldiers unconscious with a large plasma volley. Her innocence and morals led to her capture once more, as she decided to give CPR to one of the guards she injured. She eventually escaped with the help of Bastion's assistant [[Sentinel (Daria) (Earth-616)|Daria]]. While wandering the desert after her getaway, she was attacked by a [[Prime Sentinels (Earth-616)|Prime Sentinel]] and held her own by blasting his vision receptors.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 25|31}} She was saved at the last minute by Wolverine, who took her back to the X-Men until she was comfortable enough to return to Generation X.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 117}}

[[File:Jubilation Lee (Earth-616) from Generation X Vol 1 61 cover.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Second Gen X Costume]]
One of the most important details from her time with Generation X was when she discovered the true killer of her parents, [[Hunter Brawn (Earth-616)|Hunter Brawn]]. She staged a solo operation, using all of her powers, skills, and abilities to track down Brawn. With the help of her friends and teammates, she managed to take him down. Enraged at how he had destroyed her family, her powers flared to a massive level. Instead of killing the man, she took out her aggression and blew up his warehouse, leaving him to be arrested by local authorities.{{r|Generation X Annual Vol 1 1999}}

After Generation X disbanded, Jubilee moved to L.A. with former teammate Skin to pursue an acting career. She was unfortunately cast in stereotypical Asian roles, and after her agent tried to seduce her, she blasted him with a powerful plasma blast.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 34}}

===X-Corps===
Around this time she was offered a position on Banshee's militaristic [[X-Corps (Earth-616)|X-Corps]] team, alongside former teammates Husk and M. The three young women hesitantly joined Banshee in order to keep an eye on him. During her run with the X-Corps, Jubilee held off an uprising in [[Paris]] by blinding hostile enemies. Jubilee and Husk, with the help of [[Miranda Leevald (Earth-616)|Stacy X]], also managed to take down the [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]] and rescue Banshee from [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 403|406}}

===Holy War===
Jubilee returned to L.A. with Skin, but the two of them along with [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]] and other mutants were kidnapped and crucified on the front lawn of the X-Mansion by the [[Church of Humanity (Earth-616)|Church of Humanity]]. Jubilee and Magma recovered from the attack because of [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]]'s healing blood, but Skin and the others weren't so fortunate.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 423}} Jubilee became slightly depressed due to the loss of her friend and reunited with her friend Husk. The two of them, along with Angel, attended Skin's funeral. Since the grave keeper wouldn't allow a mutant to be buried in his cemetery, he had Skin cremated and unemotionally handed Jubilee Skin's ashes. From then on, Jubilee went on a few missions with [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]]'s Uncanny team, but was taken off of the active roster when [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] decided Jubilee needed a mental break.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 157}}{{r|Jubilee Vol 1 1}}

===Aunt Hope===
Jubilee was contacted by a long lost relative, her [[Hope Lee (Earth-616)|Aunt Hope]]. Hope decided to adopt Jubilee and take her into her home in Los Angeles, which gave Jubilation a much-needed break from mansion life. Jubilee attended [[Payton Noble High School]] and became a peer adviser. She got into a few fights in school, and was reprimanded because of her power display. She also befriended a mutant named [[Shane Shooter (Earth-616)|Shane Shooter]], and helped him take down a gang leader. Unfortunately for Jubilee, her aunt was caught in a crime ring, as she was an assassin.{{r|{{cl|Jubilee Vol 1 1}}-[[Jubilee Vol 1 2|2]]}}

While Wolverine was visiting Jubilee, the two of them along with her aunt (and her butler Brad) got into a battle with Hope's old boss. Hope was caught in a violent explosion and seemingly died, causing a distraught Jubilee to move back to the mansion with Wolverine.{{r|Jubilee Vol 1 6}}

===[[Decimation]]===
After the [[Earth-58163|House of M]], Jubilee was one of the mutants affected by [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]'s reality altering wave and lost her powers.{{r|Decimation: House of M - The Day After Vol 1}} When [[Sally Floyd (Earth-616)|Sally Floyd]] tried to get in touch with the X-Men regarding the sudden depowering of most of the mutants, Jubilee did what she could to help, but since she was no longer a mutant she could not go back to the Xavier Institute and was instead working as a political activist against [[Eugene Sykes (Earth-616)|Congressman Sykes]].{{r|Generation M #2}}

Jubilee relocated to [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]], apparently operating a safe house for depowered mutants. She allowed Wolverine to visit [[Christoph Nord (Earth-616)|Agent Zero]], but the facility soon came under attack by Omega Red. Jubilee was kidnapped by Arkady and seriously injured when Wolverine tried to save her. He had to surrender to [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents that were hunting him in order to make sure she got medical treatment.{{r|Wolverine: Origins Vol 1 7|10}}

Jubilee made a full recovery, but, for a while, she thought Wolverine had abandoned her.{{r|New Warriors Vol 4 3}}

===New Warriors===
Jubilee was invited by [[Donyell Taylor (Earth-616)|Night Thrasher]] to join a new incarnation of the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]], composed mainly of depowered mutants. This new team was equipped with reverse-engineered technology that gave them new powers to fight crime while going against the government's registration act, adopted after the first superhuman civil war. Among her new teammates was her close acquaintance Jono Starsmore,{{r|New Warriors Vol 4 3}} the former mutant Chamber, who had also been depowered after M-Day.{{r|New Warriors Vol 4 9}}

[[File:Jubilation Lee (Earth-616) from New Warriors Vol 4 4 002.jpg|160px|thumb|right|As Wondra]]
Jubilee assumed the identity of '''Wondra''' and was equipped with a power suit capable of lifting a freight train over her head.{{r|New Warriors Vol 4 2}} She acted as [[Donyell Taylor (Earth-616)|Night Thrasher]]'s second-in-command and was responsible for the team's training sessions. As pointed out by [[Sofia Mantega (Earth-616)|Sofia Mantega]], Jubilee had a tougher exterior than years past, likely due to her responsibilities of training the team.{{r|New Warriors Vol 4 3|4}}

After a few months working hard,{{r|New Warriors Vol 4 6}} Wondra and the New Warriors apprehended numerous villains like the [[Paul Duval (Earth-616)|Grey Gargoyle]], [[Blanche Sitznski (Earth-616)|Anaconda]] and the [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]], never missing the chance to publicly slam Tony Stark and the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]].{{r|{{cl|New Warriors Vol 4 1}}-[[New Warriors Vol 4 2|2]]}}

Their perfect strike would however be wrecked after their confrontation with the new [[Zodiac (Baal Abib) (Earth-616)|Zodiac]]. During the battle, [[Christine Cord (Earth-616)|Longstrike]] was killed, and Sofia was gravely injured, after a surprise appearance that gave the team a winning chance. In the aftermath of the tragedy, Night Thrasher decided to disband the team, not wanting anyone else to die on his watch. Jubilee, unwilling to lose the new family she had found, visited Sofia at the Hospital and convinced her to come back to HQ with her, where she gave a speech to increase team morale. After hearing her words, they decided to remain as a team, with or without Night Thrasher. However, he too was moved by their dedication and chose to remain with the Warriors and train them even harder.{{r|{{cl|New Warriors Vol 4 4}}-[[New Warriors Vol 4 6|6]]}}

[[File:Jubilation Lee (Earth-616) and Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616) from New Warriors Vol 4 9 001.jpg|220px|thumb|left|With Jono]]
The following days, Night Thrasher became increasingly absent during key moments in their missions and still refused to reveal his true identity to the team, making Jubilee suspicious of him. However, without the support of her teammates, she had to cease hostilities. This would soon change after their mission to take out the [[Samuel Saxon (Earth-616)|Machinesmith]], when Jubilee discovered that they'd been lied about the true reason for their attack. With the support of her team at last, Jubilee tried to confront Thrasher again, but Jono's grave injuries sustained during the battle provided an excuse to delay this further.{{r|New Warriors Vol 4 9|13}}

After Jono's recovery, the team followed Thrasher during one of his disappearances and found themselves in a confrontation with [[Counter Force (Earth-616)|Counter Force]]. In the climax of the battle, realizing there was no simpler way to end the conflict, Donyell finally revealed his true identity to both the former and current Warriors.{{r|New Warriors Vol 4 14|15}}

[[File:Jubilation Lee (Earth-616) from New Warriors Vol 4 13 001.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Second Suit]]
When [[Vincent Stewart (Earth-616)|Skybolt]] and Ripcord (formerly Stacy X) were killed during a confrontation with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Task Force, Donyell revealed he had been working on a time machine to travel back in time and save the New Warriors to prevent the Civil War. Jubilee was once again upset that he was keeping things from them, but when the Task Force surrounded them with no way of escaping, their only chance was to jump in time and hope for the best. The machine didn't work as planned and sent the New Warriors into a [[Earth-81156|dystopian future]] where Donyell's brother, [[Dwayne Taylor (Earth-81156)|Dwayne]], had returned and taken the Registration Act to the extreme by removing all super-powered beings to the Nth dimension. The New Warriors weren't keen on getting involved, but with the only way back home being the time machine inside the Stark/Taylor Building, they were left with no choice but to break in the building and confront Dwayne. Despite having misgivings about Dwayne's totalitarian rule, Donyell's need to reconnect with his brother led him to betray the New Warriors. However, after Dwayne tortured and killed [[Anthony Stark (Earth-81156)|Tony Stark]], Donyell came to his senses, rescuing the others and killing his brother in self-defense. Upon their return to the present, Jubilee realized the New Warriors were too dangerous and they parted ways, still thankful for the time they'd spent together.{{r|New Warriors Vol 4 16|20}}

===Vampire Times===
After leaving the New Warriors, Jubilee made her way to the West Coast again, more specifically to San Francisco, where the X-Men had settled following the destruction of the Xavier Institute. Jubilee had remained in contact with many of the next generation students, and met with a group of them at [[Fisherman's Wharf]]. The younger kids updated Jubilee on the status of the new island of [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], which acted as a new home for the remaining mutants on Earth. When asked to return to Utopia with them, however, Jubilee decided against going to an island of mutants when she was no longer one. Instead, she had a letter delivered to Wolverine saying simply "Wish you were here."{{r|Nation X #2}}

[[File:X-Men Vol 3 3 Textless 2nd Printing Variant.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Biting Logan]]
While [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] and Jubilee hung out in [[Union Square (San Francisco)|Union Square]], a vampiric suicide bomber exploded nearby, coating the area, and Jubilee, in blood. Later on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Dr. Nemesis]] discovered that Jubilee had been infected with vampire blood that would slowly overtake her. Ultimately, a hypnotic suggestion took over her and she fled to her masters. After being bitten by [[Xarus (Earth-616)|Xarus]], son of [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]], Jubilee became a full-fledged [[Vampires|vampire]]. Wolverine chased after her and Xarus used Jubilee as bait to draw him in. Jubilee turned Wolverine and he led the army of vampires that attacked Utopia. It was revealed that Cyclops had planned for the event and had Nemesis implant nanites in Wolverine's blood. After Dracula killed Xarus and the X-Men defeated the vampire army, Jubilee was released into the X-Men's care and placed into a cell until a cure could be found.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 3 1}}-[[X-Men Vol 3 6|6]]}}

Jubilee, along with Wolverine and Gambit, briefly teamed up with X-23 when Laura was in Paris. Jubilee helped Laura cope with depression, and the two formed a strong friendship.{{r|X-23 Vol 3 12}}

She was later taken in as a student by a group of vampires called [[Forgiven (Earth-616)|the Forgiven]], who had learned to move beyond their need for blood and could move about in the day.{{r|X-Men Vol 3 #27}}

During the first brawl of the [[Avengers vs. X-Men]] conflict on the beach of Utopia, Jubilee battled [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]].{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 2}}

[[File:X-Men Vol 4 13 Textless.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Vampire Jubilee with Shogo]]
Now a young adult, Jubilee discovered a [[Shogo Lee (Earth-616)|baby boy]] alone in Budapest. She named him Shogo and brought him back to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School]], where she reunited with her X-Men teammates, including principal members Storm, Psylocke, [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]], Kitty Pryde, and Rogue.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 1}} Jubilee was field leader when she and X-Men teammates Pixie, [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]], [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]], [[Roxanne Washington (Earth-616)|Bling!]], [[Karima Shapandar (Earth-616)|Karima]], and [[Alisa Tager (Earth-616)|Cipher]] fought Sentinels on [[Santa Catalina Island]].{{r|X-Men Vol 4 11}}

Sometime later, Storm informed her that the adoption papers had gone through, legally making Jubilee the mother of Shogo.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 7}}

===Vampire No More===
Despite her newfound duties as a mother, Jubilee felt capable of becoming a mentor to the younger generation of students and assured Kitty, who'd become the headmaster at Xavier's, she was excited about the job. Helping with this herculean task was Jono Starsmore, her former teammate at Generation X and the New Warriors.{{r|Generation X Vol 2 1|3}}

[[File:Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616), Jubilation Lee (Earth-616) and Shogo Lee (Earth-616) from Generation X Vol 1 87 001.jpg|left|thumb|With Shogo and Jono]]
Jubilee and Jono would be reunited with yet another former teammate when they discovered [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet St. Croix]] had merged with her brother, [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]], and was attacking the students at night to absorb their life energy. They manage to drive her away, but decided to implement curfews for the students and start performing surveillance rounds to prevent future attacks.{{r|Generation X Vol 2 4}}{{r|Generation X Vol 2 6}}

Bonding during their surveillance walks and through misadventures involving Shogo and their students, Jubilee and Jono grew closer and got romantically involved.{{r|Generation X Vol 2 1}}{{r|{{cl|Generation X Vol 2 6}}-[[Generation X Vol 2 7|7]]}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 85|87}}

When Monet finally attacked the school again, now during the day, she took away the [[Lightbender Amulet|medallion]] Jubilee used as protection from sunlight, and then threw her out the window. Witnessing this, [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]] sacrificed the fragment of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] he carried within him to cure her of her vampirism and restore her original powers in the process, thus allowing her to attack Monet and buy her students enough time to come up with a plan to free her from Marius's control.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 85|87}}

===[[Age of X-Man (Event)|Age of X-Man]]===
In the reality created by [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]] and a [[Life Seed]], a world where everyone on Earth was a mutant and relationships were strongly discouraged or illegal, Jubilee was a member of [[Department X (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Department X]], the police force in charge of investigating and arresting dissident mutants.{{r|Age of X-Man: X-Tremists Vol 1 1}}

Once, Department X was tasked with capturing recurrent love criminals [[Luke (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Luke]] and [[Nezumi Sen (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Nezumi Sen]]. This would turn out to be anything but a routine arrest, however, when Nezumi revealed to Blob that she was pregnant, an unprecedented case for anyone in the Department. Flummoxed by this revelation, Blob consulted with his teammates for confirmation of the pregnancy. Eventually, the group opted to deliver Luke at Cerebro, but keep Nezumi and decide what to do with her afterward.{{r|Age of X-Man: X-Tremists Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Jubilation Lee (Earth-616) from Age of X-Man X-Tremists Vol 1 2 001.png|180px|thumb|right]]
Sometime later, Jubilee was horrified to find Nezumi chained up in the Department's basement, an obvious victim to mistreatment at the hand of her teammate [[Moneta (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Moneta]]. After making Moneta leave, Jubilee apologized, but Nezumi accused her of being complicit and mindfully ignorant of the torture.{{r|Age of X-Man: X-Tremists Vol 1 2}}

One day, while alone at headquarters, a swarm of rats surrounded Jubilee, called forth by an escaped and pissed off Nezumi. She had given birth alone in the basement and escaped captivity with her newborn baby after she'd summoned thousands of rats to chew her chains. Seeing Nezumi's newborn baby triggered Jubilee's memory of her son, Shogo, so, to Nezumi's surprise, she proceeded to show her how to swaddle the baby and offered to help them escape custody. Upon finding the department's van outside a local beatnik club, Jubilee entered the premises to find Moneta's murdered body, only stopping to check the body for the van's keys before leaving. Knowing it wasn't the real world, Jubilee then robbed three banks and a grocery store for Nezumi's getaway. Fully stocked, Nezumi and her baby departed on the van for parts unknown.{{r|Age of X-Man: X-Tremists Vol 1 5}}

Jubilee later returned to the mainstream reality and was present at the party celebrating the new mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}} She was reunited with Shogo,{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 1}} who had been taken care of by Chamber{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 14}} and [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 18}} and went on to join the new iteration of [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 4}}

'''Lumikinetic Explosive Light Blasting:'''{{r|Wolverine Annual Vol 4 1}} Jubilee possesses the mutant ability to generate what she calls "'''fireworks'''"{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: X-Men 2005 Vol 1 1}} (also known as '''Energy Plasmoids''' or "'''Lumikinetic Explosive Light Blasts'''":{{r|Wolverine Annual Vol 4 1}}). These are essentially globules of energy that vary in power and intensity. The explosions can result in anything from a multitude of colorful sparkles, capable of temporarily blinding a person, to a fairly powerful detonation capable of smashing tree trunks or metal objects. Jubilee can also absorb the generated fireworks back into her own body without harm.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: X-Men 2005 Vol 1 1}} According to Emma Frost, she has the potential to detonate matter at a sub-atomic level.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 36}}
