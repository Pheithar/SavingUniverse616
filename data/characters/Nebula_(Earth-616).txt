| History                 = '''Nebula''' was the adopted daughter of [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]], a conqueror who raised her alongside his other daughter [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]] whom he openly preferred over Nebula. This caused Nebula to develop a hatred towards her sister, though she was warned by Thanos that killing Gamora would incur his wrath. To get around his words, Nebula slipped her sister information that the last member of the [[Badoon]] royal family that genocided [[Zen-Whoberis|her people]] was living on [[Ubliex]], knowing that Gamora would follow there to finish her revenge. Ubliex was orbiting a Black Hole, with no ship able to escape its gravitational pull, and Nebula hoped that leading Gamora to the death caused by her own actions would spare her from Thanos' wrath.{{r|Gamora Vol 1 1}}

Little is known about the life of Nebula before the time she hijacked [[Sanctuary (Vehicle)|Sanctuary II]], the solar orbiting satellite built and used as a base of operations by [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]]. A short time before Thanos became permanently transfixed between life and death, Nebula sent a small band of her most trusted aides to Sanctuary II to repair its hyperdrive engines and teleport the station out of the solar system. The underlings were met by the Avenger then known as [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], who had been sent to investigate possible activity. Nebula's minions warped the satellite out of the solar system with Captain Marvel aboard and rendezvoused with Nebula. She planned to conquer the [[Skrulls|Skrull]] empire, which was then in chaos after the destruction of its throneworld by the planet-devourer [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]]. Not knowing how to return home, Captain Marvel pretended to go along with Nebula's scheme, but actually helped the Skrulls evacuate the outpost world Nebula was intent on destroying.{{r|Avengers #257|259}}

The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] eventually located their missing member and allied themselves with the Skrulls to oppose her. Before the Avengers could catch up to Nebula, she annihilated both the Skrull outpost and the planet [[Xandar]], home planet of [[Firelord]]. In battle with Nebula, the Avenger [[Eros (Earth-616)|Starfox]], brother of Thanos, learned that Nebula was apparently Thanos's granddaughter and thus his own grandniece. Shortly thereafter, the virtually omnipotent [[Beyonder]], curious about the Avengers, arrived, and in an attempt to help the Avengers vanquish Nebula, helped her and her minions to escape by teleporting them out of the Andromeda Galaxy.{{r|Avengers #260}}

Sometime after all this, while Firelord and Starfox were searching known space for Nebula, Thanos was reborn. One of his first tasks was to reclaim [[Sanctuary (Vehicle)|Sanctuary III]]. When he found Nebula there, she claimed to be his granddaughter so he torched her body and left her on the brink of death, where she hovered until the affair of the [[Infinity Gauntlet]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #38}} For whatever reason, Thanos left Nebula to roam around his shrine as he battled all manner of beings to keep the Gauntlet. After Thanos defeated [[Eternity]] and left his body, Nebula claimed the Gauntlet and fully restored herself to life as she achieved omnipotence. She eventually lost the Gauntlet to [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]] and was placed in the custody of Firelord and Starfox.{{r|Infinity Gauntlet #5|6}}

Later one of her crew freed Nebula from her cell on Titan, finding her in a catatonic state. After surgery to restore her to her former mental capacity (if not her former looks) she battled the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] and [[Jonathan Hart (Earth-616)|Jack of Hearts]]. She killed her crew in escaping.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #69|78}}

Nebula later resurfaced as a member of the [[Graces (Earth-616)|Graces]], [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]]'s group of female warriors. She battled [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan the Accuser]] alongside [[Stellaris (Earth-616)|Stellaris]]. Ronan triumphed, severely wounding her.{{r|Annihilation: Ronan #2}} She later fought side-by-side the other Graces, defending their base of operations from the [[Annihilation Wave]].{{r|Annihilation Vol 1 6}}

After Thanos' son [[Thane (Earth-616)|Thane]] decided to orchestrate a plan to kill his progenitor, he enlisted the help of Nebula, Starfox and [[Tryco Slatterus (Earth-616)|Champion]].{{r|Thanos Vol 2 2}} As part of his plan, Thane deceived them into helping him invade [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax]]'s warship to steal a [[Phoenix Egg]] in his possession.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 5}} Upon discovering the truth, Nebula killed Thane to prevent him from opening the egg, but his death just made the egg hatch and allowed the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] to turn him into its new host.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 6}} Thane's former allies sought Thanos' help to stop Thane, and in turn Thanos had them take him to the [[Quarry of Creation|God Quarry]] so that he could acquire the power he needed to defeat his son.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 8}} Following Thane's defeat,{{r|Thanos Vol 2 12}} Nebula was left behind in the God Quarry. She fell victim to the Quarry's ensaring illusions, and didn't break free until after a considerable amount of time.

When Nebula escaped from the God Quarry, the trio of witches named [[Coven (Witches) (Earth-616)|The Coven]] that guarded it informed her that Thanos had met his end at the hands of Gamora. The Coven informed Nebual of the existence of the [[Naglfar Beacon]], a powerful weapon Nebula could use to one-up Gamora as the most dangerous woman alive.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 3}} Nebula kidnapped the [[Dwarves of Nidavellir|dwarf]] [[Urzuul (Earth-616)|Urzuul]] and forced him to build an axe with teleporting abilities and help her find the horn. The [[Asgardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Asgardians of the Galaxy]] assembled by [[Loki Laufeyson (Kid Loki) (Earth-616)|Kid Loki]] attempted to obtain the Naglfar Beacon for themselves, but they arrived too late.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 1}}

Nebula tested the horn, summoning the [[Naglfar Armada (Earth-616)|Naglfar Armada]] on [[Netredeen]] and then on [[Chandilar]].{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 2}} She moved to her true target, [[Earth]]. Expecting retaliation from the [[Asgard (Realm)|Asgard]] because the Naglfar Horn was Asgardian in nature, Nebula subdued and kidnapped [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] to use him as leverage.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 4}} She also captured Kid Loki, who had tried to warn Thor about Nebula's plans. The Asgardians of the Galaxy tracked Nebula down, and Loki incapacitated her using an illusion long enough for [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] to take the Naglfar Beacon from her. During the fight, Nebula's teleporting axe was damaged, and he had Urzuul repair it. The dwarf tempered with the axe, sending Nebula somewhere unpleasant when she used the axe to escape after her defeat.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 5}}

| Powers                  = '''Cybernetic Enhancements''': Having been rendered comatose by the revisitation of her traumatic past, Nebula had underwent deep seated neruobiological reconstructive surgery at the hand of [[Mandibus (Earth-616)|Dr. Mandibus]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #72}} These bionic upgrades give her incredible physical as well as technical supplementary enhancements beyond what she was capable of before.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #110}}
* '''Bionic Arm''': The robotics in her left arm provide Nebula with considerable offensory.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 #110}} Beyond just augmenting her physical strength it also doubles as a powerful energy caster with a dynatmistic projection device centered at the palm of the hand.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy: Best Story Ever Vol 1 #1}}{{r|Thanos Vol 2 #2}}
* '''Bionic Eye'''

'''Superhuman Strength:''' She possesses an ability to lift weights ranging 800lbs to 25 tons.

'''Superhuman Durability:''' Due to her superhuman strength she has possessed a very potent superhuman durability. Her muscular tissues are stronger than a human's.

'''Self-Sustenance''': Having lived through the trial placated by the Witches of Infinity, Nabula arose from it's petrifying imprisonment with godlike qualities similar to her grandfather Thanos. One of the facilities bestowed upon her was the capacity to survive in deep space while lacking the need of a space suit.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 3}}

'''Physical Enhancement''': After escaping the confines of the God Quarry Nebula's cybernetically enhanced constitution was considerably augmented. Now bearing the might of a god, she is able to take on a slew of divine and/or godlike entities with relative ease. Such as the [[Asgardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Asgardians of the Galaxy]] in single combat.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 5}}

'''Illusion Resistance''': Her time within the edge of the universe undergoing the Quarry's test had given Nebula an uncanny awareness of when she's being tricked by potent mirages.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 5}} Having easily seen through the trickery of Kid Loki's haze castings projecting onto her what it was she desired most. Her perception of the surreal is far from perfect however, as one illusion of a fatal interaction with her step-sister Gamora had left her near catatonic again. 

| Abilities               = Nebula is highly skilled in military strategy, space warfare, leadership, astro-navigation, and the operation of advanced technology. She is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter.
| Strength                = Her official Marvel Power grid rating is a 4, indicating that her strength is somewhere in the 800lbs to 25 tons range. Her ratings also indicate enhanced durability. After her trial within the God Quarry she would come out of it with deified physical straights. Making the pirate strong enough to confront and dispatch the physically superior Skurge of Asgard with relative ease.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 5}} 
| Weaknesses              = 

| Equipment               = 
| Transportation          = Among the advanced alien technology at her disposal was once Sanctuary II, a starship of 10,000 crewmen of various species and armed with hundreds of energy weapons as well as a hanger deck holding hundreds of fighter craft. Nebula also briefly controlled Sanctuary III until Thanos took it away from her.
| Weapons                 = Nebula wore wrist-mounted blasters that produced streams of either heat or concussive force. She often made use of a wide variety of alien weapons tech ranging from plasma guns to neural disruptors and even Kinitic-psion blaster which focuses emotional energy into concentrated laser emissions potent enough to temporarily stun the Silver Surfer.

| Notes                   = * Nebula was stated to have an "Universal" threat level by the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]].{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files #1}}
