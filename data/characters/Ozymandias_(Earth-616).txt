===Early Life===
Ozymandias originally was a warlord in Ancient [[Egypt]] under the service of [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Rama-Tut]].{{r|Rise of Apocalypse #1}} He kept plotting against Rama-Tut, who disposed him of his royal right to be pharaoh. In a moment of turmoil, he entered the Sphinx, which was actually Tut's time traveling ship, and seized the opportunity to unlock its secrets to dominate the nation.{{r|Rise of Apocalypse #2|3}}

However, [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] intercepted him and turned him into his slave. His body was altered and his mind overwhelmed by the recorded history contained in the memory banks. Although Rama-Tut fled, Ozymandias remained, now acting as a historian for En Sabah Nur. He has been a servant of Apocalypse since.{{r|Rise of Apocalypse #4}}

===19th Century===
Thousands of years later,Ozymandias was present when the [[Clan Akkaba (Earth-616)|Clan Akkaba]] resurrected Apocalypse to battle [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]] and his [[Vampire]] horde.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #3}} It was shown that he had been influencing [[Frederick Slade (Earth-616)|members]] of the Clan for his own ends for centuries.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #4}}

During her youth, [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Ororo Munroe]], who would become the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] member Storm in adulthood, was hired to steal Ozymandias's magical gemstone,the Opal of Ozymandias. When he recognized Ororo from his visions, he let her go with the Opal, knowing that Storm would eventually be instrumental in Apocalypse's plans for the powerful mutants known as the [[Twelve (Mutants) (Earth-616)|Twelve]].

Ozymandias was later discovered by the X-Men as they searched for [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #332}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 101}} As he battled the X-Men, he warned them of both Nur's return and the coming of [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 55}}

In [[Morocco]], Ozymandias carved a picture in the wall of tomb of Apocalypse showing Cyclops handing over Cable to the [[Askani]] and Archangel taking to the air. Ozymandias finished his drawing and wondered if the "dream" is being extinguished. Apocalypse stepped up behind him and told him, "It is done." Apocalypse says that humanity has reached its darkest hour and that his greatest enemy is nearing death. Apocalypse says that this is the best time to prepare for the dawn of his empire.{{r|Cable #34}}

While [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]] slept peacefully in his bed while surrounded by his toys and dolls. Ozymandias stood above him and told him that this will be Caliban's last night to sleep in the mansion before the storm comes. He told the the sleeping Caliban that he envies the friends that freed Caliban from Apocalypse's hold over him. He warns that Apocalypse does not give up his hold that easily, however and that when Caliban's pain is too much, he will return to Apocalypse.{{r|X-Force #67}} Caliban had been hiding out in the tunnels since the Zero Tolerance soldiers stormed the mansion. Caliban told him someone told him that he is not supposed to go. Then Ozymandias revealed himself as the one controlling Caliban. He puts Cable to sleep and told him that when he wakes he will think that Caliban is with a friend and is safe. Caliban then follows Ozymandias out of the tunnels to go back to Apocalypse.{{r|X-Force #70}}

...{{r|Gambit Vol 3 14}}

Ozymandias was present when Cyclops was merged with Apocalypse.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: The Search for Cyclops Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Men: The Search for Cyclops Vol 1 4|4]]}}
