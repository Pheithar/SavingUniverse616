===Origin===
[[File:Alpha Primitives from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Alpha Primitive]]
'''Alpha Primitives''' were created four thousand years ago by [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] geneticist [[Avadar (Earth-616)|Avadar]], who had convinced the governing [[Genetic Council (Earth-616)|Genetic Council]] of the need of a race of sub-human servants to free their species Inhumans of any physical work. Thus, Avadar reasoned, all the species could search for knowledge and illumination.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1}} 

Some Alpha Primitives are actually [[Homo sapiens|Humans]] who have gone through [[Xerogenesis]], this involved being exposed to the [[Xerogen Mist|mists]] of the [[Xerogen Crystals]] empowered by the [[Slave Engine]] which was previously created by the [[Kree]] to use against their human enemies.{{r|Mighty Avengers #27}}<!-- it isn't stated in the Alpha Primitives entry in Avengers Assemble that the Xerogenesis is the origin of the Alpha (in fact the two stories aren't combined in the entry) -->

===Service to Attilan===
In only a decade, the first five hundred Alpha Primitives were created. They began providing support to the city of [[Attilan]] in manufacturing, plumbing, drainage, food processing and more. They worked for eighteen hours a day, sleeping the other six, and having no need for culture or leisure.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1}} 

They understood human language in a similar way a six-year-old human child would. They had a life expectancy of forty-two years. Being non-sexual beings, their only chance for reproduction is through cloning. Due to this, all the Alpha Primitives are exactly equal.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1}}

Since then, and for all the successive millennia, the Alpha Primitives have been working without any complaint. Occasionally, some unethical Inhumans have performed illegal experiments on them, specially on the field of genetics.{{r|Fantastic Four #83}}

===Modern Era===
Over time the Alpha Primitives began to rebel against the Inhumans.{{r|Inhumans Special #1}}
[[File:Alpha Primitives from Fantastic Four Vol 1 47.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]
When the [[House of Agon (Earth-616)|Inhuman Royal Family]] returned to their homeland, the reigning king, [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]], learned of their arrival and unleashed the Alpha Primitives to combat them. [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] flew directly into the Primitives sending them scattering. After a brief battle, Maximus entered the chamber and apologized for the effrontery. He claimed that the Alpha Primitives had escaped on their own. Realizing that he could not hope to win out over Black Bolt's courageousness, Maximus handed the crown of leadership over to his brother.{{r|Fantastic Four #47}}
[[File:Alpha_Primitives_from_Fantastic_Four_Vol_1_82.jpg|thumb|right|350px]]
When [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]] brought the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] to Attilan an army of Alpha Primitives attacked them. It was revealed Maximus had taken over city and made the royal family his prisoners. The Fantastic Four fight off the Alpha Primitives and travel to find to confront Maximus.{{r|Fantastic Four #82}} The Royal Family escaped and fought a through Maximus' loyal Alpha Primitives to free Fantastic Four. Together Maximus was defeated and the Alpha Primitives returned to their duties.{{r|Fantastic Four #83}}

Maximus performed a second experiment with Alpha Primitives: using a device to siphon psychic energy, he attempted to give life to a synthetic giant body. The psychic energy Maximus harnessed was formed from the guilt modern Inhumans felt for having a slave species. The giant humanoid would become [[Omega (Android) (Earth-616)|Omega, the Ultimate Alpha]]. However, the Inhumans decided to end their "open war" against their own rebel workers, and Omega became lifeless again. Due to the "Omega Incident", the Inhumans decided to free the Alpha Primitives from service so that they could live as they wish on the sub-city under Attilan. Alpha Primitives were completely unfamiliar with leisure and freedom, and most of them continued with their previous task. Some Inhuman missionaries have gone to Alpha Primitive ghettos to instruct them.{{r|Fantastic Four #131|132}} 

[[File:Alpha_Primitives_from_Fantastic_Four_Vol_1_131.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]
Recently, [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]] performed an experiment including three Alpha Primitives and a great amount of mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]]. They become energy globes with a collective consciousness, known as the [[Trikon (Earth-616)|Trikon]]. The Trikon helped Maximus with his plan to get the crown of his brother, [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]], and then in exiling the rest of the [[House of Agon (Earth-616)|Royal Family of Inhumans]]. However, these beings were eventually defeated and banished to the [[Negative Zone]].{{r|Amazing Adventures Vol 2 9}}

===Freedom===
Before the wedding [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]] and [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] the Alpha Primitives rebelled against the Inhumans. They captured Crystal and took her to what appeared to be a revived Omega, but he revealed his true form as [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron-7]], who wanted revenge against the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Avengers #127}} He hoped to use them in his plans to destroy the Fantastic Four, Avengers and the Inhuman royal family. He failed and the Alpha Primitives were freed.{{r|Fantastic Four #150}}
[[File:Alpha Primitives from Fantastic Four Vol 1 240.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]
Due to the fact that the Alpha Primitives can't live alone, the previous arrangement was reversed by the time Attilan moved to the [[Blue Area of the Moon]].{{r|Fantastic Four #240}}

Currently the cloning of Alpha Primitives is strictly forbidden, which is reducing their number faster than many would have believed. As the Alpha Primitives are or have been a slave species for the Inhumans, the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] has repeatedly rejected the admission of Attilan to their member states.{{r|Avengers Annual #12}}

[[File:Himalayas from Avengers Vol 1 383 0001.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]
A number a Alpha Primitives were left in the [[Himalayas]]. struggling to get by just hunting, gathering and consuming. They encountered the [[Kree]]; [[Arides (Earth-616)|Shatterstar]] in his search for the Inhumans.{{r|Avengers #383}}

An Alpha Primitive [[RN-62 (Earth-616)|RN-62]] had been accidentally mutated by the [[Terrigen Mist]]. He used his newfound mutations to guard the mists and prevent the Inhumans from being further mutated.{{r|Avengers: Unplugged #6}}
[[File:Alpha Primitives from Avengers Unplugged Vol 1 6 page 15.png|thumb|right|200px]]
The Alpha Primitive; [[Alphan (Earth-616)|Alphan]] was a companion of the Inhuman Royal Family. When the [[Collector's Ship]] crashed in the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], Alphan was along [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]] and [[Timberius (Earth-616)|Timberius]] when they went to inspect the crash site, assuring that something was going to happen. As [[Ector (Brethren) (Earth-616)|Thane Ector]] was going to kill Quicksilver, Alphan opposed him, and was the one whose native blood was spilled for the Brethren's tradition.{{r|Avengers #334}}

Maximus took control of the Alpha Primitives again and planned again to use them for world domination, until Quicksilver grabbed  him and delivers him to the royal family. He used the Alpha Primitives to fight for him and they battled the royal family before Crystal used her position as their queen to retake control of them.{{r|Quicksilver #6}}

[[Reyno (Earth-616)|Reyno]] an Alpha Primitive ran away from [[Attilan]] fearing growing up to be just another primitive. He ran with his friend and lover, [[Alecto Petragon (Earth-616)|Alecto]].{{r|4 #19|20}}

The remaining Alpha Primitives live quietly in their preserve where many of them many still mindlessly performing the jobs for which they were trained. At one point, [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Karnak]] and [[Gorgon Petragon (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] were revealed and punished for advocating the continued use of the Primitives as slaves.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 20}}

===Unspoken===
The [[Unspoken (Earth-616)|Unspoken]] later recovered by the Alpha Primitives, who cared for their fallen king. Realizing his mistake, the Unspoken plotted to return and reclaim his throne, cultivating the [[Xerogen Crystals]], only for Attilan to rise into the sky. Cheated of his redemption and later learning of the Silent War between the Inhumans and United States of America, the Unspoken decided to change his plans and conquer Earth, unearthing the Slave Engine and planned on transforming all humans on the planet into Alpha Primitives.{{r|Mighty Avengers #27|31}}

===[[Realm of Kings]]===
The Alpha Primitives revolted again. Ronan stepped in to defend his wife Crystal, but she proved that she can take care of herself. Quicksilver created a huge whirlwind, blowing all the Alpha Primitives away.{{r|Realm of Kings: Inhumans #1|3}}

They were brought their by [[Lockjaw (Earth-17628)|Lockjaw]], but when they arrived they learned the Inhumans have come down with the "[[Terrigen Plague]]" that causes Terrigen Crystals to start growing from their body. The Alpha Primitives were also shown to be fully crystallized yet still alive. During this time, [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-17628)|Maximus the Mad]] had apparently made a cure for the plague while also putting [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-17628)|Black Bolt]] under his [[mind control]]. When [[Ronan (Earth-17628)|Ronan the Accuser]] arrived, Maximus swore the Inhumans allegiance to the [[Kree]]. Ronan went back on their deal and decided to destroy Attilan. Upon confiscating the mind control helmet, Ronan then had Black Bolt order Lockjaw to teleport him and [[Peter Quill (Earth-17628)|Star-Lord]] to the Terrigen Crystal caverns underneath to destroy Attilan from below. Upon Star-Lord using the Crypto Cube to undo the plague on the Inhumans and the Alpha Primitives, Black Bolt flew into space and used his voice to cripple Ronan's ship.{{r|Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy (animated series) Season 1 12}}

In [[Earth-199999]], the Primitives are members of the [[Watchdogs (Earth-199999)|Watchdogs]] who were turned into [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] by [[Holden Radcliffe (Earth-199999)|Dr. Holden Radcliffe]]. Their creation is the result of a compound where it's ingredients consist of some Terrigen Crystals, blood from a Kree Reaper and [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-199999)|Daisy Johnson]], and [[Hive (Earth-199999)|Hive]]'s own parasitic organisms.{{r|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 3 20}} Later, several [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-199999)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents became Primitives as well due to an explosive planted on confiscated items by [[R. Giyera (Earth-199999)|R. Giyera]] and [[James Taylor James (Earth-199999)|Hellfire]] on Hive's behalf.{{r|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 3 21}}
