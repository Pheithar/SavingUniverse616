| History                 = [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Captain Koenig was mandated by [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] to arrest another [[Skrull]] refugee group hiding in [[Palermo]], [[Italy]], along with two other agents and a containment unit.

Just before the strike, he was stopped by [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Director Brand]] to stand, waiting for his team to be enforced by [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], while [[Marcus Milton (Earth-13034)|Hyperion]] and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] were ready to back them up.

Using a device who scrambled the aliens shape-shifting powers, they easily defeated and arrested them, all of them being civilian refugees who vainly tried to escape.{{r|Infinity Vol 1 1}}
