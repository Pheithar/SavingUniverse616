===Days of Future Past===
Rachel Anne Summers is the [[Homo superior|mutant]] daughter of [[Scott Summers (Earth-811)|Scott Summers]] and [[Jean Grey (Earth-811)|Phoenix (Jean Grey-Summers)]] in [[Earth-811]], the "Days of Future Past". According to Rachel, Jean Grey from her reality mirrored the [[Earth-616|modern era]] [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], but when this Jean was captured by [[Sentinels]] and piloted a spacecraft back to [[Earth]], the [[Phoenix Force|Phoenix Force]] bonded with her, instead of placing her in a cocoon and replacing her. Another notable difference was when Jean/Phoenix returned to the home of her parents and, driven by Dark Phoenix's rage, demonstrated her powers in front of them, her father realized that, as a [[Telepathy|telepath]], Jean could feel the subconscious fear that her parents and sister felt in her presence and, realizing that this was causing her pain that she could not block out, chose not to cast her out, as she did in the modern era. As a result, Phoenix did not commit suicide after the [[Shi'ar Empire|Shi'ar]] duel of honor (as she had in the modern era). Instead, Jean married Scott and had a single child, whom they named Rachel Anne Summers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #199}}

Being born from the Phoenix Force merging with Jean, Rachel inherited both her mother's potential for [[Telepathy|telepathic]] and [[Telekinesis|telekinetic]] powers and the ability to tap into the limitless power of the Phoenix Force. Raised at [[Charles Xavier (Earth-811)|Professor Charles Xavier's]] [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|School for Gifted Youngsters]], Rachel met and befriended fellow mutant [[Franklin Richards (Earth-811)|Franklin Richards]], the son of Fantastic Four members, Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman. When her powers manifested, Rachel joined the [[New Mutants (Earth-811)|New Mutants]], a younger generation of [[X-Men (Earth-811)|X-Men]] brought together to carry-on Professor Xavier's dream of a peaceful co-existence between humans and mutants.{{r|New Mutants Annual #6}}

In the [[Earth-616|mainstream reality]], the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] prevented the assassination of anti-mutant [[Robert Kelly (Earth-616)|Senator Robert Kelly]]; however, in Rachel’s timeline, Senator Kelly was killed. The assassination caused intense widespread public paranoia against mutants, and, in the next presidential election, an anti-mutant candidate won. Around this time, Rachel's mother was killed in a nuclear explosion in Pittsburg reportedly caused by the X-Men's old enemy, [[Jason Wyngarde|Mastermind]]. The anti-mutant outrage led to a genetic purity act, rendering the X-Men fugitives. The Mutant Registration Act further resulted in a dystopian future as the mutant hunting [[Sentinels (Earth-811)|Sentinel]] robots, unleashed by the anti-mutant president’s administration to contain and eliminate mutantkind, decided that the best way to do so was to take over the [[United States]]. Over the subsequent years, they killed or imprisoned virtually all known superhuman beings within [[North America]], including Rachel's father.{{r|X-Men #141}}

===Hound===
One day, while Rachel was still a child, the X-Men's base of operations, at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, was attacked and demolished by federal troops. One of the only survivors at the school was Rachel, whom the soldiers found by the side of Prof. Xavier's body. The soldiers used drugs to neutralize Rachel's developing psionic powers, before she was tortured and brainwashed in the laboratory of the sadistic [[Roderick Campbell (Earth-811)|Ahab]]. Following extensive behavior modification, Rachel became a mutant "hound", using her psionic powers to hunt down other mutants for the authorities. Rachel's superiors branded her face with a grotesque, irremovable pattern of tattoos to mark her as a [[Hounds (Earth-811)|Hound]] and forced her to wear a leash. Rachel occasionally killed mutants herself and it is known that some of those were people she loved. Rachel's grief and shame at what she was forced to do as a hound and her anguish over the deaths of her parents and friends deeply scarred her soul, leaving her bitter and intolerant toward humans who persecute mutants. During one sadistic torture session imposed on her by Ahab, the pain helped Rachel break her brainwashing, letting her rebel and attack, Ahab, permanently scarring his face.{{r|Excalibur #52}}

===South Bronx Mutant Internment Center===
No longer of use as a hound, Rachel was placed in the [[South Bronx Mutant Containment Facility]], where she rejoined the surviving members of the X-Men in a plan to end the Sentinels' reign by changing history. There, Rachel befriended [[James Howlett (Earth-811)|Wolverine]], [[Erik Lehnsherr (Earth-811)|Magneto]], [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-811)|Katherine "Kate" Pryde]], and the adult Franklin, who later became her lover. Within the camp, Rachel and Franklin found a way to break their power-neutralizing collars.{{r|X-Men #141}}

===Changing the Past===
Rachel used her psionic powers to exchange the consciousness and spirit of the adult X-Man Kate with that of Pryde's [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|teenage self]], as she existed at a time just before the attempt on Kelly's life. It was hoped that the adult Kate, in her younger self's body at that earlier time, could warn the X-Men about the assassination attempt, so they could stop it, thereby preventing the chain of events from occurring that led to the Sentinels' rule. However, history could not be changed in this manner and Rachel, as it turned out, actually caused Kate to exchange psyches not with her younger self in the past of her own reality, but in the mainstream reality. While Kate was sent back to take over the body of her teenaged self, the other X-Men escaped the camp, taking Kate's unconscious body with them. Kate succeeded in preventing Kelly's assassination in the mainstream reality, after which the Pryde’s psyches returned to their proper times and realities. On her return, Kate found that other X-Men, except for Rachel, had all died in an attack on the Sentinels' [[Manhattan]] headquarters.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #142}}

===Phoenix Force===
Investigating why their efforts did not succeed in changing her reality, Rachel sent her astral self into that past as well, also arriving in the mainstream reality, subsequently learning Kate had crossed timestreams. While floating above [[New York City]], in preparation for her return, Rachel's meditative astral form was found by the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]], a powerful cosmic force that had been linked to Jean of the mainstream reality. Fascinated by Rachel, the alternate reality child of Grey and the Force itself, the Force read her mind and was impressed that Rachel had not given into despair after all she had experienced. Sending a portion of itself in the future of Rachel's reality with Rachel, the Force met Kate, after Rachel passed-out from the strain of the time travel.{{r|Excalibur #52}}

Kate bargained with the Force to save Rachel from the Sentinels' rule and to keep her from remembering the horrors she had experienced. The Force agreed to boost Rachel's powers, so she could physically travel back in time, not just psychically. Kate still did not give up her vain hope of altering her reality's history. Kate hypnotized Rachel into using her psionic powers to tap into the Phoenix Force and send herself back in time when Kate said the words "Dark Phoenix". Thus, Kate hoped that Rachel herself could change history. The next day, Rachel and Kate illegally entered the laboratory of Project Nimrod, which was the attempt to construct the most highly advanced Sentinel possible with the technology of that time, in the hopes of sabotaging the project. Kate planted a nuclear device, hoping to fool the regime into thinking Rachel had died, but the [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] prototype attacked Kate moments before the bomb detonated. Kate survived, due to phasing, but she suffered terminal radiation poisoning. Pursued by guards, Rachel and Kate locked themselves within the laboratory, whose walls were proofed against Kate's mutant power to phase through solid matter. Rachel believed herself and Kate to be trapped, but Kate said the words that caused Rachel to project herself back through time. Project Nimrod's creation, the Sentinel Nimrod, then fired on Kate and traveled back in time to find Rachel.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #199}}{{r|Excalibur #52}} According to the Force in the future Rachel came from Jean never became the Phoenix and died when Mastermind detonated a nuclear device in Pittsburg and it was this event, not the assassination of Senator Kelly, that resulted in the future Rachel was born in, though why Kate said Xavier was assassinated in Washington the same day Kelly was by the Brotherhood of Mutants rather then years later at his mansion at the hands of US troops was never explained.{{r|Excalibur #52}}

===Rachel in the Present===
Rachel found herself physically transported, body and mind, to a time shortly before the present, but, like Kate's spirit, Rachel had traveled not to the past of her reality, but to the past of the mainstream reality. Rachel went to [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Prof. Xavier]]'s [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|mansion]], but could not bring herself to stay, on realizing that she had come back to the wrong reality, and fled without identifying herself. Pursued by the psychic vampire [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]], Rachel stumbled into a nearby nightclub, where she was in the process of being thrown out by the bouncer, when the club's owner, Nicholas "Nick" Damiano intervened. Seeing her distress, Nick took Rachel back to his apartment and generously offered his assistance to her. Shortly after, while taking a bubble bath in his bathroom, Rachel sensed something was amiss when she was suddenly unable to sense his thoughts. She found him in his dining room, where he had made dinner for the two of them and was horrified to find him dead--his life-force drained from him by Selene. Rachel fought the psychic vampire, but was ultimately rescued by the timely arrival of the X-Men. After Prof. Xavier read her mind, Rachel was invited to the school. In the School for Gifted Youngsters, Rachel was tutored by Professor X and trained in the use of her powers in the [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger Room]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #184|188}}

===X-Men===
Later while out with [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Amara Aquilla]], Rachel sensed Selene and the pair decided to attack her and were defeated, then rescued by the X-Men. Later, Rachel overheard [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] state that Jean had also died in that reality. Rachel next battled [[Kulan Gath (Impostor) (Earth-616)|Kulan Gath]] with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and X-Men and after most of the heroes perished, [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]] traveled back in time to before it happened, erasing the event. Rachel tagged along as the X-Men next battled [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Thunderbird]], brother to the original [[John Proudstar (Earth-616)|Thunderbird]] who blamed Prof. Xavier for his death, and the [[Hellions (Earth-616)|Hellions]] to rescue [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]]. To rescue Banshee, the X-Men had to infiltrate the NORAD, North American Aerospace Defense Command, and were officially outlawed. Rachel was with the X-Men later, when they were caught on camera battling the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] and Nimrod. After siding with the Juggernaut, it appeared to the public that the X-Men were aiding a felon. Rachel then went on to rescue the [[Power Pack (Earth-616)|Power Pack]] from the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] and battled the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #189|196}}

Rachel later battled the [[Gladiators (Earth-616)|Gladiators]] to rescue the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]], [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] and [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]], from their old teammate, [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]]. While fighting the Gladiators, the Beyonder brought out Magik's dark half, the Darkchylde. [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Illyana Rasputin]] teleported her friends to [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]] and attacked them, until [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] used Illyana's [[Soulsword]] on her and returned her to her natural form.{{r|New Mutants #29|31}}
[[File:Rachel Summers (Earth-811) and Phoenix Force (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 199 0001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Rachel claims her "birthright"]]

===Phoenix===
Rachel was still shocked to learn of the supposed "death" of Jean in this reality and visited the [[Grey Family Residence|home of Grey's parents]] while they were absent, where she found a holo-empathic crystal that was imbued with an imprint of Grey's personality. Unaware that Jean had not actually been Phoenix, Rachel refused to believe that Jean could be evil, as people claimed Phoenix was, and she decided to claim the name and power of Phoenix as her own birthright. Through her own actions, Rachel sought to redeem the name Phoenix in this reality. Rachel also believed that as the new Phoenix, she could use her power to help her fellow mutants and, thereby, atone for what she had done as a hound in her own reality. Sensing this, the Force awoke within Rachel, allowing access to its power. It was at this moment, while holding the crystal, that Rachel first manifested about her the bird-shaped aura of energy associated with the previous Phoenix. From that time on, Rachel was able to draw to a limited extent upon the vast power of the [[Abstract Entities|cosmic entity]] known as the Phoenix Force. The [[glossary:A#Alien|alien]] being known as the Beyonder once hinted that Rachel could potentially become equal in power to the previous Phoenix. Now calling herself Phoenix, Rachel joined the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #199}}

After sensing [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Scott Summers (Cyclops)]] of the mainstream reality was in danger, Rachel met him and did not tell him of her true origins, while stopping a scheme of [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]]'s.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 9}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 199}} Later, [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] joined the X-Men, per Prof. Xavier's request, and he, completely out of character, stopped Rachel from killing a human that shot at her, stating that she would only prove them right that mutants are murderers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 200}} At this time, the Beyonder brought a young mutant, named [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom-Boom]], to the mansion and the X-Men and New Mutants instinctively attacked them.{{r|Secret Wars II Vol 1 5}} After showing her new uniform of the Phoenix to her teammates, upsetting Cyclops, the X-Men later traveled to [[Asgard]] to rescue [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] and the New Mutants from one of Loki's schemes and battled [[Fenris (Earth-616)|Fenris]]. After defeating Fenris, Rachel met her alternate reality, infant, half-brother, [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Nathan Christopher Charles Summers]], and created a psi-bond with him, promising to protect him and always be there for him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 201}} Rachel later took it upon herself to rid the universe of the threat of the Beyonder. After approaching him, he granted Rachel the full power that the previous Phoenix had possessed and gave her the choice to kill him or save the X-Men, after he had put them all in life-or-death situations. After saving them all, Rachel explained that knowledge and maturity must be won and deserved and left to rebuild [[San Francisco]]. Later, Rachel decided to simply destroy the entire universe and have it all start over without the Beyonder, by stealing the life force of the X-Men and [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]], but Storm's soul convinced her otherwise, after hearing the thoughts of every living being in existence, and Rachel returned the X-Men and Starjammers to life and the Beyonder reclaimed the power shortly thereafter. While staying with [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Jessica Drew]], the X-Men were beaten by [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]] and about to be taken in, until the intervention of [[Sabrina Morrel (Earth-616)|Officer Bree Morrell]], so the X-Men returned to [[New York (State)|New York]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 202|203}}{{r|Secret Wars II Vol 1 8|9}}

Returning home, Rachel attempted to telekinetically heal her teammate, [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], and opened her mind to his. However, because she no longer possessed the enhanced power the Beyonder had given her, she inadvertently worsened his condition. This, along with a great deal of hostility and animosity from the other X-Men for taking their life-forces without their consent caused Rachel to flee the Morlock tunnels in anguish. Soon after, Rachel found herself in front of the ruins of Nick Damiano's apartment, but she had found herself unable to remember his name. Frustrated by this and enraged with Selene, she decided to kill for her attack when she first arrived in the mainstream timeline and for murdering Nick. Rachel sought out [[Friedrich von Roehm (Earth-616)|Friedrich von Roehm]], Selene's aide-de-camp, and used her telepathy to force him to help her gain entrance to the Hellfire Club mansion, where she assaulted and quickly overpowered Selene. Wolverine, mentally sensing Rachel's intentions, tracked her to the mansion and stabbed her in the chest to prevent her from vengefully murdering Selene. Nearing death and fleeing to heal herself, Rachel was pursued by the X-Men, the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]], and Nimrod. While the others battled each other, Rachel was fooled by the six-armed sorceress [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]] and taken to the alternate dimension of [[Mojoverse]], where she was held prisoner for several months.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 207|209}}

===Excalibur===
After being enslaved as a hit television show by [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]], Rachel eventually escaped to [[London (England)|London]], where she was tracked by [[Warwolves]]. Rachel was captured by [[Gatecrasher (Earth-TRN295)|Gatecrasher]] and the [[Technet (Multiverse)|Technet]], who were hired by [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Saturnyne]] to eliminate Rachel as a threat to the entire universe. The combined efforts of Rachel, [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]], Nightcrawler, [[Meggan Puceanu (Earth-616)|Meggan Puceanu]], and [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]] resulted in their escape and the defeat of the Technet and the Warwolves. After learning that the X-Men had all died, Rachel suggested that the group stay together to continue Professor Xavier and [[Arthur Pendragon (Earth-616)|King Arthur]]'s dreams of equality and together they formed the British super-team [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]].{{r|Excalibur Special Edition Vol 1 1}}

After rescuing hostages in a nightclub, Rachel was introduced to [[Nigel Frobisher (Earth-616)|Nigel Frobisher]], who unsuccessfully attempted to ask her out. Rachel met Nigel again and, after she read his mind and realized his sleazy intentions, telekinetically pushed him away. Later, Rachel attempted to rescue Shadowcat, who was posing as Rachel, from her plan to find the remaining Warwolves, but Kitty was captured.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 1}} After saving people from a subway train, Rachel felt Shadowcat being skinned by the Warwolves and held her consciousness together, while tracking her to the Warwolves' hide-out. Excalibur rescued Shadowcat, who's intangibility saved her life, and placed the Warwolves on display at the zoo.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 2}}

The team moved into their new headquarters, Captain Britain's [[Braddock Lighthouse]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 3}} Following a trail of counterfeit money, Excalibur traveled to [[Murderworld]] and battled the [[Crazy Gang (Earth-616)|Crazy Gang]], to rescue Captain Britain's ex girlfriend, [[Courtney Ross (Earth-616)|Courtney Ross]]. While battling the Crazy Gang, Rachel felt her baby brother cry-out for help, due to the [[Inferno (Event)|Inferno]] and the demon, [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'Astrih]]'s attempt to sacrifice him, and Excalibur's bodies were switched with members of the Crazy Gang, except Rachel who, somehow, merged with [[Executioner (Crazy Gang) (Earth-616)|Executioner]]. After Kitty entered a virus into the Murderworld computers and sent [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] into Murderworld, Kitty phased into Rachel, allowing Rachel's telepathy to reassert her control.{{r|{{cl|Excalibur Vol 1 4}}-[[Excalibur Vol 1 5|5]]}}

[[File:Rachel Summers (Earth-811) and Phoenix Force (Earth-616) from Excalibur Vol 1 6 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Rachel sensing her brother in trouble]]
Sensing another distress call from her brother, due to his mother's attempt to sacrifice him, Rachel left for the [[Empire State Building]]. Upon arriving, Rachel confronted the [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Goblin Queen]], whom she mistook for her mother. Rachel was changed by the magic of the demonic invasion, becoming a mannequin.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 6}} The demon [[Crotus (Earth-616)|Crotus]], servant to N'astirh, sensed the Phoenix Force within her, and hoped to marry Rachel, in order to bind the power of the Phoenix Force to his will, but the ceremony was prevented by Nightcrawler, and Rachel returned herself to normal. Shadowcat had acquired Illyana's Soulsword and eldritch armor, and Kitty battled Meggan, now calling herself the Goblin Princess, until the Goblin Princess returned her to normal.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 7}}

After the demonic invasion, Rachel went to visit her brother on [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]'s [[Celestials|Celestial]] [[Prosh (Earth-616)|Ship]], where she learned that Jean was still alive. Not wanting to alert Jean to her presence, Rachel sat on a cloud and entertained baby Nathan, then flew off before Jean could notice her.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 8}} After briefly returning to the School for Gifted Youngsters, Excalibur returned home to rescue [[Weird Happenings Organization (Earth-616)|W.H.O.]] from the [[Lightning Force (Earth-597)|Lightning Force]], [[Earth-597|alternate reality]] [[Nazi]] versions of themselves, then negotiated the return of [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Dr. Moira Mactaggert]]. During the battle, Rachel was shocked to see there was no alternate reality version of herself in the Lightning Force.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 10}} Upon returning to the Lighthouse, Rachel and Kitty found that the Soulsword had appeared, embedded in bedrock. Despite using the full extent of power permitted by the Phoenix Force, Rachel was unable to remove the sword, which she surmised only Kitty could remove. At this time, a competition grew between Rachel and Kitty over the affections of W.H.O. member [[Alistaire Stuart (Earth-616)|Alistaire Stuart]], whom Kitty had developed a crush on (though he ignored this crush), while he found himself attracted to Rachel. After returning to the exchange of Dr. MacTaggert and the Highland Flyer crew with the Lightning Force Reichsrail Train, [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-597)|Reichsminister MacTaggart]] threw a nuclear grenade, and [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-811)|Widget]] teleported Excalibur and Alistaire to [[Earth-1193|another dimension]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 11}}

===End of Time===
After many adventures with Excalibur, Rachel finally managed to return to the future she had come from. While she couldn't change her past, Phoenix and her teammates were able to change the directives of all the Sentinels of the era to preserve all life, thereby ending the genocide that had prevailed for years. On the return journey, Captain Britain was lost in the timestream and it was discovered that Rachel had to exchange places with him for him to return. Phoenix sacrificed herself to exile in the timestream, to save her teammate. There, Rachel diverged into two timelines. One Rachel became stranded in the [[Earth-4935|late 37th century]], 100 years after [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-4935)|Apocalypse]] conquered the world, and became [[Rachel Summers (Mother Askani) (Earth-811)|Mother Askani]], founder of the [[Clan Askani (Earth-4935)|Clan Askani]].{{Citation}}

[[File:Cable Vol 1 85.jpg|thumb|right|Rachel captured by Gaunt]]
[[Gaunt (Earth-29283)|Gaunt]], a cyborg prisoner from over two billion years in the [[Earth-29283|future]] who was imprisoned two billion years further into the future at [[Earth-805110|the end of time]] on the Borderline reality, located the other Rachel in the timestream and guided her to his domain, depowering her. After he enslaved Phoenix, Gaunt forced her to [[Telepathy|telepathically]] summon [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], the adult version of her alternate reality half-brother Nathan Christopher, for his freedom. The [[Dark Sisterhood (Earth-616)|Dark Sisterhood]] of the modern era did not want Cable to aid their enemy, the Mother Askani version of Rachel, and offered Gaunt his freedom to defeat Cable. To obey the Sisterhood and eager to face a worthy adversary, Gaunt battled Cable for Rachel's freedom. Gaunt easily outfought Cable, who only managed to land a single blow, but this blow ultimately won the fight, however, as Gaunt inadvertently absorbed Cable's more virulent form of the [[Techno-Organic Virus]]. After Phoenix distracted him, the virus completely incapacitated Gaunt with it's aggressive spread, with his systems unable to restore him for a millennium or more. Cable returned Rachel to the modern era with him. With her own timeline erased and having been abandoned by the Phoenix Force, Rachel decided to retire from the costumed adventuring life and began attending college.{{r|Cable #85|86}} Soon after, Rachel became embroiled in the Dark Sisterhood's attempted takeover of the [[United States of America|United States]]. Rachel aided Cable in defeating the Sisterhood and their leader, [[Fiona Knoblach (Earth-616)|Finality]], after which she returned to college. Cable promised he wouldn't tell anyone she was back.{{r|Cable #92|95}}

===Rejoining the X-Men===
Months later, Rachel was captured by the mutant predator [[Elias Bogan (Earth-616)|Elias Bogan]], who used her as his pet telepath, enslaving other mutants to do his bidding. After Bogan's defeat at the hands of the [[X-Treme X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Treme X-Men]] team, Rachel was freed from his telepathic control and rejoined the X-Men, taking the code name Marvel Girl to honor the memory of her mother.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 22|23}} She had also changed her last name to "Grey" becoming Rachel Grey,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 444}} possibly to express disapproval at her father's continued relationship with [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], though she and Emma had made a truce of sorts during one of the team's missions in [[Hong Kong]]. After [[House of M]] and [[Decimation]], when most of the world's mutants lost their powers, the government had Sentinels instituted at the X-Mansion to protect the mutants in case any enemies used this low point to attack. Though their intentions were good this time, it reminded Rachel too much of the previous timeline when Sentinels herded mutants into concentration camps.{{r|Uncanny X-Men 469|470}}

===Grey's End===
[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 468 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Rachel Summers marked with a Phoenix tattoo]]
Rachel spent some time with her grandparents, bonding with her grandfather. At a family reunion with all her relatives, a commando unit under the order of the [[Shi'ar]] attacked the party, killing everyone including Rachel's grandparents, in hopes of wiping out the Grey genome. Though unable to kill her, they were able to graft a death mark on her back that would allow them to find her wherever she went.

The only remaining member of the Grey family then left alive on [[Earth]] besides Rachel was Cable. Afterward, at the graves of the Grey family, Rachel vowed a terrible vengeance on the Shi'ar and was quoted as saying: "I'm not my mom. I'm not the Phoenix. I'm my own woman. And by the time I'm done...they'll wish I WERE the Phoenix."{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 466|468}}

===Starjammers===
While searching for Charles Xavier, Rachel's uncle [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]] forced her to unveil the truth about his dark past. She extracted [[Darwin (Armando Munoz)|Darwin]]'s sentience from his body, and Vulcan flew off to exact revenge on [[D'ken Neramani (Earth-616)|D'Ken]] and the [[Shi'ar Empire]].{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 6}} Rachel put her own vengeful urges aside and accompanied a small team, organized by Xavier, to pursue her uncle into Shi'ar space. Word reached a secret order of the government, that lineage of the [[Phoenix Force]] was heading in their direction. An assassin named [[Korvus Rook'shir (Earth-616)|Korvus]] was sent to eliminate Rachel, but when his [[Blade of the Phoenix|blade]] touched her, a portion of its power was transferred to her. The two also shared each other's memories and the power she absorbed slowly started influencing Rachel's behavior. She created a darker and more revealing uniform, pursued a romance with Korvus, and killed her opponents freely.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 475|485}}

The X-Men met up with Rachel's grandfather [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|Corsair]] and his crew, the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]], and the assembly battled the Shi'ar coup that Vulcan had aligned himself with. After Rachel witnessed Corsair seemingly killed, [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Lilandra]] sent more than half of the X-Men back to Earth. [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], and Rachel were left stranded in space. They joined the Starjammers and lead the resistance against the new Shi'ar Empire, now under the control of Vulcan and his wife [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 485|486}}

Havok, Lorna, and the other Starjammers were imprisoned by Vulcan; Rachel, Korvus, and Lilandra remained free. Rachel was able to telepathically extract the location of the prison from [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]]. Once there she held off Shi'ar forces and battled [[Hodinn (Praetorian) (Earth-616)|a Hodinn]], however in the middle of the battle her Phoenix fragment abandoned her, leaving her weakened.{{r|X-Men: Kingbreaker Vol 1 1|4}}

In the weeks that followed, Rachel discovered that a secret order of the Shi'ar Empire was responsible for the massacre of her mother's family. She had been having nightmares about that tragic day and also ended her relationship with Korvus. When a hostile alien race calling themselves the [[M'Kraan (Race)|Scy'ar Tal]] ("Death to the Shi'ar") destroyed a Shi'ar inhabited planet known as [[Feather's Edge]], Vulcan called a cease fire with the Starjammers. Rachel was strongly against it and was then introduced to Chancellor [[Araki (Earth-616)|Araki]]'s bodyguards, who turned out to be the [[Shi'ar Death Commandos (Earth-616)|Shi'ar Death Commandos]], the very assassins physically responsible for wiping out most of the Greys. She was restrained by Polaris, but vowed vengeance upon them.{{Citation}}

Rachel assisted the unlikely team-up in preventing the Scy'ar Tal from exacting their plan of genocide. Unfortunately when Vulcan gained the upper-hand he turned the Scy’ar Tal’s own weapon against them. Rachel fought Gladiator to a standstill until Korvus was struck by a converted resistance member, [[Ka'ardum (Earth-616)|General Ka'ardum]]. She took his unconscious body and flew from the scene, just as Vulcan wiped out the entire Scy'ar Tal fleet and the area surrounding the [[M'kraan Crystal]]. While with the Starjammers, in battle with Vulcan's new guard, the fragment of the "blue" Phoenix within her and Korvus' blade mysteriously left them, and the "hound" markings reappeared on Rachel's face.{{Citation}}

In an agreement with the [[Inhumans (Earth-616)|Inhumans]], she along with the other Starjammers and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] assaulted a Shi'ar vessel in order to free Lilandra, hoping to end the conflict while restoring her to the throne. Even without her Phoenix powers she was powerful enough to entrap Gladiator in a illusion in order to keep him distracted from battle. Their gambit payed off and the group was able to free Lilandra.{{Citation}}

Rachel served as Lilandra's bodyguard along with the rest of the Starjammers. On the [[Chandilar|home planet of the Shi'ar]], Lilandra assumed her throne, but while making a ceremonial gesture, was killed by the possessed [[Christopher Powell (Earth-616)|Darkhawk]]. The only person who perceived this was Rachel, since Darkhawk was shielded from the perceptions of others. After Lilandra was assassinated, Rachel fought alongside the Starjammers against the [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Shi'ar Guard]] and Araki, who had summoned the same Shi'ar commandos that killed Rachel's family and branded her with the Shi'ar death mark. Rachel used her powers to implode [[Black Cloak (Earth-616)|Black Cloak]]'s head, saying "He was the one... He killed my family," though killing him didn't make her feel happier. She along with the rest of the Starjammers regrouped later and mourned the Shi'ar as they doubted that they would recover from the war.{{Citation}}

===Age of X===
After the events of the [[Age of X]], [[Rachel Summers (Earth-11326)|Revenant]] told Scott Summers that she was actually a mental manifestation of Rachel Summers, who was still in deep space.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #248}} Scott promised her that they would return her home.{{Citation}}

===Five Miles South of the Universe===
Attempting to get home, Rachel, Havok, and Polaris answered a distress call, only to find themselves trapped on [[Gul Damar Station]] caught in a rebellion against the Shi'ar by the [[Grad Nan Holt]].

Rachel was knocked unconscious by a surprise attack by the Grad Nan Holt called [[Friendless (Earth-616)|Friendless]], but at the same time [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] was given a way to locate Rachel after reintegrating some of [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]]'s personalities, and teleported herself and a team of X-Men to Gul Damar. Rachel fought a series of psychic battles with Friendless, until she shared her power with Rogue and the two overwhelmed their opponent. Gul Damar Station was transported into the orbit of Earth, finally reuniting Rachel, Havok, and Polaris with their fellow X-Men on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]]. Once there, Rachel confided in Rogue that she thought Korvus should return to space, and he left with the [[Salvagers (Earth-616)|Salvagers]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 253|260}}

===[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]===
[[File:Rachel shows her memories.png|thumb|right|Rachel showing the Death Commandos massacre memories to D'Keth]]
Shortly before a conflict between the X-Men and the Avengers sparked, Rachel joined Logan as one of the numerous mutants that left Cyclops' side to start the [[Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}} During the subsequent conflict between heroes, Rachel was contacted by Cyclops who asked her to feed the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] false information about the whereabouts of [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]]. She agreed and sent the Avengers on wild goose chases across the world. She proceeded to leave the school to join the battle on the side of her fellow mutants against the Avengers. She later helped the X-Men search for Hope, but with Hope copying her telepathic abilities, Rachel was not able to locate her. Rachel then battled against Cyclops and the [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]] and helped both the Avengers and X-Men take him down.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 3|12}}

===X-Women===
After the Phoenix crisis, Rachel remained at the Jean Grey School. Rachel along with [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] interrogated [[Sublime (Earth-616)|John Sublime]] when he surrendered to the X-Men, during which [[Arkea (Earth-616)|Arkea]] took possession of [[Karima Shapandar (Earth-616)|Omega Sentinel]].{{r|X-Men Vol 4 1}} Rachel was upset with Storm's decision to have Karima killed to stop Arkea and questioned her leadership.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 4}} As another Arkea sample was revealed, Rachel argued with John Sublime. There were hints of a romance blossoming between the two. Accompanying her team to Japan where they planned to kill the rest of the Arkea samples, Rachel was quickly defeated by [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]].{{r|X-Men Vol 4 12}}

While investigating what seemed like an alien invasion, the team found Rachel's aunt: The [[Shi'ar]] [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]]. With [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]] and Psylocke's combined telepathy, they found out that Deathbird had been experimented on and was pregnant.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 18}} During this trip in space, Rachel confronted [[D'Keth (Earth-616)|D'Keth]], the Shi'ar responsible for her family's death.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 19}} Tempted to let D'Keth die at their enemies' hand,{{r|X-Men Vol 4 20}}{{r|X-Men Vol 4 22}} she eventually saved him, and asked by him how he could redeem himself, she showed her massacred family's memories instead.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 22}}

During the battle with Red Onslaught in an attempt to save Earth. Rachel was reverted to her Hound form by Dr. Doom and Scarlet Witch's spell.{{citation}}

===Spider-Man and the X-Men===
Rachel was distrusting of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]'s newly appointed position as Jean Grey School guidance counselor. Using her telepathy she sought to expose his secret identity only to lose that memory by being mind-wiped by [[Martha Johansson (Earth-616)|No-Girl]].{{r|{{cl|Spider-Man and the X-Men Vol 1 1}}-[[Spider-Man and the X-Men Vol 1 5|5]]}}

===Death of X===
After the death of Cyclops from the [[Terrigen Mist]], Rachel left the X-Men to travel to London and did everything in her power to stay away from the X-Men while mourning the deaths of the mutants dying from the Terrigen Mists. She was encountered by Magneto who convinced her to help his team after he showed her how little people cared about the deaths of the mutants and to save the future of mutantkind.{{r|Civil War II: X-Men Vol 1 3}} Thus, she helped Magneto assault New Attilan to kidnap [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses Cain]] because Magneto feared his predictions would be used negatively by the Inhumans against mutantkind. They decided to leave Ulysses in peace after he showed Magneto a possible future where mutants kill each other, and Rachel decided to leave soon after because Magneto proved to be too untrustworthy a leader.{{r|Civil War II: X-Men Vol 1 4}}

===IVX===
During [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|the war between Inhumans and X-Men]], numerous Inhuman civilians were trapped in [[Limbo (Otherplace)|Limbo]], the X-Men's then-current base of operations. When many of them turned out dead, Rachel helped [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] find the Inhuman civilians to protect them. Unbeknownst to Rachel, the murderer was among the X-Men's ranks, as [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|M]] was being secretly possessed by her brother [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 17}}

===[[ResurrXion]]===
In the aftermath of the war, Rachel was asked to rejoin the X-Men, assuming the identity of Prestige due to Kitty's request,{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 1}} in an attempt to help Rachel move on from her past. When the X-Men confronted a Sentinel named [[Alpha (Sentinel) (Earth-616)|Alpha]] which was vulnerable to psychic attacks, Prestige attacked it, though the backlash knocked her into a blackout. As her friends continued fighting Alpha to no avail, Rachel found herself confronted with apparitions of Franklin Richards, Jean Grey, Cyclops and even her past self, which helped Rachel realize she was afraid of tapping into her full potential. Prestige assumed the risks of embracing the purest expression of her power, and woke up. She attacked Alpha again, successfully neutralizing it this time. In the wake of the battle, Rachel discovered she had reached a further state of awareness.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 6}} During her blackout it was revealed she felt [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]]'s feelings for her and confronted him about this. They then became a couple.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 7}}

Rachel's boost in powers caused her to experience flashbacks of her days as a hound.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 21}} While fending off an attack from [[Negative Zone]] aliens, Prestige was gravely hurt and slip into a coma.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 16}} While comatose, Rachel's hound marks resurfaced.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 17}} She eventually woke up, and complemented her physical changes with a new costume that resembled the one she wore as a hound.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 21}} Not long afterwards, the supervillain [[Mesmero (Vincent) (Earth-616)|Mesmero]] revealed himself to Rachel as the cause of her changes, since he had been probing her mind progressively for months. In order to defeat the X-Men, Mesmero forced Rachel into a cognitive recreation of the future where she hunted down mutants;{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 31}} however, the time-displaced Cyclops managed to break Mesmero's influence.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 31}}

When Jean Grey was resurrected by the Phoenix Force in a pocket dimension and rescued by the X-Men, the first place she visited was the Xavier Institute in Central Park, and Rachel was waiting there for her. The reunited mother and daughter flew in the sky together, before being joined by [[Laura_Kinney_(Earth-616)|X-23]] and visiting New Attilan. That night, Rachel was psychically ambushed by [[Cassandra_Nova_Xavier_(Earth-616)|Cassandra Nova]] who took control of her to use as a weapon against Jean.{{r|X-Men: Red Annual Vol 1 1}}

Cassandra Nova later reactivated her control over Rachel, after Jean Grey led an assault that destroyed her [[Nano-Sentinels|sentinites]].{{r|X-Men: Red Vol 1 8}} Under Cassandra Nova's psychic control, Rachel battled Jean on Genosha, but held back by resisting Cassandra Nova. When Cassandra Nova turned on Rachel, Jean made a deal with Cassandra Nova to release Rachel. Rachel departed only at Jean's urging, and after punching Cassandra Nova.{{r|X-Men: Red Vol 1 9}}

===Extermination===
Ahab managed to return to the present day and converted most of the X-Men into Hounds with the help of brainwashed mutant twins, [[Maxime (Mutant) (Earth-TRN727)|Maxime]] and [[Manon (Mutant) (Earth-TRN727)|Manon]]. Rachel was one of the the X-Men that was brainwashed into defeating the X-Men.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 3}} After a [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|time-displaced Cable]] and the [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|time-displaced X-Men]] time-travelled to the twins' past to find a way to defeat them and divert [[Earth-TRN727|their future]], Rachel was freed from Ahab's influence, yet remained a Hound, and subsequently left the X-Men.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 5}} She was later captured by a younger Stryfe, who sought to use her to lure the Clan Askani to their deaths, before ultimately being freed by her alternate self, Mother Askani.{{r|X-Force Vol 5 6}}{{r|X-Force Vol 5 9}} After being set free, Rachel telepathically battled Stryfe and emerged victorious. She was about to kill him when the time-displaced Cable talked her out of it, claiming that Stryfe's mind had to be wiped of all of the previous encounters to keep the [[Glossary:Timestream|timeline]] intact. After this was done, Rachel travelled back to the [[Earth-616|past]] with Cable and the rest of [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]].{{r|X-Force Vol 5 10}}

Rachel is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] classified as a [[Mutant Classification#Omega Level Mutants|Omega Level Mutant]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men #208}} as well as the daughter of the [[Jean Grey (Earth-811)|Phoenix]]. Rachel inherited enormous psionic powers from her mother and has limited control over her powerful [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]]. Marvel Girl has developed an electric blue Phoenix emblem energy signature, which appears over her left eye whenever she uses her powers. According to [[Jat Vor-Thrul (Earth-616)|Jat Vor-Thrul]], Rachel measures a '''11-Tau-11 on the Kiatna Psi-Scale'''. She is one of the most powerful psychics in the entire Marvel Universe. Not only does this imply that there is a measurable scale for beings of her impressive power, but that people with such power are considered valuable, as the [[Salvagers (Earth-616)|Salvagers]] seemingly took her for profit.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #254}} After blacking out while fighting the Sentinel Alpha, Rachel tapped into her full potential.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 6}} In her own words, the dial had been cranked on all of her senses.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 21}}

*'''Telepathy & Empathy:''' Rachel is an Omega-Level telepath and possesses potent empathic capabilities, similar to her mother Jean Grey. She can read and detect emotions and thoughts on various scales, as well as project her thoughts into the minds of other sentient beings within a vast, potentially limitless radius. After fulling recognizing her true potential, she started reaching new levels of telepathic power, capable of interacting and perceiving minds from thousands of miles away with ease. Storm once stated that Rachel's telepathy had grown to such an extent to the point in which "her psionic powers radiated off of her, to the extent in which others could feel her powerful presence within their minds". {{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 31}} From years of training and telepathic tutelage, she has demonstrated the following specialized uses: 
** '''Telepathic Cloak:''' Can mask her presence from being detected by others. Her abilities can at times go undetected or be counteracted by other more powerful telepaths depending on their level of skill in using their own psi abilities. She can extend these defenses to others around her as well.
** '''Trauma Healing:''' The ability to heal mental trauma through "psychic surgery", the power to stimulate or deaden the pain and pleasure centers in a person's brain.
** '''Mind Control:''' Ability to control the minds of others upon mere concentration.
** '''Psionic Shield:''' Ability to erect a psychic shield for protection of herself and of others minds.
** '''Mind Transferal:''' The ability to transfer both her mind and powers into other host bodies should her own physical body somehow be destroyed.
** '''Neural Jumpstart:''' The ability to increase the speed of synapses in the brain, allowing her to increase another's powers to incredible levels, with a temporary effect.
** '''Telepathic Illusions:''' Ability to create illusions to make herself seem to be invisible, look like someone else, or make others experience events that are not truly happening.
** '''Mental Paralysis:''' Ability to induce temporary mental or physical paralysis.
** '''Mental Amnesia:''' Can erase any awareness of particular memories or cause total amnesia.
** '''Psionic Blasts:''' She can project psionic force bolts which have no physical effects but which can affect a victim's mind so as to cause the victim pain or unconsciousness and turning someone brain-dead.
** '''Astral Projection:''' Can project her astral form from her body onto astral planes or the physical planes. In the physical plane she can only travel in astral form over short distances. In the [[Astral Plane]], she can mentally create psionic objects and manipulate the aspects of her environment. She can communicate with others astrally through her own will, or through contact with the thoughts and memories of others.
** '''Mental Detection:''' Can sense the presence of another superhuman mutant within a small but as yet undefined radius of herself by perceiving the distinctive mental radiations emitted by such a being.
** '''Psychometry''' 

*'''Telekinesis:''' Rachel is a High-Level Telekinetic, meaning she has immense telekinetic powers. She can sense and manipulate matter and energy, quite possibly on a subatomic level. Rachel can use her telekinesis to affect and control molecules and particles, allowing her to fully control matter and energy for a variety of effects:
** '''Intuitive Aptitude:''' Can disassemble complex devices explosively (separating every last component, such as screws, nuts, circuit boards, etc.) and, just as quickly, easily assemble complex devices. This also has enabled her to even attain awareness and control over objects as small as individual electrons in an atom. For instance, Rachel could detect if a seal was hermetic or not by checking for the presence of penetrating oxygen molecules. Can even detect and discern individual oxygen molecules, and determine the atomic weight of molecules by the amount of atoms present.
** '''Matter Alteration:''' As Marvel Girl, has shown the ability to alter molecular and subatomic structures and the ability to alter molecular valances, or even rewrite her own genome.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #457|459}} Rachel has also been able to create a micro black hole.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #447}}
** '''Force Field Generation:''' Ability to create protective force shields that can deflect even the most powerful of attacks (even filter bacteria from the air, withstand Jovian atmospheric pressures, and even repel nuclear weapon attacks). The upper limits of this ability remain unknown. Rachel has also displayed such control over the fields as to shape them precisely, even to conform very closely to her body’s form. There does not appear to be any correlation between field strength and the thickness of the telekinetic fields.
** '''Concussive Blasts:''' Can project telekinetic energies as powerful blasts beams directed from her brain that could apparently affect matter with concussive force.
** '''Telekinetically Enhanced Condition:''' Rachel is capable of telekinetically enhancing her physical abilities to superhuman levels.
** '''Flight:''' By levitating herself, she can “fly” for very long distances and at supersonic rate.

*'''Time Manipulation:''' Possesses the psionic power to travel and manipulate time for a variety of effects, including: travel through time and space, stopping or greatly slowing down time in her immediate vicinity, etc.) Rachel can even send the awareness/consciousness/soul of herself or others to the past or future versions of herself, or possibly their ancestors/descendants.
** '''Chrono-Shield:''' The unconscious emanation of a fourth dimensional pulse which creates a chrono-shield protecting her from changes in the timeline.

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 199.jpg|thumb|left|Dark Phoenix?]]
'''Phoenix Force Avatar:''' For a time, Rachel was also bonded to the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] as "the one true Phoenix", and had its cosmic powers at her disposal. As Phoenix, Rachel's abilities are enhanced to their ultimate levels, limited only by her force of will and breadth of imagination. As Phoenix, she has manipulated matter on an atomic and universal scale, generated and controlled any form of energy in virtually any conceivable amount, absorbed energy from sources as great as a supernova, manipulated time and space, created space warps for instantaneous travel, and enhanced her strength to immeasurable levels. Rachel demonstrated heightened psi-powers as well as the ability to manipulate energy and lifeforces, and a limited cosmic awareness. Rachel's connection to the Phoenix power was lost in the distant future. Rachel's connection to the Phoenix power was lost in the distant future and did not return with her when she traveled back to the [[Earth-616|modern era]]. Recently, Marvel Girl absorbed a residual echo of the Phoenix Force left in the [[Blade of the Phoenix|sword]] of a previous host, a [[Shi'ar]] named [[Rook'shir (Earth-616)|Rook'shir]]. Its full effects are unknown at this time. It was revealed that the power Rachel has is not the true Phoenix Force, but a shadow or echo of it, it was easier to control, but less powerful. It has disappeared along with the sword.

| Abilities               = Rachel Summers has trained with [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] in hand-to-hand combat, learned lock-picking skills from [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], and has some experience in vehicular repair and the use of advanced weaponry and technology. She also on some occasions she has demonstrated to use her telepathy and telekinesis in her combat.
| Strength                = Normal human female with intensive regular exercise. When possessing the Phoenix Force, Rachel had superhuman strength with an unknown upper limit.
| Weaknesses              = Even with the powers of the Phoenix, magic and magical objects prove to be an enigma for Rachel's powers. When the [[Soulsword]] appeared near the [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] [[Braddock Lighthouse|lighthouse]] headquarters seeking [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]] to become its new wielder, Rachel attempted to remove it from the bedrock it had embedded itself into in order to alleviate her friend's apprehension. Despite using the full extent of power permitted by the Phoenix Force, Rachel was unable to remove the sword which she surmised only Kitty Pryde could remove. This could be the reason why Rachel has not telekinetically removed the Shi'ar deathmark on her back, although Nightcrawler theorized that this was only because Rachel didn't wish to remove it.

| Equipment               = 
| Transportation          = Flight and [[X-Men Blackbird]]; formerly [[Starjammer]]
| Weapons                 = 

| Notes                   = * There are some glaring inconsistencies in Rachel's history. For example in "Days of Future Past", Kate clearly states that [[Charles Xavier (Earth-811)|Professor Xavier]] was assassinated with Senator Kelly, but when Rachel went back in time, she clearly remembers Professor Xavier being killed by the [[United States Army (Earth-811)|U.S. Army]] years later, along with Nightcrawler,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #188}} who in fact escaped the massacre to be killed by her later.{{r|Excalibur #35}} And in {{cl|Excalibur Vol 1 21}}, she states that Professor X was killed by Hellfire Club soldiers.
* She apparently could not remove the death mark now grafted onto her back, but Nightcrawler theorized that this was only because Rachel didn't wish to remove it.{{r|Uncanny X-Men 469}}
| Trivia                  = * When [[D'Spayre (Earth-616)|D'Spayre]] fed on Rachel, her despair was classified as of "cosmic-level."{{r|Excalibur #35}}
