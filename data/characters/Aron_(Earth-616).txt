Aron was a relatively young member of the [[Watchers]], an alien race of immortal observers of the universe. When [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu]], the Watcher assigned to [[Earth]] (and incidentally Aron's uncle), was brought to the Watcher home-world for trial, Aron became intrigued by Uatu's break from the Watcher's traditional code of non-interference.{{r|Captain Marvel #39}} Initially hesitant, the elder Watchers allowed Uatu to mentor Aron while watching Earth. The rebel Watcher Uatu could be a better teacher for a rebel youngster than other, more conservative Watchers. Uatu instructed Aron on the non-interference and the passive observation.{{Citation}}

Excited about adventure, Aron attempted to interfere on behalf of the superhero team [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], while they were aiding the race of [[Inhumans]] who lived on the moon.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #21}}  Aron was prevented by Uatu. However, Aron decided that he wanted to live adventures, and the first step to do so was avoiding being noticed by the Watchers. He devised a means to do so, with a special uniform.{{Citation}}

Aron secretly traveled to Earth and found residence in [[Empire State Building]] from which he watched the Fantastic Four's activities.{{r|Fantastic Four #321}} Aron found out about the formation of a new version of the villain team the [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]]. Their leader, the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]], decided that they needed new members and sent an invitation for new, powerful members. Aron formed an alliance with the Frightful Four with the robot [[Draconus (Earth-616)|Dragon Man]] in tow, so that he could collect tissue samples from the Fantastic Four.{{r|Fantastic Four #328}} Although the Frightful Four were in the bad end of a fight against the Fantastic Four, Aron's timely arrival changed the tide: Aron defeated the Fantastic Four nearly single-handedly.{{r|Fantastic Four #327}}

The Wizard tried to order Aron to destroy the Fantastic Four, but Aron was not interested.{{r|Fantastic Four #328}} Aron took this opportunity to take cell samples from the unconscious Fantastic Four to make clones of them. Soon, the Fantastic Four were awake and defeated the Frightful Four, but Aron's clones were ready.{{Citation}}

Soon after, Aron replaced the Fantastic Four, Frightful Four, and the [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel (Sharon Ventura)]] with their respective clones, placing the others in suspended animation (The false Fantastic Four included the "spiky" version of the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] and the rocky version of Ms. Marvel).{{r|Fantastic Four #329}} With these pawns, Aron acted out his desires for adventure, allowing the clones to relive the real team's earliest adventures.{{Citation}}

But Aron also managed to spoil the Fantastic Four's reputation after they performed several acts against the public interest, because the clones were fanatic and lacking the mercy of the originals. Nobody suspected from the change, but the team managed to turn [[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Mole Man]] hostile again and tried to impose a ''Fantastitax'' of 50$ to every New Yorker.{{Citation}}

The superteam known as the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] investigated the Four's behavior, uncovered Aron, and released his captives, who defeated their counterparts. Aron allowed everyone to return to their respective places on Earth, and placed the clones in suspended animation before teleporting his entire facility to a cave on Jasper National Park, Canada.{{Citation}}

There, they discovered that the Fantastic Four and the Frightful Four had escaped and were fighting again, while Aron was frozen and helpless due to his own actions. Both teams of Fantastic Four believed to be the original and they fought, but the real Fantastic Four prevailed, and defeated the Frightful Four too.

Aron then revealed that he had never been really helpless. He teleported the Frightful Four to the [[Vault]] prison and the false Fantastic Four to his own headquarter, where they would be placed in suspended animation. Aron would analyze their dreams and get the excitement he longed. He then teleported all his base to an unrevealed location, probably still on Earth.{{Citation}}

At another time, the villain [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] managed to discover Aron, and siphoned a portion of Aron's cosmic energy for himself.{{r|Fantastic Four #373|375}}

In an attempt to regain it, Aron masqueraded as Uatu in order to manipulate the Fantastic Four to defeat Dr. Doom and have him relinquish his power. Once the elder Watchers learned of Aron's disobedience to the code of non-intervention, they brought him to the Watcher home-world to stand trial, but he managed to escape their grasp.{{r|Fantastic Four #388|392}}

Later Aron was involved in a scheme with an evil Reed Richards from another timeline who called himself the Dark Raider. Eventually Uatu converted Aron into energy into recreating The One after he was destroyed by the Celestials.{{r|Fantastic Four #397|400}}
