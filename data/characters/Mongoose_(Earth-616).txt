===Origin===
Mongoose started life as a normal Mongoose, but he was experimented on by the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] on [[Wundagore Mountain]]. He was uplifted into a group of sentient humanoid beings known as the [[New Men]], while retaining many of his animal traits. {{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 3 5}}

===Masters of Evil===
[[File:Mongoose from Thor Vol 1 391.jpg|left|thumb]]
Mongoose was smuggled out of [[Transia]] by the villainous [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] and his [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]]. He was apparently supposed to join the Masters of Evil on their assault on the [[Avengers Mansion]]. The Masters' [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]] and [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]], in disguise, were supposed to pick him up at the airport, but they became involved in a battle with the hero [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]]. Mongoose, now that he was in America, decided to forget about the Masters of Evil and set out on his own.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 283}}

===Thor===
Mongoose was next seen attacking the hero [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], who was at a construction site in his civilian identity of Sigurd Jarlson. Apparently the Mongoose had been hired by someone to kill Thor, for an unknown reason. The Mongoose, using his "cellsmograph," had tracked Thor down while he was in his secret identity. Spider-Man intervened, giving Jarlson enough time to get his hammer and turn into Thor. Spider-Man and Thor fought Mongoose to a stand still, but Mongoose escaped after creating a diversion. Mongoose broke the support beams holding up the building where they were fighting. Fearing for the lives of the construction workers on the building, Thor held up the building long enough for Spider-Man to fashion some temporary support to avoid collapse.{{r|Thor Vol 1 391}}

Quicksand and Mongoose agree to team up against Thor, since, according to Mongoose, the High Evolutionary is most interested in her.{{r|Thor Vol 1 402}} Thor battled Quicksand, but it's just a distraction. Mongoose and his shadowy partner activate a device which takes skin samples from Thor.{{r|Thor Vol 1 403}} Mongoose kidnaped Eric Masterson to draw Thor out. Thor senses the trouble through the bond he shares with Kevin’s toy hammer. Odin sends Thor to Earth through the Fantastic Four’s negative zone portal. When he arrives at Eric’s apartment, he is given one word to go on: "Wundagore".{{r|Thor Vol 1 405}}

Thor flew to Wundagore and easily defeated the [[Knights of Wundagore (Earth-616)|nights of Wundagore]]. [[Tagar (Earth-616)|Count Tagar]] was revealed as the mystery man that has been after Thor’s tissue samples. Mongoose has gone insane, but Count Tagar only wants to bring Hercules and the High Evolutionary back from the [[Black Galaxy]].{{r|Thor Vol 1 406}} They returned to Wundagore. The High Evolutionary told them they should leave because they are returning to study the Black Galaxy. Mongoose attacked and during the battle, Eric lifts [[Mjolnir]], but receives a fatal blast before he can strike.{{r|Thor Vol 1 408}}

===Thunderstrike===
[[File:Eric Masterson (Earth-616) and Mongoose (Earth-616) from Thunderstrike Vol 1 14 0001.jpg|left|thumb]]
Thunderstrike and [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] team up to try and track Bison themselves, only to run headlong into Bison, Quicksand, and Mongoose.{{r|Thunderstrike Vol 1 13}} Thunderstrike  blasted Mongoose with an intense light-burst, blinding him completely. Eric then began to beat him down, but when the floodwaters come, Mongoose jumps into the water claiming he'd rather drown then rot in prison.{{r|Thunderstrike Vol 1 14}}

Thunderstrike met Quicksand and Mongoose again and they promptly attacked him, only to be saved by [[Jackie Lukus (Earth-616)|Bloodaxe]]. Bloodaxe was about to kill Mongoose, when Thunderstrike intervened and saved his life. Mongoose was embarrassed, and, while enraged, begins attacking Thunderstrike while Quicksand and Bloodaxe face off. [[Code: Blue (Earth-616)|Code: Blue]] got the alert, and rolled out to break up the battle. Thunderstrike knocked out Mongoose, and Bloodaxe has used the axe to change Quicksand into glass.{{r|Thunderstrike Vol 1 22}}

===Thunderbolts===
He was recruited in to the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]]{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 104}}{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 107}}

The current location of Mongoose is unknown, though he is probably still somewhere in New York City.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 2 17}}

* The Mongoose, who at one point was an actual mongoose, possesses various superhuman attributes after undergoing genetic engineering experiments conducted by the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 14}}
** '''Superhuman Strength:''' The Mongoose possesses superhuman strength enabling him to lift about 10 tons.
** '''Superhuman Speed:''' The Mongoose can run and move at speeds that are far superior to that of even the finest human athlete. He has demonstrated sufficient speed to be able to run up the side of skyscrapers.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 14}}
** '''Superhuman Stamina:''' The Mongoose's musculature produces considerably less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of a human being, even the finest human athlete for that matter. He can physically exert himself at peak capacity for up to 24 hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to affect him.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 14}}
** '''Superhuman Durability:''' The Mongoose's body is tougher and more resistant to certain kinds of injury than the body of a human being. For instance, the tissues of his body, particularly his muscles and joints, are designed to withstand the rigors of running at high speeds without being damaged. The Mongoose can also withstand tremendous impact forces. He can withstand impacts that would severely injure or kill a human being, such as falling from a height of many stories or being struck by a superhumanly powerful opponent like [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] and sustain little to no injury.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 14}}
** '''Superhuman Agility:''' The Mongoose's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 14}}
** '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' The Mongoose's reflexes are similarly enhanced and are superior to those of the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 14}}

| Abilities               = The Mongoose is a formidable hand to hand combatant.
