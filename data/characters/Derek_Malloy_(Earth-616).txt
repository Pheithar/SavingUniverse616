Dr. Derek Malloy was the S.H.I.E.L.D. psychiatrist with whom [[Human Torch (Android) (Earth-616)|Jim Hammond]] discussed a mission regarding [[Ryoko Sabuki (Earth-616)|Radiance]].{{r|All-New Invaders Vol 1 6}}

After the session ended, Hammond confronted Derek about being an A.I., thinking that S.H.I.E.L.D. decided that it was better to have a fellow A.I. talk with Jim. Derek indeed revealed himself as an A.I., but an evil one who then attacked Hammond.{{r|All-New Invaders Vol 1 7}}

Malloy sprayed some kind of liquid at the Torch, which was combustible, and reacted with Hammond's flames creating an explosion which destroyed Malloy.{{r|All-New Invaders Vol 1 8}}
