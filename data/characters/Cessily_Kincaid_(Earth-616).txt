===Origin===
[[File:Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 34 0001.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Mercury's powers manifesting]]
Cessily lived a completely normal life and was a beloved only child, until her mutation developed. Her body changed into a metallic, mercury-like substance.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 34}} Her parents did not know how to deal with this change. While they did not reject her outright, they shipped her off to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]], hoping the neighbors would never know about their mutant daughter.{{r|New X-Men: Hellions Vol 1 1}}

===Xavier Institute and the Hellions===
Cessily eventually made her first friend at Xavier´s in resident bad boy [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]], who has been like an older brother to her ever since. When Cessily met [[Kevin Ford (Earth-616)|Wither]], who was an outcast at the school due to his death touch, she formed a crush on him, and eventually discovered she was immune to his powers. This forged a connection between them. She stood up for Wither and got Hellion to welcome him into their [[Hellions Squad (Earth-616)|Hellions]] clique and training squad.{{Citation}}

After the Hellions became the school's field day winners they went off to California to stay at Julian's house. They were stopped at the airport because of the appearance of Cessily and [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Santo]]. Cessily offered to travel as luggage because the TSA did not know how a girl made of metal could go through a metal detector. Once they eventually got on a plane Cessily confided with [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]] that her parents never treated her the same after her mutation and they made her "stay inside a lot, so they won't have to answer any questions." She believed they were relieved she wasn't going home right away.{{r|New X-Men: Hellions Vol 1 1}}

The Hellions met a mutant power broker called the [[Kingmaker (Wallace) (Earth-616)|Kingmaker]]. When granted one wish by Kingmaker, Cessily asked to have her parents accept her. She journeyed to [[Portland (Oregon)|Portland]] and found her parents as open and loving as before she got her powers.{{r|New X-Men: Hellions Vol 1 2}} When Cessily and the Hellions realized Kingmaker´s gift came with a price, they tricked him and backed out of the deal. It was only then that Cessily realized her parent's love had been forced - they had been mind-controlled. Free of Kingmaker's influence, the Kincaids blamed Cessily and disowned her.{{r|New X-Men: Hellions Vol 1 4}}

===M-day===
[[File:Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 30 0001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Mercury in battle]]

Soon thereafter, the events of [[Decimation|M-Day]] left only 27 students with their powers, Cessily included, though she would have preferred to lose her powers. The depowered students and staff were sent back to their homes.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 23}} One bus was bombed by anti-mutant religious zealot [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Reverend William Stryker]], and Cessily's former teammate and friend [[Brian Cruz (Earth-616)|Tag]] was among those killed. The [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] held a funeral for those students whose parents would not accept them, and Cessily's anguish was very visible.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 24}}

All of the remaining students were placed by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] into an all-out brawl, and the ones deemed to be the best were to be assigned to become a group of in-training [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]]. Cessily made the team and began training to become an X-Man.{{Citation}}

Cessily and the New X-Men defeated Stryker, [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]] killing him. Shortly afterwards the team went to help [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]] who had been sought out by [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] for repair. During the skirmish [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] was forced to sever a piece of Mercury's hand to separate her from Nimrod. She later commented she'd "always wanted to lose a few pounds."{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 33}} The team successfully defeated the robot due to a group effort. Nimrod was sent back in time.{{Citation}}

===Predator X and Limbo===
After learning of Emma Frost's plan to have X-23 leave the school, Cessily took Laura to [[Salem Center]] for coffee to cool Laura down. Just as Cessily realized that Laura had feelings for Hellion, the coffee shop exploded. [[Facility (Earth-616)|Facility]] agents led by Laura's former handler, [[Kimura (Earth-616)|Kimura]], came for one of them. Laura, believing it was her, begged Cessily to leave. Kimura shot Cessily with an electric bullet however, stopping Cessily from doing anything, and stating that they were actually there for Cessily.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 33}} After capturing Cessily, Kimura left before Laura could recuperate from a grenade blast.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 34}}

[[File:Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 38 0001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mercury in Limbo]]

At the lab, Cessily questioned who they were and what they wanted but was given no answers. When she replied that her friends would come for her, Kimura informed her that "The Elephant" ([[Maximus Jensen (Earth-616)|Mammomax]]) said the same thing, while showing a picture of his corpse in a cell.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 34}} Apparently before his death, Stryker had requested a living weapon, a huge beast called the "Predator X", and Mercury's metal skin was needed to give him more durability and powers. Gruesome experiments partly stripped the girl of the needed bio-metal, granting the beast her powers, and leaving her in extreme pain. The experiments left her physically and mentally traumatized, and she went into recovery at the institute upon her rescue.{{Citation}}

Mercury was recovering in bed when the students were teleported to [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]]. She was held captive by [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]], but broke free after he 'killed' X-23. She and [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]] went up against Belaco and kept getting beaten down but refused to give up, as both their mutant bodies were resistant to his magic.{{Citation}}

===World War Hulk===
During World War Hulk, Mercury teamed up with her fellow New X-Men to face the Hulk when he came to capture Xavier for his involvement in the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] {{r|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 1}}. As their initial attacks failed, Mercury attacked him in a last ditch attempt, but Hulk threw her through a window into the graveyard of deceased mutants who died on M-Day, with Xavier running after her and Hulk following suit. When the Hulk heard about what happened to them, he realized that his anger was wrongly directed at Xavier and left {{r|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 3}}.

Mercury had also been deeply affected by the events of Decimation.<ref>depicted in the "Endangered Species" miniseries</ref> She was distraught by the death of a teenage civilian mutant and was one of the students at the institute trying to determine the youngest mutant, as she believed that the youngest mutant always tends to be killed.{{Citation}}

===Messiah Complex===
Mercury was one of the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]] led by [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]] that launched a strike against the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] to incapacitate them and rescue the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|mutant baby]]. After Hellion was critically wounded by [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]], [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] panicked and blindly teleported the entire team out of the Purifiers' base, spreading them out between Washington and New York. Cessily appeared not to suffer any lasting injuries as a result. She helped to stabilize Hellion in the [[X-Men Blackbird]] on the way back to the mansion. Later, she went with Dust and [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]] to visit the graveyard, and they discovered that [[Predator X]] had entered the mansion grounds. Mercury battled the monster with the rest of the students and was transported by Pixie, along with the other New X-Men, to the battle between the X-Teams and [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]]'s forces on [[Muir Island]].{{Citation}}

===San Francisco===
Mercury joined the X-Men in [[San Francisco]] upon Cyclops' call to all mutants. She fought alongside X-23, Emma Frost, and Dust against the [[Skrulls|Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion]].{{Citation}}

Following The Invasion, [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] established his own task-force, [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]], and taking advantage of an anti-mutant riot publicly vilified the X-Men as threats to the American people. In response the X-Men established their own island nation of [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]]. Not to be outdone, Osborn made one more play to discredit them and tracked down Cessily's father, half bribing/half-threatening him to lie to the media that the X-Men were dangerous criminals holding his daughter captive. The situation was resolved to everyone's surprise by [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], who initially attempted to assassinate Cessily's father as a misguided means of gaining X-Men membership. At gunpoint and on live television, her father's lie is revealed and Osborn is discredited. Furthermore, by allowing the X-Men to defeat him, Deadpool boosts their own media profile as heroes.{{Citation}}

Cessily joined the rest of the X-Men as a resident of Utopia. Following attacks from a pack of Predator X, a confrontation with the [[U-Men (Earth-616)|U-Men]], a Necromorph invasion led by [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]] and Wither, [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]]'s attack forces during [[Second Coming]], [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]]'s reality warping [[Age of X]], [[Fear Itself]], and finally the [[Schism (Event)|Schism]], she decided that life on Utopia simply wasn't safe and joined [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s side in returning to a school in [[Westchester]] alongside classmates Hellion, [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]], and [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]].{{Citation}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Cessily was one of the mutants that confronted [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]] when he tried to impose his vision of the world upon the world.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9}} When Nate Grey decided that things wouldn't get better as long as the X-Men existed, he made them disappear in an instant, including Cessily.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 10}}

===Age of X-Man===
Cessily and the other X-Men were transported to a [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|reality]] created by Nate Grey and a [[Life Seed]] where Grey attempted to create a utopia where mutants lived in peace. Cessily had her memories of her previous life erased by Nate.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}

Cessily became a bar bouncer for an unnamed bar at the corner of Grant and Westing, with a moth logo, that [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner)]] was invited to dally at with [[Meggan Puceanu (Earth-616)|Meggan Puceanu]]. The bar was a place where people could engage in illicit intimacy with one another.{{r|Age of X-Man: The Amazing Nightcrawler Vol 1 2}}

Cessily was later allowed by Nate Grey to return to the real world after he realized the flaws of his reality and the way he ran it.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

===Krakoa===
Mercury became a citizen of the new mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. She is seen reunited with the Hellions Squad in the Akademos Habitat.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 1}} 

After the [[Hellfire Gala]] she attempted to have sex with [[Alani Ryan (Earth-616)|Loa]] but the combination of their powers made it impossible. [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] asked [[David Haller (Earth-616)|David Haller]] to help the two of them by allowing them to be intimate through a mind connection. However, due to [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]] their deepest and and darkest desires were exposed and both of them became disgusted with one another. Both Loa and Mercury then ran off from each other.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 3}}

'''Malleable Bio-Mercury Form:''' She is composed of a non-toxic liquid mercury. Her form allows her to alter her shape by collapsing into a featureless mass, extending blades from her skin, or moulding herself into different forms. Her ability to shape shift extends to the most basic of rudimentary weapons. Her liquid mercury form is non-organic.
*'''''Self-Sustenance:''''' She is no longer a carbon-based life form and does not eat or breathe the same way as normal humans. Still, she consumes food out of habit and has not realized the scope of her change.
*'''''Telepathic Resistance:''''' She is very hard to telepathically detect or influence while in her mercury form.
*'''''Molecular Adhesion''''': This gives her the ability to cling to solid surfaces and move her body at will even without overt locomotive features.
*'''''Enhanced Durability:''''' Her skin, bone, and muscle transformed into liquid mercury to make it stronger and harder than human; impervious to injury to a certain extent.
*'''''Magical Resistance:''''' Due to her transient body, it's harder to magically detect, influence, or harm her than other humans and mutants, but her resistance is far from infinite and can be overwhelmed by more skilled magicians like [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]] and [[Magik]].

Mercury was considered a '''Significant Threat''' by the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]], at the time of the [[M-Day]].{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}} [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] later classified her as a '''Threat Level: Medium'''.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 31}}

| Notes                   = * The use of her powers can sometimes be embarrassing for Cessily: with her ability to re-shape any part of her body, she is able to "melt" herself and turn into a living puddle of mercury. When she does this, however, she is unable to keep her clothes on. Therefore, when she shapes herself back into her humanoid form, she will be nude.{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 #7}}
* Cessily was disappointed about not losing her powers due to [[Decimation|M-Day]], as she was seen looking into a mirror while saying, "Why not me? Why not me?"{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #20}}
* Her creators stated that she is Irish-American. In her first appearance, she was sixteen-years-old.<ref>According to statements made on DeFilippis and Weir's creators forum on comixfan.net, now defunct.</ref>

*She was once a cheerleader prior to her mutation. {{r|New X-Men Vol 2 34}}
