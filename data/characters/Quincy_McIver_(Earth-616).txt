===Early Life===
Quincy McIver was born on a Caribbean island. He became a quadruple amputee when he lost his arms and legs in a boating accident while trying to evade the police underwater.{{r|Captain America Annual #10}}

===Bushmaster===
Shortly later, the [[Roxxon Oil]] Company equipped him with bionic arms and a snake-like tail in the place of the lower half of his body. He took the name "Bushmaster" from his fallen brother, the first [[John McIver (Earth-616)|Bushmaster]].{{r|Captain America Annual #10}}

===Serpent Society===
Years later, [[Seth Voelker (Earth-616)|Sidewinder]] enlisted Bushmaster to join the criminal trade union known as the [[Serpent Society (Earth-616)|Serpent Society]].{{r|Captain America #310}} Bushmaster was grateful for the unity and the steady employment. After all, he considered himself to be a freak, and the Society was his best chance in life. In fact, he made a friend in [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]], a fellow Society member.{{r|Captain America #312}} On his first mission with the Serpent Society, he was hired by A.I.M. to hunt down [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]].

He soon received new bionic arms.{{r|Captain America #313}}{{r|Captain America #315}}{{r|Captain America #319}}

===Viper===
After the Viper took over the Society, Bushmaster remained loyal to Sidewinder. He was poisoned by the Viper, but was saved by Captain America and Diamondback.{{r|Captain America #341}}{{r|Captain America #342}} He then participated in the Serpent Society's mission to recover mystic objects for [[Ghaur (Earth-616)|Ghaur]] and [[Llyra Morris (Earth-616)|Llyra]]. He withdrew from combat against the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] to repay his debt to Diamondback.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 13}}He was with the Society when Cobra went for revenge against [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mister Hyde]]. {{r|Captain America #365}}

Sidewinder, disillusioned by the betrayals of some of the Serpents, had turned over control of the guild to the Cobra, and Bushmaster served him next. At Diamondback's trial, Bushmaster voted to spare her life from a death sentence.{{r|Captain America #380}} After the trial, Bushmaster fought Diamondback, and next, [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]].{{r|Captain America #381}} He was finally taken into custody.{{r|Captain America #382}} He was later released from the [[Vault (Prison)|Vault]].{{r|Captain America Annual #10}} The Serpent Society battled Cap again.{{r|Captain America #435|437}} and then was taken out at [[Yankee Stadium]].{{r|Captain America Vol 4 #30|31}}

===Civil War===
During the superhuman [[Civil War]], Quincy McIver, like many other villains, was apprehended by [[Helmuth Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] and forced to join [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]]. He briefly appeared along with fellow Serpent Society members [[King Cobra]] and [[Rattler]].{{r|Thunderbolts #104}}

In the end, the [[frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] managed to sabotage this zoo; though Kraven himself escaped to the Savage Land.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 #15}}

===New Avengers===
Later, several Serpent Society members including Bushmaster, fought members of the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] in a semi-tropical locale. He was defeated by [[Ronin]] and [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 #73}}
 
===X-Men===
Bushmaster and the Serpent Society are one of the many villains the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] took down while protecting [[San Francisco]]. They were robbing a bank until they are defeated by [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]]. {{r|X-Men: To Serve and Protect #2|4}}{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #0}}  

===Nick Fury, Jr.===

Bushmaster and the Serpent Society were at the Club With No Name when [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] was on the hunt of a fellow thief.{{r|Gambit Vol 5 #9}}

===Hunted===
Bushmaster was among several animal-themed super-villains captured by Taskmaster and [[Eric O'Grady (LMD) (Earth-616)|Black Ant]] to serve as hunting targets in [[Central Park]] for a host of wealthy participants controlling robotic drones, part of a plot concocted by [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]] and [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 16}}

When the force field keeping the criminals inside Central Park dissipated, several superheroes ambushed and apprehended Bushmaster and the other escaped villains.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 23}}

===Criminal Technology Show Expo===
Bushmaster, with several other members of the Serpent Society, attended the Criminal Technology Show Expo. Bushmaster and his teammates went to the restroom where they were ambushed by [[M.O.D.O.K. Superior (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]] and beaten to near death. [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], working with M.O.D.O.K., suggested they hide the villains before they regain consciousness. King Cobra later discovered them and alerted the rest of the supervillains of M.O.D.O.K.'s and Iron Man's presence.{{r|M.O.D.O.K.: Head Games Vol 1 2}}
