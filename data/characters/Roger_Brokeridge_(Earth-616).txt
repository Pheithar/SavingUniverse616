===Origin===
'''Roger Brokeridge''' was born in a middle class suburb of [[Los Angeles]], his early life is mostly unknown. At some point his brother [[Paul Brokeridge (Earth-616)|Paul]] got enhancements from a new [[Power Broker (Power Broker, Inc.) (Earth-616)|Power Broker]], giving him an immense physique and strength. Paul then joined the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation (Earth-616)|Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]], but suffered an intense injury, leaving him immobile, and costing his parents an immense amount to treat him. Angry over how this was affecting his family, Roger tried to work up the courage to kill his brother and end their familial suffering, but he ultimately couldn't do it. Deciding, instead, to kill the Power Broker for giving his brother the powers, Roger approached him, but was ultimately convinced to gain power himself. Undergoing an immensely painful procedure, he gained the ability to create balls of hard light.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Annual #1}}

Intending to turn to crime in order to help pay off his debts to the Power Broker, Roger cased the route of an armored truck. When he finally planned to rob the truck, he accidentally prevented the truck from hitting a young girl. Thinking he had saved the girl on purpose, the guards thanked him. An arriving [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] also thanked him, and convinced him to the join the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]]. Since becoming a hero wasn't profitable, the Power Broker sold his contract to [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Annual #1}}

===[[Initiative]]===
[[File:Roger Brokeridge (Earth-616) from Avengers The Initiative Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Roger Brokeridge]]
One of the new Initiative recruits that arrived with [[Elvin Haliday (Earth-616)|Rage]], [[Abigail Boylen (Earth-616)|Cloud 9]], [[Michael van Patrick (Earth-616)|MVP]], and others, Brokeridge displayed an outgoing and arrogant personality, hitting on [[Tarene (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Thor Girl]] on the bus ride in and cracking a joke about not having a cape when receiving his fatigues. During the training mishap with [[Violet Lightner (Earth-616)|Armory]] he exhibited the ability to create an energy ball that deflected the lethal blasts from Armory's Tactigon.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #1}}

On his first mission, he helped defend the President against an assault from Hydra. As he returned from the mission, he accidentally witnessed [[Melati Kusuma (Earth-616)|Komodo]] depowered while she slept. Awaking, Komodo grew angry and attacked him, only backing off when forced to by [[Joseph Green (Earth-616)|Gauntlet]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 2|3}}

Arriving back at Camp Hammond, he was involved in a several training exercises, including being taught water safety by [[Walter Newell (Earth-616)|Stingray]]. At the end of the day, he participated in an assault exercise with several of his teammates as they attempted to "assault" the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]]. After this final exercise, he headed into town where he was treated as a villain until [[Arthur Woodman (Earth-616)|Senator Arthur Woodman]], a Hydra agent approached him with knowledge of Roger's real name. Woodman then forced Roger to steal a vial of [[Super-Power Inhibiting Nanobots]] from [[Camp Hammond]], causing problems later on for [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] when he battled the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] during World War Hulk.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 3|4}}

Brokeridge was present at Camp Hammond when [[KIA (Earth-616)|KIA]], a rogue clone of the deceased [[Michael van Patrick (Earth-616)|MVP]], attacked the trainees and their mentors, in a hunt for anyone present when MVP was killed as well as those involved in the ensuing coverup. Brokeridge and Komodo were caught fraternising moments before the attack began.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 10}} Brokeridge accompanied Komodo and Cloud 9 to [[Tennessee (State)|Tennessee]] through a Negative Zone portal in an attempt to use another [[Michael van Patrick (Clone) (Earth-616)|clone]] to help shut down KIA but the group were attacked by a recently reformed New Warriors who would call themselves [[Counter Force (Earth-616)|Counter Force]], who believed they might be being misled by the Initiative. When KIA arrived and attacked, Brokeridge helped to fight against him alongside the others, and had to amputate Komodo's damaged legs so she could regrow them.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 10|11}} Soon after this he attended the funeral of [[Terrance Ward (Earth-616)|Trauma]], who returned to life during the viewing of his body.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 12}}

Roger along with Komodo, Cloud 9, [[Tsu-Zana (Earth-616)|Ultra Girl]], [[Delroy Garrett Jr. (Earth-616)|3-D Man]], Thor Girl, [[Terrance Ward (Earth-616)|Trauma]]. All of which, with the exception of Trauma, were given states to protect as graduated members of The Initiative, along with new costumes. Roger was then assigned to Nevada's Initiative team, the [[Heavy Hitters (Earth-616)|Heavy Hitters]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 12}}

During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] Roger and the Heavy Hitters, including Gravity, Nonstop, and Telemetry, helped the [[Skrull Kill Krew (Earth-616)|Skrull Kill Krew]] and [[Delroy Garrett Jr. (Earth-616)|3-D Man]] deal with a Skrull infiltrator posing as an unnamed Heavy Hitters team member. He then left with Komodo, 3-D Man, and the Krew to help the other Initiative teams.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #17}}

===[[Dark Reign]]===
After the invasion, Hardball's status as an agent for Hydra led to a confrontation against the rest of the Heavy Hitters and a visiting Komodo. Hardball killed Senator Woodman, effectively becoming the new leader of Woodman's Hydra cell. This ended his relationship to the Initiative and to a saddened Komodo as well.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Special #1}}

Hardball was revealed to be running a Hydra training camp in [[Madripoor]] and became the lover of [[Carmilla Black (Earth-616)|Scorpion (Carmilla Black)]]. The [[Shadow Initiative]] arrived in Madripoor to capture him, only to be caught off guard with enhanced [[S.P.I.N. Tech]] darts that blocked Komodo's powers. The Shadow Initiative briefly retreats, returning and claiming they wish to switch sides, allowing them to gain access to the Hydra base's weapons, and take them down from within. During the fight, it was revealed that Hardball only joined Hydra because he had no alternative. He willingly surrendered to [[Frank Schlichting (Earth-616)|Constrictor]], and was incarcerated in the [[Negative Zone]] [[Prison 42|prison]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #20|24}} Hardball was conscripted by [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]] to serve him when he invaded the prison, but Hardball aided the [[Shadow Initiative (Earth-616)|Shadow Initiative]] when they arrived to liberate the prison. He was then placed on the Shadow Initiative as a result of his efforts, prompting Komodo to quit the team.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #30}}

During the last hours of [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn's]] [[Dark Reign|time in power]] he injected Komodo with a serum that neutralized the S.P.I.N. Tech in her, restoring her powers.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #36}}

===Briggs Chemical===
Hardball was later among the heroes on the side of [[Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616)|Alchemist (Jeremy Briggs)]] in his fight against [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]].{{r|Avengers Academy #26}}

| Powers                  = *'''Energy Spheres''': Hardball has the ability to create spheres of solid energy that he can use both as a defensive shield and as weapons. He has learned that his "hard balls" can be used to amputate limbs, as shown when he removed [[Melati Kusuma (Earth-616)|Komodo]]'s legs to save her from a poison. His skill with his powers developed to the point where he was able to instantly decapitate multiple people at once without much effort by creating spheres around their heads.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 #27}} He could also use his spheres as cages to restrain people.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 #27}} During the battle against [[Michael van Patrick (KIA) (Earth-616)|KIA]] he displayed the ability to create full-body shield, effectively creating a force field to protect something the size of at least himself and Komodo.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 11}}

*'''Electromagnetic Spheres''': Although he prefers to keep this ability a secret he can also create spheres of electromagnetic energy capable of deactivating sophisticated electronic devices and manipulating metal objects.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 #4}}
