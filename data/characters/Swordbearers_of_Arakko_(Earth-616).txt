| Overview                = The '''Swordbearers of Arakko''' were chosen by [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Omniversal Majestrix Opal Luna Saturnyne]] to stand against the [[Swordbearers of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Swordbearers of Krakoa]].

| HistoryText             = When the forces of [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]], led by the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|First Horsemen of Apocalypse]], entered [[Otherworld]] they ravaged [[Dryador]]. Using the [[External Gate]], [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] led a group of [[Homo superior|mutants]] to Otherworld where they were almost immediately ambushed by First Horsemen of Apocalypse and [[Summoner (Arakko) (Earth-616)|Summoner]]. To end the fighting, [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Omniversal Majestrix Opal Luna Saturnyne]] offered the Horsemen and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] the opportunity to enter a [[X of Swords|tournament of champions]]. With no alternatives, both sides accepted the offer and Saturnyne magically implanted the tournament weapons and champions into the minds of [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] and [[Pestilence (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|Pestilence]].{{r|X of Swords: Creation Vol 1 1}}

With only three days prepare for battle, the chosen swordbearers set out to gather their swords. [[War (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|War]] and Pestilence travelled to [[Tower of Broken Will|The Tower of Broken Will]] to release [[Solem (Earth-616)|Solem]]. After being freed, Solem travelled to [[Hell]] and enlist the aid of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] to obtain the [[Muramasa Blade]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 6}}{{r|X-Force Vol 6 13}}
