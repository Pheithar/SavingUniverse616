One of the Eights was [[Lu Wei (Earth-616)|Lu Wei]], the mother of Chinatown vigilante [[Samuel Chung (Earth-616)|Blindspot]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 5 2}} 

When a [[Fist (Hand) (Earth-616)|Fist]] of [[Hand (Earth-616)|The Hand]] attacked Tenfingers to reclaim the power he had stolen from them, he ordered the Eights to kill several of his followers that had witnessed him fail. Blindspot stood in their way to protect the innocents. In the end, as an act of faith, Lu Wei killed her two fellow Eights fighting Blindspot and walked away.{{r|Daredevil Vol 5 5}}
