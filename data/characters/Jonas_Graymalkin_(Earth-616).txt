===Origin===
'''Jonas Graymalkin''' was born in [[American Revolutionary War|pre-revolutionary America]]. At the age of sixteen he was aware of the turmoil in the colonies over taxation from the [[Palace of Westminster|British Parliament]] but he did not care. Jonas was coming to terms with his own issues as he just realized he was gay. One day while meeting another boy in his family's barn he was discovered by his father, a religious man, who believed his son to be an abomination and a spawn of the devil. Beating Jonas nearly to death, his father then sought to bury him alive in the nearby woods. This burial triggered Jonas' mutant powers, allowing him to survive some 200 years underground before being unearthed in the modern era.{{r|X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3}}

===Final Genesis===
Jonas was able to rise from his would-be-grave located under the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] when it was blasted open by the last [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E (Earth-616)|Sentinel]] attack that destroyed the school. He was greeted by [[Alisa Tager (Earth-616)|Cipher]],{{r|Young X-Men #10}} and after their meeting, the two of them observed the [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] impostor, [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]], training the [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]]. Jonas resolved to kill whom he thought was Cyclops.

When he attempted to kill Pierce, he met [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]] and [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]] prior to Pierce's escape.{{r|Young X-Men #3}} After the final battle with Pierce, Jonas was recruited into the Young X-Men team.{{r|Young X-Men #5}}

===Manifest Destiny: Abomination===
After performing a genetic test, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] discovered that Graymalkin was a collateral ancestor of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]], hence how his last name is the street that the Xavier Institute was built on.

Beast analyzed the boy's powers but to his ignorance, could not determine what discrimination could have doomed him to being buried alive if his powers emerged while buried.{{r|X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3}}

[[File:Jonas Graymalkin (Earth-616) and Victor Borkowski (Earth-616) from X-Men Manifest Destiny Vol 1 3 001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Jonas coming out to Victor]]

[[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]] comforted him stating that it was not his fault nor his father's because of the lack of tolerance 200 years ago, after Jonas had told him his life story.{{r|X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3}}

===Book Of Revelations===
With surprising ease, he adjusted to the 21st century well. However, he was still weary of his "identity" as a gay man to the point where he would not let [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] read his mind for fear of how she would judge.{{r|Young X-Men #7}}

Despite his inexperience in battle, Graymalkin continued to work as a full member of the Young X-Men. He assisted in the fight against [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]],{{r|Young X-Men #7}} the defeat of the [[Y-Men (Earth-616)|Y-Men]],{{r|Young X-Men #9}} and the battle with [[Neo (Earth-616)|The Neo]] on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].{{r|Young X-Men #12}}

He formed a close friendship with Anole, and was pivotal in integrating [[Alisa Tager (Earth-616)|Cipher]] into the Young X-Men. He also reached out to [[Eric Gitter (Earth-616)|Ink]] when he was struggling with alienation from his team and the news that he was not in fact a [[Homo Superior|mutant]].{{r|Young X-Men #9}} 

===Secret Invasion, Utoptia & Nation X===
[[File:Tandy Bowen (Earth-616) and X-Men (Earth-616) from Cloak and Dagger Vol 4 1 001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Storm supervising the training session of Graymalkin, Anole, Rockslide, and Dagger]]
Graymalkin was seen fighting alongside the other X-Men in [[San Francisco]] during the [[Skrulls|Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]].{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men #3}}

When anti-mutant protesters led by [[Simon Trask (Earth-616)|Simon Trask]] marched in San Francisco in support of [[Proposition X]], Graymalkin and a number of other mutants were part of a pro-mutant rights mob and attempted to stall their demonstration. When [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]] taunted the protesters, Trask incited a riot and Graymalkin was seen fighting them off alongside Anole and Beast.

On the island nation of [[Utopia]], Graymalkin continued his combat training along with Anole, [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]], and [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]].{{r|Cloak and Dagger Vol 4 1}}

===Schism and Jean Grey School===
After the schism between Wolverine and Cyclops, Graymalkin transferred along with most of the young mutants on Utopia to the [[Jean Grey School]], in Westchester, New York.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #1}}

===Krakoa===
Graymalkin was one of the many mutants that joined the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] upon its creation. He was seen alongside many other Krakoans grieving Charles Xavier death at the hands of anti-mutant super-human criminals that had infiltrated Krakoa and killed many of its residents, including Xavier.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 2}}

| Powers                  = 
'''[[Darkness Empowerment]]:''' Graymalkin's mutant powers are related to light exposure; the darker it is, the greater his powers become, the absence of light triggering his powers.{{r|X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3}} His powers strengthen with a lack of light, and he is weaker with exposure to light. Doctor McCoy stated he was unpowered in the presence of light.{{r|X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3}} Graymalkin has demonstrated the following powers:
* '''[[Superhuman Strength]]''', or enhanced,{{r|X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3}} to an unknown degree
* '''Nigh-[[Invulnerability]]'''
* '''Enhanced Agility'''{{r|X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3}}
* '''Longevity''' (or possible '''[[Immortality]]''') allowing him to survive without food or water indefinitely: In complete darkness, he was able to survive 200 years with neither food nor water.{{r|X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3}}
* '''Night Vision''' allowing him to see clearly in total darkness

| Notes                   = * Although Graymalkin is fairly introverted and especially distrusting of adults (possibly due to his father attempting to murder him), he has formed close friendships with his teammates [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]], [[Alisa Tager (Earth-616)|Cipher]], and [[Eric Gitter (Earth-616)|Ink]].
