===Origin===
Growing up largely unaware of his family's illegal gun-smuggling syndicate, young Julio Esteban Richter saw many hardships. After spending some time in jail with his father, Julio was forced to watch his father's murder, by the time-tossed villain [[Nathan Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]], during an arms deal gone bad. When his [[Homo superior|mutant]] seismic powers manifested, Julio accidentally destroyed three city blocks. This brought Julio to the attention of [[Right (Earth-616)|The Right]], an anti-mutant organization, who kidnapped him. Dubbing him '''Rictor''', they explained his mutation to him, tortured him, and attempted to force Rictor into using his seismic powers to destroy [[San Francisco]], while claiming to be allied with the mutant terrorists, X-Terminators, [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]'s alter egos. Thankfully, Rictor was saved by X-Factor and accepted their invitation to join as a trainee member, at the [[X-Factor Complex]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 17}}

===X-Factor Trainee===
While training at the Complex, Rictor was among the first to notice X-Factor PR man, [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]]'s devious acts, as he noticed that Hodge's voice matched that of the leader of The Right.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 18}} After X-Factor battled [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]]'s [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horsemen]], in [[Central Park]], [[Russell Collins (Earth-616)|Rusty Collins]] decided to melt the mountain of ice that [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] had used to subdue the villains, and Rictor fist-fought Rusty, worried that his powers may get out of control and do more harm than good. When Rusty left anyway, Rictor saved Rusty from a gang and he and Rusty worked together to melt the ice and leave a message: "By Their Deeds You Shall Know Them - Mutants Were Here".{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 20}} The children of X-Factor were captured by The Right and Rictor was again to be used as a weapon. Rictor was rescued by fellow student [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom Boom]]; however, Rictor and Boom-Boom were immediately recaptured until X-Factor arrived and rescued them.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 21|23}}

===Living on Ship===
After their defeat of Apocalypse, his [[Prosh (Earth-616)|Ship]] crash landed on their Complex and X-Factor began living on Apocalypse's sentient Ship, that had a barrier only mutants could enter, and [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]] left with Apocalypse. After the children were given Christmas gifts as donations, they decided to give them to the children who lost their homes during X-Factor's battle.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 25|26}} While sleeping, X-Factor and the kids were attacked by Ship, still under the control of Apocalypse, until Rusty freed its consciousness and X-Factor expelled a bomb. Ship, now able to speak, asked to join them. Ship had complete control over every part of its structure and could fashion rooms, weapons, and vehicles as needed from various storehouses and parts it had. Ship was able to design and run training programs for X-Factor, as well as make living quarters and workshop areas for them.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 28|30}} While playing around on Ship, the students ran into [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], who was going over old photos of X-Factor in their teens and revealed their origins, as the original [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and students at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]].{{r|X-Factor Annual Vol 1 3}} After Iceman was tricked by [[Infectia (Josephine) (Earth-616)|Infectia]] to allow her on Ship, Beast attempted to warn Iceman, who was being seduced by her, but due to Beast's lack of intelligence, Iceman couldn't understand him and the students kept her from kissing Iceman.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 30|31}} When the [[Xartans]] and [[Zano (Xartan) (Earth-616)|Lord Zano]], in [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] disguise, attacked X-Factor, the children were protected by Ship, but later aided X-Factor.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 32}} After finding that they were going to be sent to a private school, [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]] and Iceman took the kids shopping for clothes, where they were attacked by the [[Alliance of Evil (Earth-616)|Alliance of Evil]]. After defeating the Alliance of Evil, [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]] showed-up and ordered Rusty and X-Factor to register, to which X-Factor accepted and Rusty turned himself into the Navy.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 33}}

===X-Terminators===
After seeing Rusty off at a Naval base, [[Sally Blevins (Earth-616)|Skids]], Boom-Boom, and Rictor were enrolled at Phillips Academy, in Exeter, [[New Hampshire (State)|New Hampshire]]. After a cold reception from the other students of the academy, the students were awakened in their dorms by [[Takeshi Matsuya (Earth-616)|Takeshi Matsuya (Wiz Kid)]], informing them that [[Arthur Maddicks (Earth-616)|Artie Maddicks]] and [[Leech (Earth-616)|Leech]] had been kidnapped by demons. After leaving the dorms, the students rescued Rusty from his prison and began the search for Artie and Leech.{{r|X-Terminators Vol 1 1}} After stopping to get new outfits, Rictor suggested the name [[X-Terminators (Earth-616)|X-Terminators]] for the group, to honor X-Factor, and the group was attacked by demons who kidnapped [[Takeshi Matsuya (Earth-616)|Taki]]. Following a mental image from Artie, the X-Terminators battled an invasion of demons.{{r|X-Terminators Vol 1 2}} After being captured by the demons, the X-Terminators were teleported to [[Times Square]], where the New Mutant [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] was opening a portal to return her teammates from the demon infested dimension of [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]]. The demon [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]] kept the portal open using [[Inferno Babies (Earth-616)|ten kidnapped mutant infants]], one of them being [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Nathan Summers]], as the points of an inverted pentagram. The infants provided strong focusing beams of power because of their purity and openness to use them as natural, living conduits who could not block the flow of power, and who would not know how to shut it off.{{r|X-Terminators Vol 1 3|4}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 72}}

After Artie and Leech freed the X-Terminators, they battled the horde of demons that flowed out of the portal and, after [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]] rescued Rusty and Skids, joined the New Mutants in rescuing the infants being used to keep the portal open. Rusty suggested that the X-Terminators rescue their teammate, Taki, while the New Mutants continued to rescue the infants and disrupt the pentagram. After rescuing Taki, Julio joined the New Mutants as they began searching for the demonic Magik.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 72}}

While searching for the [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Darkchilde]] throughout the city, Rictor and the New Mutants witnessed [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], the New Mutants new headmaster, and the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)#Inner Circle Lineups|Inner Circle]] of the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] meeting with N'astirh and lost all trust in him. The New Mutants, Boom-Boom, and Rictor found Darkchilde battling the demon, [[S'ym (Earth-616)|S'ym]], at the same time her brother, the X-Man [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], appeared. Colossus was shocked to see his Little Snowflake in such a state and Darkchilde was embarrassed and teleported away, taking the young heroes with her to Limbo, where she finally decided to stop running from her responsibilities as the ruler of Limbo. Unwilling to lose her friend and teammate, [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]], jumped into a teleportation disc and found the younger [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Illyana Rasputin]] and delivered her before the Darkchilde. Darkchilde emerged from her armor and began to glow of pure light, attempting to kill her younger self, but Wolfsbane stopped her, stating that saving the young Illyana would bring peace to the older Darkchilde. Darkchilde found a way to stop Inferno, although she knew it risked her no longer existing. Darkchilde opened a tremendous portal and sucked all of the remaining demons back to Limbo. Burning so bright with energy, that it hurt to look at her, the Lightchilde hurled her [[Soulsword]] into the air and the demons were banished, leaving only the charred remains of her eldritch armor. Colossus cradled the badly damaged armor and heard someone call his name from inside. Opening the armor, Colossus found Illyana had returned to her natural age of a seven year old girl.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 73}}

===New Mutants===
The X-Terminators and New Mutants returned to X-Factor's Ship, with the mutant babies and [[Gosamyr (Earth-616)|Gosamyr]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 74}} Due to his actions during the demonic invasion, Julio was expelled from Phillips Academy and, while the New Mutants returned home and X-Factor attended funerals, the X-Terminators found an [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] horn and accidentally called forth a giant sea creature. The New Mutants returned and, with the aid of [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor the Submariner]], they defeated it. After the creature's defeat, X-Factor returned and the New Mutants began to live on Ship, merging with the X-Terminators as [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]]'s [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|mansion]] had been destroyed.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 76}} The all-new New Mutants team returned Illyana to her home in Ust-Ordynski Collective, [[Siberia]], with her parents. On their return home, [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Mirage]] and [[Brightwind (Earth-616)|Brightwind]], her winged horse, became ill with a mystical fever. Unaware of how to save Mirage, Ship suggested that the New Mutants go to [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]] to help her. After arriving at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum|Sanctum Sanctorum]], the New Mutants were startled to learn that Dr. Strange was apparently "dead" and they were attacked by a possessed, inflamed Mirage and Brightwind. Mirage reasserted control and Dr. Strange, disguised as "Dr. Sanders", returned all that her body had damaged to normal.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 77}} While returning Mirage and Brightwind to Ship, the New Mutants were attacked by [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]] (government-chartered mutant enforcers composed of former members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]), believing Rusty caused all of the flames. The battle between the New Mutants and Freedom Force awoke Mirage and Brightwind and Ship suddenly warped-off into space with X-Factor. After Rusty and Skids learned that the government never returned the infants to their parents, Dr. Strange teleported the remaining New Mutants to [[Asgard]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 78}}

[[File:Julio Richter (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 271 0001.png|thumb|100px|left]]
After arriving in Asgard, the New Mutants realized that Ship had been sent to the [[Negative Zone]] and [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Dani Moonstar]] left them. After being captured by [[Dwarves]], the New Mutants were released and joined them, due to Cannonball's relationship with [[Eitri (Earth-616)|Eitri]], king of the Dwarves.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 79|80}}

As part of the New Mutants, Rictor helped battle [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]]'s [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]], [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]], and former ally [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]], who had become the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horseman]] [[Death]], and [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] while battling in the [[Alley|Morlock tunnels]] under [[New York City]]. Rictor was severely injured by Sabretooth, but was saved by [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] and the other New Mutants.{{r|New Mutants #90|91}}

During this time, Rictor first became interested in his teammate [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]], which in turn made Boom Boom extremely jealous.

Rictor was later captured alongside [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], Boom Boom, Wolfsbane, and [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]] by forces of the island nation [[Genosha]]. Only he and Boom Boom escaped unscathed. The combined efforts of the X-Men, X-Factor, and New Mutants led to him being freed. During this adventure, Rictor shared a heartfelt kiss with Wolfsbane and was later heartbroken when she chose to stay behind.{{r|New Mutants #93|94}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #270|272}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 60|62}}

===X-Force===
[[File:X-Force -19 team shot.jpeg|thumb|right|Running with X-Force]]
After the business in Genosha, Rictor left the New Mutants with the intent of reuniting with Wolfsbane back on Genosha.{{r|New Mutants #98}} Unable to find Wolfsbane, Rictor joined the [[Canada|Canadian government]]'s [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E. (Earth-616)|Weapon P.R.I.M.E. team]],{{r|X-Force #10}} whose sole purpose was the apprehension of Cable. At this time, Rictor was still convinced that Cable was the man who killed his father when Stryfe, Cable's evil clone, was actually his father's murder.{{r|Cable - Blood and Metal Vol 1 2}}

After Rictor learned the truth about his father's death, he rejoined his friends in the New Mutants, now formed into the paramilitary team [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]]. Almost immediately after joining X-Force, Rictor and his new teammates were captured by the X-Men and X-Factor who were seeking Cable for the attempted murder of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]]; an act that had also been perpetrated by Stryfe. Cable was eventually cleared of the charges and Rictor continued on with X-Force where he first met [[Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse)|Shatterstar]]. Shatterstar and Rictor formed a close friendship that developed into a secret romance.{{r|X-Cutioner's Song}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 45}}

With X-Force, Rictor battled [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] on board [[Avalon (Space Station)|Graymalkin]] and saved his teammates from [[Gideon (Earth-616)|Gideon]] and the [[Externals (Earth-616)|Externals]]. After Rictor helped Shatterstar through a personal crisis, the pair left X-Force to travel to [[Mexico]] and put an end to the Richter family gun-smuggling business.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 20|22}}{{r|X-Force #70}}{{r|X-Force Annual #1999}}

===X-Corporation===
Rictor would later be one of several former members of X-Force who joined Professor X's restructured [[X-Corporation (Earth-616)|X-Corporation]]. Rictor was located in the [[Paris (France)|Paris]] X-Corp center and participated in X-Corporation's confrontation with [[Zona Cluster-6 (Earth-616)|Weapon XII]], which was a total catastrophe and led to the death of one of their members, [[Laynia Petrovna (Earth-616)|Darkstar]].{{r|New X-Men #128|130}} It is unclear if Rictor left X-Corp before or after it disbanded following [[Decimation|M-Day]].{{r|Decimation: House of M - The Day After #1}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 1}}

===X-Factor Investigations===
After losing his powers on [[Decimation|M-Day]], Rictor battled with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. Once, he was found by [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]] on the edge of a building ready to jump and end his life. Wanting to help his friend, Jamie sent one of his dupes to talk to Rictor. After chatting for some time, the dupe managed to get through to Rictor and he changed his mind about ending his life. However, as he was about to get away from the edge, the dupe pushed him, revealing his unstable personality. Luckily for Rictor, [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet St. Croix]] arrived at that exact instant and caught him midair. Afterwards, Rictor accepted Jamie's offer to join his detective agency in [[Middle East Side|Mutant Town]], [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations]], which Monet was also a part of.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 1|4}}

[[File:Monet St. Croix & Julio Richter (Earth-616) from X-Factor Vol 3 2 0001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|saved by Monet]]
When [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] arrived to Mutant Town, Rictor started hanging out with him, hoping to get his powers back.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 10}} Later, Quicksilver offered his aid to the [[X-Cell (Earth-616)|X-Cell]], a group believing the U.S. government to be behind the [[Decimation]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 18}} He then kidnapped [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] and lured him into working as a siphon for his power, through which he attempted to restore mutantkind.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 19}} Most X-Cell members briefly regained their powers through this method by the time X-Factor made their ambush. When Rictor realized Quicksilver was wrong, he used his powers against him and blasted the [[Terrigen Crystals]] through his body, leaving him powerless.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 17|20}} Residual crystals embedded in Rictor's skin afforded him immunity to [[Josef Huber (Earth-616)|The Isolationist]]'s many mutant powers.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 24}}

After the birth of the first human child since M-Day, Rictor was assigned to infiltrate the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]], which was easy with his depowered status.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 492}} He was able to gain credibility with the Purifiers by "shooting" Wolfsbane as she was attacking a group of them in New York.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 25}} It didn't take long for him to complete his mission and learn they didn't have the child. After the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]] attacked their compound, he managed to calm [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] and get her to teleport everyone away. After this, he was telepathically reached by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] and told her about his findings.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 44}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 205}}

Rictor and [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]]'s romantic relationship had intensified during their time together in X-Factor.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 21}} However, their romance ended when Rahne suddenly left X-Factor to join [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s black-ops [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force team]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 28}}{{r|X-Force Vol 3 1}}

Enraged that he had only been left a letter by Rahne, Rictor decided to quit as well, but was kidnapped by the X-Men villain [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] before he had the chance. Arcade had been hired by [[Taylor (Purifier) (Earth-616)|Mr. Taylor]], the purifier who had accepted Rictor into the organization, and was now looking for revenge against him for ruining his reputation. After hearing Mr. Taylor's reports, however, Arcade had decided to go bigger and act his revenge on the whole of Mutant Town. He had also spread several bombs and placed a disintegration grid surrounding Mutant Town, preventing everyone from getting in or out. In the end, X-Factor managed to shut the grid down, but they were unable to save Mutant Town, as it was destroyed by Arcade's bombs. In the aftermath of the event, [[Valerie Cooper (Earth-616)|Val Cooper]] tried to recruit the team, but they decided to escape and relocate to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan (State)|Michigan]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 29|32}}

===Coming Out===
While searching for Madrox, Rictor and [[Guido Carosella (Earth-616)|Strong Guy]] discovered a [[John Maddox (Earth-616)|dupe of Madrox]]'s had been living in New England as a priest. They decided to investigate further, hoping to find the whereabouts of Madrox Prime. Upon meeting Father Maddox, a masked man crashed through the window with swords ablaze. After a brief battle, the attacker was revealed to be [[Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse)|Shatterstar]], possessed by [[James Madrox (Cortex) (Earth-616)|unknown forces]]. Once Shatterstar was broken out of his trance-like state,{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 43}} and recognized Rictor, the two embraced one another and finally shared a kiss.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 45}}
[[File:Julio Richter (Earth-616) and Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse) from X-Factor Vol 3 45 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Rictor and Shatterstar kissing]]

Rictor and Shatterstar began a steady romantic relationship after Shatterstar's return though not without its difficulties. Rictor, having finally come to terms with his sexual identity, wanted a stable monogamous relationship with Shatterstar. Shatterstar, on the other hand, found himself interested in a more open relationship that would allow him to explore other sexual possibilities. The two resolved that they would work things out, and proceeded to make up both emotionally and physically. However, before they could get very far, the two were interrupted when a pregnant Wolfsbane barged in.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 207}}

Wolfsbane was pregnant with [[Hrimhari (Earth-616)|Hrimhari]]'s child, although she led Rictor and the others to believe he was the father.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 210}} This lie did not last long as a brief encounter between Hrimhari and Shatterstar in [[Niffleheim]] cleared up the question of paternity.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 212}}

Although initially upset about Rahne's deception, Rictor promised to stand by her and offer any aid he could.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 213}} Later, Rictor and the rest of the X-Factor Investigations crew helped protect Rahne from several lupine and feline [[Demons|demons]] coming for the baby before the birth.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 220|224}}

===Children's Crusade===
[[File:Julio Richter (Earth-616) Avengers the Children's Crusade Vol 1 6.png|thumb|right|200px|Rictor's powers restored]]
When [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Wanda Maximoff]] was rescued by the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]], [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] asked her if she would be able to reverse the affects of [[Decimation|M-Day]] by undoing the spell she had cast. Hoping to confirm his theory, [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]] called in X-Factor Investigations, hoping one of its former mutant members would be willing to participate. Rictor accepted her offer. Wanda's attempt to undo the spell succeeded and his powers were restored.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #6}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 225}}

===The Search for Rahne's Son===
After the birth and abandonment of [[Tier Sinclair (Earth-616)|Rahne's son]], she remained with X-Factor but fell into a depression. Because [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] and [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]] brought Wolfsbane to Rev. Madrox for grief counseling, she decided to find her son.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 237}} Both Rictor and Shatterstar volunteered (unsolicited) to accompany her.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 238}} The trio first traveled to [[Hel]] and received a mystic amulet to locate the child. The trio finally found him in Sproul State Forrest in [[Pennsylvania (State)|Pennsylvania]]. Unfortunately, he was being tracked independently by both [[Armando Muñoz (Earth-616)|Darwin]] and [[Vanora (Earth-7153)|Vanora]]. They evaded the attacks and escaped without harm. Once reunited with her son, Wolfsbane chose to leave X-Factor and raise him with the aid and protection of [[Jack Russell (Earth-616)|Jack Russell, the Werewolf by Night]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 242}} Shatterstar and Rictor returned to X-Factor Investigation in New York City.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 245}}

After Rahne and her son, Tier, returned to X-Factor to seek sanctuary from Darwin and other would-be assassins, all of X-Factor were transported to [[Mephisto's Realm|Hell]]. The [[Hell Lords (Earth-616)|Hell Lords]] vied to gain overall control by killing Tier, and X-Factor fought their demon armies to protect him. When Shatterstar attacked [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] to free Tier from a magical prison, Mephisto seemingly vaporized him, before doing the same to Rictor.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 256}}

===After X-Factor===
In fact, Rictor and Shatterstar both ended up going back in time and being transported to the [[Mojoverse]]. Rictor fought gladiatorial battles until he was pitted against Shatterstar. Rictor incapacitated Shatterstar and managed to escape the arena with Mojoverse rebels, including the Longshot of this era. Shatterstar was then cloned by [[Arize (Mojoverse)|Arize]], before he awoke and used his powers to transport himself and Rictor forward in time, escaping an attack by [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]] and [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]]. In this new time period, Rictor came across [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]] giving birth to Shatterstar as a baby. Rictor and Shatterstar helped to deliver the baby, before Shatterstar erased Dazzler's memory. Shatterstar then transported himself, Rictor, and himself as a baby forward in time again - by 100 years.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 259}}

Rictor and Shatterstar somehow made it back to Earth and their own time and joined their fellow mutants - including former teammates Strong Guy and Wolfsbane - in [[New Tian]]. Rictor was among the mutants that confronted [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Daisy Johnson]] and a group of Inhumans when they tried to sneak into the country.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 3}}

After New Tian was dismantled, Rictor attended [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]]'s going away party in New York and revealed that he and Shatterstar were now on a break.{{r|Iceman Vol 3 9}}

===Age of X-Man===
In the reality created by [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]] and a [[Life Seed]], a world where everyone on Earth was a mutant and relationships were strongly discouraged or illegal, Rictor was the proprietor of an independent theater. 

[[File:Julio Richter (Earth-616) from Age of X-Man The X-Tremists Vol 1 4 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px]]
He and his theater came under scrutiny from [[Department X (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Department X]] after it came to their attention that Rictor showed films encouraging love and relationships. Friend and Department X investigator [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]] volunteered to investigate the matter solo. Rictor, despite Northstar's warning, was nonchalant about Department X's interest in the theater. [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] showed up soon after, having opted to follow Northstar to the theater out of concern for his well being. This infuriated Northstar who demanded that Iceman butt out. Sensing the tension between the two, Rictor invited them up to the roof to drink with him. After several hours of drinking, Rictor passed out on Iceman, while Iceman and Northstar had a heart to heart. An explosion occurred soon after in front of the theater, instigated by [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]], who offered the three of them to join her in rioting over their stolen and slowly-returning memories. Rictor and the others happily accepted.{{r|Age of X-Man: X-Tremists Vol 1 4}}

===Krakoa===
When the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] was created, most of the world's mutants joined it, Rictor intended to do that as well, but his powers somehow went haywire making him afraid to go to Krakoa and possibly destroying the island, his powers were so uncontrolled that Rictor wouldn't even dare to come out of his house, spending most of his time in a bed like box filled with soil and depressed.

Rictor finally came to Krakoa when Apocalypse who needed Rictor's abilities went to get him. Initially Rictor refused to go fearing he would break the island in half, but Apocalypse told him not to worry, there was no place for depression in Krakoa, and if he broke anything Apocalypse would fix it. They entered a [[Gateways|Krakoan Gateway]] that took them to the [[Habitat|Krakoan habitat]] in [[Cornwall]], after arriving they were met by [[Peter Wisdom (Earth-616)|Pete Wisdom]] who was there looking for [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 3}}

At the [[Hellfire Gala]], Rictor was reunited with [[Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse)|Shatterstar]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 10}}{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 21}}

Rictor was a [[Homo superior|mutant]] who lost his [[X-Gene|mutant powers]] due to the effects of [[Decimation|M-Day]].{{r|Decimation: House of M - The Day After #1}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 1}} However, Rictor's powers were later restored by the personal intervention of the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]].{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #6}} Rictor's power once again include:
[[File:Julio Richter (Earth-616) from X-Factor Vol 3 1 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Rictor explaining his connection to [[Earth]]]]
'''Geo Connectivity:''' Like [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)#Powers|Storm]], Rictor's mutant powers have created a psychic/empathic bond between himself and the primal life force of [[Earth]]'s biosphere.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 1}}
* '''Clairvoyance:''' Rictor can gain a direct visual information about an object, person, location or physical event through means other than the his physical sight and allows him to act when he are unable to use his eyes.{{r|X-Force Annual Vol 1 1999}} He can 'see' spiritual/psychic beings and perceive the emotions, thoughts, and memories of others. As well as, being able to project himself onto the spiritual world.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #34}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 17}}{{r|X-Force Annual Vol 1 1999}}
* '''Geokinesis:''' After seeking council with his own damaged nature, Richter now has the ability to remotely terraform the ground around him in a more tactile manner than simply causing it to explode via vibration emission.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 4}} He can seemingly change and morph the very earth itself in a telekinetic fashion, from flinging rocks around with a thought to opening passageways into the ground without shattering earth & soil but by willing it to part.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 4}}
** '''Chlorokinesis:''' Richter apparently has an affinity for plant life as well as the Earth itself, being able to manipulate vines & reeds in order to entangle adversaries if need be.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 8}}
** '''Magmakinesis:''' After being left trapped below the molten bedrock of a dormant volcano to either die or thrive by [[File:En Sabah Nur (Earth-616) new name from Excalibur Vol 4 1 001.png|50px]] for a time, Rictor rose from beneath the surface in a geyser of lava, bending it in whatever direction he so chose.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 #12}}
*** '''Thermal Resilience''': Being stuck underground in a semi-dormant lava pit did little-to-no lasting damage to Richter even upon rising from beneath its encrusted surface.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 #12}}
* '''Seismic Energy Manipulation:''' Rictor is capable of generating and releasing seismic energy and tremendously powerful waves of vibrations in any object he came into physical contact with, the vibrations starting in his body, and then emanating outwards, mostly through his fingers, causing objects to shatter or crumble and also using it to create earthquakes, shock-waves or otherwise transport earth matter. When used against objects with a larger surface, the effects were much like an earthquake.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #34}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 17}}{{r|X-Force Annual Vol 1 1999}}
** '''Seismic Energy Immunity:''' Rictor is immune to the harmful effects of the vibrations he created.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #34}}

* Rictor is openly gay. Rictor has seemed to suggest he has always known deep down that he was gay and was deep in the closet.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 210}} This had been a point of debate among fans for almost two decades.
** Originally writer [[Peter David]] enjoyed playing with and joking about Rictor's ambiguous sexuality:
*** ''"I have much more fun tweaking the fans than actually spelling anything out... I certainly don't think we could say at this point that Rictor is definitively gay. I think we could make the argument that he's bi, but I don't see the point at this juncture in spelling it out – not because of any sense of homophobia or anything like that but out of a sense that I think it's more entertaining and more thought-provoking if we keep it ambiguous."'' - Peter David
** Later explaining Rictor's prior heterosexual relationships with [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom Boom]] and [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]], [[Peter David]] compares Rictor to real-life "women who eventually decided they were lesbians, had involvements with men that they ultimately considered unfulfilling."{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/peter-davids-x-factor-earth-moving-star-shattering/|title=Peter David's "X-Factor": Earth Moving, Star Shattering|work=CBR|first=Chaos|last=McKenzie|date=February 25, 2010|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}}}
** In {{cl|X-Factor Vol 3 45}}, Rictor and Shatterstar shared the first on-panel male-male kiss between two mainstream male superheroes in mainstream Marvel comic book history.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/peter-davids-x-factor-earth-moving-star-shattering/|title=Peter David's "X-Factor": Earth Moving, Star Shattering|work=CBR|first=Chaos|last=McKenzie|date=February 25, 2010|accessdate=July 22, 2020}}}}
* Rictor lost his [[mutant Biology|mutant powers]] due to the effects of [[Decimation|M-Day]]. However, [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]]'s [[Terrigen Crystals|Terrigen mutations]] briefly restored his powers. He later had his [[Mutant Genes|X-Gene]] and powers fully/permanently restored by the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]].{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #6}}
* Rictor has suffered from severe depression and suicidal thoughts since he was young. 
** When the [[Right (Earth-616)|Right]] kidnapped several [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor students]], Rictor actually contemplated suicide rather than face [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]] again.
** After losing his powers on [[Decimation|M-Day]], Rictor, facing severe depression again, would spend time on rooftops while trying to work up the courage to jump.
** Rictor once tried to take several [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E* agents]] on at gunpoint to protect [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] and her [[Sean Madrox (Earth-616)|unborn baby]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 38}} This act was recognized by several of his teammates (including Siryn) as being suicidal, over emotional, and needlessly reckless.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 43}}
* He is one of the few people with whom Shatterstar "connected", and who can be used as an "anchor" for his teleportation powers.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 49}}
