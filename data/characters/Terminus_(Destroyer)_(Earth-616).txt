| History                 = Millennia ago, the extraterrestrial [[Terminex]] race came into conflict with the [[Celestials]] and were exterminated. Before they perished, however, they engineered a life form--the [[Termini]]--that would exact their revenge on the Celestials and sent it into space.

The Terminus begins as a microbe (stage 1). When it finds an inhabited planet, native life forms ingest the microbes and change into robot versions of themselves (stage 2). The robots ingest metal and radioactive material, which provide material and fuel to grow into larger robots (stage 3). Several stage 3 robots then merge together to form a Terminus (stage 4). On the rare occasions when two Termini meet, one can ingest the other and become an Ulterminus (stage 5).{{r|Avengers: West Coast Annual #5}}{{r|Avengers Annual #19}}

The first Terminus took shape on an unknown world. It then embarked on its mission to find inhabited planets and extinguish all life on them. The exact number of planets is unknown but could reach one thousand and it included the [[Zundamites|Zundamite]] homeworld [[Zundam]]. After destroying Arianis Major, Terminus fired a beam at Earth.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 270}}

A century later the beam reached its target. It etched a message in the planet's surface in letters a half mile wide: "I claim this world~~TERMINUS."{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 269}} The [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] encountered the Zundamite scientist who, having angered Terminus by leading him to a planet not rich in natural resources, been punished. Before he died he revealed Terminus's history and nature. The FF located Terminus as he prepared to ravage Earth. [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] managed to plant an inertia-canceling gizmo on him, which sent him to the center of the Earth.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 270}}

On its trip back to the surface, Terminus contacted [[Jorro (Earth-616)|Jorro]], a [[Deviants|Deviant]], who made an armored suit like Terminus's and sought out Terminus's lance. Once he found it, he used it to wipe out the Savage Land. The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] left Jorro to die in the snow.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 257}} Some time later, Jorro's armor and [[Garokk (Earth-616)|Garokk, the Petrified Man]], fused. This hybrid creature was defeated by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]].{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 12}} Still later, a scientist named [[Mark Macross (Earth-616)|Mark Macross]], working for [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|AIM]], found the armor and repaired it. [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]] convinced him to dismantle it.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 416|417}}

Still working its way outward, Terminus created some stage 1 microbes and released them near Mount St. Helens, an active volcano. It summoned its lance and finally reached the surface, but [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]] and [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] sent it into a solar orbit outside the ecliptic, where it could not reach Earth. Quasar also teleported its lance to the outer reaches of the solar system.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 7}}

Meanwhile, the stage 1 Termini reached the surface and infected several animals, as well as some humans, which progressed to stages 2 and 3. Captain America, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]], [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] fought these robots. Thor, seeking answers, found Terminus floating in space and tried to communicate with it. He got his answers, but a biological attack incapacitated him. Terminus used Thor's hammer, [[Mjolnir]], as a power source to rebuild his lance. With the lance he traveled to Earth.

The stage 3 Termini by this time had become a new stage 4, similar to the original Terminus. These two fought each other. In the end the old Terminus consumed the new one, thereby creating a stage 5 Terminus, or Ulterminus. Apparently considering itself powerful enough to return to its original mission, it prepared to destroy Earth. All three teams of Avengers were unable to stop it. Thor, however, recovered and mystically recalled Mjolnir (still inside Terminus) to himself ... Terminus along with it. Without its power source, Terminus was forced to convert its own mass into energy. Feeding on itself, it became a singularity (black hole) and vanished.<ref>{{cl|Captain America Annual #9}}, {{cl|Iron Man Annual #11}}, {{cl|Thor Annual #15}}, {{cl|Avengers: West Coast Annual #5}}, {{cl|Avengers Annual #19}}</ref>

Terminus was not destroyed, but it was forced to undergo a dimensional odyssey. It wound up on another Earth, where it sensed more super-powered beings. Resolving to destroy them, it traveled toward Metropolis. It did battle with the Justice League of America. They defeated it when Green Lantern reflected a shot from its power lance back at it. The Spectre sent it into yet another dimension.{{r|JLA/Avengers #1}}

Returned to Earth-616 in an astral form, Terminus began infecting the minds of the [[Moloids]] of Subterranea. The [[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Mole Man]], the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]], and the Fantastic Four worked together to stop this plot and cleanse the Moloids of the infection.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 #3|4}}

Sometime later, Terminus returned in physical form, forcing the Avengers to face them. Realizing they were outmatched, [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] asks Spider-Man to call in [[Andrew Maguire (Earth-616)|Alpha]] to aid them. However, the fight between Terminus and Alpha is incredibly one-sided and dangerous as Alpha's reckless use of his powers causes airplanes in a ten mile radius to short out. In the end, Alpha defeats Terminus, but his reckless use of powers causes Spider-Man to reverse engineer Terminus' staff to drain him of his powers.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 694}}

With his staff destroyed, Terminus became much weaker. He was captured by his old enemy, the High Evolutionary and rebuilt. His new power source was the [[Children of the Sun]], who High Evolutionary kidnapped from the Avengers. They were alerted of High Evolutionary's activities by Garokk, who sensed the presence of Terminus, who he had once been bonded to. High Evolutionary attacks the Avengers with Terminus and it trades blows with [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]. Meanwhile, [[Marcus Milton (Earth-13034)|Hyperion]] talks to High Evolutionary and realizes that the children were used to power Terminus, which is why he kept them after taking DNA samples. Meanwhile, Thor beats down Terminus and is about to strike it with a lightning bolt. With no time to warn Thor, Hyperion flies through Terminus' head and rescues the children before it is fried by Thor.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 13}}

| Powers                  = 
* '''Superhuman endurance:''' Terminus can easily withstand extremes of temperature and pressure, from interstellar space to a planet's core. It can also withstand cosmic-level impacts, such as falling from orbit.
* '''Organic metal body:''' Terminus's outer shell is an organic metal that can resist almost any attack. This metal can repair itself. Once inside, an attacker is besieged by its "immune system," made up of giant insectile organisms.

| Abilities               =

| Weaknesses              = 

| Equipment               = 
* '''Energy Lance (Formerly):''' Terminus' energy lance serves as weapon, energy conduit, and transportation. It can fire energy blasts that manifest as concussion and heat. It can generate an "atomic storm" that surrounds Terminus, possibly as a form of shield. It can absorb the energy of an entire planet. It can draw Terminus through space at faster-than-light speeds. It is 240' long and is composed of the same organic metal as Terminus's body, so it is also capable of self-repair. Terminus can recall the lance to himself in some fashion, but there seems to be a distance limit.
