===Early Life===
Gideon was born in [[Spain]] during the 15th century. He became a member of the first expedition led by [[Christopher Columbus (Earth-616)|Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, aboard the [[Pinta (Ship)|Pinta]], but succumbed to scurvy. However, Gideon recovered as they reached the [[America|New World]], his nature as a mutant External allowing himself to be resurrected.{{r|X-Force #37}}<!-- 

fake origins? in {{r|Gamer's Handbook of the Marvel Universe #8|; Gideon's entry}} -->

====High Lords====
Although his subsequent history remains largely unknown, over the course of the next several hundred years, he became quite wealthy and discovered other Externals like himself. It is at this unknown point Gideon joined his fellow Externals that had formed the self-fashioned "High Lords". Together they manipulate events behind the scenes on a global scale, with the sole goal of political and monetary control over the destiny of [[Earth]].{{r|X-Force #10}}{{r|X-Force #14}}{{r|X-Force #37}}

====Stealing Power====
In 1891, [[Candra (Earth-616)|Candra]] decided that she would stop [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|En Sabah Nur]]'s glacier-like crawl to power and took the ability to fold space through her magic, where he used science. For unknown reasons the High Lords did not wish to physically act against her, so once they learned of her plans, Gideon and the others had [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Dr. Nathan Milbury]], who worked for En Sabah Nur, deal with Candra instead.{{r|Gambit Vol 3 12}}{{r|Gambit Vol 3 13}}{{r|Gambit Vol 3 14}}

Once Candra made it to En Sabah Nur's sanctum beneath the pyramids outside of [[Bani Maza]] in [[Egypt]], thanks to her [[Thieves Guild (Earth-616)|Thieves Guild]] and their leader [[Jean-Luc LeBeau (Earth-616)|Jean-Luc LeBeau]], she began to translate the text. But a time-traveling [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]], [[Jacob Gavin, Jr. (Earth-616)|Courier]], and Dr. Nathan Milbury stopped her via Milbury's transport ship. Choosing to bring down En Sabah Nur sanctum instead of fighting and steal his powers another day, Milbury quickly overpowers her with his new found metamorphic ability. Defeated, she begs for him to stop and as he does while revealing Gideon and the other four High Lords who appeared as the reason behind her loss. Candra tried to explain her actions but Gideon and the others knowing En Sabah Nor's citadel is not to be touched, his slow glaciers rise to power is not to be interrupted. For their greater glory awaits the Millennial,{{r|X-Force #12}}{{r|X-Force #17}} and Candra's actions put that at risk, thus they punished her.{{r|Gambit Vol 3 14}}

===Harvard===
At some uncertain point from [[Harvard University]]'s creation in the 17th century to the 20th century Gideon attended the school, but was expelled under circumstances to be revealed.{{r|New Mutants #99}}

===20th Century===
During the 20th Century, Gideon and the other High Lords began seeking the final External to ascend, and join their group.{{r|X-Force #10}}

====Modern Era====
As time went on he built his company, {{m|Ophrah Industries}}, into a corporate giant, intending to use his ever-growing financial power to dominate the world. But Gideon started gaining  public notice when he began forging alliances between high-tech industrial consortium's, such as [[Da Costa International (Earth-616)|Da Costa International]], [[Shaw Industries (Earth-616)|Shaw Industries]], [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]], [[Genetech (Earth-616)|GeneTech]] and [[Taylor Foundation (Earth-616)|Taylor Foundation]].{{r|New Mutants #98}}{{r|New Mutants Annual #7}}{{r|X-Factor Annual #6}}{{r|New Mutants #98}}

Gideon had come to believe a business associate and CEO of Da Costa International's son [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Roberto Da Costa]] was the next External, and befriended the family. Even planting an operative as [[Emmanuel Da Costa (Earth-616)|Emmanuel Da Costa]] personal assistant at Emmanuel's main office in [[Brazil|Brazilian]].{{r|New Mutants #99}}{{r|X-Force #10}}

====The Beginning of the End====
[[File:Vail from New Mutants Vol 1 98 001.png|thumb|left|Gideon working out]]
In his [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]] estate, Gideon prepares for the day with his morning exercise. As he breaks through some of the best combat modules Shaw Industries has to offer, has his assistant, [[Adam (Gideon) (Earth-616)|Adam]], take a memo telling [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian]] that he'd prefer him to make the little tin darlings a little quieter. Well towelling off he listened to the day's schedule. Regarding the Da Costa stock inquiry, Adam assured him the operative was [[Eve (Gideon) (Earth-616)|Eve]], happy Gideon told him to have her proceed as planned.{{r|New Mutants #98}}

In Brazilian, at the office building complex of Da Costa International, Eve poisoning Emmanuel's afternoon coffee, proceeded as ordered and killed him. Later that night Gideon awoke Roberto, who was a member of the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] and called Sunspot, to inform him of his father's death by heart attack, to the kid's shock. Over a week later, Gideon spied on a meeting with [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] and [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|James Proudstar]] at a [[Tavern on the Green]] in [[Central Park]], [[Manhattan]], as Cable told him that he had to prepare for a mutant war, which James dismissed. Gideon mused joyfully at Cable's failure to recruit Proudstar from Xavior's, when he was called away from the monitor by Adam at the arrival of Roberto. He convinced Roberto that his parents' relationship was strained, that his father loved him and wanted him to have the business empire. With this new responsibility he further manipulated Roberto into thinking it best to leave [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavior's School]] and the New Mutants, and with that Gideon became a mentor to the new CEO of Da Costa International.{{r|New Mutants #99}}

===Kings of Pain===
Gideon wanting to bring back [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]] in order to use his energies to be is ultimate tool in his control of the planets economic structure. So he hired both GeneTech to cultivate the DNA matrix of the energy and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M]]. through their [[International Data Integration and Control (Earth-616)|IDIC Corporation]] to mass-produce injection molded body casing for the containment of the energy. [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]] wanting to ingratiate the returning Proteus tortured psyche and formidable powers into his [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], joined Gideon at his mountain Chalet in Vail, Colorado. With Toad picking GeneTech and Gideon A.M.I. they play a game of chess over the outcome. Having had A.I.M. hire [[Alliance of Evil (Earth-616)|Alliance of Evil]] to protect [[Erika Benson (Earth-616)|Harness]] and [[Gilbert Benson (Earth-616)|Piecemeal]] as Piecemeal absorb the dispersed energy of Proteus, in order to recreate him. Despite [[X-Force (Earth-616)|New Mutants]], [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]], [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]], [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira]] and her team trying to save Piecemeal he exploded fusing Proteus's energy and Piecemeal into [[Proteus (Gestalt) (Earth-616)|Proteus II]].{{r|New Mutants Annual #7}}{{r|New Warriors Annual #1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual 15}}

Finally, Gilbert's body exploded, and in that instant his mind combined with that of the reformed Proteus to form a new amalgamated being. The new entity set about warping reality all over [[Scotland]].{{r|X-Factor Annual #6}} The amalgamated Proteus/Piecemeal also captured their mothers and held them hostage as the team went after them and debated whether they should kill Proteus II or try to help them. In the end, Moira convinced the new Proteus to halt his rampage and destroy himself by dispersing his energy body.{{r|X-Factor Annual #6}} Gideon unfazed by the lose covered the damage done to A.I.M.'s [[Brooklyn]] facility and the hiring of the Alliance of Evil.

===The Sabotage===
When Gideon thinks that Roberto is ready, he takes him to an acquisition meeting to buy out the Jankos Corporation. Once there, [[Arianna Jankos (Earth-616)|Arianna Jankos]] decides that she doesn't want to sell the company and hires [[Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616)|Black Tom]] to help her extort money from the assembled businessmen. In return, they brought back Tom's partner the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Jaggernaut]],{{r|X-Force # 2}} with their inter-dimensional teleportation machine. Roberto wants to immediately fight back, but Gideon holds him back. Gideon kept his power a secret, preferring to work behind the scenes had him wait and see how things play out.{{r|X-Force # 1}}{{r|X-Force # 3}}{{r|Spider-Man #16}}{{r|X-Force # 4}}

After a while, Cable and the X-Force show up and Black Tom blows up the building. Gideon and Roberto emerge from the rubble and, after an altercation with Cable, decide to help the trapped people. As Gable's group and a newly arrived [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] dealt with Black Tome and the Jaggernaut. Once the authorities arrive, Gideon lies to the news outlets that yes Black Tom and the Juggernaut were responsible for the initial takeover, but it's obvious the events were masterminded by Cable. That it would be the betterment of the World for Cable and his band to be stopped.{{r|Spider-Man #16}}{{r|X-Force # 4}}{{r|X-Force # 5}}

===Sympathy for the Devil===
Gideon managed to keep his power a secret for a long time, however, the New Warriors, when investigating criminal links of the Taylor Foundation, caused Gideon to reveal his mutant powers and sadistic temperament. He soundly defeated them.{{r|New Warriors #18}}{{r|New Warriors #19}}

===The Gathering===
[[File:High Lords (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 1 10 001.png|thumb|400x400px]]When Cannonball was killed by [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]] and came back to life shortly after, Gideon and the other Externals sensed his ascension to their numbers. Gideon joined his fellow High Lords at meet [[Nicodemus (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Nicodemus]], [[Garbha-Hsien (Earth-616)|Saul]], [[Absalom (Earth-616)|Absalom]] and [[Burke (Earth-616)|Burke]] at Nicodemus' Nicodemus Chalet in the [[Swiss Alps]] of [[Switzerland]], to discuss this new revelation.{{r|X-Force #9}}{{r|X-Force #10}}

Though Absalom, who already disliked Gideon, was made more so by the time Gideon wasted on recruiting the wrong person, they listened to Gideon’s plan to unleash fellow High Lord [[Crule (Earth-616)|Krule]] to kill the X-Force leader Cable. Despite them being shocked Gideon involve Krule, and [[Burke (Earth-616)|Burke’s]] concerns that his plan would only lead Cable, who was aware of Gideon being an External right to them or [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Xavier]], his [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] or X-Force. Saul and Nicodemus allowed him to go through with his plan.{{r|X-Force #8}}{{r|X-Force #10}}

====When Externals Clash====
[[File:Gideon (Earth-616) vs Crule (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 1 12 001.png|left|thumb]]
Knowing where Crule would be, Gideon headed to a bar in [[Lowtown (Madripoor)|Lowtown]] [[Madripoor]], an [[Asian]] city-island not far off the coast of [[China]]. Once there he found Crule enjoying a drink after he proceeded to destroy the bar and the people for catching the dealer of the poker cheating. When he confronted him, Crule not one to deny his inherent tendency’s and love of violence, along with a half century of hate between them attacked Gideon. At first Crule proved the better of the two, that is by using his ability to masterly duplicate the abilities and powers of others{{r|New Warriors #19}}{{r|X-Force #2}} Gideon soundly beat Crule.{{r|X-Force #12}}

Gideon filled Crule in on his plan to rid them of Cable, the newest ascended Cannonball and things which pertain to the ascension of the Externals. Together they went to Gideon’s penthouse apartment above the main administrative offices of [[Ophrah Industries]] in [[Denver]]. Crule though wanting to tar Roberto Da Costa apart upon meeting but Gideon, still affected by his coping of Crule, savagely beat Roberto to unconsciousness instead.{{r|X-Force #12}}

====To the Pain====
The desert of [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]], Ophrah Research Facility, Gideon had Sunspot sent for his lead scientists [[Segismund Joshua (Earth-616)|Dr. Joshua]], Dr. Leah and others as a test subject for his solar absorption machine. They feel that their solar absorption machine is going to kill Sunspot. They question if they should bring up their concerns to Gideon and choose to proceed instead.{{r|X-Force #13|14}}

When Gideon learns that Crule didn't kill Cable but went off the plan and after Cannonball instead, and failed he reached out to him. As Cannonball and his team headed across the Colorado Rockies to Gideon's home, Gideon done deal with Cannonball. That he will tell Sam where Roberto is, if he promised to never again interfere in matters concerning the Externals. Cannonball begrudgingly accepted.{{r|X-Force #15}}

===Four Control===
With both controlling shareholders of Taylor Foundation, [[Tai (Well of All Things) (Earth-616)|Tai]] died and [[Andrew Chord (Earth-616)|Chord]] incapacitated, the business was in a state of flux.{{r|Night Thrasher: Four Control #1}} As such Gideon began a hostile takeover starting with GeneTech, who was supported by Tai and Chord. Gideon had Taylor Foundation board member [[Gai No Don (Earth-616)|Gai No Don]] working for him and his operative [[Eve (Gideon) (Earth-616)|Eve Magdalene]], who acted as a board member for Taylor Foundation and proxy for Ophrah Industries ready.{{r|Night Thrasher: Four Control #2}}{{r|Night Thrasher: Four Control #3}}

When Chord faked his kidnapping, because if anyone had him, they will have Taylor Foundation, [[Dwayne Taylor (Earth-616)|Tayler]] as Night Thrasher began investigating. As he did Taylor learned the state his company was really in, of Gideon's operative Eve being a [[Life-Model Decoy|Life-Model Decoy]]. Gideon also went to Genetech and was trying to buy out the company and as a result, the Taylor Foundation. Gideon had Eve replaced ahead of the board with another of his employees [[Evelyn Crawford (Earth-616)|Evelyn Crawford]], but when Taylor took over the meeting, Gideon stepped in to turn the tide in his favor. After some heated words, it was left up to the stockholders of Ophrah and GeneTech to decide. With Taylor beating out Gideon by 3 votes, the both decided to finish this in a more personal way.{{r|Night Thrasher: Four Control #2}}{{r|Night Thrasher: Four Control #3}}

Gideon waited for Taylor at his mountain chalet in [[Vail]], [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]], when Taylor appeared Gideon having mimicked his Night Thrasher's armor saw through his camouflage and attacked. The two crashed into Gideon's home, but before they could continue Taylor challenge Gideon to a straight on fight without his armor. He had the upper hand at first, but Taylor manage to beat him. With Gideon unconscious, Taylor hacked into his computer to learn that Gai No Don was working for Gideon also. Getting what he needed he uploaded a prepared virus to crash the system, so Gideon couldn't try anything like this again.{{r|Night Thrasher: Four Control #3}}

===A New Threat===
[[File:Gideon (Earth-616) and Garbha-Hsien (Earth-616) from X-Force Vol 1 23 001.png|left|thumb|290x290px]]When [[Nathan Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]] tricked [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Sinister]] into unleashing his [[Legacy Virus]] the Externals found that they were not even safe.{{r|X-Force #18}}{{r|X-Force #20}}

With the Legacy Virus having claimed Nicodemus, Gideon and Saul came up with a plan to trick Cannonball into coming to them. Saul went to [[Camp Verde]] in [[Arizona (State)|Arizona]] where X-Force had their base, there he found [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]], [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom-Boom]] and [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] alone. From the shadows Saul blasted them with a form of electrical force that left the three unconscious. He brought them to his home on the [[Oregon (State)|North Oregon]] coastline and with each secured to a rock on the cliff near the ocean's water and near drowning, he and Saul sent Cannonball via hologram the massage of their captives.{{r|X-Force #20}}{{r|X-Force #21}}{{r|X-Force #22}}

But unbeknownst to them X-Force instead located Crule at [[St. Anthony's Hospital]] in [[Portland]] [[Maine (State)|Maine]], with Cannonball stays behind the others got a still in a body cast Crule. As Gideon and Saul discuss what the loss of Nicodemus and what the ascension of their newest External Cannonball means, Crule wanting to humble his fellow High Lords gladly gave them up to X-Force. While Gideon and Saul drank tea X-Force in their [[IPAC]] came crashing through the side of Saul house sending them flying. With their teammates free as [[Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse)|Shatterstar]] and [[Maria Callasantos (Earth-616)|Feral]] keeping guard, as Gideon gloated, thinking their plan worked Sunspot showed Gideon the letter from Cannonball that they plan to get him to break their deal failed. As they left Saul pleaded that they needed to study the newest ascendant, for without Sam Guthrie the Externals may all die. But to no avail, instead he was left with a warning to cease harassing them or he would suffer that fate anyway.{{r|X-Force #23}}

===Revelations===
When [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron von Strucker]] learned of the immortal External Gideon and his quest for power, which he felt was rightfully his, he sends his [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hyrda]] agents. Lead by [[Cassandra Romulus (Earth-616)|Cassandra Romulus]] to either bring Gideon in as one of his or to die before him.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 #46}}

At his [[Ophrah Industries]] office in [[Denver]], Gideon greeted Crule, not surprised that he did not perish after his battle with X-Force.{{r|X-Force #15}} Though complementing Crule on his bones knitting quickly and there will be consequences, possible to do with Crule's failure, when Hydra smashed through the window. Gideon tells  Crule to stay at ease, for he can handle them without his help. But when Romulus offered Gideon a place in Hydra or die, Crule, finding the offer of a High Lord a subservient position in an inferior organization backed by idle threats an insult and attacked. As they fought [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Fury]] along with [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, thanks to [[George Washington Bridge (Earth-616)|G.W. Bridge]]'s who learned of the Hydra's plan, appeared and immediately attacked them.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 #46}}

Gideon not wanting to be in S.H.I.E.L.D.s debt called on Crule to attack both intruder, which Crule was more than happy to comply. As the three sides fought Fury asked Gideon to call off Crule, that he was only there for Hydra. But Gideon didn't trust him, revealing that he knew of S.H.I.E.L.D.s spies infiltrating his business interests past and present for some time. With Hydra defeated, and Gideon warning Fury if his agents did stop pointing their guns at him he will be force to teach them a lesson. Knowing Gideon is no friend to Hydra agrees to leave him be, but Crule wants more, Gideon not wanting further engagements is forced to strike Crule.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 #46}}{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 #47}}

With Romulus and Hydra taken prisoner, Gideon leaves Fury with a warning to not interfere in his affairs again or it will not end as civil. Which Fury agrees to that, but wasn't there for him, that day.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 #47}}

===The Tithing===
Gideon joined fellow External Candra at her home in [[Paris]], and enjoyed a romantic time together well her Tithing is underway for the Guilds of New Orleans. The extent of their partnership is unknown. However, the night was cut short when a dying [[Bella Donna Boudreaux (Earth-616)|Bella's]] brother [[Julien Boudreaux (Earth-616)|Julien]] failed to use [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] to get Candra's Elixir to save Bella. Sent his men to steal the Elixir from Candra's [[Tithe Collector (Earth-616)|Tithe Collector]], but he managed to escape and went to Paris to warn Candra interrupting their night.{{r|Gambit #1|3}}

With a blooding out Tithe Collector on her couch and the night ruined, Gideon chose to get back to handling business of his own left. But Candra would rather deal with her own affairs, especially knowing Gambit was coming for the Elixir.{{r|Gambit #2}}

===Searching for Hope===
For a time he and the others stayed away from Cannonball and his X-Force, until Burke and Absalom became infected by the Legacy Virus which would take Burke's life first. But not before Burke, through his precognitive skills, saw and made the others aware that Samuel Guthrie was the architect of their salvation.{{r|X-Force #37}}

Along with Absalom and Saul, Gideon went to [[Cumberland County]], [[Kentucky (State)|Kentucky]], to meet with Samuel, threatening his brother [[Joshua Guthrie (Earth-616)|Josh]]. There to convince Samuel to aid them, they discussed with Samuel and Tabitha of their defining moments of their ascension from mortals to something more, they told him about what each of them represent, which for Gideon was Opportunity and Samuel that was Hope. After Samuel shared heartfelt words with them and how they could have made a difference, but did nothing Absalom, who had lost his temper once already with Samuel but was put in his place by Gideon now raged.{{r|X-Force #36}}{{r|X-Force #37}}

He assaulted Gideon and then as the virus overwhelm him Samuel saved the others with his blast field from the explosion. Gideon was amazed to find Absalom survived, which Saul believed it was a testament to the truth of Samuel's words. So with Samuel's word that as long as they try to do better with what they got and if the time comes, if he is able to he will save their lives, with Gideon carrying an unconscious Absalom they left.{{r|X-Force #37}}

===Even an X-Ternal Can Die!===
Surprisingly, Gideon sent a distress call to X-Force after being betrayed by the External Selene. For reasons of her own, Selene was suddenly killing the remaining members of the Externals, absorbing their life forces. Despite the efforts of X-Force, Gideon was the first External to be killed by [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]] when she drained him of his life energy.{{r|X-Force #52}}

===The Newer Mutants===
His remains were taken by his assistants of Ophrah Industries to sit and gestate in a containment capsule at Black Canyon, Gunnison National Park. Cable and his team eventually came looking for Gideon when Externals started dying left and right. A future version of [[Gideon (Earth-18352)|Gideon]] (from thousands of years later after delaying his recovery) was responsible for the murders, and defended his present self's recovery.{{r|Cable #152|153}}

===Krakoa===
Gideon was seen healthy again and living in [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] as a member of the new mutant nation. He was seen alongside many other Krakoans onlooking at Charles Xavier corpse after his death at the hands of anti-mutant super-human criminals whom had somehow infiltrated Krakoa's defenses and killed many of its residents, including Xavier.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 2}}

| Powers                  = '''Immortal:''' As an External, Gideon is effectively immortal and since becoming active after his first death he no longer ages. So despite being more than 500 years of age, he retained the appearance and vigor of a man in his physical prime.{{r|X-Force #37}}{{r|Cable #153}} Though Gideon can be put out of commission or seemingly destroyed for various periods of time, he can not be killed.{{r|X-Force #52|53}}{{r|Cable #154}}
* '''''Rapid Healing:''''' As part of his own natural genetic mutation, Gideon is ability to endure injuries (within unknown limits) without lasting harm or seemingly feeling much pain{{r|New Warriors #19}}, he could apparently regenerate injured or missing cells from even near-fatal injuries.{{r|X-Force #3}}{{r|New Warriors #19}} However, Gideon could fully regenerated such tissue by temporarily absorbing the abilities of a being that possessed a sufficiently developed healing factor.
* '''''Resurrection:''''' As an immortal, Gideon has shown to be able to resurrect himself from death.{{r|X-Force #52}}{{r|Cable #152|153}}

'''Psychic-Link:''' As an Extertal, he shares a telepathic-link with his fellow Externals that allows them to not only sense each other and where, but can call on each other at will from great distances.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 12}} He is also able to sense when one rises from their first death and when one is killed by another External.{{r|X-Force #10}}{{r|X-Force #37}}{{r|Cable #152}}{{r|Cable #153}}{{r|Cable #154}}

'''Power Mimicry:''' Gideon possess the ability of Super Human Enhancement Assimilation: the power to temporarily endow himself with the super powers of any beings in his proximity, whether they are a superhuman, android, or mechanical battlesuit. He scans and replicates his target's energy signatures and genetic templates, granting him a full understanding of the potential applications of the powers he acquires and enabling him to overwhelm an opponent with a superior mastery of their own powers.{{r|New Mutants #98}}{{r|New Warriors #19}}
* While he assumed the powers of others, he doesn't take on any aspect of their appearance (for instance, he duplicated [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Speedball's]] Kinetic Energy Field without needing to increase his height or mass as Speedball needed).{{r|New Warriors #19}}
* Gideon has also shown not only to mimic the advanced skills, talents and powers of a subject but that of three subjects at once so far.{{r|New Warriors #19}}{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 46|47}}

| Notes                   = * Gideon was Christian, at least in 1492.{{r|X-Force #37}}
* Early ancillary media surrounding Gideon listed him as a member of different teams. The {{cl|Gamer's Handbook of the Marvel Universe #8}} identified him as a member of the [[Upstarts (Earth-616)|Upstarts]]. (Presumably, this is because his murder of Black Rook Emmanuel Dacosta seemed linked to the other attacks on Hellfire Club members by Upstarts in the same year.) Marvel Universe Series III 1992 trading cards called him a member of the "Profit$". Whether this was an pre-production name for the Upstarts or the Externals is unknown.
