| History                 = Charlie was one of the first thieves caught by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] after a robbery in an isolated warehouse.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #3}}

A while later, Charlie and a few other punks were seen casing a jewelry store by Spider-Man, who webbed them up before they could rob it. However, Charlie threatened to sue Spider-Man for assault and battery; forcing him to flee when they called the cops, since all the evidence made him look guilty.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #4}}

After robbing a bank, Charlie and his gang confronted [[Gunther Bain (Earth-616)|Unus the Untouchable]].{{r|X-Men #8}}

A short time later, Charlie encountered again Spider-Man when he was looking for the [[ISO-36]] stolen by the [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Master Planner]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #32}}

He later refused to give any information to [[Frederick Foswell (Earth-616)|Patch]], being an informant.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #37}}

Spidey met Charlie again with other thugs in a private club which they were racketeering. During the fight, Charlie threw him some kind of miniaturized grenade that stunned Spidey and let them escape.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #51}}

Sometime later, together with [[Character Index/E#Eddie|Big Eddie]] and [[Character Index/R#Rocky|Rocky]], Charlie was caught stealing fur coats by [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]], who defeated them and delivered them to the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|police]].{{r|Avengers #59}}

A short time later, while Charlie and other fellow criminals were talking about hiring [[Wilbur Day (Earth-616)|Stilt-Man]] to kill [[Franklin Nelson (Earth-616)|Foggy Nelson]] before his D.A. election, they were attacked by [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] and were forced to escape by car.{{r|Daredevil #48}}

Charlie continued his criminal career for several years. During that time, he was apprehended by Spider-Man four more times. Each time, Spider-Man did not recognize Charlie as someone he had captured before.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 38}}

[[File:Charles_Buchanan_(Earth-616)_from_Spider-Man_Vol_1_39_0001.jpg|thumb|left|Charlie as '''Crook-Man'''.]]
One day, Charlie was mugging an elderly man at the [[Top of New York]] hotel (by pretending to have a gun), when he was interrupted by Spider-Man. Charlie ran, but Spider-Man was not able to immediately follow because another emergency came up. Spider-Man searched for Charlie later in the day, but could not find him. The very next day, Charlie attempted a purse snatching, only to be stopped by Spider-Man again. Spider-man still did not recognize Charlie, despite searching for him the day before. Charlie tried to escape by threatening Spider-Man with an unloaded gun, but Spider-Man knocked Charlie out and webbed him up for the police. Charlie came to and the webbing dissolved before the police arrived, so Charlie escaped.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 38}}

[[File:Sarah_Klein_(Earth-616)_and_Charles_Buchanan_(Earth-616)_from_Spider-Man_Vol_1_40_0001.jpg|thumb|left|Charlie saves Sarah.]]
The next day, a discouraged Charlie decided to try one last big score before retiring from crime for good.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 39}} He designed a costume that included a fake explosive belt, and using the name Crook-Man he interrupted a charity gala at the Top of New York and threatened to trigger his explosives unless everyone turned over their valuables. Spider-Man arrived, and, knowing the explosives were fake thanks to his spider-sense, confronted Crook-Man. However, they were interrupted by an explosion on the roof of the hotel and a black-out, both caused by Spider-man's foe [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]]. Spider-Man left to take care of Electro, and in the ensuing panic, Charlie was able to ditch his Crook-Man costume and then save [[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Daily Bugle]]'s publicist [[Sarah Klein (Earth-616)|Sarah Klein]] from being trampled by the crowd. Hailed as a hero (and unrecognized as Crook-Man by anyone), Charlie was rewarded with a front page at the Bugle by [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]].{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 40}}
