The Secret Empire began as a branch of [[THEM (Earth-616)|THEM]] (itself a subsidiary of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]){{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 149}} with its original purpose being to divert the attention of authorities such as [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] away from Hydra's activities.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 11}} Following the first death of [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron von Strucker]],{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 158}} the Secret Empire gained independence from Hydra.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 1}}

Members of the Secret Empire are given a numerical codename that designates their rank within the organization.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 11}} The Secret Empire is headed by a nine person council made up of the highest ranking members called the Council of Nine with [[Number One]] serving as the supreme leader.{{Citation}}
===Early Activities===
[[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]] was hired by the Secret Empire to steal plans for the Air Force's Orion Missile, but he was defeated by the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]. The organization also simultaneously fought [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]]. It was also around this time that S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Gabriel Jones (Earth-616)|Gabe Jones]] went undercover as Number Nine and eliminated every member of the Council of Nine save for [[Number One (Secret Empire 1) (Earth-616)|Number One]] himself.

Shortly there after, Number One accidentally killed himself in an attempt to blow up the Hulk.{{r|Tales to Astonish Vol 1 81|85}}
===The Coming of The Griffin===
[[John Horton (Earth-616)|Johnny Horton]] was captured by agents of the the Secret Empire. They assigned a surgeon in its employ to transform Horton into a superhuman being by using various techniques, including grafting wings and claws onto Horton's body permanently and administering an experimental mutagenic serum into him. Horton was named the Griffin after his new appearance, which vaguely resembled the mythological griffin, a creature that was half lion and half eagle.{{r|Amazing Adventures Vol 2 15}}

===High Political Office===
The Secret Empire kidnapped [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]], [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Mastermind]], [[Mesmero (Vincent) (Earth-616)|Mesmero]], [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]], and [[Gunther Bain (Earth-616)|Unus the Untouchable]] to order to harness their energy to power a "flying saucer".

The new [[Richard Nixon (Earth-616)|Number One]] landed the saucer on the [[White House]] lawn and demanded the government surrender control to him or he would detonate nukes in every major American city. The Secret Empire was defeated by Captain America, [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], the [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]], and [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]]. Captain America then pursued Number One through the White House before finally cornering him in the Oval Office. Number One unmasked himself, revealing himself to be a very high ranking U.S. government official{{r|Although his identity and face are never revealed, it is strongly implied in the dialog that Number One was Richard Nixon, the [[President of the United States of America]] at the time.}} attempting a coup d'état. Rather than face capture he then committed suicide. This led to Steve Rogers giving up his role as Captain America for a while and taking on the mantle of [[Nomad]].{{r|Captain America Vol 1 #169|175}}{{r|Captain America Vol 1 180}}

Later, [[Anthony Power (Earth-616)|Professor Power]] became the new Number One. He sought to trigger a nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] defeated Professor Power and the Secret Empire, as well as their agents [[Robert Baxter (Earth-616)|Mad Dog]] and [[Mutant Force (Earth-616)|Mutant Force]].{{r|Defenders Vol 1 #123|130}}

===Moon Knight and Midnight===
The Secret Empire also sought to eliminate [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]], who they believed had disrupted some of their operations. The real guilty party was Moon Knight's sidekick [[Jeffrey Wilde (Earth-616)|Midnight]]. When Moon Knight and his sidekick confronted the Secret Empire, Midnight was hit by an energy blast from the group's new leader, the mysterious [[Secret Empire (Earth-616)/Members#Number Seven|Number 7]]. Moon Knight abandoned his sidekick, believing that he was dead but in truth he was still alive, though horrifically disfigured and maimed.{{r|Marc Spector: Moon Knight Vol 1 17|18}} Number 7 ordered Midnight transformed into a cyborg, with his hatred for Moon Knight (for being abandoned by his mentor) and a mechanical failsafe that caused him to suffer intense pain if he disobeyed Number 7.{{r|Marc Spector: Moon Knight Vol 1 19|20}}

Midnight was sent out on his first mission: kidnap the super-hero [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] so that the Secret Empire could transform him into a cyborg as well. The plan was foiled by the combination of Nova, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], Moon Knight, [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]], and [[Dwayne Taylor (Earth-616)|Night Thrasher]]. During the battle, the Secret Empire nurse assigned to provide repair work towards Midnight's robotic body parts disabled Number 7's failsafe, allowing Midnight to kill Number 7 and assume control over the Secret Empire. However, along the way it was revealed that his nurse (and now lover), [[Lynn Church (Earth-616)|Lynn Church]], was a cyborg as well.{{r|Marc Spector: Moon Knight Vol 1 21|22}} A loyal follower of the original founder (the original Number 1), she served as a prototype for the process used to transform Midnight into a half-human, half-machine being that he became, to the extent that she allowed herself to be disfigured and maimed to facilitate her transformation into becoming a cyborg. The realization that his lover was insane caused Midnight to aid his mentor and his allies against Church, ultimately sacrificing his life to destroy her.{{r|Marc Spector: Moon Knight Vol 1 23|24}}
===Dead Man's Hand===
The Secret Empire would later be part of a conspiracy to divide up the empire of [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Wilson Fisk]]. The meeting took place in [[Las Vegas]], under the cover of a Secret Empire 'convention'. Many Secret Empire members simply believed it was a fraternal organization like the Masons or the Elks Club, which was a perfect cover for criminal enterprises. The [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] got wind of this right away and the Empire sent two hit squads to attack him.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 45}} 

The various warlords who attend the meeting began attacking each other nearly right away. [[Mickey Fondozzi (Earth-616)|Mickey Fondozzi]] and [[David Lieberman (Earth-616)|Microchip]], associates of the Punisher, had been captured while spying on [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron von Strucker]], and claimed to be Number Four and Number Eight, members of the Secret Empire. The Empire learned of this via a spy in Hydra. By coincidence, the real Four and Eight had not actually traveled to Las Vegas and this was enough to convince the others they had turned traitor. The Empire sent the [[Praetorian Guard (Earth-616)|Praetorian Guard]] to kill everyone involved, but Mickey, Micro and Strucker all survived.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 309}} Further encounters led to no progress at all and the Secret Empire members left Las Vegas. The Empire's plans came under the scrutiny of the 'Favor Broker', an opponent of [[Jack Monroe (Earth-616)|Nomad]].{{r|Nomad Vol 2 #4|6}} He teamed up with the Punisher and [[Matthew Murdoch (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] in an attempt to disrupt the meeting.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 307|308}} All they managed to do is kill some lackeys, [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] ninjas, and capture the [[Ulysses Lugman (Earth-616)|Slug]].{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 #46|47}}

Some time later, agents of the Secret Empire battled [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]],{{r|Hawkeye Vol 2 #1|3}} the vigilante group known as The [[Jury (Earth-616)|Jury]],{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 34}} and a new [[Rebecca Barnes (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Nomad]].{{r|Nomad: Girl Without a World Vol 1 2|4}}{{r|Captain America Vol 1 602|605}} The Secret Empire also sent agents to kill [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] with hopes of claiming a billion dollar bounty.{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 #1|3}}

===Omega Effect===
The Secret Empire, along with [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], [[Black Spectre (Criminal Organization) (Earth-616)|Black Spectre]], and [[Agence Byzantine (Earth-616)|Agence Byzantine]] negotiated a deal with [[Midas Investments (Earth-616)|Midas Investments]] to incorporate their various shell companies through [[Latveria]]. This would have made it impossible for the law to prove that any of these companies were connected to a terrorist organization.{{r|Daredevil Vol 3 5}} To make sure the deal went smoothly Midas created the [[Omegadrive]] as a leverage point. Made from a discarded piece of a [[Fantastic Four Uniforms]], the Omegadrive contained billions of gigs of data about the five cartels.

During a meeting of representatives of the five organizations [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] stole the Omegadrive. The five cartels then entered into an agreement to retrieve the drive, as it was much too valuable for any one of them to obtain on their own.{{r|Daredevil Vol 3 6}} Unknown to the other four, Black Spectre had hired [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] to steal the drive. During another meeting of representatives Daredevil revealed that he had leaked all of Black Spectre's data to the the authorities and that, an hour prior, Black Spectre had disbanded. In retaliation the representatives of the Secret Empire, Hydra, A.I.M., and Agence Byzantine killed the representative from Black Spectre.{{r|Daredevil Vol 3 10.1}}
