The '''Outriders''' is a race of genetically engineered humanoid creatures with the purpose of serving their maker until they die.

[[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] used Outriders to find new planets inhabited by weak species he would raze.

After finding a new planet called [[Ahl-Agullo]], one Outrider was tasked by Glaive to continue with his mission. He found [[Earth]], and gathered different information about the situation of this world using his telepathy on numerous important inhabitants{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2013 Infinity}} such as [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] king [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]], who ripped off one of his four arms after discovering him; however, he was still able to get away. When he relayed back the information to Thanos, such as the Earth heroes the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] leaving the planet, Corvus gave him his reward: death.{{r|Infinity Vol 1 1}}

| Trivia                  = * When designing the Outriders for ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', [[Marvel Studios]] found itself concerned that the creatures too closely resembled another Marvel Comics property, [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom]], which didn't have the rights of.

* Although non-canon, the [[Earth-199999|Marvel Cinematic Universe]]-based book ''[[w:c:mcu:Thanos: Titan Consumed|Thanos: Titan Consumed]]'' explains that the Outriders are a result of [[Thanos (Earth-199999)|Thanos]] combining samples of DNA from the [[Chitauri]], himself, and of various species that he killed.
