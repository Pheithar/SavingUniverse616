| History                 = Richard Parker was born and raised in [[Queens]], [[New York City]]. He lived there with his older brother [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|Ben Parker]]. Richard was recruited into the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] by [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] Richard married another agent, [[Mary Parker (Earth-616)|Mary Fitzpatrick]], and the two of them had a son, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]], and a daughter, [[Teresa Parker (Earth-616)|Teresa Parker]],{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 302}} though the later was born in secret.

At an unknown point, Richard and Mary found the parts of [[Master Matrix (Earth-616)|Master Matrix]], an advanced [[Life-Model Decoy]] capable of controlling other LMDs, in a [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] weapons depot on an uncharted island. They rebuilt him, but Mary believed that Matrix was alive and that [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] should set him free.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 33}}

While Peter was still an infant, Richard and Mary were assigned to infiltrate the [[Algeria|Algerian]]-based spy ring controlled by the Communist agent, the [[Albert Malik (Earth-616)|Red Skull]]. The moment the Red Skull learned that Richard and Mary Parker were double agents, he had them killed by one of his agents, the [[Karl Fiers (Earth-616)|Finisher]], in an airplane crash overseas, and framed for treason.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #5}} While Richard and Mary were on assignment, Ben and his wife [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|May]] took care of Peter. Ben and May had never had children of their own, but after Richard and Mary died, they became Peterâ€™s surrogate parents and raised him as if he were their own son.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel Vol 1 46}}
