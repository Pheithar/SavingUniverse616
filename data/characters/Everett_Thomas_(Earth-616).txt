===Origin===
Everett Thomas was a [[Homo superior|mutant]] born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri (State)|Missouri]]. He possessed an aura which allowed him to synch up with other superhumans in his immediate vicinity, thereby briefly gaining any powers they possessed.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #36}}

===Phalanx===
The mechanical collective race known as the [[Phalanx]] had assimilated the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and attempted to wipe out what was to be the next generation of mutant heroes: ([[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]], [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]], [[Claudette and Nicole St. Croix (Earth-616)|M]], and [[Clarice Ferguson (Earth-616)|Blink]]). Synch had accidentally synched to [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], who was in the area, and had shattered all the windows nearby with Banshee's "borrowed" scream. He didn't understand how he did it, but the next thing he knew there was a slew of police officers with guns pointed at him. Unfortunately for them, the menace wasn't Everett, but the Phalanx, who attacked the officers. Luckily, he was saved thanks to the help of [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]], Banshee, and Jubilee. This misfit band of heroes ended up saving the other kids who were attacked by the Phalanx and, thanks with the sacrifice of Blink, they managed to escape.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #36|37}}

===Generation X===
[[File:Everett Thomas (Earth-616) from Generation X Vol 1 6 001.jpg|150px|thumb|left]]
Following the end of the Phalanx crisis, Everett and the other youths were all relocated to the [[Massachusetts Academy]], where they trained to use their powers, received a formal education, and acted as the next generation of X-Men, [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 318}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 1}} During his time with Gen X, he was briefly transformed into a voracious parasitic mutant by the team's arch-nemesis [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]] who wanted to destroy Synch's happy family life. Under Emplate's influence, Synch menaced his family and friends until M, who he had difficulty synching with, was able to defeat him.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 14|16}}

When Emma Frost's sister, [[Adrienne Frost (Earth-616)|Adrienne]], returned to America, she forced Emma to re-accept her as Headmistress. If not, Adrienne would release information to the parents of the normal kids that the Xavier School For Gifted Youngsters was a secret training ground for mutants.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 68}} During this time, Synch began a relationship with [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]] and became one of the few people she would open up to.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 67|70}} Later, Adrienne stirred up mutant hatred amongst the human students in the school. When the parents of the non-mutant students heard that their children were going to school with mutants, they all arrived together to take them away from the academy. However, Adrienne Frost had also planted bombs all around the school.<!--{{r|Generation X Vol 1 70}}-->

When Banshee and Synch set out to turn off and deactivate all the bombs while Emma and Adrienne fought, Synch found a bomb with too many human students nearby. He tried to "synch" with the nearest mutant, Monet, however, she was too far away, so he only received a portion of her powers. Using all his might, he threw the human kids out of the room, saving them from the explosion. Sadly, he wasn't able to save himself, dying to save his human peers.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 70}}

===Necrosha===
Synch was many years later among the many mutants temporarily resurrected by [[Eliphas (Earth-616)|Eli Bard]]'s [[Transmode Virus]] to serve as part of Selene's army of undead mutants.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 22}}

===Dawn of X===
Synch was one of the earliest resurrected mutants by the hand of the [[Five (Earth-616)|Five]], due to the fact that it was believed that his powers could enable him to act as a substitute for any of the Five who might need one. [[Angelo Espinosa (Earth-616)|Skin]] was resurrected ahead of his scheduled time to serve as a companion for Synch, as they came from similar backgrounds and time periods.<!--{{r|X-Men Vol 5 5}}-->

Since they could survive the temporal changes of that place together, Synch, [[Armando Muñoz (Earth-616)|Darwin]], and [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|Wolverine (Laura)]] were picked to capture [[Serafina (Earth-616)|Serafina]] by entering The Vault, a place where anyone trapped inside could remain there for subjectively thousands of years. Unfortunately, as soon as the three entered the Vault, they lost touch with the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 5}}

During their first day, while engaging the [[Children of the Vault (Earth-616)|Children of the Vault]] in battle, Ev discovered that his power now allowed him to synch with non-mutants. With this revelation, he duplicated the [[Homo novissima|Post-Human]] [[Fuego (Earth-616)|Fuego]]'s pyrokinesis, and incinerated some of them. After seeing her teammates killed, [[Aguja (Earth-616)|Aguja]] angrily killed herself by projecting a force field that destroyed everything around her in an attempt to kill her foes.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 18}}

However, Synch and his teammates recovered, with Synch copying Wolverine's healing factor. The team then spent 100 years inside the Vault gathering intelligence on the Children. Synch used Wolverine's healing factor to slow his aging and learned that City could resurrect any Children that were killed through cloning in order to continuously evolve them. Synch and Wolverine also became romantically involved. When Wolverine and Darwin were captured, Synch fled the Vault since he could no longer rely on Wolverine's longevity powers to slow his aging. After waiting a week outside, Synch returned to the Vault, where 100 years had past. Synch rescued Wolverine but was unable to save Darwin, who got killed by the City to help develop a new generation of Children. The couple then attempted to leave the Vault, but Wolverine had to stand behind to hold off the Children while Synch fled outside. Synch was eventually killed by the Children, but managed to make telepathic contact with [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|X]] and ensure everything he'd learned about the Vault was passed onto his resurrected form. Wolverine and Darwin were also resurrected, but neither had the memories of their time in the Vault, leaving Synch with the burden of remembering their time together all alone.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 19}}

At the [[Hellfire Gala]], Laura and Ev were among the elected to join the new X-Men roster.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 21}} Cyclops created a new base for this team in a lot of land Emma had purchased for them in Central Park and 86th Street, turning it into a park that was a celebration of mutant accomplishment and a memorial for mutants such as Thunderbird, who couldn’t be revived. In this park, he had Krakoa and Forge create a techno-organic [[Treehouse]] for the team to operate in and, unlike the other Krakoan gates and embassies, this area was free to visit by humans and mutants.{{r|X-Men Vol 6 1}}

After forming, this team fought off two alien attacks: one by the [[Mind Reaver (Earth-616)|Mind Reaver]] in Manhattan, the other by the Annihilation Wave in Kansas. This was the work of the intergalactic crime lord [[Cordyceps Jones (Earth-616)|Cordyceps Jones]] who had been running bets on who could destroy the Earth first on his casino [[Gameworld]].{{r|X-Men Vol 6 1|2}}

| Powers                  = '''Synchronistic Power Replication''': He possesses an aura that allows him to be "in synch" with other superhumans in his immediate vicinity, thereby gaining any powers they possess.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 18}} The powers Everett "synchs" will fade if the superhuman he is "in synch" with leaves the vicinity.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 70}} When Synch uses his powers, a multi-colored aura appears around his body. The aura is caused by the energies he is absorbing splitting the ambient light around him, which causes the described effect.{{citation}} Synch doesn't need just a physical person to copy powers. Tissue samples from superhumans are enough for him to copy their powers.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 19}}

In a number of cases his manifestation of their powers may be more powerful or versatile, such as flight while synched with [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]]{{r|Generation X Vol 1 49}}{{r|Generation X Vol 1 52}} or his aura becoming a protective shield while syncing [[Hollow (Earth-616)|Penance]].{{citation}}

*'''''Aura Tracking''''': He was able to track other mutants by allowing his aura to lock on to a mutant's biosignature, and the aura extends in the general direction in which the mutant is located.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 6}}

It has been theorized that, with practice, Synch will be able to permanently retain the powers and abilities he acquired.{{citation}}

With his recent resurrection on Krakoa, he has seemingly transcended his past limitations. He has grown in power, and moved on from only absorbing mutant powers, but to all beings' powers. Everett has also synched his powers with others without having his aura visible.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 18}}

| Notes                   = * On one occasion Synch apparently duplicated [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]'s powers when both were exposed to a mutagenic pollen from [[Samuel Smithers (Earth-616)|Plantman]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #437}} This seems to be the only instance of him syncing with a non-mutant until his resurrection by the Five.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 18}}
* He was also able to synch with [[Gaia (Earth-616)|Gaia]],{{r|Generation X #38}} a mutant but not necessarily a human one.
* While he was dead, [[Sofia Mantega (Earth-616)|Sofia Mantega]] suggested he was the new Night Thrasher.{{r|New Warriors Vol 4 10}}
* After the resurrection, he seems to be more flexible to the idea of killing, as he killed a couple of Post-Humans.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 18}}
| Trivia                  = * Ev was a great fan of [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] and [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]].{{r|Generation X Vol 1 59}}
