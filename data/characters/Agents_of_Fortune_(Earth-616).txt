| HistoryText             = The Agents of Fortune are members of a cult dedicated to the rebirth of an ancient demon race on Earth. They were led by [[Vera Gemini (Earth-616)|Vera Gemini]], who was the daughter of a human and a demon. Eric Simon Payne, aka [[Eric Payne (Earth-616)|Devil-Slayer]], was once a member of the Agents of Fortune, but quit. He would later return to battle the organization.{{r|Marvel Spotlight Vol 1 33}} The [[Agent of Fortune (Earth-616)|Agent of Fortune]] stole the [[Amulet of Agamotto]] from [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] as a part of this plot. The [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] succeeded in defeating them.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 58|60}}

The human members of the Cult lusted for power, but they were unwitting pawns of their leader Vera Gemini. They were offered as human sacrifice to the [[Demons]]. When they managed to summon many demons to Earth, they were brutally slain by the Demons.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 60}}
