| History                 = Calizuma and his warrior wizards found a valley in the [[Himalayas]] and altered their appearance to seem as man-apes, to attract there the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]]. While he thought he was teaching them, they were subtly penetrating and controlling his mind, in order for him to serve the [[Undying Ones]]. Calizuma was eventually defeated by the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]], who took him down by striking him with all their power at once.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 #2}}
