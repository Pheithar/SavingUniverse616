| History                 = Charles Dalton was a member of the [[MI13 (Earth-616)|MI13]], and once met [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]].<!-- {{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 6}} -->

After the death of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] liaison [[Robert Ralston (Earth-616)|Senator Robert Ralston]] at the hands of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]],{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 3}} Charles Dalton became S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new interim liaison between the organization and the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council (Earth-616)|Security Council]].{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 6}}

Sometime thereafter, Dalton became a member of the [[World Security Council (Earth-616)|World Security Council]] and was present for the trial of [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]]. Around the same time, Charles had also coordinated a joint operation between [[Joseph Chapman (Earth-616)|Union Jack]] and [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America]] to root out the [[Darkholders (Earth-616)|Cult of the Darkhold]], who had established a presence in [[Scotland]], after a fracking operation by a company tied to Dalton had unearthed a [[Demons|demon]] which called to them. Rogers then led the Darkholders directly to Minister Dalton's office in [[The Shard]] in order to use his inopportune death to sway the outcome of the World Security Council's vote regarding Maria Hill's tribunal.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #9}}

After he was murdered, [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-616)|Agent Phil Coulson]] began to suspect Captain America's involvement.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 27}}
