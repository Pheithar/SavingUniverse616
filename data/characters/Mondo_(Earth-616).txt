| Overview             ='''Mondo''' is a Samoan [[Homo superior|Mutant]] with the power to take on the properties of any organic or inorganic material he comes into contact.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 7}} He was cloned by the [[Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616)|Black Tom Cassidy]] and [[Mondo (Clone) (Earth-616)|the clone]] was sent to infiltrate [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]].{{r|Generation X Annual Vol 1 1995}} He later joined the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] and emigrated to the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. His powers later gave him a unique connection and unity with the living island.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 1}}

| History                 = Mondo was once friends with [[Cordelia Frost (Earth-616)|Cordelia Frost]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost's]] younger sister.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 3}} In an attempt to make a bid for the position of [[White Queen]] of the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]], Cordelia had Mondo contained and handed him over to the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club. Cordelia's scheme backfired; Mondo was kidnapped by a third party representing the mysterious "Barrington", leaving her with nothing. Barrington was actually [[Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616)|Black Tom Cassidy]], who freed Mondo. Seeing an opportunity, Tom created a plant-life "clone" of Mondo to infiltrate [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]]  for him. Cordelia went to Emma, headmistress of the Massachusetts Academy, for help and, soon after, "Mondo" was rescued by Generation X and subsequently accepted an invitation to join the school.{{r|Generation X Annual Vol 1 1995}}

Later, the real Mondo appeared alongside Black Tom and [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]]. Completely loyal to Black Tom, the real Mondo battled the members of Generation X. Generation X attempted to talk to Mondo into not fighting, but Mondo laughed at them, reminding them that he had never met them before. Generation X and their teachers were able to defeat their opponents, but the trio still managed to escape.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 60|61}}

He apparently survived the [[Decimation]] as he was seen alongside the other surviving members of Generation X in Cyclops' Million Mutant March in Washington D.C.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 600}} For the brief period of time during which [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] took over the United States, Mondo appeared as an inhabitant of [[New Tian]].{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 7}}

Like many other mutants, Mondo joined the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] following its foundation. He became a member of the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] and went on a space mission to bring their teammate [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]] back from the [[Shi'ar Empire]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 1}}

| Powers                  = '''Matter Absorption''': Mondo is capable of taking on the properties of any organic or inorganic material he comes into contact. When using his power, Mondo is able to grow in mass with an assumed proportionate growth in strength to superhuman levels. Mondo can absorb matter into his body, gaining the mass, appearance, and other properties of the matter in question. This change will remain until Mondo's body "digests" the organic matter, which is then disintegrated.
*'''''Matter Manipulation'''''
*'''''Strength Enhancement'''''
*'''''Mass Enhancement'''''
*'''''Appearance Change'''''
*'''''Organic Travel''''': Mondo is also able to use his power to travel through organic matter, such as dirt, and can appear instantaneously in the immediate vicinity of where he entered the earth.
