Agent '''Dylan Mason''' was in charge of the clean up of the former [[Inhuman]] city of [[Attilan]] when him and his team excavated one of the missing Inhumans, [[Eldrac (Earth-616)|Eldrac the Door]] from the rumble. Just thinking it was part of the city, Mason was approached by [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Queen Medusa]] and her aide, [[Elejea (Earth-616)|Elejea]] after they heard the news of his recovery, As Mason told Medusa no one was permitted in until they could determine if it imposed any danger.

Elejea snapped at Mason for speaking to the Queen in that manner. Medusa assured Agent Mason that Eldrac wasn't a threat and she proceeded on to talk to him.{{r|Inhuman Vol 1 1}}
