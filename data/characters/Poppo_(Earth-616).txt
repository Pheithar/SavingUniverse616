| History                 = Poppo the Cunning is an Asgardian sorcerer. He served under [[Casiolena (Earth-616)|Casiolena]], and once she threw a fit at a dinner after being mistaken for [[Amora (Earth-616)|Enchantress]], both were banished from Asgard, to Poppo's dismay given he was made guilty by association.{{r|Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat! Vol 1 5}}

Once banned, Poppo was recruited along with Casiolena by [[Ollerus (Earth-616)|Ollerus the Unmerciful]], who sought to replace [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]] as the God of Death. Poppo ‘braved a thousand deaths and worse’ to steal the  [[Crystal of Eternal View]], which he used to view other worlds. Once Poppo watched the return of the [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] to Hela’s forces through the Crystal, he devised a plan that would use the Valkyrie against Hela’s forces, turning the tide of battle to Ollerus’s favor. Said plan involved Poppo using his magic to rise a mountain amid a battle between Hela and Ollerus' armies, causing an earthquake that broke the battle up. Valkyrie investigated the mountain and was drawn through a portal to her original body. She touched it and the souls switched; Valkyrie was unconscious in her true form, while the form she’d been using became possessed by the soul of the maddened [[Barbara Denton (Earth-616)|Barbara Norriss]].{{r|Defenders Vol 1 66}}

To ensure the true Valkyrie would be kept prisoner, Poppo fired mystic bolts at Brunnhilde and put a spell on her door so that she could not escape. The Barbara Norriss Valkyrie duped the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] into joining Ollerus' army, and Poppo could even use her along with the Crystal to slay Earth men and women and transport their souls to [[Valhalla (Afterlife)|Valhalla]], where they added to the Unmerciful's troops.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 67}} However, once the true Valkyrie broke free, the Defenders rallied with Hela's forces against the forces of Ollerus and, when the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] destroyed Ollerus's mountain, proved triumphant. All the defeated were banished to [[Niffleheim]].{{r|Defenders Vol 1 68}} 

Poppo and Casiolena eventually broke out of Niffelheim and escaped to New York, where the sorceress build a base at an abandoned hospital on [[Roosevelt Island]], and started recruiting superpowered people for an army that would help her get control of Midgard. Casiolena's cranky behavior got worse once she discovered [[Patricia Walker  (Earth-616)|Hellcat]], one of the Defenders who foiled her decades prior, was also looking to help the gifted. Eventually Hellcat and Valkryie ended up as Casiolena's prisoners.{{r|Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat! Vol 1 4}} However, Poppo had had enough of working with such an unpleasant person, and while following Casiolena's orders to restrain Valkyrie's winged horse [[Aragorn (Earth-616)|Aragorn]], he grabbed Hellcat's cellphone and started an app which would inform her location to her friend [[Ian Soo (Earth-616)|Ian]]. Once back, Casiolena asked Poppo to remove the tongues of the prisoners, an order which he questioned. This led to a diminished version of the intended torture, where Poppo would only gag them with duct tape. The women easily got the best of Poppo and restrained him with the tape. Following Hellcat comparing  Casiolena to Enchantress, the sorceress threw a fit and attacked the prisoners and Poppo with her magic. Suddenly, [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] and Ian broke into the facility riding on Aragorn, and She-Hulk tackled Casiolena. Poppo was ordered to help his queen, but he replied that "I think I'm gonna sit this one out". Angry, Casiolena tried to kill him with a boulder made out of debris, but she was stopped by Ian's telekinesis. Hellcat then pounced on Casiolena, defeating the Asgardian, as Valkyrie and She-Hulk helped contain her. Poppo then took the opportunity to call Casiolena out, revealing his long resentment for being  mistreated and eventual action to "call the cavalry". The heroes praised Poppo, and while Valkyrie carried him back she stated he would be welcomed back to Asgard. {{r|Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat! Vol 1 5}}

| Powers                  = Poppo had strong magic powers upon introduction. However, these seemed to be tied to Ollerus, as he said to Poppo "the source of the power is within me, thou dids't but channel it".{{r|Defenders Vol 1 67}} Thus Poppo appeared to have no supernatural abilities following his banishment to Niffelheim.
