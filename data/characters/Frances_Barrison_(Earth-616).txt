===Early Life===
During her childhood, Frances Barrison was abused by her mother for being overweight, driving her to drugs and leading to her later fixation on becoming a mother herself.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #391}}

[[File:Frances Barrison (Earth-616) from Spider-Man The Jackal Files Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|left|thumb|left|150px]]
===Shriek===
Barrison became a drug dealer, which exposed her to situations that ultimately damaged her sanity; namely, being shot in the head by a police officer, and exposure to the [[Darkforce Dimension]] via [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]]'s containment.{{r|Web of Spider-Man #101}}

===[[Maximum Carnage]]===
During [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]]'s violent escape from the [[Ravencroft Institute]], he came across Shriek, who was also incarcerated and wished to join him. He freed her, and the pair embarked on a killing spree. They attracted the company of several other homicidal super-villains: [[Demogoblin]], [[Doppelganger]], and [[Malcolm McBride (Earth-616)|Carrion]]; and formed a "family" with Carnage and Shriek as the "parents" and the others as their "sons". Shriek also used her psychic powers to increase the chaos by causing a number of New Yorkers to violently turn on one another, although the heroes were able to calm the people down before they did anything too serious, such as killing their own children. The killers fought a number of heroes, led by Spider-Man, but succumbed to in-fighting. Carnage slew the Doppelganger and left the others to their defeat and capture, although he was subsequently contained by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] after a clash with [[Spider-Man]], [[Venom]] and [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]].<ref>[[Maximum Carnage]] crossover.</ref>{{citation}}<!-- also full links? -->

[[File:Web of Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 10 page -- Frances Barrison (Earth-616).jpg|thumb|right|150]]
Shriek was returned to [[Ravencroft Institute]], and attempted to escape twice. Once, alongside the vigilante [[Brigid O'Reilly (Earth-616)|Mayhem]] and a handful of other inmates, she was defeated by Spider-Man and [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]] before they managed to escape.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Annual #10}} The second time, she and Carrion escaped and tried to become a family. In the end, she absorbed the Carrion virus into herself to release her "son" from his suffering.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #390|393}} She was returned to Ravencroft, where the virus (which she had been treating like an unborn child) was taken from her by the [[Miles Warren (Earth-616)|Jackal]].{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #223}}

===Freak===
After not being seen for a long time, she turned up at the [[Bar with No Name]]. At the Bar, several super-villains were betting on what was in a chrysalis recently formed. This chrysalis happened to be a homeless man nicknamed [[Freak (Vagrant) (Earth-616)|Freak]] after he had visited Doctor [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Curtis Connors]]' laboratory and injected himself with one of Connors' experiments.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #552}}

===Scorn Symbiote===
After Carnage was returned to Earth by Hall Industries, the company purchased Ravencroft with the intention of using Shriek (who had been responding well to the treatment being administered to her by Dr. [[Tanis Nieves (Earth-616)|Tanis Nieves]]) as a power source for the Carnage Symbiote, which had been separated from Cletus Kasady. Shriek was brought to Hall Industries, where exposure to the Carnage Symbiote, coupled with her witnessing guards beating Doppelganger (who had been attempting to rescue her) caused her to snap, and return to homicidal mania. After Cletus reunited with his Symbiote, Shriek and Doppelganger aided him in causing chaos throughout New York City, with Shriek gaining additional powers from another Symbiote that Carnage's had spawned. Growing fearful of Shriek, the Symbiote left her in favor of Nieves, its initial host, to create Scorn, who forced Shriek to use her powers to weaken Carnage, allowing Spider-Man and [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] to defeat him. In the aftermath, Shriek was put in a coma, Scorn having done some unspecified damage to her brain.{{r|Carnage Vol 1 #1|5}}

[[File:Frances Barrison (Earth-616) from Fearless Defenders Vol 1 10.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]
===Doom Maidens===
After she recovered, Shriek was recruited by [[Caroline Le Fay (Earth-616)|Caroline Le Fay]] to join the [[Doom Maidens (Midgard) (Earth-616)|Doom Maidens]] to battle the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]].{{r|Fearless Defenders #6|12}} 

===Carnage vs. Deadpool===
She reunited with Carnage and was forced to save him from [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] in [[Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma (State)|Oklahoma]]. It was during a car chase in which they crashed injuring Shriek. Enraged by this, Carnage attacked, throwing Deadpool a great distance. Carnage took Shriek to recover at the [[Mercury Team (Earth-616)|Mercury Team]] base, where Deadpool's craziness caused him to question his own sanity. They broke into a psychiatric hospital, where they forced the patients and staff to answer questions on Nihilism. After Deadpool obtained a [[symbiote]], he used his new shapeshifting abilities to attack Shriek. After a skirmish with Carnage, Deadpool captured Shriek, used his symbiotes to disguise her as himself, and tricked Carnage into attacking her; this caused Carnage to suffer a mental breakdown, and, as a result, he willingly handed himself over to the authorities.{{r|Deadpool vs. Carnage #1|4}}

===Sinister Sixteen===
She recovered and joined the [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Sixteen]] created by [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]].{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man Vol 1 12}} After their defeat they were abandoned by Boomerang. They plotted their revenge at the Bar with No Name. They were however easily defeated by the Boomerang's new allies: [[James Sanders (Earth-616)|Speed Demon]], [[Janice Lincoln (Earth-616)|Beetle]], and [[James Beverley (Earth-616)|Overdrive]].{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man #15}}

===Porcupine===
[[File:Frances Barrison (Earth-616) from Spider-Woman Vol 6 1 001.jpg|thumb|right]]
Shriek teamed up with [[John Horton (Earth-616)|Griffin]], [[Martin Blank (Earth-616)|Gibbon]], and [[Thursday Rubinstein (Earth-616)|Ruby Thursday]] to attack a police station. The team was however defeated by [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]]'s new apprentice, the reformed criminal [[Roger Gocking (Earth-616)|Porcupine]].{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 6 1}}

===Detroit Enforcer===
Detroit-based supervillain [[Dick Snerd (Earth-616)|Nain Rouge]] hired Shriek and a new [[Erikson Hades (Earth-616)|Firebrand]] to be his enforcers, bringing them into conflict with the [[Great Lakes Avengers (Earth-616)|Great Lakes Avengers]].{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 #1|2}}

===Marvel Legacy===
Shriek later appeared as a secret ally to [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]] at the time he was leading the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]]'s SWAT Team into hunting the human-dinosaur hybrids living beneath New York City. She made herself known where she used her sonic attack on [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]] and then collapsed the ceiling on him much to Kraven's annoyance. Shriek stated to Kraven that he can have the head of Eddie Brock after their mission.{{r|Venom Vol 1 #157}}

===[[Absolute Carnage]]===
Recruited by Carnage into the [[Cult of Knull (Earth-616)|Cult of Knull]], Shriek resumed her Sandra Deel persona and served as the cult's public face during their takeover of [[Doverton]], [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]]. After an altercation with [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]], Shriek assisted Carnage and the Doppelganger in sacrificing the citizens of Doverton to Knull, claiming their codexes.{{r|Web of Venom: Cult of Carnage Vol 1 1}}

After Carnage's takeover of [[Ravencroft Institute]], Shriek offered herself as a sacrifice to revive [[Demogoblin (Earth-616)|Demogoblin]], allowing Carnage to rip out her spine to claim her codex of the Scorn symbiote. Her corpse was subsequently possessed by the Demogoblin, who changed its name to "Demagoblin" to commemorate having a female host.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Lethal Protectors Vol 1 1}}
