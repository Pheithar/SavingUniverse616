===Early Life===
[[File:Jasper Sitwell (Earth-616) from Strange Tales Vol 1 144 0001.jpg|left|thumb]]
Jasper Sitwell became a [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agent after having been the top student of his class at the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy]]. He became [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]'s assistant, at one point even filling in for him as temporary Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.. {{Citation}}

===Stark Industries===
Later, he acted as S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison to [[Stark Industries]]. Sitwell was specifically assigned to provide for [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark's]] safety. During this assignment, he fell in love with [[Giuletta Nefaria (Earth-616)|Whitney Frost]] who turned out to be the leader of the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]]. Stark and Sitwell's relationship became somewhat strained when Stark also became involved in a romantic relationship with Whitney Frost.{{Citation}}

Sitwell was later critically injured while protecting Stark and was out of action for some time.{{r|Iron Man #39}} Despite their conflict of personal interest, Sitwell was again assigned to protect Stark ironically around the same time Stark renewed his romance with Frost.{{r|Iron Man #96}} Sitwell eventually sought revenge on Stark for "stealing" the woman he loved, but ultimately fulfilled his obligations as a noble agent of [[Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-Enforcement Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D]].{{r|Iron Man #104}}

Some time later Sitwell was placed in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D.s base in [[Chesapeake Bay]]. However, Sitwell and the other agent's on the base were attacked and replaced by [[Samuel Smithers (Earth-616)|Plantman's]] plant imposters. They were all placed in a room and knocked out by knock out gas. The Plantman used the imposters to hold [[Ronald Reagan (Earth-616)|President Reagan]] hostage so the government would pay him one billion dollars. The imposters were eventually defeated by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and all of the agents (including Sitwell) were freed. Despite the events of that day, President Reagan decided it was appropriate to give S.H.I.E.L.D a higher budget.{{r|Avengers #231}}

===Deltite Affair===
When the S.H.I.E.L.D. board of directors was infiltrated and co-opted by the advanced Life Model Decoy called the [[Deltite (Earth-616)|Deltite]], he arranged for Nick Fury to be branded a traitor after Fury got too close to Project: Delta. In Fury's absence, Jasper Sitwell was named the new executive director of S.H.I.E.L.D. In reality, Sitwell was taken away and replaced with another Deltite LMD on the day of his inauguration. The [[Jasper Sitwell (LMD) (Earth-616)|Sitwell LMD]] continued the Deltite's plots until his true nature was revealed and the Deltite LMDs were all destroyed aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Satellite. At the time, it was believed that the Deltites killed all their human templates before "encoding" their personalities onto a Life Model Decoy, and so the original Jasper Sitwell was pronounced dead.{{r|Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. #2|6}}

In reality, Sitwell and most of the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were kept alive in stasis chambers for years. Although they were temporarily brainwashed into being loyal to Hydra once they emerged, Sitwell and the other agents quickly regained their true loyalties and rejoined S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 #42|44}}

===Howling Commandos===
Agent Sitwell was one of the many agents who refused to join [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] in the wake of the [[Skrull Invasion]]. He would join with [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum Dum Dugan]] to form a mercenary paramilitary group, named the [[Howling Commandos Private Military Company (Earth-616)|Howling Commandos]], that would battle H.A.M.M.E.R., [[Hydra (Earth-10005)|Hydra]] and [[Leviathan (Earth-616)|Leviathan]], alongside Fury's [[Secret Warriors (Earth-616)|Secret Warriors]]. In one of these many fights he lost his friends [[Eric Koenig (Earth-616)|Eric Koenig]] and [[Gabriel Jones (Earth-616)|Gabe Jones]].{{r|Secret Warriors #11}}{{r|Secret Warriors #13}}{{r|Secret Warriors #17}}{{r| Secret Warriors #18}}{{r|Secret Warriors #19}}{{r|Secret Warriors #28}}

===Winter Soldier===
Agent Sitwell also worked with [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] again in investigating the underground activities of [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky Barnes]], the Winter Soldier.{{r|Winter Soldier #1}}{{r|Winter Soldier #2}}{{r|Winter Soldier #3}}{{r|Winter Soldier #5}}{{r|Winter Soldier #7}}{{r|Winter Soldier #6}}{{r|Winter Soldier #8}}{{r|Winter Soldier #9}} During one of the Winter Soldier's missions, Jasper was shot dead by a brainwashed [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] while protecting [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]].{{r|Winter Soldier #10}}{{r|Winter Soldier #15}}

===S.T.A.K.E.===
[[File:Jasper_Sitwell_(Earth-616)_SHIELD_Vol_3_9_001.png|thumb|110px|Sitwell as an undead]]
Some time after his death, Sitwell mysteriously returned as a [[Zombies|zombie]], and remained under custody at [[Area 13]] by a S.H.I.E.L.D. department called S.T.A.K.E., who failed to uncover the nature of Sitwell's return.{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 9}} He became a member of the [[Howling Commandos (S.H.I.E.L.D.) (Earth-616)|Howling Commandos]] unit led by [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum-Dum Dugan]].{{r|Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 1}} Sitwell managed to recognize his old friend even though he was mostly a mindlesss brute.{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 9}}
