| History                 = 
===Origin===
Stryfe was the clone of [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Nathan Christopher Summers]], the son of [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], and [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor-Summers]], the Goblin Queen.{{r|Cable #8}}

In the [[Earth-4935|late 37th-early 39th century]], the aged [[Homo superior|mutant]], [[Rachel Summers (Mother Askani) (Earth-811)|Mother Askani]], alias Rachel Summers, led the [[Clan Askani (Earth-4935)|Askani Cult]] which opposed the rule of [[Earth]] by the long-lived mutant tyrant [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-4935)|Apocalypse]]. In need of a powerful warrior who would oppose Apocalypse, Mother Askani sent [[Jen Askani (Earth-4935)|Sister Askani]], who sacrificed her physical body to become energy, back to the X-Men's own [[Earth-616|time period]].{{r|Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #2}} At the time of Sister Askani's arrival, the [[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Riders of the Storm]] were attempting to kidnap the infant Nathan Christopher Charles Summers for [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]].{{r|Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #3}} After Nathan was captured and rescued by [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]], it was revealed that Apocalypse had infected the infant with the [[Techno-Organic Virus]] that was rapidly spreading through his body and, if not stopped, would kill him. Sister Askani persuaded Cyclops to let her take the infant to the far future, where advanced medical science could save his life, but they would never be able to see each other again.{{r|Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #4}}

===Creation===
The technicians who examined Nathan called for the Mother Askani and informed her that the only thing keeping the child alive was some sort of protective electromagnetic field and the remnants of a mechanical entity, X-Factor's [[Prosh (Earth-616)|Ship]]. Fearing that Nathan would not survive the virus, Mother Askani had him cloned. The clone's growth was greatly accelerated until he was the same age as Nathan himself. The Askani were also able to reduce the infection of the virus in the clone. Despite their original assessments, the Askani learned that the original child would live after all. Just then, the Canaanites attacked the base and Mother Askani ordered [[Boak (Earth-4935)|Boak]] to remove the children. Boak was only able to remove one of the children when the Canaanites blasted their way into the room and seemingly killed the Mother Askani. Soon after, Apocalypse himself entered the room and claimed the remaining child, whom he believed to be the original Nathaniel Summers that he infected, but was, in fact, the clone. Apocalypse decided to raise the infant clone himself, training him intensely. Apocalypse later revealed that he was actually making the clone powerful so that he could one day claim the boy's body for his own. At this point in Apocalypse's millennia-long existence, he had to transfer his consciousness and life forces from one body to another, to maintain his life. When his current body grew too old and feeble, Apocalypse intended to take over the powerful young body of the clone.{{r|{{cl|Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Vol 1 1}}-[[Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Vol 1 4|4]]}}

===Stryfe===
Apocalypse named the clone '''Stryfe''' and encouraged the boy's arrogance and cruelty as he grew into adolescence. Stryfe was watched over by Apocalypse's aide, [[Ch'Vayre (Earth-4935)|Ch'vayre]], who regarded the boy's malevolence with mixed feelings. While training in Apocalypse's citadel in Crestcoast at eight years old, Stryfe met young Nathan, now calling himself Dayspring, who was allied with the [[Clan Rebellion (Earth-4935)|Clan Rebellion]], who were attempting to destroy a virus of Apocalypse's. Surprised at their resemblance, Stryfe was defeated, by Nathan, and taken, by Ch'Vayre, to recover.{{r|Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #3}}

Years later, during the ritual of transferring Apocalypse's mind into Stryfe, Ch'vayre openly opposed and was restrained, while Stryfe was painfully, telekinetically held in stasis. [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|"Redd Dayspring"]] and Ch'vayre attacked Apocalypse, stopping him from placing his essence into a teenage Stryfe, until Apocalypse beat them and realized that Stryfe was a clone and not the original. Deciding to go-through with it, until he could find another body, Stryfe began to mentally fight against Apocalypse's intrusion. After [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|"Slym"]], Redd, and Nathan Dayspring attacked Apocalypse, the disillusioned Ch'vayre betrayed his master, distracting him, and Slym ordered Nathan to disrupt any telepathic links between Apocalypse and Stryfe. After Apocalypse was destroyed, Ch'Vayre took Stryfe into his care.{{r|Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #4}}

Stryfe went into hiding with Ch'vayre and eventually became the military leader of the new dictatorship that arose in Apocalypse's place, the [[New Canaanites (Earth-4935)|New Canaanites]] and Scions of Apocalypse. The dismissal of Apocalypse drove Stryfe insane with rage. Stryfe insisted it was Nathan, and not him, who was the clone. At some point, Stryfe found the damaged [[Ambient-Energy Dampening Actualization Module Unit Zero (Earth-4935)|A.D.A.M. Unit Zero]]. Stryfe reactivated Zero, but refused to repair its speech functions, leaving Zero mute. Zero simply stated that his prime directive was to resurrect the "High Lord". Zero functioned as Stryfe's most trusted ally, bodyguard, and, due to its ability to teleport, transportation. Zero's programming ensured complete obedience to Stryfe. After Stryfe attempted to build an army out of blood and flesh with his powers, Zero informed him of [[Tanya Trask (Earth-616)|Madame Sanctity]], the last surviving Clan Askani member. However, as Stryfe grew into a young adult, the now-elderly Ch'vayre found he could no longer oppose Stryfe's bloodthirsty desire for power. Later, Ch'Vyre attempting to kill Stryfe, believing that the boy had grown mad, but Stryfe used his powers to create an illusion and torment him. Only after Ch'Vyre attempted to warn the Askani of Stryfe's attack, did Stryfe fry his mind. After finding Madame Sanctity, Stryfe beamed her aboard his ship so she could tutor him and, sensing a similar psi-signature to Nathan's, Sanctity agreed. Stryfe began wearing his trademark armor and very rarely took off his mask. It was at this time that Stryfe gained the name "The Chaos-Bringer".{{r|{{cl|Askani'son Vol 1 1}}-[[Askani'son Vol 1 4|4]]}}

===New Canaanites / Clan Chosen War===
Nathan, meanwhile, became the foremost military leader of the New Canaanites' opposition, the [[Clan Chosen (Earth-4935)|Clan Chosen]]. During the war between these opposing forces, Stryfe and Nathan clashed repeatedly, becoming bitter enemies, even though Nathan was unaware of the true relationship between them. Stryfe also clashed with the Neo-Canaanites, a group that also wished to claim Apocalypse's power. When Stryfe's spy, [[Korless (Earth-4935)|Korless]], infiltrated the Clan and Stryfe psychically attacked Nathan, Stryfe captured [[Tetherblood (Earth-4935)|Tetherblood]], one of Nathan's soldiers, and a [[Prosh (Earth-616)|glowing orb]] from Nathan's camp. Stryfe tortured Tetherblood to try to find out what the glowing flask was that he had obtained. After deciding to attack Nathan's camp, Stryfe was met, at gunpoint, by [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]], who had been brought to his timeline to save a sick Nathan. Ironically, Stryfe was saved, by Cable, the adult Nathan who had also been sent to save his younger self and did not want to change the timeline.{{r|Cable #25}}

After decades of battle, the Clan Chosen signed a long-lasting peace treaty with the New Canaanites - but Nathan, upset by rumors that Apocalypse had survived, convinced the Clan's Askani Council that they need to fight again. 

When Nathan went back in time Stryfe followed, in present day [[Transia]] he made a deal with Commandant Constantin and President Brancoveanu. In exchange for future technology plans he got mutants he could turn into an army against Clan Chosen.{{r|X-Force Vol 5 #5}} During one of his trips to Transian Federal House he found [[Roderick Campbell (Earth-811)|Ahab]]'s [[Hounds (Earth-811)|Hounds]], among them [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]] who he believed to be Mother Askani.{{r|Extermination Vol 1 3}}{{r|Extermination Vol 1 5}}{{r|X-Force Vol 5 #6}} Using Rachel and the other Hounds, his Canaanite raided and captured Clan Chosen, among the captured was [[Aliya Dayspring (Earth-4935)|Aliya Dayspring]], Nathan's wife. While she did not speak of her time as a prisoner, it was hinted that she was tortured and raped by Stryfe.{{r|Cable #1}}{{r|Cable #25}}

Stryfe, with the help of his [[Cronen (Earth-4935)|Cronen]], used Rachel to lure Clan Askani into a trap. With his [[Mutant Liberation Army (Earth-4935)|Mutant Liberation Army]], he beat a younger [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Nathan]]'s team [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] and captured the time-displaced Cable, bringing him back to their timeline. Eventually, X-Force beat his men with the add of those who turned on him, freed both Cable and Aliya while Rachel, after freeing herself, defeated Stryfe. To prevent any changes to the timeline Cable had Rachel erase Stryfe's memories of these events.{{r|{{cl|X-Force Vol 5 6}}-[[X-Force Vol 5 10|10]]}}

During a later attack by Stryfe's forces, a bomb was set and Aliya was fatally wounded. Aliya died in [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Nathan]]'s arms and asked him to take care of her son, [[Tyler Dayspring (Earth-4935)|Tyler Dayspring]], unaware that Tyler had been abducted. Stryfe ordered [[Parraidan Haight (Earth-4935)|Parridan Haight]]'s scientist, [[Frisco (Earth-4935)|Frisco]], to brainwash Tyler to reject Nathan’s beliefs and become Stryfe’s pawn. When the Clan Chosen attacked Stryfe, Tyler captured Clan member [[Dawnsilk (Earth-4935)|Dawnsilk]], forging a neural link between them to gain Clan Chosen secrets. Nathan decided to sever the link, by shooting his son, in order to save Dawnsilk. This knocked Tyler out and further damaged his mind, but left Dawnsilk wounded as well. When Stryfe's armies were defeated by the Neo-Canaanites, Stryfe used the [[Tinex]] and, with Zero, fled, traveling back in time to the late 20th century.{{r|Cable #1}}

===Present Day Terrorist===
In the 20th century, Stryfe and Nathan came into conflict, when Nathan, calling himself Cable, headed the mercenary team, called the [[Six Pack (Earth-616)|Wild Pack]], later Six Pack, on a mission in [[Afghanistan]]. Stryfe was in charge of [[Tyler Dayspring (Earth-4935)|Mr. Tolliver]]'s opium routes and Six Pack was contracted to take out the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] armored carriers that were in this route's way. After a brief battle, Stryfe and Zero teleported away. Around this time, Stryfe murdered Louis Richter, the father of [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Julio Richter]], during an arms deal gone bad, in-front of Julio. Later in Uruguay, Six Pack decided to go after Stryfe. After entering an underground bunker, Six Pack battled their way into a control room, where [[Eisenhower Canty (Earth-616)|Hammer]] began to download secret information from Stryfe onto a CD. While waiting for the disk to finish downloading, Stryfe teleported behind [[Garrison Kane (Earth-616)|Kane]] and grabbed his neck, demanding Hammer to give him the CD. Before Hammer could give Stryfe the CD, Cable shot him from behind. Stryfe grabbed the disk telekinetically and set off a self-destruct on the bunker. Cable teleported away, leaving Six Pack to fend for themselves.{{r|{{cl|Cable - Blood and Metal Vol 1 1}}-[[Cable - Blood and Metal Vol 1 2|2]]}}

===Mutant Liberation Front===
Later, Stryfe gathered several young mutants like himself, who were displeased with the way mutants were treated and formed the terrorist organization, the [[Mutant Liberation Front (Earth-616)|Mutant Liberation Front]]. Stryfe's technology and Zero's teleportation made the MLF one of the most dangerous organizations in existence, but they were opposed by Cable and the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]], whom he later reorganized into [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]].{{r|New Mutants #86|87}} At one point, Stryfe ordered the massacre of the Native [[United States of America|Americans]] of the [[Camp Verde]] Reservation, the original home of X-Force member [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]], in order to cover up secret, illegal genetic experimentation being conducted in its vicinity.{{r|New Mutants #98}}{{r|X-Force #74}} Cable worked to stop Stryfe's plans and his terrorist group, making it the priority of his new group X-Force, and succeeded in destroying the [[Antarctica]] base of Mutant Liberation Front.{{r|X-Force #1}}

Attempting to sow doubt and mistrust, when [[Garrison Kane (Earth-616)|Weapon X]] battled his way into Stryfe's base and defeated the MLF, Stryfe removed his mask and stated that maybe Cable was him or that neither was what they seemed.{{r|{{cl|X-Force Vol 1 8}}-[[X-Force Vol 1 10|10]]}}

Stryfe later sent the MLF to a [[Paris (France)|Parisian]] museum to gather an ancient sword, but Cable stopped them, killing [[Jun Tenta (Earth-616)|Sumo]]. Later, in the [[Yucatan]] jungle, just outside of [[Cancun]], Stryfe led Kane and Cable into a trap and grabbed Kane from behind again. Stryfe took off his mask, revealing his face to Cable, who was unaware of their resemblance. Stryfe demanded Cable's [[Prosh (Earth-616)|"Professor"]], as it belonged to Apocalypse, in exchange for Kane. Cable agreed to trade after Kane was released. After Stryfe released Kane, Cable showed him a CD and then burned it. After a brief battle, Cable grabbed Kane and they teleported away.{{r|{{cl|Cable - Blood and Metal Vol 1 1}}-[[Cable - Blood and Metal Vol 1 2|2]]}}

===X-Cutioner's Song===
Wishing to repay everyone who had ever wronged him, Stryfe posed as Cable himself and publicly made an assassination attempt on [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]], founder of the X-Men. Stryfe's bullet infected Professor Xavier with the Techno-Organic Virus, which was still incurable at the current time. Stryfe also asked [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Sinister]] to kidnap [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Scott Summers]] and [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], in exchange for Summers' Family genetic material. Then, Stryfe traveled to Bani Maza, [[Egypt]] and awoke Apocalypse, who had never met Stryfe at this point, from his rejuvenation chamber and defeated him, stabbing him with a sword that he claimed that Apocalypse used to kill him at one point. Stryfe then seized control of his team of superhuman warriors, the [[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Dark Riders]]. Believing himself to be the real Nathaniel Summers, Stryfe tortured Cyclops and Jean Grey, blaming them for abandoning him as an infant, on Apocalypse's [[Luna (Moon)|moon]] base. After the arrival of members of the X-Men, [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]], and X-Force, Stryfe and Cable had a climactic battle on the moon and fell through a time vortex, created by a machine Cable created from pieces in his arm. Cable survived, while Stryfe's body was supposedly annihilated. However, even though Stryfe’s body had been lost, an electromagnetic flux combined within their genetic similarities resulted in Stryfe's continued existence in Cable’s body.{{r|X-Force #18}}{{r|Cable #6|8}}

===Legacy Virus===
As a means of spreading further destruction, Stryfe had not given Sinister the Summers' genetic matrix, but the [[Legacy Virus]], a disease genetically engineered to be lethal to mutants. This virus was similar to the one that the Clan Rebellion had attempted to destroy in the future and was far beyond even the best of scientists, biophysicists, and geneticists of the current time. The Legacy Virus infected a large number of mutants and killed many of them.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #23}}

===Fathers And Sons===
Cable's body was found in the timestream, by agents of Tyler, and restored, but Stryfe's consciousness was projected into Cable's own mind and slowly took control after Cable returned to Earth. However, only one of them were capable of being in control, at any given time, and only when a specific frequency alignment occurred could one dominate the other. The first signs of Stryfe's influence was that Cable grew a goatee. After Mr. Sinister revealed to Cable that he created Madelyne Pryor-Summers and that Cable was the original Nathaniel Summers, he fired a blast at Cable, stating that he wanted to make him stronger, and Stryfe asserted full control over Cable's mind. After attacking Cable's X-Force members [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] and [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]], Stryfe went to Tyler's underground base, who had captured a member of the Askani, only known as [[Askani (Earth-4935)|Sister Askani]]. Now aware that Tyler was in fact Mr. Tolliver, Stryfe intended to start his revenge with him. Tyler began to tell Stryfe what he had recently learned himself, that Stryfe was the clone, but Stryfe did not believe him. After Stryfe destroyed the form of Askani, Tyler used her memories to show Stryfe the truth of his origins, using his mutant power to give memory physical projection. At that moment, Cyclops, Jean, Professor X, and Zero arrived and battled Stryfe. Through the combined efforts of Jean and Professor X, Askani pleaded with Stryfe to leave and Stryfe, knowing that all hopes of curing the Legacy Virus would die with him, simply gave up and expelled himself from Cable's mind.{{r|Cable #6|8}}

===Blackheart's Realm===
Later, Warpath was injected with drugs by the criminal scientist [[Edwin Martynec (Earth-616)|Edwin Martynec]] that stopped his heart. Warpath's spirit was transported, by Stryfe's spirit, to the [[Mephisto's Realm|netherworld]] ruled by the demon [[Blackheart (Earth-616)|Blackheart]]. Blackheart had promised to let Stryfe return to the world of the living, in Warpath's body, if Stryfe could defeat Warpath's spirit, but instead Warpath's spirit defeated Stryfe and returned to his body. Stryfe remained a prisoner in Blackheart's netherworld.{{r|X-Force #74}}

===Return===
Very shortly after, Stryfe was, somehow, returned to the land of the living and attacked [[Castle Doom (Doomstadt)|Castle Doom]] in [[Latveria]], in a pyramid. After emerging from the pyramid, Stryfe ordered the Dark Riders to kill all of the world's telepaths, starting with the most powerful. Stryfe was attacked by [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]], an [[Earth-295|alternate]] version of Cable without the Techno-Organic Virus, and defeated him. Stryfe began to absorb Nate's psychic powers until Cable arrived, but Stryfe defeated them both. After Cable fled the pyramid with X-Man, [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne]], a psychic ghost and ally of X-Man, began to consider Stryfe's plans of world domination, but it was revealed that she was absorbing Stryfe's psychic energies to empower Nate. Angry, Stryfe began to attack Madelyne and Nate used [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Dr. Doom]]'s power siphoning device to negate Stryfe's pyramid's siphoning and Stryfe was seemingly killed in the resulting explosion.{{r|X-Man #45|46}}{{r|Cable #63}}

===Resurrected===
Sometime later, because he was not killed at a nexus in time, Stryfe returned from death. Stryfe attacked the X-Men at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]], attempting to gain the [[Bete Noir (Earth-616)|Bete Noir]] symbiote that had attached to the X-Man [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]]. After Bishop and [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] fled to [[New Orleans]] and met with the [[Witness (LeBeau) (Earth-1191)|Witness]], Stryfe appeared and asked for the two X-Men's aid, as Stryfe was weak and Cable was attempting to kill him. After Cable captured Stryfe, he took him to a nexus in time, the Witness' mausoleum, and telepathically made him experience all the deaths he caused. Cable considered killing Stryfe as "an aberrant form of suicide", as Stryfe was his clone. Cable stated that he has seen the future and will act to prevent it, but Stryfe responded that since [[Robert Kelly (Earth-616)|Senator Robert Kelly]]'s death, all futures have been disrupted and nothing is certain. At that time, Gambit, Bishop, and the Witness arrived and Stryfe explained that the Bete Noir was an ancient evil, that the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] banished to the center of the Earth, and he intended to use it to destroy the Earth, as it was his nature. At that moment, the Bete Noir erupted from Bishop's chest, and Stryfe worked with Cable to contain it in a telekinetic force field. Bishop decided to sacrifice himself, but Stryfe apologized to Cable for those he killed and for everything else and absorbed the Bete Noir into himself, shattering his body from the power overload.{{r|Gambit and Bishop #1|6}}

===Messiah War===
In the near future, Stryfe was seen again and approached in the bar, Betty Noir's, in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada (State)|Nevada]], by the rogue X-Man, Bishop. Bishop propositioned a chance to kill Apocalypse, if Stryfe aided him in killing Cable, who Stryfe said he no longer cared about. After Bishop initiated a global catastrophe that wiped out most of the people on Earth, Stryfe was able to step in and fill the leadership void. Together, Stryfe and Bishop traveled to [[Earth-80521|2963 A.D.]], where their combined efforts attacked [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-80521)|Apocalypse]] while he slept in his rejuvenation chamber, and defeated him, assuming they killed him. Stryfe stole his [[Celestials|Celestial]] Ship and technology and used it to raise an army that gave him total control over the people, save for a small rebellion. Stryfe tyrannically ruled over his subjects, the Stryfetroopers, with Bishop as his right-hand-man for nearly a decade. Stryfe placed Ship in [[Westchester County]], [[New York (State)|New York]] and renamed the city, New Celestial City. Shortly after building his empire, Stryfe employed [[Wade Wilson (Earth-80521)|Deadpool]] as security and imprisoned [[Kiden Nixon (Earth-80521)|Kiden Nixon]], who was used to create a chronal net, preventing anyone from jumping out of the timeline.

After his scouts found Cable in 2997 A.D., Bishop let his thoughts slip from his true intentions and Stryfe personally went to kill Cable. Stryfe found himself battling an older Cable and his allies, a new deadlier [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]], and fled with [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]] and Warpath. In his citadel, Stryfe tortured Warpath to learn of why X-Force and Cable were so far into the future. After Warpath refused to divulge any information, Stryfe turned his attention to Hope, who recognized his mouth and chin were similar to Cable's. At that moment, Bishop enacted his true intentions, to kill the girl, by releasing a nanite bomb and attacking Stryfe. Assuming that Bishop was attempting to kill him, Stryfe quickly recovered and attacked Bishop, saving Hope. After probing Bishop's mind, Stryfe went to Hope and allowed her to remove his mask, leading her to believe he was truly Cable, and assured her that the X-Men were lying to her. Stryfe told Hope that he was her father and they will be together forever. Bishop and Warpath tried to stop him, but Stryfe defeated them both. At that moment, Cable arrived with [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]] and Wolverine mind-cloaked, and attacked Stryfe, nearly killing him.

After defeating the pair and reading Elixir's mind, Stryfe learned the truth about Hope and decided to claim the girl's body for his own, much like Apocalypse once did him. Cable, X-Force, and Bishop continued to attack Stryfe, but was overpowering them, until the arrival of [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]] and Apocalypse. Apocalypse survived Stryfe and Bishop's attack and Archangel found him. Apocalypse begged Archangel to kill him, but he refused and his techno-organic wings rejuvenated Apocalypse. After he was defeated, Stryfe was dragged away by Apocalypse, as Apocalypse stated he was about to fulfill his destiny: to become the next vessel for Apocalypse's soul.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 #14|16}}{{r|Cable Vol 2 #13|15}}

===[[Vendetta (Storyline)|Vendetta]]===
Stryfe was held captive by Apocalypse and was experimented on and tortured for years. He eventually managed to defeat Apocalypse and escaped, travelling backwards in time to seek vengeance on those that had brought about his capture. He eventually came upon Bishop, who had also returned to the present, and Hope Summers, who was trying to kill Bishop as vengeance for hunting her all her life. Stryfe decided to kidnap them both and brought them to an abandoned base formerly used by Stryfe's Mutant Liberation Front. Stryfe then attempted to manipulate Hope into killing Bishop, even though Bishop was restrained with chains and had become remorseful over his attempts to kill Hope to the point where he refused to even fight back. Stryfe's plan started to crumble when Cable, Cable's X-Force, and the Strike Team X-Force appeared and attacked Stryfe. Hope realized that Stryfe was trying to undo the lessons Cable had taught her over the years and chose not to kill Bishop, but did severely injure him. Stryfe was eventually defeated by Cable and both X-Force teams, but escaped and distracted his enemies by telepathically forcing Hope to mimic his immense psionic power, hoping that her friends would be killed when Hope inevitably lost contorl of the power. Bishop was able to help Hope to disperse the massive energy and both agreed to an uneasy truce.{{r|Cable and X-Force Vol 1 18|19}}{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 16|17}}

===Chronos Corps===
Stryfe was recruited by [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]] along with a group of other time-displaced individuals into his [[Chronos Corps (Multiverse)|Chrono Corps]] to stop the [[Apocalypse Twins]] from wiping out Kang's [[Earth-6311|native universe]], along with the respective realities of the Chronos Corps after the Twins tricked the [[Celestials (Race)|Celestials]] into destroying Earth.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 14}} Stryfe and the Chronos Corps traveled to the Twins' Planet X in [[Earth-13133]] to aid the remnants of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-13133)|Avengers Unity Division]] in rescuing [[James Howlett (Earth-13133)|Wolverine]] and [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-13133)|Sunfire]], so their minds could be sent back in time and warn their past counterparts of the Twins' machinations.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 19}} The plan was successful, but Stryfe was killed in battle when [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-13133)|Magneto]] mangled him with magnetism.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 20}}

===Deadpool===
After unwittingly infecting his family with a deadly virus as part of a revenge scheme orchestrated by [[Madcap (Earth-616)|Madcap]], Cable's ally [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] found himself forced to contact Stryfe, who had either turned up alive or was from a point in time before his death. Stryfe handed over to Wade a cure that had yet to be developed in his time,{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 23}} with the condition he agreed to take four lives for him in the future.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 24}} Stryfe eventually decided to cash in on the favor, and ordered Deadpool to kill Cable, using Wade's daughter [[Eleanor Camacho (Earth-616)|Ellie Camacho]] as leverage to force him to comply.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 36}}

| Powers                  = Stryfe is "''the '''[[Mutant Power Level Classification#Omega Level Mutant|Omega Level]]''' clone''" of the [[Homo superior|mutant]] [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] (in his clonal source's own words),{{r|Cable and X-Force #19}} and described himself as an '''[[Mutant Power Level Classification#Omega Level Mutant|Omega Level Mutant]]'''.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 #17}} As a result of that clonal relation, he possess all of Cable's natural mutant abilities, including being an '''[[Mutant Power Level Classification#Omega Level Telekinetics|Omega Level Telekinetic]]'''.{{r|Cable and X-Force #19}}{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 #17}} Stryfe also possessed other abilities through genetic manipulation, similar to those that Cable achieved through cybernetic augmentation. His telepathy was stated to be far beyond [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]]'s, stated to be the third most powerful on [[Earth]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 #17}}

'''Psionics:''' Just like Cable, Stryfe's primary mutant powers included vast [[Telepathy|telepathic]] and [[Telekinesis|telekinetic]] capabilities. While he was alive, Stryfe's psionic powers were vastly superior to those of Cable's due to the fact that the vast majority of Cable's psionic powers were, unconsciously, being devoted to keep the [[Techno-Organic Virus]], that had ravaged the left half of his body, from doing the same to the right side.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}

'''Telepathy:''' Ability read minds and project the thoughts of others.
*'''''Telepathic Illusion:''''' Ability to create realistic telepathic illusions and cause people to experience events which are not actually occurring.
*'''''Telepathic Cloak:''''' Can mask his presence from being detected by others. Can extend these defenses to others around him as well. Stryfe's abilities can, at times, go undetected or be counteracted by other more powerful telepaths, depending on their level of skill in using their own psi abilities.
*'''''Mind Link:''''' Ability to develop a mental link with any person, which remains as a connection to that individual.
*'''''Telepathic Camouflage:''''' Ability to mask himself and other people's presence from those around him. Can telepathically disguise himself, making his appearance to those around his quite different (changing the appearance of clothing, as well as more involved disguising).
*'''''Mind Control:''''' Ability to control the minds and even voluntary and involuntary bodily functions of sentient beings (such as other Humans).
*'''''Mind Trap:''''' Ability to take another person's mind from their body and effectively trapping that mind within his own.
*'''''Mind Possession:''''' Ability to possess the mind of another, and use that beings body as his own. 
*'''''Mind Alteration:''''' Ability to alter the minds of others by force of will. 
*'''''Mental Amnesia:''''' Ability to cause loss of particular memories and amnesia in another person or even in a group of people.
*'''''Psionic Shield:''''' Ability to erect a psychic shield for protection of himself and of others minds. Stryfe has proven very difficult to psychically assail, as he is very well skilled in shielding his own mind from mental-attacks (such as attempts to read, control or harm his own mind), and has been sufficient to protect himself from other psychics.
*'''''Psionic Blasts:''''' Can project psionic force bolts which have no physical effects but which can affect a victim's mind, so as to cause the victim pain or unconsciousness and can even kill an adversary.
*'''''Astral Projection:''''' Ability to astral travel and communicate with others astrally through his own will or through contact with the thoughts and memories of others. In the [[Astral Plane]], he can use his powers to create "ectoplasmic" objects. Stryfe has a mastery of astral projection, and is able to remain on his own plane of existence or to traverse into any of the so-called "Astral Planes".
*'''''Mental Detection:''''' Can sense the presence of another superhuman mutant within a small but as yet undefined radius of himself, by perceiving the distinctive mental radiations emitted by such a being.
*'''''Mind Transferal:''''' Able to transfer both his mind and powers into other host bodies should his own physical body be somehow killed.

'''Telekinesis''': Capable of very fine control over objects, including himself. On larger levels, Stryfe can levitate great weights, into the hundreds of tons, but his upper limit has remained undisclosed.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}

*'''''Intuitive Aptitude:''''' Can disassemble complex devices explosively (separating every last component, such as screws, nuts, circuit boards, etc.) and, just as quickly, easily assemble complex devices. This also has enabled him to even attain awareness and control over objects as small as individual electrons in an atom. For instance, Stryfe could detect if a seal was hermetic, or not, by checking for the presence of penetrating oxygen molecules. Can even detect and discern individual oxygen molecules, and determine the atomic weight of molecules, by the amount of atoms present.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}
*'''''Forcefields:''''' Ability to create protective force shields that could deflect even the most powerful of attacks (even filter bacteria from the air). The upper limits of this ability remain unknown, but it is believed that he could probably protect himself from harm at the ground zero detonation of a 1 kiloton nuclear warhead (4.18 terajoules of energy from the heat, concussion and radiation effects). Stryfe has also displayed such control over the fields as to shape them precisely, even to conform very closely to his body’s form. There does not appear to be any correlation between field strength and the thickness of the telekinetic fields.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}
*'''''Concussive Blasts:''''' Can project his telekinetic energies as powerful blast beams directed from his brain that could apparently affect matter with concussive force.
*'''''Telekinetic Flight:''''' By levitating himself, he can “fly” at for very long distances and at varying speeds.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}

'''Genetic Augmentation:''' Due to [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-4935)|Apocalypse]]'s methods, many of Stryfe's physical attributes were enhanced to superhuman levels.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}

*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Through genetic augmentation at Apocalypse's hands, Stryfe gained superhuman strength that was sufficient to lift about 10 tons. However, Stryfe could temporarily augment his strength to higher, unknown levels with the use of his telekinetic powers.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}

*'''Superhuman Speed:''' Stryfe was able to run and move at speeds that were superior to those of the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}

*'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Stryfe's enhanced musculature produced less fatigue toxins during physical activity than the musculature of a normal human. Could physically exert himself at peak capacity for several hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood began to impair him.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}

*'''Superhuman Durability:''' Stryfe's body was also rendered more resistant to certain types of injury than the body of a normal human. For instance, Stryfe's bodily tissues could withstand great impact forces, such as being struck by a being with superhuman strength, that would either severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury to show for it. However, Stryfe could use his psionic powers to generate a telekinetic force field around his body that further protected him from all forms of energy. The field could repel high caliber bullets and powerful energy blasts without Stryfe being injured.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}

*'''Superhuman Agility:''' Stryfe's agility, balance, and bodily coordination were enhanced to levels that were beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}

*'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Stryfe's reflexes were also similarly enhanced and were superior to those of the finest human athlete.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}

| Abilities               = 
*'''Genius-Level Intellect:''' Stryfe possesses a genius level intellect with access to scientific technologies and techniques far beyond that of contemporary science. He is especially knowledgeable of biology and genetics, all of which helped him to create the [[Legacy Virus]]. 
*'''Master Combatant:''' Stryfe is also a formidable combatant, though his experience and skill in combat situations pale in comparison with Cable's.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}
| Strength                = 
| Weaknesses              = 
| Equipment               = '''Armor:''' Stryfe almost always wore a suit of armor constructed of an unnamed light, but highly durable, alloy from his time that helped render him even more resistant to physical forms of injury.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #11}}{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}}{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #11}}{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia #X-Men}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #26}}{{r|Stryfe's Strike File #1}}

| Weapons                 = 
| Notes                   = 
* Stryfe was actually named after his future self. In a direct timeline, Stryfe returned to the [[Earth-616|modern era]] and almost killed [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]], stabbing him with a sword that he claimed that Apocalypse used to kill him at one point. 3000 years after Apocalypse survived the ordeal, he named the child that he believed to [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Nathaniel Summers]], who he infected with the [[Techno-Organic Virus]] during the modern era, Stryfe.
