===Origin===
Ruth Aldine was born a [[Homo superior|mutant]] with no eyes or open eye sockets. Born in [[North Carolina (State)|North Carolina]], her father left her mother and older brother, [[Luca Aldine (Earth-616)|Luca]], only a week after her birth. Her mother was forced to work long hours to support her family, and Ruth was left with her brother who hated her for being a mutant and causing all his problems. Luca both physically and emotionally abused her, before falling into theft and drug abuse. Luca was eventually sent to rehab where he fell under the tutelage of a religiously bigoted minister. Luca's abuse of Ruth and her mother escalated until one day he came to kill Ruth with a chainsaw. Ruth's mother died protecting her from Luca.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 5}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy #231|233}} Luca was quickly apprehended and sentenced to death. After this tragedy, Ruth was raised by her aunt in Prospect Plains, [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]].{{r|Young X-Men #1}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 5}} The time with her aunt was the happiest six years in her life, and she learned to control and master her power. Due to some sense of family solidarity, Ruth attended the execution of her brother, where he manifested astral projection and stole half of Ruth's power leaving her mind incomplete and broken. Shortly after the incident, Ruth's aunt was contacted by the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] and she enrolled Ruth in the school.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 5}}

===Xavier's Institute===
After the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] went public, Ruth was enrolled,{{r|New X-Men #117}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 5}} and when the [[X-Men Training Squads|training squad system]] began, Ruth was placed with [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]]'s [[Paladins (Earth-616)|Paladins Squad]] with [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]] and [[Edward Tancredi (Earth-616)|Wing]], and codenamed '''[[Blindfold]]'''.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 4}}{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 #7|8}}

Blindfold remained fairly isolated from other students due to her strange mannerisms, odd speech pattern, and her tendency to read other's minds without permission.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 4}} One exception was another isolated mutant, [[Alisa Tager (Earth-616)|Cipher]]. With the power of turning herself completely inaudible and invisible, even to telepaths, Cipher was assigned to reconnaissance within the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|X-Mansion]], but secretly befriended Blindfold.{{r|Young X-Men #10}}

When she foresaw her friend Wing die and the robotic entity [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]] being created because of it, the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] brought Blindfold to [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] and the rest of the X-Men to warn them.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 #7|8}}

When Emma Frost's subconscious was attacking the Institute, Blindfold, Cipher, and Armor were cornered in the girl's lavatory by a mentally pre-adolescent [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and a feral [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]]. Armor was able to physically subdue Beast, but he later escaped into the grounds.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 15}} Armor passed out from exhaustion, and Blindfold took her to the infirmary.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 16}} Blindfold next retrieved Beast's ball of yarn and tracked him down on the grounds to restore his normal brain function.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 18}}

Concurrently, the Institute was under attack from [[Ord (SWORD) (Earth-616)|Ord]], [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]], and [[Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-616)|Cassandra Nova]]. The battle was preempted by the arrival of [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]], who compulsorily took the X-Men to [[Breakworld]]. After their departure, Blindfold predicted [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|one of them]] would not return.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 18}}

===M-Day and Quest For Magik===
In the wake of [[Decimation|M-Day]], only 27 students including Ruth retained their [[X-Gene|mutant powers]].{{r|Decimation: House of M - The Day After #1}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 20}} Although Ruth remained at the school, she was excluded from trying out for the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 23}}

[[File:Xavier Institute student body from New X-Men Vol 2 39 0001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Blindfold and the [[Xavier Institute student body|other students]] in [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]]]]
During an evening of storytelling, Blindfold relayed the history of [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Illyana Rasputin]] to her [[Xavier Institute student body|fellow classmates]]. She explained how the demon lord [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]] reclaimed the realm of [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]] by defeating [[Jimaine Szardos (Earth-616)|Amanda Sefton]], stole the [[Soulsword]], cast her out of Limbo, and began searching for a way to bring back Illyana Rasputin from the dead. After completing her tale, Blindfold and the other students were themselves attacked by [[demons]] and sucked into Limbo by Belasco.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 37}} She continued to assist the students with advice throughout their time in Limbo. She survived the final battle and was returned to the mansion with the rest of the students.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #38|41}}

===Blinded by the Light===
When the the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] and [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]] under [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Sinister's]] orders began attacking psychics, precogs, and those with direct knowledge of the future, Blindfold set her own plan in action. Blindfold sought out [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]] and, grabbing both his dark hand and golden hand, she sent herself into a stasis so deep she appeared dead. Immediately afterwards, the Institute was attacked by [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]] and his Acolytes who upon finding Blindfold, believed her to be dead. With the the help of the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]], Shadowcat operated on and revived Blindfold, who upon awakening pronounced further cryptic predictions about the X-Men's situation.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #201|203}}

During her recovery, Blindfold claimed that "[[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Julian]]," "[[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Megan]]," and "[[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Mr. Wagner]]" would be hurt in some way in the [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|coming conflict]]. Additionally, she mentioned [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|another]] would be injured, but implied this individual would not be in the infirmary.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 204}}

[[File:Young X-Men Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|200px|right|As part of the [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]]]] 
===Young X-Men===
After the destruction of the Xavier Institute,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #493}} and the near-death of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Xavier]],{{r|X-Men Vol 2 207}} Blindfold returned to her aunt's home in Prospect Plains, [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]].{{r|Young X-Men #1}}

Shortly after, Blindfold began having prophetic visions of herself and a group of "[[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]]". Blindfold next contacted [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]] and was subsequently recruited{{r|Young X-Men #1}} by [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]] impersonating [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]].{{r|Young X-Men #4}}

During their first mission to attack the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] and [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]], [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]] nearly died, Blindfold was captured, [[Eric Gitter (Earth-616)|Ink]] was revealed to be a traitor, "Cyclops" was unmasked as Pierce, and [[Nicholas Gleason (Earth-616)|Wolf Cub]] was killed.{{r|Young X-Men #1|5}}

Following their first mission, the Young X-Men were relocated from the [[Danger Cave]] in [[Westchester County|Westchester]] to [[Grace Cathedral]] in [[San Francisco]], and Blindfold was removed from the active roster.{{r|Young X-Men #6}}

===Utopia===
Blindfold was among the mutants to relocate to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] after [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s attacks.{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Exodus #1}}

Blindfold was among a group of young female X-Men pulled into an interdimensional fugue by [[Demons]] in an effort to obtain [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]]'s [[Souldagger]]. [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]] and [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]] were able to pull Blindfold out of the haze and inform Emma Frost, who was able to assemble a small group of X-Men to rescue the rest of the girls.{{r|X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back #1|2}}

[[File:Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616) 0005.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Blindfold possessed by [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]]]]
===[[Necrosha]]===
When [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]] and [[Eliphas (Earth-616)|Eli Bard]] began resurrecting dead mutants with the [[Techno-Organic Virus]], [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny]] was one of the first to rise. She was able to escape captivity on [[Genosha]] and telepathically reached out to [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], but instead mistakenly contacted Blindfold.{{r|X-Necrosha #1}}

Blindfold alerted Cyclops of Destiny's message and distress called on [[Muir Island]]. Cyclops dispatched a small group of X-Men to Muir Island to investigate. There Blindfold became possessed by [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]]. After a harrowing battle, Proteus was excised, and both Rogue and Blindfold were able to share personal conversations with Destiny. It was here that Blindfold learned Destiny was probably her great-grandmother and that her mother died protecting her from her brother.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #231|233}}

Once Selene was defeated, Blindfold accompanied Emma Frost, [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], and a small group of X-Men to locate [[Clarice Ferguson (Earth-616)|Blink]].{{r|X-Men: To Serve and Protect #3}}

[[File:New Mutants Vol 3 22 page 12 Ruth Aldine (Earth-TRN016).jpg|thumb|150px|right|Blindfold imprisoned in [[X-Brig]] deep within [[Fortress X]]]]
===[[Earth-11326|Age of X]]===
Not long after [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Emplate]]'s attack on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]],{{r|X-Men: Legacy Annual #1}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy #228|230}} Blindfold was alerted by sudden visions of a mysterious entity or force that wanted to change everything. With help from [[Madison Jeffries (Earth-616)|Madison Jeffries]], Rogue found an interdimensional squid-spider-monster invisibly attacking several mutants. However, this was not the threat Blindfold had foreseen.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #244}} Shortly after, [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]] transformed Utopia into [[Fortress X]].{{r|Age of X: Alpha #1}}

Along with other [[Telepathy|telepathic]] mutants, Blindfold was imprisoned in the [[X-Brig]] within the bowels of Fortress X. However, Blindfold alone remained unaffected by [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-11326)|Moira X]]'s reality warp and retained her true memories and personality.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 22}}

===Regenesis===
After Rogue, [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], and [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] returned from space with the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]], Rogue became aware of a presence that had attached itself to all of the travellers. To detect the entity, [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Dr. Nemesis]] suggested employing Blindfold's aid. Blindfold was able to see a door in the [[Blade of the Phoenix]], a woman, and fiery death. Later Rogue was able to activate the portal and find [[Ariel (Coconut Grove) (Earth-616)|Ariel]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy #259}}

Blindfold decided to return to [[Westchester County|Westchester]] with [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] during the Schism.{{r|X-Men: Schism #5}} Rockslide used Blindfold's decision as proof that relocating back to [[New York (State)|New York]] was the right decision.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}}

===Jean Grey School===
Blindfold warned the X-Men about the coming of [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy #261}} After the X-Men stopped Exodus from killing [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], Blindfold stated that it was only the beginning.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #263}}

When Angel reclaimed his company he made several students his board directors and Ruth was one of them.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #19}}

After the death of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] during the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|war between the Avengers and the X-Men]], Blindfold was painfully affected by Legion losing control of his power.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 1}} Blindfold accompanied the X-Men while they were searching for Legion in [[Asia]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 #2|3}} When Legion was located in [[China]], Blindfold psychically entered Legion's mind, calming his sub-personalities and temporarily binding his powers. Unfortunately, she was attacked by his mind and left comatose.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 4}} She soon woke up and helped Legion defeat her brother Luca who returned as a little boy from Japan. Afterwards, she and David started dating.

===Death===
After the worldwide chaos caused by [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] and the subsequent disappearance of both him and the majority of the X-Men,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 10}} the aggression against mutants reached new heights. During that period Ruth went into hiding with the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] and had visions of multiple possible futures, in all of them she met a painful and brutal death. Ruth decided to commit suicide to end her life on her own terms. In her last acts before that, she reached out to Cyclops to warn him about the futility of his actions, and directed Logan to save him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 11}}

| Powers                  = 
Blindfold is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] with psychically-based powers. Her telepathic abilities are more accurate and efficient in psychometry. The full extent of her abilities, once stolen by the disembodied consciousness of her brother now restored upon his true demise, her powers include:

* '''Astral Energy Manipulation:''' Ruth has a varying capacity for the manipulation of psionic energy.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 23}}
** '''Astral Energy Solidification:''' Unlike most psychics Blindfold is able to give substance to astral energy to solidify psychic forms.
***'''Astral Projection Materialization:''' Blindfold is able to physically cast her psionic projection into the physical world while remaining impermissible or pull the astral projections of other telepaths into the astral world.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 7}}
*** '''Astral Armor:''' She has been shown to erect protective psi-armor to battle the World Worm.
*** '''Astral Weaponry:''' Materializing a blade of raw psychic power to use in her battle against Legion.
*** '''Psionic Force-Field Generation:''' She is able to create a highly durable barrier of energy that she could shape and conform as needed.{{r|X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back #1|2}}
*** '''Psionic-Force Blasts:''' She can project energy blasts, waves, and bolts of her own psionic and telekinetic energy.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 22}}
*'''Astral Plane Tapping:''' She can tap into the enormous psychic resources of the astral plane in order to manipulate matter and energy. After her brother died for the final time, Ruth showcased an all new power set to match her new found confidence; it may be possible she already possessed this ability in weakened form due to mental disability.
*'''''[[Telepathy]]:''''' Able to read minds and dreams. She can perceive information through reading minds. She can utilize her telepathy in various ways. She is currently learning the art of astral projection; she seems to be at the "adept level".{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 4}}
**'''''[[Astral Projection]]:''''' She can project her astral form from her body onto the [[Astral Plane]] or the physical plane. In the physical plane she can travel in astral form over vast distances. In the astral plane, she can mentally create psionic objects and manipulate the aspects of her environment. She can communicate with others astrally through her own will, or through contact with the thoughts and memories of others.
**'''''Astral Travel:''''' Capable of forging psi-links with herself and her body to travel in astral form. A unique trait of her astral form is the ability to interact with the physical world as though she were tangible.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 7}} 
**'''''[[Glossary:Psychometry|Psychometry]]:''''' Ruth has the ability to perceive information or history of a person or object through touch that makes her knowledgeable and immune to certain objects that may change the course of events.
**'''''[[Precognition]]:''''' She is able to see events destined to occur and experience precognitive visions. These vision seem to often appear as dreams.{{r|Young X-Men #1}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy #231}}
**'''''Retrocognition:''''' She is able to see events of the past.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 37}}
**'''''[[Clairvoyance]]:''''' Able to see far off places or events as well as present events and her surroundings. Possesses the ability to use her sight abilities to its higher potential, the ability to look over somewhere/someone with transportation only by the use of telepathic abilities.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 203}}
**'''''Telepathic Immunity:''''' Emma Frost said that Blindfold's mind is in too much flux for her to read. This does not necessarily mean that Blindfold would be immune to telepathic assaults or other telepathic abilities that only require the telepath to broadcast their power at the target's mind, only that her mind cannot be read telepathically.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 204}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy #259}} However, this ability does not universally shield her from telepathic possession.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #231|233}}
**'''''Psychic Possession:''''' Blindfold can possess others through her telepathic abilities.
**'''''Mental Influence:''''' Blindfold can manipulate others to believe whatever she desires.

* '''''[[Immutability|Reality Warp Immunity]]:''''' Blindfold was immune to [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]]'s reality warp, retaining her true memories and personality during the [[Earth-11326|Age of X]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 22}} Blindfold also exhibited some immunity to [[Saturnine (Earth-616)|Saturnine]]'s interdimensional fugue.{{r|X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back #1|2}}

* '''''[[Telekinesis]]:''''' Blindfold has the ability to psionically manipulate and control the physical aspects of reality. She can levitate, propel, and manipulate objects and matter with her mind.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 5}}

* '''''Chaos Manipulation:''''' Blindfold is able to successfully manipulate events to achieve a certain desired outcome. With her psychometry powers she is able to navigate, control, or warn herself or others about the dangers that may impede the path.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 5}}

* Lack of ability and psychological capacity caused by her stolen powers, left her mentally and emotionally lacking in what she could truly be able to accomplish.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 16}} But with her re-acquisition of said missing power set from her brother [[Luca Aldine (Earth-616)|Luca Aldine]] and after the substantial reality warp by [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]]{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 24}} she has since reassembled her shattered Id, confidently showing it to all.

| Notes                   = * Blindfold had unique and unusual speech patterns and mannerisms. She often overused certain words such as "please", "thank you", "you're welcome", "pardon", "yes", and "no" in her sentences.
** In {{cl|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 5}}, it was revealed that Ruth functioned and spoke normally until [[Luca Aldine (Earth-616)|her brother]] manifested astral projection and stole half of her powers, leaving her mind incomplete and broken.
** This has since been corrected since {{cl|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 22}} & {{cl|X-Men: Legacy Vol 2 24}}, as after Luca's end, the repossession of her stolen powers, and the remake to reality that soon followed Legion's adventure restored her consciousness and her self-confidence. 
* Blindfold was missing her eyes, and all that remained of Luca are his eyes.
| Trivia                  = * While a member of the [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]], Blindfold roomed with [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]] in the [[Danger Cave]].
* During {{cl|X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back Vol 1|Pixie Strikes Back}}, Ruth was a part of the popular crowd; one of her secret desires.{{r|X-Men: Pixie Strikes Back #1|2}}
* A few students, like [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]] and [[Alisa Tager (Earth-616)|Cipher]], seem to be close to Blindfold.{{r|Young X-Men #1}} However, most students, including [[Hope Abbott (Earth-616)|Trance]], seem standoffish due to Blindfold's mysterious nature and her tendency to read others' minds without permission.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #231}}{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 4}}
