| History                 = [[File:Ampere (Earth-616) from King in Black Thunderbolts Vol 1 1 0002.jpg|thumb|left|150px]]Ampere was a costumed villain selected by the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] to be part of his [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] team, but having to face [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]'s [[Symbiotes (Race)|Symbiotes]] he told the Kingpin that he was giving up on being part of it and preferred to stay in prison, as had previously chosen another candidate named [[Incendiary (Earth-616)|Incendiary]]. After Kingpin had Incendiary killed by his henchmen simulating his escape attempt, Ampere immediately changed his mind by agreeing to join the Thunderbolts. Frightened after encountering a [[Symbiote Dragons|Dragon]] of Knull, Ampere announced that he would leave and worry about the Kingpin when he could find him, but [[Lawrence Cranston (Earth-616)|Mr. Fear]] killed him by stabbing him in the back and calling him a coward. Shortly thereafter, Ampere's corpse was possessed by a Symbiote and attacked the surviving Thunderbolts, but was again slain and beheaded by [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]].{{r|King in Black: Thunderbolts Vol 1 1}}
