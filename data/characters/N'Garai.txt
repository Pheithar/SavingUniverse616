===Origin===
The N'Garai are a group of [[demons]] created by the [[Elder Gods of Earth|Elder God]] [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]],{{r|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins #4}}<!-- "Great Devourers", "Chthon's spawn" --> after the [[Demogorge]]'s attack on the degenerated gods.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 145|146}} They lived on [[Earth]] millions of years ago, having enslaved humanity,{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #22}} but eventually left to live in another dimensional plane after being banished by some force.{{r|Marvel Preview Vol 1 7}}
They also had millennia-old rivalry with the [[Undying Ones]] who also ruled over humanity.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Vol 1 41}}<!-- 

===1,000,000 BC===
...{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #8|; N'Garai's entry}} -->

===[[Pre-Cataclysmic Age]]===
The N'Garai returned to Earth between 100,000 BC, and used humans as slaves, until they were driven back from Earth and into their dimension.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #8|; N'Garai's entry}}

===[[Hyborian Age]]===
Around 10,000 BC, [[Kulan Gath (Impostor) (Earth-616)|Kulan Gath]] was transported to the dimension of the N'Garai which he described as making [[Stygia (Hyboria)|Stygia]] look like a paradise.{{r|Conan the Barbarian Vol 1 259}}

===Antiquity===
Some of the [[Mabdhara]] sought to claim the soul of [[Marada Starhair (Earth-616)|Marada Starhair]] for her mystical powers, with the help of their servant [[Simyon Karashnur (Earth-616)|Simyon Karashnur]]. They were successful in capturing her, and [[Y'Garon (Earth-616)|Y'Garon]] began torturing her and replacing pieces of her soul with his own in an attempt to make her his consort. However, [[Gaius Marcellus Fulva (Earth-616)|Tribune Gaius Marcellus]] managed to save her and went to [[Rome (Italy)|Rome]], but the N'Garai eventually killed for it after Marada was brought to [[Ashandriar]]. Then Y'Garon used his link to Marada to make another demon disguise himself as Marada.{{r|Epic Illustrated Vol 1 10}} The disguised demon attacked Marada and her companion [[Donal MacLlanllwyr (Earth-616)|Donal MacLlanllwyr]], and despite [[Arianrhod MacLlanllwyr (Earth-616)|Arianrhod]]'s effort the demon managed to kill Donal and abducted Arianrhod to force Marada to come to them. After Marada had [[Rhiannon (Tuatha de Danaan) (Earth-616)|Rhiannon]] teleport her to Y'Garon's dimension where she slew many of the demons who attacked her. She confronted both Y'Garon and Simyon and eventually managed to defeat them both.{{r|Epic Illustrated Vol 1 11}}

After [[Kan (Earth-616)|Kan]] led the forces of [[Jehan (Earth-616)|Prince Jehan]] against the Wizard Kings, the prince's court magician, [[Vung (Earth-616)|Vung]], who had used the [[Black Mirror]] to lure Kan, captured Kan and Jehan's sister [[Shialmar (Earth-616)|Shialmar]] to sacrifice them to the N'Garai. However, Shialmar offered her soul to them in exchange for power, to which they complied allowing her to slay Vung and send Kan back to [[China]].{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 43}}

The sorcerer [[Elianne Turac (Earth-616)|Lady Turac]] during her training in the dark arts she sacrificed a boy to the N'Garai in exchange for power to beat her enemy, [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Count Dracula]], but the demons found the boy's life insufficient and so also took Turac's innocence, joy, love and vision.{{r|Giant-Size Dracula #3}}

The sorcerer [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]] used his magic to make contact with the N'Garai who then empowered him, granting him immortality, mystical powers, a demonic appearance and the power to cross the barrier between dimensions.{{r|Marvel Zombies: The Book of Angels, Demons & Various Monstrosities Vol 1 1}}

Long ago when the N'Garai entered the Earthly realm, they came into conflict with [[Clan Akkaba (Earth-616)|Clan Akkaba]] and [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] single-handedly killed an entire tribe of them, which was witnessed by a young [[Margaret Slade (Earth-616)|Margaret Slade]].{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #4}}

Y'Garon accessed a [[Sa'arpool]] in an effort to bring the N'Garai to Earth. The [[Triad (Agents of Y'Garon) (Earth-616)|Triad]] emerged from the Sa'arpool and attempted to claim [[Katherine Fraser (Earth-616)|Kate Fraser]], but Dracula fought them off to save Kate, hurling them back to the Sa'arpool which was destroyed afterwards.{{r|Giant-Size Dracula #2}}

===[[Modern Age]]===
The [[Camarilla of the N'Garai (Earth-616)|Camarilla of the N'Garai]] wanting to get revenge on [[Marduk Kurios (Earth-616)|Marduk Kurios]] and decided to slay [[Satana Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Satana Hellstrom]].{{r|Marvel Preview Vol 1 7}}
An N'Garai was summoned by a [[James Cruz (Earth-616)|renegade priest]] to kill [[Exiter (Earth-616)|Exiter]], the familiar of Satana. Although a demon himself, the familiar was utterly terrified by the Elderspawn.{{r|Haunt of Horror Vol 2 4}}

When the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Man]] [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] accidentally destroyed a cairn in Westchester County, the N'Garai, including [[Kierrok (Earth-616)|Kierrok]], reentered our dimension, but were beaten back by [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] who resealed the portal.{{r|X-Men #96}}

When [[Dhasha Khan (Earth-616)|Dhasha Khan]] took control of [[Jade (Earth-616)|Firebird]]'s powers, he began transforming Earth back to how it was during the N'Garai's rule, but before he could summon them, [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]] managed to thwart Khan's plan and revert everything to normal.{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 1 24}}

During [[Glossary:Christmas|Christmas Eve]], a N'Garai managed to arrive through a destroyed cairn near the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|X-Mansion]] and attacked [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Sprite]], chasing her throughout the mansion before she finally incinerated him with the [[X-Men Blackbird|Blackbird]]'s engines.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 143}}

Belasco then began collecting the fragments of [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]]'s soul to create the [[Bloodstones]] which would serve to summon the N'Garai.{{r|Magik (Illyana and Storm Limited Series) Vol 1 1|4}} Belasco tried to summon his masters using the Bloodstone locket and [[Shanna O'Hara (Earth-616)|Shanna]], but [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]] managed to stop the ritual and save Shanna.{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage Vol 1 13}}

The [[Puffball Collective (Earth-616)|Puffball Collective]] released the N'Garai resulting in mass slaughter. Because of this the collective was banished to the [[Crossroads (Dimension)|Crossroads]] and the portal was shut to prevent another attack by the demons. The N'Garai killed the rest of the collective and took over their planet which was now branded as the "Demon World of the N'Garai". After the collective tricked the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] into smashing through the barriers of the dimensions, the demons began attacking him. The Hulk managed to escape, sealing the portal behind him, while the demons slaughtered the collective.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 308}}

[[Peter Wisdom (Earth-616)|Pete Wisdom]], [[Lee Franks (Earth-616)|Scratch]] and other operatives of [[Black Air (Earth-616)|Black Air]], had been observing a N'Garai cairn until during a conflict between the X-Men and [[Weird Happenings Organization (Earth-616)|W.H.O.]], some members of Black Air foolishly slew some members of W.H.O. which allowed the N'Garai to be summoned. The X-Men and Wisdom fought them and used Scratch--who was now controlled by [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]]--to drive them back to the cairn which was then destroyed.{{r|Five Decades of the X-Men}}

When the [[Darkhold Dwarf (Earth-616)|Dwarf]] tricked [[Aurora Poule (Earth-616)|Aurora Poule]] into using the [[Darkhold]] to get her revenge on the [[Perfection (Town)|Perfection]] town, the N'Garai were summoned to aid her. Some of the N'Garai attacked [[Samson Buchanan (Earth-616)|Sam Buchana]] and [[Louise Hastings (Earth-616)|Louise Hastings]], but luckily were killed by [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]], while some others had trapped [[Victoria Montesi (Earth-616)|Vicki Montesi]] inside an elevator.{{r|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins Vol 1 3}} Then, after [[Modred (Earth-616)|Modred]] located the N'Garai's cairn, he told Aurora that her unborn child had now become a N'Garai, since they had no natural way to reproduce. After Modred sacrificed a woman by hurling her through the cairn to test if humans could pass through, he went to N'Garai's dimension to retrieve his soul.{{r|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins Vol 1 4}}

After finding out that she was pregnant with her father, Chthon, Victoria tried to kill herself to prevent from giving birth, but was stopped from Sam. Then a group of N'Garai showed up and tried to catch Victoria in order to protect her to ensure the rebirth of their master. The duo were chased by demons throughout the ruins of the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], until they were saved by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]].{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 145}}

Overtime, the cairn near the X-Mansion reopened again releasing another N'Garai demon. The N'Garai confronted [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], but because of regression in his feral state, slew the demon and followed another one into the cairn. [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] went after Logan and found him battling an entire armada of N'Garai, despite being heavily injured. Because Logan and slipped into a feral rage he intended to kill every single remaining N'Garai until there wasn't any left. Kierrok fearing that he might succeed, send both the X-Men back to their world.{{r|Wolverine Annual Vol 1 1995}}

Wanting to conquer his masters Belasco tricked [[Bloodscream (Earth-616)|Bloodscream]] into assembling an entire armada of zombie ships to attack the N'Garai in [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]'s island within the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. The X-Men, alongside [[Aleytys Forrester (Earth-616)|Lee Forrester]], tried to investigate, but were eventually captured by Belasco. After Belasco trapped Psylocke inside a crystal, he used the crystal to open the cairn and conquer the demons. Belasco confronted Kierrok and at first had the upper hand, but Lee managed to shot the crystal, and Bloodscream sacrificed himself to push Belasco through the cairn before it closed.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 9}}

The [[Ru'Tai]], a slave caste of the N'Garai, were inspired by Wolverine's battle against Kierrok and rebelled against their oppressors, killing Kierrok with their leader [[Pilgrimm (Earth-616)|Pilgrimm]] keeping his eye as an amulet.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 75}}

When Kulan Gath attempted to sacrifice the goddess [[Peliali (Earth-616)|Peliali]] to his masters, his plans were thwarted by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and Peliali's daughter [[Maria de Guadalupe Santiago (Earth-616)|Silverclaw]]. This left Kulan Gath to be consumed by his masters instead.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 29|30}}

Not all of the N'Garai had been slayed, and regrouped, teaming up with Belasco who until now hadn't realize that the N'Garai were his masters. They gave Belasco a new arm and planned to conquer [[Limbo (Otherplace)|Limbo]], intending to use it as a stepping stone towards Earth. Belasco tricked Shadowcat into believing that Earth was conquered by the N'Garai via a illusion. She and the other X-Men performed a black magic blood spell to aid them against the demons, but instead it disguised them as the N'Garai, with Kitty trading their souls to the N'Garai which allowed them to take possession of the other members of the X-Men--[[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], Nightcrawler and [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]]. Then Bleasco revealed his illusion and his plan, and sent the N'Garai to attack Kitty and [[Jimaine Szardos (Earth-616)|Magik]].{{r|Black Sun: X-Men Vol 1 1}} After Magik dispatched the N'Garai that was sent after her, the N'Garai possessing Storm tried to suck [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]]'s soul to which it succeeded, despite the effort of Psylocke and Pilgrimm.{{r|Black Sun: Storm Vol 1 2}} Then a more evolved N'Garai emerged the cairn wanting to eradicate mankind, while the N'Garai-possessed Banshee and Sunfire went to [[Genosha]] to claim the souls of [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] and [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] to which also succeeded.{{r|Black Sun: Banshee and Sunfire Vol 1 3}} The evolved N'Garai assaulted [[Neal Shaara (Earth-616)|Thunderbird]] in Limbo getting the upper hand, until Wolverine intervened to save his friend's life. Unfortunately, thirteen N'Garai cairns have appeared around Earth near sites of mystical power, such as [[Vatican City]] where the N'Garai-possessed Colossus and Nightcrawler were. They clashed with Pilgrimm, [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] and [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], but the demons managed to steal Beast's soul.{{r|Black Sun: Colossus and Nightcrawler Vol 1 1}} After collecting all of the Bloodstones, Belasco began reading the spell, but he and the N'Garai were assaulted by Wolverine, Thunderbird and Phoenix. Pilgrimm also entered the battle against both sides, but was defeated by Phoenix. Then Magik tricked Belasco by using Kitty to resurrect the X-Men and they were able destroy Belasco's castle and all of the Cairns around the world, ending their threat.{{r|Black Sun: Wolverine and Thunderbird Vol 1 1}}

The N'Garai B'Terak and M'Drul established themselves in [[Abergylid]], [[Wales]], kidnapping local residents to have them sacrificed to Kierrok. Despite being invisible to the normal human eyes, the X-Man [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] was able to see them thanks to the darkness that had been put on her soul by Magik, and contacted the disbanded X-Men. After handing a list of the missing town's people to the local constable Rhys, she witnessed the two demons trying to kidnap some children. She held them off long enough for the children to escape and retreated to the local museum where she summoned her [[Souldagger]] and killed the demons. However, another group of N'Garai soon appeared and attacked her, but luckily was saved by the regrouped X-Men who had got the message. After killing the demons, the X-Men went to their base inside a mining cave where they found Kierrok who had been partially brought to Earth thanks to the sacrifices. While the X-Men battled the N'Garai demons, Pixie tricked Kierrok into destroying the supports of the cave, causing the entire cave to collapse on top of Kierrok, severing his link to Earth, but not before Pixie teleported the X-Men to safety.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2008 X-Men}}
