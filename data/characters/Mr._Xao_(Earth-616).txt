Xao was one of the immortal [[Lightning Lords of Nepal (Earth-616)|Lightning Lords]]. His two brothers were killed by [[Orson Randall (Earth-616)|Iron Fist (Orson Randall)]] and as a result, he wanted to get revenge on [[K'un-Lun]]. In the modern day, he offered a 10.6 billion dollar deal to [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Daniel Rand]], who refused.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist Vol 1 #1}} He then welcomed [[Davos (Earth-616)|Davos]] when he arrived at [[Wai-Go Industries]].{{r|Immortal Iron Fist Vol 1 #3}} Xao was later contacted by [[Jeryn Hogarth (Earth-616)|Jeryn Hogarth]], who eventually agreed to his offer.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist Vol 1 #4}} He then forced him to build a gate way to K'un-Lun with the help of [[Davos (Earth-616)|Steel Serpent]] and [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]. His plan was to destroy the city with a train loaded with bombs while Davos acted as a spy inside the city. Meanwhile, he also made a deal with [[Nu-An (Earth-616)|Yu-Ti]] to murder [[Lei-Kung (Earth-616)|Thunderer]]. However, when Iron Fist revealed that Xao intended on destroying K'un-Lun, not conquering it, Davos defected. Together, the [[Immortal Weapons (Earth-616)|Immortal Weapons]] foiled his plans and destroyed the portal and the train. When Iron Fist cornered Xao, he realized he couldn't win and jumped to his death instead.{{r|Immortal Iron Fist Vol 1 14}}
