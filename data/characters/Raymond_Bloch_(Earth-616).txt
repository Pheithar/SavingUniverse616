===The Enforcers===
'''Raymond Bloch''' aka the '''Ox''' was a member of the criminal gang known as the [[Enforcers (Earth-616)|Enforcers]]. Although he was very, strong he was never particularly bright. While under the employ of the [[Frederick Foswell (Earth-616)|Big Man]], Ox was involved in one of many clashes with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #10}} The Enforcers continued to be hired by various crime bosses vying for power in the New York crime scene, including the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #14}} They also teamed up with [[William Baker (Earth-616)|the Sandman]] to kidnap [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|the Human Torch]], but they were defeated when Spider-Man freed the young hero.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #19}}

===The Fellowship of Fear===
The Ox also worked with [[Zoltan Drago (Earth-616)|Mr. Fear]] and the [[Leopold Stryke (Earth-616)|Eel]] as the [[Fellowship of Fear (Earth-616)|Fellowship of Fear]] against [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]].{{r|Daredevil #6}}

===Body Exchange===
While breaking out of prison with his cell mate [[Karl Stragg (Earth-616)|Karl Stragg]]. Stragg, a brilliant scientist, offered to increase the Ox's intelligence. However this was a trick and Stragg instead switched bodies with the Ox, leaving him in a puny body while Stragg rampaged across New York, eventually stopped and killed while fighting Daredevil.{{r|Daredevil #15}}

===Apparent Death===
Raymond, now trapped in Stragg's body, was arrested and imprisoned. Upon his release, residual radiation caused him to mutate into a form much like that of his original body. Fighting Daredevil once again, the Ox eventually exploded due to the build up of radiation in his body.{{r|Daredevil #86}}

Raymond was believed to be dead for some time afterwards, and his brother [[Ronald Bloch (Earth-616)|Ronald]] took his place as the new Ox for some time.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #19}}

===First Return===
However, Raymond survived, and was living in the alleys of New York until he was found and revitalized by the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]].{{r|Spider-Man #94}}

===The Heroic Age===
Ox was seen at the Raft when he is among the prisoners who witnessed [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] being marched to his cell.{{r|Enter the Heroic Age #1}}

===The Regency===
Ox later robbed a grocery store and walked way with the cash register when seemingly no one present was willing to stop him; however, [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Miles Morales]] swung by and attacked him, though was surprised that he didn't go down at first. Miles then used his Venom Blast to bring Ox down and webbed him. Taken to [[Ryker's Island|The Cellar]], a maximum security prison built upon Ryker's Island by [[Empire Unlimited (Earth-616)|Empire Unlimited]], Ox was placed in a glass tube alongside [[Hubert Carpenter (Earth-616)|Walrus]]. When Ox asked [[Shannon Stillwell (Earth-616)|Dr. Stillwell]] if they expected him to live like this, Shannon stated that they don't, and then flooded the containment, placing Ox in suspended animation and allowing [[Augustus Roman (Earth-616)|Regent]] access to Ox's enhanced strength.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 #1}} He was presumably freed alongside all the other Empire Unlimited captives when Regent's plans were thwarted by Spider-Man, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], and [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 #15}} as he later turned up once again in the employ of the Wilson Fisk when the Kingpin returned from [[San Francisco]].{{r|Civil War II: Kingpin #1|2}}

===Hateful Hexad and Death===
The Ox later joined a group of small-time villains who desired to rise to prominence, and became known as the [[Hateful Hexad (Earth-616)|Hateful Hexad]]. During a disastrous performance in a fight against Spider-Man and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] barely three days after coming together, most of the team was killed by a new villainess named [[Itsy Bitsy (Earth-616)|Itsy Bitsy]] as a display of power. The Ox was one of the members who lost their life, when Itsy Bitsy stabbed him with three swords in the back.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool #9}}

===Dead No More===
Raymond was later revived by the new [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Jackal]] along with numerous villains and allies of Spider-Man,{{r|Clone Conspiracy #2}} among whom was also Montana. With their return, the Enforcers were reformed. During their involvement with the Jackal, they overheard the also-resurrected [[Edward Leeds (Earth-616)|Ned Leeds]] tipping off his wife [[Elizabeth Brant (Earth-616)|Betty Brant]] on a story he was working on before his death. The Enforcers warned the man the investigation would lead to, the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] leader [[Ernesto Karnelli (Earth-616)|Ernesto Karnelli]], and worked with him to cover his tracks. They kidnapped [[Wayne Childs (Earth-616)|Dr. Wayne Childs]] as well as [[Mr. Prescott (Earth-616)|Mr. Prescott]], two of Ned's contacts, and eventually Brant herself. The Enforcers protected Karnelli as he escaped from the radius of a powerful explosive he was going to set off remotely, and confronted Spider-Man. After Karnelli's plan was foiled, all Enforcers were subsequently apprehended and imprisoned.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #42}}
