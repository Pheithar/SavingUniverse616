===Early Life===
'''Ripley Ryan''' grew up in what appeared to be an abusive home, often hiding to avoid physical punishment at the hands of her mother. In her education, employment, and social life, she was victimized and seemingly bullied into the fa√ßade she had developed of being a polite, average girl, while hiding severe trauma that would come to a boil later in her life.{{r|Star Vol 1 5}}

===[[Re-Entry]]===
Ripley Ryan became a reporter for the magazine, ''[[Ms. (Magazine) (Earth-616)|Ms.]]'', and was hired by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] to interview [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], who wanted to rejoin the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] after she had come back from a sabbatical and needed to rebuild trust with the public.<!-- {{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 1}} -->

When she met Carol for the first time to interview her, they were attacked by [[Mahkizmo (Earth-74101)|Nuclear Man]], who managed to defeat both Captain Marvel and the Avengers long enough to kidnap Ryan and take her through a portal to nearby [[Roosevelt Island]]. Captain Marvel was the only hero able to follow, though [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]], [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat]], and [[Maya Lopez (Earth-616)|Echo]] were already there.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 1}} Eventually, Carol was able to defeat Nuclear Man by forming an army of the female civilians and heroes he had captured. Ripley was a part of that fight, and the prisoners were able to return home.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 5}}

===[[Falling Star]]===
At some point, Ripley found out about [[Minn-Erva (Earth-616)|Minn-Erva]]'s efforts to genetically engineer [[Homo sapiens|Humans]] into [[Human-Kree Hybrids]]. Ripley volunteered for the experiment to receive superpowers and was the only survivor of Minn-Erva's experiments.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 10}}

Ripley had become a hybrid, but had no superpowers to speak of. Since Minn-Erva had promised superpowers, she decided to utilize those she had stolen from Carol back when she had unleashed a [[Krakens (Kree)|"Kraken"]] on [[New York City]] with a virus engineered from [[Kree]] [[Power Siphon (Kree)|Power Siphons]] in its blood.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 1}} Carol defeated it, but was infected and the powers siphoned off were given to Ripley.<!-- {{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 8}} -->

[[File:Ripley Ryan (Earth-616) from Captain Marvel Vol 10 8 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
Minn-Erva wanted Carol to join the [[Kree Empire]]'s fight against extinction, since Carol was half-Kree herself, so she staged a public relations stunt to turn the public against Carol, hoping when the time came that Carol would join her cause. At the the same time, Ripley appeared as '''Star''', helping battle against an armada of "Kraken" attacking [[Manhattan]]. After the downed "Kraken" crashed into the [[East River]], Star stood by as Danvers pulled one of the pilots, who happened to be a Kree, free from the wreckage.<!-- {{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 8}} -->

Star asked Captain Marvel if Carol wanted her to take the pilot off her hands, but Danvers told her that wouldn't be necessary. When Carol tried to get some answers from the newly fashioned hero, Star told her she had to leave due to some occurrence taking place downtown. This led to Ripley becoming an up-and-coming superhero, quickly rising in popularity as Carol's popularity plummeted.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 8}}

When Star found out Minn-Erva planned on recruiting Carol, she nearly killed Minn-Erva, and left the message "You're not as smart as you think you are." written in Minn-Erva's own blood.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 9}}

Carol brought Minn-Erva to [[Stark Unlimited HQ]] for medical treatment, where she revealed her plan to Carol, causing Carol to confront Star in [[Times Square]]. The two fought, but Carol was quickly growing weaker from the Power Siphons. Running out of options, Carol ripped the device from her own chest, severing the connection to Star, causing both women to fall to [[Earth]].<!-- {{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 10}} -->

Carol was seriously injured, while Star seemed fine. Star revealed that she had infected all of New York City with the virus, declaring if she can't draw power from one large battery in Carol, she would draw from millions of tiny batteries in all the New Yorkers.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 10}}

Carol defeated Star by ripping the device out of Ripley's chest as well, causing her to lose her powers. Star was sent to the [[Raft]]; however, it was revealed Ripley had merged with the [[Reality Stone]] and subsequently escaped from the prison.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 11}}

===[[Birth of a Dragon]]===
Weeks after her escape, Ripley entered the [[Bar with No Name]]. Inside, she got into a fight with [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]], but lost due to her inexperience with the Reality Stone and was thrown out back. Outside, Ripley was knocked out by [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]].<!-- {{r|Star Vol 1 1}} -->

Inside a warehouse, Loki attempted to remove the Reality Stone, but failed. He told Ripley he wasn't envious of her position, because of those who will come for [[Infinity Stones|Stones]], but when Ripley questioned who that was, Loki simply told her it was a long list. Star thanked him for the information and attempted to destroy him with the Stone, though unbeknownst to her, she had only destroyed an illusion of the trickster.<!-- {{r|Star Vol 1 1}} -->

Ripley proceeded to [[Alias Investigations Office|Alias Investigations]] and asked [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]] for help. Jessica refused, stating she knew who Ripley was and what she tried to do to Captain Marvel. The two women fought, but their fight was interrupted by the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], who told Ripley she needed to stop, because she was destroying [[Earth-616|reality]].{{r|Star Vol 1 1}}

| Personality             = [[File:Ripley Ryan (Earth-616) from Star Vol 1 5 002.jpg|thumb|right|Star's development over years or torment]]
Ripley herself seemed a polite, average, young woman;{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 1}} however, she was abused as a child by a female guardian for disobedience. She stated that all she cares about is her freedom, as a result of a long history of abuse in her personal history in her home life, school, and employment.{{r|Star Vol 1 5}} This most likely contributed to her PTSD and her trauma that was further exacerbated by her experiences on Roosevelt Island.{{r|Star Vol 1 2|3}}

As Star, she first appeared to be a hero, fighting crime and saving lives;{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 8}} however, this was a ruse and her true personality was revealed to be that of an apathetic, power-hungry psychopath who cared little for others and viewed them as tools to further her own agenda. Ripley believed saving people only made them weaker, and got in the way of them helping themselves.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 11}}

It was later revealed that during the course of Captain Marvel's destructive battle with Nuclear Man's army, Ripley had gone through severe emotional trauma due to being dragged in to Captain Marvel's "violent life" due to her being "famous". Having completely shifted the blame on to Carol due to her being dragged into her "mess" and being subjected to being repeatedly caught into the destructive crossfire of the battles she and her "Super Powered Invulnerable" friends fought and her being kidnapped by misogynists and robots on the daily, leading to Ripley feeling incredibly vulnerable both physically and psychologically and leading her to suffer panic attacks akin to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder due to her horrible experiences in Nuclear World.{{r|Star Vol 1 2|3}}

It was also revealed the PTSD was further influenced by her death. When Ripley awoke on the Raft, she was disorientated inside a body bag. The coroner informed her that she had passed away en route to the operating table after Captain Marvel had dropped her off with the hole in her chest; however, Carol was not aware Ripley had died as a result of the removal of the Power Siphon.{{r|Star Vol 1 4}}

As part of the Thunderbolts team, Star displays a more caring personality (and has notably reverted to her original costume), showing concern for her teammates, willing to go back and fight an entire horde of symbiotes to save Batroc, and even suggested helping the Defenders fight off a horde that attacked them while her teammates refused. It appears from this she may be more stable than previously shown, or rather, her malice to heroes is directed solely at Carol Danvers and not her allies.

After merging with the [[Reality Stone]], Ripley now has the ability to alter reality to however she sees fit.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 11}} Like the Wuxian Seed before her, Ripley can power-up into a red, lifelike aether with black tendrils around her lower body, smoke emerging from her head, and the star around the neck of her costume extending to her lower body.{{r|Star Vol 1 5}}

{{Navigation

| body   = Minn-Erva implanted a [[Power Siphon (Kree)|Power Siphon]] in Ripley that connected her to the receiving end of a power-siphoning virus engineered by Minn-Erva herself. When a super-powered individual was infected with the virus, Ripley slowly sucked the powers from that individual through the virus.<!-- {{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 10}} -->

If the virus host was not powered, she could still absorb energy from them and add it to her own. She was able to absorb power from all of New York City's residents at once by infecting them with the virus, and since her power was cumulative, she gained great strength and durability as a result.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 10}}

* Ripley is a fan of Katrina and the Waves. After stealing numerous dogs, she proceeds to take them on a walk with multiple speakers blasting their hit song 'Walking on Sunshine'.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 4 2}}
