===Early Life===
The [[Hell Lords (Earth-616)|Hell-Lords]] had long desired to sire a child with a [[Homo sapiens|human]] woman for use as a gateway to gain further power. [[Marduk Kurios (Earth-616)|A demon]] calling himself [[Satan]] took human form and established the trappings of a mortal life for himself near [[Fire Lake]], [[Massachusetts (State)|Massachusetts]]. Keeping his true identity a secret, he married a young woman, [[Victoria Wingate Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Victoria Wingate]]. Daimon was born to the "Hellstrom's" a year later with a strange pentagram-shaped birthmark on his chest. His sister, [[Satana Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Satana]], was born when Daimon was three.{{Citation}}

When Hellstrom was a young adolescent, Victoria interrupted a ritual sacrifice "Satan" had staged in their basement involving the participation of Satana. Traumatized to the point of hysteria, Victoria was institutionalized.{{r|Marvel Spotlight #13}} She eventually regained enough of her sanity to write a full diary describing her life with the demon before she died. Hellstrom and his sister meanwhile were placed in separate orphanages, and "Satan" disappeared to his netherworld domain, where he eventually brought Satana.{{Citation}}

===Learning the Truth===
Hellstrom ultimately entered a monastery, hoping to become a priest. Shortly before being ordained, however, Hellstrom received legal notification of his inheritance of his father's house, where he found his mother's diary and learned the truth about his birth. At that point, "Satan," aware of his son's new knowledge, directed him telepathically through the house's secret basement interdimensional passageway to the demon's netherworld domain, or "[[Hell]]." Hellstrom's father beseeched his son to disregard his mother's diary's warnings and serve him in Hell. However, when "Satan" transported Hellstrom back to Earth, Hellstrom decided to dedicate himself to fighting his father's evil. He immediately returned to Hell in an attempt to battle "Satan". Although he failed to defeat "Satan" outright, Hellstrom managed to pit many of "Satan's" slaves against their master as well as to steal the satanic trident of "Satan" and a demon-drawn chariot before returning to Earth.{{r|Marvel Spotlight #13}} Hellstrom also discovered the powers of the Darksoul that he had inherited from his father. He declared himself the Son of Satan, and for the next several years battled many manifestations of demonic evil on Earth as well as other realms.

[[File:Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Horror 2005 Vol 1 1 0002.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Son of Satan]]
===As a Hero===
During this period, the Son of Satan maintained his civilian identity of occult expert Daimon Hellstrom and was a visiting specialist professor at a St. Louis college. Hellstrom battled many adversaries of his father, and he even battled his sister, [[Satana Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Satana]], who had become a succubus. On several occasions, Hellstrom aided other heroes in occult battle, including the [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]].{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 2 17|18}} He became affiliated with the hero team [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] in their battles with demonic possessions and threats,{{r|Defenders #32}} eventually becoming a member. During his Defenders membership, Daimon Hellstrom met and fell in love with his teammate [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]].{{r|Defenders #92}}

It was during this period, too, that he finally confronted his father and defeated him. Shortly afterward, the Son of Satan declared himself triumphant over his father and his father's influence.{{r|Defenders #105}} Then, the [[Joshua Ayers (Earth-616)|Miracle Man]], a superhumanly powered criminal who had masqueraded as a monk, stole the Darksoul from Hellstrom in battle. The Miracle Man himself was subsequently defeated and the Darksoul was sent into a snake. Daimon Hellstrom was finally liberated from his partial possession by demonic evil, and, with much of his powers gone, he retired his costumed identity of the Son of Satan.

Daimon Hellstrom thereupon married Hellcat and the couple left the Defenders, moving to [[San Francisco]].{{r|Defenders #125}} He and his wife soon earned a reputation as supernatural investigators based there. Hellstrom continued to publish regularly in scholarly occult journals and became considered a leading demonologist. Daimon Hellstrom created a costumed identity of Hellstorm when battling supernatural menaces in public in order to preserve Daimon Hellstrom's professional reputation. In this capacity, they helped several superheroes in mystical problems, notably the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|Avengers West Coast]] branch.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 14|15}}

Over time, however, Hellstrom grew increasingly weak, due to the separation from his Darksoul, until he lay near death. In desperation, Hellcat used an ancient, dark spell book in order to summon Hellstrom's father. She asked him to restore Hellstrom's Darksoul, provoking the demon by saying "Satan" needed Hellstrom as someone to test himself against. "Satan" agreed, restoring Hellstrom's Darksoul although Hellcat was driven insane at the sight of it. Hellstrom said he was grateful for his wife's actions, but if the situations were reversed, he would have left her to die. Hellcat, due to her insanity, eventually died by calling upon the entity [[Deathurge (Earth-616)|Deathurge]].{{r|Hellstorm: Prince of Lies #14}}

Hellstrom once more began battling his father and demonic agents. Hellstrom gathered around him several agents of his own, including the villainous [[Nekra Sinclair (Earth-616)|Nekra]], [[Gabriel (Devil-Hunter) (Earth-616)|Gabriel the Devil-Hunter]], and the [[Isaac Christians (Earth-616)|Gargoyle]]. During this time, Hellstrom's friend [[Jaine Cutter (Earth-616)|Jaine Cutter]] had remained by his side, hoping that her presence would "bring out the best" in him, and the two formed a type of romantic relationship. He also made a deal with the witch [[LaVoisin (Earth-616)|LaVoisin]], impregnating her to learn about his father, including his true name.

===In Charge===
Using this information, Daimon was able to slay his father. Hellstrom was given the 'Black Halo' and lordship of Hell. He claimed doing so would maintain the balance between Heaven and Hell, so neither could take control of the workings of the Universe and humanity could control their own destiny. He learned that LaVoisin gave birth to a son, whom he realized was the resurrected Marduk Kurios.

===Turning Over a New Leaf?===
[[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]] wished to create a demonic version of the world-conquering [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]]. She began associating with [[Blackheart (Earth-616)|Blackheart]]. Blackheart and the Queen clashed with the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], [[Margali Szardos (Earth-616)|Margali Szardos]], Hellstorm, and a mysterious new figure called the [[Mechamage (Earth-616)|Mechamage]]. The Hellfire Club was defeated in that encounter, and Blackheart was mystically bound into the Club's basement. Hellstrom then joined the Hellfire Club as its new White King as the means to balance the forces of good and evil in the Club's Inner Circle. Hellstrom, Szardos, [[Alyssa Moy (Earth-616)|Alyssa Moy]] and the Mechamage agreed to remain together to defend the Earth against other demonic threats, calling themselves the [[Shadow Hunters (Earth-616)|Shadow Hunters]].{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #1999}} However, Hellstorm later claimed that the formation of the Shadow Hunters was a ruse to placate the Fantastic Four as they parted company.{{r|Thunderbolts Annual #2000}}

===Hellcat's Return===
Hellcat's soul had ended up in the realm of the demon [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]], fighting an eternal battle in the so-called [[Arena of Tainted Souls]], alongside fallen hero [[H'rpra (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]]. The two discovered sketchy details about a plot that Hellstrom was developing. Mockingbird was able to send a warning to her husband, the hero [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], during a brief resurrection, and Hawkeye and his team the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] confronted Hellstrom and then used their sorcerous connections to go to Hell in order to rescue Mockingbird. They were tricked, however, by Hellstrom, and the Thunderbolts rescued Hellcat instead, restoring her body to Earth as Hellstrom had planned.{{r|Thunderbolts Annual #2000}}

===Dormammu's Plan===
The extra dimensional sorcerer [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]] later tried a direct invasion to invade and take over the regions of Hell, beginning with the realm of Mephisto. Mephisto joined with fellow rulers of Hell, [[Satannish (Earth-616)|Satannish the Supreme]] and ostensibly Hellstrom, to oppose Dormammu, but was ultimately betrayed by Satannish, who revealed his true origins as a "stalking horse" for Dormammu.

Dormammu and Satannish nearly succeeded in annexing Mephisto's realm, but the hero Hellcat, who had stumbled onto the plot, managed to bring together Hellstrom and the death-gods [[Hades (Earth-616)|Pluto]] and [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]] and ultimately defeat Dormammu. As it is now known, the several incarnations of Hell are shaped by the subconscious thoughts (and fears) of those who would dwell within them. This loophole allowed Hela, Pluto, Hellstorm, and Mephisto to temporarily change the nature of Satannish and Mephisto's dimensions, ruled at the time by Satannish and Dormammu respectively, to frozen wastelands. This neutralized the power of Dormammu's Faltinian Flames rendering him too weak to fight. He fled to the [[Dark Dimension]] with [[Nicholas Scratch (Earth-616)|Nicholas Scratch]] in tow.

Satannish, alone and demoralized at the rout of his master, was easily destroyed by a blast of mystical energy (in the back) from Mephisto as he reclaimed his world. During these events Dormammu had revealed, his supposed ace in the hole -- that Satannish was, in fact, a demon of his own creation and was the demon who had fathered Hellstorm.{{r|Hellcat #1|3}} This was later exposed as a falsehood which Daimon had played along with in order to drive his former wife away for her own protection.

Hellstorm used this claim to assume control over Satannish's realm, and inherit Dormammu's right to rule as designated by the powerful "Flames of Faltine." However, without either Satannish or Dormammu backing Daimon, Mephisto was able to gain control of the vast majority of "Hell."

When the demon [[Olivier (Earth-616)|Olivier]] attacked the other realms, Daimon and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] observed [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Frank Castle]] (who had been temporarily empowered by [[Angels]] as repentance for his family's death) defeat the demon.

===Equinox===
Daimon was drawn to [[New Orleans]] after hurricane Katrina devastated the city as he sensed that demons had also been drawn to the destruction and death. Daimon quickly learned that demons weren't the only ones in New Orleans, the [[Ennead|Egyptian goddess]] [[Isis (Deity) (Earth-616)|Isis]] had also arrived and given birth to her son [[Horus (Deity) (Earth-616)|Horus]] again as part of her eternal search for her dead husband [[Osiris (Earth-616)|Osiris]] whom she believed was returning with the equinox. The demons, and Daimon's father, had not come to New Orleans just because of Katrina but also to ensure Osiris' return under Satan's direction so Satan would have greater control of Hell.{{r|Hellstorm: Son of Satan Vol 1 1|2}}

Not wanting his father, nor Isis, to gain power from Osiris' resurrection Daimon was able to use his prophetic dreams to track down the lost fourteenth piece of Osiris before the others. Satan was aware of this though and ensured that he got to the body parts hiding place as he had planned. After securing the last piece he reattached it to Osiris' body and waited for him to be reborn, at which point he cut Osiris' throat and let him die again to avoid being used by his father and because he knew Isis' search and story couldn't be allowed to end.{{r|Hellstorm: Son of Satan Vol 1 4|5}}

===[[Heaven's on Fire]]===
Daimon investigated a massacre at Project Blackheart, learning they were devoted Satanists who had been attempting to develop the ideal [[Antichrist|Anti-Christ]] to serve Lucifer. The Angel [[Zadkiel (Earth-616)|Zadkiel]], who had taken over Heaven, had his followers on Earth attempt to kill all these children but one of the Blackheart children, [[Anton Satan (Earth-616)|Anton Satan]], was able to escape. Daimon pledged to hunt this boy down and kill him.{{r|Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire Vol 1 1}}

He was able to track the boy down to [[Wall Street]] where he had been working as an investment banker, and found him already under siege by Zadkiel's minions. He was stopped from killing Anton by his former lover, the occult terrorist [[Jaine Cutter (Earth-616)|Jaine Cutter]], who had been protecting Anton so as to keep the occult balance. While the two argued Anton was able to escape them and his pursuers. Daimon was then saved by the [[Ghost Rider]] [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Johnny Blaze]] who he reluctantly teamed up with alongside Jaine, [[Caretaker (Sara) (Earth-616)|Sara the Caretaker]] and Blaze's brother [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Danny Ketch]] who had caught Anton.{{r|Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire Vol 1 2}}

Daimon remained adamant that Anton should be killed instead of delivered to his father but was talked down by Jaine who pointed out that they needed to turn him over, so as to learn a way into Heaven from Satan. Zadkiel had moved a gateway to Hell from one of Satan's safehouses to Jasper County where they had to face off against [[Ebenezer Laughton (Earth-616)|Scarecrow]] and [[Madcap (Earth-616)|Madcap]], members of the [[Ghost Rider Assassination League (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider Assassination League]] hired by Zadkiel to stop them and to kill Blaze and Ketch. During the ensuing fight Jaine was almost tricked into killing Daimon through Madcap's powers but broke free. After switching targets, Daimon and Jaine were able to take down Scarecrow and Madcap. Soon after this fight they discovered Anton [[Martin Preston (Earth-616)|Master Pandemonium]]'s portal to Hell to send an invasion force through to Heaven using a portal contained within Sara, though she was quickly able to close it.{{r|{{cl|Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire Vol 1 4}}-[[Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire Vol 1 5|5]]}} Rather than attempting to join in the fight against Zadkiel and Anton, Daimon and Jaine spent their time kissing.{{r|Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire Vol 1 6}}

===The Search for the Sorcerer Supreme===
After Doctor Strange gave up his position as [[Sorcerer Supreme]], Hellstrom was involved in the search for the next one. [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Brother Voodoo]] became the new Sorcerer Supreme, but eventually died protecting Earth from [[Agamotto (Earth-616)|Agamotto]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 6}}

===The Fearless===
After [[Circle of Four|the demonic invasion]] in [[Las Vegas]] was averted, Daimon - who had discovered the Descent (the day when a Hell-Lord would become more powerful and the ones they marked would become a demon as well as their heirs) was real after seeing [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]], [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]], [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]], and [[Alejandra Jones (Earth-616)|the new Ghost Rider]]'s [[Hell-Mark]]s{{r|Venom Vol 2 14}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 25}} - betrayed the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and joined forces with [[Synthia Schmidt (Earth-616)|Sin]] in her plot to raze the world using the hammers of the [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]].{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless Vol 1 7}}

===The Revenge of Daniel Drumm===
He was killed by [[Victoria Hand (Earth-616)|Victoria Hand]], who was being possessed by the spirit of [[Daniel Drumm (Earth-616)|Brother Voodoo's brother]] in revenge for the death of his brother. However, his spirit didn't die as he appeared along the [[Ancient One (Earth-616)|Ancient One]] when Doctor Strange regained his mantle as Sorcerer Supreme, telling Strange and the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] that he would come back soon.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 31|34}}

[[File:Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 2 41 001.jpg|thumb|right|500px]]
===Mania===
Some time after his frustrated attempt to turn the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]] into one of his [[Monsters of Evil (Earth-616)|Monsters of Evil]],{{r|Venom Vol 2 23|25}} Hellstrom, who was incarcerated at the Peak Maximum Security Prison in [[Virginia (State)|Virginia]], revealed to Agent Venom that he didn't know if he was indeed the original Daimon Hellstrom as many copies of himself were created to explore every possible facet of the coming Descent. Hellstrom also revealed that Venom's hellmark had disappeared, freeing him from any infernal obligations.{{r|Venom Vol 2 41}}

===Avengers Undercover===
Daimon Hellstrom later appeared as part of the [[Shadow Council (Earth-616)|Shadow Council]]'s [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]], where he was part of [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Helmut Zemo]]'s inner circle.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 1}} Daimon Hellstrom was shown to live in [[Hellstrom Manor]] in [[Hell Town]], [[Bagalia]].{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 5}}

| Powers                  = As a ruler of a dimension of Hell, Hellstrom commands vast power in his own dimension, the full details and extent of which may yet to be revealed. Potentially, he can perform virtually any magical feat.

As Hellstorm, Daimon Hellstrom could sense the presence of the supernatural and could cast spells to transport himself and others into mystical dimensions and back to Earth. Other powers he exhibited at this time may not have stemmed from himself (as he had lost his "Darksoul," see below) but from his magical trident. Hellstorm could project "soulfire" (also called "hellfire") from his trident, causing excruciating pain within living beings through direct contact of a person's life force. The soulfire did not physically burn in the sense that true fire does, and Hellstrom could project soulfire as a concussive blast of force.

As the Son of Satan, Hellstrom possessed supernatural powers derived from his "Darksoul," a demonic counterpart to his human soul, which physically manifested itself in the [[Hell-Mark|pentagram-shaped birthmark on his chest]]. The Darksoul granted him superhuman strength and the ability to project soulfire. He was able to magically change into his demonic costume at will be extending the middle three fingers of each hand in the shape of a trident, concentrating, and letting his soulfire engulf his body. Once, Hellstrom used his powers to travel through time to ancient Atlantis.

As Hellstorm and the Son of Satan, Hellstrom wielded a trident made of netheranium, a "psychosensitive" metal found only in "Satan's" extra dimensional realm. The trident was a medium through which magical energies, such as Hellstrom's soulfire, could be amplified and projected. By projecting the soulfire through the trident, Hellstrom could gain enough thrust to levitate and to fly for short periods. 

'''Magical and Mystical Manipulation:''' As the Son of Satan and a ruler of a dimension of Hell, Hellstrom can manipulate, create and possessed supernatural powers and spells. 
* '''Netheranium Trident:''' Hellstrom wielded a trident made of Netheranium which can amplify and project magical energies.
| Abilities               = 
| Strength                = As far as is known, Daimon Hellstrom now possesses the normal human strength of a man of his age, height, and build who engages in [[Strength Scale#Average Human|moderate regular exercise]].

Possessing a Darksoul (the demonic version of an ordinary soul) grants Hellstrom greater strength than he would otherwise possess, enabling him to lift (press) about 750 pounds.
| Weaknesses              = 
| Equipment               = Hellstorm often wielded an asymmetric Netheranium [[Hellstrom's Trident|Trident]]. Daimon also possesses a number of other magical artifacts including the Necromanteion, a magical scrying crystal, and the [[Grimorium Verum]], an ancient arcane text.
| Transportation          = Daimon once possessed [[Daimon Hellstrom's Chariot|a chariot]] pulled by three demonic horses: [[Hecate (Demon-Steed) (Earth-616)|Hecate]], [[Amon (Demon-Steed) (Earth-616)|Amon]], and [[Set (Demon-Steed) (Earth-616)|Set]]. After they were destroyed, he now rides a single demon horse named Iblis.{{r|Savage Avengers Annual Vol 1 1}}

| Weapons                 = '''[[Hellstrom's Trident]]:''' As the Son of Satan, and Hellstorm, Hellstrom has wielded a trident made of netheranium, a "psychosensitive" metal found only in "Satan's" extra dimensional realm. The trident is a medium through which magical energies can be amplified and projected. It is as yet unclear what the source of the magical energies that Hellstorm projects through his trident was during the period he didn't possess his Darksoul.

| Notes                   = * The Son of Satan once used his powers to travel through time to ancient Atlantis. Since he did not travel through time more frequently, it must have been exceedingly difficult to accomplish.
* Although Daimon is the direct son of Marduk, he also appears to have elements of other demons.
* Daimon is no longer considered to be married to Patsy due to the clause of "'til death do us part."
* Hellstrom is not known by the general public to have demonic parentage.
* Upon discovering that [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] could see into alternate realities, Daimon flirted with him, revealing himself to be bisexual, to which a blushing Wiccan responded that he was engaged.{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 6}}
| Trivia                  = * Following the resurgence of monsters in comic books in the early 1970s, [[Stan Lee]] pitched the idea of a book in the same vein as [[Tomb of Dracula Vol 1|''Tomb of Dracula'']], a series titled "''Mark of Satan''" which would've starred Satan himself, presumably acting against heroic figures. [[Roy Thomas]] was worried the public wouldn't accept a book starring Satan as the main character, even if he was a villain, and suggested instead the creation of the Son of Satan.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/son-of-satan-marvel-comics-stan-lee/|title=Comic Legends: Did Stan Lee Try to Have a Comic Book Starring Satan?|work=CBR.com|first=Brian|last=Cronin|date=9 February 2018|accessdate=10 February 2018}}}}
