| History                 = Born in [[Rhinebeck]], [[New York (State)|New York]], Ebenezer Laughton was raised by an alcoholic mother who beat him viciously, and afterward her guilt drove her to give him presents. Believing that rewards followed punishment, Ebenezer began deliberately misbehaving to receive beatings.{{r|Captain America #280}}

Ebenezer Laughton was a naturally flexible, lithe, double-jointed youth who saw a "rubber man" perform at a traveling carnival and became obsessed with emulating him. Training himself almost incessantly, Laughton learned to twist and bend his body into numerous unusual positions and perform various acrobatic stunts. Growing into a socially stunted young man, the abnormally flexible and agile Ebenezer worked as sideshow "rubberman" Umberto the Uncanny. A brief audition of his abilities gained him a job at a live variety show.{{r|Tales of Suspense #51}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #11}}

During one of his performances, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] entered the theater in pursuit of a criminal whom he observed robbing the ticket vendor outside. Seeking publicity, Laughton stopped the thief with a simple acrobatic move. As Iron Man carried the criminal away, Laughton realized the criminal potential of his abilities. Laughton stole a flock of trained birds from a fellow performer to assist him in his new costumed criminal guise as the Scarecrow.

[[File:Ebenezer Laughton (Earth-616) from Tales of Suspense Vol 1 51 cover.jpg|thumb|left]]
One of his victims was multimillionaire Tony Stark (secretly the alter ego of Iron Man). After robbing Stark's penthouse, the Scarecrow discovered some plans for cutting edge armament. He decided to sell them to the Cuban military, but not before squeezing a few more dollars from Stark. Laughton contacted Stark and offered him to buy back the plans. When they met at a harbor, Scarecrow took the briefcase with the money and fled in a boat still with the plans, in order to meet up with the Cuban Navy in the middle of the ocean. As Iron Man, Stark followed the Scarecrow and sunk the ship. Before he could fall at the grasp of Iron Man, the Scarecrow fled to [[Cuba]].{{r|Tales of Suspense #51}}

He was later defeated by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]{{Citation}} and then took part in an unsuccessful mass super-villain attack on the wedding of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed]] and [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Sue Richards]].{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #3}} Next, he joined the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] under [[Luchino Nefaria (Earth-616)|Count Nefaria]], battling the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] alongside [[Leopold Stryke (Earth-616)|Eel]], [[Samuel Smithers (Earth-616)|Plantman]], [[Alexander Gentry (Earth-616)|Porcupine]], and [[Milos Masaryk (Earth-616)|Unicorn]].{{r|X-Men #22|23}}

The [[Brian Muldoon (Earth-616)|Cowled Commander]] later had Scarecrow and [[Crime Wave (Team) (Earth-616)|his partners]] spread chaos to emphasize the need for a stronger police force, but they were defeated by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]], sparking Scarecrow's obsessive hatred of the Captain.{{r|Captain America #158|159}} Placed in solitary confinement for nearly a year after another unsuccessful clash with Captain America, the already unstable Scarecrow snapped. Upon escaping, he went on a killing spree until Captain America captured him.{{r|Captain America #280}} He was later imprisoned in the [[Vault (Prison)|Vault]], where [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and Iron Man recaptured him during a mass breakout.{{r|Avengers Spotlight #26}} Scarecrow eventually escaped from the psychiatric hospital he was put in and committed further serial slayings, seeking to "free the fear" within his victims, but he was defeated by the [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]]. Left for dead,{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 7}} Scarecrow was rescued by the shadowy organization the [[Firm (Earth-616)|Firm]], who instilled in him the ability to feed off fear, after which he again battled the Ghost Rider.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 38}}

Dying in another battle with Ghost Rider, Scarecrow was resurrected by the demon [[Blackheart (Earth-616)|Blackheart]], who sent Ebenezer's disembodied spirit to possess the dead body of [[Barbara Ketch (Earth-616)|Barbara Ketch]], sister of the [[Ghost Rider]]'s human host. Following a harrowing battle, Scarecrow's soul was once again cast into [[Hell]].{{r|Ghost Rider: Crossroads #1}} Somehow returning to physical life, Scarecrow battled the Falcon{{r|Avengers Vol 3 64}} before being sent to the [[Raft|Raft super-prison]], from where he escaped during a massive breakout caused by [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]].{{r|New Avengers #1|4}}

Scarecrow showed up when Peter Parker unmasked himself, as one of a band of costumed villains (including Electro, the [[Mark Raxton (Earth-616)|Molten Man]], and [[Jackson Arvad (Earth-616)|Will O' The Wisp]]), hired by the [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]] to attack Peter Parker in a lopsided revenge effort. Scarecrow was eventually defeated and incarcerated alongside the other villains.{{r|Sensational Spider-Man Vol 2 #29|31}}

He was sent alongside the Molten Man in a rampage to flush heroes out of hiding which was halted by Captain America and the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]]. Cap was forced to prevent Punisher from killing Scarecrow once he'd been apprehended.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 2 2}}

Ebenezer was identified as one of the 142 superhumans who registered as part of the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]]. At the time he also was part of the [[Hood's Gang (Earth-616)|Hood's criminal army]],{{r|New Avengers Annual #2}} but was incarcerated along the other villains after the [[Siege (Event)|Siege]] at [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]].{{r|Siege #4}}

Before the Siege he left the Hood's gang and joined with other Hood's Gang member Blackout in forming a group consisting of other paranormal villains to track and kill both Ghost Riders, Johnny Blaze and Daniel Ketch. He and Madcap ended up fighting Hellstorm and Jaine Cutter. Scarecrow was nearly close to scaring Hellstorm with haunting memories of Hellcat. However, he was stopped and defeated in a contorted position.{{r|Ghost Riders: Heaven's on Fire #2|5}}

During [[Fear Itself]] Scarecrow took advantage of the chaos in town by attacking with his army of crows only to end up fighting [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|Fear Itself: Wolverine #1}}

[[Max Fury (Earth-616)|Max Fury]], the leader of the [[Shadow Council (Earth-616)|Shadow Council]] had assembled a new [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] in the sovereign nation of [[Bagalia]] where Scarecrow was presently a member. Scarecrow was present when Max Fury and the Masters of Evil captured [[John Steele (American Soldier) (Earth-616)|John Steele]] after he attempted to escape Bagalia with the [[Serpent Crown]] and the Crown of Thorns.{{r|Secret Avengers #29}}

Scarecrow went to [[Veridgris]], [[Kansas (State)|Kansas]] and fed off the fear of the townspeople by forcing them to watch their greatest fears on a movie screen in [[Emerald Cinema]]. Some of them couldn't handle their fears and dropped dead. The reports of missing people drew [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]]. Scarecrow invited Banner into Emerald Cinema and subjected him to his greatest fear: he would destroy everything as the Hulk. The shock from the display killed Banner, which allowed him to resurrect and transform into the Hulk, much to Scarecrow's surprise. Scarecrow tried fighting back, but he was no match for the Hulk. Scarecrow then saw a scene on the movie screen of him being pursued by an angry mob. Scarecrow fearfully ran to the projector room to stop the projector with the Hulk in hot pursuit. Hulk told Scarecrow that his greatest fear wasn't the mob but how his life would end.{{r|Immortal Hulk: Time of Monsters #1}}

| Powers                  = As a result of undergoing augmentation procedures as an operative of the Firm, Scarecrow possesses various superhuman attributes:
* '''Mutated Pheromone:''' Scarecrow is able to secrete an odorless pheromone into the air that can affect the adrenal gland of most beings within a distance of 20 feet. The pheromone triggers intense panic attacks and causes his victims to experience intense and irrational fear. Scarecrow is also able to cause the same reaction in a number of higher animals, including crows. The pheromone he secretes affects his adrenal gland as well, though in a different way. The pheromone augments a number of his own physical attributes to superhuman levels.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #28}}
** '''Superhuman Strength:''' Due to the affects of the pheromone on his own body, Scarecrow's natural physical strength is augmented to superhuman levels. At his peak, he possesses sufficient strength to lift between 2 and 10 tons.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #28}}
** '''Superhuman Speed:''' Scarecrow is able to run and move at speeds that are beyond the natural physical capabilities and limits of the finest human specimen, able to achieve a top speed on foot of 35-65 mph.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #28}}
** '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Scarecrow's augmented musculature is much more efficient than that of a normal human. As a result, his muscles produce significantly less fatigue toxins during physical activity. At his peak, he is able to exert himself for up to 24 hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his bloodstream starts to impair his capabilities.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #28}}
** '''Superhuman Agility:''' Scarecrow's agility, balance and bodily coordination are enhanced to levels that are significantly beyond the natural physical capabilities and limits of the finest human specimen.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #28}}
** '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Scarecrow's reflexes are similarly enhanced and are superior to those possessed by the finest human specimen, making his responses virtually instantaneous.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #28}}
** '''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Scarecrow possesses an accelerated healing process enabling him to recover from physical injury much faster and more extensively than a normal human. His healing powers have enabled him to fully heal injuries as severe as gunshot wounds and impalement within a matter of minutes. More severe injuries, such as broken bones, have fully mended within a matter of hours. Scarecrow's healing powers aren't sufficient, however, to regrow severed limbs or regenerate missing organs.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #28}}
** '''Fear Empowerment:''' Scarecrow can feed off the fear of others.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 #38}} The greater someone's fear is, the more it feeds Scarecrow. Scarecrow grows stronger from the fear he feeds off{{r|Immortal Hulk: Time of Monsters Vol 1 1}} and augments his power to heal.{{r|Ghost Rider Annual #2}}
* '''Possession and Resurrection:''' During his time as a disembodied spirit, Scarecrow could resurrect the dead and possess the bodies of others.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 #85}}<br>
