| History                 = Makro is a descendant of one of the Hand's elite female assassins in [[The Nail (Earth-616)|The Nail]]. Makro was allegedly confined to the lab she was created in for years until [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] freed her and offered her a place in the Nail. She appears to enjoy her freedom as one of the Hand's elite assassins.

| Powers                  = 
*'''Cybernetic Enhancement''': Makro is augmented with extra, weaponed limbs and possesses an exoskeleton similar to [[Doctor Octopus' Tentacles|the one]] used by [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Dr. Octopus]]. Her tentacles can respond to her mental command and are strong enough to allow Makro to climb aboard a speeding tractor trailer.
