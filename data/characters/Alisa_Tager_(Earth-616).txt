===Origin===
'''Alisa Tager''' was discovered by [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]], [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], and [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]]. Per Alisa's request, Cyclops and Jean agreed to keep her presence a secret, and gave her the code name '''Cipher'''.{{r|New X-Men #127}}{{r|Young X-Men #10}} She was described by Cyclops as an [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Man]]-in-training and served as surveillance at [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] and briefly at [[Graymalkin Industries]].{{r|Young X-Men #10}}

For unknown reasons, Alisa began to befriend the student [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]] while acting as a spy in the Xavier Institute and helped protect her during [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]]'s rampage through the X-Mansion.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 #17}}{{r|Young X-Men #10}}

===Final Genesis===
When [[Jonas Graymalkin (Earth-616)|Jonas Graymalkin]] emerged from his would-be grave under the remains of the Xavier Institute following the last [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E (Earth-616)|Sentinel]] attack that destroyed the school,<ref>[[Messiah Complex]]</ref> he was greeted by Cipher.{{r|Young X-Men #10}} After their meeting, the two of them observed [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]] impersonating [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and training the [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]] in order to assassinate [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]], the Black King of the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]].{{r|Young X-Men #1|2}}{{r|Young X-Men #10}}

Cipher aided Blindfold and [[Eric Gitter (Earth-616)|Ink]] during their capture of [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Dani Moonstar]].{{r|Young X-Men #2}}{{r|Young X-Men #10}} 

Through the "cypher", Jonas was told to kill Pierce.{{r|Young X-Men #3}} Jonas and Cipher freed [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]] and attacked Pierce. Pierce escaped. To stop him, Magma, Graymalkin, Cipher, and freshly recovered [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]] took the remaining [[X-Jet]] to [[New York City]] to stop the other Young X-Men from battling [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]] and [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] at the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]].{{r|Young X-Men #4}} 

Their X-Jet was destroyed by Cannonball, but after explaining Pierce's deception, the two teams together headed to Pierce's subterranean lair. Cipher rejoined Graymalkin there and explained she survived the crash by "phasing".{{r|Young X-Men #5}}

===Book of Revelations===
Cipher finally revealed herself to [[Eric Gitter (Earth-616)|Ink]]{{r|Young X-Men #8}} to persuade him to help his teammates, the [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]], defeat the [[Y-Men (Earth-616)|Y-Men]] created by the mutant tattoo artist, [[Leon Nunez (Earth-616)|Leon Nunez]]. She then accompanied Ink to Nunez's tattoo parlor and watched him get both his [[Glossary:Healing|Caduceus symbol]] and [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] tattoos.{{r|Young X-Men #9}}

After the defeat of the Y-Men, Cipher was made a full member of the Young X-Men.{{r|Young X-Men #9}} She helped prepare [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]]'s body for burial.{{r|Young X-Men #11}} Later she assisted in battling the [[Neo (Earth-616)|Neo]] on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]].{{r|Young X-Men #12}}

===Utopia===
During the [[San Francisco]] riots over [[Proposition X]], Cipher was teamed with [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] and [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]] in trying to keep the peace. While the trio scouted the perimeter, the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]] arrived on the scene. [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Spider-Man (Mac Gargan)]] attacked them, inciting a fight between Colossus and [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]], who participated in the riots. Colossus instructed the two girls to flee as he took on the dangerous villain.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #227}}{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1}}

===Jean Grey School for Higher Learning===
Cipher was among the younger X-Men to follow [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] when he moved back to [[Westchester County|Westchester]] and opened the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].{{r|X-Men: Schism #5}}{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}}

===Krakoa===
She later appeared on [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] reuniting with friends.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 5}}

| Powers                  = Cipher is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] and has displayed several stealth based powers, including:
* '''''Phasing:''''' Cipher possesses the ability to pass through solid matter by passing her atoms through the spaces between the atoms of the object through which she is moving. In this way, she and the object through which she is passing can temporarily merge without interacting, and each is unharmed. This process is called "phasing". This ability is very similar to that of [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]]. She emits a bio-electric charge through people she phases through.{{r|Young X-Men #8}}
** '''''Flight:''''' While in her phased state, Cipher is able to fly or float.{{r|Young X-Men #8}}
* '''''Invisibility:''''' Cipher can render herself completely invisible. 
* '''''Telepathic Immunity:''''' Cipher is also psychically invisible. It is unclear if she can render herself completely psychically invisible. [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] was able to detect her,{{r|New X-Men #127}} but [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] stated that [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] was not.{{r|Young X-Men #9}} It is possible that Cipher was not using her powers when Jean found her, or it could be that Jean's Phoenix-enhanced powers allowed her to sense what Emma could not.
* '''''Inaudibility:''''' Cipher can render herself completely silent or allow herself to only be heard by certain individuals.{{r|Young X-Men #3}}{{r|Young X-Men #5}}

| Abilities               = Cipher appears to be trained in stealth and spying. This talent is greatly aided by her mutant powers.

| Notes                   = * Asher existence was kept secret by [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]{{r|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}} and other [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] leaders,{{r|Young X-Men #10}} she was presumably not among [[:Category:Post-M-Day Mutants (The 198)|the 198 mutants cataloged]] by the US government.
* {{cl|Young X-Men Vol 1 10}} details both her [[Glossary:Retcon|retcon]] and actual history. 
* Though she first appeared in {{cl|Young X-Men #8}}, Cipher was [[Glossary:Retcon|retconned]] as having been present during events prior to her character's creation, including [[Grant Morrison]]'s 2001 run on [[New X-Men Vol 1 127|New X-Men]] and [[Joss Whedon]]'s 2004 tenure on [[Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 17|Astonishing X-Men]].
