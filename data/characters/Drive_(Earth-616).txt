| Powers                  = '''Superhuman Speed:''' Drive is capable of moving and accelerating at speeds far greater than any normal person.

*'''''Superhuman Stamina:''''' Drive's physiology grants him greater stamina when compared to an ordinary person, allowing him to operate at peak capacity for at least several hours before he begins to grow tired.

*'''''Superhuman Agility:''''' Drive's balance, bodily coordination, and flexibility are greater than that of any normal person.
*'''''Superhuman Reflexes:''''' His reflexes are similarly enhanced, allowing him to react several times faster than any normal person.
*'''''Superhuman Durability:''''' Drive's physiology also provides him with limited protection against impact forces and the high levels of friction that are produced when he moves at superhuman speed.
