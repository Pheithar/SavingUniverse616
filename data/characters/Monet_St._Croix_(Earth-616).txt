===Early Life===
Monet St. Croix was the second child of a rich and eccentric father,{{r|Generation X Vol 1 40}} Ambassador [[Cartier St. Croix (Earth-616)|Cartier St. Croix]], a Mon√©gasque wealthy former president of several corporations,{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 200}}{{r|Women of Marvel: Celebrating Seven Decades Handbook Vol 1 1}} and his wife [[Mrs. St. Croix (Earth-616)|Jamila St. Croix]], a descendant of [[Algeria|Algerian]] royalty.{{r|Women of Marvel: Celebrating Seven Decades Handbook Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 217}}{{r|X-Men Vol 4 25}} She was born in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia]].{{r|Generation X Vol 1 46}} She grew up with an older brother, [[Marius St. Croix (Earth-616)|Marius]], and two younger twin sisters, [[Claudette and Nicole St. Croix (Earth-616)|Claudette and Nicole]]. Monet became her father's favorite child.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 40}}

===Turned into Penance===
When his mutant gifts manifested, Marius was overcome by his hunger for the genetic marrow of mutants and killed his mother. Cartier kicked his son out. Marius traveled in different dimensions, growing in power, and returned to offer Monet a place at his side, so that they might conquer dimensions together. Monet scornfully rejected him, however, and fed up with her high-handed attitude towards him, Marius magically trapped her in the form of a mute creature with razor-sharp, diamond-hard red skin: Penance.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 40}}

Claudette and Nicole walked in on this, and with their sister nowhere to be found, they assumed that Marius had killed her. Claudette opened up a dimensional portal and banished Marius. Before he was pulled away, Marius told Penance that only he could restore her true body, prompting her to jump in with him. As Penance, Monet would become her brother's slave.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 40}} In order to satisfy his hunger for genetic marrow, he would repeatedly feed on her. Despite not showing it, the experience would scar Monet deeply, leaving her suicidal years after being freed.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 13}}

Nicole and Claudette, knowing Monet was their father's favorite, used their mutant powers to merge into one body with the appearance of Monet. Everything about the twins' version of Monet was like normal, including her physical body, personality, and powers.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 40}} Everything would have been perfect if it weren't for Claudette's autism. Since both the twins' personalities were combined, Claudette's autism would sometimes take effect, leaving "Monet" in catatonic states.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 316}}

===Generation X===
Shortly after the formation of the mutant teen team [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]], Penance was dropped onto the front lawn of the Massachusetts Academy by [[Gateway (Earth-616)|Gateway]], who identified her as Penance.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 1}} She was brought inside by headmaster [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], who discovered her powers as he cut his hands by trying to pick her up. As she could not communicate and seemingly didn't understand anything, Banshee placed her in the infirmary as he and [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] attempted to discover her identity. Teen member [[Claudette and Nicole St. Croix (Earth-616)|M]], her relation to Penance unknown to the others, told the adults that Penance was perhaps a prisoner of Emplate, as Marius had begun calling himself. "Monet" claimed to have reached this conclusion through logical deduction, rather than her secret past with Emplate and Penance.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 2}}
[[File:Monet St. Croix (Earth-616) and Hollow (Earth-616) from Generation X Vol 1 4 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|As Penance]]

As the team left her to recover, Penance awoke with one thought on her mind: survival. Tearing apart the infirmary wall and escaping, she was free. Hearing the alarms of a breach, the team rushed to the infirmary and saw the extensive damage she caused during her escape. They split up in groups to search for her before she could cause further damage to the Academy, but [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]], who felt a bond with Penance due to his own mutilated body, left to search for her on his own. Feeling that another deformed soul would seek him out, he waited for her arrival. After Penance fought her way past the rest of the team ([[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]], [[Everett Thomas (Earth-616)|Synch]], [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]], and M), she approached Chamber, who spoke to her in an attempt to convince her that he knew how she felt, eventually succeeding in calming her down into staying with the team.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 3}}

During her stay at the Academy, she would rarely interact with her peers, due to her animalistic nature and fear of being captured again. Fortunately, Jubilee became a friend to her. Trusting the students at the Academy more and more, Penance began to go on missions with the others.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 8}} In a subsequent mission, presumably, to cover up their relation, Emplate referred to her as "Yvette" and the others grew somewhat weary of Penance.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 13|14}}

===Freed from Penance's Body===
Finally, M revealed that she was a combination of [[Claudette and Nicole St. Croix (Earth-616)|Claudette and Nicole]],{{r|Generation X Vol 1 31}} and told the others the truth about Penance, and that they felt horrible about impersonating their sister. To "make things right," the twins, now split apart, merged once more into the form of Monet and swapped places with Penance, freeing the real Monet at last, with the merged twins taking over as Penance's body. Monet, free at last, continued to operate under the twins' codename of M, while the twins retained the identity of Penance. Both remained a part of the Generation X team, while still trying to cure the still mute Penance.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 40}}

[[File:Monet St. Croix (Earth-616) from Generation X Vol 1 63 002.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The real Monet as a student of the Massachusetts Academy]]
While all four St. Croix children possessed some form of power, Monet had a plethora of her own, including self-propelled flight, superhuman strength and reflexes, and telepathy to name a few. In addition to her powers, "Monet" tended to have a sizeable attitude and a large chip on her shoulder, to the say the least. She quickly clashed with many of her Generation X teammates and often earned their irritation with her condescending attitude and occasional arrogance. Her rival, Jubilee, often teased that her only power was simply to be "perfect." While the real Monet did not share these initial interactions with her teammates, she quickly fell into the same pattern of behaviour after being freed from Penance, including the rivalry with Jubilee.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 48}}

In truth, Monet had survived an incredible series of ordeals, including enslavement at the hands of her brother Emplate. As a result, M became self-reliant and outwardly harsh and defensive to make up for her fear and insecurity. The only person she allowed to see her vulnerabilities was her teammate [[Everett Thomas (Earth-616)|Synch]], with whom she started a brief romantic relationship.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 67|68}}

M was one of the most devastated of the Generation X team members when Synch sacrificed his life to stop an exploding bomb that had been placed at the academy by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]'s cruel sister, [[Adrienne Frost (Earth-616)|Adrienne]]. Soon after Synch's death, the team rapidly began to fall apart, even as Monet began to open up by acting a little more human and vulnerable around her fellow teammates. Following the bomb incident, Monet began to observe Emma Frost acting strangely villainous, causing the entire team to question her leadership abilities, particularly when combined with [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]]'s relapse into alcoholism following the death of his lover, [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggert]].{{r|Generation X Vol 1 67|70}}

===X-Corps & X-Corporation===
The team soon parted ways, and Monet declared that she was going home. Monet instead joined Banshee's new venture, [[X-Corps (Earth-616)|X-Corps]], with fellow former Generation X members [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]] and Jubilee, in order to look out for their former teacher, who was still suffering from the death of Moira. However, X-Corps was soon destroyed by [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 403|405}} and M joined the [[X-Corporation (Earth-616)|X-Corporation]]'s European branch located in [[Paris (France)|Paris]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 128|130}} Monet helped the X-Men battle [[Thomas Cassidy (Earth-616)|Black Tom Cassidy]] and the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] before returning to her duties at X-Corporation Europe.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 410|412}}

[[File:Monet St. Croix (Earth-616) from Uncanny X Men Vol 1 404 0001.jpg|thumb|150px|right|As a member of Banshee's X-Corps]]
When a train crashed in the [[Channel Tunnel]], Monet and her X-Corporation team went to investigate and help. They quickly discovered something strange, however. The train had in fact been carrying two sentinel super-soldiers, Weapons [[Zona Cluster-6 (Earth-616)|XII]] and [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|XIII]]. Weapon XII began attacking them. With the power to kill and take control over anyone he touched, the X-Corporation team was no match for him. [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] intervened, and were able to subdue him with help from Weapon XIII, now calling himself [[Fantomex]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 130}}

===X-Factor Investigations===
Following the events of [[Decimation|M-Day]], Monet then opted to join the motley crew of [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations]], a private detective agency run by [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]]. Monet then, later on, completed her first mission on the team; by telepathically tricking the famous actor, [[Jack Vaughn (Earth-616)|Jack Vaughn]], into confessing to the murder of [[Gloria Santiago (Earth-616)|Gloria Santiago]]'s sister [[Rachel Santiago (Earth-616)|Rachel]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 1|4}}

[[File:X-Factor Vol 3 44 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|180px|First costume]]
Afterward, Monet broke down and cried in Jamie's arms after empathizing with the victim, but quickly threatened to break him in half if he ever revealed her moment of "weakness".{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 4}} Later, in a therapy session with [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Doc Samson]], Monet stated that she had hid behind the "M" persona so that others would not see how vulnerable she had become due to the lengthy amount of time she was held captive by her brother.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 13}}

Monet also had a brief romantic fling with Madrox during this time. The tryst did not end well because Madrox was unsure whether he or his duplicate had slept with Monet while he or his duplicate slept with [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Theresa]] at the same time.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 10}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 13}}

Despite initially being mad at Theresa, the two realized their quarrel was illogical. Thus, Monet invited Theresa to go to Paris on a private jet and clear their minds together. After doing some shopping, they came across some anti-mutant riots. Later, finding themselves facing local authorities, they ended up fleeing the country in a hurry, bringing with them an ex-mutant named [[Nicole (Android) (Earth-616)|Nicole]], who'd supposedly lost her parents in the riots.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 14|16}} This girl was later revealed to be an android and part of an intricate plan to get rid of mutants for good, but [[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|Layla Miller]] dealt with it.{{r|{{cl|X-Factor Vol 3 22}}-[[X-Factor Vol 3 24|24]]}} Their trip together apparently brought both women closer together, and, when Theresa learnt she was pregnant, Monet was one of the first people she confided it to.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 28}}

When Terry's baby was revealed to be the son of a dupe and inadvertadly absorbed by Madrox, Terry entered a deep state of depression and Monet stood by her side through it all.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 39}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 41|42}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 200}} After Madrox returned to New York with [[Guido Carosella (Earth-616)|Guido Carosella]] (Strong Guy) to give Terry some space, Monet stayed with her friend, but eventually they closed X-Factor Investigations and went to Ireland so that Terry could "recapture her soul". Still, Monet felt she wasn't getting better and decided to travel to New York and try to convince Madrox to pay Terry a visit. This visit would force Monet to face her own demons, when Monet received the news that her father had been supposedly kidnapped by terrorists.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 200}}

[[File:X-Factor Vol 1 200 Maguire Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|180px|With the X-Factor Investigations Team in new costume]]
Despite her recurring undermining behavior towards Strong Guy,{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 38}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 41}} and clear lack of interest in him,{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 37}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 38}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 200}} he developed feelings for her{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 203}} and he offered to help her with her father's kidnapping, refusing any payment.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 201}} 

Using some old contacts, Guido got some intel about the kidnapping, and the pair headed to his last known location in South America. While approaching the destination, their plane was gunned down and Monet was taken by the sorcerer [[Karl Mordo (Earth-616)|Baron Mordo]], who was suffering from cancer and had used Cartier to lure Monet and siphon her life energy to heal himself. After Strong Guy caught up with them, they were attacked by [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar Trask]]'s forces and forced to set aside their differences for a moment. As the temple was about to be bombed by the forces outside, Monet agreed to help Mordo with his illness in exchange for teleporting them all back to New York.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 203|206}}

After arriving, however, Monet tricked Mordo by using her telepathy, and he left thinking himself cured.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 207}}

During a protest, Guido was shot by [[Noelle Blanc (Earth-616)|Ballistique]], who was trying to assassinate [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|Mayor J. Jonah Jameson]], and his injuries were exacerbated when a Mandroid fell on him. As Monet flew him to the hospital, he professed his love for her. Unfortunately, his wound proved fatal, and he died in the hospital.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 217|218}}

Layla Miller used her reanimation powers to secretly bring him back to life, much to the astonishment of X-Factor and [[Doctor Castillo (Earth-616)|Doctor Castillo]]. In reality, she could bring people back, but not their souls, something which Monet quickly began to notice, starting with Guido getting cocky after their kiss.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 218|219}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 222|223}}

Nonetheless, Guido convinced Monet to go out with him,{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 239}} however, their date went bad after he ditch Monet to get involved in a fight.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 240}} Later, while on a mission to fight an [[Dormammu (Earth-TRN196)|alternate version of Dormammu]], Guido risked the life of a civillian, causing Monet to yell at him and call him a soulless monster. Guido got fed up and left X-Factor after being recruited by a mysterious figure.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 241}}

Monet was later dying from a serious brain injury inflicted when she fought [[Hades (Earth-616)|Pluto]] and was mercilessly beaten near to death until Wolfsbane's son [[Tier Sinclair (Earth-616)|Tier]] intervened and killed Pluto.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 253}} Later, in a fight with Strong Guy, M died due to the brain injury but was subsequently resurrected by Guido when he became Lord of Hell.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 255|256}}

Afterward, Monet found [[Armando Mu√±oz (Earth-616)|Darwin]] in [[Las Vegas]]. They had drinks at a bar, and Darwin finally admitted his feeling towards her only to be rejected. As Darwin left the bar, Monet aggressively cornered him and told him that she needed to feel something after her experience with death. The two ended up having sex. Darwin knew that Monet was not mentally prepared for a relationship, but was happy to be there.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 261}}

===X-Men===
After the [[Hell on Earth War|Hell on Earth]] incident that ended X-Factor, Monet found herself at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]] as a sort of retreat from the life of superheroing and to wind down from her recent death and rebirth. The traumatic experiences helped her form a kinship with the also recently brain-dead and depowered [[Karima Shapandar (Earth-616)|Karima]]. During a quick and quiet little jog in the woods both she and Karima were attacked by a whole new Deathstrike, backed by her hired guns. In an impressive telekinetic display, they single-handedly averted their attackers.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 7}}

[[File:Monet St. Croix (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 4 14 0001.png|thumb|left|180px|X-Men Costume]]
After getting a better look at and into the mind of their assailant, Deathstrike had to withdraw in the event that her new form still wasn't ready for combat. Monet, initially tempted to follow in pursuit, had her attention turned towards a wounded Karima, injured during the firefight, needing M to rush her back to the school where she officially joined with Storm's new X-Men team.{{citation}}

While on a scouting job in [[Budapest]] to find their adversary, where the first [[Arkea (Earth-616)|Arkea]] piece latched onto baby [[Shogo Lee (Earth-616)|Shogo]], an alarm went off alerting Monet, [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel]], and the others to the reactivation of their believed to be dead enemy. Having been booted back up by a new [[Sisterhood of Mutants]], which initially had been organized under Yuriko/Ana, but then seceded leadership under the parasitic disease in exchange for upgrades.{{citation}}

Monet tore out of Budapest at Mach 3 in order to reach [[Dubai]] where the new [[Body Shop]] and the lair of the Sisterhood was, only to have a brief scuffle with and eventually be subdued by a now repowered [[Amora (Earth-616)|Enchantress]]. Deathstrike's alien possessed [[Reiko (Earth-616)|Tech assistant]] had recently sent out a type of distress beacon that reactivated numerous non-functioning [[Sentinels]] to battle with the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 9}}

===Magneto's X-Men===
In the wake of the [[M-Pox]] crisis, Monet had joined the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] and, when [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] was invited to become part of the Inner Circle again, Monet was there to meet him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 12}} Later, she also became a member of his new team of [[X-Men (Magneto's) (Earth-616)|X-Men]], with the goal of protecting mutantkind at any cost. She developed an odd relationship with [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]], whom she frequently teased. They went on a mission together to find and protect [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]] due to the [[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Dark Riders]] assassinating mutant healers, further dooming their kind to the [[M-Pox]]. They made it to Elixir in time but he exposed himself against the Dark Riders to save people and was gunned down. A devastated Monet then sat beside his body.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 1|2}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 11 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Monet falls under hard times as a member of Magneto's X-Men]]
Afterwards, she was contacted by a mysterious source who needed her help. She took Sabretooth with her as the two waited to meet the person pleading their help. It turned out to have been [[Callisto (Earth-616)|Callisto]] who contacted Monet, but concealed the reason why when she saw Sabretooth, who she attacked for his part in the [[Mutant Massacre]]. Monet separated the two and demanded Callisto put her vendetta aside and explain why they were there. It turned out there remained a mysterious illness and series of abductions that befell the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 6}}

Emplate, Monet's brother, was responsible for the attacks. She confronted him, planning to fight and distract him long enough for him to fade away to his own dimension again. However, he managed to merge with Monet at the last second, cursing her with his hunger. Knowing she wished to hide her curse, Emplate warned her that he would only cooperate if she fed him. Sabretooth promised to keep her secret and offered to let her feed on him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 7|10}}

During a [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|war between the Inhumans and the X-Men]], M and Sabretooth became part of the mutants who guarded over the Inhumans captive in [[Limbo (Otherplace)|Limbo]]. But Monet had grown more malicious under Emplate's influence and began killing the Inhumans in cold-blood, blaming them for the [[Terrigen Mist]] and the death of Madrox. Sabretooth tried to stop her assault on the Inhumans, but in the end, let her kill the last one to keep her secret. He ran away with M, wanting to help her contain Emplate's possession and find a cure.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 17}}

===M-Plate===
At some point, Victor left Monet,{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 24}} and she set up base in an abandoned subway car beneath [[Central Park]], where [[George Baker (Earth-616)|D.O.A.]] brought her Morlocks to feed on but Emplate argued they needed more than just Morlocks to sustain them. M silenced him by crushing his tongue in her hand, saying she was coming up with a long-term solution.{{r|Generation X Vol 2 8}} M-Plate attacked the Xavier Institute in an attempt to feed on the students, having mapped out a perfect plan. She ordered D.O.A. to use his power to de-sync the school from the outside world, eliminating the possibility of outside interference or anyone being able to contact help.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 85}}

[[File:Generation X Vol 2 8 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Hard times continue as Monet is lost to Emplate]]
M-Plate engaged in a brief fight with the vampiric Jubilee until she ripped off the latter's amulet and tossed her into the sunlight to burn, leading [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]] to sacrifice his piece of [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix shard]] to restore Jubilee's powers and cure her vampirism.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 86}}

[[Nathaniel Carver (Earth-616)|Hindsight]] then came up with a plan to turn M-Plate's ability against her, by making her absorb his ability to see the past of whomever he touched. Every time Monet touched someone, her link with Emplate would weaken, so [[Roxanne Washington (Earth-616)|Bling!]] yelled for everyone to grab M-Plate, which flooded Monet's mind and made her lose composure, finally separating her from Emplate. Marius weakly faded away to his own dimension and Monet was taken to the infirmary, though she insisted she was fine and only needed a manicure and a blowout.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 87}}

===Weapon X-Force===
At some point, Monet fell under the mind-control of [[Marvin Flumm (Earth-616)|Mentallo]] and joined the cult known as [[Church of Human Potential (Aspen)|The Church of Human Potential]] which was lead by a [[Cyborgs|cyborg]]-enhanced [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Reverend William Stryker]]. Her first order of business was to lure [[Weapon X-Force (Earth-616)|Weapon X-Force]] to [[Aspen (Colorado)|Aspen]], [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]] so she could share the gift with Sabretooth. She was finally freed by Deathstrike and joined the team to bring down the Church. Initially, she & Victor were awkward around each other, something which Domino & [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] teased them about, believing they had feelings for each other. They finally addressed their fallout when Victor apologized for not being with her during her curse, although Monet didn't blame him. A giant heart shined behind them as Victor prepared to tell her something, but he was interrupted by [[Arkady Rossovich (Earth-616)|Omega Red]] before he could.{{r|{{cl|Weapon X Vol 3 22}}-[[Weapon X Vol 3 24|24]]}}
[[File:Weapon X Vol 3 27 Textless.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Monet & Victor in Weapon X-Force]]

As the battle continued into the depths of Hell & back, Sabretooth was killed by a power-boosted Mentallo as the final sacrifice in resurrecting Stryker, which devastated Monet.

[[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]] and Husk were killed, but the survivors continued onward.

Merging their powers, the Five were able make new husk bodies of the deceased mutants, restoring their powers, consciousness, and memories as they were at the time of their deaths. They were later acclaimed as heroes of Krakoa.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}} Monet was later seen in a village with the X-students and younger mutants, reprimanding Nicole and Claudette for trying their Penance forms.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 1}}

* [[Scott Lobdell|Scott Lobdell]], the creator of M and Penance, never intended for there to be a "real" M - only the St. Croix twins. Instead, Penance was simply meant to be a sixteen-year-old survivor of the war in Yugoslavia, and had been deaf since birth. Moreover, Emplate was not to be related to Monet nor the twins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarbombs.com/genx/lobdell.htm|title=Interview with Scott Lobdell|work=Sugar Bombs|first=Nate|last=Raymond|date=24 March 2019|accessdate=17 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://epicmarvelpodcast.com/interview-lobdell/|title=Interview: Scott Lobdell on Generation X|work=The Epic Marvel Podcast|first=Kurtis|last=Findlay|date=|accessdate=17 September 2020}}</ref>
** The idea to have Penance be the "real" Monet was actually none of the writers‚Äô, but editorial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarbombs.com/genx/lhama.htm|title=Interview with Larry Hama|work=Sugar Bombs|first=Linkun|last=|date=|accessdate=17 September 2020}}</ref>
* Monet revealed to Doctor Samson that she has suicidal thoughts every day of her life due to the trauma that she suffered at the hands of her brother Marius.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 13}}
* In early appearances, Monet had a much darker skin color than how she was portrayed in the 2000s.<br/>This was referenced, in response to a fan, on the letters page of {{cl|X-Factor Vol 3 4}}:<blockquote>"Monet's skin tone, and what it should be, set off a flurry of researching into her history. And boy, it was confusing and rife with contradictions. Bottom line, although Monet has very dark skin, we're not entirely sure she's African-anything. Nevertheless, we're likely darkening her skin a bit."</blockquote>
* Though Monet's baseline strength is higher than that of her teammate, Strong Guy, her strength stat (4) is still two points underneath his own (6).
* Some fans have theorized that Monet's powers are completely psionic in nature, not physical, meaning her strength and durability was always a form of tactile telekinesis, similar to DC's Kon-El/Superboy. This theory remains untested and unconfirmed, however.
* During ''[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 4|Uncanny X-Men]]'', Monet developed a close but rocky relationship with Sabretooth that writer [[Cullen Bunn|Cullen Bunn]] described as a torturous love.{{r|{{cite web|url= https://twitter.com/cullenbunn/status/1009239337588940803|title= That was some torturous love|work= Twitter|last= Bunn|first= Cullen|date= June 20, 2018|accessdate= December 23, 2018}}}}
