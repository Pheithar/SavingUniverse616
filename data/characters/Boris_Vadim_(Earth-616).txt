| History                 = Boris Vadim was a member of the Russian super-team [[Winter Guard (Earth-616)|Winter Guard]], who faced [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Doc Samson]] and [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] while they were investigating the assassination of [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Emil Blonsky]], the Abomination in Russia. 

He later helped [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] to combat Skrull forces during the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]] on Earth.{{r|Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 34}}

Seeking political asylum, he flew to the USA and joined [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]]'s mercenary group [[Code Red (Earth-616)|Code Red]].

| Notes                   = * {{cl|Hulk Vol 2 1}} might not be the first appearance of this Crimson Dynamo. Considering the number of unnamed Crimson Dynamos, this is merely the first fully confirmed appearance of Vadim. 
* "Vadim" was first given as his name in {{cl|She-Hulk Vol 2 35}} and "Boris" was given as his name in {{cl|Hulk Vol 2 14}}, making his likely name "Boris Vadim," although "Vadim" is not a Russian surname, it's a first name and can be used as a surname very seldom (like George Michael etc.). This was confirmed in {{cl|Official Index to the Marvel Universe Vol 1 14}}'s entry for {{cl|Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 34}}.
