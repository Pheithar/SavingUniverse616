===Origins===
Years after the [[Pride (Earth-616)|Pride]] was formed, [[Janet Stein (Earth-616)|Janet Stein]] accidentally conceived a child. This unexpected pregnancy led to the decision of each couple within the Pride conceiving one child and passing on their inheritance from the [[Gibborim]] to their children.{{r|Runaways Vol 1 13}} 

During an annual gathering of their parents at the Wilder's Mansion in [[Malibu (California)|Malibu]], [[Alex Wilder (Earth-616)|Alex Wilder]] used the secret passage he had discovered to spy on his parents and witnessed the human sacrifice during the Ritual of Blood. Alex began learning all he could about the Pride and accidentally discovered a secret pact between the Deans and Hayes to betray and murder the other.{{r|Runaways Vol 1 17}} 

The next year, during the same annual gathering of their parents, Alex intentionally led [[Nico Minoru (Earth-616)|Nico Minoru]], [[Chase Stein (Earth-616)|Chase Stein]], and [[Gertrude Yorkes (Earth-616)|Gertrude Yorkes]] to accidentally witness their parents murdering a [[Destiny Gonzales (Earth-616)|young woman]] during the Ritual of Blood while [[Karolina Dean (Earth-616)|Karolina Dean]] and [[Molly Hayes (Earth-616)|Molly Hayes]] waited upstairs.{{r|Runaways Vol 1 1}} The children decided to keep quiet until they could meet privately.{{r|Runaways Vol 1 2}}

===Running Away===
[[File:Hostel (Bronson Canyon) from Runaways Vol 1 6 001.png|thumb|right|250px|Chase introduces everyone to the Hostel]]
Nico, Gert, Chase, Karolina, and Alex met at the [[Griffith Observatory]] and collectively decided to find evidence to implicate their parents in murder. Using Chase Stein's Van, the group went to Yorkes where they found a [[Old Lace (Earth-TRN846)|dinosaur]]{{r|Runaways Vol 1 2}} with a [[Telepath|telepathic link]] to Gert and a mysterious book called the [[Abstract (Book)|Abstract]]. The group then traveled to the Deans home where they learned Karolina was an alien.{{r|Runaways Vol 1 3}} The group next traveled to the Steins where they discovered Victor's workshop and procured the [[Fistigons]] and [[X-Ray Specs]]. They were also ambushed by the Minorus and Steins but were able to obtain the [[Staff of One]] in the process.{{r|Runaways Vol 1 4}} The group's final stop was to rescue Molly from the Hayes where Alex also secured [[Ring of the Abstract]]. In an effort to get their children back, the Pride framed them for the murder of [[Destiny Gonzales (Earth-616)|Destiny Gonzales]] and the kidnapping of Molly Hayes. With nowhere left to run, the group took shelter in Chase's [[Hostel (Bronson Canyon)|Hostel]], a 1920s mansion buried during an earthquake in Bronson Canyon.{{r|Runaways Vol 1 6}}

[[File:Runaways (Earth-616) from Runaways Vol 1 6 002.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Runaways inside the Hostel in Bronson Canyon]]
During a food run the group stumbled upon a store robbery, and after thwarting the adult robbers, the Runaways recruited [[Topher (Earth-616)|Topher]].{{r|Runaways Vol 1 7}} Once they returned to the Hostel, Topher revealed he was a [[Vampire|vampire]] and began attacking.{{r|{{cl|Runaways Vol 1 8}}-[[Runaways Vol 1 9|9]]}} To save Nico, Karolina offered herself to Topher, who died after biting Karolina due to her blood being infused with solar energy.{{r|Runaways Vol 1 10}}

Continuing to search for the children, [[Lieutenant Flores (Earth-616)|Lieutenant Flores]] hired [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] & [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] unknowingly against the wishes of the Pride. After a brief confrontation with the Runaways, the pair learned the truth and promised to contact the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. However, Alex was able to tip off the Pride, who ambushed Cloak and Dagger and telepathically removed all memory of the meeting.{{r|{{cl|Runaways Vol 1 11}}-[[Runaways Vol 1 12|12]]}}

[[File:Runaways (Earth-616) from Runaways Vol 1 14 001.jpg |thumb|right|300px|Karolina rescuing the others from the destruction of the Hostel]]
To forward his plans, Alex informed the [[Los Angeles Police Department (Earth-616)|LAPD]] of the location of the Hostel. The Runaways narrowly escaped the destruction of the Hostel and began plotting to take their parents down. The Runaways entered the [[Marine Vivarium]] and disrupted the ceremony that would give the Gibborim the power to destroy humanity. After engineering the defeat of his friends, Alex revealed himself as the mole and detailed his plans. Nico angrily refused Alex's offer to live in paradise and fighting ensued. It ended when Molly destroyed the container containing Destiny's and freeing her, Alex being killed by the Gibborim, Chase rescuing the other with the [[Leapfrog (Vehicle)|Leapfrog]], and the deaths of all the Pride's members in the destruction of the Marine Vivarium.{{r|{{cl|Runaways Vol 1 13}}-[[Runaways Vol 1 17|17]]}}

With their parents dead, Social Services separated the Runaways. Three months after the destruction of the Pride, Karolina organized a reunion at the [[Griffith Observatory]], where each of them expressed their annoyance and hatred towards their current living conditions. Together the team rescued [[Old Lace (Earth-TRN846)|Old Lace]] and stole the [[Leapfrog (A.I.) (Earth-616)|Leapfrog]], and ran away again.{{r|Runaways Vol 1 18}}

===Victor Mancha and Xavin===
[[File:Hostel (La Brea Tar Pits) 002.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Runaways' new [[Hostel (La Brea Tar Pits)|Hostel]], beneath the [[La Brea Tar Pits]]]]
The Runaways eventually located [[Hostel (La Brea Tar Pits)|one of the Pride's old lairs]] beneath the [[La Brea Tar Pits]], and took up residence there. They also began defending [[Los Angeles]] from all of the villains trying to fill the power vacuum left by the absence of the Pride.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 1}}

[[File:4-D Time Portico from Runaways Vol 2 1 0001.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Gertrude Yorkes (Earth-5421)|Heroine]] traveling to her past with a warning]]
After an unsuccessful mission to rescue [[Ricky Calusky (Earth-616)|Excavator]] from his [[Brian Calusky (Earth-616)|father]] and the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]], the team returned to the Hostel to be confronted by a mortally wounded [[Gertrude Yorkes (Earth-5421)|Heroine]], a woman claiming to Gert's future self and leader of the [[Avengers (Earth-5421)|Avengers]]. Using the [[4-D Time Portico]], she narrowly escaped the onslaught of [[Victor Mancha (Earth-5421)|Victorious]], with a message to the Runaways: find [[Victor Mancha (Earth-616)|Victor Mancha]] and stop him from becoming this deadly super-villain.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 1}} 

The Runaways were able to find [[Victor Mancha (Earth-616)|Victor Mancha]] despite interference from [[Loners (Earth-616)|Excelsior]].{{r|{{cl|Runaways Vol 2 2}}-[[Runaways Vol 2 3|3]]}} With the discovery of his [[Glossary:Electrokinesis|electro]][[Magnetokinesis|magnetokinetic]] powers, the revelation that his father is [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]], the prophecy of his dark future, and the death of [[Marianella Mancha (Earth-616)|his mother]], Victor joined the Runaways and took up residence with them beneath the La Brea Tar Pits.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 6}}

Just as the group was adjusting to this new normal, a [[Super-Skrull|Super-Skrull-in-Training]] name [[Xavin (Earth-616)|Xavin]] arrived. After a brief firefight and high-speed chase, Xavin was able to explain about the pact the Deans had made with Xavin's father: in exchange for sparing the Earth from a [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]], the Deans would offer the location of [[Majesdane]] and their daughter's hand in marriage. The information provided by the Deans launched a full-scale war between the [[Skrulls]] and [[Majesdanian]]s prompting Xavin to travel to Earth in hopes that a marriage between the races would end the hostilities. Karolina agreed to accompany Xavin and end the Skrull-Majesdanian conflict after Xavin shape-shifted into a female form to suit Karolina's sexual preference.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 #7|8}}

Shortly after [[Decimation|M-Day]], the Runaways were approached by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], who were hoping to recruit Molly to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] to learn and train alongside her fellow [[Homo Superior|mutants]]. Although a fight broke out, the X-Men accepted Molly's decision to remain with her friends, but also left the invitation open.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2006 X-Men Runaways}}

The Runaways briefly visited [[New York City]] when they were recruited by [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] to rescue [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]] and clear his name. While there they encountered [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]]. After tracking down a [[Pusher Man (Earth-616)|MGH dealer]] the Runaways were able to [[Reginald Mantz (Earth-616)|Reginald Mantz]] and prove that he was impersonating Cloak.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 #9|#12}}

The Runaways continued to defend L.A. from villains like [[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Mole-Man]],  [[Fritz von Meyer (Earth-616)|Swarm]], [[Tarantula (Runaways) (Earth-616)|Tarantula]],{{r|Runaways Vol 2 7}} [[Karl Morgenthau (Earth-616)|Flag-Smasher]],{{r|Civil War: Young Avengers and Runaways Vol 1 1}} and the [[Silver Bullet Gang (Earth-616)|Silver Bullet Gang]].{{r|Runaways Vol 2 23}} Once, after a battle with [[Tamara Kurtz (Earth-616)|Dragonness]], Molly was knocked unconscious and "recruited" by the [[Provost (Earth-616)|Provost]] to his ring of child thieves. Molly was able to inspire her fellow captives and together defeated the Provost.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 13}}

===The New Pride===
Shortly after Alex's death, a group of his online friends joined together to perform a spell to resurrect Alex. However, the spell killed [[Oscar (Earth-616)|Oscar]] and summoned a young [[Geoffrey Wilder (Earth-616)|Geoffrey Wilder]] from the 1980s.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 14}} Under Wilder's leadership, [[Hunter (Pride) (Earth-616)|Hunter]], [[Lotus (Pride) (Earth-616)|Lotus]], and [[Stretch (Earth-616)|Stretch]] formed a new Pride and began plotting to complete the Pride's work.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 14}} This included Wilder posing as [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]] to infiltrate [[Loners (Earth-616)|Excelsior]]{{r|Runaways Vol 2 6}} and hacking into Victor's operating system to spy on the Runaways. Their plans came to a head one evening when they lured the Runaways out to the suburbs, took control of Victor, and revealed that Nico and Chase had secretly kissed. During the ensuing chaos and infighting, the Pride was able to kidnap Molly Hayes.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 15}} It was only through the return of Karolina and Xavin{{r|Runaways Vol 2 17}} that the team was able to rescue Molly from being sacrificed to the Gibborim. Unfortunately, the Runaways paid a high price for Gert's life.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 18}}

[[File:Xavin (Earth-616) and Karolina Dean (Earth-616) from Runaways Vol 2 20 001.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Xavin and Karolina rejoin the Runaways]]
In the aftermath, Chase departed with Old Lace and the Abstract, the Pride disbanded, Wilder was returned to the 1980s with no memories of the future, and the Runaways buried Gert behind the Hollywood sign before returning to the Hostel to mourn.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 18}} While Molly searched for answers about death, Nico and Victor secretly began hooking up, and Karolina attempted to ease Xavin's transition into life on Earth.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 19}} Meanwhile, Chase abducted Lotus to force her to help him contact the Gibborim.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 20}} After rescuing downtown Los Angeles from a giant monster, the Runaways were rejoined by Chase.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 21}} 

[[File:Runaways (Earth-616) 005.jpg|300px|left|thumb|The Runaways ambushed by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and his [[Superhuman Restraint Unit (Earth-616)|Cape-Killers]]]]
[[File: Civil War Young Avengers and Runaways Vol 1 1 through 4 Textless.jpg|550px|thumb|left|The Runaways team up with the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]]]]
Although they attempted to stay out of the [[Civil War|Superhero Civil War]], [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D. forces]] began enforcing the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] in [[California (State)|California]]. When the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] arrived to recruit the Runaways, a brawl soon broke out.{{r|Civil War: Young Avengers and Runaways Vol 1 1}} The fighting was halted by a misfired spell and the arrival of [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Marvel Boy]]. Under the direction of the [[Cube Warden (Earth-616)|Warden of the]] [[Cube]], Marvel Boy disposed of most of the teams and captured [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]], [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]], Karolina, and Xavin.{{r|Civil War: Young Avengers and Runaways Vol 1 3}} It was only through the combined efforts of both teams that they were able to save their friends.{{r|Civil War: Young Avengers and Runaways Vol 1 4}}

Sometime later, Chase began to finalize his plans to resurrect Gert by offering himself as a sacrifice. Using pages stolen from the Abstract, Chase deactivated Victor and stole the [[Staff of One]].{{r|Runaways Vol 2 23}} With Alex' anonymous help, Molly was able to help the team find Chase, reactivate Victor, and help the others save Chase from offering himself to the Gibborim. Unfortunately, when the group returned to the Hostel they found [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and his [[Superhuman Restraint Unit (Earth-616)|Cape-Killers]] waiting for them.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 24}}

===Time Travelers===
The Runaways narrowly managed to escape from Iron Man and began to head east to [[New York City]].{{r|Runaways Saga Vol 1 1}} In New York, they met with a former associate of their parents, [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]], who offered the team protection from the government if they stole [[4-D Time Portico|an artifact]] for him. The team successfully stole the item but were confronted by the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]]{{r|Runaways Vol 2 25}} then a [[Tristan (Street Arabs) (Earth-616)|winged monster]] then an army of Kingpin's ninjas. The group only barely escaped when Chase plugged the [[4-D Time Portico|Overdrive]] into the Leapfrog transporting them back to 1907.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 26}}

[[File:Runaways (Earth-616) 010.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Runaways in 1907 [[New York City]]]]
While in the past, the group became involved in a conflict between the [[Street Arabs (Earth-616)|Street Arabs]], the [[Upward Path (Earth-616)|Upward Path]], and the [[Sinners (Earth-616)|Sinners]]. In an effort to find a way home the team splits up. Victor and [[Lillie McGurty (Earth-616)|Spieler]] went to consult with [[Professor Duck (Earth-616)|Professor Duck]] and began to develop a romantic attraction. Meanwhile, Nico was abducted by the Upward Path where she met a distance ancestor, [[Witchbreaker (Earth-616)|Witchbreaker]]. Chase and Xavin encountered younger versions of [[Dale Yorkes (Earth-TRN845)|Dale]] and [[Stacey Yorkes (Earth-TRN845)|Stacey Yorkes]], and Chase used the opportunity to steal their [[4-D Time Portico]] to rescue Gert from the past before she was killed. Elsewhere, Karolina and Molly sought out [[Klara Prast (Earth-616)|Klara Prast]], a Swiss immigrant and child-bride of [[Mr. Prast (Earth-616)|an alcoholic and abusive man]], in hopes of recruiting her to the Runaways to rescue her from her husband.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 #27|#29}}

Events finally culminated with a large battle between the three factions of [[Glossary:Superhuman|Wonders]]. During the chaos of the battle, the Runaways were able to regroup and escape with plans to bring both Klara and Spieler to the future with them. Unfortunately, before they could escape, they were confronted by the Yorkes. It was only through the timely arrival of Chase in the 4-D Time Portico sporting a new set of [[Fistigons]] that they were able to board the Leapfrog and return to the future except for Spieler who decided to remain in 1907.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 30}}

Upon returning to present-day New York, the Runaways encountered the beginning of the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] of Earth. Shocked by the events and wanting to protect his friends, Xavin immediately knocked out the others and attempted to bring them to safety. However, Xavin became distracted with Nico and Victor's regaining consciousness and witnessing [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Dorrek VIII]] being attacked by Skrull forces. Departing from the others, Xavin tried to help [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] and [[Thomas Shepherd (Earth-616)|Speed]] save Hulklings life. While trying to evade [[X'iv (Earth-616)|X'iv]] and [[Chrell (Earth-616)|Chrell]], Xavin and the others were joined by the rest of the Runaways. Together they defeated the [[Super-Skrulls]] allowing the Runaways to run away from the war in New York.{{r|{{cl|Secret Invasion: Runaways/Young Avengers Vol 1 1}}-[[Secret Invasion: Runaways/Young Avengers Vol 1 3|3]]}}

===Return to L.A.===
When the team finally returned to [[California (State)|California]], they took up residence in the [[Malibu House]], and Chase was forced to get a job to help support the others. Not long after settling in, the Runaways were attacked by the [[Majesdanian]] [[Light Brigade (Majesdane) (Earth-616)|Light Brigade]] looking to punish Karolina for the crimes of her parents that led to the destruction of [[Majesdane]]. Against her wishes, Xavin (disguised as Karolina) took her place and agreed to be tried for her crimes.{{r|Runaways Vol 3 #1|#6}} Shortly after losing Xavin, the Runaways faced off against [[Val Rhymin (Earth-616)|Val Rhymin]], [[Monk Theppie (Earth-616)|Monk Theppie]], and their army of plastic surgery "zombies".{{r|Runaways Vol 3 #7|#9}}

[[File:Malibu House 001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Runaways outside the [[Malibu House]]]]

After the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] relocated to the east coast, they sent out a [[Telepath|telepathic]] message to [[Homo Superior|mutants]] around the globe inviting them to come to [[San Francisco]]. To stop the message from repeating in her head, Molly and the other Runaways visited [[Graymalkin Industries]]. The X-Men again tried to recruit Molly and she again declined.{{r|Runaways Vol 3 10}}

Tragedy struck when an unmanned drone plane crashed into the Malibu house, demolishing the house, destroying the Leapfrog's body, and seemingly killing Old Lace.{{r|Runaways Vol 3 11}} It was only through the intervention of Chase's [[Hunter Stein (Earth-616)|Uncle Hunter]] that the Runaways were able to evade arrest by the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Army]]. Hunter led the Runaways to a new fleet of Leapfrogs, and he and Victor were able to install the Leapfrog's "heart" into a new vessel.{{r|Runaways Vol 3 13}} Hunter also offered to support the Runaways, but while en route to meet with Hunter, Chase was hit by a car.{{r|Runaways Vol 3 14}} Chase did, however, make a full recovery.{{r|Daken: Dark Wolverine Vol 1 18}}

[[File:Runaways (Earth-616) Daken (Akihiro) (Earth-616) Daken Dark Wolverine Vol 1 17.png|thumb|200px|left|The Runaways attacking [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]]]]
When [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]] discovered that an associate of the [[Pride (Earth-616)|Pride]] was apparently the source of the [[Heat Pills|Heat drugs]], he went searching for, and found, the Runaways.{{r|Daken: Dark Wolverine Vol 1 17}} Daken learned of [[Marcus Roston (Earth-616)|Marcus Roston]]'s falling out with the Pride,{{r|Daken: Dark Wolverine Vol 1 18}} and was able to manipulate the Runaways into helping him take down Rouston.{{r|Daken: Dark Wolverine Vol 1 19}}

[[File:Return of Old Lace (Earth-TRN846).jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Old Lace (Earth-TRN846)|Old Lace]] reunited with the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]]]]
When Chase began sensing Old Lace was still alive, a spell from Nico led the team to [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]] and [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-616)|Reptil]]. With his help, Chase and the Runaways traveled to [[Earth-78411|Dinosaur World]] and were reunited with Old Lace.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 27}} Although there was some conflict over letting the kids remain unsupervised, the Runaways were able to leave on good terms with [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Dr. Pym]] and the Avengers Academy.{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 28}}

===Murderworld===
[[File:Nico Minoru (Earth-616) and Chase Stein (Earth-616) from Avengers Arena Vol 1 4 002.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Nico and Chase on [[Murderworld]]]]
[[Chase Stein (Earth-616)|Chase]] and [[Nico Minoru (Earth-616)|Nico]] were among the sixteen superpowered teens captured and brought to [[Murderworld]] by [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] where they were pitted against each other in a fight to the death.{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 1}} As a cover story, Arcade left a note from Nico and Chase stating they needed time to explore their relationship. Arcade also sent periodic texts to the Runaways though all these efforts did not convince Molly that they left of their own free will.{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 13}} During their absence, Victor joined briefly joined Pym's [[Avengers Artificial Intelligence Squad (Earth-616)|Avengers A.I.]] team.{{r|Avengers A.I. Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Runaways (Earth-616), Avengers Academy (Earth-616), Braddock Academy (Earth-616) in Avengers Arena Vol 1 10.png|200px|thumb|The Runaways and other Murderworld survivors relaxing at a lake]]
Chase and Nico both survived Murderworld, but not without trauma. Chase gained the [[Darkhawk Amulet]] and briefly but inadvertently transformed into the new [[Darkhawk]],{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 4}} and Nico actually died and was resurrected by the Staff of One.{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 10}}{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 12}} Along with the other survivors, Chase and Nico agreed to the pact of silence about what really happened on Murderworld.{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 18}}

[[File:Runaways (Earth-616) from Avengers Undercover Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Victor, Karolina, and Molly watch Chase and Nico's argument on television]]
Although Chase and Nico both returned from Murderworld, only Chase returned home to their friends while Nico remained distant. After Arcade leaked video footage of Murderworld online, Chase broke the silence pact and began to capitalize on the notoriety and began appearing on numerous talk shows. However, six months after Murderworld, Chase and Nico left again accompanied by the other Murderworld survivors to enter [[Bagalia]] in search of their friend [[Cullen Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Cullen]].{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 1}} They also agreed to infiltrate [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] to bring them down from the inside. The Masters of Evil resurrected Alex Wilder to help train Nico in the dark arts.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 5}} [[Rebecca Ryker (Earth-616)|Death Locket]] betrayed the group and shot Chase.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 6}} Fortunately, Nico healed him, but he remained in a coma for a few months. Nico also started hooking up with Alex.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 7}} The Masters of Evil trapped the Avengers Underground and Alex joined them as part of his deal to get out of hell.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 9}} Luckily, [[Camille Benally (Earth-616)|Cammi]] stopped them, then flew into space. The Runaways and the other Murderworld survivors got to relax at "some stupid lake somewhere."{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 10}}

===Find Your Way Home===
Sometime later, Nico left the team in order to travel to Japan to reconnect with members of her family, but her reunion was cut short by the arrival of [[Antimatter (Earth-616)|Antimatter]], and thus she became press-ganged into joining [[A-Force (Earth-616)|A-Force]].{{r|A-Force Vol 2 2}} After Nico's departure, Molly was approached by her grandmother, and she left with her of her own accord.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 2}} Victor became addicted to [[Vibranium]], which affected his powers and accidentally caused him to murder [[Vin (Earth-616)|Vin]], a creation of Victor's "brother" [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] and Victor's "nephew" during a mission on behalf of the Avengers.{{r|Vision Vol 2 9}} He was murdered by Vision's wife [[Virginia (Earth-616)|Virginia]] in retaliation.{{r|Vision Vol 2 11}} Klara also left, being taken by state officials into foster care. Chase and Karolina were the only remaining members of the team together, staying at a Pride hideout in Malibu, but Karolina eventually left{{r|Runaways Vol 5 2}} to go to college.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 3}}

Using the time machine that belonged to Gert's parents, Chase went back in time in an attempt to save her from dying. Though he failed to stop her from getting hurt in the first place, Chase retrieved Gert's body and returned to the present. He arrived to Nico's house, and using the Staff of One, Nico managed to save her life.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 1}} Furious after learning that her team had drifted apart, Gert rallied Nico and Chase to get the team together. Both Karolina and Molly initially declined,{{r|Runaways Vol 5 2|3}} but the team finally reunited to help Molly escape from her grandmother, who had turned out to be a mad scientist.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 5}} Victor returned in a way as well, since his dormant head had been delivered to Chase by Tony Stark, but he refrained from opening the package until after Gert returned.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 2}} Chase managed to kick-start Victor's consciousness, but due to the traumatic experience leading to his death, Victor refused to be attached to a new robot body.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 11|12}} The team made of their home the the underground main building of the Hostel,{{r|Runaways Vol 5 7}} since Chase had discovered the building they previously utilized was the Hostel's guesthouse and not the Hostel itself.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 2}} The Runaways also tried to get Klara back on the team, but she didn't want to leave her foster parents.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 11}} During this time, Karolina's girlfriend, [[Julie Power (Earth-616)|Julie Power]], broke up with her,{{r|Runaways Vol 5 10}} and Karolina started dating Nico not long afterwards. Gert and Victor also acted on their feelings for each other.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 12}}

The Runaways' new normal was shaken up the unwelcomed return of Alex Wilder heralding the arrival of the [[Seed of the Gibborim (Earth-616)|Seed of the Gibborim]], a trio of gods and the offsprings of the Gibborim who intended to make the Runaways follow through with the ritual the Pride had failed to perform. They forced the Runaways into house arrest and gave them a week to concede, leaving one of their own behind, [[Gib (Earth-616)|Gib]], to keep an eye on the teenagers.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 #13|14}} On the day of the deadline, Gib turned against his siblings, having become attached to the Runaways.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 17}} The other two offspring of the Gibborim, [[Bo (Gibborim) (Earth-616)|Bo]] and [[Rim (Earth-616)|Rim]], where defeated when Gert rammed them with her parents' time machine, banishing them into the future. Despite his opposition against his kin, Gib was disheartened by the loss of his siblings, and the Runaways welcomed him into the team. Since his former team remained spiteful of him, Alex quietly went away.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 18}} Following this misadventure, Victor decided to regrow his body with to better protect Gert.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 20}}

===The J-Team===
In hopes to find a sense of purpose, Karolina started dabbling in super-heroics,{{r|Runaways Vol 5 22}} and was quickly joined by Nico.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 24}} Karolina's exploits caught the attention of local hero [[Doc Justice (Earth-616)|Doc Justice]],{{r|Runaways Vol 5 25}} who welcomed the Runaways into his mansion when they were forced out of their underground home by an inadvertent public drainage work.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 26}} Unaware that Doc Justice thrived off sensationalizing his superhero life, the Runaways minus Gert accepted to operate as crime-fighters under his wing, becoming a new incarnation of the hero's former squad, the [[J-Team (Earth-616)|J-Team]].{{r|Runaways Vol 5 27}}

[[File:Runaways Vol 5 27 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|With Doc Justice as the J-Team]]

The unusually high mortality rate of former members of the J-Team led Gert to become increasingly suspicious of Doc Justice,{{r|Runaways Vol 5 29}} ultimately discovering that in the fifty years of his career, the hero routinely orchestrated the death of his young protégés to raise his own profile.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 30}} Gert convinced Doc Justice's son and assistant, [[Matthew Caniglia (Earth-616)|Matthew Caniglia]], to interrupt a staged mission that was intended to end with Karolina's murder. Although this encounter resulted in Doc Justice's death at the fangs of Old Lace, Karolina's inner solar power was almost fatally depleted.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 31}}

The team returned to the Hostel but their morale was battered by Doc Justice's betrayal, and the heroic [[Doombot (Avenger) (Earth-616)|Doombot]] friend of Victor moved in with the Runaways out of concern for the team's safety due to the fiasco. Gert decided to resume her high school studies, and was joined by Victor and Gib, the latter using his powers to manifest a human appearance.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 32}} The team was further shaken up by the concurrent arrivals of a version of Gert from the future and the Light Brigade. Future Gert wanted to take Chase to her future for a fresh start to prevent his descent into villainy, and the Light Brigade, having been drawn to Earth by the depletion of Karolina's light and no longer holding a grudge against her, offered to take her away to treat her injury. After present Gert and Molly helped future Gert force Chase into the future with her, Karolina agreed to leave Earth with the Light Brigade with the promise to return.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 38}}
