| History                 = 
===Early Life===
'''T'Challa''' was the first biological son of [[T'Chaka (Earth-616)|T'Chaka]], king of the African nation of [[Wakanda]], a secluded technologically advanced country that contained the only source of the rare ultra-durable metal known as [[Vibranium]]. His mother, [[N'Yami (Earth-616)|N'Yami]], died a week after giving birth to her son as a consequence of a rare autoimmune disease she had contracted during pregnancy.{{r|Rise of the Black Panther Vol 1 1}} T'Challa's adopted older brother, [[White Wolf (Hunter) (Earth-616)|Hunter]], blamed him for her death.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 10}}

T'Challa was taught the properties of Vibranium when he was still a kid, and his lessons in royal duty began at age five. When he accompanied his father on border inspection for the first time, T'Challa got lost, but was found by outsider explorer [[Ramonda (Earth-616)|Ramonda]]. After meeting T'Chaka, Ramonda remained in Wakanda and became a mother to T'Challa. He became the reason why Ramonda decided to stay in the country, and she ended up marrying T'Chaka.

During a ceremony held in the border of Wakanda, T'Chaka was approached by physicist [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Ulysses Klaw]], who attempted to petition for the mining rights of the nation's rare metal called Vibranium. Klaw was backed up by a group of mercenaries, who opened fire as soon as T'Chaka refused. When Klaw's sonic weapon overwhelmed his father, T'Challa ran to his aid. Klaw prepared to kill the young prince instead, but T'Chaka shielded him, and died. After Klaw was disarmed by [[Zuri (Earth-616)|Zuri]], T'Challa took his sonic blaster and maimed the invader's right hand, forcing him to retreat.{{r|Rise of the Black Panther Vol 1 1}} Not long afterwards, Ramonda left Wakanda abruptly. Only decades later did T'Challa learn she had been kidnapped and brought back to her native [[South Africa]].{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 13|37}}

When T'Challa was a teen, he was sent on the Wakandan rite of passage to roam the land. He saved a young orphan girl named [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Ororo Munroe]] from kidnappers, who then later used her [[Homo superior|mutant]] powers to control the weather to take out the same would-be kidnappers and killers when they came for him. The pair shared a romance and spent much time together, however, T'Challa's duties as a prince prevented them from further exploring their burgeoning mutual attraction.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 1 100}}{{r|{{cl|Storm Vol 2 2}}-[[Storm Vol 2 6|6]]}}{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 15}}

[[File:T'Challa (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 87.jpg|thumb|left|200px|T'Challa's Education]]
As a young man, T'Challa traveled to [[United States of America|America]]{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 6}} and [[Europe]] for school. [[B'Tumba (Earth-616)|B'Tumba]], his childhood friend, was sent by his father [[N'Baza (Earth-616)|N'Baza]] to study alongside him. While in the US T'Challa used the alias "Luke Charles" to remain incognito. It was during this time that he met another student [[Nicole Adams (Earth-616)|Nicole Adams]] and the two had a short romance.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 77}} Another student, [[Kamal Rakim (Earth-616)|Kamal Rakim]], was angered T'Challa was dating a white person and attacked the two. T'Challa was forced to defend himself and Nicole, easily taking down Kamal and his gang.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 6}} A similar incident would come up while meeting his future ally & fellow hero whom originally went by [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Carl Lucas]]. The two would get into a brief fight as the latter & his gangbanger buddies tried to rob him, ending when Lucas didn't like how T'Challa used a falsie alias, but took interest in the name 'Luke' irregardless. The former ruffian relenting as they exchanged good advice between themselves but refusing to shake Luke's hand when the college boy offered it in friendship.{{r|Rise of the Black Panther Vol 1 5}} He gained a Ph.D. in Physics from [[Oxford University]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 1}} Being bested at every sport and every endeavor, B'Tumba grew jealous and turned to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], plotting revenge against T'Chaka's son.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 87}}

===Return to Wakanda===
T'Challa came back to perform his duties in his tribe to become a man to lead the country. He was sent to find the sacred [[Heart-Shaped Herb]], whilst searching he was captured by A.I.M., B'Tumba was ordered to execute his friend, but since he couldn't do it, he freed T'Challa and joined him in battling the A.I.M. soldiers. During the combat, B'Tumba was fatally wounded, and after A.I.M. retreated, he apologized to Black Panther before dying.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 87}}

Two years before it was expected, T'Challa anonymously challenged his uncle [[S'Yan (Earth-616)|S'Yan]] for the throne,{{r|Rise of the Black Panther Vol 1 2}} and upon victory gained the mantle of the Black Panther from him. S'Yan happily stepped down, so his nephew could rule.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 2}} T'Challa then took a Heart-Shaped Herb to link himself to [[Bast (Earth-616)|Bast]], the Panther God. The herb also enhanced the new king, making him almost superhuman. As one of his first acts as King, T'Challa excommunicated his adopted brother, Hunter. As the White Wolf, Hunter had decades earlier assumed leadership of the [[Hatut Zeraze (Earth-616)|Hatut Zeraze]] ("Dogs of War"), zealous patriots who acted as the Wakandan Secret Police, performing acts of sedition, counter-intelligence, and assassination against the countries presumed enemies. T'Challa would not be a king who tolerated such actions, and so he officially disbanded the Hatut Zeraze, although in reality the Dogs and Hunter merely left Wakanda to operate on their own abroad.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 10}}

Being King continued to bring up new difficulties when a tribal war commenced in Wakanda. T'Challa was forced to take sides in the war, choosing [[Dora Milaje (Earth-616)|Dora Milaje]] over the [[Jabari Tribe (Earth-616)|Jabari Tribe]] for his secret service agents as well as his harem. The more Wakanda became a technological global power, the more T'Challa realized the threats of the outside world.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 8}}

===Encountering the Fantastic Four===
While developing nuclear weaponry inside Wakanda, he began to invite super-powered people to his country, beginning with the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 52}} Although, once he found out what kind of people they were, T'Challa saw them as allies as well as friends. They helped T'Challa defeat Klaw without taking his life.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 53}} In thanks, he played baseball with his new American friends.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 54}} T'Challa later sent a missile from Wakanda to the [[Baxter Building]], piercing the barrier. Inside, [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed]] removed the vibranium bands which he had radioed the Black Panther to send to him. Reed then used them to beat Klaw into submission. After the battle, Reed radioed T'Challa to thank him for helping them out.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 56}} T'Challa witnessed [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] travel the globe with the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]]'s stolen cosmic power.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 60}}

T'Challa led an army to [[Panther Island (Caribbean)|Panther Island]] in a battle against the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]]. He realized that they have mutual allies and that [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] brought the Inhumans because he sensed danger. Investigating, they came across the [[Psycho-Man (Earth-616)|Psycho-Man]]'s base and had to fight off his defenses. They found themselves overwhelmed and so they had [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]] bring the Fantastic Four to the Psycho-Man's base to turn the tide. There they battled their way to Psycho-Man, who revealed to them that he came from the [[Microverse]] and that he intended to take over this world with a giant [[Control-Box|emoto-caster]] weapon. Psycho-Man was subdued by all the heroes and Black Panther questioned him, only to find that he was actually a robot piloted by a tiny being.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 5}}

===Joining the Avengers===
Black Panther, under the identity of "Luke Charles", teamed up with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] to battle [[Franz Gruber (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]].{{r|Captain America Vol 1 100}} After defeating him Cap asked Black Panther to join the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 51}}

With the team he battled the [[Eric Williams (Earth-616)|Grim Reaper]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 52}} the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 53}}, the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 54}} led by [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron-5]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 55}} [[Nathaniel Richards (Scarlet Centurion) (Earth-6311)|Scarlet Centurion]],{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 2}} he even time traveled back to [[World War II]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 56}} he helped take down the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], Ultron's latest creation,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 57}} who later joined the team.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 58}} He fought also [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 59}} the [[Circus of Crime (Earth-616)|Circus of Crime]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 60}} and [[Surtur (Earth-616)|Surtur]] with [[Ymir (Earth-616)|Ymir]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 61}}

===Confronting the Man-Ape===
Black Panther and his allies traveled to Wakanda. There, they were greeted by an army of [[Wakandan Army (Earth-616)|Wakandan troops]] who attacked the other Avengers with guns until Black Panther stopped them. When asking them who authorized them to carry such weapons, they told the Panther that it was his chosen stand-in [[M'Baku (Earth-616)|M'Baku]] that gave the order. Angered, Black Panther called M'Baku to him. Having dinner, M'Baku explained that he ordered the troops to carry weapons because he had heard reports that Klaw was back in Wakanda. During their meal, Black Panther and his comrades were knocked out because M'Baku had drugged their food in hopes of taking over the nation of Wakanda. Waking, Black Panther found himself in costume, faced with M'Baku who was dressed as a white gorilla, a forbidden outfit in Wakanda. Calling himself the Man-Ape, M'Baku explained that he would kill T'Challa, take over the kingdom, and have everyone worship the white gorilla instead of the panther god. A battle waged on through the village of Wakanda, taking them to the atomic fire pits that power the small nation. There the Man-Ape almost fell into the pit, but Black Panther grabbed him. As he was pulling up his foe, the Man-Ape attacked and knocked him out. Later, T'Challa awoke strapped to an altar beneath the [[Panther Idol]]. Man-Ape then attempted to knock the statue onto the Black Panther in an effort to kill him and destroy the idol. Meanwhile, the other Avengers came to and broke out of their prison cell. The Man-Ape's plan backfired, as his efforts to knock down the statue caused it to crumble and fall on top of him while the Avengers freed T'Challa from his restraints. With T'Challa free and the Man-Ape apparently deceased, the battle was declared over.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 62}} 

Back at home, T'Challa battled [[Elihas Starr (Earth-616)|Egghead]], [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]], and the [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 63}} ultimately defeating the trio of villains,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 64}} then the team battled Egghead and the [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 65}} Panther and the team mourned the reported death of Captain America.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 113}}{{r|Captain America Vol 1 114}} He battled Ultron-6,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 68}} [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 69}} and the [[Squadron Sinister (Earth-616)|Squadron Sinister]] in the present{{r|Avengers Vol 1 70}} and in the distant future.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 71}}

===Sons of the Serpent===
On a trip back to [[New York City|New York]] from Wakanda, T'Challa learned that the [[Sons of the Serpent (Earth-616)|Sons of the Serpent]] had been targeting prominent black people in the city. After outspoken singer [[Monica Lynne (Earth-616)|Monica Lynne]] expressed her opinion about the Sons on the Serpents on [[Dan Dunn (Earth-616)|Dan Dunn]] show, she becomes their next target. The Serpents' activities attracted the attention of the Avengers, who recounted their previous encounter with the group to the Vision. When Monica Lynne was attacked by the Serpents, she was saved by Black Panther. She later appeared on the Dan Dunn show once more to continue to air her opinion about the Serpents which made her more of a target. When the Avengers planned to protect her, the Panther stopped them, deciding that he would protect the musician by himself. Approaching Lynne, the Black Panther asked her not appear on television again the following night, a request she refused. The Panther spent the rest of the night stalking the city searching for members of the Sons of the Serpent. When he found one member, he took him out and stole his uniform and slipped aboard their shuttle craft. He was soon taken to their base, a giant mechanical serpent hidden beneath the sea. However, there the Black Panther's cover was blown and he was unmasked by the Serpents who hold him at gunpoint.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 73}} The Avengers were alerted to a string of crimes that were apparently being caused by the Black Panther, which the Sons of the Serpent were using to fuel racial tensions in the city, by promising to unmask the Panther on national television, and expose his criminal nature. This caused the city to become split over the issue of race and tensions on the Dan Dunn show explode. The Avengers, seeking to get to the bottom of things, tracked down and battle the "Black Panther", who managed to distract the Avengers and escape. While recouping back at [[Avengers Mansion]], they soon saw on television that the Sons of the Serpent have "captured" Black Panther and were about to unmask him on television. The Avengers rushed to the station and battle the Sons of the Serpent. When the real Black Panther was freed, he revealed that the Black Panther "unmasked" by the Serpents was really an impostor. The masterminds behind the Sons of the Serpent were unmasked and revealed to be Dan Dunn and [[Montague Hale (Earth-616)|Montague Hale]]. It turned out their racism was an act intended to stir up hatred and violence that they could use to gain power. Although Hale was using "Black America" for his own ends, Monica Lynne and T'Challa point out that even though the leader was wrong, the cause was still right. They each admit that they have found a new purpose.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 74}}

The team battled [[Arkon (Earth-616)|Arkon]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 75}} and his soldiers{{r|Avengers Vol 1 76}} and the [[Split-Second Squad (Earth-616)|Split-Second Squad]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 77}} The team also battled the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]],{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 128}}, the [[Lethal Legion (Grim Reaper) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 78}} (in which Man-Ape was a member){{r|Avengers Vol 1 79}}, and the [[Zodiac Cartel (Earth-616)|Zodiac Cartel]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 80}} led by [[Cornelius van Lunt (Earth-616)|Taurus]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 81}} The battle with Zodiac continued{{r|Avengers Vol 1 82}}, and they faced the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] again this time led by Klaw.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 83}} Arkon returned.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 84}} They battled the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Squadron Supreme]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 85}}{{r|Avengers Vol 1 86}}, and [[Psyklop (Earth-616)|Psyklop]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 88}}

===Thunderbolts Gang===
Black Panther and [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] teamed up again after witnessing a crash where the driver was only a teenager. The two rushed the boy to the hospital. Black Panther explained that he was investigating the criminal activities of a local gang of African-American youths known as the [[Thunderbolts (Gang) (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], which had been recruiting members from the kids that he taught in his civilian guise of Luke Charles. The group itself was anti-establishment and was under the belief that the "white man" was the cause of their ills, and believed that violence and theft was the only way to get out from under the perception of oppression. Daredevil also learned that the boy he saved ([[Lonnie Carver (Earth-616)|Lonnie]]) had an older brother [[William Carver (Earth-616)|Billy]] who had infiltrated the group. Daredevil teamed up with Black Panther to break up the group, and with the help of Billy, they broke it up and turned them over to police. Billy then went to check on his brother at the hospital and Daredevil and Black Panther decided to treat themselves to a Coke for a job well done.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 69}}

===Doctor Doom===
When Doctor Doom, the ruler of [[Latveria]], learned of the existence of Vibranium, he searched for the small African nation with a mechanical eagle. He used a tunneling device to travel to Wakanda, but caused seismic disturbances that rattled the nation. The people called for T'Challa, who returned home to help. He found Doom trying to repair a malfunction in his device. He attacked the Latverian unaware and grabbed his weapons.{{r|Astonishing Tales Vol 1 6}} Doom called his bluff, knowing that the Panther would not shoot an unarmed man. Unfortunately for the Panther, Doom really was armed and felled him with an energy blast from his gauntlet. He then had two of his men shackle the Black Panther while he continued repairing his tunneling device. His men became worried about their leader's obsession with power. T'Challa escaped and got in front of the [[Mena Ngai|Great Mound]] of Vibranium, threatening to destroy them all by blasting the volatile substance. Now at a stalemate, Doom retreated back to Latveria.{{r|Astonishing Tales Vol 1 7}}

T'Challa was rescued by [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Ben]] and [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Johnny]] from the racist nation of [[Rudyarda]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 119}} Back with the Avengers he battled [[Kratos (Earth-616)|Kratos]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 99|100}}. He helped protect Daredevil's identity by impersonating him in front of the media.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 92}} He fought the [[Savage Land Mutates (Earth-616)|Savage Land Mutates]] and the [[Space Phantoms|Space Phantoms]], who had teamed up with the [[Eric Williams (Earth-616)|Grim Reaper]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 105|108}} They fought the [[Imus Champion (Earth-616)|Champion]] and [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 109|111}} Black Panther and the team tried to recruit Daredevil into the Avengers.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 99}}

===Lion God===
During a protest at the Avengers Mansion about T'Challa living in the US, the protesters burst in and attacked the Avengers. A news reporter demanded that T'Challa come with him and T'Challa bowed in reverence. It was revealed that the reporter was actually the [[Hathor-Sekhmet (Earth-616)|Lion God]] in disguise. He was there to bring the Panther home. In [[Africa]], T'Challa was shackled as his prisoner while he planned to destroy the Panther God. They returned to New York and the god attacked the Avengers, but [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] took him out with a lightning bolt and he vanished. He survived to plot his revenge.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 112}}

===Threats to Wakanda===
T'Challa returned to Wakanda to find his homeland threatened by [[Erik Killmonger (Earth-616)|Erik Killmonger]]. Killmonger had been ravaging villages to attract the Black Panther's attention. The two battled to the death.{{r|Jungle Action Vol 2 6}} Back in his country he battled new enemies [[Horatio Walters (Earth-616)|Venomm]], [[Baron Macabre (Earth-616)|Baron Macabre]], [[King Cadaver (Earth-616)|King Cadaver]], and [[Lord Karnaj (Earth-616)|Lord Karnaj]], all of whom eventually teamed up to fight the Panther.{{r|{{cl|Jungle Action Vol 2 7}}-[[Jungle Action Vol 2 11|11]]}}

[[Sombre (Earth-616)|Sombre]] teamed up with Killmonger.{{r|Jungle Action Vol 2 12|14}} More threats came in the form of [[Salamander K'Ruel (Earth-616)|Salamander K'Ruel]] and the return of Venomm.{{r|Jungle Action Vol 2 15|16}} The Panther finally believed he had finished with Killmonger, but even more threats arose when [[Madam Slay (Earth-616)|Madame Slay]], and then later the [[Ku Klux Klan (Earth-616)|Ku Klux Klan]], and even later the attacked [[Soul-Strangler (Earth-616)|Soul-Strangler]].{{r|{{cl|Jungle Action Vol 2 17}}-[[Jungle Action Vol 2 22|22]]}} He then faced [[Hector Ruiz (Windeagle) (Earth-616)|Wind Eagle]] using a Wakanda Flight Harness.{{r|Jungle Action Vol 2 24}} Other threats included [[Hatch-22 (Earth-77211)|Hatch-22]] and [[Zanda (Earth-616)|Princess Zanda]].{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 1 1}}-[[Black Panther Vol 1 5|5]]}} <!--[[Jakarra (Earth-616)|Jakarra]]{{r|Black Panther #6|#7}}{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 1 8}}-[[Black Panther Vol 1 #9|#9]]}}{{r|Black Panther #10}}, [[Frederick Kiber (Earth-616)|Kiber the Cruel]]{{r|Black Panther #11|#12}}{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 1 13}}-[[Black Panther Vol 1 #9|#9]]}} and Klaw returned again.{{r|Black Panther #14|#15}}

===THROB & Kristoff Vernard===
T'Challa provided sanctuary to Doctor Doom during the period in which [[Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)|Kristoff Vernard]] had usurped him on the throne of Latveria. In exchange for refuge, Doom designed the [[TransHuman ROBot (Earth-616)|TransHuman ROBot]], or THROB, to aid in guarding the sacred Vibranium mound.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 311}} However, T'Challa refused to aid Doom in retaking Latveria, as he was not interested in drawing Wakanda into Latveria's internal struggles.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 312}} When the Thing and the second Ms. Marvel, [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|Sharon Ventura]], crash-landed in Wakanda, T'Challa found them fighting THROB, and was the first person on Earth to learn that Ben's Thing form had further mutated, and Sharon had become a [[She-Thing]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 311}}

T'Challa accompanied the Fantastic Four back to New York, joined by Doom at his insistence. However, Kristoff learned of Doom's movements, and launched an attack that coincided with a parade for [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]. T'Challa, Doom, X-Factor, and the Fantastic Four teamed up to defeat Kristoff's forces. Doom then attempted, but failed, to force cooperation from the heroes in overthrowing Kristoff. Forced to prevent Doom from harming [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]], T'Challa granted Doom safe passage out of New York, but that would be the last courtesy he would extend to Doom.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 312}}

===Vibranium Shield===
When Steve Rogers was forced to step down from his role as Captain America by the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities (Earth-616)|Commission on Superhuman Activities]] when he wouldn't go along with their orders, he needed a replacement for his [[Captain America's Shield|shield]]. After returning an [[Adamantium]] shield created by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] due to Rogers' conflict with Stark over the [[Armor Wars I|Armor Wars]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 228}}{{r|Captain America Vol 1 341}} T'Challa provided a Vibranium shield to Rogers. Although he could not be there in person for the delivery, he sent his regards via satellite.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 342}} The shield would later be given to [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|John Walker]] when Rogers resumed the role of Captain America and Walker became [[US Agent]].{{r|Captain America Vol 1 354}}

===Rescuing Ramonda & Joining the Pendragons===
Wakanda almost went to war with [[Atlantis]] during an incident on [[Kiber Island]] and T'Challa found out that his stepmother had not left his family, but was kidnapped and made into a domestic slave by [[Anton Pretorius (Earth-616)|Anton Pretorius]], a known white supremacist who sexually assaulted her daily.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 13|37}} It was soon after her discovery that T'Challa rescued her and joined the [[Knights of Pendragon (Earth-616)|Knights of Pendragon]], where he learned that he had a Pendragon Spirit within himself.{{r|Knights of Pendragon Vol 1 14|18}}

With the help of [[Black Axe (Earth-616)|Black Axe]] and [[Khairi Ngala (Earth-616)|Afrikaa]], he exposed the efforts of [[Cardinal Technologies (Earth-616)|Cardinal Technologies]] to escalate the civil war in [[Mohannda]].{{r|Black Axe Vol 1 5|7}}

===The Threats of Achebe & Nakia===
Empowered by the demon [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]], [[Achebe (Earth-616)|Reverend Achebe]] led a coup on Wakanda backed by [[Xcon (Earth-616)|Xcon]], an alliance of rogue intelligence agents and the Russian mafia. In exchange for Mephisto's abandoning Achebe and leaving Wakanda in peace, T'Challa sold his soul to him, knowing that his unity with the Panther God and its link to the spirits of past Panther Clan leaders would ruin Mephisto’s plans. Demanding sanctions against America over the Xcon coup, T’Challa linked the United States to it and presented evidence to the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]].{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 3 1}}-[[Black Panther Vol 3 9|9]]}}

During his conflict with Mephisto, however, T'Challa was tricked into kissing [[Nakia Shauku (Earth-616)|Nakia]] of the Dora Milaje.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 3}} This caused an obsessive love for T'Challa to grow within Nakia, and she eventually attempted to kill Monica Lynne. T'Challa ejected her from the Dora Milaje as a consequence.{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 3 11}}-[[Black Panther Vol 3 12|12]]}} Distraught and alone, Nakia was captured, tortured and almost killed by Achebe before Killmonger rebuilt her into Malice.{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 3 23}}-[[Black Panther Vol 3 25|25]]}}

===Losing the Panther Title===
Killmonger also attempted to wipe out Wakanda's economy, so T'Challa was forced to nationalize all foreign companies. This resulted in Tony Stark having controlling interest in the Wakandan Design Group.
[[File:Black Panther Vol 4 1 Textless.jpg|The King of Wakanda|200px|thumb|left]]
After the economy was once again stabilized, T'Challa fought Killmonger in ritual combat and was almost killed, but lost the Black Panther title instead of his life. [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]] and [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Brother Voodoo]] mystically nursed T'Challa back to health.{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 3 20}}-[[Black Panther Vol 3 22|22]]}}

Killmonger was unable to process the heart-shaped herb when he took it, and fell into a coma. T'Challa therefore reluctantly reclaimed the title of Black Panther by default only.{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 3 24}}-[[Black Panther Vol 3 25|25]]}}

===Future Black Panther===
On a mission to recover [[King Solomon's Frogs]], T'Challa met a [[T'Challa (Earth-1145)|future version of himself]] who was telepathic and fatally sick. Attempting to change this future, he broke up with Monica Lynne and kept his future body in cryostasis.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 #35|48}}

===The Black Dragon===
The criminal [[Tilda Johnson (Earth-616)|Nightshade]] resurrected the fabled Chinese monster Chiantang the [[Chiantang (Earth-616)|Black Dragon]] to use against T'Challa back in New York. Black Dragon had a mind-controlled [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]] attack Black Panther. Panther managed to defeat Iron Fist, however the assault caused the fatal sickness the future Panther had originally predicted. Nightshade, meanwhile, managed to revive the future Panther.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 38|40}}

===Downfall of Xcon===
At the same time, the White Wolf took over Xcon and killed most of its leaders. The previous Xcon leadership had used King Solomon's Frogs to replace the U.S. President and Canadian Prime Minister with brainwashed future counterparts, allowing the company to overthrow both countries. Hunter continued with this plan and exacted revenge on Tony Stark for his buy-out of Wakandan Design Group. Afraid for Tony, T'Challa sent him a message by using financial finagling to seize control of [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Enterprises]] and simultaneously annex a small Canadian island in [[Lake Superior]]. This  prompted the U.S. and Canadian leaders to meet to discuss this crisis. The coordination of these leaders allowed Panther and his allies, including the future Panther, to invade the [[White House]] and foil Xcon's plot, thereby un-brainwashing the duplicate leaders and returning them to their own times.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 41|45}}

===Death of the Future Panther===
As the Panther returned to Wakanda, the future Panther fell into a coma and was placed back into stasis until he was killed by Man-Ape. Man-Ape had then been freed by Divine Justice in hopes of freeing her tribe. After all of this, the original T'Challa became unstable and constantly hallucinating due to the aneurysm inflicted on him by Iron Fist. He attacked the Jabari tribe with the intent of wiping them out; but almost accidentally killed Divine Justice. This caused him to come to his senses and stop the battle. Unable to face almost killing a woman he loved, the Panther went into hiding in New York and handed over Wakanda to his council.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 48|49}}

===Renewed Strength===
A policeman named [[Kevin Cole (Earth-616)|Kasper Cole]] adopted an abandoned Panther costume and sought out T'Challa for training and guidance. This incident gave T'Challa the strength to fight for his health, his nation and his world.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 #50|56}}{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 59}}{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 61|62}}

===Avengers Disassembled===
At the same time, T'Challa went back to the Avengers, who battled [[Scorpio (Brotherhood of the Ankh) (Earth-616)|Scorpio]], and unmasked U.S. Defense Secretary Dell Rusk as the evil [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]].{{r|Avengers Vol 3 66|70}} The team was disbanded not longer after when the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] had a mental breakdown.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 84|85}}{{r|Avengers Vol 1 500|503}}

===Invasion of Wakanda===
The [[United States Government (Earth-616)|US Government]] believed that Wakanda was destabilised, and when neighboring [[Niganda]] attempted an invasion, they sent in their zombie [[Very Special Forces (Earth-616)|Very Special Forces]] to 'help' Wakanda. T'Challa had returned and was able to take down the [[Nigandan Army (Earth-616)|Nigandan Army]] and the supervillains they hired, before telling the United States to leave his country.{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 4 4}}-[[Black Panther Vol 4 6|6]]}}

After the fall of [[M'Butu (Earth-616)|M'Butu]], [[Erich Paine (Earth-616)|Erich Paine]]'s facility released mutant animals, fruit of his experiments, and T'Challa took action against it. As he had knocked out Paine and was looking for a way to nullify his mimicking powers, the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] came and refused to listen to T'Challa while he was ordering them to back off in order to avoid their powers to be mimicked. During this adventure, T'Challa also tried to reconnect with his former lover Ororo.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 175|176}}{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 4 8}}-[[Black Panther Vol 4 9|9]]}}

===Marriage===
[[File:Black Panther Vol 4 18 Wraparound Textless.jpg|Black Panther and Storm's Wedding day|250px|thumb|right]]
T'Challa helped reunite Ororo with her surviving family members in Africa, as well as introducing her to her long lost grandparents in America. Not shortly after, T'Challa proposed to Ororo.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 14|17}} The two were soon married in a large Wakandan ceremony and then headed off on a diplomatic world tour for their honeymoon.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 18}}

===World Tour/Civil War===
They visited nations like Latveria, the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], and Atlantis as well as America{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 4 19}}-[[Black Panther Vol 4 22|22]]}}. There, the nation was gripped by the events of the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], and while visiting the [[White House]], the authorities attempted to force Ororo to sign on to the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] despite her status as a ruling dignitary. This resulted in the royal couple choosing to side with Captain America and the [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] in the war.{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 4 22}}-[[Black Panther Vol 4 25|25]]}}

===Joining the Fantastic Four===
At the conclusion of the superhero Civil War the [[Wakandan Embassy (New York City)|Wakandan Embassy]] in New York was destroyed, leaving T'Challa without a home while in the city. At the same time Reed and [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Sue Richards]] decided to “take a break” from the Fantastic Four, leaving an opening on the team. T'Challa and Ororo accepted the Richards' offer to stay in the Baxter Building and, along with the Thing and the Human Torch formed a new Fantastic Four.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 26}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 544}}

During their time with the team, they encountered [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] and defeated his [[Heralds of Galactus (Earth-616)|heralds]] [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] and [[Lambda-Zero (Earth-616)|Stardust]],{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 544|546}} traveled to alternate realities,{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 27|30}} fought a new [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]],{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 547|549}} and saved [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]] from dying with the help of [[Greg Willis (Earth-616)|Gravity]] and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 550}} They also stayed and fought alongside the entire Fantastic Four against the Hulk and his [[Warbound (Earth-616)|Warbound]]. Though they fought hard, they were eventually defeated along with many others.{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 2}}{{r|{{cl|World War Hulk Vol 1 4}}-[[World War Hulk Vol 1 5|5]]}}

===Back To Wakanda and the Skrull Invasion===
Upon returning to Wakanda, Black Panther and Storm faced a returned [[Erik Killmonger (Earth-616)|Killmonger]], defeating him with assistance from Monica Rambeau (a.k.a. [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Pulsar]]). Afterward, Black Panther and Wakanda were faced with the invasion off the alien shapeshifters the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]], who had already infiltrated as part of their "[[Secret Invasion]]" plan to conquer Earth. However, Panther had found out about the intruders and managed to capture all of the Skrull imposters beforehand. A fact the Skrull general learned upon entering Wakanda when he seen the heads of his Skrull soldiers on posts and a sign that read "See Wakanda and Die". Panther had studied their composition and weaknesses which later aided him in taking down a [[Super-Skrulls (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]] who possessed [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]]'s skin, with [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s claws, Iron Fist's "Chi fist" moves, [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]]'s aim, and the combined fighting styles of Captain America, Moon Knight, [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]], Daredevil, [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]], and Black Panther. T'Challa used his gained knowledge of Skrull joints, pressure points, and body composition to disable and tear apart the Super Skrull with ease. Then going on, with the aid of his wife Storm, to outwit and defeat the Skrull general and his army by posing as Skrull soldiers themselves to get close to and kill the general.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 35|41}}

===Shuri, the New Black Panther===
Sometime after, [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Prince Namor]] the Sub-Mariner, attempted to recruit T'Challa for the [[Cabal (Dark Illuminati) (Earth-616)|Cabal]], a secret council of master super-villains. Attacked by the forces of fellow Cabal member Doctor Doom, T'Challa was left comatose. His sister [[Shuri (Earth-616)|Shuri]] was trained as the next Panther, with the mantle passing onto her officially after T'Challa awakened from his coma and attempted to recover from his injuries.{{Citation}}

===Doomwar===
After he was tricked and ambushed by Doom and the passing of the Panther mantle, T'Challa lost all of his enhanced attributes given to him by being the panther totem. As a result, he had been working with his sorcerer, [[Zawavari (Earth-616)|Zawavari]], to accumulate a replacement. He had since made a pact with another unknown Panther deity, returning his attributes to an even higher level as well as placing incantations on his body, making him highly resistant to most magic and mystical assaults. This had all been done in preparation for the imminent battle with Doctor Doom, which culminated in Doom's defeat and T'Challa rendering all of the processed Vibranium inert to give his people a chance to rebuild without their dependence on the element.{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 5 6}}-[[Black Panther Vol 5 12|12]]}}{{r|{{cl|Doomwar Vol 1 1}}-[[Doomwar Vol 1 6|6]]}}

===Man Without Fear===
With his former powers now gone, and questioning his original role as the protector of his people, T'Challa accepted an offer from Matt Murdock to take over the guardianship of [[Hell's Kitchen]] in the aftermath of the recent gang wars as Matt left New York, both men needing to re-learn who they were and of what they were capable. Using forged immigration papers provided by [[Franklin Nelson (Earth-616)|Foggy Nelson]], T'Challa established a new identity as Mr. Okonkwo, native of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], purchasing a small diner in order to be close to the people he now protected.{{r|Black Panther: The Man Without Fear Vol 1 513}} Storm, although missing her husband, recognized his need to operate on his own, and agreed to leave him in private unless he asked for her. T'Challa found himself facing the new super criminal [[Vladimir Dinu (Earth-616)|Vlad the Impaler]], who was consolidating power in the city's underworld. He also faced foes such as Kraven the Hunter when a doctor attempted to provoke a conflict between T'Challa and Kraven when T'Challa discovered the doctor's illegal medical experiments to recreate the electricity-wielding powers of a dead foe, but with Storm's help, T'Challa was able to convince Kraven that the doctor had lied about being able to kill him and get his help releasing the mutated animals back into the wild{{r|Black Panther: The Man Without Fear Vol 1 520}}. Later, John Glenn, the new Hate Monger (possessed by the spirit of the original), created the nationalist vigilante the American Panther as a complicated revenged scheme{{r|Black Panther: The Man Without Fear Vol 1 521}}, before T'Challa was able to banish the Hate Monger's spirit from Glenn{{r|Black Panther: The Man Without Fear Vol 1 523}}. Also, after the [[Stark Tower]] was rebuilt, he re-joined the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 1}}

===King of The Dead===
[[File:T'Challa (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Vol 1 608 0001.jpg|thumb|left|King of the Dead]]
T'Challa finished his duty in Hell's Kitchen and returned home to Wakanda. Sometime after, attacks from a city below Wakanda called [[Necropolis]] began constantly happening by undead soldiers. T'Challa called Reed Richards to help him think through the situation as he was the only person T'Challa believed could "keep up" intellectually. Reed Richards and T'Challa stepped into the dark underground city Necropolis, the City of the Dead, where all Black Panthers are laid to rest.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 607}} They eventually met Bastet, the Panther God, and T'Challa told her that he desired to be Black Panther again but doesn't want to harm Shuri in any way. Meanwhile, Shuri, Susan Richards and Storm took a herb to make them "see the gods", and immediately took the battle to [[Anubis (Earth-616)|Anubis]], the God of the Dead who was the source of the soldiers. They encountered and engaged Anubis and its army. Bast showed T'Challa a vision of Wakanda being flooded and told him that the catastrophic destruction of Wakanda is but a prelude to something worse, and for the salvation of his nation, he must become her king and not Wakanda's. She deemed him "King of the Dead". He gained the power and knowledge of all the past Black Panthers to become "A king of kings. Bast's champion. Bast's Black Panther". He now ruled over Necropolis while Shuri remained in power in Wakanda.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 608}}

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
T'Challa sided with the Avengers in the conflict against the X-Men and fought his wife in battle.{{r|{{cl|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 2}}-[[Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 4|4]]}} After the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] chose its [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|five hosts]] and they began to make the world a better place, T'Challa provided a hideout for the, now, outlaw Avengers in Wakanda, although he started to doubt the Avengers as they continued to struggle against them.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 7}} After Namor attacked and almost destroyed Wakanda searching for the Avengers, T'Challa named the X-Men enemies of his country. Because Ororo was still queen at the time, many felt that she betrayed both her new kingdom and her subjects. By not only siding with the X-Men against Wakanda, but by attacking T'Challa, and throwing her wedding ring away for all to see. Which was then followed by Ororo leaving her confused subjects and the crumbled city that she was the queen of when she left Wakanda with the X-Men. So as a result, the High Priest of Wakanda annulled their marriage, while Wakanda began the process of being rebuilt.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 9}}{{r|AVX: Vs Vol 1 5}}

===Joining the Illuminati===
While performing a test for potential members of Wakanda's space program, T'Challa witnessed the event known as an "[[Glossary:Incursion|Incursion]]", when two universes collide with their Earths as the point of collision. T'Challa faced the [[Yabbat Ummon Turru (Earth-1365)|Black Swan]], who destroyed the other Earth colliding with Earth-616. T'Challa managed to capture her, and decided to reconsider his refusal to associate with the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]], contacting them in order to get their help in solving the issue.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 1}} Before their first meeting, T'Challa vowed to fellow Illuminati member Namor that after the situation was settled, he would personally kill him.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 2}}

[[File:T'Challa (Earth-616) vs. Black Swan from New Avengers Vol 3 1.png|thumb|174px|Black Panther stops Black Swan]]The Illuminati and Black Panther went on to face several Incursions, often avoiding them narrowly by outside aid, until they were finally forced to destroy another planet Earth (albeit an empty one) during an Incursion taking place in Latveria.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 6}} Meanwhile however, hostilities between Wakanda and Atlantis increased, with several incidents leading closer to all out war. In light of the dire situation the Illuminati were facing, Namor made an offer for peace with generous terms and told T'Challa to support accepting that peace in his council meetings, since he would only make the offer once. Despite T'Challa's attempts, his sister discarded the peace offer and ordered the armies of Wakanda to make ready for war.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 7}} The Wakandan armies destroyed the city of Atlantis in a sneak attack.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 8}}

===Infinity===
While the Avengers were off-world representing Earth in a coalition of space empires in the war against the invading [[Builders (Race)|Builders]], the Mad Titan Thanos and his armies of space pirates invaded the Earth to kill Thanos' last remaining offspring. Wakanda was one of many sites targeted and a wing of Thanos' army led by [[Black Dwarf (Earth-616)|Black Dwarf]]  of the [[Black Order (Earth-616)|Black Order]] attacked. Black Panther engaged Black Dwarf in battle, and narrowly managed to outlast him as Wakanda's armies repelled the invaders.

Meanwhile, Prince Namor bent the knee and swore his and Atlantis' allegiance to [[Proxima Midnight (Earth-616)|Proxima Midnight]], one of Thanos' lieutenants, in an attempt to exact revenge against Wakanda for the destruction of Atlantis. He did so by telling her that the [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Gems]] were located in Wakanda, leading Proxima to lead the majority of Thanos' forces in another invasion of the city.{{r|{{cl|New Avengers Vol 3 9}}-[[New Avengers Vol 3 10|10]]}}

Meanwhile, T'Challa and the rest of the Illuminati were faced with yet another incursion. Upon arriving at the site, they were greeted by an [[Alephs|Aleph]] from the other Earth, which asked them to come with him. They were brought before the Builders of that reality, who told them that they were planning to destroy every Earth in the [[Multiverse]] in order to prevent the early death of everything. After asking them if they had the means to destroy their own world, they asked what they were waiting for, before returning them home and destroying the Earth of their reality.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 11}}

Meanwhile, Thanos' armies breached the Golden City and Thanos himself explored the Necropolis, uncovering the Illuminati's cache of world-destroying weapons and their prisoners.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 5}} Thanos departed after finding [[Thane (Earth-616)|his son]], allowing the Illuminati to reclaim the Necropolis from Thanos' soldiers. After easily dispatching of the Avengers, Thanos himself was encased in an amber construct by his son, along with his lieutenant Proxima Midnight, in a state of "living death."{{r|Infinity Vol 1 6}}

Upon returning to the Necropolis, T'Challa was betrayed by his Dora Milaje who revealed to Shuri that T'Challa had been conspiring with Namor. After refusing to tell her anything due to his unwillingness to reveal the Illuminati's secrets, Shuri forbade T'Challa from ever entering Wakanda, restricting him to the Necropolis.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 12}}

===Incursion of Earth-4290001===
During an incursion between [[Earth-616]] and [[Earth-4290001]], the Black Panther and the Illuminati were forced to consider either destroying the incursive world and kill its many innocent people or allow it and their world to collide just to save face. Panther tries to work up the nerve to press the detonator to the [[Antimatter Injection System|bomb]] that would destroy Earth-4290001. The ghost of his father T'Chaka appears to him and demands that he act. It was the job of the Black Panthers to protect the kingdom of Wakanda in life. In the end, however, T'Challa couldn't go through with it. Enraged, T'Chaka strips his son of his kingdom, of his people, and of his post as King of the Dead. As far as T'Chaka is concerned, he has no son. Eventually, only Namor was able to work up the nerve to destroy Earth-4290001.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 21}}

In anger, T'Challa attacks Namor who confesses that it was he who sent Thanos and the Black Order to Wakanda. T'Challa would have killed Namor on the spot if the rest of the Illuminati hadn't restrained him. As Namor is kicked out the Illuminati, T'Challa swears to kill him.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 22}}

===[[Time Runs Out]]===
When Captain America ordered the Avengers to take down the Illuminati, the Black Panther along with the Illuminati went into hiding.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 24}}{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}} Because of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s improvement on ways to track them down, the Illuminati had to periodically move from base to base.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 25}}

Eight months into the future, T'Challa's kingdom Wakanda was destroyed by Namor and his [[Cabal (Namor's) (Earth-616)|Cabal]]{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 24}}, which he created from the Illuminati's prisoners in the Necropolis to destroy incursive worlds since the Illuminati would no longer perform the task,{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 23}} and now used the Necropolis as their base. T'Challa and Shuri led a strike team in an attempt to penetrate the Necropolis and retrieve the Cabal's supply of antimatter injectors. However, they got caught in a booby trap by [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]], a member of the Cabal. Proxima Midnight emerged and began slaughtering the Wakandan soldiers. Shuri volunteered to stay behind to hold off Proxima while T'Challa fleed and relinquished her rulership over to him.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 24}}

The Illuminati devised a plan to get rid of Namor's Cabal.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 40}} They let themselves be found by Steve Rogers' Avengers, and set a trap to subdue them with the help of [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|Sunspot's Avengers]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 39}} Even though the help of the Invisible Woman was needed to make this possible, as Rogers' Avengers had brought their own reinforcements,{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 28}} the Illuminati were able to share their plan with Steve.

Namor, who had become disgusted with the Cabal's needless slaughtering of the people of worlds they could destroy painlessly, was ready to turn himself in, but also set a trap to destroy the Cabal. For this next Incursion, the incursive world had been ravaged by the [[Sidera Maris (Multiverse)|Sidera Maris]]. Namor would lead the Cabal to said world, activate the antimatter injector without their knowledge, and leave them to die with said Earth. The Cabal would be prevented from escaping with the use of an A.I.M. platform capable of creating an impenetrable barrier between the two colliding Earths. However, as Namor had left the incursive Earth and prepared to activate the platform, Black Panther finally got his revenge. Black Panther stuns Namor with a knife while Black Bolt uses his sonic scream to throw Namor off the platform to the soon-to-be-destroyed Earth in order to make him personally pay for his crimes. As the antimatter injector began to destroy the Earth, Panther and Black Bolt returned to theirs, informing the Avengers that not only the Cabal had been destroyed, but Namor was also not going to come back.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 40}}

===Secret Wars===
During the final incursion, Black Panther was one of the heroes that tried to stop [[Earth-1610]] from destroying his Earth. After the vessel transporting the Earth's "resurrection team" was destroyed by the Children, Mr. Fantastic and Black Panther was forced to put the "lifeboat" in action. As the "lifeboat" was deployed, [[Eden Fesi (Earth-616)|Manifold]] teleported numerous heroes into it including [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]], [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], and Thor, which allowed them to survive the end of the [[Multiverse]].{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 1}}

Black Panther and the other heroes in the life raft would later be awakened by Doctor Strange eight years after the end of the Multiverse and the creation of [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]], a planet cobbled together from the fragments of destroyed realities ruled by Doom.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 3}}

Black Panther and the other heroes were later transported by Strange to confront the Cabal after a distress call was sent to him by one member of the [[Thor Corps (Earth-15513)|Thor Corps]], and after this Doom himself appeared to quell the fighting. When Doom tried to kill them, Doctor Strange teleported them across Battleworld, but at the cost of his own life.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 4}} Black Panther ended up in the domain of [[Egyptia]] along with Namor.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 5}}

Three weeks later, while Battleworld was in disarray, T'Challa, with Namor, arrived to Strange's Hidden [[Isle of Agamotto]], using the Key of Agamotto given to them by Strange, they entered, and after identifying themselves as member of the Illuminati to a projection of the deceased Sorcerer Supreme, they were given access to some powerful items Strange had collected over the years, including the [[Siege Courageous]] and an [[Infinity Gauntlet]] that worked only in [[Doomstadt]].{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 6}} Black Panther and Namor next traveled to the [[Deadlands (Battleworld)|Deadlands]] for reinforcements, and Black Panther used his title as the King of the Dead to convince the zombies to join the forces opposing Doom.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 7}} Using the Siege Courageous, the two of them arrived to the battlefield along with the zombies, proclaiming that Doom's reign was over.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 8}}

Doom tried to convince T'Challa that he would rebuild Wakanda if he would stop fighting, but he refused the offer and struck Doom down. Victor quickly regenerated from the attack and directed an energy blast at Black Panther and Namor, which killed the latter, but T'Challa continued fighting and two of them used their power against each other. Their battle ended when Doom crushed the Infinity Gauntlet and subdued T'Challa, but it was revealed to be a distraction, and Doom teleports to the [[Owen Reece (Earth-616)|Molecule Man]]'s location.

When the Molecule Man transferred his power to Mister Fantastic, Battleworld exploded. As the inhabitants of Battleworld were trying to run from their ultimate demise, Black Panther gripped tightly to the [[Reality Stone|Reality Gem]] and was transported to his reborn native universe in the rebuilt Wakanda.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 9}}

===A Nation Under Our Feet===
T'Challa's regime was challenged by the consecutive emergence of two insurgent groups, the [[People (Earth-616)|People]], led by [[Tetu (Earth-616)|Tetu]], and the rebellious Dora Milaje, led by [[Aneka (Earth-616)|Aneka]] and [[Ayo (Earth-616)|Ayo]]. Influenced by the anti-monarchical teachings of the elder [[Changamire (Earth-616)|Changamire]], the People intended to overthrow T'Challa, and had no qualms with resorting to violent and depraved methods, which included bombing public areas, one of these attacks which almost cost the life of Ramonda. With the help of the [[Crew (Earth-616)|Crew]], Black Panther dwindled the numbers of the People, and exposed their alliance with nefarious villains such as [[Ezekiel Stane (Earth-616)|Zeke Stane]]. T'Challa later enlisted the help of Changamire himself to speak against those who justified bloodshed with his teachings, conceding that Wakanda's form of ruling needed to change, and accepting that if Wakandans were the most advanced people in the world, the institutions that govern them should be as well.

[[File:Black Panther Vol 6 7 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
The Dora Milaje, on the other hand, were motivated by the belief that T'Challa neglected his people, and held the position that no one man should hold as much power as he did. Ayo and Aneka initially acted as vigilantes, liberating the Wakandans exploited by criminals. They later settled in the [[Jabari Village|Jabari-Lands]], taking them from the [[White Gorilla Cult (Earth-616)|White Gorilla Cult]], and offered asylum to hundreds of people in need. With the assistance of Shuri, whom T'Challa retrieved from a transcendent plane where her soul had been left wandering after being felled by the Black Order, the Dora Milaje were temporarily appeased.

The remaining forces of the People were finally subdued when they marched towards the Golden City, and Tetu was captured. Once the dust settled, T'Challa held hearings for the Dora Milaje, who had receded to simply desiring independence for their lands, but eventually accepted to remain under Wakanda's rule. T'Challa set out to establish a council to create a constitution that could lead to a democratic government. Even though Wakanda was to be ruled by the people, T'Challa would remain as the king who represented the nation, but didn't rule it.{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 6 1}}-[[Black Panther Vol 6 12|#12]]}} Since T'Challa had asked Storm's help when he reformed the Crew,{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 6}} their reunion opened the doors to a reconciliation and the reignition of their romance.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 13}}

===[[Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda (Storyline)|The Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda]]===
One day, T'Challa was contacted by the [[Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda]]'s [[N'Jadaka (Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda) (Earth-616)|Emperor]] who supposedly sought to establish an union. After T'Challa passed the empire's test, he and Manifold were then tricked and captured by the empire, since the emperor feared that once the Black Panther discovered the Empire's true nature, he would join the rebel group, the [[Maroons (Earth-616)|Maroons]], to take down the empire so he had T'Challa's memories wiped and was conscripted into the Empire's slave group, the [[Nameless (Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda) (Earth-616)|Nameless]].{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 18}} Thankfully, T'Challa had retained his memories of his love, Storm, which allowed him to fight back against his slavers, and was eventually broken out by the Maroons.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 1}} He joined the Maroons and went on a mission to retrieve the [[M'kraan Crystal|Shard of M'Kraan]] from the empire.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 2}} However, while training and trying to retrieve his memories with fellow Maroon, [[Nakia Cabral (Earth-616)|Nakia]], the Maroons were discovered and then attacked by the empire's [[Askari (Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda) (Earth-616)|Askari fighters]], along with a brainwashed Manifold. They were able to escape, however, with many Maroon casualties.{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 7 3}}-[[Black Panther Vol 7 4|4]]}} 

After T'Challa was convinced by Nakia and a record of the late [[N'Yami (Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda) (Earth-616)|Captain N'Yami]] to keep fighting,{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 5}} the Maroons were able to capture the empire's chief technologist, [[Kofi (Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda) (Earth-616)|Kofi]], in order get the information they needed.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 7}} After freeing some of the slaves,{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 8}} the rebels went to [[Agwé]] in order to free the planet from the empire, and were also successful in retrieving Manifold and the emperor's daughter, [[Zenzi (Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda) (Earth-616)|Zenzi]], who was possessed by the goddess Bast.{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 7 9}}-[[Black Panther Vol 7 10|10]]}} After Bast and a [[Jengu]] restored T'Challa's memories,{{r|{{cl|Black Panther Vol 7 11}}-[[Black Panther Vol 7 12|12]]}} the Maroons began going to the original Wakanda, while T'Challa discussed with [[M'Baku (Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda) (Earth-616)|Captain M'Baku]] whether he was a good king or not, with M'Baku wanting T'Challa to be the king Wakanda needed.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 13}} However, they were then attacked by Emperor N'Jadaka and his army who came to retrieve his daughter, leaving the [[Teku-Maza]] to set off and blow their planet as a last ditch effort to eliminate N'Jadaka.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 14}} After returning to Wakanda and reuniting with his loved ones,{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 15}} the Askari fighters assaulted Wakanda, revealing that N'Jadaka was still alive via [[Character Index/Unnamed Symbiotes#N'Jadaka's Symbiote|his symbiote]].{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 16}} They tried to prevent N'Jadaka to resurrect himself through the body of Erik Killmonger,{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 17}} however, they were unsuccessful in stopping them.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 19}} This left T'Challa to go to Djalia in order for the spirits to restore the memories of the Nameless.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 20}} He fought the spirits of his ancestors, while they reminded him of his failures from the past and questioning him why they should recognize him as king. After T'Challa made amend with his failures he declared himself as their king, and the spirits restored the memories of the empire's slaves resulting with the Askari betraying the empire.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 22}}
