===Origin===
[[File:Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 8 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
The Supreme Intelligence, also known as the Supremor, was created more than a million years ago by the extraterrestrial race known as the [[Kree]] to help them create a Cosmic Cube like the [[Shaper of Worlds (Earth-616)|Shaper of Worlds]] that their enemies, the Skrulls, had once created. It is composed of the brains of the greatest Kree minds (thinkers, generals, philosophers, scientists and so on), removed upon their deaths and assimilated by the super-computer in a process called "Supremorization."{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 41}}

Eventually the Intelligence developed a mind of its own and refused to create the cube knowing the dangers that could be wrought by an evolved Cosmic Cube, which was what had destroyed massive parts of the Skrull Empire.{{r|Captain America Annual Vol 1 7}}

Despite this, it was allowed to continue to exist to serve the Kree with its wisdom. Its influence eventually grew to the point where it replaced the Kree government, although it has occasionally been deposed for periods of time. Most of the Kree are fanatically devoted to it, and its worship is an organized religion.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 5}}

===Evolutionary Plans===
The Supremor realized long ago that the Kree had reached an evolutionary dead-end. Its main concern became to find a way to jump-start its race's evolution. The Kree experimented on a multitude of races hoping to find a way to evolve themselves and turn these experiments, the [[Inhumans]], into bio-weapons against the Skrulls. However, when downloading the data about the experiments the Supremor saw a prophecy about the [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Midnight King]] rising from the experiments who would bring the end to the Supremor. The Intelligence then ordered the execution of the experiments and the scientists behind them, but because of the data was left uncompleted five of the experimented races evaded genocide.{{r|FF Vol 1 6}}

The Intelligence then formulated a new plan to jump-start their evolution. Its manipulations of the human [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] and the Kree hero [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Mar-Vell]] were part of this process, especially since it was aware of the evolutionary potential of the human race, especially the [[Destiny Force]], which it helped awaken in Rick Jones.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 #89}}{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 #41}}

It orchestrated events so that Jones and Mar-Vell had to share the power of the "[[Nega-Bands]]" and then, as the Supremor, challenged them in battle at the same time, intending to defeat them in time for their minds being ravaged by the Millennia Bloom, leaving them mindless soldiers which the intelligence would then have use to destroy Earth, so that no Earth human could ever arise with power matching its own, and absorb Jones's potential. These plans it had for Jones and Mar-Vell were foiled when Jones activated the Intelligence's ship's weapons systems to cause a solar flare from Hala. The Intelligence was forced to divert all of its energy into the planetary shields, leaving it and all of the Kree powerless and unconscious.{{r|Captain Marvel #46}}

===Second Kree/Skrull War===
After the Supreme Intelligence realized that all of the Skrulls lost their ability to shapeshift following the detonation of the [[Hyperwave Bomb]], it plotted a new campaign for a second war between the Kree and the Skrull.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 6}} It also acquired the [[Soul Stone|Soul Gem]] which it used to balance the blue and pink Kree components within itself and also used it to absorb [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]]'s soul.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 6}} However, the Surfer escaped and managed to remove the Soul Gem from the Supreme Intelligence causing the being's sanity to shatter,{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 8}} and leaving [[Nenora (Earth-616)|Nenora]] to lead the Kree Empire. The war finally ended when Nenora was exposed as Skrull spy.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 13}}

The [[Tath Ki (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Contemplator]] began restructuring the Supreme Intelligence's scrambled consciousness who was then taken over by the Elder's mind.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 29|30}} Luckily, a [[Cotati]] wizard liberated the Supreme Intelligence, but manipulated the being into appointing [[Clumsy Foulup (Earth-616)|Clumsy Foulup]] as the leader of the Kree.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 31}} However, it later regained its post as the supreme leader after absorbing the minds of [[Ael-Dan (Earth-616)|Ael-Dan]] and [[Dar-Benn (Earth-616)|Dar-Benn]].{{r|Captain America Vol 1 398}}

===Kree/Shi'ar War===
During [[Operation Galactic Storm]] the Supremor secretly arranged to have a "Nega-Bomb," a device producing a special kind of radiation gathered from the Negative Zone, detonated in the Kree Galaxy, hoping its energies would reactivate the Kree's genetic potential. In the process, thousands of millions of Kree were killed. This led a group of [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] to decide to execute it for genocide, against the wishes of the rest of the team. However, although the Avengers believed they had killed it, only its host computer was destroyed because the Supremor had secretly beamed itself to an awaiting starship hidden from the conflict between the Kree and [[Shi'ar]].{{r|Avengers #347}}{{r|Quicksilver Vol 1 10}}

The Kree Empire had fallen after the Kree-Shi'ar War, with the Kree Empire placed under the rule of the Shi'ar Imperium, ruled by [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]]. The Kree Star Force were her enforcers, now turned into a branch of the Imperial Guard. The Supremor android on the Star Force acted as the Supreme Intelligence's spy into the workings of the remaining Kree Empire.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 347}}

===Manhattan===
Despite having survived, the Supreme Intelligence found itself in a reduced state. Needing a massive amount of energy in order to re-incorporate itself, the Supremor manipulated several beings to achieve its ends. The Supremor influenced [[Primus (Kree) (Earth-616)|Primus]], a Pink Kree from a prison-world, into bringing a "nega-reactor" from Hala to Earth while guiding [[M-Nell (Earth-616)|Commando]], a Blue Kree named M-Nell, to join the Shi'ar Imperial Guard and to be part of a subsequent mission to Earth. While keeping its identity a secret, the Supremor then spoke to [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] in a dream and tempted him with the promise that he would soon have an opportunity to gain the power that would make him the first of Earth's new wave of heroes. When its three pawns all came together in the sewers beneath Manhattan, Commando and the Imperial Guard prevented Primus from spreading Nega-energy across Earth while an empowered Jones was able to absorb that energy. The Supremor then drained that energy from Jones to complete its resurgence.{{r|Imperial Guard #1|3}}

===Live Kree or Die!===
The Supreme Intelligence was later found beneath the surface of Earth by [[Galen-Kor (Earth-616)|Galen Kor]] and his followers who brought it with them to the [[Blue Area of the Moon]]{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 7}} which they had rebuilt using the Skrull technology hidden there.{{r|Quicksilver Vol 1 10}} Now calling themselves the [[Lunatic Legion (Kree Survivors) (Earth-616)|Lunatic Legion]], these Kree were fanatically committed to seeking vengeance against the people of Earth for (as they believed) detonating the "Nega-Bomb" in the Kree galaxy and planned to convert much of the human population into beings genetically identical to pure-bred Kree (Neo-Kree). Although the Supremor needed these Kree, their plan was incompatible with its own plans for Earth so it secretly took steps to prevent the strike against Earth from succeeding. Its first attempt was to mentally control a Skrull named Sn'Tlo, later known as the [[Sn'Tlo (Earth-616)|Sensational Hydra]], into taking actions that created an atmosphere of xenophobia on Earth but Galen Kor and his men were able to overcome that setback. When Quicksilver and some allies teleported to the Blue Area in search of a kidnapped Carol Danvers, they encountered the Supreme Intelligence who helped them by revealing what the Lunatic Legion were planning to do, thereby giving them the information they need to destroy the power source for the weapon. Finally, after the Avengers had mistakenly come to believe that the Kree threat had been thwarted, the Supremor secretly sent a message from the Moon that revealed that the Lunatic Legion were about to launch their attack, warning the Avengers in time for them to prevent the strike. In the aftermath, the Supreme Intelligence was content to remain in the Blue Area where a new facility jointly controlled by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and Starcore was constructed to study the Blue Area and monitor it.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 7}}

===Avengers: Forever===
The Supreme Intelligence remained in the Blue Area and allied with both [[Gustav Brandt (Earth-616)|Libra]] and [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]] against the plans of [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus (Nathaniel Richards)]] and the [[Time-Keepers]]{{r|Avengers: Forever Vol 1}}. The resulting "Destiny War" involved Rick Jones and seven Avengers pulled from other times, and by the time it ended the Supreme Intelligence had secretly obtained the [[Forever Crystal]], an artifact with powerful time-manipulation abilities.{{r|Avengers: Forever Vol 1 12}}

===Maximum Security===
Although seemingly still confined to the Blue Area, the Supreme Intelligence was able to secretly use the Forever Crystal to advance the evolution of a number of its loyal Kree subjects.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 35}} Calling themselves the Ruul, these evolved Kree posed as a new merchant race from beyond charted space and sought to join the [[Galactic Council (Earth-616)|Galactic Council]] at the same time as [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego the Living Planet]] was wreaking havoc. Following the Supremor's plan, the Ruul suggested that the problem of humanity might be contained if Earth were to be transformed into a prison planet where all the civilized worlds could send their criminals, and the galactic council agreed to this plan.{{r|Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet Vol 1 1}}

During the resulting chaos on Earth, the Supreme intelligence was visited on the Moon by [[Moonstone (Karla Sofen)|Moonstone (Karla Sofen)]] who sought information about a Kree woman named [[Ajes'ha (Earth-616)|Ajes'ha]] who had previously carried her moonstone.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 44|45}}

Eventually, the Avengers discovered the truth behind Maximum Security and were able to reveal it to the assembled Galactic Council. However, the delegates refused to believe them until the Supreme Intelligence chose to reveal itself to them in order to boast of how it and the Ruul had fooled and manipulated them, and then revealed that the Kree were well on their way to taking back their interstellar empire. No longer needing to pretend to be imprisoned on the Moon, the Supreme Intelligence returned to Hala.{{r|Maximum Security Vol 1 3}}

===Return to the Kree Empire===
Back on the Ruul homeworld of Hala, the Intelligence got its wish for more genetic stock for the Kree, when some of the Inhuman tribes reunited with the regrowing Kree Empire. Combined with the Ruul and the mutated Kree, the Kree Empire would soon rise again after throwing off the shackles of the Shi'ar Empire.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 3|4}}

===Annihilation===
After the universe was destroyed and recreated by [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Genis-Vell]] and [[Entropy (Earth-616)|Entropy]], son of [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]], the Kree race was restored to its original form. It was declared that the Supreme Intelligence was not in command of the Kree Empire, having been replaced by the merchant [[House of Fiyero (Earth-616)|House of Fiyero]].{{r|Annihilation #2}} House Fiyero, in fact, placed the Supreme Intelligence in a state of "living death" and ruled the Kree without its consent. [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan]] The Accuser was told by the being's caretakers that it longed for Ronan to return and set the Kree on the correct path against the [[Annihilation Wave (Earth-616)|Annihilation Wave]]. Realizing that there was nothing to be done to restore the creature to life, Ronan instead shattered the tank and left it to die rather than live in pain, after deposing House Fiyero for their treachery.{{r|Annihilation Vol 1 5}}

===Annihilation: Conquest===
Nonetheless, the spirit of the Supreme Intelligence lived on. With the [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]] slowly assimilating the Kree Imperium world by world, it had to act. It telepathically called to [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-616)|Phyla-Vell]], the most recent Quasar, urging her to seek out the "savior" of the Kree. The savior proved to be [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]], though his awakening was premature.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest #1|4}}

On Hala, the Phalanx tried to resurrect the Supreme Intelligence's body. This sent a mental echo through space that would assimilate all Kree. [[Zak-Del (Earth-616)|Wraith]] foiled this plan by using his [[Exolon]] weapon to assimilate the Supremor's soul.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith Vol 1 4}}

With the killing of the Supremor, the Kree Empire would fall under the stewardship of Ronan and eventually the rulership of the Royal Family of Inhumans, who would lead the Kree into a [[War of Kings|war]] with the Shi'ar and their mad emperor, [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]].{{citation}}

===War of Four Cities===
The Intelligence was resuscitated using a seed hidden within Ronan's universal weapon staff and two rogue alternate dimension Reed Richards. It then proceeded to order the extermination of Earth for its link to [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] and the [[Universal Inhumans (Earth-616)|Universal Inhumans]].{{r|FF Vol 1 11}}

===AvX===
When the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] headed towards the [[Earth]], the Supreme Intelligence informed the interdimensional Kree hybrid [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Noh-Varr]] about it and ordered him to help his Avengers teammates intercept the entity. However, he also informed him that he must contain it at all costs, even if it meant eliminating his teammates.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 25}} The Supremor was psychically controlled to act as a mouthpiece by [[Minister Marvel (Earth-616)|Minister Marvel]], nephew of Captain Mar-Vell and a devotee of the Phoenix Force.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 27}}

===Infinity===
During the [[Builders (Race)|Builders]]'s crusade of conquest on their way to attack the Earth, the Supreme Intelligence was initially helpful with the Galactic Council's efforts to halt their march. However, once the Kree homeworld was taken over by the Builders, the Intelligence commanded its people to surrender. After Ronan and his Accuser corps fractured away to continue the battle, the Supremor gave them blanket amnesty upon the success of the campaign.{{r|Infinity Vol 1 6}}

===Destruction of Hala and the Supremor===
With the resurgence of the [[Black Vortex]], a powerful item capable of unleashing the cosmic potential of whoever used it, the Kree attempted to destroy it. The Supreme Intelligence sent Ronan and the Accuser Corps to take it from their current possessors, the cosmically-enhanced [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]], [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]].{{r|All-New X-Men #38}}

In retaliation, the three cosmically-enhanced beings assaulted [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]].{{r|All-New X-Men #39}} The Accuser Corps tried to fight off their attackers, but were notably overpowered. After being denied permission by the Supreme Intelligence to use the power of the Black Vortex to fight back, Ronan The Accuser disobeyed him and submitted to its power, ensuring a successful defense for the Kree homeworld and forcing Gamora, the Beast, and the Angel to flee after the latter was knocked down.{{r|Guardians Team-Up #3}}

Once the dust settled, the Kree attempted to get rid of the Black Vortex once more. However, they were attacked by [[J'son (Earth-616)|Mister Knife]] and the [[Slaughter Lords (Earth-616)|Slaughter Lords]], another party interested in the Vortex. Taking advantage of the state of frailty in which Hala was left, he used all the firepower of his flying fortress to destroy the planet. The Supreme Intelligence demanded its Accuser Corps to escape, while it itself remained in Hala and was destroyed.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 25}}

When an expedition to Hala led by [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Marvel Boy]] and composed of numerous members of the Inhuman Royal Family reached its destination, Marvel Boy planted the seed of the [[We-Plex Supreme Intelligence System (Earth-200080)|We-Plex Supreme Intelligence System]] from his native universe in the Supremor's remains. The resulting process ended in the resurrection of the Plex Intelligence, with the absorbed material from the other Supreme Intelligence.{{r|Royals Vol 1 5}}

===Vox Supreme===
[[File:Vox Supreme (Earth-616) from Captain Marvel Vol 10 14 001.jpg|thumb|Merged with Vox]]
As the [[Kree Civil War]] raged on, a member of the [[Kree Imperium]]'s [[Vox (Super-Inhumans) (Earth-616)|Vox]] of [[Super-Inhumans]], was able to find the fragments of the original Supreme Intelligence, and merged with them, reviving the old Supreme Intelligence and becoming [[Vox Supreme (Earth-616)|Vox Supreme]]. Together they planned to collect the genetic material of powerful beings to create a new master race, which would worship them as gods.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 15}} They forced [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] to kill her fellow Avengers and bring their corpses to them so they could harvest their DNA, otherwise they would explode the Kree refugee camps on Earth. However, Carol outsmarted them as she had handed braindead clones of her teammates, while hiding the real Avengers inside [[Singularity (Multiverse)|Singularity]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 13}} Despite this, Vox had what they needed and incapacitated Carol in order to harness her powers. Carol then used a device build by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] to free herself and fought Vox, resulting in her being fused with the DNA of the Avengers which allowed her to finally defeat Vox Supreme, before returning to normal. Afterwards Vox Supreme was sent to the [[Raft]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 16}}

| Powers                  = Despite being basically immobile, the Intelligence possesses all known psionic powers, such as telepathy, telekinesis, cosmic awareness, sensory link, postcognition, precognition etc.

The Supremor is also capable of manipulating energy and matter, as well as create up to three android servitors that act as its eyes and ears when away from itself. These androids, called Supremor also, possess some degree of independence when created, but are totally loyal to the Supremor.

It usually projects images of itself across space, cyberspace and even into the astral planes, in the form of a huge, amorphous, greenish, humanoid face, with tentacle-like "hair," to communicate with its agents scattered across the cosmos. It has even assumed the form of an orange-dragon with a green-skinned octopus as its head, called the Multitude.

Its power was only further enhanced when it later merged with an inert Cosmic Cube, which now serves as its true housing, kept in a separate room from the organic computer façade it created to fool would-be assassins. Upon assuming its new housing, the Supremor was now able to control reality within a limited distance of itself, as well as able to open up portals between dimensions, most notably the Astral Plane and the dimension of Death.
