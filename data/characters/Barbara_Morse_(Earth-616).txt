===Early life===
'''Dr. Barbara "Bobbi" Morse''' was born and raised in [[San Diego]], [[California (State)|California]]. She excelled in school and later attended the [[Georgia]] Institute of Technology, specializing in biology, earning a PhD under [[Wilma Calvin (Earth-616)|Dr. Wilma Calvin]].{{r|Hawkeye #2}}{{r|Astonishing Tales #12}}

===S.H.I.E.L.D.===
She joined Dr. Calvin in working on [[Project Gladiator (Earth-616)|Project: Gladiator]]. The project was backed by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who wanted to recreate the [[Super Soldier Serum]] that created [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. During the course of the project, S.H.I.E.L.D. trained Bobbi to be a spy, and she was given the codename Agent 19.{{r|Hawkeye #2}}{{r|Astonishing Tales #18}}

[[File:Barbara Morse (Earth-616) from Ka-Zar Vol 2 3 001.jpg|thumb|left|Agent-19]]
The team for Project Gladiator consisted of [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Dr. Ted Sallis]] and [[Paul Allen (Earth-616)|Dr. Paul Allen]], whom she was ordered to start a relationship with.{{r|Astonishing Tales #13}} Dr. Allen and [[Ellen Brandt (Earth-616)|Ellen Brandt]] were revealed to be working for [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]]. They sabotaged the project, transforming Sallis into the Man-Thing.{{r|Astonishing Tales #12}}

She traveled to the [[Savage Land]] with Dr. Paul Allen in search of [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]].{{r|Astonishing Tales #6|7}} However their plane crashed, with Paul being saved by Ka-Zar and Barbara being rescued by the British of [[New Britannia (Earth-616)|New Britannia]].{{r|Astonishing Tales #8|10}} It was revealed her engagement on with Paul was a sham on  S.H.I.E.L.D. orders due to her suspicion that he was involved with A.I.M.{{r|Astonishing Tales #11}} In [[Florida (State)|Florida]], Allen was destroyed by Man-Thing, who was once Barbara's colleague, Dr. Theodore Sallis.{{r|{{cl|Astonishing Tales Vol 1 12}}-[[Astonishing Tales Vol 1 13|13]]}} With Ka-Zar, she traveled to [[New York City|New York]]{{r|Astonishing Tales #15|16}} and helped defeat [[Victor Conrad (Earth-616)|Victorius]], who had taken a sample of Super Soldier Serum from Sallis and Calvin's experiments.{{r|Astonishing Tales #17|18}} After they defeated Victorius, Ka-Zar and [[Zabu (Earth-616)|Zabu]] returned but not before Ka-Zar and Bobbi shared a farewell kiss.{{r|Astonishing Tales #19|20}} She later visited the Savage Land again to help on his many adventures,{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 2 #3|4}} but ultimately returned home to the [[United States of America|United States]].{{r|{{cl|Ka-Zar Vol 2 5}}-[[Ka-Zar Vol 2 8|8]]}}

===Huntress===
Bobbi was later recruited by a US Senator to investigate corruption in a Latin American branch of S.H.I.E.L.D. She dropped out of S.H.I.E.L.D. and became the costumed operative, Huntress. But when the threat was defeated she returned back to her S.H.I.E.L.D. duties.{{r|Marvel Super Action #1}}

===Mockingbird===
[[File:Mockingbird.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Bobbi as Mockingbird]]
Barbara's penchant for taunting her opponents in battle earned her the code name of "Mockingbird". She was sent on a mission by [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] to stop [[Carl Delandan (Earth-616)|Carl Delandan]]; on the way she teamed up with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]. During this mission, a misunderstanding caused some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to shoot at her, and she spent some time in a coma.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #95}} Afterwards, she decided to fake the death of her civilian identity in order to keep her family safe.{{r|Hawkeye & Mockingbird #2}} She was one of the many heroes recruited in the [[Contest of Champions]].{{r|Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions #1}}

===Cross Technological Enterprises===
Morse was a freelance agent when she met [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Clint Barton]], a.k.a Hawkeye. At the time, he was serving as chief of security for [[Cross Technological Enterprises (Earth-616)|Cross Technological Enterprises]].{{r|Hawkeye #1}} During this time, they were kidnapped by [[William Cross (Earth-616)|Crossfire]], who wanted to use hypnotic ultrasounds to force superheroes to kill each other.{{r|{{cl|Hawkeye Vol 1 2}}-[[Hawkeye Vol 1 3|12]]}}

Hawkeye and Mockingbird defeated Crossfire, but Hawkeye suffered hearing damage due to the villain's ultrasound technology. Hawkeye and Mockingbird eloped a few days later.{{r|Hawkeye #4}} 

===West Coast Avengers===
Now married, they returned to join the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] as a couple.{{r|Avengers #239}}{{r|Captain America #292}}{{r|Fantastic Four #265}} The [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], then Avengers chairman, appointed him to head a [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|new branch]] of the team based on the West Coast.{{r|Avengers #242|243}} Hawkeye chose Bobbi as one of his team members, along with [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]], and [[Greer Nelson (Earth-616)|Tigra]].{{r|Avengers #244|245}} Clint and Bobbi served as the motivating force behind the team.{{r|Avengers #246}}

The team moved to the new [[Avengers Compound]].{{r|West Coast Avengers #1}} They battled villains such as [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Goliath]],{{r|Iron Man Annual #7}} [[Blank (Clyde) (Earth-616)|Blank]],{{r|West Coast Avengers #2}} [[Franklin Hall (Earth-616)|Graviton]],{{r|West Coast Avengers #3}} [[Maelstrom (Earth-616)|Maelstrom]],{{r|Avengers #250}} [[Quasi-Motivational Destruct Organism (Earth-616)|Quasimodo]],{{r|Avengers #253}} [[Douglas Birely (Earth-616)|Doctor Demonicus]],{{r|Iron Man #193|194}}{{r|Iron Man #195|196}} the Vision when he went rogue,{{r|Avengers #254}} and the [[Dire Wraiths]].{{r|Rom #65|66}}

===Lost in the Past===
One of the western team's most fateful adventures had [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]] scatter them across time. They encountered an Old West vigilante gang consisting of the [[Lincoln Slade (Earth-616)|Phantom Rider]], [[Matthew Hawk (Earth-616)|Two-Gun Kid]], and [[Jonathan Clay (Earth-616)|Rawhide Kid]], and joined with them to fight a large criminal outfit headed by the evil [[Don Hertz (Earth-616)|Iron Mask]].{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 18}} The Phantom Rider came to believe that Mockingbird was a goddess, and since he was one with the spirits, that she should be his mate. After they had vanquished Iron Mask's gang, the WCA decided to try going back to the time of Kang's reformed self, the [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Pharaoh Rama-Tut]], in order to try and get themselves home. Just before leaving, the Rider kidnapped Mockingbird and rode away.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 19}}

With the rest of the WCA in ancient [[Egypt]], Mockingbird was given an Indian love potion and temporarily forgot her old life and fell in love with the Phantom Rider, who revealed his secret identity as Lincoln Slade. However, Two-Gun and Rawhide were on his trail, determined to recover Barbara. They found the two, but Mockingbird, under the influence of the potion, fought them alongside Lincoln, and she and the Rider escaped.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 20}}

However, as time passed Mockingbird began to slowly fall out of the influence of the potion, and when Two-Gun showed up in a makeshift Hawkeye outfit to jog her memory, she finally broke free from Lincoln's influence. She implied that Lincoln had raped her — having had intercourse with her while she was drugged — and rode off to kill the Phantom Rider. Two-Gun and Rawhide were alarmed, knowing the good the Rider had once done and not wishing to kill him, only to see him brought to justice. Mockingbird told them the fight was hers alone, and Two-Gun reluctantly held Rawhide back from following her.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #21|22}} 

Mockingbird confronted the Phantom Rider on a mountain peak he held sacred and in the fight that followed, Lincoln Slade fell from a cliff. He managed to grip the edge of the cliff with his fingers, but in the slickness of the rain that was coming down at the time, he was losing his grip. Mockingbird stood and watched him fall, doing nothing to save him. There was some justice in this, but it also broke the Avengers' code of no killing.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 23}}

===Back to the Present===
Eventually, Hawkeye returned to bring Mockingbird back to the present with the rest of the WCA, as the local Indians buried Lincoln in a cave tomb. Meanwhile, the spirit of Lincoln Slade continued to torment Bobbi in the present day. Lincoln Slade's great-great-grandson [[Hamilton Slade (Earth-616)|Hamilton]] had discovered his ancestor's tomb and become a modern-day Phantom Rider. Lincoln's spirit possessed him, and while doing some good in the world (founding the [[Rangers (Earth-616)|Rangers]] for instance), this new Phantom Rider began to haunt Mockingbird in revenge.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 31}} Sometime after the first attack, Bobbi tracked down Hamilton Slade (who was unpossessed at the time), assaulting and nearly killing him before being stopped by Moon Knight.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 32}}

Later, as part of his revenge, the Phantom Rider told Clint a version of the events of his death, and Bobbi and Clint argued over the acceptability of Avengers taking a life. This argument led to the couple separating. Along with Tigra and [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]] (who had joined after helping the rest of the team in Egypt), Bobbi left the team.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #34|37}} They briefly formed a more proactive splinter group, thwarting the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] (with aid from [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Bill Foster]]) and battling the [[Night Shift (Earth-616)|Night Shift]].

Bobbi's break off team found Hamilton Slade, who again had no memory of his exploits while possessed. Realizing Hamilton too was a victim, Bobbi sought out [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Hellstorm]] to help her exorcize him. Upon performing the ceremony, the onlookers were shocked to see two spirits rise from Hamilton — that of Lincoln, as expected, but also that of [[Carter Slade (Earth-616)|Carter Slade]], his great-great-uncle, the original Phantom Rider, whom Lincoln had taken over for when the former met an untimely death.

Carter's spirit had recognized the madness that afflicted Lincoln even in death and was battling Lincoln's spirit for dominance within Hamilton as he knew that possessing poor Hamilton and leaving him with no memory of events was wrong. Carter's spirit eventually subdued Lincoln's and when Daimon Hellstrom was prepared to banish Lincoln's spirit forever Carter agreed to go with him, to forever ending his brother's menace. However, knowing that Carter's spirit was a force for good and did not deserve banishment, Hamilton Slade, at the exact moment of banishment, willed Carter's spirit to enter his body, transforming him again into the Phantom Rider. After this, Mockingbird parted ways with her fellow ex-WCAers, with Tigra returning to active duty and Moon Knight returning to New York. Mockingbird remained an Avenger, but only in reserve capacity.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 41}}

The rift between Bobbi and Hawkeye grew when Mockingbird proved instrumental in a plot by several world governments to abduct and dismantle the Vision for his near-takeover of the world, giving them access to the Avengers Compound. Bobbi initially believed the plot was only a "contingency plan", only to learn it was being put into action, with additional steps like a false Ultron and incapacitating the Scarlet Witch that put her friends' lives at risk. Bobbi tried to stop the plot and was imprisoned for a time, only escaping to warn the Avengers after it was too late to save the Vision.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #42|43}}

===Great Lakes Avengers===
Hearing that a Midwestern-based team was using the name "[[Great Lakes Avengers (Earth-616)|Great Lakes Avengers]]", Hawkeye took Mockingbird along with him to investigate. After determining that these "impostors" had no malicious intent, Clint and Bobbi took it upon themselves to train this neophyte crime fighting team.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 46}}

In the wake of the Avengers receiving a [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] charter, both active teams were revamped. Bobbi received only one vote to become an active member. Hawkeye had left the GLA earlier to return to the AWC, and Bobbi assumed he was one who voted for her. Clint rejected the idea, asking why he would ever vote to have his ex-wife hanging around.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #69}} Bobbi later found out it was [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|USAgent]] who cast a vote for her, mostly to bug Hawkeye.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #81}}

===Operation Galactic Storm===
After [[Operation Galactic Storm]] (during which Bobbi was part of the team of reservists who remained on Earth), the West Coast team and Vision encountered [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]] once again. This time, he was accompanied by his latest "mate", [[Alkhema (Earth-616)|Alkhema]], whose brain patterns had been based on Mockingbird's. Alkhema, however, turned on Ultron, and the Avengers won the day. Clint, who had recently re-assumed his Goliath identity, seemingly managed to reconcile with his estranged wife at this time.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #87|92}}

===Skrull Imposter===
In fact, a [[Skrulls|Skrull]] kidnapped Bobbi and replaced her with a sleeper agent called [[H'rpra (Earth-616)|H'rpra]] prior to Bobbi and Clint's reconciliation. She went through the [[Skrull Infiltration Ritual]] which gave her all of Bobbi's memories and abilities. She served with the team for some time. But H'rpra/Bobbi was captured by [[Satannish (Earth-616)|Satannish the Supreme]], the AWC embarked upon what would be their last mission. The team battled the combined forces of Satannish and [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]]. During their escape, "Bobbi" was killed by Mephisto.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #100}} Shortly thereafter, the Vision disbanded the West Coast team.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #102}}

===Return and New Avengers membership===
Another [[Barbara Morse (Retro, Skrull) (Earth-616)|Skrull]] was among a [[Savage Land Skrulls (Earth-616)|group]] who believed themselves to be the people they were impersonating, and who crash landed in the [[Savage Land]], only to eventually be killed by Clint Barton.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 1|5}}

[[File:New Avengers The Reunion Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|300xp|left|Clint & Bobbi]]
After the climactic battle between the Skrulls and Earth's heroes during the [[Secret Invasion]], the individuals replaced by Skrull agents were revealed to be alive and well, including Bobbi. She was apparently one of the first people captured and replaced.{{r|Secret Invasion #8}}{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #19}} The returned Mockingbird then joined her estranged husband and his teammates in the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers #48}}

Bobbi formed her private spy organization, the [[World Counterterrorism Agency (Earth-616)|World Counterterrorism Agency]], or WCA. She was joined on one of her first missions by her husband, Clint Barton, as Ronin, and they reconciled over the Phantom Rider issue once and for all.{{r|New Avengers: The Reunion #4}}

After [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] was replaced by Steve Rogers, the Avengers teams were reorganized and Bobbi joined [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]]'s team.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 1}} 

[[File:New Avengers The Reunion Vol 1 1 Textless Second Printing.jpg|thumb|right|Hawkeye & Mockingbird]]
She and Clint separated after a particularly intense WCA mission involving a new [[Jaime Slade (Earth-616)|Phantom Rider]]. Jaime Slade became possessed by her great-great-great granduncle, Lincoln, after an encounter with the heroes.{{r|Hawkeye & Mockingbird #1|2}}

When in pursuit of criminals, the two had nearly wrecked the vehicle Jaime was riding in, damaging parts of the artifacts she'd discovered with her father, one of which was the urn holding Lincoln's ashes.{{r|Hawkeye & Mockingbird #3}} That night, Lincoln's spirit visited both Mockingbird and Jaime, giving Jamie powers and compelling her to seek out another foe of Mockingbird and Hawkeye, Crossfire.{{r|Hawkeye & Mockingbird #5}}

During a confrontation with [[Deidre Wentworth (Earth-616)|Superia]], she was grievously injured. To save her life Clint had Nick Fury inject her with a formula that was a functional combination of the [[Infinity Formula]] and the [[Super Soldier Serum]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 13}}

===Secret Avengers===
Mockingbird joined S.H.I.E.L.D.'s own [[Secret Avengers (S.H.I.E.L.D.) (Earth-616)|Avengers]] team.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 #2|3}} During a mission to assassinate the [[Andrew Forson (Earth-616)|Scientist Supreme]] of A.I.M., Bobbi was left on [[Barbuda|A.I.M. Island]]{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 4}}{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 6}} with no memory of how she got there, and had to impersonate an A.I.M. agent during her involuntary stay for months.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 #7|8}} She was discovered, and brainwashed into siding with A.I.M., being one of her first actions the near-murder of her fellow teammate [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]].{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 #12|13}} Bobbi managed to break from the control and was rescued by her fellow teammates. During a fight against [[Yelena Belova (Earth-616)|Yelena Belova]], Mockingbird used her holo-camouflage on her in order to disguise her as Mockingbird and have her shot by A.I.M. instead of her.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 #14|15}} She was, however, found and confronted by Andrew Forson. Bobbi fought and defeated him, and left to live under the radar along with [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Daisy Johnson]] and [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky Barnes]].{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 16}}

Bobbi teamed up with [[Melinda May (Earth-616)|Agent Melinda May]] and together battled against a band of super-powered monstrosities created by [[Lucien Geist (Earth-616)|Dr. Lucien Geist]].{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 8}}

===Back at S.H.I.E.L.D. with Lance Hunter===
Bobbi was later assigned by [[Nicholas Fury, Jr. (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] to be the official S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison to [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 1}} who at the time; were developing new tech for S.H.I.E.L.D. Here, she helped Spider-Man take down [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mister Negative's]] operation in Shanghai,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 8}} disband [[Zodiac (Jacobs') (Earth-616)|Zodiac]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 11}} and destroy [[Goblin Army (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn's Goblin Army]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 28}}

[[File:Barbara Morse (Earth-616) and Lancelot Hunter (Earth-616) from Mockingbird S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary Vol 1 1 001.png|thumb|left|200px|Hunter wakes up after Bobbi calls him 'Clint']]
Around the same time, she also became a S.H.I.E.L.D. handler to [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Silk]], who was working undercover to infiltrate [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat's]] gang in exchange for S.H.I.E.L.D. looking for information on Cindy's missing parents.{{r|Silk Vol 2 1}} However, the information was scarce and slow coming during Cindy's investigation, but was still successful to leading Cindy to her parents trapped in the Negative Zone dimension.{{r|Silk Vol 2 12}} After Silk rescued her parents, Bobbi put up the Moon family in one of her safe houses.{{r|Silk Vol 2 13}}

Sometime later, she got romantically involved with [[Lance Hunter (Earth-616)|Lance Hunter]] and their relationship was going quite well, in spite of the fact that Bobbi (by mistake, Freudian slip, or just for teasing him) often called him "Clint".{{r|Mockingbird: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary #1}}

===Secret Empire and Aftermath===
After [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] and the [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|reality warped Steve Rogers]] took over the United States,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} Mockingbird joined the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]] to resist Hydra's rule and joined a team tasked with retrieving the remnants of the sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]] to restore the original Steve Rogers.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 2}} After returning to the Underground's hideout [[Mount|The Mount]] with the rest of the team, Mockingbird let an unidentified person know that the trip only resulted in the recovery of two shards. At first, it was implied to be Hydra,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 5}} but when confronted about her communication, Mockingbird revealed that she was actually talking with [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] in secret. Hill was planning a major attack against Hydra, and Mockingbird was trying to convince her to hold off her attack until the Underground retrieved more Cosmic Cube shards.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 6}}

[[File:Peter Parker (Earth-616) and Barbra Morse (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 789.jpg|thumb|right|Sharing their first "real" kiss]]
Whith Hydra's rule over the United States ended and SHIELD dissolved, Bobbi later began a relationship with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 789}} and was sharing her apartment with him as he recovered from the fall of his company. Using her superhero and SHIELD background, she took a job at [[Humanitech Robotics Inc. (Earth-616)|Humanitech Robotics Inc.]] as their security expert. She was initially suspicious, but with Spider-Man's help, found out that their "A.I" was actually [[Quicksand (Nguyet) (Earth-616)|Quicksand]] imprisoned inside the robots and mind controlled to be their A.I.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 791}} Bobbi and Peter broke up when they realized they didn't have much in common.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 795}}

===Genius In action Research Labs (G.I.R.L.)===
After meeting [[Nadia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Nadia Van Dyne]], Bobbi joined Nadia's [[Genius In action Research Labs (Earth-616)|Genius In action Research Labs]] project as a mentor to the young scientists involved in the lab.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 8}}
