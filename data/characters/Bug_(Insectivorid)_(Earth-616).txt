===Early Life===
'''Bug''' was a master thief from the [[Insectivorids|Insectivorid]] homeworld [[Kaliklak]] based in the [[Microverse]]. Bug was a jokester and rogue by nature but always a professional when it came down to the job. He and [[Acroyear (Earth-616)|Acroyear]] shared a unique friendship as the two were diametrical in personality. Bug's friendship with Acroyear may have been responsible for Acroyear's decision to question the sometimes overly cold warrior ethic that ruled his people.

Bug and Acroyear, along with other political prisoners, who were against [[Baron Karza (Earth-616)|Baron Karza]], were herded into the Yard of the Gladiators. There they were told they must practice for the gladiatorial games. Maccabee, a large humanoid, attacked Acroyear, but they are able to beat him. A Shadow Priest appeared, ostensibly to give final absolution to those who would perish in the games. He gave Acroyear his energy blade and Bug his rocket-lance. The guards take the prisoners into the arena.

In the arena, Bug killed a repto with his rocket-lance, and Acroyear threw a huge terraphant into the stands. Karza gave the thumbs down sign. A hornetdroid grabbed Acroyear; Bug blinded it with his lance, and Acroyear killed it. Tradition now demanded that they be freed, but Karza ordered them held over for the next day's games. [[Mari (Earth-616)|Mari]] gave Bug a thumbs up sign, which he took to mean that she belonged to the underground.{{r|Micronauts Annual Vol 1 1}}

===Micronauts===
They later met a lost traveler called [[Arcturus Rann (Earth-616)|Arcturus Rann]], who rescued them from the other prisoners. They told Rann that the warp drive was invented during his trip and that Karza used it to conquer the other worlds of the Microverse.

Bug, Rann and Acroyear were herded into a colosseum, where [[Microtron (Earth-616)|Microtron]] and Marionette were performing. Bug told Rann that Marionette was a princess who had joined the underground and that an escape was in the works. The doors closed, but Marionette was kept inside. A deathtank entered and began firing its pulse-cannons into the captives. Acroyear told Rann that he was an x-factor and must be protected. Bug vaulted onto the tank and threw a packet bomb through its eye slits, while Acroyear assaulted its wheels. Rann, Bug, and Acroyear found Marionette already in a getaway vehicle. They escaped aboard a ship piloted by [[Biotron (Earth-616)|Biotron]] and took their ship through the Fringes of the Microverse.{{r|Micronauts Vol 1 1}}

The HMS Endeavor travelled to [[Earth]], and when the crew exited the ship they found themselves in the backyard of a typical American home. To the Microns everything was gigantic in comparison to them. They were attacked by a puppy, which Biotron punched. The next menace appeared, a huge growling machine (a lawn mower) that rolled over Acroyear and Bug. Acroyear grabbed the blades, stopped it, and toppled the thing. The operator, surprised, fell as well. He was even more surprised to find six small aliens in his backyard. The boy helped the team as they were attacked by two battleships which had arrived, commanded by [[Shaitan (Microverse) (Earth-616)|Shaitan]]. He swatted the ship into a tree, where it exploded. Acroyear launched a divot into a scout pod, knocked it into another pod, and both wrecked. The other scout pod chased Rann and Marionette. Bug's rocket lance bumped it off course enough to hit a chain on the swing set, but Bug was caught in the resulting explosion.{{r|Micronauts Vol 1 2}} Whilst the ship was chased by Shaitan, Bug recovered at the Coffin house. Bug figured the wreckage of Shaitan's other cruiser was his ticket home, but Ray Coffin had it in a shoe-box on his desk.{{r|Micronauts Vol 1 3}} Bug hitched a ride, with Ray Coffin, who took the debris to the Human Engineering Life Laboratories (HELL) at [[Cape Canaveral]] and met a former astronaut, [[Phillip Prometheus (Earth-616)|Phillip Prometheus]]. Bug hoped to get enough parts to assemble a fighter and go home.{{r|Micronauts Vol 1 4}}

Thee Microns used their Astro Station to follow Bug to Cape Canaveral. Inside the lab, Bug watched as Phillip took Ray on a tour. To their amazement, he had other specimens from the Microverse. Because he collected them before the Spacewall was breached, they did not survive the trip. When Steve identified them, Prometheus shook him, desperate for more information. He explained that, during his last trip to Starlab, cosmic rays bombarded the space station and killed the rest of the crew. The medical systems he designed, though, replaced his damaged organs with bionic parts; he pulled off part of his face to show that much of his body was now metal and circuitry. He needed the technology of the Microverse to improve his systems, and he would do anything to get it. Ray realized that Steve was in grave danger, and when a guard restrained him, Prometheus warned him that all the guards were robots of his own creation. Bug dropped from the ceiling and attacked.

Muffin and Marionette found Steve in the lab. Prometheus tilted the floor so that they and Bug started sliding into his Prometheus Pit, his portal to the Microverse. Acroyear arrived and tore up the robot holding Ray, while Microtron extended his arm to catch Steve. Freed, Ray grappled with Prometheus, and they toppled into the pit. The robots turned on the others.{{r|Micronauts Vol 1 5}} Steve Coffin and the Microns fled Prometheus's lab with robots in hot pursuit. Bug, not the best choice for pilot, crashed into the bed of the pickup truck, just before it crashed through the gate. They headed for Ray's fishing cabin in the [[Florida (State)|Florida]], [[Everglades]].{{r|Micronauts Vol 1 6}}

Whilst hiding in the Everglades they came into contact with the [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]], scared they attacked him. The rest joined the attack, with no noticeable effect. Bug, pinned by Man-Thing's hand, panicked and started to cook in his shell because "whosoever knows fear, burns at the Man-Thing's touch". Muffin's bark called Steve's attention to the swamp buggy moored at the dock. His fear replaced by determination, Steve jumped into the buggy and started the engine. Man-Thing released Bug to investigate this new emotion, courage. It plodded forward directly into the swamp buggy's giant fan.{{r|Micronauts Vol 1 7}}

Bug and the Microns reached HELL, where they found a pitched battle in progress. Steve told the head of security, Colonel Macey, that their foe was Baron Karza from the Microverse. A force field surrounded the building, and Karza controlled Prometheus's robots as well as Prometheus's body. Bug, and the crew of the Endeavor attacked the robots, but a blast from Karza brought them down. A glow rose from the Prometheus Pit. [[Raymond Coffin (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]] burst forth and drove Karza into the ground. They quickly flew back to the Microverse through the Pit and sealed it, thus stranding Karza on Earth. Karza realized his danger, abandoned Prometheus's body, and followed the Endeavor into the Pit. Time Travelers sealed the breach in the Spacewall.{{r|Micronauts Vol 1 8}}

The Endeavor returned to the Microverse, only to find itself surrounded by the Acroyear fleet. They landed and stepped out of the ship to face a daunting array of arms and armor, but Acroyear iwa welcomed by his people. Baron Karza also returned to the Microverse. The Microns made plans with the Acroyears help.{{r|Micronauts Vol 1 9}}

Karza, captured Rann, and the Mircons came to the rescue. Bug jumped off Microtron's fighter to attack a Phobos; his rocket-lance ignited its fuel pods and he was caught in the explosion. Microtron heard him yell and fled to the surface of [[Spartak]].{{r|Micronauts Vol 1 10}}

The team mourned Bug, who disappeared after the explosion. But he was still alive as the [[Time Travelers (Earth-616)|Time Traveler]] followed Bug through hyperspace. Once Bug, still unconscious, returned to normal space, he fell through a forest canopy and landed on [[Kaliklak]], his own world.{{r|Micronauts #12}}

===Return Home===
Bug awoke in a forest, and when he climbed a tree and spotted the Central Nest, he was glad to be home. But he remembered his homeworld was still under the control of Baron Karza's colonial administration. He ambushed the driver of a snail lorry to get some information and found that the driver was his mentor, a master thief. He also found that [[Wartstaff (Earth-616)|Wartstaff]], his father, now ran his old gang at the Lair.

Bug ambushed the guard at the Lair and strolled inside. He saw Wartstaff at a banquet with his own gang and with [[Jasmine (Earth-616)|Jasmine]]'s, who had formed an uneasy alliance with them. Wartstaff fired a pulse-blast; Bug dodged and upended the table. Wartstaff, he now learned, told the gang that Bug sold them out to the colonial administration, when in fact Wartstaff sold Bug out, which eventually landed him in Karza's Pleasure Pits. Wartstaff seemingly wanted to welcome his son home, but held a knife behind his back. Jasmine warned Bug about the knife, then cut off Wartstaff's antennae to humiliate him. Bug announced that he was taking over. When one of the cutthroats objected, Bug pierced his chest with a rocket-lance. Bug, Jasmine, and the gang watched the Colonial Air Terminus for several weeks. When Jasmine asked why, Bug told her that they were going to overthrow the colonial administration.{{r|Micronauts #13}}

Bug's forces took heavy fire from the anti-aircraft batteries on the Central Nest. Wartstaff swept out of the sky to attack the biggest battery. Drawing a bead on himself. He split his cruiser into its component pods, but was too late as he took a direct hit. By providing a diversion, however, he had given the others the chance to disable it. That heroic deed turned the tide, and the rebels soon penetrated the halls of the Nest itself. Bug and Co. found the governor surrounded by his bodyguards, whom they quickly overwhelm. He remembered how this human had him beaten before shipping him off to Karza's gladiator pits on Homeworld, and blasted him with his rocket-lance. The soldiers surrendered, thinking that the "liberation forces" had arrived. Only then did Bug learn that Karza died weeks ago. Kaliklak was free.{{r|Micronauts #14}}

===Fantastic Four===
The HMS Endeavor was attacked by a swarm of antrons, however they fought them off, but it was revealed they worked for the [[Psycho-Man (Earth-616)|Psycho Man]] who travelled to investigate what the waste-disposal system on his ship aka the antrons had found.{{r|Micronauts #15}}

An "anti gravitational flux tube" drew the Microns to a worldship, where they confronted Psycho-Man. He responded by using his Psychotron, causing Bug to believe a repto, natural predator of insectivorids, attacked him and Jasmine, causing fear. It was then that the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] arrived, with the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] at giant size.{{r|Micronauts #16}}

The Psycho-Man defeated both teams and trapped them in transparent tubes atop of the Psycho-Manipulator. But they attacked each others tubes and escaped. Bug crossed the keyboard but came under attack from Reptos, with the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]] making him invisible until he got inside the device. The Psycho-Manipulator now drained energy from Psycho-Man instead of feeding it to him; causing him to transfer to another set of armor.

Bug left the Psycho-Manipulator, thinking he was still invisible. Jasmine saw a Repto about to attack him and intercepted it. The Repto attacked her instead and killed her. The Fantastic Four then headed back to Earth.{{r|Micronauts #17}}

They travelled to Earth and Bug buried Jasmine in Rann's hibernation couch, where he spent a thousand years in suspended animation. When Mari asks why, he said, "I plan to spend the rest of my life awake!" Bug wandered off to grieve.{{r|Micronauts #18}}

===Ant-Man===
Having wandered away from the other Microns, Bug came across a barnyard. He evaded a cow, a chicken, and a pig, to whom he was just another insect. A human sprayed him, put him in a glass box, and sent a mutagen gas into the box. Biotron picked up Bug's brain waves. The Endeavor tracked them to the barn. The human, warned by his army of insects, knocked the ship out of the air with a pitchfork. Rann and Acroyear glided out to attack him. He shot the Endeavor with a shotgun and grabbed Rann. He told Rann that he was [[John Judson (Earth-616)|Odd John]], who had always loved and understood insects. He developed his mutagen gas to give the insects a level playing field in evolution.

Acroyear punched Odd John, which freed Rann. Odd John called up his insects to attack the Endeavor, and Bug led them. Rann recognized Bug, mutated as he was, and warned Acroyear, who was about to attack Bug. Bug blasted Acroyear and Odd John gassed Rann, preparing to pin him to the wall with the rest of his collection. In a nearby township, ants swarmed into the home of Scott Lang, who was on vacation. He changed to Ant-Man and follows them.{{r|Micronauts #19}}

Odd John, the insect fanatic, had captured Arcturus Rann and was about to pin him to a specimen board. Mari leapt onto a hammer handle, levering the hammer into Odd John's head and knocking him unconscious. On his way down, he hit his head against his Telepatho-Communicator, a device that allowed him to communicate with his mutant insects. Acroyear chained Odd John to a post. When Odd John awakened, he said that he can't call back his insects because the Telepatho-Communicator is broken, but he guessed that without instructions they'd look for food. The Microns went after Bug, who was leading the insect army.

Following Bug's brain waves, the Endeavor and the Astrostation went to Food World, a supermarket in a nearby town. Ant-Man, following a swarm of ants, arrived first, but Bug shot down the ant he was riding. The Endeavor flew into the store. Bug shot a clerk with his rocket-lance. The customers panicked and fled the store. Rann, Mari, Acroyear, and Cilicia used their gliders to go after Bug. Not recognizing his friend, Bug blasted Acroyear, who flew into a freezer and broke a coolant pipe; the escaping gas froze him to the shelf. Bug next shot Rann and Mari, who fell into a box of garbage, which rolled to the end of a conveyor and got tossed into a garbage truck.

A mutant insect got to the bridge of the Endeavor and forced Biotron away from the controls. The ship crashed. Microtron, piloting the Astrostation, helped Cilicia get Acroyear out of the freezer. A mutant ant grabbed Ant-Man. One of its claws punctured a canister of shrink gas, and the escaping gas turned the mutant ant back into a regular ant. Ant-Man released another canister of shrink gas in the air conditioning system, which mad all the insects revert to normal, including Bug.

Ant-Man hitched a ride on the Endeavor. He and Biotron went back to Odd John's farm, while the others used the Astrostation to search for Rann and Mari. Lang promised not to mention the Microns when he turned Odd John over to the authorities.{{r|Micronauts #20}}

===Annihilus===
During one mission, Bug came across [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]] who sought to incorporate the reality powers into his [[Cosmic Control Rod]], but was teletransported to the Microverse. Bug tried to stop him, but Annihilus' powers transported both of them to Earth, but in the past. The two battled each other travelling through time and witnessing the origins of various heroes. Eventually, Bug arrived at time where the past Annihilus got the reality powers from some detached floors of the [[Baxter Building]]. Bug used the Rod to deny the past Annihilus entry to the building, and ensuring that their battle never took place.{{r|Bug Vol 1 1}}

===[[Annihilation: Conquest]]===
[[File:Bug (Earth-616) from Annihilation Conquest - Starlord Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left]] 
During one of his adventures, Bug was eventually captured by the [[Kree Empire]], but was freed on the condition to join [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]]'s new team against the [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]] invasion.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord Vol 1 1}} The team was a pretty dysfunctional one, with Peter seeing them more as an expendable team rather than allies in battle. They sneaked through most of the Phalanx-invaded [[Hala]], looking for the bio-tech reproduction facility, when suddenly a battle between some of Annihilus' remaining bugs and the Phalanx broke out. [[Sharra Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathcry]] jumped into the battle, revealing the rest of the team. During the battle, Deathcry attacked [[Gabriel Vargas (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]], and in an act of self defense, Captain Universe disintegrated Deathcry. The team retreated and was also forced to leave [[Groot (Earth-616)|Groot]] behind as he covered their escape.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord Vol 1 2}}

After two days of no luck finding the facility, Peter went alone on a reconnaissance mission to find it. He looked through classified Kree archives, and there he found that they had already released the virus as a airborne nanovirus — meaning that everyone on the planet were slowly becoming infected. He returned back to the sewers where he told the team of his plan. Not long after, they were attacked by the Phalanx. Captain Universe covered their escape and they made it out into the streets of Hala. However, Peter, [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]], Bug, and a tiny little Groot (who regrew after his destruction) were captured on the street not long afterwards. [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]] was able to turn herself invisible and Captain Universe defeated all of the Phalanx down in the sewers, so they weren't captured. Peter and his teammates were later about to be dissected by the Phalanx, but Mantis and Captain Universe saved them. They made their escape, only to find Kree soldiers in their way. The Kree soldiers decided to let Peter and company go due to Peter's reputation as the Starlord. They commandeered a Kree ship and flew out of Hala to [[Alon-Gim]]. Since Captain Universe got the genetic information of the virus when he was rescuing the team, the Kree were able to come up with a cure. Also, the team was clean of infection. The team came to Peter saying they were ready for the next assignment, despite Peter's clear unwillingness.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord Vol 1 3|4}} Bug then continued working with the team against the Phalanx.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest Vol 1 2|6}}

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
Bug was later recruited to the galactic team of heroes known as the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. However he was annoyed that he was not asked to be on the first roster of the team, and always questioned why he wasn't. On his first mission with the team, they battled the race known as the [[Badoon]]. The Badoon were testing weapons on a unsuspecting planet.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 7}}

Later the team splits up convince the [[Inhumans]] and the [[Shi'ar]] to stop their [[War of Kings]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 13}} Bug travelled to the [[Kree]] planet [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]], where he by accident insults [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Queen Medusa]] and starts a fight. Things escalate further when [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-616)|Phyla-Vell]] took [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]] as a hostage against [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star Lord]]'s orders.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 14}}

The team traveled back to the base, better known as [[Knowhere]], they found themselves in a fight between the Inhumans led by [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] and the [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Shi'ar Imperial Guard]]. During the battle, [[Starhawk]] escaped who was imprisoned at the time. Starhawk then transported Bug and several others to her [[Earth-669116|timeline]].

===Earth-669116===
Starhawk eventually convinced them she was not a threat and that Black Bolt would be the one to create the Fault, a rip in space time that destroyed her timeline. Starhawk went on to explain to the 21st century Guardians that they had slipped into another iteration of the future, which was constantly in flux. As a result, the timestream was seeing them as anomalies and was rejecting them in certain ways. As for the matter of [[Jack Harrison (Earth-616)|Jack Flag]], he was actually slipping into adjacent dimensions and therefore, would disappear from reality.

Seeing as they needed to get back to the [[Earth-616|21st Century]] as soon as possible, the Guardians decided to sneak into [[Avengers Mansion]], which was now the Keepers' command center. Using the tunnels leading to the mansion, they gained access to an underground vault, containing all of the Avengers' arsenal, including [[Time Platform]]. But before they could use it, the Guardians suddenly tumbled through different versions of the future, before landing in a future where [[Magus (Earth-7528)|Magus]] and the [[Universal Church of Truth (Earth-616)|Universal Church of Truth]] ruled.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 18}}

Then suddenly, Bug and the team were rescued by [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]] and an entire flock of Starhawks. Taking refuge in Kang's dwelling place called [[Limbo (Temporal)|Limbo]], where he restored the Guardians to their rightful ages, he explained that they must stop Adam Warlock when he became the Magus. He gave them a [[Cosmic Cube]] to expand the time window they needed to kill Adam after he stopped the Fault from expanding. He personally couldn't go back to stop Magus, otherwise he'd see him coming. But they were anomalies in time and unlikely to be noticed.

Unfortunately, the Church of Universal Truth stormed Limbo, forcing Kang to send the Guardians back to their rightful time. They arrived just in time to stop Phyla-Vell from assassinating Adam. Star-Lord, armed with the Cube, then attempted to convince Adam to prevent his evil side from awakening. But it was too late, as Magus surfaced. He killed them when they attempted to stop him. Drax attempted to kill him the same way he did with Thanos: by pulling out his heart. But, being a powerful being, Magus easily regenerates. With no choice left, Star-Lord used the cube to repress Magus, before killing him. While the Church templeships exploded all around them due to the death of their leader, the Guardians returned to Knowhere to tell [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]] of the losses they sustained.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 19}}

===Thanos Imperative===
After the resurrection of [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] and the invasion of the universe by the evil [[Mar-Vell (Earth-10011)|Lord Mar-Vell]] from the [[Earth-10011|Cancerverse]]. Bug and the Guardians of the Galaxy travel to the Cancerverse to take on the threat head on.

At the request of [[Arcturus Rann (Earth-616)|Arcturus Rann]], Bug returned to the Microverse to assist Arcturus and become part of the [[Glossary:Enigma Force|Enigma Force]], whose mission was to defeat [[Hiro-Kala (Earth-616)|Hiro-Kala]] and return the planet [[K'ai]] back to the Microverse.

===Knowhere Corps===
Bug later joined the [[Knowhere Corps (Earth-616)|Knowhere Corps]] and helped arrest [[Yotat (Earth-616)|Yotat]] on the planet [[Knowhere]] alongside his fellow teammates. However, [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax]] wanted to finish Yotat off there and then.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 5}}

===Further Adventures===
When some [[Ghlteyks]] were manipulated into attacking Earth, Bug joined forces with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] to find who behind this.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 41}} After battling some more Ghlteyks, they were temporarily knocked out by some of [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]]'s henchmen, but the heroes were able to defeat them and get the information they needed.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 42}} After analyzing the excretion they found attached to underground tunnels formed the Ghlteyks contained energy similar to that of the Negative Zone, which could open a portal between Earth.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 44}} He then build a device to control the Ghlteyks which allowed Spider-Man and Deadpool to defeat Blastaar's forces.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 45}}

Bug was then captured and brainwashed by the [[Universal Church of Truth (Earth-TRN666)|Universal Church of Truth]] from an [[Earth-TRN666|alternate future]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 11}} He was freed from their control when Rocket Raccoon reprogramed their ship's engine, sending the Church back to their original timeline.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 5 12}}

Bug was among the heroes summoned by [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] to help fight the Scourge from the Cancerverse led by [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|Void]]. In the end, the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] managed to remerge [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Bob Reynolds]] with the Void, while Richard Rider sacrificed himself to defeat the monsters.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge Omega Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  =  '''Insectivorid Physiology:''' Bug's native abilities are considered superhuman compared to other humanoids he has great strength, speed, stamina, agility, durability, reflexes, recuperative powers, balance, coordination, and sense of equilibrium.

* '''Superhuman Strength:''' Bug possesses superhuman strength enabling him to press lift great weights. Bug's physical strength is sufficient to lift and throw objects as heavy as most standard automobiles with ease. He must also pull his punches and kicks unless fighting someone of similar or greater physical durability. Otherwise, his blows would prove fatal to most being. He has demonstrated that he strong enough enable him to knock out people with normal durability with as little as a tap to the head. Bug's physical strength also extends into his legs, enabling him to be able to jump to a height of several stories in a single bound.

* '''Superhuman Speed:''' Bug can run and move at speeds that are beyond the physical limits of the finest human athlete.

* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Bug's advanced musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him. At his peak, Bug can physically exert himself for several hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him.

* '''Superhuman Durability:''' Bug's body is physically tougher and more resistant to some types of injury than other beings. His body is more resistant to impact forces than anything else. He can withstand great impacts, such as falling from a height of several stories or being struck by a super-humanly strong opponent, that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no discomfort, Bug's durability is sufficient that he survived with no serious injury other than a sore body.

* '''Superhuman Agility:''' Bug's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are all enhanced to levels that are beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete. Bug is extraordinarily limber and his tendons and connective tissues are twice as elastic as the average human being's, despite their enhanced strength. He has the combined agility and acrobatic prowess of the most accomplished circus aerialists and acrobats.

* '''Superhuman Equilibrium:''' Bug possesses the ability to achieve a state of perfect equilibrium in any position imaginable. He seems able to adjust his position by instinct, which enables him to balance himself on virtually any object, no matter how small or narrow. He has developed a unique fighting style that made full use of his agility, strength, and equilibrium.

* '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' Bug's [[reflexes]] are greater than those of an ordinary human. In combination with his danger-sense, the speed of his reflexes allows him to dodge almost any attack, even direct gunfire, if he is far enough away.

* '''Wall-Crawling:''' Bug's has the the ability to cling to surfaces and scale them like any insect.

* '''Danger-sense:''' He also possesses a "danger-sense" (similar to [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]) which alerts him to danger. This takes the form of a tingling sensation at the base of his skull.
