| HistoryText             = Technet was a team of bounty hunters from various extradimensional worlds. For a price, Technet would hunt and capture fugitives, rescue prisoners from captivity, or recover objects of value. The scope of Technet extended across multiple worlds and dimensions.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 4}}

The first known appearance of Technet occurred when they were hired by [[Opul Lun Sat-Yr-Nin (Earth-794)|Sat-Yr-9]] to find the fugitive [[Byron Bra-Dhok (Earth-794)|Byron Bra-Dhok]], better known as [[Kaptain Briton]], the [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]] counterpart of [[Earth-794|Sat-Yr-9's Earth]]. Kaptain Briton fled to the [[Earth-616]], fought with his counterpart and exchanged uniforms with him, hoping to confuse Technet. Technet mistakenly took Brian prisoner and brought him to Sat-Yr-9's Earth. Captain Britain managed to convince Technet that they had the wrong target, so they joined Braddock in fighting Sat-Yr-9's troops. After returning to his own Earth, Braddock discovered that his sister [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] had killed Kaptain Briton after he had attacked her.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 3|6}}

Later, Technet traveled on business to the [[Wereworld]], whose natives become [[Werewolves]] under a full moon, having been exiled from their home by Sat-Yr-9.  There, Technet member [[Elmo (Earth-TRN298)|Elmo]] was fatally wounded by werewolves. Subsequently, [[Gatecrasher (Earth-TRN295)|Gatecrasher]] either seriously injured or killed a member of the Berserker Pirates who attempted to interest her in becoming his lover. The pirate's family forced Technet to turn over all their accumulated wealth as reparations. Angered by this reversal in their fortunes, all of the members of Technet except for [[Yap (Earth-TRN307)|Yap]] and [[Fascination (Special Executive)|Fascination]] left the team.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 12}}

Shortly thereafter, Gatecrasher went to a celebration held by the despot of Kandahar. A person she believed to be the despot himself hired her to procure a perfect mathematical model of the universe that was made of rock crystal and that was held and revered by the Incas of 14th century Peru on Earth-616. Gatecrasher, Yap, and Fascination journeyed through time to obtain the model, but Gatecrasher and Yap were tricked by the person they believed to be a native high priest into consuming fruit filled with the eggs of deadly parasites. Gatecrasher and Yap were thus forced to remain under a cooling waterfall to prevent the eggs inside them from hatching and consuming their bodies from within. In actuality, an alien had impersonated both the despot of Kandahar and the high priest, and hoped to force Fascination into his employ through this convoluted plot. This alien had already succeeded in hiring the members of Technet who had just left the group. His team was the [[Special Executive (Multiverse)|Special Executive]], a future version of Technet. The team's precognitive, [[Cobweb (Special Executive)|Cobweb]], told him that Fascination wouldn't join the Special Executive for another 300 years.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 12}}

Fascination brought Captain Britain and his companion [[Meggan Puceanu (Earth-616)|Meggan]] to 14th century Peru to rescue Gatecrasher. Captain Britain gathered together the plants necessary to create the antidote that would kill the parasite eggs. Gatecrasher and Yap consumed the antidote, and then they, Fascination, Captain Britain, and Meggan returned to their own time period.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 12}}

Gatecrasher recruited [[Numbers (Earth-TRN301)|Numbers]] and [[Waxworks (Earth-TRN298)|Waxworks]] into Technet, and all of the surviving former members rejoined. At some point during this period, Fascination changed her name to Scatterbrain.<ref>Prior to {{cl|Excalibur Special Edition Vol 1 1}}</ref>

[[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Opal Luna Saturnyne]] hired Technet to capture [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]], alias Phoenix, whom Saturnyne claimed was a threat to the universe. At this time, Rachel was on the run from [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]], who had enslaved her to star in his movies. Mojo sent his servants, the [[Warwolves]], after Rachel. The Warwolves and the Technet fought over Rachel and during the fight, [[Ferro (Earth-TRN299)|Ferro]] was killed. Rachel was saved by Captain Britain, Meggan, and her fellow [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]]. Together they fought off the Technet. This battle against Technet led directly to the formation of the original [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] by Summers and her allies.{{r|Excalibur Special Edition Vol 1 1}}

It was later revealed that Saturnyne had hired Technet under orders of [[Roma (Earth-616)|Roma]], who needed to form the superhero team to save the multiverse.{{r|Excalibur #42}} Later, several members of the Special Executive including [[Wardog (Special Executive)|Wardog]], [[Cobweb (Special Executive)|Cobweb]], and [[Zeitgeist (Special Executive)|Zeitgeist]] appeared and recruited many of Technet again, but Technet have since been active once more. Their precise chronology remains unclear.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 47}}
