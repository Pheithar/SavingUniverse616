===Origins===
When the sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] named [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]] first came into existence by the hand of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and manifested in the form of a scared child, it used her power of omnipresence to secretly seek the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|clone]] of the original [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]]. The Red Skull once had in his possession a Cosmic Cube that was eventually shattered by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. When S.H.I.E.L.D. used one of its fragments to create Kobik, its connection with the Red Skull passed on to Kobik. The Red Skull took advantage of Kobik's naivety to indoctrinate her in the ways of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] behind S.H.I.E.L.D.'s back. The Red Skull then executed his greatest scheme, and had Kobik turn Captain America into the best version of himself, which for Kobik, entailed he had to be loyal to Hydra.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 2}}

To this end, Kobik used her omnipotent powers to create [[Earth-61311|an alternate timeline]] in which Steve Rogers was proselytized into Hydra when he was a kid.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}}{{r|Secret Empire Omega Vol 1 1}}

===Early Life===
In this new timeline, the young Steve Rogers first came into contact with [[Hydra (Earth-61311)|Hydra]] when he was six years old in 1926,<ref group="note">{{cl|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 1}} establishes this occurred in 1922; however, {{cl|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 3}} corrects this date to 1926</ref> after his mother [[Sarah Rogers (Earth-61311)|Sarah]] was introduced by high-ranking member [[Elisa Sinclair (Earth-61311)|Elisa Sinclair]] into a local community run by Hydra.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 1}} When Elisa had Sarah's abusive husband [[Joseph Rogers (Earth-61311)|Joseph]] murdered,{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 3}} Sarah attempted to leave with Steve. Elisa confronted her before she had the chance, and Sarah seemingly died in the ensuing skirmish when she hit her head.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 4}} Steve was then abducted to a Hydra training facility called [[Keep (Hydra Base)|The Keep]]. Elisa vouched for him, claiming he was the one they had been looking for.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 5}}

===Indoctrination===
Due to Steve's strong will, Hydra's earliest efforts at indoctrination failed. Because of this, he was regularly placed in solitary confinement and forced to watch reeducation films. In spite of his considerable academic abilities, Steve's poor physical condition and proneness to illness caused him to be rejected by both his instructors, namely [[Sebastian Fenhoff (Earth-61311)|Dr. Fenhoff]], and his peers. In 1934, during one of Steve's many attempts to escape from The Keep, he was convinced to stay by [[Daniel Whitehall (Earth-61311)|Daniel Whitehall]], the [[Kraken]], who encouraged Steve to prove himself and embrace Hydra's beliefs, to value collectivism over individualism and to pursue the leadership of the strong.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 6}} A year went by, and Dr. Fenhoff became to accept Steve due to his exhibition of leadership and dedication to Hydra's cause. Steve additionally met who would become his best and only friend, [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-61311)|Helmut Zemo]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 7}}

===[[World War II]]===
In 1936, when WWII was about to break out, Hydra decided to ally themselves with [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-61311)|Adolf Hitler]]'s [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-61311)|Nazi Party]] with the intention to manipulate them to their advantage.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 8}} In 1940, Steve returned to the United States on a mission to infiltrate the [[United States Army (Earth-61311)|Army]] and kill [[Abraham Erskine (Earth-61311)|Abraham Erskine]], the lead scientist behind the Allies' [[Project Rebirth (Earth-61311)|Project Rebirth]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 9}} After being rejected numerous times, Steve resorted to working at a diner Erskine frequented, with the objective to poison him. Steve caught Erskine's attention when [[Chester Phillips (Earth-61311)|General Chester Phillips]] recognized him from his many attempts to enlist, and praised his determination to serve the war efforts. Before Steve could poison Erskine, he was distracted by a robber. Steve attempted to stop him but failed miserably and got beaten up. This show of courage prompted Erskine to choose Steve as the subject for Project Rebirth's [[Super-Soldier Serum]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 10}}

When Erskine invited Rogers for dinner, Steve took the chance and attempted to shoot him. Erskine almost convinced Steve to put down the gun, so Helmut, who had been working as Steve's handler during the mission, finished the deed. Using a device created by Fenhoff, Zemo extracted all of Erskine's knowledge from his mind. Due to how far into the project they were, the Allies brokered a deal with captured Hydra scientist [[Arnim Zola (Earth-61311)|Arnim Zola]] to carry on Erskine's work. However, Zola remained secretly loyal to Hydra.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 11}}

[[File:Captain America Steve Rogers Vol 1 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
===Becoming Captain America===
Steve was then elevated to the peak of human physique by Project Rebirth, and by 1942, he joined the Allies' war efforts as Captain America. Of course, Steve remained loyal to Hydra and acted as a spy, passing on to Hydra intelligence about troop deployments, supply routes and even a new mysterious super-weapon.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 12}} In 1944, an attack of the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-61311)|Invaders]] on Hydra resulted in the imprisonment of Helmut and the death of his father and Hydra's leader [[Heinrich Zemo (Earth-61311)|Baron Heinrich Zemo]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 13}} Steve tracked down Elisa with the intention to kill her on orders from Hydra, who believed she was the traitor that provided the Allies with intel on the Zemos' activity. Elisa pointed Steve to Nazi leader the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-61311)|Red Skull]],{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 14}} whose machinations, including the death of Heinrich Zemo, allowed him to take control of Hydra and effectively subsume it into the Nazi party. Over the course of the following year, Captain America chased the Red Skull until finally confronting him in [[Berlin]]. Using Zemo as leverage, the Red Skull forced Steve to pledge loyalty to him. Frustrated and disheartened, Steve set out to leave the war until Elisa informed him about the Allies' new super-weapon, a Cosmic Cube.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 15}}

In order to lift his spirits for a final mission, Elisa brought Steve back to the Keep where he was reunited with his mother, whose head injury had kept her from reuniting with Steve all these years. In preparation for the mission, Elisa warned Steve about the reality-warping properties of the Cosmic Cube, revealing the Allies planned to use it change reality so they won the war. Elisa ensured with her powers of clairvoyance that Steve would survive the change and wake up decades later in the changed world, tasking him with the mission to restore the world as it was. After stealing the plans for the Allied drone rocket that killed Baron Zemo{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 11}} and freeing Helmut,{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 16}} Captain America traveled to the ancient city of [[Ashomia]] in [[Japan]], where he encountered the Kraken, as well as [[Isaac Newton (Earth-61311)|Isaac Newton]] and [[Michel de Nostredame (Earth-61311)|Nostradamus]]. The latter revealed Steve what his future held, and the chain of events that would allow for his return in this changed reality. When the Allies' use of the Cosmic Cube was sensed, Steve jumped into Nostradamus' pond to shield himself from the reality-warping.

[[File:Steven Rogers (Earth-61311) from Captain America Sam Wilson Vol 1 7 001.jpg|thumb|right]]
In this way reality was changed into [[Earth-616|one]] where Hydra didn't win WWII, and Steve Rogers never served Hydra.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} While genuinely fighting alongside the Allies,{{r|Captain America Comics Vol 1 1}} Captain America would become frozen in ice, and was awakened in the 21st Century by the superhero team known as the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], subsequently joining their ranks.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 4}} In truth, this is the way events naturally occurred, until Kobik made it so it could be believed the timeline she fabricated, in which Captain America served Hydra, was the original.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}}

===Arrival to the Present===
During a battle against the [[Ran Shen (Earth-616)|Iron Nail]], Captain America had the Super-Soldier Serum within his body neutralized, which caused him to immediately age into an elderly.{{r|Captain America Vol 7 22}} Later on, the clone of the Red Skull had Hydra double-agent [[Erik Selvig (Earth-616)|Erik Selvig]] propose to S.H.I.E.L.D. to use Kobik's reality-warping powers to create a prison for supervillains, where each inmate would be turned into a mild-mannered citizen. The Red Skull's further machinations led to a supervillain revolt breaking out when Steve was visiting Pleasant Hill.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 2}} In the middle of the crisis, Rogers was almost killed by [[Brock Rumlow (Earth-616)|Crossbones]]. Kobik took pity on Steve, and decided to return him to his prime. While it seemed like Steve was simply back in shape,{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson Vol 1 7}} in reality Kobik had the Steve from her timeline supplant him.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 2}}

Unbeknownst to the Red Skull, even though Rogers reported to him, he was actually despised by Steve. Believing that the Red Skull's vision of Hydra preached blind hatred and intolerance with the purpose to glorify himself, Captain America even set out to kill him in order to restore Hydra's former glory.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 4}} When ordered by the Red Skull to kill [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] and Erik Selvig, Rogers secretly kept both of them alive. While Steve convinced Selvig to work for him right off the bat,{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 3}} he kept Zemo prisoner,{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 7}} and talked him into eventually believing that his version of history was the original and that it had to be restored.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 11}}

[[File:Steven Rogers (Earth-61311) and Erik Selvig (Earth-616) from Captain America Steve Rogers Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left]]
===[[Civil War II]]===
Both the Red Skull and Rogers had to halt their operations in light of the appearance of an [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] with the ability to predict the future named [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses Cain]]. In order to test Ulysses' abilities and see if the emergence of more pressing threats for him to predict could be used to conceal his own schemes, Rogers planted the seeds that led to [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] being killed over a prediction, which in turn caused the friction between [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] to escalate into a war that split the superhero community.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 5}} In a turn of events, Captain America became the protagonist of another of Ulysses' visions, in which he was killed by [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Spider-Man]] in the steps of the [[Capitol Building]].{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 5}} Captain America joined Spider-Man in [[Washington, D.C.]] to prove the vision wrong,{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 7}} and witnessed the final battle between Iron Man and Captain Marvel.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 8}} Ulysses' vision involving him even invigorated Rogers' conviction. Even though the vision did show him dying at Spider-Man's hands, he managed to catch a glimpse of the scenario surrounding his supposed death, that of an America under Hydra's rule.{{r|Civil War II: The Oath Vol 1 1}}

===S.H.I.E.L.D. Act===
Under the orders of the Red Skull,{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 10}} Captain America secured [[Chitauri Egg|alien eggs]] containing [[Chitauri]] queens. The presence of the eggs on [[Earth]] combined with their instincts and simple-mindedness prompted waves of these aliens to regularly attempt to swarm the planet to get to them, with each wave growing in size and frequency.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 8}} The Red Skull's endgame was to have these aliens eventually overwhelm and destabilize the Earth.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 10}}

Taking advantage of the resurgence of the Red Skull's Hydra, Captain America supported [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]] in proposing to the Senate the creation of a bill known as the "S.H.I.E.L.D. Act." to expand the organization's power.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 4}} Not long after that, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] faced a tribunal to determine the future of her career due to numerous controversial decisions, namely the creation of [[Pleasant Hill]].  After Hill presented the plans of the impenetrable [[Planetary Defense Shield]] in an attempt to sway the tribunal of the [[World Security Council (Earth-616)|World Security Council]] in her favor, Captain America orchestrated the death of tribunal member [[Charles Dalton (Earth-616)|Charles Dalton]] to ensure Hill was found guilty and fired.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 9}} Hill went on the run and handed over the plans for the Planetary Defense Shield to the [[Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight Space Program]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 10}} Because the creation of the Shield could've compromised the success of the Chitauri wave, Rogers attempted to talk Alpha Flight Commander Captain Marvel out of building it. Carol still endorsed its creation to the [[Barack Obama II (Earth-616)|President of the United States]],{{r|Civil War II: The Oath Vol 1 1}} and secured the construction of its generator.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 11}} Having failed to halt the Shield's creation, Steve had his ally and hacker [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] hack into its security systems,{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 14}} and later on send Steve its access codes.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 16}}

[[File:Captain America Steve Rogers Vol 1 15 Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]
Captain America suggested Carter to replace Hill, but Sharon herself declined the offer and postulated Steve.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 10}} Rogers' assumption of the Director's chair coincided with the S.H.I.E.L.D. Act being signed into law with bipartisan support in Congress. The S.H.I.E.L.D. Act drastically expanded S.H.I.E.L.D.'s authority within the United States in areas concerned with law enforcement, mass surveillance, and resource allocation, also enabling the organization to become the de facto "top cop" in an event of a national state of emergency.{{r|Civil War II: The Oath Vol 1 1}} It even allowed, in case of national emergency, for the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. to take absolute control of the country.{{r|Secret Empire Omega Vol 1 1}}

===Opening Salvo===
Once Baron Zemo was on Rogers' side, he began to rally all of the supervillains that were inmates in Pleasant Hill, assembling an [[Army of Evil (Earth-616)|Army of Evil]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 13}} Additionally, Elisa Sinclair somehow resurfaced as the new [[Madame Hydra]],{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 12}} and began to gather powerful allies to serve as Captain America's [[High Council of Hydra (Earth-616)|High Council of Hydra]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 14}} Following his defeat at the hands of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]], the Red Skull had the portion of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]]'s brain that he had previously grafted into his own cranium surgically extracted.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 22}} Rogers orchestrated Red Skull's escape from custody solely so he could kill him himself, now that the Skull lacked the telepathic abilities Charles Xavier's brain granted him. Once the Red Skull was dead, Rogers consolidated power as the new Hydra Supreme, and reunited with Sinclair.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 15}}

After taking over the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] and seemingly killing the [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]], Baron Zemo secured Kobik. However, her humanoid form was destroyed in the process, leaving behind Cosmic Cube shards.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 3 12}} Before the Cube could be reassembled and used to change the world to match Rogers' timeline, Selvig had a change of heart and teleported the shards away, scattering them all over the world, before killing himself. Even though the plan consisted of taking over the world and reshaping it, Madame Hydra encouraged Steve to carry on with the first part.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 16}}

Two new crises were set up coordinately with the imminent arrival of a Chitauri wave of trillions of aliens: the Army of Evil's attack on [[Manhattan]] and the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]] [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier Crescent|''Crescent'']] dropping off the radar. Each of these crises were orchestrated to neutralize key elements in America's defense. The crew of ''Crescent'' had been brainwashed by [[Johann Fennhoff (Earth-616)|Doctor Faustus]], and establishing contact with S.H.I.E.L.D. allowed for his hypnotic message to spread out to the organization's entire fleet; the Chitauri invasion required the heavy hitters of the superhero community to hold them off in orbit, and Rogers subsequently sealed them off with the Planetary Defense Shield; and finally, the Army of Evil's attack served the purpose to lure countless of the nation's heroes to [[Manhattan]], so they could be enclosed in a dome of [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]] by [[Marcus Daniels (Earth-616)|Blackout]]. The state of emergency additionally had put into action the effects of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Act, legally putting the government and military in Captain America's hands. With these strikes dealt, Captain America mobilized S.H.I.E.L.D.'s entire fleet to take over [[Washington, D.C.]] and consolidate power over the country.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} A contingent of America's remaining heroes who hadn't been neutralized attempted to stop the takeover, but were swiftly defeated.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2017 Secret Empire}}

[[File:Captain America Steve Rogers Vol 1 17 Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
===[[Secret Empire (Event)|Secret Empire]]===
After some time having passed since Hydra's conquest, the people of the United States were getting accustomed to their new fascist regime, mainly due to the use of mind-altering substances in water supplies to increase docility and receptiveness. [[Homo superior|Mutants]] had been displaced to the sovereign land of [[New Tian]] and [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] were being held captive in detention facilities. A handful of heroes that hadn't become exiled formed the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]], an alliance of super-powered and civilian rebels led by [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] stationed in [[Mount|The Mount]] in [[Nevada (State)|Nevada]], and others under Hydra's influence joined Hydra's own [[Avengers (Hydra) (Earth-616)|Avengers]].

Following an increment of Underground activity in the area, the High Council pressured Captain America into laying siege to [[Las Vegas]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} Steve gave Madame Hydra the power to do carry out the attack as he was uncertain, and she did. Disgruntled by this event, Rogers set out to find the Cosmic Cube shards to reshape the world as soon as possible. Hydra proceeded to race the Underground to find the fragments, as the rebels had learned of their existence and hoped to use them to return Captain America to normalcy.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 2}} Hydra eventually acquired most of the fragments, and even raided the Underground's base to retrieve the only two shards they had collected.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 5}} This victory was not without a cost, as Madame Hydra sacrificed herself to protect Rogers from the detonation of The Mount.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 6}}

Another insurgent group, called the [[Red Room (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Red Room]], which was led by [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] and had Spider-Man among its ranks, attacked Captain America during a ceremony at the [[Capitol Building]]. Black Widow had set out to kill Captain America in part to prevent Ulysses Cain's vision from being fulfilled, which entailed Spider-Man becoming a murderer. When her attempt to keep Spider-Man at bay failed and the young hero confronted Captain America in an effort to stop running from his supposed fate, Black Widow tried to break up the fight, which resulted in her death when she was fatally struck by Rogers' shield. Natasha's death caused Steve's dismay to grow stronger, as it added to the unwilling casualties of his crusade.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 7}} Because of this, Rogers became determined to assemble the entirety of the Cosmic Cube, and take action to acquire two fragments that evaded him, those possessed by [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] in [[Wakanda]] and by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] in New Tian, respectively. Hydra went to war against these nations, capturing T'Challa and forcing Frost to surrender.{{r|Captain America Vol 8 25}}

[[File:Steven Rogers (Earth-616) vs. Steven Rogers (Earth-61311) from Secret Empire Vol 1 10 002.jpg|thumb|right|250px]]
At the same time, the Underground gained a second wind when they came across the final Cube shard, and used its residual reality-warping powers to influence the events that saw the Darkforce dome brought down and the Planetary Defense Shield destroyed.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 8}} United at last, a contingent consisting of almost every single hero mounted an attack on Washington, D.C. which proved to be successful. Even though Hydra's forces were decimated,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}} the Hydra Supreme confronted the heroes using a suit of armor that granted him the power of the fragments in his possession, which was enough to allow him to reshape reality in Hydra's image. [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Sam Wilson]] handed over the final fragment to Steve, and he proceeded to merge the Cube back together. However, with [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]]'s help, the Winter Soldier subatomically infiltrated the Cube as Rogers was assembling it. This act allowed Bucky to reach into Kobik's mindspace and bring out both her and the real Steve Rogers, who materialized in front of his fascist counterpart. After Kobik undid the changes to reality caused by the Hydra Supreme, the two Captain Americas battled. Following an arduous fight, the Hydra loyalist Steve Rogers was defeated. The heroes stood victorious, and in the course of the following weeks, the United States returned to normalcy.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}}

===After the Empire===
The Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers was subsequently imprisoned in a high-security facility called the [[Shadow Pillar]], but secretly had at least one Hydra loyalist as a guard.{{r|Secret Empire Omega Vol 1 1}} During his imprisonment, Rogers was visited by [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], one of the handful of heroes that he had manipulated into serving Hydra. Since his life was turned upside down as a consequence of Hydra's regime, Deadpool blamed Rogers for it. However, Deadpool left Rogers' cell almost as quickly as he infiltrated it, leaving with the promise to take something from him whenever he visited him.{{r|Despicable Deadpool Vol 1 292}}

The Supreme Commander's first attempt at a break out came by the hand of Baron Zemo, who had kept Hydra running following Rogers' fall.{{r|Punisher Vol 2 227}} The escape was intercepted by another vigilante who had been manipulated by Rogers, the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]], who had stolen the [[War Machine Armor Model 8|War Machine Armor]] and planned to use it against Hydra. The Punisher took down the helicopter Hydra was using to escape and defeated Baron Zemo. After the authorities arrived, Rogers was again apprehended.{{r|Punisher Vol 2 228}}

Imprisoned once more, Rogers ultimately received a pardon by the [[Donald Trump (Earth-616)|President of the United States]] through means of the [[Power Elite (Earth-616)|Power Elite]], who had began feeding a disinformation campaign to lead the public to believe that Captain America was actually the Supreme Leader all along, lining up with Rogers' arrest for the alleged murder of [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Thaddeus Ross]]. As he was leaving the Shadow Pillar with [[Alexa Lukin (Earth-616)|Alexa Lukin]], [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]] ambushed him, breaking his leg and melting his body. The Supreme Leader groaned in pain trying to recite Hydra's mantra in a pool of his own blood, as his body burst into flames.{{r|Captain America Vol 9 8}}
