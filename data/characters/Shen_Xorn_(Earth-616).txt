| Creators                = Chuck Austen; Salvador Larroca
| First                   = X-Men Vol 2 157

| History                 = The [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] found a mutant similar to [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Kuan-Yin Xorn]]. While quarantined he was examined by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]. He explained that he was Kuan-Yin's twin and his brain formed a black hole rather than a star. He claimed his brother had been affected by an outside influence, later revealed to be [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Sublime]], that caused his madness and posing as [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 157}}

While the X-Men faced the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood]], Xorn removed his helmet to draw them into the black hole, including [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] and [[Talia Wagner (Earth-2182)|Nocturne]]. Afterwards, he wanted some time to meditate on the subject instead of joining the team like his late brother. The black hole inside of Shen Xorn's head led to the [[Mojoworld]] where the Brotherhood members gave Juggernaut and Nocturne to [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]] for their freedom. Juggernaut and Nocturne later found a way to escape Mojo.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 164}}

===Hunt for Healers===
Despite having lost his powers during [[Decimation|M-Day]],{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 18}} Shen seemingly regained them some time later. He was visited by [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|M]] of the [[X-Men (Magneto's) (Earth-616)|X-Men]], who attempted to warn him about the [[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Dark Riders]], who were hunting down mutant healers. Shen declined her offer for protection however, telling her that he preferred to stay where he was.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 3}}

Shortly after his encounter with M, Shen was confronted by the Dark Riders [[Barrage (Earth-616)|Barrage]], [[Hard-Drive (Earth-616)|Hard-Drive]], and [[Deadbolt (Earth-616)|Deadbolt]]. They attempted to kill him, but Shen easily killed Barrage, prompting Hard-Drive and Deadbolt to escape, vowing to return with greater numbers. The Riders were later killed by Magneto and his X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 5}}

Magneto later visited Shen in order to be healed. Shen agreed to help him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 6}} Magneto trusted Shen enough to watch over the [[Sleepers (Earth-616)|Sleepers]] with the intention to have them protected while at the same time having them at his disposal in case the were needed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 14}} When the united X-Men factions launched an attack on [[New Attilan]] as part of a plan to destroy the [[Terrigen Mist|Terrigen Cloud]] that caused [[M-Pox]], Magneto had Xorn and the Sleepers march and become the overseers of the Inhuman population held captive at their home.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 18}} After the conflict with the X-Men ended, Shen relocated to the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] and left the Sleepers under the command of [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 19}}

===[[Secret Empire (Event)|Secret Empire]]===
Before putting in motion a plan to take over the United States, [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s leader, the [[Cosmic Cube]]-altered [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], made a deal with Emma Frost, which resulted in America's mutant population being displaced to a sovereign state in the West Coast that became known as [[New Tian]]. Furthermore, Rogers had Emma telepathically control Xorn, using him as a front for her reign while she schemed behind the scenes. This fact was unbeknownst to everybody else, even the advisors of New Tian's supposed ruler.{{r|Secret Empire: United Vol 1 1}}

===Mothervine Crisis===
Following the fall of Hydra's empire and, as a consequence of that, New Tian, Xorn disappeared. He was eventually tracked down by [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]] and the [[New Marauders (Earth-616)|New Marauders]] on behalf of an alliance between [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], [[Claudine Renko (Earth-616)|Miss Sinister]] and [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]] so that he could join their ranks. After he refused, the New Marauders tried to kill Xorn, but he was saved by [[James Hudson Jr. (Earth-1610)|Jimmy Hudson]] and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-21710)|Bloodstorm]].{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 24}} In turn, Xorn joined a patch-work auxiliary lineup of [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|the original time-displaced X-Men]], since most of the team was off in space at the time.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 25}} These X-Men helped fight against Bastion's attempts to capture some of the new mutants that had surfaced as a consequence of the global release of the [[Mothervine]] virus.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 26}} They then attempted to take the fight to the masterminds of Mothervine, but were defeated.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 27}} Xorn and the rest of the X-Men were freed by Emma Frost after she decided to turn against Miss Sinister and the rest of the alliance. When Emma Frost and the X-Men confronted the remaining members of the Cabal, Xorn decided to sacrifice himself, since he believed all of his attempts to protect mutants resulted in tragedy. Shen unleashed the full power of the black hole within him and drew Bastion in, but was absorbed as well in the process and seemingly died.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 28}}

===New Life on Krakoa===
Along with Kuan-Yin, Shen was presumably returned to life by the [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]], a group of mutants capable of combining their powers into a process of resurrection, brought together by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] as part of his plans for mutant ascension. The two brothers remained in the mutant-nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], founded by Xavier and his allies.{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}} He was one of the teleporters recruited into [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] to form part of their teleport team.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1}} The brothers were eventually hired by Legion to follow him around and disintegrate his brain if he ever lost control of his powers.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 4}} They assisted him using [[Alani Ryan (Earth-616)|Loa]] and [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]] to set a trap for [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]]{{r|Way of X Vol 1 3}} and when Onslaught possessed everyone in The [[Green Lagoon]] during a meeting between Legion and Xavier, the three ended up killing everyone there.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 4}}

| Powers                  = '''Miniature [[Glossary:Black Hole|Black Hole]]:''' Like his brother, Shen has a star for a brain. Shen's star manifested as a black hole. The black hole in Xorn's head allowed him to emit the same energies a normal black hole does. Most notably he gave off gravity. Shen's black hole was capable of sucking up instantly another being. Xorn was capable of reversing his black hole's natural state. That is, Shen could cause his star to flare up into a sun.{{citation}} He lost his powers during M-Day, but, by the time the Terrigen Mists hit Earth, Shen has seemingly regained his powers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 3}} 
* '''Gravitational Electromagnetism:''' Could feel the movement of energy and emotion on many scales. He possessed gravitational senses that allowed him to manipulate energy for a variety of purposes, including warping of gravity fields, sensing when a death had occurred in his vicinity, shaking gravitational particles in the air around him which allowed him to speak other languages, and to heal others.{{citation}}
* '''Self-Sustenance:''' Given the nature of his mutant abilities, Shen Xorn did not need to breathe, nor did he require food or water to survive.{{citation}}
* '''Telepathy:''' Ability to read minds.{{citation}}
