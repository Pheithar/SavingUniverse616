A young mutant with destructive mutant abilites, Siena Blaze had only used her powers twice before she became a fugitive in [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]] with her boyfriend, [[Wallace Benton (Earth-616)|Wallace Benton]]. During a shootout with the state police, Wallace pressured Siena to use her mutant powers to help them escape. However, the pair was soon greeted by [[Trevor Fitzroy (Earth-1191)|Trevor Fitzroy]] and his associate [[Bantam (Earth-1191)|Bantam]]. Fitzroy quickly killed Wallace after a sexist comment towards Siena, then summoned a “Cattle Car,” a futuristic vehicle used to transport mutants to work camps. Siena briefly saw an enslaved, future version of herself aboard the transporter as it drove through the police officers. Fitzroy then invited Siena to join the [[Upstarts (Earth-616)|Upstarts]], a group of young and powerful individuals attempting to score points by killing mutants. He told her that her anarchistic behavior had attracted the Upstarts' leader, the [[Gamesmaster (Earth-616)|Gamesmaster]]. Siena agreed to join after Fitzroy told her that her future self had told him how to find her in the past.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual Vol 1 17}}

===Joining the Upstarts===
As part of her initiation into the Upstarts, Siena Blaze shot the [[X-Men Blackbird|Blackbird]] out of the sky in [[Antarctica]] with an electromagnetic blast. The resulting crash injured the three leaders of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]: [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]], [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]]. When Siena discovered the X-Men had survived the blast, she killed her henchmen and destroyed her base, then set out to finish off her targets. 

Later, Siena ambushed the exhausted Cyclops and Storm and nearly killed them until Professor X prevented her from using her powers. However, this meant her powers were building to an uncontrollable level. Acting in unison, Storm, Cyclops, and Professor X managed to defeat Siena, though she simply teleported away and left a massive explosion in her stead. The trio of X-Men nevertheless survived as Storm used her powers to get them to safety. [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] later revealed there was no sign of Siena.{{r|X-Men Unlimited Vol 1 1}}

Soon after, the Gamesmaster telepathically summoned the Upstarts for a meeting. There, he revealed Siena Blaze had been awarded points for her attempt at killing the three X-Men leaders. The Upstarts were then informed the next target worth the most points was [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]], though Siena abstained from attacking the mutant.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 301}}

A few months later, Gamesmaster assigned Siena Blaze to obtain a DNA sample from [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggert]]'s son, [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Kevin]]. Siena ambushed Moira in her laboratory, though [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]] attempted to stop her. Siena, sensing Nightcrawler's teleporting through the electromagnetic field, disrupted his powers and caused him and Shadowcat to arrive encased in rock.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 72}}

Shadowcat freed the pair from the rock only to find Siena standing over them. She quickly phased Moira to safety, enraging Siena who created a massive explosion to destroy the building. She then discovered the disc with Kevin MacTaggert's DNA matrix only to be confronted by Moira, Nightcrawler, and [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Phoenix]], the latter of whom stripped Siena of her powers. Despite this, Siena scratched Phoenix across the face, then regained her powers when Phoenix became distracted. Siena teleported herself away to safety without the disc.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 73}}

Siena Blaze reported back to Gamesmaster, where she learned that [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] was responsible for her assignment. Sinister was enraged at Siena's failure until he learned that she had Phoenix's DNA under her nails. He extracted the DNA and allowed Siena to leave unscathed.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 74}}

Some time later, the Upstarts were tasked with killing members of the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] and [[Hellions (Earth-616)|Hellions]]. Early in the battle, Siena defeated [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]] and [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boomer]].{{r|X-Force Vol 1 32}} Siena later confronted [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Moonstar]] and [[Manuel de la Rocha (Earth-616)|Empath]] in [[Madripoor]] only to be mind-controlled by [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]]. Karma used Siena Blaze in attempt to trick Gamesmaster into believing the New Mutants had been killed.{{r|New Warriors Vol 1 45}} However, Gamesmaster knew of this ruse and controlled Siena Blaze's body to defeat the New Mutants.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 33}} He then continued to use Siena's body to defeat [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]], [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]], [[Dwayne Taylor (Earth-616)|Night Thrasher]], and [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Speedball]], the latter of whom saved the group from the full blast.{{r|New Warriors Vol 1 46}}

===All-New Exiles===
After receiving an invitation from [[Pantu Hurageb (Earth-616)|Reaper]] to meet in [[Florida (State)|Florida]], Siena found a chance to gain a few points for killing the [[Mutant Liberation Front (Earth-616)|Mutant Liberation Front]] member. This led to the pair, as well as [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]], being transported to the [[Earth-93060|Ultraverse]] where they became members of the heroic [[Exiles (Earth-93060)|Exiles]].{{r|All New Exiles Vol 1 ∞}}

Siena adapted to the role of hero surprisingly well. She felt a strong attraction to team leader [[Brandon Tark (Earth-93060)|Warstrike]]. Eventually she, along with Juggernaut and Reaper, returned to the [[Earth-616|Marvel Universe]].

===Death and Resurrection===
Though Siena Blaze had been absent for several years, she reappeared as one of many mutants captured by [[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X]] and forced into the [[Neverland|Neverland Concentration Camp]]. As with the other mutant prisoners, Siena Blaze was terminated in the camps.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 5}}

However, Siena was later seen among the mutants resurrected by [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]], briefly battling [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 22}}

===Return to the Upstarts===
Years later, Siena reappeared once again as a member of the Upstarts. She helped kill the [[Nasty Boys (Earth-616)|Nasty Boys]] in order to lure out Cyclops and his ragtag team of X-Men to [[Washington Heights]]. After a brief moment of words, the two groups engaged each other in battle. Siena attacked [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] which her electromagnetic abilities which proved successful against the sorceress but was knocked off balance by Cyclops' optic blast. Soon enough she became overwhelmed as they were outnumbered. Blaze fled the scene with [[Fabian Cortez (Earth-616)|Fabian Cortez]] and Trevor Fitzroy, leaving [[Shinobi Shaw (Earth-616)|Shinobi]] behind as a scapegoat.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 20}}

Siena was apparently killed after she and Fitzroy were detained by [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 21}}

| Powers                  = 
'''Electromagnetic Manipulation''':
Siena can disrupt a planet's electromagnetic energy spectrum, absorbing the energy into her body until she releases it, usually in the form of destructive blasts of energy. The released energy would tear a hole in the local electromagnetic field and repeated use of her power would theoretically destroy the planet. Even limited use of her abilities could potentially cause catastrophic ecological changes to the planet. She can also use magnetic energy to fly at 150 mph or to teleport herself along the planet's electromagnetic field, but every time she teleports she permanently damages the field at the point of departure, causing a powerful explosion.
