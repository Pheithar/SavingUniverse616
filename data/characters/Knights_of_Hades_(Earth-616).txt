The Knights of Hades were a group of demon knights from [[Mephistoâ€™s Realm]].  The spell-wielding exorcist Elspeth Cromwell unleashed them on Earth to attack a family of suspected witches, actually [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]], [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]], and their son [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin]].  Whatever control she had over them was lost when the blood of an innocent, Franklin, was shed in the ensuing conflict, at which point they simply went on a rampage.  Presumably, they were pulled back into the Netherworld, either when Mephisto pulled the Richardses and Cromwell into his realm, or when the demon-lord was defeated by Franklin Richards.  They have not been seen since.{{Citation}}
