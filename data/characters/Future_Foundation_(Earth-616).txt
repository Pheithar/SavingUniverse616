| HistoryText             = [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] has become discouraged by Earth's scientists' view of and applications of science which causes more problems. Richards decided to leave the Singularity Conference body, to put together a new group of free-thinking individuals to plan for a better future for all of humanity and Earth. Richards plans to mold the new young team so they will come up with solutions to the world's problems.{{r|Fantastic Four #579}}

The roster of the team consist of the hero [[Alexander Power (Earth-616)|Alex Power]], the android [[Draconus (Earth-616)|Dragon Man]], four evolved [[Moloids]] [[Tong (Moloid) (Earth-616)|Tong]], [[Turg (Moloid) (Earth-616)|Turg]], [[Mik (Moloid) (Earth-616)|Mik]], and [[Korr (Moloid) (Earth-616)|Korr]] and [[Bentley Whittman (Earth-616)|Bentley 23]] who is a clone of [[The Wizard (Earth-616)|The Wizard]]. [[Arthur Maddicks (Earth-616)|Artie Maddicks]] and [[Leech (Earth-616)|Leech]] later join as recruits.

[[Nathaniel Richards (Earth-616)|Dr. Nathaniel Richards]], the father of Reed Richards later joins the team with some newly discovered [[Uhari|ancient atlanteans]] [[Vil (Earth-616)|Vil]] and [[Wu (Earth-616)|Wu]]. Surprisingly [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] joins the team; this is the final request from [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]]. The most shocking of all the recruits was [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] who was invited by Valeria and Nathaniel Richards. [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|The Thing]] objects to his membership and attacks him, but Reed and [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Sue]] break up the fight.

Due the presence of alternate Reed Richards from the [[Interdimensional Council of Reeds (Multiverse)|Interdimensional Council of Reeds]], Mr. Fantastic made an alliance with many villains such as [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]], [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], Wizard, [[Esteban Coraz√≥n de Ablo (Earth-616)|Diablo]] and [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] to plan how to stop them. Then they lead the battle to High Evolutionary's [[Forever City]] where the [[Reed Richards (Earth-12498)|"Reed-Alpha"]] escapes with Doctor Doom to [[Latveria]], while the others two were captured by the [[Kree]] army and used to revive the [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]]. After returning to [[Baxter Building]], Richards reunited other heroes to fight the [[Universal Inhumans (Earth-616)|Universal Inhumans]] in [[Attilan]], but at the time they where preparing to go at the rooftop, a Kree invasion started. Reed used [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]'s [[Iron Man Armor Model 37|armor]] and Sue's power to create a force field around [[Manhattan]], at the same time the [[Cult of the Negative Zone (Earth-616)|Cult of the Negative Zone]] opened the portal to the [[Negative Zone]] after Spider-Man failed to stop them, the portal revealed a living Johnny Storm with an enslaved [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]].{{r|Fantastic Four #600}}

Meanwhile, the kids of the Future Foundation uses the Panic Room system to teleport the top of the Baxter Building near Latveria, there they help Nathaniel, [[Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)|Kristoff Vernard]], Reed-Alpha and Dr. Doom to rebuild the Bridge, so Reed-Alpha would return home. There, the [[Celestials#Mad Celestials .28Earth-4280.29|Mad Celestials]] tries to enter this Earth to destroy it. Doctor Doom and Reed-Alpha tried to stop them although Reed was killed using the [[Ultimate Nullifier (Weapon)|Ultimate Nullifier]] and Doctor Doom by the Celestials.{{r|FF #14}}

When Johnny gathered the team drawing with fire the symbolical "4" at the sky above the Baxter Building. Reed, Sue, Ben and Peter boarded one of the Annihilation Wave's ships controlled by Johnny, who used the rest of the ships to battle the Kree army until the Inhumans asked to finish them by their own hand.{{r|Fantastic Four #602}} Meanwhile the other heroes on Earth where dealing with the scraps of the battle which could damage the Earth, Reed and Sue summons Galactus, who destroys completely the Kree army. That moment, the [[Celestials#Mad Celestials .28Earth-4280.29|Mad Celestials]] appeared to destroy this universe. Although the team tried to use the Hub (a weapon of mass destruction created by the Reeds), they couldn't defeat the Mad Celestials. Then, a future version of [[Franklin Richards (Earth-10774)|Franklin]] and [[Valeria Richards (Earth-10774)|Valeria]] appeared as part of [[Nathaniel Richards (Earth-616)|Nathaniel Richards]]'s plan.{{r|Fantastic Four #603}} The Future Franklin used his power to heal Galactus and destroy the Mad Celestials, saving the day.{{r|Fantastic Four #604}} Later, the Baxter Building was easily rebuilt, Mr. Fantastic showed a new secondary headquarters called [[Foundation (Space Station)|Foundation]] and new costumes were given to the members of the Future Foundation, being the Fantastic Four reformed as part of it.{{r|FF #16}}

===Ant-astic Four===
The Future Foundation would soon be left in the hands of [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Scott Lang]] the current [[Ant-Man]] after Reed discovered that the cosmic energy that gave him his powers was decaying, forcing him and the rest of the Fantastic Four to go into a different universe to fix the problem. Scott was left with [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]], [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] and Johnny Storm's current girlfriend [[Darla Deering (Earth-616)|Darla Deering]] to be the replacement Fantastic Four for only originally four minutes unless something went wrong, which did happen.{{r|FF Vol 2 1}}

===Time Runs Out===
Reed and the Future Foundation began working on vessels capable of surviving the imminent destruction of the [[Multiverse]].{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2015 Secret Wars}} When the final incursion took place between [[Earth-616]] and [[Earth-1610]], Mister Fantastic gathered in the life raft every person he could and deployed its measures. When the vessel approached the central point of the incursion, it suffered a hull breach that led to the death of Reed's family and the members of the Future Foundation.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 1}}

===Secret Wars===
Reed later gained the omnipotent power of the [[Beyonders]] that Doctor Doom formerly possessed and rebuilt Earth-616, bringing all of its inhabitants back with no memories of what had occurred. Mr. Fantastic also brought his family and the Future Foundation back from the dead, and together with their help, began to reconstruct the entire [[Multiverse]] with help from the Molecule Man.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 9}}

===The Return of the Fantastic Four===
Years following the Future Foundation's multiversal adventures, a mysterious being called the [[Griever at the End of All Things (Multiverse)|Griever at the End of All Things]] who repudiated the Future Foundation's mission of creating new universes confronted the team as soon as Franklin was depleted of his ability to create entirely new realities. She killed the Molecule Man and caused the collapse of the hundreds of universes charted by the Future Foundation, forcing the team to make a final stand. The Fantastic Four were reunited when Mister Fantastic tricked the Griever into giving them the chance to summon the remaining members of the Fantastic Four for backup. In addition to teleporting Ben and Johnny, Reed also brought every superhero who had been part of the team at one point in order to defeat the new foe.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 2}}

With his allies, Reed tricked the Griever and forced her to retreat or risk being stranded in the reality they were in. While Reed, Susan, Valeria, and Franklin chose to return to Earth-616, the rest of the Future Foundation chose to continue exploring the Multiverse in hopes of restoring the Molecule Man.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 3|4}}

Mister Fantastic appointed Alex Power as leader. After the Future Foundation got trapped inside an asteroid with vicious creatures, Alex Power and Dragon Man used an interdimensional teleporter to get help. They ended up teleporting into the apartment of Alex's sister [[Julie Power (Earth-616)|Julie]]. Julie barely got a say before Alex and Dragon Man teleported her back to the Future Foundation's location. Julie quickly used her ability to fly to get everyone safely back to their ship. Julie decided to stay with the Future Foundation as her life had been falling apart and wanted to help the kids as a teacher.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 12}}
