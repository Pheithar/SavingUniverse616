| History                 = S'ym is the most physically potent native demon of the demonic realm called [[Limbo]], also known as "Otherplace."

Along with [[N'astirh]], S'ym is one of the better known demons of [[Limbo]]. He used to serve under [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]], an ancient evil sorcerer serving the Elder Gods. Belasco was seemingly killed by [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]], after which S'ym became Limbo's de facto ruler.{{Citation}}

S'ym and [[N'astirh]] took in [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]]. She was a clone of [[Jean Grey]], and the demons were going to use her in a demonic invasion of Earth starting with [[Manhattan]].{{Citation}}

At one point, S'ym posed as the green two-headed Duke Bleys.{{Citation}}

S'ym was last seen when Illyana Nikolievna Rasputina, formerly known as [[Magik]], returns to rule Limbo in her Darkchylde persona. S'ym, who used to be infected with the [[Techno-Organic Virus|Transmode virus]], is shown to be one of her servants now free of the techno-organic virus.{{Citation}}

| Powers                  = S'ym possesses great superhuman strength. He is stronger than [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-8280)|Colossus]] and easily snapped off one of [[James Howlett (Earth-8280)|Wolverine]]'s claws.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #160}} This strength level makes him nearly invulnerable. Illyana Rasputin's Soulsword was one of the few weapons that could kill him, before having been infected by the techno-organic virus. S'ym, now a techno-organic being himself, can repair himself and reform from a single molecule, should he be destroyed. Also due to his techno-organic state, S'ym can also infect other objects and feed off its life energies, and/or turn them into techno-organic beings as well. During the Inferno story line Illyana tried killing S'ym with her Soulsword but it proved ineffective against his new circuitry body.{{Citation}}
