Sometimes student, sometimes scientist and sometimes photographer, '''Peter Parker''' is a full-time super hero better known as the web-slinging and wall-crawling '''Spider-Man.''' An orphaned child, Peter was raised by his [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|Uncle Ben]] and [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|Aunt May]]. At a science expo, Peter was bitten by an errant [[Radioactive Spider|radioactive spider]] which granted him an array of arachnid powers. He initially became Spider-Man to use his powers as an entertainer, growing so conceited he didn't bother stopping a passerby [[Burglar (Earth-616)|burglar]]. In a twist of fate, the same burglar wound up killing Peter's Uncle Ben, leading him to realize that he needed to use his powers responsibly.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 15}} From then on, Spider-Man became a crime-fighting vigilante.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 1.5}}

Often a loner, Spider-Man is a stalwart member of the super hero community who has earned numerous allies like the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. He has made of numerous super villains his personal enemies, including [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]], [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]], [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]], [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]], [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]], and most notoriously, his nemesis the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]], who once killed Peter's girlfriend [[Gwendolyne Stacy (Earth-616)|Gwen Stacy]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 121}} Peter's support network extends to his civilian life, including [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]], [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Harry Osborn]], [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Flash Thompson]] and [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]], although the latter used to run a smear campaign against the wall-cralwer on his newspaper, the ''[[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Daily Bugle]]''.

Recently, after his start-up company, [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]], rose and fell,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 31}} Peter juggled his return to college with continued super hero activities, while also becoming the target of torment of a demonic entity known as Kindred,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 24}} secretly the artificial children of Gwen Stacy, [[Sarah Stacy (Earth-616)|Sarah]] and [[Gabriel Stacy (Earth-616)|Gabriel]]. The torment of the Kindred twins culminated in a final confrontation that Spider-Man emerged victorious from with the help of Mary Jane, leaving Peter free from the machinations of Kindred's true master, [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 74}}

<center>''This is an abridged version of Peter Parker's history. For a complete history see '''[[Peter Parker (Earth-616)/Expanded History|Peter Parker's Expanded History]].'''''</center>

===Early life===
Peter Benjamin Parker was born in [[Queens]] to [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|CIA]] agents [[Richard Parker (Earth-616)|Richard]] and [[Mary Parker (Earth-616)|Mary Parker]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #600}} who were killed by the [[Albert Malik (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] and framed for treason during a mission.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #5}}

[[File:Peter Parker (Earth-616) as an infant with his parents Richard and Mary Parker from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 600.jpg|left|thumb|Peter with his parents.]]
Before their deaths, however, Richard and Mary had another child unknown to Peter, a daughter and Peter's younger sister, [[Teresa Parker (Earth-616)|Teresa]].{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 302}} Following his parents' death, a young Parker was adopted by his uncle and aunt, [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|Ben]] and [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|May Parker]], moving in with them at their residence in [[Forest Hills]], [[New York (State)|New York]]. After their adopting of him, they became his surrogate parents and raised him as if he were their own son.

Over the years into being a teenager, Parker grew to be a prodigy in multiple scholastic subjects at [[Midtown High School]] and achieving high honors among his classmates. However, his reserved nature and enthusiasm for knowledge often made him a target for bullying, primarily football star [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Eugene "Flash" Thompson]].

===Becoming Spider-Man===
While attending a [[General Techtronics Laboratories East (Earth-616)|General Techtronics]] public exhibition, a 15-year-old Peter Parker was bitten on the hand by a [[Radioactive Spider|spider]], which was irradiated by the demonstration's particle accelerator. Oblivious after falling from his hand, the spider used its last pulses of life to bite a girl, [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Cindy Moon]], on the ankle before dying from the radiation.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 1}}

[[File: Peter Parker (Earth-616) bit by the radioactive spider from Amazing Fantasy Vol 1 15.jpg|right|thumb|The spider bite]]
Making his way home afterward, Peter was almost hit by a car until he leapt out of the way onto a building site a couple of meters high. Peter discovered he had somehow gained incredible strength, agility, and surface scaling; all spider-like traits that he immediately associated with the spider bite at the demonstration.{{r|Amazing Fantasy #15}}

Encountering an ad offering a cash prize for lasting three minutes in the ring with [[Joseph Hogan (Earth-616)|Joseph "Crusher" Hogan]], Peter decided this would be a good way to test his powers. Wearing a mask to avoid humiliation in case of defeat, Peter used his powers and easily defeated his opponent.

[[File: Peter Parker (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Introducing: Spider-Man!]]
TV producer [[Maxwell Shiffman (Earth-616)|Maxwell Shiffman]] observed his performance and convinced him to go on television with his 'act.' Designing a full costume and fabricating synthetic spider's web and wrist-mounted [[Spider-Man's Web-Shooters|web-shooters]], Peter debuted as [[Spider-Man]] to become an immediate sensation.

Following his first TV appearance, stardom fueled Peter in his Spider-Man suit failed to act to stop an escaping [[Burglar (Earth-616)|thief]], claiming that it wasn't his responsibility. Peter forgot the incident as his fame rose, but days later he returned home late to find his Uncle Ben murdered. Learning the police had the burglar responsible holed up in a warehouse, Peter changed into Spider-Man and easily captured him, only to discover he was the same thief he had allowed to escape earlier.

Filled with remorse knowing that his inaction leads to tragedy, he realized that when someone has the power they have an obligation to use it responsibly. From this realization of the gravity of events, he decided to become a vigilante superhero helping whoever he could.{{r|Amazing Fantasy #15}}

===Taking on Great Responsibility===
The first problem young Peter faced was the lack of money with the death of his uncle. Due to the fact that his Aunt May was too weak to work and Peter was seen as fragile, he decided to get a job, even though Aunt May wanted him to become a scientist instead. Peter even thought about using his spider powers for crime out of desperation but decided against it after thinking how his Aunt would react to him in jail.

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 546 Textless 2nd Printing.jpg|thumb|right|Peter's early career as Spider-Man]]
However, it was seeming impossible to him to find a job in order to pay his growing debts. As Spider-Man, he was not able to continue his career as TV star, because of [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]], owner of the [[NOW Magazine (Earth-616)|NOW Magazine]] and the newspaper [[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Daily Bugle]], who started a smear campaign against Spidey. Jameson would make statements that he was a bad influence for children and a criminal for taking justice into his own hands, referring to the situation with the burglar. Protests started taking effect and turning the public perception against Spider-Man, eventually causing Spidey's manager to leave him, impeding his ability to earn money even in costume.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #1}}

With these forced change of events, Peter searched through the wanted ads, only to be rejected by all the employers. Not being able to use his super-powers as Spider-Man infuriated Peter, and his fury only intensified after seeing his Aunt May selling her jewelry to try and earn some money.

Spidey's second heroic action was to save Jameson's astronaut son, [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]], from an accident in a deviated space capsule. Spider-Man hitched a ride on a small airplane and boarded the capsule during re-entry. Spidey then attached the missing capsule piece, allowing it to land safely. Although he had saved John, Spidey was still blamed by J.J. Jameson for the accident.

Later, trying to find a way to make some money, he decided to join the superhero team the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]. Spidey intruded into the [[Baxter Building]], battling the FF, as a way of showing them his power, but the team refused Spidey's entry after explaining to him that they did not get paid for their actions and that they were a family, not an enterprise. Later that day, the Russian criminal and master of disguise known as the [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]] used Spider-Man's identity to steal defense missile plans. The real Spidey was used by Chameleon as a pawn to escape the scene without problems.

After managing to avoid capture by the police, Spider-Man caught Chameleon in a helicopter before he could reach a soviet submarine and handed him in to the authorities.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #1}} Peter finally found a way to make money when the Daily Bugle asked for photos of the winged criminal known as the [[Adrian Toomes (Earth-616)|Vulture]]. Not only did Spider-Man defeat the villain, he also found a way to take photos, which caused J.J. Jameson to hire Peter to get him pictures of Spider-Man, under the condition that the publicist would not ask Peter how he took the pictures.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #2}}

Early in his career, Spider-Man fought many villains including the [[Phineas Mason (Earth-616)|Tinkerer]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #2}} [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #3}} the [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #4}} [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #5}} the [[Reynard Slinker (Earth-616)|Fox]],{{r|Strange Tales Annual #2}} the [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Lizard]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #6}} the [[Living Brain (Earth-616)|Living Brain]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #8}} [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #9}} the [[Frederick Foswell (Earth-616)|Big Man]] and his [[Enforcers (Earth-616)|Enforcers]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #10}} [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #13}} [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #15}} and his deadliest foe of all time: the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #14}} Several of these villains would form the [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Six]], under the leadership of Doctor Octopus, a team who tried to get Spider-Man by kidnapping Aunt May and trying to force Peter to "call" him. They failed.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1}}

During this time, Parker dated [[Elizabeth Brant (Earth-616)|Betty Brant]] of the ''Daily Bugle'', although [[Elizabeth Allan (Earth-616)|Liz Allan]] had a crush on him. At the same time, both Peter's Aunt May and their neighbor, [[Anna Watson (Earth-616)|Anna Watson]], were constantly encouraging Parker to date Anna's niece, [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]].

Before his high school graduation Peter continued to fight off menaces, including the [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Scorpion]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #20}} [[Spencer Smythe (Earth-616)|Spencer Smythe]]'s [[Spider-Slayer]]s,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #25}} the [[Nicholas Lewis, Sr. (Earth-616)|Crime-Master]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #26|27}} and the [[Mark Raxton (Earth-616)|Molten Man]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #28}} He also assisted the recently formed [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] in defeating a [[Spider-Man (Android) (Earth-6311)|Spider-Man android]] created by [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang]].{{r|Avengers #11}}

At one point, Aunt May's health got so bad that she suffered from a heart attack. Peter heard the news while he and the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] were fighting the Green Goblin, and he was forced to flee in order to get to her quickly. However, this only convinced the public-at-large that Spidey was a coward who had fled from a battle.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #17}} Die-hard Spider-Man fans like Flash Thompson continued to support him, while J. Jonah Jameson ran editions in the Bugle claiming that he himself scared Spider-Man off.

While looking after Aunt May, Spider-Man was forced to escape yet again from the Sandman in order to get home quickly. When he learned that his aunt's health had improved, he vowed to prove the world wrong about him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #18}} Meanwhile, a worried Torch tried to look for Spidey, but only managed to get captured by the Sandman. Spider-Man rescued him and defeated his enemy, wiping the smirk off of Jameson's face and getting the world to appreciate him again.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #19}}

===A Hero in University===
Eventually, Peter graduated from high school as valedictorian{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 16}} and enrolled at [[Empire State University]] on a science scholarship,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #28}} meeting new classmates such as [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Harry Osborn]] and [[Gwendolyne Stacy (Earth-616)|Gwen Stacy]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #31}}

[[File: Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 39 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Spidey Unmasked!]]
Even though he got off to a bad start with them, finally Peter became friends with them, as well as Flash. The Green Goblin came back and discovered Spider-Man's identity, kidnapping him and revealing his own alter-ego, that of Norman Osborn, Harry's father. In a furious battle, the villain lost all memories of his time as a supervillain.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #39|40}}

During that time, Spider-Man fought new foes such as the [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #41}} the [[Herman Schultz (Earth-616)|Shocker]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #46}} as well as teaming up with [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]] to defeat the wizard known as [[Xandu (Sorcerer) (Earth-616)|Xandu]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #2}} The Avengers also tried to make him a member at one point, but Spider-Man declined the offer.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #3}} Also, Peter finally met Mary Jane Watson,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #42}} but at that time he was interested in Gwen, so Mary Jane started dating Harry.

After finding an old newspaper clipping that identified his parents as traitors to their country in his aunt’s house, Peter decided to learn the full story, traveling to [[Algeria]] with the Fantastic Four's aid. He learned that his parents were supposedly spies who worked for the communist Red Skull and he came across their ID badges for the Skull's organization.

Spider-Man also stumbled upon the original [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi]] [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] and his men, who had previously worked for the other Red Skull. In the aftermath, Peter found his father's CIA identification card, proving to Peter that his parents were secret government operatives. With evidence to clear his parents' names, Peter returned to the States.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #5}}

Weeks later, after the return of Kraven and battling a new [[Raniero Drago (Earth-616)|Vulture]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #47|49}} Peter started wondering if he may be better off not being Spider-Man. Crime rose and a new [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] appeared in [[New York City|New York]], and abducted J. J. Jameson. Peter returned to his heroic identity, and Frederick Foswell, formerly the criminal Big Man, sacrificed his life to save Jameson's.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #50|52}}

A mystical artifact called the [[Lifeline Tablet|Tablet of Life and Time]] exhibited in ESU was stolen by the Kingpin; the Tablet passed over many people who tried to get it, including Spider-Man, Shocker (who was working for Kingpin) and [[Michael Marko (Earth-616)|Man Mountain Marko]] (who was working for the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] crime family).

Finally, the Tablet got to the Maggia boss, [[Silvio Manfredi (Earth-616)|Silvermane]], who forced Doctor Curt Connors to translate the tablet. Connors managed to create a powerful rejuvenation serum from it. Silvermane drank it and became a young man again. But the serum made Silvermane regress beyond birth. Meanwhile Connors, as the Lizard, escaped, and later was returned to normal by Spider-Man again.{{r|{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 68}}-[[Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 77|77]]}}

===The Death of the Stacys===
Soon after, Doctor Octopus managed to get his [[Doctor Octopus' Tentacles|metallic arms]] again and broke free from prison. After Spider-Man thwarted his attempt to hijack a plane, he started attacking the city's main power plant. Although Spider-Man escaped from Ock, Spider-Man was attacked by surprise by Ock the next day.

[[File: Peter Parker (Earth-616) and George Stacy (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 90 0001.JPG|thumb|right|The Death of George Stacy]]
They battled on a rooftop and [[George Stacy (Earth-616)|Captain Stacy]] died when saving a child from falling debris. Before dying, Stacy revealed to Spider-Man he knew his identity and asked him to take care of Gwen.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #90}}

Being accused of Stacy's death, Spider-Man faced some heroes who wanted to take him to authorities, such as the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Man]] [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]]{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #92}} and the beginner hero the [[Hobie Brown (Earth-616)|Prowler]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #93}} Peter even went to [[London (England)|London]] to prevent Gwen's departure forever, after her father's death.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #95}}

[[File: Peter Parker (Earth-616) with six arms from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 100.jpg|thumb|left|Six arms!]]
Things got worse. Harry became addicted to LSD, and Peter, along with Gwen and Mary Jane, took care of him. This familial stress caused Norman Osborn's Green Goblin persona to return, and he once again battled Spider-Man. During the battle, Norman was exposed to his son's declining condition in the hospital. This severed the control of the Green Goblin persona over Norman and caused Norman to have amnesia again.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #96|98}}

With his secret identity making his life impossible, Peter tried to give up being Spider-Man and created a cure for his powers that instead made him grow four extra arms.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #100}} With the help of Curt Connors he found a cure, fighting [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]] the Living Vampire and Connors' alter-ego the Lizard in the process.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #101|102}}

[[File: Peter Parker (Earth-616) and dead Gwendolyne Stacy (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 121 0001.JPG|thumb|right|The Night Gwen Stacy Died!]]
Norman Osborn's alter-ego resurfaced again and the Green Goblin kidnapped Gwen Stacy. Spider-Man found them at the [[George Washington Bridge (Location)|George Washington Bridge]], where they fought and Gwen fell from the bridge. She died when Spider-Man reached her with a web-line, breaking her neck.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #121}} The Goblin escaped. A furious Peter searched, found, and battled him again. In this battle Norman has impaled with his own [[Goblin Glider]], apparently killing himself.

Peter was extremely distraught over the death of Gwen, possibly even more so than when Uncle Ben died. An equally traumatized Mary Jane tried to comfort Peter after Gwen's death; she was initially brushed off, but they eventually got closer.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #122}}

After being accused of the death of both Stacys, and attending Gwen's funeral as Peter, Spider-Man was confronted by heroes such as [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Power Man]]{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #123}} and the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #129}} Later, Harry, who had discerned Spider-Man's identity and wanted revenge for his father's death, took the Green Goblin mantle and kidnapped Flash Thompson, Mary Jane and Aunt May in an attempt to lure him out and kill him. Spider-Man managed to find him at his father's old home and defeated him, leaving him to the authorities. Harry was sent to an asylum.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #136|137}}

===The Original Clone Saga===
Peter later had to go on a work trip with [[Joseph Robertson (Earth-616)|Robbie Robertson]], and he and Mary Jane shared their first kiss at the airport. After returning from the trip to [[France]], Peter found an alive Gwen Stacy, but could not bear to rekindle their relationship because of his kiss with MJ.

[[File: Peter Parker (Earth-616) vs. Peter Parker (Ben Reilly) (Earth-616).JPG|thumb|left|"Even if I live... I die!"]]
With the help of [[Edward Leeds (Earth-616)|Ned Leeds]], Spider-Man found out that [[Joyce Delaney (Earth-616)|this Gwen]] was a clone created by the [[Miles Warren (Earth-616)|Jackal]], who, after defeating Spider-Man with the help of [[Anton Miguel Rodriquez (Earth-616)|Tarantula]], was revealed to be Peter's professor, Miles Warren.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #148}}

After kidnapping Leeds and Spider-Man, Warren explained to the hero that he loved Gwen and blamed Spider-Man for her death. And after managing to clone a frog, he used a blood sample from Gwen to clone her. Later, Spider-Man was left unconscious in a stadium, where he battled a [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|clone of himself]] to save Ned from a bomb.

Gwen's clone made Jackal realize everything was wrong, so he freed Ned and the bomb exploded, apparently killing the Jackal and the Spider-Clone. Spider-Man took the corpse of his clone and buried it at an industrial chimney, while the clone of Gwen Stacy left New York.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #149}}

Unsure whether he was the real Peter Parker or the clone, he had Curt Connors run tests on him. However, he never checked the results, being convinced by his emotions for Mary Jane that he must be the original.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #150}}

===A New Appreciation for Life===
Peter had to leave Betty Brant's engagement party to defeat the Shocker, causing friction between him and Mary Jane.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #151|152}} Peter served as best man at Ned Leeds's and Betty Brant's wedding.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #156}}

[[File: Peter Parker and Felicia Hardy (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 194 0001.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Never let the Black Cat cross your path!]]
Spider-Man later faced Harry's psychologist, [[Barton Hamilton (Earth-616)|Bart Hamilton]], who became the third Green Goblin, and who, after various encounters, died at the hands of Harry.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #176|180}} Peter proposed marriage to Mary Jane,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #182}} but she did not accept, making their relationship falter. MJ moved to [[Florida (State)|Florida]] with her Aunt Anna.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #183}}

Spider-Man managed to clear his name, while Peter Parker graduated from ESU.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #185}} Also, Spencer Smythe, the creator of the Spider-Slayers, died from an illness after trying to kill Spider-Man and Jameson, the men he blamed for ruining his life.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #192}}

As Peter continued to live on his own, his Aunt May decided to transform her home into a senior citizens' boarding house. At one point, Mysterio managed to convince the wall-crawler that she had died.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #196}} Spider-Man later discovered that she had been kidnapped by the same burglar who had shot his Uncle Ben. After cornering him furiously and revealing that he was the nephew of Ben Parker, the burglar died of fright.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #200}}

At one point Parker began a romantic relationship and heroic partnership with the [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #194}} developing feelings for her and even starting to love her, although Parker later broke it off due to the Black Cat's disdain for Parker's life apart from being Spider-Man.

===The Alien Costume Saga===
When the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] kidnapped Earth's heroes to fight in his "[[Marvel Super Heroes: Secret Wars|Secret Wars]]"{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 1}} Peter Parker was with them. After his costume got damaged, Peter used an unfamiliar piece of technology to fix it.

[[File: Peter Parker (Earth-616) with Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616) for the first time.jpg|thumb|left|Spider-Man's symbiote costume.]]
However, his costume was replaced by an alien "[[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|symbiote]]" which shaped itself into a black costume. Peter, unaware that he was wearing an alien as a costume, used it as his regular costume. The symbiote was also able to create its own webs and change its appearance to look like regular clothes.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 8}}

Once the Secret Wars came to an end, Peter returned to Earth along with the other abducted superhumans and continued to use the black suit.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 252}} He eventually noticed the costume behaved strangely, so he sought help from the Fantastic Four's [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]], who discovered the suit was a living organism.

He helped remove the costume by force, and kept it at the Fantastic Four's headquarters in captivity.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 258}} The symbiote would later escape, plaguing the life of Parker again and ultimately merging with one of Spider-Man's critics, Eddie Brock, creating the villain [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]]. In a climactic fight, Spider-Man defeated this new foe.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 300}}

===Improving Life===
As Spider-Man, Parker met and fought alongside nearly every hero in [[Manhattan]], if not the world. Although he fought alongside the Avengers many times,{{r|Avengers #11}} he unsuccessfully (for now) tried to join their number when he learned of the financial stipend their members received. Parker helped them stop an invasion and subsequent breakout of the energy research and villain internment facility, [[Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. (Earth-616)|Project Pegasus]].

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 316 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Vs. Venom]]
Spider-Man was deemed, however, to disrupt the team's cohesiveness (perhaps due to either his loner nature, lack of experience, or annoying sense of humor), and was denied membership. Later, however, Spider-Man met the international mercenary [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]], often working on her behalf.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 265}}

Soon after a fight with Spider-Slayer,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 291}} Peter and Mary Jane married.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 21}} Spider-Man later defeated Venom in battle again. Peter's old friend Harry Osborn leased the couple a loft in the condo that Harry and his family were also living in. Mary Jane's cousin [[Kristy Watson (Earth-616)|Kristy]] also temporarily moved in with the Parkers at one point.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 145}} Eventually, however, the Parkers had to move into a room in Aunt May's house due to financial problems.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 314}}

At this time, Spider-Man once again allied with the Avengers to stop the alien [[Nebula (Earth-616)|Nebula]] from destroying reality with her Infinity Union. An increasingly unnerved Spider-Man, unaccustomed to dealing with cosmic-scale menaces, accidentally allowed Nebula to absorb the power of the Infinity Union, although the Avengers, Spider-Man, and the alien [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]] thwarted her regardless. Parker was told again that Spider-Man might not be suited for Avengers membership, although later he was inducted into their number on a provisional basis.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 314|318}}

Parker later returned to his studies and postgraduate work as a lab assistant at Empire State University.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 310}} During this time, Parker was briefly endowed with the powers of [[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]] and the [[Glossary: Enigma Force|Enigma Force]], in order to stop a series of robots, including the mutant-killing [[Tri-Sentinel (Earth-616)|Tri-Sentinel]]. Once the menace was defeated, the extra powers he gained left him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 328|329}}

===Kraven's Last Hunt===
{{See details|Kraven's Last Hunt}}
After being defeated once again, Kraven the Hunter's remaining sanity was destroyed. He hatched a scheme to finally defeat Spider-Man. While Spider-Man swung around the city, Kraven hit him with a tranquilizer dart. Spider-Man started hallucinating and Kraven knocked him down and captured him in a net. He shot Spider-Man with a rifle, apparently killing him.

[[File:Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616) from Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 131 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Kraven being the Spider]]
In reality, his drugs kept him completely immobile, so that Kraven could bury him alive. Kraven then donned a copy of Spider-Man's costume, calling himself "The Spider," he tried to become a better Spider-Man than Peter. He ended up brutally attacking and beating criminals, ultimately sending fifteen men to the hospital and killing one. The Spider confronted [[Edward Whelan (Earth-616)|Vermin]], who had resurfaced and killed various people, in the sewers. During the ensuing fight, The Spider overpowered Vermin and captures him.

After two weeks, Kraven’s drug eventually wore off and Spider-Man emerged from his grave. He learned from a newspaper that someone has been impersonating him for two weeks. He reunited with Mary Jane at their apartment before going to confront Kraven. However, he refused to fight, saying that by "killing" and impersonating him, he had proven his superiority.

Kraven led Spider-Man to a caged Vermin and released him, goading Vermin into attacking Spider-Man. At first Spider-Man fought back but then backed off, refusing to play Kraven's game. Vermin overwhelmed him and fled with Spider-Man following him. Having finished his greatest hunt, Kraven left a confession saying he impersonated Spider-Man for the past two weeks and then committed suicide with a hunting rifle. Spider-Man took down Vermin and handed him over to the police, who found Kraven's confession.{{r|Web of Spider-Man #31|32}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #293|294}}{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #131|132}}

===The Clone Saga===
Aunt May supposedly suffered a debilitating heart attack. This also led to the Parkers meeting [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Ben Reilly]], a clone of himself whom Peter had fought earlier. Reilly created a similar spider-costume, dubbed the [[Scarlet Spider]] by the Daily Bugle, and helped Spider-Man in his adventures. Shortly afterward, Mary Jane became pregnant, and the apparent revelation that Ben was the original Peter Parker and Peter the clone prompted Peter to retire from Spider-Man and relocate to [[Portland (Oregon)|Portland]].

[[File:Peter Parker (Earth-616), Gwen Stacy Clone (Earth-616), and Ben Reilly (Earth-616) from Spider-Man Vol 1 56 001.png|thumb|right|"Peter! I'm really Gwen... Aren't I?"]]
After a crisis in Portland resulted in minor damage to Peter's cellular structure that prevented him from accessing his powers, Peter chose to accept retirement and focus on his new family. Back in New York, Reilly eventually assumed the identity of Spider-Man himself, since the second villain by the name of [[Carolyn Trainer (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] tarnished the reputation of the Scarlet Spider.

After a few months in Portland, Peter and Mary Jane returned to New York, with Peter's powers returning after a strange illness was revealed to be his body 'resetting' itself, although his powers were unpredictable for a while and prone to cutting out at inopportune moments.

As Peter's powers returned, however, he and Ben began to contemplate the possibility of both of them acting as Spider-Man after the recent war against [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]] resulted in the loss of the FF and so many of the Avengers. This plan was cut short when Mary Jane was rushed to hospital while giving birth due to an unexpected medical emergency, later revealed to have been staged by Norman Osborn, the original Green Goblin; Osborn had survived his apparent death due to an unexpected increased healing factor as part of his powers that nobody had known about before.

Having stolen the body of Parker's baby, the Goblin revealed that he had manipulated the tests that confirmed that Peter was the clone and Ben the original with the goal of destroying Peter's life, angered when Peter had managed to move past that revelation to make a new life for himself.

During the subsequent confrontation, Ben Reilly jumped in front of the Goblin's glider when he sent it flying towards Peter, sacrificing himself to save Parker. Reilly's body disintegrated after his death, finally convincing Peter that he was the original. Due to this "revelation" and the fact that his daughter had died, Peter once again became Spider-Man.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 216|241}}{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 117|129}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 394|418}}{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 51|75}}{{r|Sensational Spider-Man Vol 1 1|11}}

===The Final Chapter===
After many more months of adventuring, Norman Osborn returned to take control of the Daily Bugle, providing faked evidence that he had never been the Green Goblin and discrediting all contradicting sources. He angered Peter, which caused Spider-Man to brutally beat Norman, which was all caught on a hidden camera in his house.

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 500 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Spider-Man with MJ Watson and his enemies]]
With the staged confrontation and the apparent murder of a small-time criminal using what appeared to be Spider-Man's webbing, Osborn was able to create the fake impression that Spider-Man was a straightforward criminal, and increased pressure was placed on capturing him. In order to continue his crime-fighting career and investigate the fraudulent claims, Parker relinquished his Spider-Man identity while creating four unique and separate ones: [[Dusk]], [[Hornet]], [[Prodigy]], and [[Ricochet]].

As Dusk, Parker was able to investigate the villain [[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Trapster]]-- the only person capable of creating a convincing duplicate of his webbing -- and convince him to confess to the crime to hurt Osborn and publicly exonerate Spider-Man of the murder charge. He also used Prodigy to present fake evidence that someone else had attacked Osborn dressed as Spider-Man, at which point he resumed his Spider-Man identity.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 434|435}}{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 257|258}}{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 91|92}}{{r|Sensational Spider-Man Vol 1 27|28}} Later, the Golden Age hero [[Daniel Lyons (Earth-616)|Black Marvel]] acquired the four costumes and gave them to four teenagers, forming a team he named the [[Slingers (Earth-616)|Slingers]].{{r|Slingers Vol 1|12}}

When the Avengers were attempting to reform their number after disbanding for a year after the crisis known as [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], Spider-Man was contacted due to his past affiliation with them. However, by his own choice, Parker decided to dissolve ties with the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 1}}

Aunt May was later discovered to still be alive; the woman who seemingly died was in actuality a genetically modified actress. Parker, Mary Jane, and Aunt May moved to an apartment in Manhattan.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 441}}{{r|{{cl|Spider-Man Vol 1 97}}-[[Spider-Man Vol 1 98|98]]}}{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 263}}

Peter had promised Mary Jane to give up his Spider-Man identity, but he would continually sneak out at night as Spider-Man. Their marriage began to strain, in part because of Mary Jane's new modeling career and in part because she discovered Peter's secret.

Before they could reconcile, however, Mary Jane was supposedly killed when her airplane exploded.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 13}} For a long time, Peter refused to believe her dead, but eventually grew to accept it. Peter discovered Mary Jane was alive, captured by [[Stalker (Psychic) (Earth-616)|a villain]] who had been stalking her prior to her airplane flight.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 29}}

After a brief reconciliation, Mary Jane requested to leave Peter once more, saying that she needed time to adjust by herself.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 42}} but Peter and Mary Jane later reunited.

===Totemic Adventures===
Peter soon took a job as a teacher at his somewhat beloved Midtown High. After getting this job, he encountered a strange man named [[Ezekiel Sims (Earth-616)|Ezekiel Sims]] who possessed powers very similar to his, and presented Peter with the possibility that his powers had been bestowed on him by mystical forces, effectively making Peter a "totem" that connected the animal and human realms.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 30}}

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 506 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Spider-Man and Ezekiel]]
Peter soon encountered villains linked to him through his new-found nature as a Spider-Totem. The first of them was [[Morlun (Earth-001)|Morlun]], who almost beat Spider-Man to death, and seemingly met his end after Peter injected himself with a lethal dose of radiation, which hurt Morlun whenever they made contact and weakened him enough for his servant [[Character Index/D#Dex|Dex]] to take the opportunity and shoot him down.

Following the exhausting encounter with Morlun, Peter let his guard down, allowing Aunt May to discover his secret identity when she entered his apartment and found him sleeping with his tattered costume on the floor.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 #31|35}}

After May came to grips with the fact her nephew was Spider-Man, their relationship grew stronger than ever.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 #37|38}} Mary Jane Watson also returned to Peter's life, and both lovers reunited for good.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 42}}

After defeating [[Shathra (Earth-616)|Shathra]], a predator who originated from the [[Astral Plane]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 #46|48}} Spider-Man was warned by Ezekiel about the coming of the [[Gatekeeper (Earth-616)|Gatekeeper]], a mystical being who allegedly saw Peter unworthy of his powers and wanted to kill him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 506}}

During an ensuing confrontation against Spider-Man, the Gatekeeper revealed him the truth. Peter was chosen to become a Spider-Totem due to his nature, a prey to bullying during his teenage years whose reserving anger made him the perfect candidate to become a hunter, one who would never give in to submission again.

Through visions imparted by the Gatekeeper, Peter also discovered that Ezekiel was the one Spider-Totem deemed unworthy, due to having searched for the source of the power instead of having it bestowed upon him, and that the predators that confronted Peter were actually meant for Ezekiel.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 507}}

As Peter was recovering from the encounter with the Gatekeeper, Ezekiel brought him to the temple where he had obtained his powers in [[South America]] and planned to use him in a sacrificial ritual to maintain his abilities. The ritual linked Peter's mind with Ezekiel's and made him realize he had wasted his gifts, unlike Peter. When a spider monster emerged to kill Peter, Ezekiel gave his life to save him.

A shaman named Miguel who had previously helped Ezekiel buried his body. When Peter asked him whether his powers came from science or magic, Miguel told him that one explanation didn't necessarily contradict the other.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 508}}

===The Queen and The Other===
Changes came to Spider-Man's very own physical nature when he confronted a new villain known as the [[Adriana Soria (Earth-616)|Queen]], who invaded New York and used her powers to take control over the citizens who possessed the vestige of an insect gene. As a consequence of a mutation caused by the Queen during a confrontation against her, Peter's body began to slowly transform into that of a giant spider which fell prey to the Queen's mind-control.

[[File:Adriana Soria (Earth-616) and Peter Parker (Earth-616) from Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 15 0001.jpg|thumb|left|The Queen killing Spider-Man]]
The Queen planned to use Peter's mutated body to breed, but it seemingly died due to complications arising from the transformation. From the husk of his monstrous form, Peter emerged alive and well, having gained the ability to produce organic webbing, in addition to augmented strength and spider-sense. During a subsequent fight against the Queen, Spider-Man disarmed a bomb she planned to detonate, and she was seemingly killed when [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] attacked her subterranean base.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 #15|20}}

Months following the disbandment of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], Peter joined forces with a fortuitous group of heroes present in the [[Raft|Raft Superhuman Security Prison]] to help contain escaping inmates following a massive breakout. Once the situation was contained, the group remained together and became the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], without the government involvement and financial burdens common to Avengers' history.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 #1|3}}

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 527 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Peter becoming something "else"]]
Peter, May, and Mary Jane subsequently moved to the team's headquarters in the [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] after both Peter's and May's places were destroyed by a mutated former classmate of his named [[Charles Weiderman (Earth-616)|Charlie Weiderman]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 518}}

Shortly after joining the New Avengers, Peter discovered that his skin was shedding for some reason. Knowing the situation was hopeless, Morlun got into a fight with him and brutally defeated him, even ripping his left eye out and eating it. The bloodied, rapidly shedding Spider-Man was rushed to the hospital with extreme wounds. Morlun attacked him there again. MJ attempted to stop him, but Morlun threw her across the room and broke her arm. However, Peter woke up and his savage, animalistic spider-side took over, developing sharp teeth and stingers in his wrists. He killed Morlun in front of Mary Jane, succumbing to his injuries and dying after.

[[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] took away Peter's body, but as the New Avengers mourned over his presumed death in another room, Spider-Man's body disappeared, leaving behind a shed skin. It turned out that his body had briefly sprung to life and formed a cocoon underneath the George Washington Bridge. In the cocoon, a voice told Peter he never understood what he was and is too scared to truly be a "Spider-Man," only focusing on his human part and not his spider part.

Morlun managed to kill the human, but the spider survived and killed Morlun to save them both. It told him that he would only be reborn if he accepted both parts, asking him: "Are you the man who dreamed of being a spider? Or the spider who dreamed of being a man? Are you the one...or are you the other?" Peter agreed and was resurrected with a new and completely healed body, as well as augmented spider-powers. He went to the Avengers Tower and reunites with MJ and Aunt May.

Shortly afterward, he encountered a being made of thousands of pirate spiders that ate his old body called [[Other (Spider-Totem) (Multiverse)|Ero]], who claimed that they are both parts of the same whole, that cosmic forces are vying for control of his life and that “she” is his opposite. She told him a spider-deity known as the [[Great Weaver (Multiverse)|Great Weaver]] had thought that his death was premature and revived him, but that others disagreed and were being pulled in different directions as a result.

Stating that she had come to kill him and restore the natural order, after a brief fight "she" was defeated and escaped. Changes resulting from the confrontation with Morlun and the shedding of his skin caused Peter to try and reconcile 'the man and the spider' within himself. While saving everyone inside collapsing building, he discovered he gained greater speed; poisonous, razor-sharp stingers located within his arms; night vision; increased sensory awareness via vibratory patterns transmitted through the hairs on his body and through his web lines; a greater clinging ability; and equal superhuman strength in order to carry heavy objects on his back.{{r|{{cl|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Vol 1 1}}-[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Vol 1 4|4]]}}{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #19|22}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #525|528}}

===Civil War===
Despite misgivings and with the support of his family, Peter initially sided with mentor Iron Man in support of superhero registration, after being unsure initially, as he felt that heroes needed to get public support for their actions. Many of the heroes on that side had public identities, with him being the only major supporter without one following Iron Man's unmasking; Iron Man also said it was a positive thing to unmask if they were to gain support.

[[File:Peter Parker (Earth-616) from Civil War Vol 1 1 0002.jpg|thumb|left|"Any questions?": Peter publicly unmasks]]
He planned to liquidate his assets and flee the country in case his unmasking caused any problems, but his family suggested against it, believing that Peter needed to get recognition for his actions. With Iron Man at his side, at a live press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]], Peter unmasked and said: "My name is Peter Parker, and I have been Spider-Man since I was 15 years old." His siding with the pro-registration heroes also saw him gaining the "[[Iron Spider]]" armor, which Stark had been building since Peter's death and resurrection.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 529|533}}

Reaction to the unmasking was diverse. Among the negative supporters were Jameson, who fainted upon watching the broadcast and came to "disown" Peter, having seen him as a son over the years;{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 533}} [[Debra Whitman (Earth-616)|Deb Whitman]], who wrote and published a scathing memoir titled ''Two-Faced: How Spider-Man Ruined My Life'', albeit under duress from Jameson;{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #14|16}}

Black Cat, who briefly went berserk for being left out of the loop, though she and Peter managed to work it out; Liz Allan, who blamed Peter for causing so much suffering in her life; and the Molten Man, who joined the Chameleon in order to avenge the grief and misery heaped upon his stepsister.{{r|Sensational Spider-Man Vol 2 29|31}} Besides Mary Jane and Aunt May, Peter had others who were more understanding and stood up for him, such as Betty Brant and Flash Thompson.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #15|17}}

[[File:Civil War Vol 1 3 Turner Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Spider-Man in the Iron Spider suit]]
However, fighting against the fugitive heroes and the existence of the [[Thor Odinson (Ragnarok) (Earth-616)|Thor clone]] and a prison for the unregistered in the [[Negative Zone]] created by Iron Man left a poor taste in his mouth, and he even found out that Iron Man was tracking him with the [[Iron Spider Armor]].

This caused him to get Aunt May and MJ out of the Tower and into hiding.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 3}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 535}} He confronted Stark, who quickly overrode his armor; however, Peter then overrode Stark's command and escaped.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 536}} In retaliation, [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] sent the pro-registration [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], a group of registered villains, after him.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 6}}

While running through the sewers, he is attacked by the [[Jody Putt (Earth-616)|Jester]] and [[Steven Levins (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern]]. They beat up Spider-Man, but before they can capture him, the Punisher killed them and brought Spider-Man to the [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] headquarters.{{r|Civil War Vol 1 5}} After joining the team and reuniting with his wife and aunt, Spider-Man interrupted a news broadcast, announcing his mistake of registering, giving his allegiance to the anti-registered and gives a description of the Negative Zone Prison.

Spider-Man was one of the few heroes who did not accept the general amnesty after the arrest and the [[Death of Captain America|death of Captain America]], continuing to work with the underground New Avengers.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 538}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 27}} Peter took Cap's death hard, even blaming himself for his death despite not being present at the shooting. After an encounter with [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]] and receiving condolence from [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], Spider-Man watched Cap's funeral on TV with the New Avengers; when the team discussed why they didn't go, he said they could not risk getting arrested by Tony Stark on the spot.{{r|Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America #1|5}}

===Back in Black===
Peter's now-public identity allowed the Kingpin to put a hit on Parker's family. His [[Jake Martino (Earth-616)|sniper]] shot at him at his apartment. Peter saved Mary Jane, but the bullet hit Aunt May.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #538}} He takes his aunt to a hospital where she falls into a coma.

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 539 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Back in Black]]
Tracking the sniper's gun to a warehouse full of arms dealers viciously beats everyone and gets the names of the dealers who traffics those guns. Peter donned a cloth version of his black suit to find those who were responsible for hurting his family. Getting the sniper’s name from the gun dealers, he tracked him and beat him but he was killed by another assassin. He found the gunman talking to Fisk on his cell phone. Peter takes him to a sewer pipe, beats him, and tells him to tell everyone to stay away from his family. He arrives at [[Ryker's Island]] during a prison riot lead by the Kingpin to confront him. Spider-Man savagely beat the crime-lord and taunts him on his lack of real powers.

Telling Fisk that after his aunt died, he would kill him; the then threatened the other inmates with a slow and painful death if they ever harmed his family before leaving.{{r|{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 539}}-[[Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 543|543]]}} Spider-Man also confronted Ero, who had been posing as a nurse in Midtown High “Miss Arrow” and captured Flash Thompson to use him to hatch her eggs. They begin to fight using their stingers but Ero manages to hit him in the shoulder, paralyzing him. She decides to place her eggs inside of him instead of Flash. Spider-Man was saved by Betty Brant, who shot the egg sac with a shotgun. Ero tried to escape but Spider-Man lured her into an aviary, where she was devoured by hundreds of birds. Spider-Man stepped on the last spider remaining.{{r|{{cl|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #20}}-[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #22|22]]}}

Realizing he could not afford for his identity to be public knowledge, Peter agreed to aid the [[Scarlet Spiders (Team Red) (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spiders]] in return for their help in re-establishing his secret identity. Telling the media that Parker was part of their team but was discharged and drawing confusion as to if Parker is the first and only Spider-Man.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #7}} Towards the end of his search, Peter even had an encounter with the [[One-Above-All (Multiverse)|One-Above-All]], who asked Peter to let his Aunt go, saying death it's a natural part of life.{{r|Sensational Spider-Man Vol 2 40}}

===One More Day===
Peter grew increasingly desperate to save the life of his Aunt May. He sought the help of Dr. Strange, finding that even magic could not help him save Aunt May's life. After appealing to Tony Stark, [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Jarvis]] was sent with $2 million to pay the hospital fees and give her the best care possible.

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 545 Textless.png|thumb|right|The missing piece of Peter and Mary Jane's life]]

At one point, Eddie Brock was found in Aunt May's room; where he attempted to commit suicide by jumping out of the window. The inter-dimensional [[Demons|Demon]] [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] offered to save Aunt May in exchange for Peter and MJ's love. As part of Mephisto's deal, everyone would forget Peter's identity as Spider-Man. Because of this decision, the daughter they would have had never existed.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #545}}

Then Mephisto re-arranged history to make it so that Peter unwittingly would not show up to his wedding day, but stayed with Mary Jane as a long time couple. But this re-arrangement also caused it to be Doctor Strange who erased people's memories about Parker's secret identity (except Mary Jane and some others) and protected Peter with a "psychic blindspot," preventing people from being able to consciously deduce that Peter Parker and Spider-Man were the same people unless anyone actually saw him take his mask off.

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 546 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Spider-Man starting a Brand New Day]]

But Mary Jane was bitterly hurt from having knowledge of a time of great emotional pain that no one else on the planet remembered. She and Peter agreed that they were still in love with each other but they had to accept that their relationship put everyone they cared about in danger and that it was best for them to remain as friends.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 545|546}} Back from years in a European rehab center was Harry Osborn.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 545}} While searching for a job, Peter joined the Daily Bugle again which was now bought out by [[Dexter Bennett (Earth-616)|Dexter Bennett]], and began to work as a paparazzi reporter, which was something that neither his Aunt May nor Harry approved of.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 548}}

However, after his photographs of the celebrity [[Robert Carr (Earth-616)|Bobby Carr]] resulted in the deaths of women by a crazed [[Piper Dali (Earth-616)|super villain stalker]] who was obsessed with him, Peter decided to destroy the new photos he took resulting in Bennett firing him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 560|561}} Peter soon learned that Bennett had blacklisted him to nearly every news source in town preventing Peter from finding work. However, Harry suggested that Peter find a job at a news source that was Bennett's enemy, which he did by joining the Front Line as it was not under Bennett's influence.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 561}}

===Dark Reign & American Son===
After the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], Norman Osborn, who had killed the [[Veranke (Earth-616)|Skrull Queen]] that posed as Spider-Woman in the final battle, was given Stark's position as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]]. He donned a [[Iron Patriot Armor Model 1|altered Iron Man armor]] with Captain America's color set a became known as the "[[Iron Patriot]]."

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 597 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Spider-Man fighting Norman's Dark Avengers]]
He dissolved S.H.I.E.L.D. and created [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] and his personal "[[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]," composed mainly of super-criminals who had served in the Thunderbolts posing as heroes. Since Osborn had transformed Venom into a more Spider-Man like look to join his Dark Avengers,{{r|Dark Avengers #1}}

Peter had to reveal his secret identity to the New Avengers, in order to implicitly earn the team's trust. Upon doing so, [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]] fled the place, as she had gone to high school with Peter and had a crush on him at the time.{{r|New Avengers #51}}

During a trip to the Macroverse, Spider-Man re-revealed to the Fantastic Four his identity, and after coming back, he discovered two months had passed in standard time. J.J. Jameson had become the new NY mayor, Aunt May and Jameson's father [[John Jonah Jameson, Sr. (Earth-616)|Jay]] were in a relationship, Harry had fallen to drink and [[Michele Gonzales (Earth-616)|Michele Gonzales]] had moved to his apartment. Then Spider-Man knew he must act against Norman Osborn and his [[Dark Reign]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #594}}

With help of the F4's [[Unstable Molecules]], Spider-Man infiltrated Osborn's Avengers as Venom and discovered how Osborn wanted to make his son a new hero called [[American Son]] and have him killed in action to increase his Avengers' popularity. After Spider-Man was captured by Norman Osborn, Harry confronted Osborn using the American Son Armor with the truth about his father's relationship with [[Lily Hollister (Earth-616)|Lily Hollister]] (Harry's girlfriend). Spider-Man prevented Harry from killing Norman.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #599}}

===The Grim Hunt===
After the wedding of Aunt May and Jay, Jonah's parent, Spider-Man saved Jameson from Doctor Octopus with the help of the Human Torch. Around this time Mary Jane returned to New York, and Peter renewed his relationship with Black Cat. He later battled a man who wanted to kill Ben Reilly and saw the return of Peter's living clone [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]]. Despite his problems, Spider-Man helped the original [[Sara Ehret (Earth-616)|Jackpot]] start fighting crime{{r|{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Presents: Jackpot Vol 1 1}}-[[Amazing Spider-Man Presents: Jackpot Vol 1 3|3]]}} and overcame the corrupting control of [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mister Negative]]'s energy.{{r|{{cl|Dark Reign: Mister Negative Vol 1 1}}-[[Dark Reign: Mister Negative Vol 1 3|3]]}}

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 606 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Peter with old flames]]

The Kravinoff family started a vengeance scheme on Spider-Man, kidnapping [[Cassandra Webb (Earth-616)|Madame Web]] and [[Martha Franklin (Earth-616)|Mattie Franklin]], one of the Spider-Women.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #611}} In addition, Spider-Man managed to get a videotape of Osborn practicing illegal experiments to damage his reputation and leaked it to the public.{{r|Dark Reign: The List - Spider-Man #1}}

Later, Spider-Man faced re-powered villains such as Electro, who destroyed the [[Daily Bugle Building|DB! Building]];{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 612|614}} Sandman, who became obsessed with taking care of his "daughter" [[Keemia Alvarado (Earth-616)|Keemia]];{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 615|616}} Rhino, who left reformation to kill a [[Rhino (Kraven) (Earth-616)|new Rhino]] who murdered his [[Oksana Sytsevich (Earth-616)|wife]];{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 625}} Mysterio, starting a gang war;{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 618|620}} a new [[James Natale (Earth-616)|Vulture]], who tried to kill Jameson;{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 623|624}} and the Lizard, who evolved and "killed" his alter-ego and his son [[William Connors (Earth-616)|Billy]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 630|633}} Many of them were helped by Kraven's wife [[Sasha Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Sasha]], who wanted revenge on Spider-Man, arranging most of these attacks so that Peter would be a potent sacrifice.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 634}}

The Kravinoffs killed Mattie Franklin to resurrect [[Vladimir Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Grim Hunter]], and finally hunted Spider-Man and killed him to revive Kraven. However, it was revealed that the corpse was Kaine's, who had earlier knocked out Peter and switched places to save him. After a battle with the Kravinoff family, Madame Web died and Julia Carpenter took up her mantle. The surviving Kravinoffs left New York. Later, Kaine was resurrected from his grave and mutated into a more spider-like creature by the Jackal.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 634|637}}

===Big Time===
After Osborn's fall and the Registration Act's abolition following the [[Siege (Event)|Siege of Asgard]], MJ invited Peter over so the two of them could gain closure over the marriage that didn't happen and the break-up.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #638|641}}

[[File: Marko Djurdjevic - Age of Heroes Spider-man Covers.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The world of Spider-Man.]]
Later, a massive war ensued between Doctor Octopus and Spider-Man to get Lily Hollister's and Norman Osborn's son, Spidey found that the [[Stanley Osborn (Earth-616)|child]] was actually Harry's,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #642|646}} who later leaves town to raise him. Peter then finally starts a relationship with police officer [[Carlie Cooper (Earth-616)|Carlie Cooper]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #647}}

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 664 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Spidey, Wraith and Anti-Venom vs. Mister Negative's henchman]]
Spider-Man's heroic career rose up again, he joined the reassembled Avengers and also stayed with the New Avengers, who were outlaws no more. He learned that Michele was moving and he couldn't maintain his apartment anymore. However, Peter found a dream job, thanks to Jameson's wife [[Marla Madison (Earth-616)|Marla Madison]], as compensation for Jameson firing him, as a scientist at [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon Labs]] where he had access to much technology and resources while also giving him the freedom to come and go as he liked so long as he delivered good results. Spider-Man assisted the Avengers in defeating Doctor Octopus' army of macro-Octobots. He then faced a new [[Phillip Urich (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]] and the Kingpin, but days later, he lamentably lost Marla in a fight between [[Alistaire Smythe (Earth-616)|Alistair Smythe]]'s Spider-Slayers.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #648|654}}

[[File:Future Foundation.jpg|thumb|right|Spidey with the rest of the FF]]
After Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) died preventing an invasion from the [[Negative Zone]], Peter joined the Fantastic Four, now as the [[Future Foundation (Earth-616)|Future Foundation]] as Johnny's last request to him and helped them to fight an interdimensional version of Reed Richards, and the Sinister Six, who managed to steal tech from the Baxter Building. Their third mission was in the Caribbean, on Earth. There, Reed located the epicenter of the dimensional anomalies the Future Foundation had been fixing. As the team explored the island, they were attacked by zombie pirates. It was revealed it was all a fake created by the Sinister Six, with only Mysterio and Chameleon really present, the other four members were robots. Meanwhile, Doctor Octopus and the others infiltrated the Baxter Building, stealing technology for Doc Ock's further plans.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #657|660}}

===Spider-Island===
After helping Anti-Venom (Eddie Brock) to reveal Mr. Negative's identity{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #663|664}} (as well as learning that Aunt May was moving to [[Boston]] with Jay) Spider-Man found himself with a new problem: the Jackal returned and gave the majority of New Yorkers spider-powers.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Infested #1}} The Queen was revealed as the true mastermind: she wanted to turn the whole human race into spiders. Mr. Fantastic created a cure using the [[Anti-Venom Symbiote (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom Symbiote]], and after battling Peter (under Jackal's influence), Peter's clone Kaine was accidentally cured of his mutations, turning him into a perfect clone.

[[File:Peter Parker (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 670 001.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Spiders, spiders everywhere.]]
While he and the Avengers battled the Spider-Queen in [[Central Park]], Kaine killed her and Peter managed to get the cure to every citizen via Doc Ock's (mentally controlled) Octobots. He met with Jay and May while they were leaving for Boston. Peter then ran into Kaine, who told Peter that he was leaving New York and would Peter's stealth suit since Madame Web told Kaine he may need it. Also, because of revealing he had spider-powers during the Spider-Island incident, Peter's psychic blind spot was weakened, letting Carlie know he was Spider-Man, which caused her to break up with him. Before giving the last cure sample to MJ, who briefly attempted to keep some spider-powers, Spidey met with Madame Web on the roof of Horizon Labs. She told him that he could de-power himself with the cured sample and someone else will step in to take his place.

Peter refuses, saying that throwing his gift away would be the most irresponsible thing he's ever done. Madame Web warns that he is to suffer [[Dying Wish|a loss]]. He then cures MJ and they look at the [[Empire State Building]], lit in red and blue in his honor.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #666|673}}

===Ends of the Earth===

After every Avenger was eventually subdued by Octavius,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #683}} Silver Sable, who followed Spider-Man to his battle, saved him and [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]]. Octavius asked for help from all nations to capture Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #684}} Octavius called on many villains to hunt down Spider-Man and his allies. To counter this, Spider-Man called on the heroes that were still on Earth to destroy the facilities of Octavius.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth #1}} After most of the Sinister Six are defeated, Mysterio is convinced by Spider-Man to help him catch the Octopus in his base in [[Guatemala]], but Octavius used the mind-controlled Avengers as his new Sinister Six.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #686}}

Spider-Man, Sable, and Widow managed to defeat the Avengers, then he and Sable headed to Octavius's underwater base. They were faced by Rhino while the base started to flood, he trapped Sable and left Spider-Man with two choices, to continue to fight him in order to save Sable from drowning, but Octavius would activate the lenses or let him drown himself and Sable to stop Octavius. After leaving Sable to her death at her request, Spidey managed to destroy Octavius's arms and equipment before taking his foe away to a doctor, thus finally saving the world.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #687}} Peter again was distraught over the death of Silver Sable, as he felt that he could have saved her.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #8}} Julia Carpenter, however, later told him that Sable was still alive.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #690}}

===Spider-Men: Heroes of Two Worlds===
While fighting Mysterio, Spider-Man was accidentally sent through a dimensional rift in the villain's possession into [[Earth-1610]], the Ultimate Universe, where he encountered the Spider-Man of that world, [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Miles Morales]], who had taken up the mantle of the late [[Peter Parker (Earth-1610)|Peter Parker]] from his universe.{{r|Spider-Men Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Spider-Men Vol 1 5 Pichelli Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Spider-Man and the Ultimates]]
Once Miles and S.H.I.E.L.D. made sense of Spider-Man's appearance, they joined forces to fight Mysterio and the robotic avatar he used to operate on Earth-1610.{{r|Spider-Men Vol 1 2}} Peter eventually couldn't resist learning more about the life of his counterpart, and visited the home of the [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-1610)|May Parker]] and [[Gwendolyne Stacy (Clone) (Earth-1610)|Gwen Stacy]] from this reality.{{r|Spider-Men Vol 1 3}}

May had a particularly tearful reunion with the image of what her nephew could've been, which was cut short when both Spider-Men were called by S.H.I.E.L.D. to deal with Mysterio. Once Mysterio's base was located, the Spider-Men attacked him with assistance from the [[Ultimates (Earth-1610)|Ultimates]] and S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Spider-Men Vol 1 4}}

Before Mysterio's portal closed permanently due to malfunctions, Peter gave Miles his blessing as the new Spider-Man and returned to his reality. Later, Peter went online to search to see if his world had a Miles Morales counterpart and was shocked by what he discovered.{{r|Spider-Men Vol 1 5}}

===Superior Spider-Man===
In the middle of a fight against the Hobgoblin, while his spider-sense was overloaded, Spider-Man was unsuspectedly pinched by one of Doctor Octopus' Octobots programmed to swap consciousness between the two, causing Peter to become trapped in the dying body of his foe while Octavius claimed Peter's life for himself. In an attempt to take back his life with the little time he had left, Peter broke out of Octavius's cell in the Raft{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 699}} leading to a final confrontation between the two in the [[Stark Tower (Columbus Circle, Rebuilt)|Avengers Tower]].

[[File: Otto Octavius (Earth-616) and Peter Parker (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 700 0001.jpg|thumb|right|The apparent death of Peter in Doctor Octopus' body]]
Though Peter failed to reverse the change, he managed to establish a weak link with Otto's mind using an Octobot. In his final moments, Peter forced Otto to relive all of his memories. Having experienced in a flash all of Peter's trials and tribulations, Otto learned his lesson of power and responsibility and swore to carry on with Peter's life with dignity as a superior Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 700}}

Since Peter was mentally connected to Otto when his body perished, a portion of himself survived in his original body, but in the form of a subconsciousness, thus not able to control the actions of his body entirely.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 1}}

Even though Otto attempted to rid of this remnant of Parker,{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 9}} he decided to seek its help sometime later after being overwhelmed by the returned Green Goblin and his [[Goblin Nation (Earth-616)|Goblin Nation]]. Realizing that he failed in his role as the "superior" Spider-Man, having pushed his allies aside and lost his resources in the process, Otto willingly allowed Peter to reclaim his body in order to defeat Osborn once and for all and save [[Anna Maria Marconi (Earth-616)|Anna Maria Marconi]], Otto's love.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 27.NOW|30}}

In the aftermath of Otto's possession of his body, Peter began to amend the relationships damaged by Otto's arrogance and negligence, both as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He additionally took up the reins of [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]], a small company founded by Octavius after leaving Horizon Labs.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 31}}

===Spider-Verse===
While adjusting to his new status quo, especially his position as the CEO of his very own company,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 1}} Peter learned of the existence of [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Cindy Moon]], a second person to have been bit by the same radioactive spider which granted Peter his powers. Spider-Man tracked her down and freed her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms, where Cindy had spent over a decade in voluntary confinement shortly after getting her powers, in order to avoid drawing attention. While Peter notified Cindy that Morlun was dead, he had, in fact, survived his last encounter against Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 4}}

Not long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt her own superheroic identity as [[Silk]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 5}} Spider-Man was approached by a contingent of spider-people from all over the [[Multiverse]] that banded together to fight the [[Inheritors (Earth-001)|Inheritors]], a group of psychic vampires and family of Morlun that had begun to hunt down the [[:Category: Spider-Totems|spider-totems]] of other realities.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 9}} During a mission to gather more recruits in [[Earth-928|2099 A.D.]], the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by Otto Octavius, or rather a version of him from the recent past who had been plucked out of time.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 10}}

[[File: Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 13 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Peter leading the Spider-Army]]
The combined Spider-Army were forced to retreat to [[Earth-3145]] after their safe zone in [[Earth-13]] had been compromised by the Inheritors, namely Morlun, his brother [[Jennix (Earth-001)|Jennix]], and his father and leader of the Inheritors, [[Solus (Earth-001)|Solus]].{{r|{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 11}}-[[Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 12|12]]}} With the help of [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]], who had previously infiltrated the Inheritor's base on [[Earth-001]], the Spider-Army learned of a prophecy in which the Inheritors planned to sacrifice three key spiders: the Other, the Bride, and the Scion. These individuals were [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine Parker]], Cindy Moon, and [[Benjamin Richard Parker (Earth-982)|Benjy Parker]] of [[Earth-982]], respectively.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 13}}

With the help of even more recruits from other realities and even a deviant Inheritor named [[Karn (Earth-001)|Karn]], the Spider-Army, including a version of Gwen Stacy with spider-powers known as "[[Gwendolyn Stacy (Earth-65)|Spider-Gwen]]," launched one final attack on the Inheritors' home of [[Earth-001]]. The ritual was stopped, and the Inheritors were exiled with no means to return home to the radioactive wasteland that had become the world of Earth-3145.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 14}}

With the Inheritors neutralized, most of the spider-totems were sent home. Spider-Man and a few others stayed on Earth-001 for a little while longer to defeat the time-displaced Octavius, who had gone rogue after learning that Parker would eventually regain control of his body. Octavius was defeated and returned to the time he had come from, losing the memory of the recent events in the process. With no more problems to confront, Spider-Man and the rest of the spiders were sent back home.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 15}}

===Rise and Fall of Parker Industries===
Unbeknownst to anyone, Otto Octavius had created a digital back-up of his own mind which ended up inhabiting the metallic body of Parker Industries' robotic assistant, the [[Living Brain (Earth-616)|Living Brain]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 18}} Over the course of the following months, Octavius routinely hacked into the systems of the market share to manipulate its numbers in the favor of Parker Industries.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 29}}

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Spider-Man gone global]]
As a consequence of this, the company managed to expand into a global conglomerate with numerous bases in different countries, with the company's trademark invention being a mobile device called the [[Webware]]. This change in Peter's life impacted his superheroic alter ego as well. Spider-Man officially became the mascot of Parker Industries under the guise of being Peter's bodyguard.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 1}}

One of Peter's biggest challenges during his tenure as a billionaire C.E.O was the emergence of a mysterious biotech company, operating out of the [[Transamerica Pyramid]], called [[New U Technologies (Earth-616)|New U]]. Peter discovered it was a front for the operations of the Jackal, who claimed to have found a way to bring people back from the dead using cloning technology. In an attempt to persuade Peter to put Parker Industries' resources to help his plan, the Jackal resurrected numerous of his late friends and foes, including Gwen Stacy.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 1}} In a turn of events, the Jackal was revealed to be Ben Reilly,{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 3}} who had been brought to life by the original Jackal before taking his place.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 22}}

The Jackal's plan eventually fell apart following the triggering of cellular decay in the clones created by New U, which led to the release of the [[Carrion Virus]] worldwide.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 4}} The crisis was adverted when Spider-Man had his Webware transmit an audio frequency in a global scale which halted the cellular degeneration but not before most of the clones died.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 5}} The Jackal, is a clone himself, was left for dead, though he secretly escaped and returned to the mantle of the Scarlet Spider.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 1}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 24}}

Afterward, Peter teamed-up again with [[Teresa Parker (Earth-616)|Teresa Durand]], a CIA agent with whom Peter had already joined forces in a mission at least a year ago during which she was seemingly brainwashed by the Kingpin and [[Marvin Flumm (Earth-616)|Mentallo]] to believe she was Peter's long-lost sister.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Family Business Vol 1 1}} Teresa sought Peter's help when on the run from a government organization called the [[Gray Blade (Earth-616)|Gray Blade]].{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 2}}

[[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s [[Secret Empire (Event)|take-over of the United States of America]] temporarily put a halt to Peter and Teresa's escapades. Numerous headquarters of Parker Industries around the globe were then targeted by the forces of the terrorist organization,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 29}} namely a unit led by one of Hydra's latest additions, the duplicate of Doctor Octopus, who had gained a physical body through the Jackal's cloning technology.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 25}}

In a last-ditch effort to prevent the resources of Parker Industries from falling in the hands of Octavius and Hydra, Parker had his employees obliterate all systems of the company, running Parker Industries into the ground.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 31}} He later fought alongside the rest of America's superheroes that assembled in [[Washington, D.C.]] to retake the United States from Hydra's control.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}}

[[File:Peter Parker The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 302 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Spider-Man battles Green Goblin alongside his alternate past self]]
Despite having his civilian reputation smeared due to his company's collapse, Peter quickly got back on his feet. After beginning a short-lived relationship with Parker Industries' former S.H.I.E.L.D. liaison [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]], Peter was hired by Robbie Robertson as the editor for the Daily Bugle's science section.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 #789|791}}

Before Peter recovered himself, however, his adventure with Teresa continued, who discovered that she truly was Mary and Richard Parker's daughter,{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 304}} and shared this information with Peter.{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 303}}

[[File: Conan the Barbarian Vol 3 4 Spider-Man Villains Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Rise of the Red Goblin]]
Not long after Peter had decided to reveal his secret identity to Jameson,{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 6}} Jonah was kidnapped by Norman Osborn, and accidentally let it slip that Peter was Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 797}} In addition to having regained his powers, Osborn had bonded with the [[Carnage (Symbiote)|Carnage Symbiote]], giving birth to the Red Goblin.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 798}}

Peter failed to take down Osborn despite the help from his allies,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 799}} and was overpowered in battle even after Eddie Brock had lent him his symbiote. Peter only managed to defeat Osborn in a fight after tricking him into rejecting the symbiote, having claimed that any credit for his defeat would go to the Carnage symbiote and not Osborn himself. Unfortunately, the process of defeating Osborn cost the life of Spider-Man's biggest fan, Flash Thompson, who had recently become the superhero [[Anti-Venom|Agent Anti-Venom]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800}}

===Kindred Saga===
[[File:Peter Parker (Earth-616) and Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Peter and Mary Jane, together again]]
As the new mayor of New York City, the Kingpin started a campaign of public acceptance of Spider-Man to isolate him from his super hero peers. In his civilian identity, Peter was accused of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation from Octavius and, unable to defend himself without exposing his secret identity, Peter was stripped of his credentials and was fired from the Daily Bugle as well as a result.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 1}} Receiving a re-enrollment recommendation by Dr. Connors at Empire State University to earn his college degree, Peter also started sharing an apartment with Randy Robertson again, but they were joined by a third roommate in the form of Frederick Myers, the super villain Boomerang{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2018 Amazing Spider-Man}}, who struck up a tenuous friendship with Peter.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 6|7}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 41|43}} As these events unfolded, Peter was unaware of becoming the target of fixation of a demonic entity dubbed "Kindred",{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 24}} consumed by the belief that Peter had to repent for his sins and the misery he brought on his loved ones. Although Peter had rekindled his relationship with Mary Jane, Kindred would use Mysterio to give her an acting opportunity out west for some months,{{r|Amazing Mary Jane Vol 1}} while appearing in nebulous nightmares to psychologically torture Peter.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 25|29}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 44|45}}

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 45 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Spider-Man vs The Sin-Eater]]
With Kraven's return for a great hunt, Spider-Man was trapped by the hunter in Central Park alongside animal-themed villains.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 16}} Visions of Mary Jane's death spurred Peter on to save all remaining captives with aid from the Black Cat, returning home to find Mary Jane safe.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 23}} As Morlun returned seeking to finish Peter off, J. Jonah Jameson enlisted the NYPD to help in the Inheritor's capture{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 311|313}} before aiding the Spider-Army against the returned Inheritors.{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 5}} Peter subsequently became tangled helping Venom against the resurgent Carnage, herald of the Symbiote God [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]. His involvement was protecting Brock's son [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan]] and Normie Osborn from the released Norman Osborn, who still believed himself to be Cletus Kasady and was bonded to a Carnage symbiote copy by the real Kasady as a pawn.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}} When Spider-Man was victorious in defeating Norman/Carnage, he was ignorant of [[Sarah Stacy (Earth-616)|Kindred]]'s giving him the opening shot to win.{{r|{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 #30}}-[[Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 #31|31]]}} When [[Sarah Stacy (Earth-616)|Kindred]] resurrected [[Stanley Carter (Earth-616)|Stanley Carter]], the Sin-Eater, the demon sent him on a campaign of vicious vigilantism, with the new ability to strip both the powers and wickedness from super villains, leaving them deeply repentant.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 37|39}} As Carter targeted the restored Norman Osborn, made director of the [[Ravencroft Institute]]. A conflicted Peter chose to save Norman, who became the Green Goblin again to fight alongside him against the Sin-Eater.

[[File:Gabriel Stacy (Earth-616) and Peter Parker (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 54 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Kindred pretending to be Harry]]
Norman attempted to kill Peter at the last moment, but [[Order of the Web (Earth-616)|The Order of the Web]] intervened and helped them escape. With Norman further acting out of line, Peter finally snapped and left him behind at the Sin-Eater's mercy, who purified Osborn.{{r|{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 45}}-[[Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 49|49]]}} [[Gabriel Stacy (Earth-616)|Kindred]] transferred the collected sins and thrusted them into the Order, turning them into rampaging monsters. Seeking Doctor Strange's aid, Spider-Man used a magical item to find Kindred's base, where the demon ''revealed'' himself as Harry Osborn. Kindred tortured Peter, who traded his life for the Order's freedom, with repeated killing and resurrections{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 50|53}} then had a returned Mary Jane join their reunion. Norman, purged of his wickedness, disclosed Kindred's identity to her, and she managed to distract Kindred long enough for Norman and the Kingpin to successfully enact a plan that restrained Kindred in a cage of [[Darkforce]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 54|55}} Free but traumatized, Peter was given an improvised therapy session by Mary Jane on a closed stage which restored some hope in himself.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 60}}

[[File:Sinister War Vol 1 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Spider-Man and the Sinister War]] 
For a brief time, Spider-Man accepted a work offer{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 40}} at Jameson's news outlet, [[Threats and Menaces (Earth-616)|TNM]], gaining a new suit that enhanced his abilities and broadcasted his crime-fighting activities. With it, Spider-Man and Boomerang finished a long-running quest to reassemble the Lifeline Tablet fragments{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 41|43}} scattered over New York{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 61|65}}. However, Myers eventually revealed his friendship with Peter to have been a long con to get Spider-Man's help, and handed over the Tablet to Fisk to resurrect his son, [[Richard Fisk (Earth-616)|The Rose]].{{r|Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: King's Ransom Vol 1 1}} Immediately after, Peter had to help Betty stop a scheme involving the Foreigner with help from Ned, somehow alive despite witnessing his death{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 15}}. The investigation resulted in saving his classmate [[Jamie Tolentino (Earth-616)|Jaime]] and handing over the coveted [[Clairvoyant (Item)|Clairvoyant]] over to his sister, Teresa{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 66|69}}{{r|Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: Chameleon Conspiracy Vol 1 1}}. After escaping custody, [[Gabriel Stacy (Earth-616)|Kindred]] forced Doctor Octopus to reassemble the Sinister Six{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 70}} to kidnap Spider-Man and Mary Jane{{r|Sinister War Vol 1 1}}. Forced into a battle royale against various super villain teams under Kindred's influence vying to kill him, Boomerang sacrificed himself to save Spider-Man from Morlun's grasp, and the conflict ended with the villains all incapacitated by Doctor Octopus in a bid to free himself from Kindred's influence.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 71|73}}{{r|{{cl|Sinister War Vol 1 2}}-[[Sinister War Vol 1 4|4]]}}

[[File:Peter Parker (Earth-616), Gabriel Stacy (Earth-616) and Sarah Stacy (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 74 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Kindred no more]]
Returning to Kindred's lair, Spider-Man was spirited away to Mary Jane's location in Paris{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 71|73}}{{r|{{cl|Sinister War Vol 1 2}}-[[Sinister War Vol 1 4|4]]}}, where Norman warned him that Sarah and Gabriel were both Kindred. Harry soon arrived to aid Peter, and revealed that the twins were vessels made by the Osborn AI, a digital copy of Harry's evil mind from his Green Goblin days. With Harry dead amid the battle, Spider-Man was later buried in the collapsed building too fatigued to escape, but rescued by Mary Jane. With Peter alive, the twins were useless to Mephisto and immediately died from their unstable biology resuming. As Peter lamented Harry's death before heading home with Mary Jane, the two then shared a peaceful kiss atop the Empire State Building, freed of Kindred's haunting.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 74}}

===Beyond===
Although Peter attempted to return to his normal life, he remained traumatized by Harry's death, which affected his grades. When the Beyond Corporation bought the Spider-Man trademark for privatized super heroism, they enlisted Ben Reilly as their own wall-crawler. Unable to legally stop it, Peter joined forces with Ben in a fight against the U-Foes, in which Peter suffered a near-fatal radiation exposure. After Ben delivered Peter to the hospital, Peter gave his blessing to Ben to continue as Spider-Man, before his body began to shut down and slipped into a coma, forcing Aunt May to seek help.{{r|{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 75}}-[[Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 77|77]]}}

| Personality             = {{Quote|Whether a law is right or wrong, moral or immoral, is an idea, a personal philosophy... but it always seems that fights over '''ideas''' skip over the barrier into the real world and become battles of real violence.|Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 538}}

Spider-Man is commonly seen as a brave and righteous hero with an indomitable sense of justice and responsibility. Shaken by his uncle's tragic death, Spider-Man's vow of responsibility has led him to a path of heroism and humanitarian service. There are times when Spider-Man's sense of responsibility can be almost overbearing; this was evidently noted by [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] when he felt embarrassed about [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]] causing the [[Raft]] breakout, despite the fact he had nothing to do with it.{{r|New Avengers #3}} This combined with his strong moral compass in the face of adversity and sharp wit makes him one of the most iconic and enduring heroes in the [[Earth-616|Marvel Universe]].

One of Spider-Man's most prominent traits is his sense of humor. He at times is seen as the class clown in every group he is in. Even in the face of certain death, Spider-Man invariably cracks a joke, to the annoyance of both friends and foes. His reasons for this vary: either he wants to relieve the stress of a situation, or simply because he wants to hide how scared he really is during a crisis. Also, he does this to get on the nerves of his opponents, since he knows that if they are angry, that they would normally lose themselves and be vulnerable to a superior skilled opponent. It is generally agreed, however, that whenever a life is in danger, he will stop telling jokes and take the current situation with the utmost seriousness.{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #1}}

Behind this humorous facade, however, is a wounded soul that has gone through much suffering. While Spider-Man is in combat, occasionally another person dies, leaving him depressed for having failed in his responsibility. Guilt over the loss of his Uncle Ben continues to be the primary motivating factor in his super-heroics and his life in general. Peter is quick to assume guilt and responsibility for anything bad that happens in his presence or that can, in some way, relate back to him. For instance, he assumed responsibility for Electro's mass breakout at the Raft{{r|New Avengers #4}} and Norman Osborn's Initiative{{r|New Avengers #48|50}} because they were "his" villains.

Death, in particular, is difficult for Peter to reconcile with, leading him to make dramatic and unrealistic proclamations, such as his "Nobody dies!" credo after Marla Madison's passing.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #655}} Peter has developed post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly related to Norman Osborn's murder of Gwen Stacy and Flash Thompson,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 49}} which was exacerbated by [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Kindred]] repeatedly killing and resurrecting him.{{r|{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 56}}-[[Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 57|57]]}} Peter also deeply hates symbiotes and blames himself for everyone who has died at the hands of [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom]], [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage]], and other symbiotes due to having brought the Venom symbiote to Earth.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 4}}

Spider-Man is also traditionally a loner. Due to his individualistic style, having been a social outcast in his youth, Spider-Man finds it hard to work in teams. However, this has gradually lessened over the years, to the point Spider-Man has worked actively with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Avengers Vol 7 1}}

Peter is also a strong-willed hero, whatever obstacles that come his way, if it's relationships, being misunderstood, or someone dying in his watch, he always gets back up. His indomitable will and don't give up attitude usually pushed him to do amazing feats like supporting the weight of a jet{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #694}} and beating up [[Pyreus Kril (Earth-616)|Firelord]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #270}} Despite being a hero, Spider-Man is nerdy, awkward, and shy. These traits have faded through the years as Parker grew up and gained confidence, but elements of the awkward teenage nerd still remain in his personality.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #5}}

Spider-Man's righteousness complimented [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]]'s maturity as a crime-fighter during the [[The Death of Jean DeWolff]], leading to an enduring friendship.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #107|110}} Peter also made close ties with the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] at the very start of his career, which stands greater than ever today, like a family rendering aid to each other unconditionally.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #590}} Spider-Man has bonded with the New Avengers of whom he is a founding member, trusting them so much that he would reveal his identity to them.{{r|New Avengers #51}} Of the two previously mentioned teams, Spidey is closest to the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]], playing pranks on one another or seeking solace respectively,{{r|{{cl|Spider-Man Human Torch #1}}-[[Spider-Man Human Torch #5|5]]}} and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], respectively.{{r|Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine #1|6}} Peter is also quite close to the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], able to sympathize with the public scorn that [[Homo Superior|mutants]] often face,{{r|X-Men #35}} and once joining their faculty - though he was quick to call them out on being prejudicial against non-mutants.{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men Vol 1 1}} Spider-Man has also developed a strong friendship with [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]],{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 9}} despite annoying each other with their morals and jokes.

===Reputation===
{{Quote|[[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|Jonah]] only goes after me because he loves [[New York City|this city]]. He genuinely believes [[Spider-Man]] is a menace to society. Always has. Look, I'm not saying you have to like everybody you meet. Or that you can't get mad at people when they screw up. Just that it might be worth a minute to try and see things from the other guy's side. Turns out most people--even the grumpy ones who yell--probably don't deserve blunt force trauma on the head.| Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|AXIS: Revolutions Vol 1 1}}

Seen by some as the heart of [[New York City|New York]], Peter has gained quite a reputation with not only the superhero community but villains and civilians as well: his [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|Aunt May]] searched the Internet and found that Spider-Man had saved roughly 10,000 lives directly, excluding all of his team-ups with other heroes and all the bombs or devices he's deactivated.{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #12}} In the [[Bar with No Name]], the villains present initially felt discouraged to bet money against the Wall-Crawler as he fought [[James Beverley (Earth-616)|Overdrive]] since "He always beats the new guys."{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2007 Spider-Man}}

When the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]] began his criminal career and was almost killed by the [[Frank Schlichting (Earth-616)|Constrictor]], the Constrictor noted how new he was to villainy and that he "didn't even get to fight Spider-Man."{{r|Hood #5}} Despite all the grudges Spider-Man has accumulated, he has made peace with some former enemies such as the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] (now an uneasy ally), [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]], [[Mark Raxton (Earth-616)|Molten Man]], [[Robert Farrell (Earth-616)|Rocket Racer]], [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]] (now known as Scarlet Spider), and even checked up on the less than lethal [[Vincent Patilio (Earth-616)|Frog Man]] after his incarceration ended to make sure things were fine.{{r|Spider-Man's Tangled Web #12}}

In spite of his many heroics, Spider-Man is infamous for numerous smear campaigns against him, especially at the hands of the ''[[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Daily Bugle]]''. The reason of this bad-mouthing upon him is because of the Bugle's manager and main publisher, [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|John Jonah Jameson]] had strong distrust towards the wall-crawler due to being a costumed vigilante with no affiliation to law and to take the spotlight of "true" heroes like public servants.

It was also revealed that Spider-Man is disliked by a good deal of [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|police]] in New York because, even though he comes to turn in captured supervillains, the police mistrust him due to his vigilantism, and they are also embarrassed over their dependency on him to arrest the threats they couldn't handle. However, it is also shown that some of the NYPD do support him, such as his good friends, Jean DeWolfe and George Stacy, and in later years, Lieutenant William Lamont.

In some cops, this dislike grew into hatred and they had tried to incriminate the Wall-Crawler by putting some of his trackers on recent corpses to turn public opinion against him. However, [[Vincent Gonzales (Earth-616)|Vin Gonzales]] (one of the involved cops) revealed the scheme for a lighter sentence and they earned the anger of the general public that the police ironically tried to frame Spider-Man with the crime.

During a fight with [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], Cable noted that Spider-Man is seen in the future as the greatest hero of them all.{{r|Avengers: X-Sanction #4}} Also, after Spider-Man helped the villain [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] to save [[Tess Black (Earth-616)|his daughter]] from [[Morwen (Earth-616)|Morwen]], one earned the other grudging but genuine respect.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #504}}

When [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] tried to become a better Spider-Man than Parker after switching bodies,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #700}} he failed to stop the Green Goblin's take over of Manhattan and admitted that Parker was the actual "Superior Spider-Man."{{r|Superior Spider-Man #30}}

===Relationships===
Peter's love interests include [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Felicia Hardy (Black Cat)]], [[Gwendolyne Stacy (Earth-616)|Gwen Stacy]], [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]], [[Elizabeth Brant (Earth-616)|Betty Brant]], [[Carlie Cooper (Earth-616)|Carlie Cooper]], [[Michele Gonzales (Earth-616)|Michele Gonzales]], [[Elizabeth Allan (Earth-616)|Liz Allan]], [[Debra Whitman (Earth-616)|Debra Whitman]], [[Priscilla Ironwood (Earth-616)|Cissy Ironwood]], [[Sara Bailey (Earth-616)|Sara Bailey]], [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silvija Sablinova (Silver Sable)]], [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow)]], [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol Danvers (Ms. Marvel, Captain Marvel)]], [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Julia Carpenter (Spider-Woman, Arachne, Madame Web)]], [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Cindy Moon (Silk)]], [[Lian Tang (Earth-616)|Lian Tang]] and [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Bobbi Morse (Mockingbird)]]. However, Mary Jane Watson has been the only woman he had married before [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] altered reality.

===Religious Views===
Peter Parker was recruited by [[Goddess (Earth-616)|Goddess]] as a member of her group of religious heroes,{{r|Infinity Crusade Vol 1 1}} and has expressed Protestant Christian beliefs in the past,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 35}} and allegedly attended sermons.{{r|Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 1}} This may in part be attributed to his Aunt May, who has always been a devout Protestant Christian.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #500}}{{r|Spider-Man: Blue #1}} He was since shown to hold firm atheist beliefs after renouncing his religion at an unknown time;{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 1.3}} however, things culminated in the appearance of the apparition of his Uncle Ben from the afterlife, and subsequently the [[Santerians (Earth-616)|Santerians]] urged Peter to resolve his crisis of faith, the first step of which was a visit to the confessional at [[Saint Patrick's Cathedral]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 1.6}}

'''Spider Physiology:''' Spider-Man possesses the proportionate powers of a spider, granted to him from an irradiated Common House Spider (''Achaearanea tepidariorum'') which bit Peter Parker that was apparently already mutated from prior exposure to certain frequencies of radiation and received a final, lethal dose during Parker's attendance of the exhibition.{{r|Amazing Fantasy #15}} The radioactive, complex mutagenic enzymes in the spider's blood that were transferred at the time of the bite triggered numerous body-wide mutagenic changes within Parker, granting him superhuman strength, speed, toughened flesh, and numerous arachnid-like abilities.{{r|Amazing Fantasy #15}} That mutation granted him an "enhanced chromosome pattern."{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 8}}

[[Ezekiel Sims (Earth-616)|Ezekiel Sims]] revealed to Peter that his powers were not of scientific origin, but were a sign that he had become a totemic avatar of the [[Web of Life and Destiny]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 30}} While Peter initially struggled to accept this, he later came to the conclusion that both were plausible,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #508}} and has had his powers mystically augmented on a number of occasions.

[[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]'s intel classified him as power level 8.{{r|Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury #1}}

His powers include:

*'''Wall-Crawling:''' Spider-Man's exposure to the mutated spider venom induced a mutagenic, cerebellum-wide alteration of his engrams resulting in the ability to mentally control the flux of interatomic attraction (electrostatic force) between molecular boundary layers. This overcomes the outer electron shell's normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail. The mentally controlled sub-atomic particle responsible for this has yet to be identified. This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to Spider-Man's body (especially concentrated in his hands and feet) and another object,{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 26}} with an upper limit of several tons per finger. At one point, Spider-Man was able to prevent Anti-Venom from taking his mask off by making it stick to his face.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 663}}
**'''Mark of Kaine:''' [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]], the relatively amoral clone of Spider-Man, has shown the ability to use his wall-crawling abilities in a more offensive manner, burning distinctive scars, known as the ''Mark of Kaine'' in the face of his victims. Later Spider-Man himself used a variation of the same ability to escape from the [[Green Goblin]] by making his fingertips cling to his face and tearing them away, digging five deep wounds in Norman's face.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #598}} Despite the obvious offensive potential of such an ability, Peter claims that it is unlikely he will use it again, as it was a move born out of anger and desperation.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #598}} In later events during the Grim Hunt arc, due to Peter's rage at Sasha Kravinoff over everything she put him and his 'spider family' through, he used his version of the Mark of Kaine on her, ripping the skin off her face in the shape of a handprint, proclaiming "My brother wanted to give you this."{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #637}} He has also been able to use the Mark of Kaine to rip Iron Man's armor off, piece by piece.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Who Am I? #1}} Limits to this ability seem to be psychosomatic, and the full nature of this ability has yet to be established.

*'''[[Superhuman Strength]]:''' Spider-Man possesses superhuman strength enabling him to press lift many tons. He was shown to easily swing a 3-ton wrecking ball using steel chains.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #230}} Spider-Man's physical strength is sufficient enough to enable him to lift and throw objects as heavy as a big rig semi-truck with ease,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #36}} and land a jet he estimated had a landing weight between 175,000-215,000 pounds.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #694}} He must also pull his punches and kicks unless fighting someone of similar or greater physical durability. Otherwise, his blows would prove fatal to a normal human being.{{r|Spider-Man Versus Wolverine #1}} He has demonstrated that he is strong enough to knock out people with normal durability with as little as a tap to the head. As such, he rarely lets himself use all of his strength - after Doctor Octopus had taken over Spider-Man's body, he easily punched off the Scorpion's (a foe normally regarded as physically tougher than Spider-Man) jaw as he hadn't known of Spider-Man's true strength.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #700}} Spider-Man's physical strength also extends into his legs, enabling him to be able to jump to a height of several stories in a single bound.{{r|Spider-Man #26}} Spider-Man demonstrated this when he leaped over thirty feet vertically into the air when he first leaped out of the way of an oncoming car; it should also be noted that when he first discovered his powers as a teenager, they had not developed to that of his prime.

*'''[[Superhuman Speed]]:''' Spider-Man is capable of running and moving at speeds that are far beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.{{r|Spider-Man: Back in Black Handbook #1}} Spider-Man is fast enough to catch up to an accelerating car while on foot, but prefers to travel by webs.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #267}} Spider-Man moves faster than the eye can follow;{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #185}}{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 211}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #248}} he has even moved so fast he appears as a blur.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 3 6}} Spider-Man was able to easily outrun multiple [[War Goblins (Earth-616)|goblin masquerade]] on [[Goblin Glider|goblin gliders]], and outmaneuver their ranged attacks at the same time.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 4}} In close combat, he was even able to dodge an all-out assault from Blurr (Jeffrey Walters) for an extended period of time.{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 4 11}}

*'''[[Superhuman Stamina]]:''' Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him. At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself at his peak capacity for several hours before the build-up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him. Several accounts depict Spider-Man as able to hold his breath for eight minutes or more.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #6}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 1}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #29}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 33}}

*'''[[Superhuman Durability]]:''' Spider-Man's body is physically tougher and more resistant to some types of injury than the body of a normal human. His body is more resistant to impact forces than anything else. He can withstand great impacts, such as falling from a height of several stories or being struck by an opponent with super strength. Events which would severely injure or kill a normal human, leave him with little to no discomfort. In the past, he has survived multiple blows from the likes of The Hulk, as well as surviving a point-blank missile explosion.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #524}} Spider-Man's body is durable to the point where tensing his super-strong muscles while being punched in the torso by a trained heavyweight boxer caused the attacker's wrists to break. Spider-Man has stated that he must roll with punches thrown by people without similar strength or durability, in order to avoid breaking their wrists. Spider-Man is durable enough to survive getting beaten down by Colossus and Magik when they were powered up by the Phoenix Force.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men #9}} His arm was strong enough to block [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] while the speedster was in motion.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #71}}

*'''[[Superhuman Agility]]:''' Spider-Man's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are all enhanced to levels that are far beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete. Spider-Man is extraordinarily limber and his tendons and connective tissues are twice as elastic as the average human being is despite their physical strength. He has the combined agility and acrobatic prowess of the most accomplished circus aerialists and acrobats. He can also perform any complicated sequence of gymnastic stunts such as flips, rolls, and springs. He can easily match or top any Olympic record at gymnastics apparatus such as flying rings, climbing ropes, horizontal bars, trampolines, and even comparable to the likes of [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 16}}{{r|Spider-Man The Ultimate Guide #1}}

*'''[[Healing Factor|Regenerative Healing Factor]]:''' Spider-Man is able to rapidly heal and regenerate from harm faster and more extensively than normal humans are capable of.{{r|Spider-Man: Back in Black Handbook Vol 1 1}} After getting his powers, he soon found that his eyesight was repaired, discarding his glasses.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #8}} During a battle with a villain called the Masked Marauder, Spider-Man was rendered completely blind. However, after about two hours, his sight was perfect, albeit sensitive for nearly an hour after.{{r|{{cl|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #25}}-[[Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #29|29]]}} He also healed a broken arm,{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 2}} in just one night.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 3}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 4}} And, in his encounter with Firebrand, Spider-Man suffered severe third-degree burns, but completely recovered in a little over two days. Although, he privately admitted that he can't heal "Wolverine-quick."{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #700.3|700.4}} Despite all this feats, Spider-Man himself doesn't consider he has a healing factor.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 10}}

*'''Enhanced Immune System:''' Due to his accelerated metabolism, Spider-Man has a higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans, and he can recover from the effects of larger doses rapidly.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #87}} During an encounter with the Swarm, Spider-Man was incapacitated by thousands of bee stings but recovered in less than 24 hours.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #37}} His resistance and recovery time to other toxins and diseases varies, but is typically significantly higher than normal.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #12}} Spider-Man's unique physiology even allowed him to recover from the effects of [[Vampires|vampirism]] as stated by Blade, his radioactive blood would kill the enzymes responsible for his transformation and revert him to normal.{{r|Blade Vol 4 1}} Spider-Man was able to recover completely from acid being spat into his eyes by the new Vulture although the extent of the damage may have been restricted due to his superhuman durability;{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #594}} however, Spider-Man has the normal human tolerance for alcoholic beverages.{{r|Web of Spider-Man #38}}

*'''Superhuman Equilibrium:''' Spider-Man possesses the ability to achieve a state of perfect equilibrium in any position imaginable. He seems able to adjust his position by instinct, which enables him to balance himself on virtually any object, no matter how small or narrow.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1}}

*'''[[Superhuman Reflexes]]:''' Spider-Man's [[reflexes]] are similarly enhanced and are currently about forty times greater than those of an ordinary human.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 26}} In combination with his spider-sense, the speed of his reflexes allows him to dodge almost any attack, or even gunfire, given sufficient distance.{{r|Spider-Man #28}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #674}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Family Business #1}} Spider-Man has even been shown in some cases, to be able to dodge gunfire using just his reflexes without his spider-sense.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #665}}

*'''Spider-Sense:''' Spider-Man possesses a precognitive danger or "spider" sense which warns him of potential or immediate danger by the manifestation of a tingling sensation in the back of his skull, and links with his superhuman kinesthetics, enabling him to evade most any injuries unless he cognitively overrides his automatic reflexes. The precise nature of this sense is unknown, though the [[Karn (Earth-001)|Master Weaver]] states it is enabled by his connection to the [[Web of Life and Destiny]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 15}} It appears to be a simultaneous clairvoyant response to a wide variety of phenomena (everything from falling safes to speeding bullets to thrown punches), which has given several hundredths of a second warning, which is sufficient time for his reflexes to allow him to avoid injury. The sense also can create a general response on the order of several minutes: he cannot discern the nature of the threat by the sensation. He can, however, discern the severity of the danger by the strength of his response to it. Spider-Man's spider-sense is directional and can guide him to or away from hidden weapons and enemies. Sudden and extreme threats can cause his spider-sense to react with painful intensity. Spider-Man can also sense and dodge attacks directed randomly or by artificial intelligence. Using his spider-sense to time his enhanced reflexes, Spider-Man can casually dodge attacks up to and including automatic-weapons fire, provided there is sufficient distance. His spider-sense is sufficiently well-linked to his reflexes to the point that a threat can trigger them even when Spider-Man is asleep or stunned. His spider-sense has helped him preserve his secret identity since it alerts him to observers or cameras when changing into or out of his costume. The spider-sense does react to those who Peter does not consider to be a threat, such as Aunt May, or when a fellow hero makes a bluff while playing poker. Spider-Man can choose to ignore his spider-sense, and distraction or fatigue diminishes its effectiveness. Spider-Man's fighting style incorporates the advantage that his "spider-sense" provides him. His body begins to produce more adrenaline after the sense is triggered, an extension of the 'fight or flight syndrome.' Even when he does not have the use of his eyes, Spider-Man can still use his Spider-Sense in a similar fashion to [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil's]] Radar Sense to help him see by sensing the direction the danger is coming from by listening on the loudest noise around him. This was first used after Spider-Man was temporarily blinded by a device{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #27}} but was recently used again to help locate the new [[Jimmy Natale (Earth-616)|Vulture]] after his acidic breath blinded him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #593|594}} As a result of the Venom symbiote bonding to Spider-Man, it and its offspring do not trigger his spider-sense -- a trait that sometimes has been attributed to symbiotes in general.{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men Vol 1 5}}
**'''Radio Frequency Detection:''' Peter's spider-sense also enables him to track certain radio frequencies, which he has used to his advantage via his [[Spider-Tracer|Spider-Tracers]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 11}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 250}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Powers
| body = '''Upgrades:''' Spider-Man received several upgrades in recent years as a result of two different adventures, the first via the genetic manipulations of the Queen, and subsequently during the Other's evolution. These powers were later presumably removed following the One More Day saga.

<big>'''Queen's Mutation'''</big>

Following an encounter with an enemy known as the [[Adriana Soria (Earth-616)|Queen]], and her genetic manipulations of Peter's body, his Spider powers were augmented to varying degrees.
*'''Enhanced Superhuman Strength:''' Originally able to lift 10 tons, he could now lift about 15 tons.
*'''Psychic Alignment with Arthropods:''' Peter's spider-sense improved, creating a psychic alignment with his environment, specifically a more empathic and sympathetic relationship with spiders and insects. While connected to the varying populations of spiders he was unable to communicate with them directly or command them.
*'''Biological/Organic Webbing Generation:''' Spider-Man was also gifted with the ability to organically produce his own silk webbing from glands within his forearms, limited by his body's health and nutrition. These organic webs had many of the same properties as Spider-Man's artificial webbing, so he had no trouble utilizing them, though they required a week to decay rather than two hours. The silk was released through a spinneret near each wrist containing a central web spigot orifice used for web-slinging and draglines, supplemented by several radial minor spigots for other types of webs connected to specialized glands.

<big>'''The Other Evolution'''</big>
{{main|Other: Evolve or Die}}
After a near-death experience fighting Morlun, Spider-Man became the receptacle of a powerful Spider-Totem called [[Other (Spider-Totem) (Multiverse)|the Other]], causing his body to undergo a metamorphosis that granted him greater power than ever before after literally shedding his skin. Following his bargain with Mephisto, Peter no longer possessed the Other's powers, which were later bestowed to his clone Kaine.
*'''Enhanced Wall-Crawling:''' Spider-Man's wall-crawling abilities were heightened even further, allowing him to stick to a surface with any part of his body, for example, his back.
*'''Enhanced Superhuman Strength:''' Spider-Man's superhuman strength was enhanced as a result of his evolution by the Other, allowing him to lift up to 20 tons.
*'''Enhanced Superhuman Durability, Speed, Agility, and Reflexes:''' Spider-Man's durability, speed, agility, and reflexes were all enhanced even further as a result of his evolution, allowing him to run fast enough to chase an automobile, perform even greater feats of agility, and react much quicker than ever before.
*'''Psychological Awareness of Environment:''' Perhaps as an upgrade to his spider-sense and his psychic alignment with arthropods, Spider-Man received psychological awareness of his environment as a whole, allowing him to traverse across any environment without fear, even when blinded or in extremely dark conditions. Spider-Man could ascertain non-threatening information, such as detecting the concealed presence of loved ones.
*'''Night Vision:''' Spider-Man received enhanced night vision as a part of his evolution by the Other, allowing him to see in pitch-black conditions.
*'''Vibration and Air Current Sense via Hair and webbing:''' Along with night vision, Spider-Man gained superhuman sensitivity via touch, allowing the hairs on his body to sense air currents around him and vibrations via his webbing.
*'''Augmented Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Spider-Man had his healing factor enhanced, thereby gained the ability to almost instantaneously recover from severe injuries such as broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage in a matter of minutes. Ambushed by the Rhino he received heavy bodily damage, only to heal minutes later without medical attention. Peter was heavily beaten and drugged, suffering multiple fractures and blood loss by the Jack O' Lantern and Jester during the superhuman Civil War, yet was completely healed a few hours later.
*'''Hibernation Healing:''' Only used once. Peter was able to come back from near-death due to making a cocoon with his webbing and hibernating within it. He also shed his skin to heal, as most spiders due once in their lifetime.
*'''Stingers:''' Spider-Man developed retractable, razor-sharp stingers that were located within his arms beneath his wrists. They released a polyamine venom, causing direct trauma and/or flaccid paralysis via interference with nerve impulse transmission. While a typical injection could paralyze a normal adult human for several hours, the impalement proved fatal to the nigh-invulnerable Morlun. While Ero, later revealed to be the Other's manifestation, initially stated the stingers could only be used against supernatural threats, Parker was able to subconsciously extend his stingers in response to stress later on.
*'''Fangs:''' Spider-Man grew a mouth full of razor-sharp fangs that he used to land the fatal blow to Morlun.

<big>'''Mindwipe after "Brand New Day"'''</big>

Although not technically a power, the worldwide mindwipe of Spider-Man's identity as Peter Parker was part of Mephisto's deal to save Aunt May in "Brand New Day" and Dr. Strange's spell in "One Moment in Time." Spider-Man is aware that the whole world has forgotten his secret identity and describes it to Mister Fantastic as a "psychic blind spot," where any evidence which could lead to Spider-Man being Peter Parker, people would not be able to connect the dots, or they would come up with the wrong solution but would accept it as the right one regardless. Not only people's memory was affected, but also every electronic and paper file was modified to have "inexplicable" gaps wherever any data useful to identifying him or his family members would otherwise be. If Spider-Man was to unmask himself - or be unmasked, then any related people witnessing the incident would have their memories returned. Mister Fantastic claims to be able to duplicate the "firewalls" for himself and the Fantastic Four, allowing Spider-Man to safely tell them his identity without fear of compromising his secret. Due to the events of the Spider-Island arc, (when Peter put a video of him having spider-powers on the Internet in hopes of inspiring other spider-powered New Yorkers to better use their powers) while Spider-Man's identity is still kept secret from the mindwipe, the effects of the psychic blindspot supplied by Dr. Strange has been weakened, making it possible for someone to correctly suspect that Peter Parker is Spider-Man if they are able to even if the world as a whole doesn't remember. As a result, [[Carlie Cooper (Earth-616)|Carlie Cooper]] broke up with Peter after she realized his secret,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 673}} and later Norman Osborn figured out his identity when Jameson said that even throwing "his girl" off a bridge didn't stop the wall-crawler from defeating him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #797}} The Hulk later revealed that he still remembered Peter's identity, although apparently Banner doesn't retain the same knowledge. According to Doctor Strange, the spell can only be conjured once.

<big>'''[[Connors Formula|Spider-Lizard]]'''</big>

After being exposed to Connors' [[Doc Connors' Enervator|Enervator]] during his fight against the Lizard and [[Iguana (Earth-616)|Iguana]],{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 34}} Peter was later transformed into Lizard which seemingly granted him the [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)#Powers|powers]] of the Lizard.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 39}}{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 40}}

<big>'''[[Symbiotes (Race)|Symbiotes]]'''</big>

On at least four occasions, Spider-Man has bonded to symbiotes from the planet [[Klyntar (Location)|Klyntar]] -- three of them have taken on the appearance of a black costume with white eyes, white patches on the hands, and large stylized spider emblems on the chest and back. 

The [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|first symbiote]] Peter bonded to while on Battleworld and brought with him to Earth, not realizing it was alive and sentient.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 8}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 252}} Horrified and disgusted by the notion of permanently sharing his body with it, he rejected and tried to kill it.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 252|8}}{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 1}} The symbiote survived - replicating Spider-Man's powers as a result of being bonded to him - and took on the moniker "[[Venom]]." Developing an intense love/hate obsession with Peter, it bonded to a series of subsequent hosts - most notably [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]] - in order to either kill or re-bond to him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 300}} Peter was briefly infected by [[Venom Virus|a virus engineered from the Venom symbiote's biomass]], which transformed him into a slender doppelgänger of Venom.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 36}} When Norman Osborn was bonded to the Carnage symbiote, Eddie loaned the Venom symbiote to Spider-Man so that he could defeat the Red Goblin.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800}}

While teaching at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters#Jean Grey School for Higher Learning|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]], Spider-Man and his class investigated an attack on the S.W.O.R.D space station by a group of symbiote-possessed Brood. In order to take on the symbiote-controlled [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]], Spider-Man temporarily bonded to [[Character Index/Unnamed Symbiotes#Spider-Man's Second Symbiote|one of the symbiotes]]; controlling it with help from [[Martha Johansson (Earth-616)|No-Girl]]. The symbiote managed to overcome No-Girl and take over Spider-Man, transforming him into a monster similar to Venom, but immediately afterward it was separated from him and jettisoned into space.{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men Vol 1 5}}

Peter eventually bonded to a symbiote again. When [[Lee Price (Earth-616)|Lee Price]] was using [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|the Mania symbiote]] to control criminals, he infected Spider-Man as well. However, the hero was freed from his control by Agent Anti-Venom.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 793}}

When the [[Poisons]] attacked Earth, Spider-Man was bonded to [[Character Index/Unnamed Symbiotes#Spider-Man's Fourth Symbiote|a symbiote]] by a [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)/Members#Poison Punisher|Poisoned version of the Punisher]]. After failing to remove it in the same manner he had originally expunged the Venom symbiote, Peter deduced that it had been altered to augment the bonding process and set out to find who had done this to them.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 1}} In the end, the symbiote was removed from him and returned to the [[Klyntar (Location)|Klyntar's planet]] with the rest of its abducted brethren.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 5}}

[[File: Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Vol 1 3 Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]

<big>'''[[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]]'''</big>

When Loki created the Tri-Sentinel, Peter gained the powers of the [[Glossary: Enigma Force|Enigma Force]].{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #158}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #329}} With those powers, he even managed to take on the likes of [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Dr. Doom]] and [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]].
:*'''Enhanced Superhuman Strength:''' Spider-Man's superhuman strength was enhanced as a result of the Enigma Force, allowing him to throw the Hulk all the way to space, with only a single punch.
:*'''Enhanced Superhuman Durability, Speed, Agility, and Reflexes:''' Spider-Man's durability, speed, agility, and reflexes were all enhanced even further as a result of becoming Captain Universe.
:*'''Flight:''' Spider-Man gained the ability to fly. His speed was so fast, he was able to get the Hulk from space in some minutes.
:*'''Energy Blasts:''' Spider-Man gained the ability to shoot concentrated energy blasts from his hand.
:*'''Enhanced Spider-Sense:''' Spider-Man's spider-sense was enhanced to the extent that it allowed him to sense everything.
:*'''Superhuman Sight and Hearing:''' Spider-Man was able to hear and see danger from far away.
:*'''Molecular Change:''' Spider-Man could use this ability to make his webbing as hard as Adamantium or simply change its shape.

<big>'''[[Glossary:Gamma Mutates|Spider-Hulk]]'''</big>

During the fight with the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], a device called The Biokenitic Energy Absorber, had absorbed Hulk's gamma radiation and struck Spider-Man. This turned Spider-Man into Spider-Hulk, while seemingly possessing Hulk's [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)#Powers|powers]], for a short time.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 69|70}}

Spider-Man would turn back into the Spider-Hulk after being exposed by the gamma energy of [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]] and be able to hold his own when fighting Hulked-Out Thor and other people who have also been turned into Red Hulks.{{r|World War Hulks: Spider-Man vs Thor Vol 1 1|2}}

Spider-Man has briefly transformed into the Spider-Hulk again when Loki attempted to expel Banner's gamma radiation from his body in an attempt to help him, only for the radiation to be absorbed by Spider-Man's also-mutated physiology. With the aid of the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man was able to devise a means of transferring the energy back to Banner, with the Hulk later thanking Peter for choosing to stay with Banner as he transformed back into the Hulk.{{r|Immortal Hulk: Great Power Vol 1 1}}

<big>'''Enhanced Spider-Sense'''</big>

In an attempt to cripple Spider-Man's spider-sense through the use of a spider-jammer, [[Tiberius Stone (Earth-616)|Tiberius Stone]] unintentionally augmented the spider-sense to an overwhelming degree.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #695}} Spider-Man was able to sense every potential threat, ranging from a tiny paper cut to a static shock, however, the effect was only temporary, as Tiberius managed to perfect his spider-jammer.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #696}}

<big>'''[[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)#Powers|Doctor Octopus]]'''</big>

After having his body temporarily swapped with [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #697}} Peter acquired the same equipment which gave the original Doctor Octopus his abilities:

*'''[[Doctor Octopus' Tentacles|Tentacles]]:''' Doctor Octopus' superhuman abilities derive from the four mentally-controlled, electronically-powered, telescoping, prehensile titanium-steel tentacles attached to a stainless steel harness encircling his body from lower chest to waist. Each tentacle, approximately five inches in diameter, terminates in three single-jointed pincers. The pincers are able to rotate in relation to the arm for 360 degrees, in a screwdriver-like twisting motion. Each tentacle segment contains four high-efficiency electric motors equipped with a clutched, helical-gear train, independently mounted on frictionless gimbals and housed in four thin, overlapping layers of titanium-niobium steel. The titanium-steel alloy is light, has high-tensile strength, a high melting point, and high thin-wall rigidity. The motors get their power from a small nuclear-powered thermo-electric generator, which can provide several hundred watts per hour for up to five years before needing to replace its U-239 core. The tentacles have been modified since the time of the original accident to include high-efficiency battery packs (enabling movement when cutting off from the central power source) and individual micro-circuit control modules (enabling each arm to perform certain pre-programmed actions when Octopus loses conscious control). In the event that Octopus loses consciousness, the control module of each arm has enough pre-programmed conditional responses in its memory chip to enable it to perform a relatively complex sequence of actions, such as saving his life. The trauma of his arm or arms being separated from the harness causes a period of disorientation in which his arms flail about uncontrollably until the pre-programming takes over.
**'''Telepathic Control over Tentacles:''' Octopus can control the actions of his artificial arms psionically, even when they have been severed from his body and are separated from him by vast distances (a distance of 900 miles has been recorded).
**'''Telescoping:''' Each tentacle is approximately six feet long at full contraction, but can extend to a maximum of 24 feet in length. 
**'''Superhuman Striking Force:''' Each tentacle is capable of moving at a speed of ninety feet per second and strike with the force of a jackhammer.
**'''High-Wind Generation''' The tentacles can generate 50 miles per hour winds if spun like a giant fan.
**'''Wall-Climbing and Traveling:''' By combining the intrinsic strength of both his tentacles and the pincers, Doctor Octopus can scale stone, brick, or concrete walls by rending "handholds" in the surface of the wall. Octopus is able to use his tentacles for traversing horizontal distances as well. At full extension, he can travel high above the ground as if on stilts, either using two tentacles or for maximum speed (approximately 50 miles per hour), four tentacles.
**'''Sensation Feeling:''' Although there are no nerve endings throughout the length of his artificial arms, Octopus can "feel" basic sensations with them. As a result of the mutagenic changes from exposure to radiation during the accident, electrical connections have been made from his chest harness to his spine. Thus, Doctor Octopus can mentally perceive "tactile" sensations by feeling the amount of electrical resistance that the pincer's electric motors feel when the pincers grasp an object.

**EDITORS, PLEASE DO NOT INFLATE PARKER'S LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE TO GENIUS OR SUPER-GENIUS, AS IT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE HANDBOOKS**

-->

'''Gifted Intellect:''' Peter Parker possesses a natural talent for science, standing out as a top student in high school and college. He developed inventions such as his [[Web-Shooters]] and his signature web formula,{{r|Amazing Fantasy Vol 1 15}} and the [[Spider-Tracer]]s when he was still in high school.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 11}} Peter's intellect has as well earned him a place among the think tank [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon Labs]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 648}} as well as an acknowledgement by some of the Earth's most brilliant minds such as [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]].{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #15}} In addition, Peter's college IQ scores were the same as those posted by Reed Richards at the same age.{{r|Spider-Man Human Torch #3}} Peter was also able to hack into [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]] system to override [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]'s control command over the [[Iron Spider Armor]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #535}} and discover [[Glossary:Parker Particles|Parker Particles]], a force of energy tied into the continuous expansion of the universe that offers greater power than the Phoenix Force, according to Reed Richards.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #692}}

'''Expert Inventor/Engineer:''' With his knowledge and expertise in mechanics, robotics and engineering Peter has been able to use his amazing intellect and resources at Horizon Labs to create many inventions such as the four [[Spider-Armor]]s, the Spidey Stealth Suit, his famous Web-Shooters, the Cryo-Cube 3000 and the noise reduction headphones. At [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]] he invented a magnitude of devices including but not limited to the [[Anti-Electro Netting]] which successfully de-powered Electro,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 6}} an antidote for the Zodiac poison,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 1}} and easy to apply holographic plating.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 2}}

'''Skilled Photographer:''' Peter is a very skilled photographer and has worked for the Daily Bugle and the Front Line as a photographer.<ref>''[[Marvel Versus DC|DC versus Marvel Comics]]'' [http://www.scribd.com/doc/28828573/DC-Marvel-Comics-DC-vs-Marvel-The-Characters Profile]</ref>

'''Talented Teacher:''' Peter is a naturally talented teacher and has taught science at Midtown High.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 #30}}

'''Master Acrobat:''' Thanks to his great strength and phenomenal equilibrium, Parker is an excellent athlete, excelling in all gymnastic fields and being able to perform every acrobatic stunt ever performed, including others that can never be performed by even an Olympic acrobat.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #652}}

[[File:Peter Parker (Earth-616) and Jessica Drew (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 687 001.png|thumb|Spider-Man defeating Spider-Woman.]]
'''Master Martial Artist:''' Peter has through time become an excellent hand-to-hand combatant utilizing a fighting style that directly complements his superhuman abilities. His methods are volatile, enabling him to rival practically all types of combatants. In addition to this, Peter has been trained by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] in unarmed combat.{{r|Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #1}} After temporarily losing his spider-sense, Peter received formal combat training from [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]] and together created a new martial art style dubbed "the [[Way of the Spider]]." However, since the return of his spider-sense, Peter let his training lapse.{{r|Spider-Geddon Handbook Vol 1 1}}

Spider-Man's feats include defeating [[Pyreus Kril (Earth-616)|Firelord]], [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], the [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Six]] single-handedly, Quicksilver,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #71}} the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] single-handedly,{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #3}} Spider-Man (Otto Octavius),{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 11}} [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]],{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2011 Spider-Man}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #687}} both [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]],{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 299}} and [[Morlun (Earth-001)|Morlun]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 35}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 14}} He has stalemated Captain America,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 534}} Julia Carpenter, and Shang-Chi.{{r|Giant-Size Spider-Man Vol 1 2}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 666}}

'''Bilingual:''' In addition to speaking English, Peter has also learned Mandarin.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 1}}

| Strength                  = Peter is capable of lifting approximately 10 tons in his original body. He was formerly able to lift 15 tons after being mutated by the Queen, and then 20 tons during The Other event. After both mutations were undone as a result of [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]]'s alteration of reality, Spider-Man's strength level has remained unspecified. Peter has been shown to be able to lift cars with ease and even tanks. Under extreme amounts of stress or when sufficiently enraged, Peter is known for cutting loose and demonstrating even greater levels of strength, such as supporting the weight of the Daily Bugle building,{{r|Spider-Man #98}} landing a private jet,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #694}} supporting a fraction of a stadium full of people that was about to collapse,{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 #15}} breaking through [[Iron Man Armor Model 42|Iron Man's armor]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Who Am I? #1}} and even breaking through eight of Doctor Octopus' [[carbonadium]] [[Doctor Octopus' Tentacles|tentacles]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #687}} He has even been able to lift a large pile of iron-debris equivalent to the weight of a locomotive approximately 130 tons.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #33}} While he wore the Spider-Armor MK IV, Peter's already superhuman strength level was enhanced even further to an unknown degree, to the point where he could easily grab Taskmaster's body and use it like a mace to knock out the Wrecker, easily overpower the Superior Octopus' tentacles,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 30}} and stagger and knockback Hyperion with one of his punches.{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 4 11}} However since that suit was destroyed, he returned to his normal strength level.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 31}}
| Weaknesses                = Unlike many superheroes, Spider-Man does not have a weakness he is automatically vulnerable to, but in recent years methods have been created to render him vulnerable.

'''Spider-Sense Disruption:''' Spider-Man's Spider-Sense can lose its effectiveness if it is blocked or temporarily weakened by specialized equipment or certain drugs. It also would not trigger if it detects something that is not registered as a threat like the Spider-Man clones or the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]], its offspring, [[Anti-Venom]], or the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]]. When deprived of his spider-sense, Spider-Man becomes vulnerable to surveillance and attack, and web-slinging requires most of his concentration.

'''Ethyl Chloride:''' Perhaps as a side effect of gaining his powers, Spider-Man is susceptible to the pesticide ethyl chloride. This chemical is frequently used as a weapon by the [[Spider-Slayer]]s.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 106}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 291}}

'''Bad Luck:''' Not exactly a flaw or a disadvantage in his crime-fighting, Peter Parker's life is generally a complicated one. Peter has been forced on numerous occasions to lie to people close to him, be late in his commitments, get away from people, and so on for the sake of his secret identity. This inherent difficulty to get his superhero life secrecy, matched with the number of superhuman events and beings in New York and simply coincidence has, in turn, lead Peter to aggravate people around himself, even ones close to himself, and to, more often than not, run into trouble and embarrassment. Peter often remarks whenever he misses an opportunity to better his social life, improve his finances, or even get to work on time, (due to his super-heroics), "Typical Parker Luck."

{{Navigation 
| title = Former Weaknesses
| body = '''No Driving Skill:''' Due to having his web-shooters since he was a teen and being busy fighting crime, Peter never learned to drive. This is one of the reasons which made the [[Spider-Mobile]] a terrible idea. Peter can neither fly a helicopter nor the Avengers' Quinjet.{{r|New Avengers #18}}

'''Memory Loss:''' Peter doesn't remember certain events in his life due to Octavius' mindwipe when Peter tried to take his body back after Octavius switched their minds.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #9}} He currently possesses 31 pieces of his memories left from the mindwipe.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #27.NOW}}

'''Anti-Venom's Proximity:''' Anti-Venom's failed attempt to cure Spider-Man of his radioactive blood resulted in Spider-Man's powers slowly canceling out whenever Anti-Venom is too close to him. Also if Anti-Venom binds him with his own webbing abilities it will also negate Spider-Man's powers until Spider-Man can get it off his body. This weakness no longer applies due to Eddie Brock sacrificing the Anti-Venom symbiote to cure the population of New York. However, [[Anti-Venom II (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a duplicate of the Anti-Venom]] was created in a failed attempt of Spider-Man to kill the Venom symbiote with a vat of an Anti-Venom serum.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc. Alpha #1}} However, the duplicate did not appear to adversely affect Spider-Man's powers and later meet its death along with Flash Thompson.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800}}

'''[[Web-Shooters]]:''' Parker's brilliance at physical science allowed him to create web-shooters for use when he became Spider-Man.<ref>''[http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/05/smart_heroes/index_01.htm Smartest Superheroes]''</ref> The twin devices worn on his wrists are able to shoot thin strands of a special web fluid at high pressure and speeds.

'''[[Spider-Man's Utility Belt|Utility Belt]]:''' Upon first entering the superhero world, Peter created a utility belt that held extra clips of [[Spider-Man's Web-Shooters|webbing]], [[Spider-Tracer]]s, and his [[Spider-Signal]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #2}} Recently, he upgraded his utility belt to hold cartridges of different types of webbing, freeze capsules, new Spider-Tracers as well as a newly upgraded Spider-Signal that has a UV light setting for forensic analysis.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #675}} 

'''[[Spider-Tracer]]s:''' Spider-Man uses small electronic "Spider-Tracers" of his own design that allows him to track objects or individuals. Typically, Spider-Man plants or throws one on a departing enemy and follows the target to their hideout. He also uses a launching device in his [[Spider-Man's Web-Shooters|web-shooters]] for better range and accuracy. He originally used an electronic receiver to follow the signals of the tracers but later modifies their signal so he can follow it with his spider-sense. He can follow the signal within a 100-yard radius. After the temporarily lost his spider-sense he used [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon Lab]]'s resources to make new and improved spider-tracers with listening devices, G.P.S. and camouflage. Other modifications include tracers made of anti-metal [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] [[Vibranium]] which melts metals in contact, a cryogenic Spider-Tracer used to freeze [[Morris Bench (Earth-616)|Hydro-Man]].

'''[[Spider-Signal]]:''' A powerful light emitted from Spider-Man's [[Spider-Man's Utility Belt|utility belt]] to announce his arrival to criminals.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #3}} Peter later updated his Spider-Signal with a UV light setting for forensic analysis.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #675}} 

'''[[Avengers Identicard]]:''' A credit card-sized gadget designed by Tony Stark for the identification of all Avengers. It was used by Spider-Man when the police interrogated The Metropolitan Museum of Art after a fight between Mister Negative and Anti-Venom,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #664}} and has since used it on other occasions.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #690}}{{r|Inhuman Special #1}}

'''[[Spider-Man's Suit]]:'''
* '''[[Spider-Armor MK II]]:''' Peter created version 2.0 of his Spider-Armor to compensate for the loss of his spider-sense, due to the fact that without this ability, he can be easily wounded by bullets.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #656}} This suit has since been placed back in storage in Peter's office at Horizon Labs.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #698}} It was most likely destroyed alongside Horizon itself.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #19}} A replica of the suit was later stored at Parker Industries.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 1}}
[[File: Spider-Man's Anti-Sinister Six Suit from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 682.jpg|130px|thumb|right|Spider-Armor MK III]]
* '''[[Spider-Armor MK III]]:''' Created by Peter Parker with [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon Labs]] vast resources to fight the [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Six]] if needed in a last resort. When [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] started his last master plan before dying, Spider-Man knew he would have to use it to stop Octopus' attempt to speed up the Greenhouse effect.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #682}} This suit has since been repaired and placed back in storage in Peter's office at Horizon Labs.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #698}} After Horizon Labs was destroyed,{{r|Superior Spider-Man #19}} Spider-Man kept the suit in his lab at Parker Industries.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 1}}
[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 539 Textless.jpg|130px|thumb|right|The Black Suit]]
* '''Black Suit:''' After Spider-Man removed the symbiote suit, his girlfriend, the Black Cat, made him a non-living duplicate, as she thought it was "sexier" than his red and blue suit. While the two suits were used interchangeably initially, the black suit eventually became Spider-Man's primary suit after his red and blue suit was destroyed. However, after Venom's attack on Mary Jane Watson, she forced him to abandon the suit for good. Thereafter, he only occasionally wore the black suit as a last resort, when his red and blue suit was out of commission. He returned to wearing the black suit for a brief period of time after his Aunt May was dying in a hospital due to an attempt on Peter's life by Wilson Fisk. With Kraven's resurrection during Gauntlet, Spider-Man uncovered a copy of the suit left as a taunt by Kraven while searching for his clone, Kaine, and wore it while defeating the Kraven family. The Black Suit, in every sense of the word, represents Spider-Man's dark and grim persona. This suit is the only costume aside from Spider-Man's original to have the most longevity.
[[Image:Peter Parker (Earth-616) from Spider-Man Deadpool Vol 1 17 001.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Superior Spider-Man Mark III]]
*'''[[Superior Spider-Man's Suit#Third Version|Superior Spider-Man Mark III]]:''' After his mind swap with [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]], Peter returned to his body and got rid of [[Superior Spider-Man's Suit|Doc Ock's Costume]] and returned to his classic red and blue costume and, more further, the Mark IV Spider-Armor. Yet, he still could use it anytime he wanted, but he chose not to. After being driven to kill by [[Itsy Bitsy (Earth-616)|Itsy-Bitsy]], and under the influence of [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]], he upgraded this costume ever further in order to kill her. [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] even mentioned that he looked "kinda superiorly Doc Ock-y." Some upgrades include Spider-Arms, Laser Beams, Web Wings, and Nerve Hacking Technology. Spider-Man, however, fought against Mephisto's influence and didn't kill her. Like the black-suited costume, this one also shows Peter's dark side, which was the intention of Doc Ock when he created it, the costume making him appear more like a threat, that better suited him as a "hero."{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 17|18}}

'''Black Symbiotic Costume:''' Spider-Man first acquired the symbiotic costume during [[Secret Wars (1984 Event)|the first Secret Wars]]. When his traditional red-and-blue suit was damaged, [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] and [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] informed of a machine that could repair it. However, the machine released [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a black sphere]] that, when Spider-Man touched it, covered his body and, possibly reacting to his thoughts about the new costume worn by [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|the second Spider-Woman]], created a new one to him, dissolving the old ragged one in the process.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #8}} After [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] informed him that it was an alien symbiote, Spider-man tried to get rid of it.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 252}} Eventually, the suit bounded with [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]] and they became [[Venom]], one of the deadliest foes of Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 300}} In other occasions, Spider-Man temporarily recovered the black costume: in the second time, a group of symbiote-possessed Brood attacked the S.W.O.R.D space station and Spider-Man and X-Men investigated, and during the attack, Spider-Man bonded with [[Character Index/Unnamed Symbiotes#Spider-Man's Second Symbiote|one of the symbiotes]] that was being controlled with the help of No-Girl in order to take on the symbiote-controlled Deathbird, though was he separated from it afterward so he wasn't possessed;{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men #5}} In the third time, a [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)/Members#Poison Punisher|Poison Punisher]] forcibly bonded Spider-Man to [[Character Index/Unnamed Symbiotes#Spider-Man's Fourth Symbiote|another symbiote]] so he could be assimilated by the [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)|Hive]], though after the [[Poisons]]' defeat, he was separated from it and it was returned to the [[Klyntar (Location)|Planet Klyntar]].{{r|{{cl|Venomized Vol 1 1}}-[[Venomized Vol 1 5|5]]}} Spider-Man bonded with Venom again when [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] used the [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage symbiote]] to become the [[Red Goblin]]. Their re-bonding made Spider-Man actually care for the Venom symbiote, at least to some extent - this could be evident when they both got separated, with Spider-Man saying to it avoid the fire around them.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #800}}

[[Image:Civil War Vol 1 3 Turner Variant Textless.jpg|130px|thumb|right|Iron Spider Armor]]
'''[[Iron Spider Armor]]:''' When Iron Man first had to make a quick escape, he made this armor out of anything he could get his hands on - and it shows. After Peter Parker was resurrected from a battle to the death against Morlun, his friend and teammate Tony Stark built him a new suit, using Stark Tech, and obviously influenced by the colors of Stark's Iron Man Armor. Peter Parker abandoned this armor when he changed sides during the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], from the pro-[[Superhuman Registration Act|Registration]] unit (lead by Iron Man) to the anti-Registration side, the [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] (lead by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]). Peter would later create a duplicate of the suit and store it in Parker Industries.{{r|Spider-Man 2099 Vol 3 1}}

The costume's new color was a consequence of the suit being locked in that design, which was made on purpose by [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Madame Web]], who wanted it changed for what the [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider (Ben Reilly)]] meant in Kaine's past.

** [[Robbie Thompson|Robbie Thompson]], the writer of ''[[Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1|Spider-Man/Deadpool]]'', wanted [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] to learn Spider-Man's secret identity; however, [[Marvel Comics]] would not allow that. So in the [[Manipulator (Story Arc)|last story arc]] of the series, Thompson created an "[[Glossary: Event|event]]," with himself as the main villain [[Robbie Thompson (Earth-TRN841)|Manipulator]], in order for Marvel to allow Deadpool to learn Spider-Man's identity. At the end that didn't happen, as Spider-Man and Deadpool put the Manipulator in jail.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 50}}
** Spider-Man introduced Normie Osborn as his godson to [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan Brock]] and [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|The Maker]]. Whether any of them have put two-and-two together is unknown.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}}

* It has been shown that those with telepathic abilities such as [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]] can sense Peter's spider-sense when it is activated by danger and that (with some difficulty) by linking their minds together his spider-sense can be telepathically broadcasted to those around him, to allow them to sense the same danger that he does.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 2 1}}
* Allegedly, Peter had heard that his school's dance team were throwing out old bodysuits, snuck into school after dark, found one that fit him, obtained two one-way mirrors from the Drama Department's prop closet (for his mask lenses) and spent an hour silkscreening the web pattern onto the bodysuit in the art room.

===Creation===
* [[Jack Kirby]] has claimed to have created Spider-Man and have given the character to [[Steve Ditko]].{{r|{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/jack-kirby-interview/6/|title=Jack Kirby Interview|work=The Comics Journal|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=February 29 2020|first=Gary|last=Groth}}}}
** This may tie to an alleged "cover-up" which stated that Steve Ditko when designing Spider-Man, was partially inspired by [[Earth-313710|Ben Copper Halloween Costume]]'s Spiderman costume which predates Spider-Man.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://hero-envy.blogspot.com/2012/10/1963-ben-cooper-spider-man-halloween.html|title=THE 1963 BEN COOPER SPIDER-MAN HALLOWEEN COSTUME|work=Hero Envy|date=October 12 2012|accessdate=February 29 2020|first=John|last=Cimino}}}} And according to some alleged sources, Jack Kirby used to work for the Ben Copper company, designing their costumes.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/07/14/did-stan-lee-steal-spider-man-from-a-brooklyn-costume-shop/|title=The billion-dollar Spider-Man ‘cover-up’|work=New York Post|date=July 14 2015|accessdate=February 29 2020|first=Reed|last=Tucker}}}}
* Steve Ditko originally envisioned Spider-Man's costume orange and purple. Ditko has assumed it was changed to red and blue either due to the printing limitations of the era or because Marvel thought red and blue was more striking.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/steve-ditko-wanted-spider-man-to-be-orange-and-purple/|title=Steve Ditko Designed Spider-Man to be Orange and Purple|work=BleedingCool|first=Rich|last=Johnson|date=31 August 2020|accessdate=31 August 2020}}}}
* During Steve Ditko's time on the ''Amazing Spider-Man'' series, when shooting webs Spider-Man only stuck out his thumb and pointing finger minus the pinky finger. Because Steve Ditko used to draw the characters with their pinky finger sticking out, this caused Spider-Man to also stick out his pinky fingers when shooting webs.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/the-comics-journal-258-february-2004/|title=The Comics Journal No. 258|work=The Comics Journal|date=February 2004|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}}}
** Spider-Man shares this hand gesture with Doctor Strange, who was also co-created by Steve Ditko, this was also acknowledged by the characters themselves in {{cl|Spider-Man: Fever Vol 1 3}}.
* It's revealed in ''Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee'', that Spider-Man was based on the [[wikipedia: Spider (pulp fiction)|Spider (Richard Wentworth)]], despite Lee stating that he was inspired by a fly walking on a wall.<ref name=Stanley/>
* When Stan Lee first pitched the idea of Spider-Man, his publisher, [[Martin Goodman|Martin Goodman]], was at first against that since people hated spiders. This is why Spider-Man made his debut in {{cl|Amazing Fantasy Vol 1 15}}, since the ''[[Amazing Adult Fantasy Vol 1|Amazing Adult Fantasy]]'' series was planned to be canceled.<ref name=Stanley>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75HonYg6dts|title=Stan Lee on creating Spider-Man (Full 2000 CNN interview)|work=YouTube|date=September 3 2016|accessdate=February 29 2020|author=CNN}}</ref>
** This may actually tie to the fact that Spider-Man was allegedly going to be portrayed as horror comic, since according to the ''Horror Comics: The Illustrated History'', [[Steve Ditko|Steve Ditko]] was famous for drawing horror comics, and this can be witnessed in Spider-Man's first appearance as he was drawn with a horror atmosphere, which Stan Lee liked.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9byf6fAac0|title=Stan Lee Creating Spider-Man - The Everyman Superhero|work=YouTube|date=August 3 2009|accessdate=February 29 2020}}}} The connection was also acknowledge in [[Gerry Conway|Gerry Conway]]'s book, ''[[Webslinger: Unauthorized Essays On Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]''.

===With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility===
* Spider-Man's famous mantra "with great power, comes great responsibility" is often attributed as a quote from Uncle Ben, however, it was originally the concluding lines of narration to his first appearance in {{cl|Amazing Fantasy #15}}, the anonymous narrator explaining the moral of the story, not advice from his beloved uncle. As this was the lesson he learned from his uncle's death, it slowly became associated with Uncle Ben, and the [[Spider-Man (film)|2002 film]] chose to have the famous phrase come directly from [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-96283)|Ben Parker]] as advice to the newly powered [[Peter Parker (Earth-96283)|Peter]], and this is how the origin of the phrase is commonly understood now.
* The quote "With great power comes great responsibility" was first used by Peter in a comic book in 1987, {{cl|Spider-Man Versus Wolverine Vol 1 1}}. It’s mentioned as a saying of Uncle Ben's in that issue, though not spoken by him. The first time Ben actually said it in a comic was in February 2002, in {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 38}}; meanwhile, in 2016's {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man & Silk: The Spider(fly) Effect Infinite Comic Vol 1 4}}, [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-TRN567)|Ben]] tells [[Peter Parker (Tony Richards) (Earth-616)|Peter]] that the phrase originated with his father, Peter's paternal grandfather.
