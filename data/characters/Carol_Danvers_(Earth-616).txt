| Overview  = Major{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 1}} '''Carol Danvers''', (''Kree name''; Car-Ell){{r|Life of Captain Marvel Vol 2 4}} aka '''[[Captain Marvel]]''',{{r|Life of Captain Marvel Vol 2 4}} formerly '''[[Ms. Marvel]]''',{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 1}} is a former American astronaut and [[United States Air Force (Earth-616)|USAF]] test pilot, who worked for [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Earth-616)|N.A.S.A.]]. She became head of security at N.A.S.A., when it was infiltrated by a [[Kree]] soldier named [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Mar-Vell]]. She was accidentally subjected to the [[Psyche-Magnitron]]{{r|Marvel Fact Files Vol 1 22}} and [[Glossary:Mutate|mutated]] on a genetic level becoming a [[Homo sapiens|Human]]/[[Kree]] Hybrid superhuman warrior.{{r|Life of Captain Marvel Vol 2 3}} Calling herself Ms. Marvel, she established herself as one of the most prominent heroes on [[Earth]].{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 1}} She later became a member of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], "Earth's Mightiest Heroes".{{r|Avengers Vol 1 183}} She was later put in a coma by the [[Homo superior|Mutant]] [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] who absorbed her powers.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes Vol 2 11}} When she recovered she regained her powers as '''[[Binary]]'''.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 164}} Carol went on to adopt the mantle of '''Captain Marvel''' for herself.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man Vol 1 9}}

| History                 = 
===Early Years===
Carol Danvers was born to [[Joseph Danvers, Sr. (Earth-616)|Joe Danvers Sr.]], a former [[United States Navy (Earth-616)|U.S. Navy]] officer and construction worker,{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 13}} and [[Mari-Ell (Earth-616)|Mari-Ell]], a captain in the [[Imperial Kree Army (Earth-616)|Kree Army]]. Mari-Ell had been sent to [[Earth]] on a mission to assimilate with humans and give birth to a hybrid child, but had decided to abandon her former life and cut contact with the Kree. Carol's name comes from Car-Ell, which means "Champion" in Kree.
{{r|Life of Captain Marvel Vol 2 4}}

Carol was raised in a [[Beverly]] suburban community to the north of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts (State)|Massachusetts]],{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 7}} completely unaware that she was not a normal human.{{r|Life of Captain Marvel Vol 2 4}} She also lived with [[Steven Danvers (Earth-616)|Stevie]] and [[Joseph Danvers, Jr. (Earth-616)|Joe Jr.]], two sons Joe had had with his previous, late wife.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 13}} Over the years, Carol's father became increasingly apprehensive for potential retaliation from the Kree for Mari-Ell's desertion, causing him to drink and become abusive. In part due to her Kree heritage,{{r|Life of Captain Marvel Vol 2 4}} Carol dreamed of becoming an astronaut and traveling to distant planets; as a teen she even hitchhiked to [[Cape Canaveral]] to view a launch there. Her father, however, could not accept women as men's equal, and when financial troubles meant he could only send one child to college, he chose Steve despite Carol's superior grades.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 31}} He also dismissed her need for a college education and wanted her to find a good husband instead.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 19}}

===Military Career===
When Carol turned eighteen a few months later, she turned her back on her father and joined the [[United States Air Force (Earth-616)|Air Force]], intending to be a pilot and to get a college degree via the military. Her brother Steve's death in military action would eventually draw Carol back to her family, but she still never felt truly accepted by her father. She quickly rose to the top of her Air Force class, taking the call sign "Cheeseburger." However, Carol's flying career was ended when she was shot down over [[Afghanistan]] while piloting one of [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]'s experimental jets. She was captured by a man named [[Ghazi Rashid (Earth-616)|Ghazi Rashid]], who tortured her for several days. Despite a broken leg and serious injuries, she managed to escape and discovered that Rashid was in contact with a CIA agent codenamed Vitamin.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 32}} She made it to a safe house in [[Wikipedia:Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar-e-Sharif]], where she was debriefed by USAF Colonel [[Michael Rossi (Earth-616)|Michael Rossi]]. No longer cleared for flying due to her supposed amnesia, Carol was recruited by Rossi into Air Force Special Operations.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 33}}

Carol and Rossi had their first mission together in [[Berlin]] (it was on this mission she began calling him "Ace").{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 182}} They followed Vitamin's trail to a tower block, but the apartment was blown up by freelance agent named [[Rick Mason (Earth-616)|Rick Mason]], who then escaped.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 33}} Rossi went on to become Carol's teacher, friend, and then first love.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 19}}{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 36}} Though they eventually drifted apart, Carol always remembered him fondly.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 9}} 

Carol first met Logan (later [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]) in Washington D.C., when she and Logan's old acquaintance [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] rescued him from the combined attacks of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] and the [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 -1}} Carol and Logan were reunited when Fury sent them with pilot [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Ben Grimm]] on a doomed reconnaissance mission over Russia, encountering the deadly spy [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]].{{r|{{cl|Before the Fantastic Four: Ben Grimm and Logan Vol 1 1}}-[[Before the Fantastic Four: Ben Grimm and Logan Vol 1 3|3]]}} By the time they clashed with Logan's long-time foe [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] in [[Canada]] some years later, Carol and Logan were old friends.{{r|Logan: Shadow Society Vol 1 1}} They served on several missions together,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 154}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 133}} and seemingly also had a romantic relationship at some point.{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 24}} When Carol was imprisoned in the [[Wikipedia:Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka]] in [[Moscow]] and everyone else had abandoned her, Wolverine and Rossi disobeyed orders to break her out of prison and smuggled her out of Russia.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 182}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 133}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 236}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 251}} Soon afterwards, having served ten years as a top field agent for Air Force intelligence, she was appointed security chief at Cape Canaveral{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 24}} on the request of [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Earth-616)|NASA]].{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 19}}

===NASA===
As a NASA security officer in the [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]] located in [[Houston]], Carol was involved in [[Peter Corbeau (Earth-616)|Dr. Peter Corbeau]]'s [[Cavorite]] project.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 6}} She would later be assigned to watchdog [[John Kronton (Earth-616)|Doctor Kronton]]'s [[Doomsday Man (Earth-616)|Doomsday Man]] project in the [[Pacific Ocean]].{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 4}} NASA eventually requested her to transfer for an open position as head of security which she accepted, resigning from the Air Force bumping her to full Colonel at retirement. Becoming the youngest security captain in NASA's history, she became embroiled in the schemes of the Kree Empire.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes Vol 1 13}}

During this time, Carol met the Kree soldier [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Mar-Vell]], that unbeknownst to her, posed himself as [[Walter Lawson (Earth-616)|Dr. Walter Lawson]]. Despite her suspicions, they eventually became friends.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 1|5}} Carol almost found out Mar-Vell's real identity when she spotted a Kree ship returning to Earth's orbit, which he had just departed, causing him to suddenly appear in the middle of the road. Even though Mar-Vell denied seeing anything, Carol was determined to prove him wrong.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 6}} While Carol was investigating the landing site, Mar-Vell's superior [[Yon-Rogg (Earth-616)|Yon-Rogg]] tried to murder her, however, Mar-Vell came to her rescue and promised to help her find Doctor Lawson. He used the fingerprints she gave him to make his match the ones Carol had on file, cementing his cover as Lawson.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 7}}

[[File:Psyche-Magnitron from Captain Marvel Vol 1 18.jpg|The Psyche-Magnitron|thumb|200px|right]]
After kissing Lawson,{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 8}} the upcoming few months were disastrous for Danvers. First, she gained access to Lawson's hotel room, but before she could find anything of note, she was abducted by Cyberex.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 9}} She was also later kidnapped by the Organization while driving with Mar-Vell.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 10}} Later, Mar-Vell was forced to steal a moon rocket from the Cape, to escape his former Kree brethren, which resulted in him getting arrest warrant placed upon him by the American government.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 11}} Months later, Carol gave the order to arrest Lawson due to his suspicious long absence since Mar-Vell was lost in space during this period.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 12}} Eventually, Mar-Vell made his way back to Carol, saving Carol from the [[Man-Slayer (Earth-616)|Man-Slayer]], but despite the rescue, the surrounding U.S. military still wanted to shoot him on sight for the earlier treason charges.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 13}} Their stand-off was broken off prematurely by a mind-controlled Iron Man. In the end, Carol was hospitalized and Mar-Vell was forced to leave the planet again unable to assist her.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 14}} 

Eventually, Carol awakened in a hospital, which she would flee when FBI agents came to question her about Walter Lawson. Just outside the hospital, a concussed Carol was kidnapped by Yon-Rogg.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 16}} He brought her to an abandoned subterranean Kree outpost to lure in Mar-Vell. During their battle, Carol was knocked into a damaged Kree [[Psyche-Magnitron]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 18}} Carol's genetic structure was forever altered, unlocking her latent Kree powers.{{r|Life of Captain Marvel Vol 2 5}} However, she remained unaware of this change for months.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 18}}

[[File:Ms. Marvel Vol 2 45 Djurdjevic Variant Textless.jpg|Ms. Marvel's first suit|thumb|200px|left]]
Carol's successful career at NASA was severely damaged because of the events from the months prior. Due to her continued inability to control superhuman incursions, she was removed and reassigned to a minor NASA facility near [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]]. As a result of a raid committed by the superhuman [[Robert Hunter (Earth-616)|Nitro]] on the facility to steal a nerve gas called Compound 13,{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 34}} Carol was demoted to a mere security guard and transferred back to Cape Canaveral.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 40}} In view of her plummeting career, she resigned from NASA.{{r|{{cl|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 1}}-[[Ms. Marvel Vol 1 2|2]]}}

===Becoming Ms. Marvel===
Living off an accumulated salary, Carol wrote an angry tell-all expose on NASA, burning many bridges.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 2}} The best selling book briefly made Carol a celebrity, gaining her a reputation, and she began working as an editor for ''[[Woman Magazine (Earth-616)|Woman Magazine]]'', a publication owned by the ''[[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Daily Bugle]]'', and relocated to a penthouse on [[Park Avenue]]. As a consequence of the Psyche-Magnitron's alterations, Carol developed a split personality to access her Kree powers, which included superhuman strength, flight, and a "seventh sense" that caused her to periodically receive premonitions. Carol would black out and turn into the amnesiac Kree warrior named Ms. Marvel, instantaneously donning a costume which the Psyche-Magnetron had created for her to ease her body's changes. As Ms. Marvel, Carol became a superhero. Both of her identities remained unaware of each other's existence. Under the personality of Ms. Marvel, Carol saved her new boss [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]] from the [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Scorpion]]. Jameson, however, didn't approve of super-heroics and he ordered Carol to write an exposé on her alter-ego for the inaugural issue.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 1}}

Carol continued to experience these blackouts, but they did not stop her from pursuing her career as a writer and editor. In response to her condition, she sought the services of a psychiatrist named [[Michael Barnett (Earth-616)|Michael Barnett]]. In a session, he used hypnosis to prod her mind, and found out that the Psyche-Magnitron had altered her. Immediately afterward, Carol fainted and changed into Ms. Marvel in front of him and left, and he was later unable to relay the discovery to Carol.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 2}} After fighting the [[Kerwin Korman (Earth-616)|Destructor]] and his ex-employer [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], Carol traveled back Cape Canaveral to visit her old friend [[Salia Petrie (Earth-616)|Salia Petrie]] under the guise of writing a cover story for ''Woman Magazine'' about female astronauts. By retracing her old memories in [[Florida (State)|Florida]], Ms. Marvel figured out that she was Carol Danvers, and vice versa.{{r|{{cl|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 3}}-[[Ms. Marvel Vol 1 4|4]]}}

Back in New York, Carol visited Barnett. He hypothesized that Ms. Marvel's seventh sense was responsible for her headaches and loss of consciousness, and he suggested to remove her other persona. Carol refused despite her own uncertainties, and despite the fact that she had become afraid of turning into Ms. Marvel now that she knew what happened with the blackouts.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 5}} After being left in a pile of rubble following a fight with [[Gor-Tok (Earth-616)|Gor-Tok]], Carol was abducted by A.I.M., who had previously observed Carol's exploits and became interested in copying her alien powers.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 6}} Carol managed to resist [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]]'s brainwashing and escaped, with the experience making her less afraid of her other persona.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 7}} Around this time she also encountered rookie superheroine [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jewel]].{{r|Jessica Jones Vol 2 6}}

Following a confrontation with M.O.D.O.K.'s ally [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]], Ms. Marvel found Carol's apartment was blown up by a burglar named [[Geoffrey Ballard (Earth-616)|Geoffrey Ballard]] that she had seen in a vision. She managed to save most of the building but not Carol's treasured possessions, except for a fireproof box containing invaluable documents. When she finished up her work, she tried to infiltrate A.I.M.’s headquarters in order to gain more intel on Deathbird, but she found herself in the middle of two warring A.I.M. factions. In the turmoil of the internal conflict, M.O.D.O.K. and Deathbird tried to launch a rocket to take over NASA's Skylab, a NASA project that examined Cavorite crystals in Earth's orbit. Ms. Marvel stopped their take off, but they both managed to evade justice.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 9|10}}

===Consolidating her Personas===
[[File:Carol Danvers (Earth-616) and Hecate (Earth-616) from Ms. Marvel Vol 1 13 001.jpg|Carol and Hecate|thumb|200px|right]]
During a visit at Cape Canaveral to cover Salia Petrie's first space flight, Carol had a premonition that her friend would be killed in an explosion caused by the Cavorite crystal aboard her shuttle. However, when Ms. Marvel's personality took over, she decided to answer to a different cry for help from a level of the trance that Carol had missed, which had Ms. Marvel involve herself in the [[Elementals (Earth-616)|Elementals]] and [[Hecate (Earth-616)|Hecate]]'s search for the [[Ruby Scarab]].{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 11}} Carol kept trying to regain control of her body, but Ms. Marvel fought back, having determined that the threat of the Elementals was more pressing than Salia's life. When Ms. Marvel managed to get hold of the scarab, she turned back into Carol Danvers, and she lashed out against Hecate, blaming her for the incident that forced her to turn her back on her friend.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 12}}

Hecate made Carol notice that she was displaying Ms. Marvel's superhuman strength, causing her to realize that she was intrinsically Ms. Marvel beyond the personality change. Carol consolidated her two personalities, gaining the ability to change into her identity of Ms. Marvel without changing personality. Feeling at peace, Carol took Barnett to visit her mother in Boston and thereafter they went on a date. However, their engagement was disrupted by [[Osinga Rplss (Earth-616)|Sapper]] and [[Zacharaiah Seavey (Earth-616)|Golden-Blade]].{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 13}} Next, Carol saved her father after his dispute with [[Maxwell Plumm (Earth-616)|Steeplejack]] escalated, as a result of Joe discovering budget-cuts with the [[Monarch Plaza]] project. Afterward, Carol's mother saw through her disguise and told her to give her father another chance despite their difficult history.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 14}}

During this time, Geoffrey Ballard had broken into Carol's office.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 14}} Gianelli omitted information when [[Jean DeWolff (Earth-616)|Jean DeWolff]] interviewed him about the burglary and suspected he knew the thief. He admitted to Carol and Tracy he knew Ballard; he was a former big-shot in the CIA. Gianelli went to Washington to dig for information.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 15}} After her previous apartment was unlivable due to the bombing, she sought a new home in New York after temporarily residing in a hotel.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 11}} Eventually she accepted an offer from [[Arabella Jones (Earth-616)|Arabella Jones]] and got herself a new home in [[Greenwich Village]].{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 15|16}}

[[File:Ms. Marvel Vol 1 17.jpg|thumb|200px|left]]
While she slept, Carol had a premonition that devolved into a nightmare about her own apparent death, it made her more stressed than usual. While at work, Gianelli returned from Washington empty-handed, consequently Carol canceled his assignment. Her colleagues, remarking how overworked and stressed Carol was, so they decided to cheer her up by initiating a snowball fight. Meanwhile, on a high-security S.H.I.E.L.D air-carrier, Geoffrey Ballard and [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] broke into the Centurion project, to steal a classified weapon and assassinate Ms. Marvel. Following the snowball fight, she and Gianelli had an intimate moment and shared a brief kiss. Afterward, whilst flying home in her superhero suit, she was shot out of the sky by Centurion.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 17}} 

But before the assailant could execute her, she was saved by the Avengers. As the battle raged across Manhattan, Mystique observed the action from an office in the [[Pentagon]], she was contacted by her superiors urging to cease the assault on Ms. Marvel, they couldn't permit more failures, as it increased the risk of their discovery. She heeded their words but was still determined to execute her plan. Ms. Marvel defeated Centurion and unmasked him; she realized that the battle was won, but their war had just begun.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 18}} 

During a writing session, she got a short vision of her being in [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supremor]]'s chamber on [[Kree-Lar (Planet)|Kree-Lar]]. Immediately next, [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan the Accuser]] tried to apprehend her for transgressions she supposedly committed against the Kree. Their battle was interrupted by Mar-Vell. Both were knocked out after he recognized Danvers and they had a lapse of concentration. On a Kree starship, Supremor wanted to use Carol's combined genetics, to birth a new Kree race. By using the [[Millennia Bloom]], it tried to expunge her humanity and use her Kree part as a mold to create a new and improved Kree race. Only the machine had no effect on Carol as her soul was whole and thus inseparable. After the probe was done, they both free themselves and return to Earth. When they arrived back on Terra, the two reconciled and agreed to stay friends.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 19}} 

===The Korvac Saga===
The first time she accompanied the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] was when they were searching for [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]]. After she perceived them in danger in a precognitive flash,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 171}} she wanted to return the favor after she borrowed their laboratory to create an oxygen mask,{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 16}} they hesitantly agreed. They tracked Jocasta down to a convent, where her [[Ultron (Earth-616)|creator]] resided. Together with the Avengers, they defeated Ultron and shot him into orbit. In the aftermath, they were left puzzled when Jocasta and Captain America mysteriously vanished.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 171}}

In view of the sudden disappearances, Carol briefly remained with the Avengers. Back at the mansion, they were rejoined by [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], who mistakenly captured Gyrich, confusing him for an intruder. An enraged Gyrich severed all their government ties and revoked their special privileges. Later on, they split into teams in order to respond to ongoing crises and Iron Man looked into the disappearances of [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], [[Matthew Hawk (Earth-616)|Two-Gun Kid]], among others. After Ms. Marvel's team defeated [[Tyrak (Earth-616)|Tyrak]], she briefly flirted with [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] and left for personal business but remained on standby. All the superheroes that vanished, were being held by the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]] on his ship.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 172}}

[[File:Carol Danvers (Earth-616) from Ms. Marvel Vol 1 20 001.jpg|Her New Costume|thumb|200px|right]]
The Avengers returned to their mansion, they gathered their wits after they escaped the clutches of the Collector. He was disintegrated from across space by the godlike being [[Michael Korvac (Earth-691)|Korvac]], after he found out that [[Carina Tivan (Earth-616)|his wife]] was sent by the Collector as a ploy to reveal his true intentions. But, her false feelings became true and she betrayed her father.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 174|175}}

Carol, along with the psychic-sensitive Avengers, tried locating their unknown enemy but to no avail.
Stark contacted [[Stakar Ogord (Earth-691)|Starhawk]] of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-691)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], however, he was unable to perceive Korvac. Eventually, Carol, the Avengers, and Guardians of the Galaxy fed data about cosmic disturbances (committed by Korvac in preparation for godhood) into their computers, that centered around [[Forest Hills]]. They located Korvac and Carina, who posed as a middle-class couple. Korvac's deception was exposed when Starhawk was unable to detect him.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 175|176}} 

After Korvac defeated wave after wave of Avengers and Guardians, the remaining heroes combined their capabilities and managed to kill him. In a moment of weakness, Carina used her [[Power Cosmic|powers]] to kill him. Following a quick fight with Carina, she committed suicide. But before Korvac died, he regretted killing [[Nicholette Gold (Earth-691)|Nikki]], and used his powers to restore the Avengers' lives.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 177}}

===A New Costume & Losing Employment===
In a collaboration with fellow superhero and fashion designer at the time, [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Janet van Dyne]], they created a new black-yellow costume using unstable molecules. On her day off, she traveled with haste to [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]] after receiving an emergency visit concerning the disappearance of fellow reporter [[Sharon Cole (Earth-616)|Sharon Cole]], who was taken by [[Saurians|the Lizard People]]. During her investigation into a group of disappearances, Carol was ambushed, after a quick but intense fight and brief verbal exchange, she was zapped unconscious and taken to their underground city.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 20}}

[[File:Carol Danvers (Earth-616) from Ms. Marvel Vol 1 22 001.jpg|Carol's layoff letter|thumb|200px|left]]
Waking up in a prison cell, she found the rest of the missing people including Cole. After killing their [[Guardian (Lizard People) (Earth-616)|greatest warrior]], all the prisoners were let go in exchange for their own existence being kept a secret. Returning home she received a present that contained a baby iguana as a token of gratitude.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 21}} Following her return at Woman Magazine, she was removed as editor by her boss and publisher J. Jonah Jameson. Over the course of her tenure, the duo would regularly clash regarding the content of the magazine, over-budgeting, and her frequent absences as a consequence of her burgeoning career as Ms. Marvel. Burke was appointed as her replacement.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 22}}

Carol came home to a surprise party, thrown by her old colleagues and friends. Among the guests, was a disguised Mystique waiting for her moment to strike.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 22}} When she returned from a date with [[Sam Adams (Earth-616)|Sam Adams]], she was visited by her not quite dead friend, Salia Petrie. Petrie, who was under the mental control of the [[Faceless One (Earth-616)|Faceless One]], transported them to the [[Drydock]]. With the aid of [[Vance Astro (Earth-691)|Vance Astro]], they defeated him and Carol revealed her identity to a frightened Petrie.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 23}} She established herself as one of New York's premiere superheroes working with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] and the Avengers.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 1 62}}{{r|Defenders Vol 1 57}}{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 8}}

===Joining the Avengers===
Ms. Marvel was invited to join the team during the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]'s leave of absence. Carol was accepted as a temporary replacement, she was subjected to rigorous security procedures, who were recently implemented by the [[National Security Council]], which included a retinal scan, voice recordings and the team had now a size limit of seven. Following her initiation, she was shown to her own quarters in the [[Avengers Mansion]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 183}}

[[File:Carol Danvers (Earth-616) and Henry Gyrich (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 183 001.jpg|New procedures|thumb|200px|right]]
She quickly established herself as a valuable member, as a member of the Avengers they prevented [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]] from leaving the United States,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 183|184}} rescued the Maximoff twins from an [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Elder God]], who had possessed Wanda during a family visit in [[Transia]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 186|187}} Defeated and buried a group of hostile elementals in a Russian nuclear reactor.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 188}}

Carol's stay with the Avengers was extended, thanks to Scarlet Witch prolonging her leave of absence. However, Gyrich fed up with the Avengers’ obstinate behavior, he vowed to shut them down.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 189}} He arranged a senate hearing, arguing that the superhero team were a security threat and demanded their disbandment. Only their trial was derailed by the [[Paul Duval (Earth-616)|Grey Gargoyle]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 190}} By defeating him, they reaffirmed the Senate’s trust in the Avengers and considered their concern for public safety genuine, their special privileges and security remained intact.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 191}} 

The team had extricated themselves from Gyrich’s total control. But before they could bring back former members back in the fold, they had to respond to an emergency in [[Pittsburgh]] at a local [[Damascus Steel|foundry]], that was previously owned by Wonder Man, that [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] was interested in purchasing.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 192|193}} Afterwards, Wonder Man was reinstated as an Avenger and the [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] left team knowing government quota no longer existed and he felt out of place in the team.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 194}}

===A Gruesome Murder & a Bizarre Pregnancy===
With the help of [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]], they rescued Wasp and shut down the operations of the [[Solomon Institute for the Criminally Insane]], which was a front for a training academy helmed by [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 195|196}} Following the murder of Barnett in his own office,{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes Vol 2 10}} Carol and fellow Avenger Iron Man, investigated the crime scene with a heat image inducer, it revealed how Mystique gruesomely murdered the psychiatrist.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes Vol 2 11}}

Carol privately continued her investigation, which eventually brought her in conflict with Mystique's [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. After [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny]] received possible future, in which Ms. Marvel would kill [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]]. Mystique sent out [[Dominikos Petrakis (Earth-616)|Avalanche]] and [[St. John Allerdyce (Earth-616)|Pyro]] to kill Carol, whose investigation led her to [[Hong Kong]], where the Brotherhood was located. The duo failed in their mission; at some point, Carol's search for Mystique reached a dead end and Destiny was unable to perceive Carol in any of their possible futures.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes Vol 2 11}}

[[File:Carol Danvers (Earth-616) and Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 197 001.jpg|Unwanted pregnancy|thumb|200px|left]]
When she visited Scarlet Witch in [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]], Carol fell unexpectedly ill. She was rushed to a local hospital, where it was discovered she was three months pregnant. She left the team following the bizarre unwanted pregnancy,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 197}} which progressed rapidly over the subsequent days, right before she was about to give birth, she revealed her secret identity to the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 198|199}}

The pregnancy was caused by "[[Marcus Immortus (Temporal Limbo)|Marcus]]", who claimed to be the son of [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]]. Marcus manipulated Carol into believing that she loved him and took her to his home in [[Limbo (Temporal)|Limbo]];{{r|Avengers Vol 1 200}} however, Marcus' plot backfired when he discovered that he aged at an accelerated rate in Limbo. Carol learned how to use Immortus' time-traveling technology and returned to her time. Upon her return, she angrily confronted the Avengers, expressing her resentment towards them for falling for Marcus' lies and manipulation of her, allowing him to effectively kidnap her for future defilement at his hands.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 10}}

===Losing her Powers & Meeting the X-Men===
Seeking peace of mind after her ordeal with Marcus, Carol relocated to [[San Francisco]] and chose not to resume ties with the Avengers. In a battle with the power-absorbing mutant [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], Danvers lost virtually all of her Ms. Marvel abilities,{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes Vol 2 11}} leaving her with only her augmented genetic structure. Rogue attempted to murder her straight after by throwing her off the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. However, Carol was rescued by [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]] who was able to catch her before impact, but found she could not stay aloft with Carol's added weight, and both plunged into the water, forcing Spider-Woman to swim to shore with the unconscious Carol. Spider-Woman then alerted the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] to Carol's plight upon learning that Carol's mind had become a tabula rasa. Rogue had drained her memories, most of which were restored by mutant telepath [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]]. However, Professor X could not return the emotional bonds linked to those memories.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 10}}

During this period, Carol was a frequent ally of the X-Men - Xavier's team of masked, mutant heroes. In the [[Bermuda Triangle]] on her first mission with the mutants, Carol was on a yacht with [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]], [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]], and [[Peter Corbeau (Earth-616)|Dr. Peter Corbeau]], they were searching for the previous X-Men leader [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] who went missing at sea. During their search, Professor X suddenly lost telepathic contact with the rest of the X-Men. When Carol spotted [[Island M|Magneto's Island]], Professor X was on the astral plane confronting [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]. Magneto defeated Professor X by bringing his physical body into his inhibitor field with his magnetic powers, Carol and the rest of the crew were left behind on the damaged yacht. The X-Men including Cyclops managed to hold off Magneto, who abandoned the battle after almost killing [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Sprite]]. Afterward, Corbeau, Nightcrawler and Carol repaired the ship.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 150}} 

After a failed assault from the [[Hellfire Club]], the X-Men cleaned and repaired their [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|X-Mansion]] and Carol ministered them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 153}} Carol joined the X-Men at Magneto's old base in the Bermuda Triangle, to set up a new secret base. In her room, she was soul searching and reflecting on the event where she lost her powers. Logan tried to comfort her by talking about their shared past, only to much exasperation she couldn't remember any of it.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #154}} 
[[File:Carol Danvers (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 158 001.jpg|thumb|200x|left|Carol deleting her files]]
Later, Carol and the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]] spar in a morning exercise, despite her loss of powers she was physical in superb form and she was only beaten when they ganged upon her. It was revealed in an examination performed by Corbeau, that when she gained superpowers her genetic structure was permanently altered, she remained a perfect specimen despite being stripped of her powers. After watching Senator Robert Kelly demonizing the X-Men on a talk show. In response, Carol, Storm and Wolverine infiltrated the [[Pentagon]], to destroy all the records about the X-Men, dressed as military personnel, Carol used her clout to act temporarily as a colonel. When they walked towards the data banks, they ran into Rogue. Carol was furious by being reminded of their terrible meeting, she tried to shoot Rogue, but Rogue had temporarily absorbed Wolverine's powers and in response, Storm used her powers to escape the situation. 

While the X-Men continued to fight Rogue, Carol had slipped away and gained access to the vault, only to be followed by a disguised [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], who entered the vault as Nick Fury and tried to kill her. Carol managed to defeat Mystique before she could upload a virus, she left the shape-shifter unconscious. She found two old personnel files of her, which she promptly deleted, knowing she was a different person without those memories. She also deleted the X-Men files. They all left the building quietly.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #158}}

===Becoming Binary===
Carol was at a farewell banquet with the X-Men onboard the [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]] flagship, but all of a sudden Lilandra went catatonic. [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]] suddenly appeared taunting her and proclaimed herself to be the new Empress. She then detonated a bomb which rendered the X-Men unconscious, and her [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] allies captured Carol and the X-Men to turn them into host-forms.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 161}}

[[File:Black Panther Vol 7 3 Carol Danvers 50th Anniversary Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|Carol Danvers as Binary|left]]
The Brood subjected her to an evolutionary ray that triggered the latent potential of her augmented genes and revealed that she had a psychic resilience that surprised them. Nearby, Wolverine had freed himself, smelled Carol's scent, found the lab she was kept and he freed her by smashing everything in sight. She was mostly in order, but she was surprised how energized she felt. After they reconvened with the rest of the X-Men and found Lilandra, they reached [[Z'Reee Shar (Vehicle)|Z'Reee Shar, Lilandra's yacht]] and left.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 163}} 

When they were eluding the brood, Carol became the cosmically powered mutate called Binary. She used her newfound powers to restart the anti-matter drive. She gained the power of a white hole and was able to generate heat, light, radiation, and access all other forms of energy along the electromagnetic spectrum on an almost solar scale. Shortly after, [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] asked Carol to join the X-Men but she declined, knowing she could finally travel space and didn't wanted to be confined on earth.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 164}} In a moment of respite, Wolverine finally told the rest of the team that the brood had implanted eggs in their nervous systems to transform them and use their genetic potential. His own healing factor barely saved his life. Carol, with a cry of rage, activated her Binary powers and blasted off into space.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 162}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 164}}

[[File:Carol Danvers (Earth-616) and Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 164 001.jpg|thumb|Colossus asks Binary to join the X-Men|right]]
Carol flew to a Brood base on [[Madrizar]], where she used her overwhelming power to enact revenge, she demolished their entire world except for the enslaved [[Acanti]]. Regrettably, the Acanti couldn't be saved and was put out of her misery. Following the destruction, she found Storm who had bonded with an [[Prophet-Singer (Earth-616)|Acanti]]. When Carol and the X-Men reunited, the Acanti explained the history between them and the Brood. Acanti sought help from the X-Men, if they relieved the racial soul of the old prophet-singer body, who was on Sleazeworld, his successor would be able to bring his people to safety. Meanwhile, the X-Men gained access, in space, the enemy numbers began to take their toll, and Carol was overwhelmed and neutralized. Fortunately, moments later the [[Starjammer (Shi'ar)|Starjammer]] came to the rescue when it dropped out of hyperspace.

Later, when Carol found the X-Men in a crystalline chamber wounded and about turned into Brood, she used her solar affinity to distill the soul-essence from the chamber and returned the Acanti young prophet-singer and killing all the embryos. They were all teleported to Starjammer and Sleazeworld was left in ruins. However, Wolverine realized that the Queen claimed there was an embryo which imperiled Earth - and that could only be Charles Xavier.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 166}} On Earth, they defeated the remaining Brood and Charles's mind was put in a new body with the help of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 167}}

===Starjammers===
Carol visited her parents in [[Beverly]], but despite Professor X's best efforts to restore her memory she still felt empty around them. She decided her life as Carol was over, she would live on as Binary instead. Later, she entered the X-Mansion on seeing Rogue she knocks her into orbit. After a quick scuffle, Xavier told her Rogue was under their protection as their newest member. Carol conceded understanding but not approval and left.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 171}}

[[File:Carol Danvers (Earth-616), Scott Summers (Earth-616) and Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 174 001.png|thumb|200px|left|Binary joining the Starjammers]]
No longer possessed of strong emotional ties to people and places on Earth, Carol decided to leave the planet and pursue new challenges as a member of the space-faring band of adventurers known as the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 174}} Binary was an attendee at the marriage of Scott Summers and Madelyne Pryor.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 175}} Before she would leave for the stars, she dropped by the Avengers mansion for a surprise game of [[Floating Super-Hero Poker Game|poker]]. Their game was cut short by latecomer and successor of the Captain Marvel title, [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Monica Rambeau]]. Binary was informed of Mar-Vell's lost battle with cancer. She said her final goodbyes to Logan and rushed to [[Titan (Moon of Saturn)|Titan]], to pay her last respects to her former comrade and friend.{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 24}}

While traveling through [[Shi'ar Galaxy|Shi'ar Space]] aboard the [[Starjammer (Shi'ar)|Starjammer]], their main scanner detected a [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|living entity]] going through space in the direction of the [[Earth]], that equaled the Starjammer in terms of potential energy. It was being followed by an even larger [[Magus (Technarch) (Earth-616)|energy signature]]. Realizing that were unable to pursue them, they decided to wait and avenge their friends and family, in case something happened to them.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 19}} 

The Starjammers eventually, but briefly, returned to Earth via a remote and undefended Shi'ar [[Stargate]], which was solely powered by Binary, to pick up, Professor X, who was terminally ill. [[Sikorsky (Earth-616)|Sikorsky]], using Shi'ar technology, restored the professor to full health. On the other hand, The starship wasn't as fortunate, in their escape from the [[Shi'ar Empire]], the ship was severely damaged and was barely holding on. the spacecraft was in dire need of heavy-duty repairs and was unable to use its stardrive. Unable to go home, the mutant stayed with the team and left Magneto in charge of his [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|school]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 200|201}}

[[File:New Mutants Vol 1 51.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Binary together with the New Mutants]]
Stranded and wanted by the [[Shi'ar Empire|Shi’ar Imperium]], they sought the services of a local merchant, that would arrange a deal with a nearby shipyard to restore their ship in its entirety. On the other side of the bazaar, they rescued one of Xavier’s students, Magik, from a nearby slave den. Before they were arrested, they beamed themselves back to their starskimmer and brought Magik to the infirmary. Once recovered, Illyana informed them of their recent activities and the New Mutants' current predicament.

Using Magik’s teleportation powers, they fetched the rest of her team from various alternate futures. Upon their return to the Starjammer, they were ambushed by Magus, Warlock’s father. By uniting their forces, they defeated the technarch.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 50}} Their battle caused an untold amount of damage, however, including the local world and its shipyard being utterly destroyed. Despite all these setbacks, with the aid of the young mutants, they patched up their ship. Having considered his options, Xavier sent the New Mutants home knowing they would be in safe hands and stayed with the starfaring team. Seconds later, a Shi’ar fast hunter group closed in on their location.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 51}}

===Genosha===
While Carol's body was in space her memories began exerting itself within Rogue's body, when Rogue and Wolverine are taken by the [[Press Gang (Earth-616)|Press Gang]] and teleported to the nation-state of [[Genosha]] for examination (the republic kept mutant slaves). In their attempted escape, they managed to get out of the extraction room, but in the next room, the mutant called [[Wipeout (Earth-616)|Wipeout]] nullified their powers and they were thrown in prison. Rogue was left in a catatonic state after the prison guard tried to assault her, she retreated in her own subconscious and found traces of the psyches of all those who she had touched when her powers were still active. She met the psyche of Carol, who asked Rogue to let her take over her body.

[[File:Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616) and Carol Danvers (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 236 001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Rogue meeting Carol's psyche]]
Having taken control of Rogue's body she beat two [[Magistrates (Earth-616)|Magistrates]] who came in her cell. When checking up on a wounded Logan, he recognized Carol's personality, Logan told her to leave him, but she refused to do so after he saved her from the KGB many years earlier. While disguising themselves as guards, they realized that [[Jennifer Ransome (Earth-616)|Jenny Ransome]] and [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]] cells were empty, knowing that they couldn't linger, they sneaked out of their cell block. When moving around the Citadel, they decided to escape out of Genosha in an aircraft, fighting their way through guards and stealing one they made a clean getaway.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 236}}

They booby-trapped and ditched the aircraft and let it fly across the [[Indian Ocean]], however, the Magistrates figured out the mutants were still on Genosha soil. the duo's powers were still nullified and thus were invisible to the Genosha's scanners. They reunited in the streets of [[Hammer Bay]], where they watched a promotional video that revealed that mutants were kept as slaves by the human population. Carol concluded that they needed new security passes, knowing that the old ones weren't usable anymore. As they entered a bar full of Magistrates, they noticed [[Phillip Moreau]] (the fiancée of Jenny Ransome) drinking his sorrows away and the Magistrates tried to goad him into a fight. Logan used it as an opportunity to escalate the fight into a full-on bar brawl. In the middle of the fight, Logan and Carol grabbed as many security passes as they could and high tailed out of the bar.

Nevertheless, Phillip was recognized by the Magistrates as the [[David Moreau (Earth-616)|Gengineer]]'s son and they threw him in the next "Mute Train" to teach him a lesson. Deciding that he might be useful, they also boarded the mutant-powered train. Aboard the Mute Train, Carol discovered that Logan was bleeding when he used his claws, these wounds would be fatal if they weren't treated. Next, they found Moreau among the Mutates and escaped the train by passing themselves off as humans. When Logan and Carol carried Moreau to a jeep, Logan vowed to bring the whole country down after witnessing the mutant slaves on the train.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 237}}

They traveled to the Highlands and showed Moreau the gruesome reality of the camp where the mutant slaves were kept, he was shocked by the revelations. They were captured by the Magistrates, who got word on Moreau's location. The Magistrates brought them to [[David Moreau (Earth-616)|David Moreau]]. When they were being interrogated by Moreau, the rest of the X-Men broke in the Citadel, rescued their teammates and freed all the prisoners, Madelyne Pryor included. [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] restored Rogue's and Wolverine's mutant powers. The X-Men warned the Magistrates that should they not change their treatment of mutants, they would be back. Havok showed what the X-Men meant by using his powers to raze the Citadel. The X-Men left Genosha, and convinced Phillip and Jenny to leave with them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 238}}

===Australian Outback & Rogue Redux===
Back at the [[Cooterman's Creek|X-Men outback hideout]], in an underground cave, Psylocke fought Rogue and Colossus in a training session. During the fight Rogue got knocked out, this instantly allowed Carol to take control of Rogue's body. Unlike Rogue, she was able to touch Psylocke without any power drain.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 239}} Later back in Australia, Rogue caused friction with her teammates because of her fury at sharing her own mind with Carol, who had redecorated her room. Carol was forced to take back control when the tension rose to a breaking point. [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]] suggested a girls' night out to ease the tension, Gateway teleported the X-Women to the Hollywood Mall. During their trip, they found a [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|young mutant]] being attacked by the anti-mutant group [[M-Squad (Earth-616)|M-Squad]]. After dispatching the Squad, the four X-ladies returned through Gateway's portal, unaware that Jubilee had followed them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 244}}

Later in Washington D.C. Carol visited the Vietnam War Memorial to mourn and honor her brother Steve, who was lost in action. After she visited her old apartment in the [[West Village]], she was followed by Psylocke. The two have a conversation about Carol's frustrations with being trapped in Rogue's mind. Nearby, [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] fused with [[Master Mold (Earth-616)|Master Mold]] and Carol attacked it while wearing her old Ms. Marvel uniform, only to be knocked out and lose control again.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 246}} During the fight with Nimrod, Dazzler used the [[Siege Perilous]] to teleport it away. Rogue, sensing Dazzler's plan, used her powers to push the Sentinel through the portal, but not without being dragged inside with it.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 247}}

After going through the [[Siege Perilous]] Rogue and Carol were physically split (with Rogue only having her base powers and Carol retaining her powers). [[Gateway (Earth-616)|Gateway]] teleported the two away from the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]] with Rogue ending up in the [[Savage Land]] and Carol on [[Muir Island]]. The [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] took control of Carol and sent her after Rogue. Carol was decomposing as there was only enough life energy to sustain one person. As Carol started winning Rogue began decomposing. However the fight ended with Carol's death due to [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] interfering on Rogue's behalf.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 269}}

===Phalkon Quest===
The Starjammers still continuing their rebellion against Deathbird, Lilandra's sister who had led a successful coup d'etat against Lilandra and usurped the Shi’ar throne. They were raiding an alien storage freighter on the edge of Shi’ar space for supplies. By accident, they discover that Deathbird is searching for a map that held the location of a Shi’ar myth called the ”Phalkon”,{{r|X-Men: Spotlight on...Starjammers Vol 1 1}} which in the end was revealed to be the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]], at the time held by [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]].{{r|X-Men: Spotlight on...Starjammers Vol 1 2}} They split up in order to find the four missing pieces of the map, which were spread around Shi’ar space. Binary and [[Raza Longknife (Earth-616)|Raza]] for their part, retrieve theirs from an insectoid swamped planet named [[Ch’’rp]], despite their disagreements on how to proceed. When they returned to Starjammer, the space pirates were blindsided by an ambush by Deathbird and her subordinates.{{r|X-Men: Spotlight on...Starjammers Vol 1 1}}

Despite mounting a relatively strong counter-attack, Deathbird managed to grab Lilandra and teleported herself and Lilandra away.{{r|X-Men: Spotlight on...Starjammers Vol 1 1}} The Starjammers swiftly retaliated by outmaneuvering the defenses of the Shi’ar command ship and boarded her spacecraft. After a failed attempt to negotiate, taking matters in her own head, a vengeance fueled Lilandra almost stabbed her sister, however, everyone was caught off guard by the Shi’ar [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]] who just showed up. Binary distracted the newly arrived squad, by blowing a hole in the spacecraft, which allowed her teammates to beam Lilandra to safety on a Starskimmer.
[[File:X-Men Spotlight on Starjammers Vol 1 2.jpg|thumb|right|Phalkon Quest]]
Soon afterward unbeknownst to Starjammers, the Shi’ar were on the Starjammer in search of the map-data, the pirates returned to the ship and defeated the Imperial Guard that were waiting for them, but not before Deathbird took the only copy of the charts with her. Binary applied her powers to recharge the Starjammer, which allowed them to chase their foes; their hot pursuit brought them back to Earth. During this extensive voyage, Binary lamented that she didn’t get enough chances to test her mettle against other powerful beings and considered her current team a “two-bit outfit”, which caused friction in the team. Corsair was already dissatisfied with her attitude in general.

When they arrived in Earth’s Orbit, the Imperial Armada was already stationed there. By activating their cloak, they easily bypassed the fleet and arrived at a Shi’ar Warwhip in the North Atlantic, only to find a cocoon with Phoenix in it and a group of unconscious Shi’ar, that were knocked out by Phoenix’s [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] teammates. The tension ran high and the teams had a brief scramble, but they dropped hostilities when the Imperial Guard attacked. Together they defeated the royal guard and stopped Deathbird's last-ditch effort to harness the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]]; however, before Lilandra could give her sister a reckoning, [[Black Light (Earth-616)|Black Light]] saved his mother.

Months later, in the outskirts of the Shi’ar Galaxy, The Starjammers reinvigorated the revolution with the Phoenix symbol as a rallying cry against the current regime. During their insurrection, Binary felt her power weakening, even after months, she wasn’t fully recovered from her recharging the Starjammer; but she continued fighting for the rebellion alongside her allies anyway.{{r|X-Men: Spotlight on...Starjammers Vol 1 2}}

===Rejoining the Avengers===
Returning to Earth some years later, Carol exhausted her cosmic energies to save the sun. Her powers severely depleted, she spent months recuperating at [[Avengers Mansion]]. Now known as Warbird, she eventually rejoined the team. Carol overcame emotional emptiness, alcoholism, substantially reduced power levels, and a formal court-martial before her teammates to prove herself as an asset among Avengers. She proved herself on many missions and was instrumental in defeating the time-spanning [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Kang]] during the Kang Wars as a result of his son, [[Marcus Kang (Earth-6311)|Marcus Kang XXIII]]'s attraction to her.{{citation}} Carol stayed to help on a few more missions and even donned a new costume, but eventually left to work for the [[United States Department of Homeland Security (Earth-616)|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] where she was offered a high rank in one of the agencies.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 70}}

===[[House of M]]===
She was one of many Avengers who opposed the Scarlet Witch during her breakdown{{r|Avengers Disassembled}} and remained with them until they officially disbanded. A short time later, Carol found herself working alongside the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers 15}} While [[Earth-616]] was merged with the [[Earth-58163|House of M reality]], Carol experienced being the greatest, most popular hero on Earth, though she was only a 'Sapien' operating under the rule of mutants.{{r|House of M Vol 1 2}} Magneto dubbed her as ''Captain Marvel'' after winning the Mutant-Human war.{{r|Civil War: House of M Vol 1 5}}

As Captain Marvel, she tracked down [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-58163)|a thief]] and fought a mystic named [[Warren Traveler (Earth-58163)|Warren Traveler]] before being 'awakened' by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] and [[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|Layla Miller]]. From there she joined the other heroes in their successful attempt to revert their reality.{{r|House of M Vol 1 5}}

Her House of M experience made her realize she wasn't living up to her full potential, thus embarking on becoming the hero she now knew she could be by being more proactive with her superhero career.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 1}}

===Leader of the Mighty Avengers===
Carol sided with Iron Man and the [[Superhuman Registration Act|Registration Act]] during the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]]. She and [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] worked together in several capacities, such as chasing [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Julia Carpenter]], a previous Spider-Woman, and the recruitment of the young [[Anya Corazon (Earth-616)|Araña]].{{r|{{cl|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 6}}-[[Ms. Marvel Vol 2 8|8]]}} After the war, she was given leadership over the [[Mighty Avengers (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]], the New York branch of the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|50-State Initiative]].{{r|Mighty Avengers #1}} Carol aided her fellow Mighty Avengers Iron Man, [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]], and Wonder Man when they tried to stop the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] and his [[Warbound (Earth-616)|Warbound]].{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 2}} She also convinced Iron Man to let her have a [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] mini-carrier and be in charge of her own unit, [[Operation: Lightning Storm (Earth-616)|Operation: Lightning Storm]].{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 #13}} They faced [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] and [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]], amongst others.{{r|{{cl|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 15}}-[[Ms. Marvel Vol 2 17|17]]}} Ms. Marvel was captured by the Brood on [[Monster Isle|Monster Island]], whereupon she faced the Brood Queen.{{r|{{cl|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 21}}-[[Ms. Marvel Vol 2 24|24]]}}

===Secret Invasion===
During this time a second [[Carol Danvers (Modern, Skrull) (Earth-616)|Carol]] made an appearance, this one was a [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrull]] in disguise who killed [[William Wagner (Earth-616)|William Wagner]], Carol's secretly Kree boyfriend, a crime which Carol came under suspicion of. Carol fled the scene of the murder and fought her own Operation: Lightning Storm colleagues, and the Skrull impersonating her. Both Carol's were arrested and another [[Rl'nnd (Earth-616)|Skrull]], with the powers of the X-Men, attacked the minicarrier and was killed by Carol at which point the other Skrull revealed itself for what it truly was. Carol briefly believed the Skrull when it claimed that William was still alive only for this to be a trick, as Carol beat the Skrull for tricking her it blew itself up.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 25|27}}

Carol accompanied the rest of the Mighty Avengers to the [[Savage Land]] when a Skrull ship was tracked there. The ship contained [[Savage Land Skrulls (Earth-616)|past versions of various heroes]], who believed themselves to truly be human prisoners escaped from the Skrulls. When Tony Stark came under attack from a virus that shut his armor down he realised the gravity of the situation and sent Carol back to New York to warn others about what was happening, as well as to gather reinforcements.{{r|{{cl|Secret Invasion Vol 1 1}}-[[Secret Invasion Vol 1 2|2]]}} Carol then took to the streets of New York, enjoying fighting the Skrulls until they began assuming human form and blending in with crowds to try and stop her. Carol used low level energy blasts to expose the Skrulls and continued the fight.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 28}}

During the chaotic Battle of [[Manhattan]] during the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]], Ms. Marvel was shot down by [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]], who was unconvinced that she was the real Carol Danvers.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 4}} She recovered and fought bravely, killing many Skrulls and several [[Super-Skrulls (Earth-616)|Super-Skrulls]], while saving as many people as she could before leading the Skrulls away from a group of survivors being driven by [[Hui Lin (Earth-616)|Agent Sum]] to the [[Raft]] for safety.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 29}} After arriving at the Raft Carol fought an enraged [[Hydra Prime 001 (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]], with a large roster of powers, until the Skrull collapsed from exhaustion.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 30}}

===New Avengers===
In the aftermath of the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], the entire original roster of the Mighty Avengers left the team, and Carol was no exception. Since S.H.I.E.L.D. was simultaneously disbanded, she was left without a job, and rather than stay solo, she joined the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]]. She adamantly refused to join [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|team of Avengers]]. Officially, taking her place as Ms. Marvel on the Dark Avengers was [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Karla Sofen]], aka Moonstone.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Carol Danvers (Earth-616) from Ms. Marvel Vol 2 46 001.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Ms. Marvel]]
Later, Osborn attempted to assassinate Danvers, planning to make Sofen the sole Ms. Marvel. But Danvers was split into four energy beings, who used baby MODOKs to reconstitute herself. However, she had a separate alter ego named Catherine Donovan, who in proximity to each other, would allow Danvers to increase in strength. Donovan was created by the [[Storyteller (Gavin) (Earth-616)|Storyteller]] in an attempt to give her now the greatest desire of being free from her burdens. Eventually, Donovan was killed by Norman Osborn and fused with Moonstone. After a great realization, Karla was able to will out Donovan from her mind thus completely merging Donovan and Carol together. During her fight with Karla, Carol removed the moonstone from Karla's body leaving her powerless. Seeing Karla powerless and lost, Carol decided to give Karla back the Moonstone if she were able to redeem herself.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 34|46}}

Following the [[Siege (Event)|Siege]] of [[Asgard]], Ms. Marvel remained a member of the New Avengers, and even admitted to being attracted to her fellow teammate Spider-Man.{{r|Siege: Spider-Man Vol 1 1}} When the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]] attacked the Earth, Ms. Marvel, along with Spider-Woman and [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Noh-Varr]], went to confront the Hulk, who had become [[Nul (Earth-616)|Nul, Breaker of Worlds]].{{r|Fear Itself Vol 1 3}}

===War with the X-Men===
When it was realized that the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] was heading toward Earth, Ms. Marvel was part of the team sent to stall/take out the Phoenix Force if necessary at all costs.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 1}} She encountered a resurrected Captain Marvel, who was revived by the Kree Empire using the [[M'kraan Crystal]] in order to unite and protect all of the Kree against the Phoenix Force.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 26|28}}

[[File:Captain Marvel Vol 7 1 Textless.jpg|left|thumb|Carol as the new Captain Marvel]]
Mar-Vell along with all the other Kree and everyone powered by Kree energies were brainwashed into believing that the Phoenix would deliver their salvation. [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] managed to free Mar-Vell and the other Kree from the illusion but it was too late to evacuate the planet as the Phoenix drew ever closer to [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]]. Mar-Vell realized that the Phoenix was coming to claim the portion of its power that was used to resurrect him and still resided within him. He sacrificed himself to save Hala and the Phoenix departed for Earth. Carol realized what Mar-Vell meant for her and decided to take on his legacy, becoming the new Captain Marvel in the aftermath of the war against the X-Men.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 1}}

===The Enemy Within===
While investigating various plane disappearances with [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Monica Rambeau]], Carol absorbed her in energy state in order to destroy a giant robot. Back in New York, it was discovered that she had a brain lesion that would cause memory loss if she flew. While searching for her apparently disappeared friend [[Rose Rucklova (Earth-616)|Rose]] with Spider-Woman, Carol and Jessica were attacked by the [[Grapplers (Earth-616)|Grapplers]]. After defeating them (but flying in order to do it) one of them revealed her that Rose was in [[Central Park]]. When Carol arrived she and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] battled two T-Rex and found Rose and a note with her apartment's direction. When she arrived with Spider-Woman, they discovered that someone had stolen a piece of the Psyche-Magnitron.{{r|Avengers: The Enemy Within Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Captain Marvel Vol 8 6 Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]
A Brood ship suddenly appeared out of nowhere, and the Avengers, including Captain Marvel, battled them. Meanwhile, Yon-Rogg was revealed to be the one who had stolen the Psyche-Magnitron and solicited the Kree to transport it back to Hala. When they refused, he combined with the Psyche-Magnitron and claimed that he was going to reform Earth. The Avengers defeated the Brood but unknown to them a [[Kree Sentries|Kree Sentry]] appeared on Earth.{{r|Avengers Assemble Vol 2 16}} The Sentries projected an energy field around New York when Rogg used Danvers' brain as a power source amplified by the field to recreate a Kree city in New York's sky. The Avengers planned to use [[Captain America's Shield|Cap's shield]] to break the energy field, but Danvers instead flew to space to separate Rogg from his power source, which worked. Captain Marvel saved the city but suffered great brain damage in the process which cost her a big portion of her memories.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 14}}

After a brief stint in space, working with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in order to rediscover herself,{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 8 1}} Carol returned to Earth,{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 8 15}} and joined S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to hunt down the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}} Additionally, Carol started dating [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|Jim Rhodes]], a fellow former U.S. Air Force pilot known as the armored hero [[War Machine]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 8 1}}

===Secret Wars===
During the final incursion, Carol was one of the heroes that tried to stop Earth-1610 from destroying her Earth. After the vessel transporting the Earth's "resurrection team" was destroyed by the [[Children of Tomorrow (Earth-1610)|Children]], Mr. Fantastic was forced to put the "lifeboat" in action. As the "lifeboat" was deployed, Manifold teleported numerous heroes into it including Spider-Man, [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]], [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Thor]], and [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], and Carol herself, which allowed them to survive the end of the Multiverse.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 1}}

Carol and the other heroes transported onto the life raft were awakened by Doctor Strange eight years after the end of the multiverse and the creation of [[Battleworld (Latverion)|Battleworld]], a planet cobbled together by segments of destroyed realities created and ruled by Doctor Doom. Captain Marvel and the other heroes were later transported by Strange to confront the Cabal after a distress call was sent to him by one member of the Thor Corps, and after this Doom, himself appeared to quell the fighting. When Doom tried to kill them, Doctor Strange teleported them across Battleworld, but at the cost of his own life. She was teleported into the domain of [[Bar Sinister]], where [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-21919)|Mister Sinister]]'s clone army captured her and brought her to the original Mister Sinister, where he then corrupted her. Later on, after a conservation with God Emperor Doom, Sinister asked her for advice. When she punches him a few times, which he seems to draw pleasure from, he resolves to be "naughty", a course she approves of. During the final battle against Doom, Sinister was convinced by her to betray Doom and kill [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-91240)|Baroness Madelyne Pryor]], which led to the restoration of the Multiverse.{{r|{{cl|Secret Wars Vol 1 3}}-[[Secret Wars Vol 1 8|8]]}}

[[File:Captain Marvel Vol 9 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Carol as the head of Alpha Flight]]
Eight months later, Carol was subsequently recruited by the [[Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight Space Program]] to work as the commander of the [[Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station]], the Earth's first line of defense. During this time she also joined the [[Ultimates (Earth-616)|Ultimates]] and [[A-Force (Earth-616)|A-Force]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 9 1}}{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 1}}{{r|{{cl|A-Force Vol 2 1}}-[[A-Force Vol 2 4|4]]}}

===Civil War II===
Carol's ensuing adventures together with the Ultimates provided her with a look at the scope of the different threats that could endanger the Earth at any minute, causing her to develop an intense concern for the long-term well-being of the planet.{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 7}} Captain Marvel found a possible answer to her worries in the form of a newly-developed [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] called [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses Cain]] who possessed the power of precognition with an extreme degree of accuracy. Carol desired to use Ulysses' gift to preemptively tackle threats before they could even happen. However, her friend Tony Stark opposed the idea, doubting the efficacy of Ulysses' powers, and the morality behind using them to potentially convict people before committing the crime they would be prosecuted for.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 1}} Carol was further compelled to make use of Ulysses' visions after one of Alpha Flight's missions against [[Minn-Erva (Earth-616)|Dr. Minerva]] saw a number of civilians mutated and killed by an experimental weapon that had been deployed before they became aware of it.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 9 6}}

The tension between Carol and Tony increased after Carol's use of Ulysses resulted in tragedy in two different instances. First War Machine died and [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] was left in a coma following a preemptive ambush on [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]].{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 1}} Later [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] was killed by [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] after a vision foretold that Banner would cause a tragedy during a rampage as the [[Hulk]].{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 3}} 

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) vs. Carol Danvers (Earth-616) from Civil War II Vol 1 8 002.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Iron Man vs. Captain Marvel]]
After Captain Marvel arrested an innocent finance banker named [[Alison Green (Earth-616)|Alison Green]] based on nothing more than a vision from Ulysses that turned out to be wrong, Iron Man enlisted the help of several superheroes who opposed profiling to attack the [[Triskelion]] and rescue Green.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 4}} The ensuing battle between Iron Man's and Captain Marvel's forces was cut short when a new vision announced Captain America's death at the hands of the new [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Spider-Man]] on the steps of the [[Capitol Building]].{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 5}} [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] subsequently deflected Captain Marvel's side publicly, giving Iron Man and his allies enough time to teleport away.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 6}}

Iron Man and Captain Marvel came to blows one last time after both Spider-Man and Captain America traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] to prove the vision wrong.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 7}} Tony lost the fight and slipped into a coma. Meanwhile, Ulysses' powers had evolved beyond the ability of human comprehension, and he left the Earth to join other cosmic entities.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 8}}

===Secret Empire===
When S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] was discharged following a trial for her conduct, she evaded arrest to deliver Captain Marvel the plans for the [[Planetary Defense Shield]], an artificial force field capable of protecting the Earth from external threats.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 10}} Carol personally endorsed the creation of the Shield to the President of the United States,{{r|Civil War II: The Oath Vol 1 1}} and its generator was built in the following months.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 11}} However, the Shield's creation was a ploy by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America]], who had been secretly supplanted by a [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]-loyalist doppelganger.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}}

Captain America made a Chitauri invasion coincide with other incidents that allowed him to take power. When Captain Marvel was leading a team of Earth's heavy-hitters to fend off the swarm of aliens, Captain America used the Planetary Defense Shield to keep them stranded outside of the planet.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} Carol and her forces were attrited over the following months by ever-increasing hordes of Chitauri,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 3}} and saw themselves forced to sacrifice the Alpha Flight Space Station by making it explode in an attempt to breach the Shield. When the Shield was breached, Captain Marvel then joined the rest of Earth's heroes in opposing the fascist Captain America.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 8}} The ensuing battle saw the defeat of Hydra's forces and the return of the original Captain America.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}} In the aftermath of Hydra's attack, Alpha Flight's funding proved hard to maintain. With the loss of the station, Alpha Flight was placed on indefinite paid leave until reconstruction of the base was finished. With her loft in the Statue of Liberty destroyed during Hydra's takeover, Carol temporarily lived in Jessica Jones' apartment.{{r|Mighty Captain Marvel Vol 1 9}}

===Dark Origins===
While Alpha Flight was grounded, Carol was pulled into an [[Earth-25271|alternate reality]] by [[Doctor Eve (Earth-616)|Doctor Eve]] who was searching for the [[Reality Stone]]. In this reality [[Carol Danvers (Earth-25271)|Carol was a Corporal]] and the leader of [[Zeta Flight (Earth-25271)|Zeta Flight]], a group of space pirates. Carol had no choice but to assume her counterpart's identity,{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 126}} which brought her into conflict with [[Natasha Romanoff (Earth-25271)|Widower]] and the [[Ravagers (Earth-25271)|Ravagers]], a rival pirate gang led by her "nemesis" [[Peter Quill (Earth-25271)|Lord Starkill (Peter Quill)]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 127}} Carol was eventually captured and along with others taken to [[Thanos (Earth-25271)|Thanos]], who was a benevolent peacekeeper in this reality. Carol and the pirates were able to escape with the Reality Stone, at which point Doctor Eve revealed herself.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 128}} She kidnapped Carol and took her to this universe's [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]], where she planned to have [[Hala Child Nine (Earth-616)|Hala Child Nine]] possess Danvers' body and make her use the Reality Stone to bring this intact Hala to replace the destroyed Hala from the [[Earth-616|Prime Marvel Universe]]. Carol managed to stop the process and instead used the Reality Stone to return to her home universe.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 129}} 

Carol used the Reality Stone's ability to connect with her other selves from across the [[Multiverse]] and reflect on her history, acknowledging her past mistakes and reinforcing her sense of self.{{r|Infinity Countdown: Captain Marvel Vol 1 1}} Not long afterwards, when Carol was visiting her mother Marie and her brother Joe Jr., an attack by a [[Glossary:Kree Kleaners|Kree Kleaner]] sent after Marie for her desertion forced her to reveal her true nature to her children.{{r|Life of Captain Marvel Vol 2 3}} Marie managed to fend off her assailant and buy enough time to tell Carol and Joe her story.{{r|Life of Captain Marvel Vol 2 4}} However, when the Kleaner resurfaced shortly afterwards and Carol joined forces with her mother to fight it, Marie was fatally injured and died moments later in Carol's arms.{{r|Life of Captain Marvel Vol 2 5}}

===Re-Entry===
As Carol tried to reconnect with the public following her absence she was kidnapped by [[Mahkizmo (Earth-74101)|Nuclear Man]] and taken to [[Roosevelt Island]] which was under his total control.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 1}} There she joined the rebellion made with fellow captured women and led by [[Som (Earth-74101)|Som]]. However, she became suspicious of Som who following an attack by the "Metal-Men" admitted that he was Nuclear Man's son, but he genuinely wanted to help them. Despite this, Carol remained cautious of him. When the rebellion unearthed a tunnel into the [[Nuclear Man's Citadel|citadel]], Captain Marvel investigated it with Som and Spider-Woman. They found a laboratory where Nuclear Man was producing new manned "Metal-Men." Som also admitted that it was due to him that his father had lured Captain Marvel into the island, so he could produce powerful children with her. After an alarm went off, Captain Marvel stayed behind to cover Som and Spider-Woman's escape.{{r|{{cl|Captain Marvel Vol 10 2}}-[[Captain Marvel Vol 10 3|3]]}} She was then forced to fight Rogue to prove which of them would be worthy to become his bride. While the rebellion was launching the final attack on the citadel, Carol allowed Rogue to absorb her powers and her mind, and was now able to overpower Nuclear Man.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 4}} After returning to her body, both she and Rogue joined the attack on Nuclear Man; however, he used Som's powers to turn his son into a bomb. Luckily, Rogue was able to prevent that. When Carol and her friends cornered Nuclear Man he later teleported himself along with his son away. Afterwards, she and all of the female prisoners returned to their lives.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 5}}

===Wastrel===
When some mysterious men were stealing Kree technology from [[Damage Control (Earth-616)|Damage Control]]'s warehouses, Captain Marvel, alongside [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]], began investigating the thefts. After Carol convinced Kamala's parents to lift her grounding, the duo tracked down the culprits, who were revealed to be the original Walter Lawson, now going by the alias of Wastrel, commanding some Kree robots.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 4 4}} He explained to them his reason for stealing the technology, because he wanted to take revenge on the Kree, since he thought that they tried to deliberately kill him and purposely stole his life. After Kamala revealed Carol's Kree heritage to Wastrel, he used his [[Uni-Band]] to escape. Carol then dropped off Kamala at her house, since she was irritated at Kamala for revealing her heritage to Wastrel and trying to discuss her complicated relationship with the Kree. After three days, she brought Kamala back in the pursuit of Wastrel, where they found him at the Great Smoky Mountains, inside the rebuilt <i>[[Helion]]</i>. 

He told them that he had sent a distress call to the Kree who sent the [[Starforce (Earth-616)|Starforce]] division team [[Starforce Blue (Earth-616)|Starforce Blue]].{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 4 5}} Upon the arrival of the Kree, Wastrel admitted to them that he stole their technology and attacked them. Most of the Starforce Blue tried to get to Wastrel, while the superheroines fended them off. During the fight, Wastrel revealed that he had rebuilt the Psyche-Magnitron, but instead of giving powers just like it did with Carol, it would take them away. As Wastrel prepared to use the Psyche-Magnitron, Carol tried to reason with Wastrel, giving enough time for the Kree to cloak Kamala allowing her to destroy the machine. The superheroine duo parted ways following Walter's incarceration by the Kree.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 4 6}}

===Falling Star===
During a fight against three [[Krakens (Kree)|"Krakens"]], Carol began feeling weak as her powers were being drained. Suddenly a new superhero going by the name of [[Ripley Ryan (Earth-616)|Star]] helped Carol defeat one of the Krakens. However, when Carol checked the creature she found an unconscious Kree in the pilot seat, and being a hero with moral tried to help him. This however, made the public suspect of her relation to the Kree which eventually proved to be true when the true nature of her mother was revealed. People began accusing Captain Marvel as an evil alien and a traitor to humanity. This caused her to become demoralized which prompted her friends to try cheer her up with a quick party. After that, Carol was approached by Doctor Minerva who asked her for help in saving the Kree race from extinction, to which Carol agreed.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 8}} She and Rhodey went to Minerva's secret lab, since Carol didn't really trust her still, and found out that the Krakens were send by her. After Tony Stark analyzed her he found out that a mysterious device was formed within Carol's chest, which was responsible for draining her powers. Demanding answers, Carol went to Minerva's current location only to find a badly damaged Minerva with the words "You're not as smart as you think you are." written in Minerva's own blood on the wall.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 9}} 

After having Tony give medical treatment to Minerva, the latter revealed her plans for destroying Carol's reputation in order to join her in helping the Kree. She also revealed that Star was responsible for draining Carol's powers and turned on her when she found out her actual plans. This prompted Carol to confront Star in [[Times Square]] and tried to defeat her by removing the device in her chest, severing Star from her own powers, but Star revealed that all the people exposed to the Krakens' attacks had the device and began draining their energies instead.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 10}} Putting her device back to her chest, in order to prevent Star from killing the innocent people, Carol was then joined by [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat]] during the fight against Star, but eventually she was forced to rip Star's own device to finally stop her. Afterwards she had Star send to the Raft, and the people trusted in Carol again.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 11}}

As Kree refugee camps began overcrowding due to no other planet willing to host them following the destruction of Hala, this problem began to press on Carol who went drifting through space to think. She was captured by [[Vox Supreme (Earth-616)|Vox Supreme]], who bonded her to a suit. He ordered Carol to bring to him every member of the Avengers, threatening to detonate explosives within all of the Kree refugees' camps. Wanting to find a way to avoid either result, Carol went to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Project Gemini (Earth-616)|Project Gemini]] and made dead clones of the Avengers in order to trick Vox.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 13}} She then attacked Thor, but was outmatched by the God of Thunder. With help from [[Singularity (Multiverse)|Singularity]], who took Mjolnir away from Thor, Carol was able to knock out Thor and leave him inside of Singularity, bringing the head of Thor's newest clone to Vox.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 12}} Next she attacked Iron Man, bringing him to space and smashing his armor. After she brought Tony inside Singularity, she explained to him and Thor the whole situation.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 13}} After bringing Tony's clone to Vox, she went after the rest of the Avengers, but was attacked by Black Panther.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 14}}

She was able to knock out Black Panther, but was then attacked again by She-Hulk. During the fight Carol revealed herself to She-Hulk, confusing her which allowed Carol to defeat her. After leaving them within Singularity, and bringing the their clones to Vox, he suddenly attacked her, using the suit to knock Carol unconscious.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 15}} He revealed to her that he wanted to harvest the DNA of the Avengers, including her's, but Carol used a device made by Tony to destroy the suit and stagger Vox. She attacked him; however, Vox used his powers to throw Carol at the tube filled with Avengers' DNA. This caused Carol to be infused with their powers and she again attacked Vox, successfully trapping him within a box meant to cage superhumans. Meanwhile, the Avengers were able to dispose of the bombs from the Kree camps, avoiding further casualties. After Carol purged her friends' DNA from her body, she sent the imprisoned Vox to the Raft.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 16}}

===[[Empyre]]===
When Carol received a distress signal from the Blue Area of the Moon, she, alongside the Avengers, went there and was greeted by [[Swordsman (Cotati) (Earth-616)|Swordsman]] and [[Sequoia (Earth-616)|Quoi]], who told them about the threat that the [[Kree/Skrull Alliance (Earth-616)|Kree/Skrull Alliance]] posed to the [[Cotati]] and Earth.{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 0}} The Avengers agreed to help the Cotati against the Alliance and launched an attack on the armadas. However, after Iron Man disabled the Alliance's computer system, the Cotati revealed their true intention: to conquer the entire universe and eradicate the flesh-based population.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 1}} Captain Marvel tried to save the Kree and Skrulls who were being killed by the Cotati infection, but after seeing that [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]]'s [[Excelsior (Star-Sword)|Star Sword]] was able to kill the infection, the two combined their powers to disintegrate the entire infection. This proved to be lethal to Carol as she would have died if it wasn't for Reed Richards using [[R'Klll (Earth-616)|Tanalth]] Universal Weapon to restart her heart. Tanalth then gave the weapon to Carol making her an Accuser.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 2}}

[[File:Captain Marvel Vol 10 18 Textless.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]
After saving some of the Alliance's soldiers from some Cotati, she was tasked by the emperor to go after a soldier who had destroyed the sanctuary city of [[K'in-Al]]. After confronting the soldier, [[Lauri-Ell (Earth-616)|Lauri-Ell]], she found out that she was her half-sister. She then decided to ignore her orders and help her sister. After leaving her sister at her house, she returned to the destroyed city after being forgiven by the emperor. She tried to find the real culprit behind the destruction of K'in-Al, but was forced to go back to Earth when some Cotati began attacking. After she, Chewie and her sister were able to defeat the Cotati and save the people, Carol had [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] create three replica-like projections of her weapon and gave them to each of her most trusted allies and friends, War Machine, Spider-Woman, and Hazmat, in order to help her solve the mystery behind K'in-Al's destruction.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 18|19}} They eventually found out that Wastrel was indeed the one behind the city's destruction and, after destroying his Kree robots, apprehended him. When Lauri-Ell tried to save Kit from the Cotati, Carol and her allies joined her. During the fight Lauri-Ell got hold of Carol's Weapon and called back the pieces, becoming an Accuser and defeating the Cotati. Despite being fit for the role, Lauri-Ell returned the weapon to Carol, since Carol was officially an Accuser.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 20|21}}

After R'Klll, Hulkling's grandmother, imprisoned her grandson, she took his form and had the [[Pyre (Item)|Pyre]] deployed under his guise. She ordered [[Mur-G'nn (Earth-616)|Mur-G'nn]] to teleport Carol and Human Torch away from the ship. Unbeknownst to her, Carol and Johnny ended up at [[Wiccan and Hulkling's Apartment]], where they met Wiccan. The three then freed Teddy and battled R'Klll and the other members of the Alliance, until the [[Dark Harvest (Earth-616)|Dark Harvest]] began using the [[Omni-Wave Projector]] to create discord among the Alliance. After the [[New Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|New Fantastic Four]] stopped the threat of the projector by showing the Alliance the great power they can bring by working together, R'Klll's allies turned on her and she was defeated. Carol, Johnny and Billy then went to the [[Sun (Star)|Sun]] and, with their combined effort along with Tony's help, they were able to disable the Pyre after also being joined by Mur-G'nn, the Super-Skrull and [[Glah-Ree (Earth-616)|Captain Glory]].{{r|Empyre Vol 1 4|6}} Following the defeat of the Empyre, Carol gave the mantle of Accuser to her sister, and participated in the wedding of Teddy and Billy. However, during the party, Abigail Brand lashed out at Carol for not calling Alpha Flight, telling everyone that she would be leaving the organization, since it wasn't important anymore in her opinion.{{r|Empyre: Aftermath Avengers Vol 1 1}} 

After this, Carol was transported to a future in which [[Ove (Earth-20368)|Ove]], the son of the [[Amora (Earth-20368)|Enchantress]] and [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-20368)|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], essentially ruled the world after the apocalypse. Her, as well as [[Emma Frost (Earth-20368)|Emma Frost]] and several children of notable superheroes defeated Ove at that particular time. despite this, Ove escaped and travelled to the present day and Carol came back as as well.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 22|26}} Because she didn't feel it was right to continue dating Rhodey, who's [[Carol Rhodes (Earth-20368)|daughter]] she had met in the future with a different mother, she broke up with him. She felt depressed for about a week, until Jessica Jones and several other of her friends made her go out with them, in order to have some fun and forget about Rhodey. After going on several unsuccessful dates with various guys, she spent the night with Stephen Strange, which she immediately regretted after. Becoming fearful of Ove taking over the world in the present day, Carol began looking for a way to become skilled at magic in order to defeat him. After going to several magicians, including Stephen Strange and Nico Minoru, and being rejected by all of them, she went to the Enchantress. The Enchantress had her get a magical object, the [[Heart of the Serpent]], which had the power to take away someone's magic.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 28}} Carol began to fight Ove and in the process, Enchantress discovered that he was her future son. Carol tricked him into drinking the potion, stripping him of his magical abilities, and rendering him basically useless in a fight with her. Stephen Strange disapproved, saying that it was completely unethical, and that she would likely regret it.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 22|29}}

| Powers                  = [[File:Avengers Vol 5 19 Textless.jpg|Captain Marvel regaining her Binary powers|thumb|200px|right]] [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]'s intel classified Captain Marvel as Power Level 8.{{r|Secret War: From the Files of Nick Fury Vol 1 1}}

'''Enhanced Physical Abilities'''
*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Carol is superhumanly strong, though her specific level of strength has varied over the years. She was previously listed at a level of roughly Class 50, half her original strength as Binary.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 4}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 2}} However, since she is able to absorb and manipulate various types of energy, she can use this redirected energy to temporarily increase her physical strength to near-Binary levels, or Class 100+.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 24}} Currently, her strength level at its resting rate allows her to support well over 100 tons, as she was able to support the weight of dead Celestial as one fell to Earth.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 2}}
*'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Carol's musculature produces considerably fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. As Binary, she could physically exert herself at peak capacity for about 24 hours before fatigue began to impair her.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 36}} She was reduced to roughly half this capacity after losing her Binary powers. However, she is capable of channeling absorbed energy to further increase her stamina to higher levels.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 47}}
*'''Superhuman Durability:''' The tissues of her body are considerably harder and more resistant to physical injury than those of an ordinary human. She is capable of withstanding high caliber bullets, great impact forces, falls from great heights, exposure to temperature and pressure extremes, and powerful energy blasts without sustaining any injury. While channeling the energy she has absorbed, her body's resilience is extended to an even greater degree.{{citation}} As Binary, Carol managed to survive the explosion that destroyed the entire planet Brood Outpost.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 23}}
*'''Superhuman Agility:''' As Binary, Carol's agility, balance, and bodily coordination were enhanced to levels significantly beyond the natural limits of the human body.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 36}}
*'''Superhuman Reflexes:''' As Binary, Carol's reflexes were heightened to the point of being virtually instantaneous.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition Vol 1 36}}

'''Flight:''' Carol is capable of propelling herself through the air and the vacuum of space at tremendous speeds. Although her top speed is unknown, she flew at three times the speed of sound for several hours, so it is likely she can go much faster.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 8}}
*'''Space Flight:''' As Binary, Carol was capable of surviving unaided in the vacuum of space for indefinite periods of time.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 163}} After first losing her Binary powers, Carol proved incapable of achieving orbit or surviving unaided in space. However, she was highly intoxicated when she attempted to do so, which may have hampered her progress.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 7}} She has since proved capable of surviving and fighting in the vacuum of space, only requiring an air supply to do so.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 1}}

'''Flash Precognition (a.k.a. Cosmic Awareness/Hyper-Cosmic Awareness'''): As Ms. Marvel, Carol was subconsciously able to anticipate the moves of her opponents, though this power activated randomly, making it unreliable. After Rogue robbed her of her powers, she was subsequently transformed into Binary. After her Binary powers faded, it seems that Carol's Seventh Sense returned. T'challa theorized that when the Kree Psyche-Magnitron gave Carol her powers, she inherited some of Captain Mar-Vell's abilities during exposure to it. In that sense her travels across Exospace and the like bolstered this aspect of her powers to see the cage outside of reality that's binding [[Eternity (Earth-616)|the Marvel Universe]].{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 1}}

'''Regenerative Manipulation:''' Captain Marvel boasts a healing ability which she can consciously push to an extant, boasting a healing factor supplemented by absorbing energy.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 #10}} A facet of which was gifted unto her when part of the central nucleus of a techno-organic alien named [[Cru (Earth-616)|Cru]] had physically merged with her.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 #20}} This facility also bolsters the potency of her metabolism, allowing her to quickly regenerate from catastrophic wounds such as nuclear detonation, genetic disruption even brood infection. Her newfound recovery abilities had the added bonus of restoring lost biophysical facilities; like her ability to shift between Binary and Carol at will.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 #24}}
* '''Contaminant Immunity:''' Carol's regenerative powers coupled with her human/alien Kree physiology are so potent that she has a greater degree of immunity to toxins, diseases and/or poisons.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #7}}{{r|Quicksilver #10}}{{Verify source}} Even being able to resist embryonic infection by the brood after a second attempt by one of their queens.{{r|{{cl|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 23}}-[[Ms. Marvel Vol 2 24|24]]}}
* '''Decelerated Aging/Conventional Immortality:''' Dr. McCoy brought up how these new healing abilities put those of Wolverine to shame. Stating that her regenerative powers would keep Ms. Danvers in her prime forever.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 #21}}
*'''Healing:''' Like her accelerated healing factor, Carol is able to rapidly heal others by focusing different forms of energy into their body, thereby greatly boosting their healing processes.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #7}}{{r|Quicksilver #10}}{{Verify source}}

'''Energy Manipulation:''' Much like her namesake predecessor, Captain Marvel can control, absorb, and manipulate various types of energy to be discharged however she sees fit.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 4}} Over the years, Carol has become an expert at modulating the various aspects of repurposed energy at her disposal, even learning some new tricks from her alt. counterparts during her life as a superheroine.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 10}}
*'''Energy Absorption:''' Her body is capable of absorbing various types of energy for the purpose of temporarily enhancing her own physical attributes. She can augment her strength and energy projection up to the force of an exploding nuclear weapon.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 6}} If empowered by enough energy, she can assume her Binary form again temporarily.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 28}}
*'''Photonic Blasts:''' Carol can fire powerful concussion blasts of photon and stellar light energy from her hands and fingertips.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 5}} As with a doppelganger of hers, Ms. Marvel can potentially discharge her energy from the eyes as well.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 10}} Something which she has done, but has little control over it and cannot see out through her optics when doing so.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 9 32}}
*'''Molecular Manipulation:''' By channeling the absorbed energy, Carol is able to manipulate and alter matter and energy on a molecular level.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #7}}{{r|Quicksilver #10}}{{Verify source}} She can use absorbed energy to transform her regular clothing into her costume and vice-versa. (This is an ability she once possessed as Ms. Marvel. Carol did not demonstrate the ability as Binary, it only resurfaced after her powers were reduced and she began going by Warbird.){{r|Quicksilver #10}}
**'''Matter Transmutation:''' By using her molecular manipulation, She is able to alter and reform matter and energy around her.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #7}}{{r|Quicksilver #10}}{{Verify source}} This allows her to create and absorb matter and energy, shape, and rebuild it into anything of her choosing.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #7}}{{r|Quicksilver #10}}{{Verify source}}
*'''Energy-Construct Creation:''' As Captain Marvel, Carol has used her energy powers in more creative ways: She was able to create an energy barrier around a blast cannon which choked up the works until its internal structure violently ruptured from the inside out.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 4}} She can even shape her stored energy into more practical shapes, like razor blades of pure energy to slice and sear with.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 10}}
*'''Self Sustenance:''' Captain Marvel proved time and again she can survive without need for eat, sleep, breath or rest by thriving the ambient energies within her surroundings.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 28}} Capable of thriving perfectly within the cold recesses of deep space with little to no discomfort at all.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 8 6}}

| title = Binary Powers

| body = As Binary, Carol was once linked to the power of a [[Wikipedia:White hole|white hole]] and was able to generate heat, light, radiation and access all other forms of energy along the electromagnetic spectrum on an almost solar scale. She also had minor control over gravity. She could breathe in space and travel at the speed of light. And was able to go toe-to-toe against [[Pyreus Kril (Earth-616)|Firelord]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 30}} The link was believed to be severed, therefore she could no longer do so on the level she once had. However, Carol proved she still retained the capacity for this power, as she still remains the ability to connect with white holes at will within her.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 28}}

| body = '''Metamorphosis:''' (''Formerly'') An added benefit due to her symbiosis with the alien, Carol/Cru had the extra ability to alternate and optimize biological matter comprising of muscular, dermal and skeletal tissues. This would often cause her to shift between her normal Caucasian skin tone and the blue hue of her extraterrestrial partner.{{r|{{cl|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 15}}-[[Ms. Marvel Vol 2 17|17]]}}
*'''Biomass Alteration:''' (''Formerly'') Instead of typical outer form alteration, Ms. Marvel had the ability to change her physiological structure around at will. Able to increase her size, mass and density around when she was exposed to an A.I.M. genetic scrambler.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 #15}} Gaining additional strength and resilience towards physical injury than she normally showcases at regular physical levels.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 #16}} Even while her original abilities were disabled Cru while hosting within Carol had the ability to increase the latter's physical prowess enough to dismember Brood warriors barehanded.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 #23}}

'''Talented Journalist:''' Carol is a talented journalist excelling as a freelance writer and magazine editor owing to her time as an intelligence agent.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol 1 7}}

'''Scientific Knowledge:''' Having been given memories equivalent to a Kree Captain by the Psyche-Magnitron, Carol has extensive knowledge of the technologically-advanced vehicles and devices of the Kree Empire similar to Mar-Bell. This allowed her to do things like invent a serum that transformed her into a water breather to pursue Tiger Shark.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 16}} She also has an understanding of aerodynamics from her pilot training and education and was able to strategize downing Robyn Hood using the square-cube law.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man Vol 1 10}}

| Equipment               = '''[[Captain Marvel's Suit]]:''' Around the same time Carol Danvers decided to take over Mar-Vell's codename, she was wearing a full-bodied suit, a variant of Mar-Vell's specialized [[Kree Militia Uniforms|Kree Suit]], while retaining the sash which she wore as Ms. Marvel, which was made out of Stark-designed impermeable fabric. The costume also had a collapsible helmet that, when used, had Carol's hair coming out as a mohawk.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 1}}
