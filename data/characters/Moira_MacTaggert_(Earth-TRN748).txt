===Moira's First to Third Lives===
Moira Kinross was born to powerful Scots nobleman [[Lord Kinross (Earth-TRN748)|Lord Kinross]]. When she was thirteen years old, Moira's [[Homo superior|mutant]] powers activated, but they didn't manifest, since her gift was that of reincarnation. She led a simple life, marrying a man named [[Kenneth Cowan (Earth-TRN748)|Kenneth Cowan]] and having three children: twin boys, [[Callum Cowan (Earth-TRN748)|Callum]] and [[Dean Cowan (Earth-TRN748)|Dean]], and a girl named [[Abigail Cowan (Earth-TRN748)|Abigail]]. Kenneth died when Moira was sixty-eight years old, and she passed away from congestive heart failure at age seventy-four, ending [[Earth-TRN748|her first life]].<!-- {{r|House of X Vol 1 2}} -->

[[File:Earth-TRN749 from House of X Vol 1 2.jpg|thumb|left]]
[[Earth-TRN749|Moira's second life]] began in utero, having already become fully sentient and possessing a perfect recollection of her prior life. This allowed Moira to appear intellectually gifted, and she was pushed in the direction of academia. She didn't fight her parents' wishes, since she intended to understand her true nature. When she was forty-four years old, Moira learned of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-TRN749)|Charles Xavier]] and deduced that she was a mutant; however, she died in a plane crash when she tried to fly to the [[United States of America]] to meet him.<!-- {{r|House of X Vol 1 2}} -->

[[File:Irene Adler (Earth-TRN750) and Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748) from Inferno Vol 2 1.jpg|thumb|right]]
In [[Earth-TRN750|her third life]], Moira dove into anthropology and genetics. She actively sought out [[Charles Xavier (Earth-TRN750)|Charles Xavier]] when they both attended [[Oxford University]], but she became reluctant to approach him because she found him arrogant and selfish. Due to her distaste for her powers, Moira devoted her life to developing a mutant cure. She succeeded, but caught the attention of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-TRN750)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], who attacked her laboratory. The precognitive mutant [[Irene Adler (Earth-TRN750)|Destiny]] warned Moira against following the same path in her next lives, since she would be able to stop her again. She additionally revealed to Moira that she would only live a total of ten lives; eleven at the most. Afterwards, Destiny had [[St. John Allerdyce (Earth-TRN750)|Pyro]] burn Moira to death.{{r|House of X Vol 1 2}}

===Moira's Fourth to Eighth Lives===
After being reborn to [[Earth-TRN751|her fourth life]], Moira threw herself into fully understanding the human-mutant dilemma. Becoming open to the potential benefits of mutants, she gave [[Charles Xavier (Earth-TRN751)|Charles Xavier]] a second look and they fell in love. They married and established [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]]. She stood by Xavier's side for years until they both died at the hands of the mutant-hunting [[Sentinels]].<!-- {{r|House of X Vol 1 2}} -->

[[File:Earth-TRN752 from House of X Vol 1 2.jpg|thumb|left]]
In [[Earth-TRN752|her fifth life]], Moira decided aggression was the only acceptable response to the violent tendencies of humankind. She ran away from home at a young age and sought Xavier a decade before they were supposed to meet. Moira shared the knowledge of her past lives and it radicalized him. Instead of a school for mutants, Charles created an army and isolated it from the rest of the world in a nation called [[Faraway]]. It was eventually targeted by Sentinels and Moira fell into a coma due to injury. She died a year later when Faraway fell to genocide.{{r|House of X Vol 1 2}}

[[File:Earth-TRN754 from House of X Vol 1 2.jpg|thumb|right]]
Her sixth life continued [[Earth-TRN753|one thousand years in the future]], where mutants had lost the [[Human-Machine-Mutant War|war against technology]] and were nearly extinct, except for Moira, [[James Howlett (Earth-TRN753)|Wolverine]] and a few others, who were preserved in the [[Preserve|personal zoo]] of the [[Librarian (Earth-TRN753)|Librarian]]. The Librarian visited the preserve, revealing to Moira and Wolverine that while mutants had believed the [[Sentinels]] to be their greatest threat, their purpose was merely to buy humanity time to bring about the birth of a new species: the so-called ''[[Homo novissima]]'', representing humanity's absolute control of both biology and technology. Now these homo novissima were preparing to transfer their consciousnesses to machines in order to be absorbed by the [[Phalanx (Race)|Phalanx]] on the day of the "Ascension" the following day. Moira realised that neither man nor machines were the enemy, but man’s ability to control his own evolution and the surrounding environment. After Wolverine surprised and killed the Librarian, she let him kill her in order to reincarnate and use this knowledge in her next life.{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 6}}

Because of the events of her previous lives, Moira spent [[Earth-TRN754|her seventh life]] eradicating the bloodline of the Sentinels' creator, [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-TRN754)|Bolivar Trask]], hoping that preventing the creation of Sentinels would allow mutantkind to become the dominant species before humanity could unlock the secrets that would turn them into the Homo novissima. However, Sentinels were still invented in this world, and Moira was killed after discovering a [[Master Mold (Earth-TRN754)|Master Mold]] [[Sentinel Headquarters|Sentinel factory]]. This experience radicalized her.<!-- {{r|House of X Vol 1 2}} -->

In [[Earth-TRN755|her eighth life]], Moira embraced the philosophy of mutant terrorist [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-TRN755)|Magneto]] and helped him conquer America and establish the House of M. But during the [[War of M]], Magneto was defeated and killed by the combined might of Earth's human and mutant heroes while Moira was imprisoned. She was later killed during a failed prison escape.{{r|House of X Vol 1 2}}

===Moira's Ninth Life===
[[File:Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748) and En Sabah Nur (Earth-TRN756) from House of X Vol 1 2.jpg|thumb|left]]
In [[Earth-TRN756|her ninth life]], Moira abandoned the hope that her previous endeavors could save mutantkind. With few lives left, Moira awakened [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-TRN756)|Apocalypse]] who killed both [[Charles Xavier (Earth-TRN756)|Xavier]] and [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-TRN756)|Magneto]]. Apocalypse and Moira later formed the [[X-Men (Earth-TRN756)|X-Men]], and waged an endless war against humankind and their machine allies that came to be dubbed the "Apocalypse War," which eventually led to the rise of the [[Man-Machine Supremacy (Earth-TRN756)|Man-Machine Supremacy]] and the birth of [[Nimrod (Earth-TRN756)|Nimrod]]; an intelligent and adaptable Sentinel that was virtually indestructible. Moira and Apocalypse formulated a plan to eliminate Nimrod, but during an assassination attempt on Apocalypse, Moira was grievously injured before she and Apocalypse could destroy Nimrod, and placed into stasis.<!-- {{r|Powers of X Vol 1 3}} -->

Moira remained in suspended animation for sixteen years, until the X-Men -- now consisting of Apocalypse, [[James Howlett (Earth-TRN756)|War]], [[Rasputin IV (Earth-TRN756)|Rasputin IV]], an unnamed [[Cardinal (X-Men) (Earth-TRN756)|Cardinal]], [[North (Earth-TRN756)|North]], [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-TRN756)|Cypher]] possessed by [[Krakoa (Earth-TRN756)|Krakoa]], and [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-TRN756)|Xorn]] -- attempted to acquire the exact date and circumstances of Nimrod's creation. With the rest of the team dead, War delivered all the information Moira needed to reset the timeline, this time with the exact knowledge of where and when to intervene in order to stop Nimrod from ever being created. Moira was then killed by War himself, allowing Moira to reincarnate.{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 3}} After all the lives lived and lost, Moira decided to approach her tenth life differently.{{r|House of X Vol 1 2}}

===Moira's Tenth Life===
[[File:Charles Xavier (Earth-616) and Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748) from Power of X Vol 1 1 0001.png|thumb|right|Moira opening her mind to Charles Xavier in her Tenth Life|250px]]
In [[Earth-616|her tenth and potentially last life]], Moira decided to return to [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]], met him again at Oxford, and allowed him to read her mind to learn everything that had happened to her in her previous lives. In this new life, Moira wished to unite all of mutantkind, including the three great mutant leaders she had cast her lot in during previous lives; Xavier, Magneto and Apocalypse. To this end, Moira would manipulate all of them, in the  hopes of shaping them into the people she needed them to become.{{r|House of X Vol 1 2}}

Moira was dating [[Joseph MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Joseph MacTaggert]] at the time, but soon separated from him to see Charles exclusively, and their romance lasted for years. Eventually they became engaged, but Joseph got into Charles' head and convinced him that he needed to serve in the armed forces before being a man worthy of Moira. She promised to wait for Charles until he was released from military service, but Joe weaseled his way back into Moira's heart once Charles was absent. Xavier received a letter from Moira breaking off their engagement without explanation and stating that she was returning to [[Scotland]]. Moira and Joe were soon married.{{r|X-Men #127}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #389}}

Joseph MacTaggert proved to be a brutal husband. Moira eventually fled from him to [[New York City]], but Joe tracked her down, beat her and assaulted her sexually, causing her to be hospitalized for a week and leaving her pregnant. From then on, Moira lived apart from her husband, although he refused to grant her a divorce, and she kept the fact that he had a son secret from him for twenty years.{{r|X-Men #127}}

Moira's journals would later reveal that she had re-engaged Joseph romantically as part of a plan formulated by Xavier to create a mutant with the power to warp reality, that might one day be used in tandem with other [[Five (Earth-616)|mutants]] to overcome death itself. Moira identified potential matches for both herself and Charles that might produce such a mutant, which eventually resulted in the births of [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]] and [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]] respectively. She also ended her romantic relationship with Xavier due to fear that she was breaking him, rendering him useless for her future plans. {{r|Powers of X Vol 1 6}}

====Genetic Scientist====
[[File:Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Book of the Dead 2004 Vol 1 1 0001.png|thumb|left]]
Moira MacTaggert led a brilliant career as one of the world's leading geneticists, earning a Nobel Prize for her work.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #348}} She founded a [[Mutant Research Center]] on [[Muir Island]] off the coast of Scotland. She eventually renewed contact with Xavier during a period he spent in England working on a degree in psychiatry. Xavier and MacTaggert discussed the possibility of establishing a school for training superhuman mutants in the use of their powers. Eventually, MacTaggert became Xavier's "silent partner" in founding this school, which trained the team of mutant adventurers known as the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #300}}

When Moira's son began to manifest destructive mutant powers, she attempted to cure him, but her efforts were in vain, and she was forced to keep him imprisoned at her Mutant Research Center. Moira took as her ward the orphaned Scottish girl [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Rahne Sinclair]], who would herself demonstrate mutant powers in years to come.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #4}} Moira considered Rahne to be her own daughter, as much as if she was biologically so.{{r|New Mutants #26}}

====Deadly Genesis====
During the early years of Xavier's Academy, Moira founded and ran a secondary facility not far from the Xavier School, in which she had her own students - gathered together youths who she took out of bad situations and adopted as her wards, training them in their abilities without the highly militant regimen of Charles' X-Men.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 4}}-[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 6|6]]}}

When [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] captured the original X-Men,{{r|Giant-Size X-Men #1}} it was Moira's children whom Charles went to first - not the second team of X-Men, as it was originally believed - putting them through the psionic equivalent of boot camp and allowing them to believe they were being trained over months as X-Men. Charles took them from Moira's care immediately. Moira's children were apparently all killed, and Xavier suppressed even the memory of them from his own students, to keep them from going back to save them. Significant portions of Moira's history were apparently blocked from her memory by Charles Xavier. Only Moira's project tapes, one made directly after the event, before Xavier could suppress the memories, and an abandoned research center remained as clues.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis Vol 1 6|6]]}}

[[File:Sean Cassidy (Earth-616) and Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748) from X-Men Vol 1 129 001.jpg|thumb]]
Moira MacTaggert finally made her presence known to the X-Men when she arrived at their doorstep claiming to be their new housekeeper.{{r|X-Men #96}} The X-Men soon learned her true profession and visited her Muir Isle research center. Moira fell in love with [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Sean Cassidy]], the X-Man known as the Banshee, and their relationship persisted.{{r|X-Men #104}}

====Proteus====
[[File:Classic X-Men Vol 1 36 Back.jpg|thumb|left]]
Moira's son, [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Kevin]], who was code-named "Mutant X" but called himself Proteus, escaped from confinement at Muir Isle and began using his powers to possess the bodies of others and drain their life energies and to warp people's perceptions of reality to terrorize the Scottish countryside. The X-Men attempted to stop Proteus, and Moira warned Joseph MacTaggert about him. (At this point it had been twenty years since she had left him.) Proteus took possession of his father's body, ravaging it, and attempted to kill his mother. Instead, however, Proteus was himself apparently destroyed by the X-Man [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]]. Joseph MacTaggert died as a result of being possessed by Proteus.{{r|X-Men #125|128}}

====New Mutants====
Sometime afterward, Moira discovered that Rahne Sinclair had the mutant ability to transform herself into a wolf-like form. Dr. MacTaggert brought Sinclair to Xavier and persuaded him to establish a new team of superhuman mutant trainees who became known as the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]].{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #4}} 

[[File:Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748) and Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616) from New Mutants Vol 2 11 001.jpg|thumb]]
In her laboratory on Muir Island, Moira was assisted by [[Jamie Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]]. She took in [[Thomas Corsi (Earth-616)|Tom Corsi]] and [[Sharon Friedlander (Earth-616)|Sharon Friedlander]], following their transformational encounter with the Demon Bear.{{r|New Mutants #26}}

Moira also became acquainted with another of Xavier's former lovers, [[Gabrielle Haller (Earth-616)|Gabrielle Haller]], and learned that Charles had an unstable mutant son of his own, [[David Haller (Earth-616)|David]].{{r|New Mutants #1}} Moira treated the powerful but seemingly autistic David Haller for months before finally convincing Gabby to let Xavier see his son and help with the case. After Xavier arrived, though, David attacked Moira and Rahne, catapulting them into his warring mindscape, and rendering their bodies comatose. After they were rescued by Xavier and the New Mutants, Moira resumed her work to help David.{{r|New Mutants #26|28}}

When David's [[Jack Wayne (Legion Personality) (Earth-616)|Jack Wayne]] personality resurfaced, Moira and Rahne were again put at risk, but the New Mutants arrived and contained the threat, placing David back into Moira's care once more. Moira hoped that as David aged, he would be able to reintegrate his different personalities into a whole.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 44}}

====Muir Island X-Men====
Following the [[Mutant Massacre]], several Morlocks came to Muir Isle to recuperate - including [[Callisto (Earth-616)|Callisto]], who became Moira's bodyguard. It also became home to many of the children known as [[Warpies (Earth-616)|warpies]].

[[File:Muir Island X-Men (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 254 cover.jpg|thumb|left]]
Moira and Sean also rescued [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], whose powers were in flux and granting her increased size and invulnerability. Moira began testing Lorna to uncover why her powers were acting this way, but she remained unaware that another side-effect of these powers was to amplify negative emotions such as anger and hatred in those around Lorna.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 253}}

When Muir Island came under attack from the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]] and Banshee was shot, Moira organised a [[Muir Island X-Men (Earth-616)|team]] to defend the island, including Polaris, Tom Corsi, Sharon Friedlander, [[Jimaine Szardos (Earth-616)|Amanda Sefton]], and [[Alysande Stuart (Earth-616)|Alysande Stuart]]. She had [[Healer (Morlock) (Earth-616)|Healer]] bring back Banshee and immediately asked for him to rejoin the battle.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 253|254}}

She later had Legion use Cerebro to try and locate the X-Men, but this allowed the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] to possess him. By possessing Legion, whose [[Jack Wayne (Legion Personality) (Earth-616)|Jack Wayne]] personality was already using Polaris' powers to corrupt everyone on Muir Island, the Shadow King was able to take control of even more people.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 257|259}} 

With all of Muir Island possessed by the Shadow King, Moira was the leader, presiding over gladiatorial matches in an area called the Arena.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 278}} When Banshee returned with Xavier and the X-Men, the Shadow King made Moira shoot him. She was finally freed from the Shadow King's control by [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 280}}

====Legacy Virus and the Fake Death====
As the first human to contract the [[Legacy Virus]], Moira was one of many frantically working on a cure, even to the point of self-quarantining herself at one stage.{{r|Excalibur #80}} When the Muir Island facility was destroyed by [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]] and her [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Mutants]], Moira had discovered the cure to the new strain of the Legacy Virus that Mystique had created; one that only infected humans. Moira was heavily injured in the attack,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 108}} and used a [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]] golem to fake her death,{{r|Powers of X #6}} having it appear to cling on to life long enough to survive a transatlantic flight to transfer that information to Charles, then die in his arms.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 108}}

====Krakoa====
[[File:Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748) from Inferno Vol 2 1 001.jpg|thumb]]
Faking her death allowed Moira and Xavier to run some preliminary testing with resurrection protocols, later perfected by the birth of Proteus and the creation of the [[Five (Earth-616)|Five]]. Most mutants didn't know that Moira was still alive as she was hiding in a Krakoa blackout zone called [[Moira's No-Space]].{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 6}}

Moira and Charles Xavier also tasked several technopath mutants (such as [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]] and [[Sage (Earth-616)|Sage]]) with creating a system called "Sleeping Giant" to monitor for Nimrod technological thresholds being reached and/or the attempted creation of a "Mother Mold": a replicating, adaptive Sentinel factory that was self-aware and capable of creating Master Molds. Xavier and Magneto would eventually task the X-Men with destroying the [[Mother Mold (Earth-616)|Mother Mold]] and preventing the creation of Nimrod.{{r|House of X Vol 1 3}}

Prior to the first Krakoan [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council]] meeting, Professor X and Magneto revealed to Moira the council members. Moira was suspicious about [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] not having named her extra Council seat yet, while Mystique agreed to join the council on the condition that they bring Destiny back to life, but Moira was opposed to having precognitive mutants like Destiny on Krakoa, since they could end up revealing Moira's ultimate secret: that despite all her striving, over ten different lifetimes, mutants had always lost.{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 6}}

====Inferno====
While Xavier and Magneto increasingly began taking matters into their own hands, they were forced to return for Moira's advice after failing to prevent the birth of [[Nimrod (Earth-616)|Nimrod]], and subsequently failing to destroy it. They asked Moira if it was possible for mutantkind and the machines to reconcile and form an alliance. Moria dismissed the idea and instead urged them to focus on preventing the resurrection of Destiny once and for all, by removing Mystique from the Quiet Council and erasing Destiny's back-up and genetic material. {{r|Inferno Vol 2 1}}

While the pair agreed to do as Moira counselled, unbeknownst to them, Mystique had already outmaneuvered them and had resurrected Destiny behind their backs, even managing to win Destiny a seat on the Quiet Council. Xavier and Magneto reported back to a furious Moira. She first asked if Magneto could not simply kill her, but when he refused, the trio agreed to bring [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] into their cabal, in order to secure their grip on the Quiet Council. The three of them met with Emma, and Moira opened her mind to her, allowing Emma to learn the truth about their plans. In addition to this, she supported Xavier and Magneto's plans to fill the final vacant seat on the Quiet Council with someone they could trust; [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]]. {{r|Inferno Vol 2 2}}
