===Origin===
'''David Alleyne''' was raised by his [[Christopher Alleyne (Earth-616)|father]] and [[Dorothy Alleyne (Earth-616)|mother]] with his younger sister, [[Kim Alleyne (Earth-616)|Kim]], in their home in the [[Hyde Park (Illinois)|Hyde Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]], [[Illinois (State)|Illinois]]. Growing up, David was always bright and intelligent, but when his [[X-Gene|mutant powers]] activated, the answers just started coming to him. He quickly realized he was a [[Homo superior|mutant]] with the ability to telepathically absorb the knowledge and skills of anyone nearby. Concerned that this knowledge was not authentic, David kept his mutation a secret and began studying even harder. He began taking college-level courses while finishing high school and started working with [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]] at the university library until he was outed by the hate group [[Purity]]. After his cover was blown, [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Danielle Moonstar]] recruited him.{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 4}}

[[File:New Mutants Squad (Earth-616) and Joshua Guthrie (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 6 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Prodigy leading [[New Mutants Squad (Earth-616)|the New Mutants Training Squad]]]]

===[[New Mutants Squad (Earth-616)|New Mutants Training Squad]]===
David was enrolled in the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]], given the codename '''[[Prodigy]]''', and placed on Moonstar's [[New Mutants Squad (Earth-616)|New Mutants Training Squad]] along with [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]], [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]], [[Sofia Mantega (Earth-616)|Wind Dancer]], [[Laurie Collins (Earth-616)|Wallflower]], and [[Kevin Ford (Earth-616)|Wither]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 2}} Dani appointed Prodigy as team leader, but he declined and Wind Dancer took over. She turned out to have some limits, and in the end, Prodigy and Wind Dancer chose to become co-leaders.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 6}}

In an attempt to increase his usefulness, Prodigy asked [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] to remove the mental block despite Moonstar's apprehensions. Instead of removing the block, Emma and Dani secretly subjected David to a startling [[Earth-600123|vision of a possible future]] should David's powers enhance. Frightened by this grim vision, Prodigy opted not to have his powers enhanced,{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #10|11}} and began distancing himself from this friends especially Nori.{{r|{{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 12}}-[[New X-Men Vol 2 15|15]]}} The revelation that Josh was having a secret relationship with [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]] only deepened the rift.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 12}} In an attempt to mend bonds, Sofia (Wind Dancer) tricked everyone into a camp-out on the grounds of the Institute. While bickering and even fist fighting broke out, Sofia was able to eventually reconcile her teammates.{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}

[[File:David Alleyne (Earth-616) and Noriko Ashida (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 22 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Prodigy and [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]]]]
===[[Decimation]]===
In the wake of the [[Decimation|M-Day]], David lost his powers.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 20}} To transform the X-Mansion into a mutant sanctuary, all depowered students were asked to leave. Unfortunately, the bus was blown up by the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]], killing all aboard.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 23}} Luckily, David was not on the bus.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 24}} With the [[Danger Room]] inactive, Prodigy built the [[Danger Cave (Earth-616)|Danger Cave]] in the caverns below the school to allow his teammates to train after he left.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 21}} However, [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and the Alleynes decided that it would be safer for him to remain at the mansion since [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Rev. William Stryker]] was targeting depowered mutants.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 26}}

When Stryker attacked the mansion, Prodigy was wounded by one of the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] while protecting the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]]. Deciding to become more proactive in their battles, Prodigy joined the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]] and helped to lead the assault on [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] at [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]]'s [[Eagle Plaza|place]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas (State)|Texas]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #30|32}} He proved useful to the team, and with the defeat of Nimrod, Cyclops offered Prodigy a permanent place on the New X-Men and at the Xavier Institute. His actions consequently red-flagged him by the O*N*E along with the other New X-Men.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 33}}

===Quest For Magik===
Along with his class and teammates, Prodigy was pulled into [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]] by [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]] during his search for [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]]. He was interrogated by Belasco, and as he told him she was dead, Belasco tore out his heart in a rage.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 38}} Prodigy collapsed dead, but Elixir was able to act quickly and regrow his heart.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 39}} David then tended to the drained Elixir, freed the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] from Belasco's special telepathy proof helmets, and organized [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]] and [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]] in battling Belasco. Belasco was finally defeated by Magik, who sent all the students and X-Men back to the mansion.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 41}}

[[File:David Alleyne (Earth-616) and Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 42 0001.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] approaching Prodigy with an offer]]
The trip to Limbo deeply affected all the New X-Men. Fearing for David's life, Surge kissed Hellion in front of the other students in hopes of driving David away.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}} Prodigy decided to leave, but was confronted by the Stepford Cuckoos, who offered to restore all of the memories he had previously gained. Prodigy accepted the offer, and with his restored knowledge, he was made a junior teacher to the New X-Men, responsible for their training when the other X-Men were away.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 43}}

===World War Hulk===
When the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] attacked the school, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] ordered David to protect the other students, instead of taking part in the fight against the Hulk.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #1|2}}

===Messiah Complex===
When Surge decided to lead the New X-Men in an assault on the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Prodigy disagreed with the decision and opted to remain at the mansion with Elixir and [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 44}} He began repairing [[Cerebra]] despite [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]]'s insistence that it was "deep-fried."{{r|X-Men Vol 2 206}} Later, Prodigy aided Beast in providing medical aid to their wounded comrades in the infirmary.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 45}} He helped protect the wounded from the attacks of [[Predator X]], and was part of the group teleported by [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] to [[Muir Island]] for the climactic battle of the fate of [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Messiah baby]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 46}}

===[[San Francisco]] & [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]]===
Although no longer a mutant, Prodigy moved to [[San Francisco]] when invited by the X-Men to join them in their new mutant haven. He helped in battling the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]] force,{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men #1|4}} moving the X-Men to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]],{{r|X-Men: Legacy Annual #1}} constructing a clean water system for the island,{{r|Nation X #1}} and defending Utopia from the [[Evolutionaries]].{{r|X-Men Vol 3 13|15}}

===[[Second Coming]]===
When the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Mutant Messiah]] returned to the present, Prodigy aided [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Doctor Nemesis]] and the [[X-Club (Earth-616)|X-Club]] on Utopia.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 26}}

===Schism & Regenesis===
When Wolverine and Cyclops decided to [[Schism (Event)|part ways]], Prodigy was a vocal proponent for remaining on Utopia with Cyclops.{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 1}} He was later appointed leadership of the younger X-Men on [[Utopia]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 6}}

===[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]===
Prodigy was among the young X-Men detained in the [[Avengers Compound]] with the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]], during the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|war]] between the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|Avengers Academy #30|33}}

===Post-[[AvX]]===
[[File:David Alleyne (Earth-616) from Young Avengers Vol 2 6 003.jpg|thumb|left|Prodigy working as superhero support]]
David opted not to return to [[Westchester County|Westchester]] to attend [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]] with the other [[Xavier Institute student body|young mutants]] despite urging from [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Transonic]]. He refused X-teams affiliation, as he sensed that the teachers and leaders were using them since the beginning. Instead, he joined a company hiring superhumans, as a hot-line consultant for exotic situations, as his former allegiance to [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]' [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and leadership of the [[Utopia|Utopian]] students cataloged him as a terrorist.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 6}}

There, he met [[Thomas Shepherd (Earth-616)|Tommy Shepherd]] of the defunct [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]]. Together, they investigated a mysterious thief resembling [[Patriot (Entity) (Earth-616)|Patriot]], resulting in Speed's abduction.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 6}}

===[[Young Avengers]]===
To rescue Speed, Prodigy tracked down the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] and joined them as they followed the Patriot across the [[Multiverse]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 6}}{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 8}} After officially joining the Young Avengers, Prodigy revealed his feelings for [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]] and his bisexuality,{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 9}} helped defeat [[Mother (Interdimensional Parasite) (Earth-TRN287)|Mother]] and [[Leah (Construct) (Earth-616)|Leah]],{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 13}} and finally rescued Speed from the Patriot.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 15}}

Prodigy later auditioned for the position of Chief of Security at [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]], competing against [[Victor Mancha (Earth-616)|Victor Mancha]], [[Janice Lincoln (Earth-616)|Beetle]], and [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]]. He ultimately lost the position to Scott Lang.{{r|Ant-Man Vol 1 1}}

Along with Hulkling, Prodigy went to Noh-Var's space station to tell him that his ex-girlfriend was destroying space.{{r|Original Sins Vol 1 1}} He decided to help The Hood extract the information that affected people in the vicinity of the Watcher's eye exploding, before it killed them.{{r|Original Sins Vol 1 3}}

David attended [[Sotomayor University]] as a classmate of his former teammate, [[America Chavez (Earth-616)|America Chavez]]. They were project partners in creating an ancient revolutionary simulation. {{r|America Vol 1 1}} He helped her fight against a cyborg attack on the school.{{r|America Vol 1 2}}

===Empyre===
Tommy and David had since started dating and often went out with Hulkling. When Teddy felt lonely because Billy was off with [[Strikeforce (Earth-616)|Strikeforce]], they invited him to go out drinking at a gay bar where Tommy teased Teddy about his relationship problems with his brother. After being approached by agents of the [[Kree/Skrull Alliance (Earth-616)|Kree-Skrull alliance]], a group of Skrulls, who didn't believe he was the rightful heir to their throne, attacked the bar. Speed fought them alongside David.{{r|Lords of Empyre: Emperor Hulkling Vol 1}}

===Krakoa===
Prodigy later died and was later resurrected on [[Krakoa]] with his mutant powers restored and with no memory of what had happened to him.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 1}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 7}} He joined the all new [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations]] to solve the mystery of [[Jeanne-Marie Beaubier (Earth-616)|Aurora]]’s disappearance, and, afterwards, the team remained together to investigate other disappearances and find proof of death before the mutants were resurrected.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 1}}
[[File:David Alleyne (Earth-616) from X-Factor Vol 4 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|David's resurrection]]

The following day at their [[Boneyard (Krakoa)|HQ]], a package arrived with blood and ballerina shoes in it. Prodigy created a search engine that could search on a multiversal level, allowing him to identify the logos on the shoes as having come from the [[Mojoverse]]. With that intel, X-Factor went to the Mojoverse, understanding a mutant had been murdered there.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 2}}

There, [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]] revealed that the victim was his former teammate Sofia and that she had willingly been shot live to appeal to her fans. They then discovered that this was all part of her plan to escape the Mojoverse and bring help to rescue the other prisoners. [[Gaveedra Seven (Earth-616)|Shatterstar]], who was also there against his will, had been the one who sent them the shoes to warn them. After bringing the body back to Krakoa, [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]] proceeded with Sofia's resurrection.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 3}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 5}}

After David's boyfriend, Tommy, found out through Sofia that David had died and been resurrected by The Five,{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 6}} he paid him a visit and David insisted that he had died when Xavier's institute was attacked, but Tommy explained to him that he was with him that night and that an anonymous person had taken a photo of them and posted it and tagged him.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 7}} Later he analyzed the photo Tommy found, only to realize that it contained a hidden message from himself.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 8}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 10}}

Prodigy traveled to [[Wakanda]] during this time in order to help [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|T'Challa]] fend off an intergalactic army led by [[Erik Killmonger (Earth-616)|Erik Killmonger]]. Prodigy was put in a machine that helped him absorb the knowledge of the assembled heroes to help him think of ways for them to use their powers together.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 24}}

Back On Krakoa, the [[Morrigan (Earth-616)|Morrigan]], who had possessed [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Theresa Cassidy]], took over the Boneyard and killed most of the team members. He and [[Trevor Hawkins (Earth-616)|Eye-Boy]] escaped and later informed X-Factor of the possession.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 8}} After entering Terry's mind, he found out that Shatterstar had to be the one killing The Morrigan, leading to a rescue operation that ended with The Morrigan's death at the hands of Shatterstar and Theresa being successfully freed from her curse.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 9}}

On X-Factor's way to the Hellfire Gala, Prodigy left with a poor excuse. He went to ''Club Pepper'', where he had gone missing after being abducted by producer Buck Thatcher, a sexual predator who had been murdering young Black queer men. He was met there by Eye-Boy and told him how he had found his murderer, also revealing he hadn't had the courage to kill him. Returning the gala, he met Tommy and tried to have a good time with his boyfriend, however, fate wouldn't have it that way, as they soon discovered the dead body of [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], Tommy's mother.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 10}}

The team were sent to investigate Wanda's death with help from the X-Men and [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]], they unanimously concluded [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] was their top suspect.{{r|X-Men: The Trial of Magneto Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = Prodigy is a [[Homo superior|mutant]], who had previously lost his [[X-Gene|mutant powers]] due to the effects of [[Decimation|M-Day]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 20}}

The [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] unlocked all the knowledge in his mind that he had previously absorbed. As a result, Prodigy has access to all the knowledge and skills he had briefly obtained with his mutant power, but he cannot psychically gain new information from others.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 43}} 

He has since regained his mutant status after being killed and resurrected by [[Five (Earth-616)|the Five]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 1}}

'''Psychomimetic:''' Subconscious, uncontrolled, form of limited telepathy, allowing temporary mimicry of skills and knowledge from nearby targets.{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 4}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 1}} Prodigy could acquire mental and physical abilities, be it knowledge over a subject, a foreign language, or mastery of a fighting style. He could even predict the attacks of others in order to avoid them.{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 4|5}} However, he was unable to retain that knowledge. When the person left his immediate proximity, Prodigy no longer retained information. [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] described this mental block as a defense mechanism.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 10}} It is unknown after his resurrection by Krakoa if he still retains this mental block.
