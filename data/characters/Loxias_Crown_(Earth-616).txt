| History                 = Crown tracked down scientist [[William Fields (Earth-616)|William Fields]] to the campus of [[Empire State University]]. Arriving at his home on Christmas Eve, Crown slew Fields, but allowed [[Todd Fields (Earth-616)#Marjory Fields (Earth-616)|Marjory Fields]] and [[Todd Fields (Earth-616)|their son]] to escape. Before departing, he confronted the boy, Todd, and swore that they would meet again.

Seven years after slaying William Fields, Crown returned to ESU, and took [[Empire State University#Sydney Lanning (Earth-616)|Dr. Sydney Lanning]] and a room full of scientists hostage in Research Building Number 3, aided by a group of masked goons. Turning on an unstable energy generator built by Fields, Crown demanded that Lanning hand over the generator and Fields' notes, or else he would let the generator overload and explode, killing them all. Ordering his men to kill two students who'd just wandered in, Crown also killed a scientist who attempted to flee. Before he could make any further demands, [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] and a new S.H.O.C. burst into the room and incapacitated Crown's thugs. Recognizing S.H.O.C. as a different man than the one he knew, Crown grabbed both heroes as his hostages fled. With the generator beyond the point of no return, Crown planned to allow it to explode, bathing him in its energies and granting him phenomenal power. Distracted by a face full of web-fluid, Crown released Spider-Man and S.H.O.C., who threw him and his goons into a spatial rift, allowing S.H.O.C. to absorb the energy released by the exploding generator.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 76}}

Crown journeyed to [[Andrea Janson (Earth-616)|Andrea Janson]]'s private island, where he embraced her and inspected her new experimental subject, [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]]. Taking his lover and the living vampire to the [[Staten Island]] mansion of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] representative, [[Vincente Fortunato (Earth-616)|Vincente Fortunato]], he was given the secret identity of S.H.O.C. as "Neil Aiken" and sent to capture him. Intercepting Aiken and fellow ESU students Peter Parker and [[Abby Levine (Earth-616)|Abby Levin]] with a group of Hydra storm troopers, Crown threatened to kill Parker unless Aiken came with him. He teleported S.H.O.C., Parker, and his troops back to Fortunato's residence, leaving Levin behind.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 79}}

Crown conferred with Fortunato and Hydra leader [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] on Janson's experiments on the captive S.H.O.C.. As Fortunato and Strucker left, Crown bade farewell to Janson before teleporting away.  Returning shortly afterwards, Crown arrived to find S.H.O.C. missing and Dr. Janson slain. Swearing vengeance upon her killer [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]], Crown took a [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] airship to his apartment building, which also housed Parker, S.H.O.C., and Morbius. As his men engaged in a brutal firefight with Hammerhead's fellow gangsters, Crown took on S.H.O.C. and prepared to overload his armor, killing them all. As he casually blew away Hammerhead, darkforce energy began to destroy the building. He quickly struck down both S.H.O.C. and Spider-Man, but was prevented from finishing them off when Morbius attacked him. As they grappled, S.H.O.C. and Spider-Man sent Crown's energy field back to the Hydra ship. In the resulting explosion, the ship was destroyed, and both Crown and Morbius disappeared.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 80}}
===Hunger===
[[File:Hunger (Crown) (Earth-616) from Peter Parker Spider-Man Vol 1 7 0001.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Hunger, the [[Living Vampire]]]]
Living in the sewers beneath [[New York City]], Hunger began abducting citizens off the streets and keeping them prisoner in a subterranean chamber. Among his victims were a number of [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]], including their leader, [[Callisto (Earth-616)|Callisto]]. Hunger abducted [[Character Index/J#Jeff|Jeff]], leaving his significant other [[Character Index/M#Melissa|Melissa]] catatonic with shock. When [[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Bugle]] reporters Peter Parker and [[Elizabeth Brant (Earth-616)|Betty Brant]] investigated the scene, he knocked out Parker and kidnapped Brant. Returning to the sewers as Spider-Man and joined by [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]], the two discovered his cache of as-yet unharmed victims and soon confronted Hunger himself. Accompanied by a flock of bats, Hunger was dismayed to see his "cattle" escaping and vowed to slake his thirst on the two heroes instead. Grabbing them, he was confused when Spider-Man called him a "vampire", and let them go when he was attacked from behind by [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Flash Thompson]], who had followed the web-slinger. Discarding Thompson and snatching Marrow once more, Hunger was denied a meal once more when Spider-Man pummeled him. His mind clouded, Hunger retreated, transforming into energy and blasting through the ceiling and into the sky, accompanied by his bats. Hunger was then re-apprehended and contained by agents of [[Stewart Ward (Earth-616)|Stewart Ward]].{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 4}}

Hunger crashed a meeting between the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]], [[Giacomo Fortunato (Earth-616)|Jimmy-Six]], and a number of lower captains of [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia families]]. Setting the building on fire, Hunger slew a number of the captains, but Fisk and Six escaped. Transforming a number of mobsters into his thralls, Hunger began damaging the operations of the Maggia. [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]], Spider-Man, and a gangster named [[Giacomo Fortunato (Earth-616)#Mutt (Earth-616)|Mutt]] tracked Hunger down to an abandoned [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]] plant, destroying nearly all of his vampire gangsters along the way. Destroying the firearms of Mutt and Blade, Hunger used his energy powers to summon Spider-Man and Blade to him, where he planned to use them to replenish his vampire army. Before he could do so, Mutt slew [[Giacomo Fortunato (Earth-616)#T-Bone (Earth-616)|T-Bone]], Hunger's last remaining thrall. Weakened, Hunger fled.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 7}}
