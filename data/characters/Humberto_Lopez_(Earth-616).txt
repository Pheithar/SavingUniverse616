===Origin===
Humberto Lopez grew up with a love of super heroes and a desire to one day become an [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avenger]]. His parents, both renowned paleontologists, taught him about [[dinosaurs]] in hopes of leading him into the field of paleontology as well.{{r|Avengers Academy #6}}

[[File:Humberto Lopez (Earth-616) and Fossilized Amulet 001.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Reptil showing his [[Fossilized Amulet]]]]
While accompanying his parents on an archeological dig, the Lopezes discovered a [[Fossilized Amulet]]. 'Berto eventually took possession of the fossil.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}}

During another archeological dig, 'Berto's parents mysteriously disappeared without a trace. Although they were declared dead, 'Berto continued to hold out hope that they would return. With his parents gone, 'Berto went to live with his paternal grandfather in Sparks, [[Nevada (State)|Nevada]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}}

'Berto continued to carry the fossil with him until one day a rockslide occurred nearly burying him. He ran as fast as he could, and it wasn't until he was far away that he noticed his legs had transformed into those of a [[Dinosaurs|dinosaur]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}}

===Initiative and Avengers Academy===
Around the time of the [[Secret War|Skrull invasion]], 'Berto registered with the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] under the codename '''[[Reptil]]'''. However, due to the chaos surrounding the invasion, Reptil was not immediately activated or trained.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}}

When [[Vincent Stegron (Earth-616)|Stegron]] began using dinosaurs to attack [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] bases around the U.S., [[Valerie Cooper (Earth-616)|Dr. Valerie Cooper]] placed [[Greer Nelson (Earth-616)|Tigra]] in charge of a small squad, and despite his lack of training, Reptil was ordered to be on the roster. Reptil was able to receive some accelerated training over a few days in [[Camp Hammond]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}}

[[File:Humberto Lopez (Earth-616) and Moon Boy (Earth-78411) from Avengers The Initiative Featuring Reptil Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Reptil rescuing [[Moon-Boy (Earth-78411)|Moon Boy]]]]
With the help of [[Wernher von Blitzschlag (Earth-616)|Baron von Blitzschlag]], Reptil's empathic powers allowed the team to locate Stegron. The squad was eventually able to stop Stegron, but after learning that Stegron was merely attempting to rescue [[Moon-Boy (Earth-78411)|Moon Boy]], Reptil insisted on reuniting him with [[Devil Dinosaur (Earth-78411)|Devil Dinosaur]]. With help from Tigra, Reptil was able to stage Moon Boy's death and escape though in doing so he sacrificed his opportunity at active duty in the Initiative.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}}

Tigra contacted [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]], and he and Reptil accompanied Moon Boy back to the [[Savage Land]]. After Moon Boy was reunited with Devil Dinosaur, Ka-Zar promised to aid Reptil in finding his parents.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}}

Reptil was eventually fed false leads on his parents whereabouts from [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]], and led into a trap. Osborn proceeded to torture and experiment on Reptil for several months in an attempt to push his powers to their limits.{{r|Enter the Heroic Age #1}}{{r|Avengers Academy #6}}

[[File:Avengers Academy Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Reptil joining the Avengers Academy]]
Shortly after the arrest of Norman Osborn, [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] agents attempted to destroy all evidence of their crimes by killing everyone in the detention center. Luckily, Reptil was able to escape and was quickly rescued by [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Wasp]], Tigra, and [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]] to be recruited to the newly formed [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]].{{r|Enter the Heroic Age #1}}{{r|Avengers Academy #1}}

Sometime during or shortly after his imprisonment, Reptil's fossil embedded itself into his chest.{{r|Avengers Academy #6}} Reptil was unanimously elected class leader{{r|Avengers Academy #6}} soon after their identities were exposed to the public.{{r|Avengers Academy #5}} He also began having a romantic relationship with [[Jeanne Foucault (Earth-616)|Finesse]].{{r|Avengers Academy #3}}{{r|Avengers Academy #6}} 

[[File:Humberto Lopez (Earth-616) and Fossilized Amulet 002.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Fossilized Amulet]] embedded in Reptil's chest]]
Reptil continued to try and push his powers to their limits, but remained unable to fully transform into a dinosaur until he lost control during a battle with [[Marvin Flumm (Earth-616)|Mentallo]]. Wasp theorized Reptil's repressed emotional turmoil was preventing him from accessing his full potential. During a one on one conference with [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]], Reptil finally began to discuss some of his emotional problems surrounding his parents and Osborn.{{r|Avengers Academy #6}} Despite facing some of his trouble, Reptil continued to feel insecure about his leadership.{{r|Avengers Academy #9}} 

When the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] faced off against [[Michael Korvac (Earth-691)|Korvac]], [[Carina Tivan (Earth-616)|Carina Walters]] used her manipulation time and space to allow the Avengers Academy students to inhabit the bodies of their thirty-year-old counter parts to use the full potential of their powers to stop Korvac. In [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-11511)|his adult form]], Reptil's power were augmented by [[Pym Particles]] allowing him to transform into full sized dinosaurs.{{r|Avengers Academy #11|#12}} After Korvac was defeated, Carina returned the students to their young bodies, but Reptil remained in [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-11511)|his adult body]]{{r|Avengers Academy #12}} because of a secret desire to be more powerful to lead and protect his team. However, [[Anya Corazon (Earth-616)|Spider-Girl]] was eventually able to convince him to revert to his true body.{{r|Avengers Academy #13}} 

===Fear Itself and Time Travel Possession===
[[File:Humberto Lopez (Earth-616) and Carl Creel (Earth-616) 001.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Reptil battling [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Greithoth]] in the [[Infinite Avengers Mansion]]]]
Reptil fought along side the other Avengers Academy students against the forces of the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]] and [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Skadi]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].{{r|Avengers Academy #15}} He later helped defend the [[Infinite Avengers Mansion]] against [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Greithoth]] and [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Skirn]].{{r|Avengers Academy #17|#19}}

Shortly after the Avengers Academy relocated to the [[Avengers Compound]] near [[Los Angeles]], [[California (State)|California]] and expanded enrollment, Reptilâ€™s mind was replaced with that of [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-11511)|his older self]].{{r|Avengers Academy #21}}

[[File:Jeanne Foucault (Earth-11511), Humberto Lopez (Earth-11511), and Jennifer Takeda (Earth-81320) from Avengers Academy Vol 1 23 001.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Young Reptil's mind trapped in his adult body in the [[Earth-11511|future]]]]
The adult [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-11511)|Reptil]] was sent back in time by [[Henry Pym (Earth-11511)|Giant-Man]] to ensure that [[James Marks (Earth-616)|Hybrid]] would kill all of the new students and Tigra thereby reuniting [[Jocasta (Earth-11511)|Jocasta]] and [[Madeline Berry (Earth-11511)|Veil]] with the Avengers Academy and ensure their [[Earth-11511|future]]. Fortunately, Reptil and the others changed their minds at the last minute, rescued everyone, and defeated Hybrid.{{r|Avengers Academy #23|#26}}

While trapped in the [[Earth-11511|future]], Reptil learned that he and Finesse had a [[Maria Lopez (Earth-11511)|daughter]],{{r|Avengers Academy #23}} and upon returning to his time he tried to rekindle his relationship with Finesse though Finesse turned him down.{{r|Avengers Academy #28}}{{r|Avengers Academy #30}}{{r|Avengers Academy #38}}

When [[Old Lace (Earth-TRN846)|Old Lace]] went missing, the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]] came to the Avengers Academy looking for help. Using his amulet, Reptil was able to locate Old Lace in the [[Savage Land]] and helped to reunite her with her friends.{{r|Avengers Academy #27|#28}}

===AvX and Murderworld===
Despite some students of the Avengers Academy siding with the younger [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] during the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|war between the Avengers and X-Men]], Reptil continued to side with the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Academy #29|#31}}

[[File:Humberto Lopez (Earth-616) and Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616).jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616)|Jeremy Briggs]] ripping the [[Fossilized Amulet]] from Reptil's chest]]
While the Avengers Academy temporarily closed during the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|war between the Avengers and X-Men]], Reptil and [[Ava Ayala (Earth-616)|White Tiger]] travelled to [[Florida (State)|Florida]] to meet with [[Jennifer Kale (Earth-616)|Jennifer Kale]] of [[Alternate Reality Monitoring and Operational Response Agency (Earth-616)|A.R.M.O.R.]] to receive insight about their magical artifacts.{{r|Avengers Academy #34}}

The pair soon joined the rest of their team in [[Manhattan]], where [[Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616)|Jeremy Briggs]] tricked them into being depowered. [[Lisa Molinari (Earth-616)|Coat of Arms]] claimed to have tapped into the power of the fossil and [[Ava Ayala (Earth-616)|White Tiger]]'s [[Amulets of Power]], but Reptil and White Tiger were able to gain them back by embracing their true potential and learning about the origins of the artifacts in a vision.{{r|Avengers Academy #36}} Bonding over the similarities of their powers, Reptil and White Tiger even began the glimmer of a romantic relationship somewhat to the distress of Finesse.{{r|Avengers Academy #39}}{{r|Avengers Arena #13}}

Reptil was among the sixteen young super heros kidnapped by [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] to battle to the death in his new [[Murderworld]].{{r|Avengers Arena #1}} To prevent suspicion, Arcade made Repitl's disappearance look like he had left to search for his parents.{{r|Avengers Arena #13}}

[[File:Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616) and Humberto Lopez (Earth-616) recovering in Murderworld.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat]] caring for Reptil on a beach in [[Murderworld]]]]
Originally, Reptil journeyed out with his classmates [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]], [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat]], and [[Juston Seyfert (Earth-616)|Juston]].{{r|Avengers Arena #1|#4}} Later the Avengers Academy briefly joined with the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]] [[Nico Minoru (Earth-616)|Nico]] and [[Chase Stein (Earth-616)|Chase]],{{r|Avengers Arena #4}} but the disappearance of Juston{{r|Avengers Arena #3}} and the near fatal attack of Reptil by an [[Katy Bashir (Earth-616)|Apex]] controlled [[Rebecca Ryker (Earth-616)|Death Locket]], left Hazmat and X-23 paranoid and scared resulting in them breaking ties with the Runaways.{{r|Avengers Arena #4}}

Reptil slowly recovered as he, Hazmat, and X-23 trekked to Arcade's safe zone until Hazmat accidentally set off a [[Trigger Scent]] bomb. Reptil and Hazmat narrowly escaped X-23's rampage,{{r|Avengers Arena #6}} but Reptil collapsed on a safe zone beach with Hazmat. The pair remained there for two weeks while Reptil recovered. It wasn't until Nico's spell sent [[Nara (Earth-616)|Nara]], [[Aiden (Earth-616)|Anachronism]], [[Cullen Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Bloodstone]], [[Camille Benally (Earth-616)|Cammi]], and X-23 to their location, that the pair left, deciding to aid in battling to stop Apex and Arcade.{{r|Avengers Arena #11}}

Reptil acquired near-fatal injuries rescuing his fellow Murder World survivors from [[Jennifer Takeda (Earth-616)|Hazmat]]'s nuclear detonation.{{r|Avengers Arena Vol 1 18}} He was later airlifted for medical treatment by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=49441 Dennis Hopeless Exits "AVENGERS ARENA" To Go "UNDERCOVER"]</ref>

===Search for Tony Stark===
Reptil, fully recuperated from the radiation, was shown sparring with [[Brandon Sharpe (Earth-616)|Striker]] after having joined [[Leonardo da Vinci (Earth-616)|Leonardo da Vinci]]'s new program intended to take the place of the now-defunct S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 600}}

=== King In Black===
When Knull invaded planet Earth, Reptil assisted civilians caught in between the madness. While helping an elderly woman get home, he was attacked by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] who had mistaken him for a Symbiote Dragon. Reptile and Spider-Man then worked together to get the woman home to [[Staten Island]]. However, on their way, they saw a ferry being attacked and decided to help. As Spider-Man helped come up with a plan, Reptil engaged the dragon in the water. While defeated he managed to hold it off long enough for Spider-Man to destroy it. Briefly celebrating their victory, the woman decided to remain with the ferry to get home, and Reptil and Spider-Man went back out to saving more lives.{{r|King in Black: Spider-Man Vol 1 1}}

Reptil's powers were activated by the [[Fossilized Amulet]], which was discovered by his parents.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}} The jewel was [[magic]]ally created by the [[Hag of the Pits (Earth-78411)|Hag of the Pits]] to imbue Reptil with the strength of the prehistoric animals he will one day have to protect.{{r|Avengers Academy #6}}{{r|Avengers Academy #28}} His powers were later augmented with [[Pym Particles]].{{r|Avengers Academy #14}} His powers include:
* '''''[[Shapeshifting|Prehistoric Animal Metamorphosis]]:''''' Originally, Reptil could only transform certain parts of his body into different aspects of [[dinosaurs]] such as wings of a pterodactyl, the tail of a stegosaurus, the head of a parasaur, the legs of a velociraptor, etc. While inhabited by his [[Humberto Lopez (Earth-11511)|future self]], he showed he was also able to turn into prehistoric insects. And he could also only maintain one transformation at a time.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}} These transformations could even be limited to enhancing senses such as vision, hearing, and olfactory senses.{{r|Enter the Heroic Age #1}}{{r|Avengers Academy #6}}{{r|Avengers Academy #23}}{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}} Eventually Reptil was able to fully transform into a complete dinosaur though due to the conservation of mass, Reptil could not alter his size.{{r|Avengers Academy #6}} As his powers progressed, Reptil discovered his transformations were not limited to dinosaurs, but that he could indeed transform into any prehistoric animal{{r|Avengers Academy #22}}{{r|Avengers Academy #28}} or insect.{{r|Avengers Academy #17}}{{r|Avengers Academy #23}}
* '''''Empathic Prehistoric Animal Connection:''''' Reptil can sense the presence and emotions of [[dinosaurs]]. However, he cannot exert control over them.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}}
* '''''Size Alteration:''''' Reptil's powers were eventually augmented with [[Pym Particles]] allowing him to increase his size and transform into full-sized dinosaur{{r|Avengers Academy #6}}{{r|Avengers Academy #14}} and also shrink down into smaller animals.{{r|Avengers Academy #17}}{{r|Avengers Academy #23}}{{r|Avengers Academy #29}}
* '''''[[Healing Factor|Accelerated Healing]]:''''' After being electrocuted by [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]], Reptil discovered that he heals much faster when in his dinosaur forms.{{r|Avengers Academy #17}}

* Reptil has mentioned that the fossil will not grant others the ability to transform into dinosaurs, and that he cannot transform without it.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}}
* Reptil's skin always changes into a scaly red while he transforms into his various [[dinosaurs]]. This is possibly due to the red energy signature of his [[Fossilized Amulet]].
* Both [[Greer Grant (Earth-616)|Tigra]]{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil #1}} and [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]]{{r|Avengers Academy #6}} have theorized that Reptil's fossil is merely a catalyst for his powers and not the source, but there is no evidence to support this claim.
