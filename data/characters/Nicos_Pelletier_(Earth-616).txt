Guillotine was one of three human-enhancement experiments created by Hydra. [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]] released these experiments into the world and sent three mercenaries after them in a Darwinian test of strength to see who would emerge victorious. Guillotine went on to become one of Strucker's lieutenants.{{r|Daredevil Annual #7}}
