===Early Life===
Wyatt Wingfoot was born on the Keewazi reservation in [[Oklahoma (State)|Oklahoma]], a member of the [[Keewazi (Earth-616)|Keewazi]] tribe{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 138}} of Native Americans and a descendant of the [[Comanche Nation (Earth-616)|Comanche]] tribe.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 54}} Wyatt's father, [[William Wingfoot (Earth-616)|Will Wingfoot]], was the greatest American decathlon champion of his time. Wyatt's grandfather was [[Silent Fox (Earth-616)|Silent Fox]], the chief of the Keewazi tribe, until his death.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 269}}

===Adventures with Johnny===
After attending a mission school near Tulsa, Oklahoma, Wyatt Wingfoot entered [[Metro College]], which is across the river from Manhattan. There Wingfoot first met another incoming freshman, Jonathan "Johnny" Storm, who, as the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]], was a member of the team of superhuman adventurers known as the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]. Storm and Wingfoot became roommates at Metro College's Northfield Dormitory, and quickly became close friends.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 50}}

When T'Challa, the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]], ruler of [[Wakanda]], first invited the Fantastic Four to visit his country, Johnny Storm asked his teammates if Wingfoot could come along, and they enthusiastically agreed. To test himself in preparation for confronting his archenemy, [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Ulysses Klaw]], the Black Panther attacked and trapped the Fantastic Four. However, the Panther underestimated Wingfoot, since the latter had no superhuman powers. Wingfoot freed the Fantastic Four, who then confronted the Panther.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 52}} T'Challa then became friends with the Fantastic Four and Wingfoot, all of whom helped the Panther in battling Klaw soon afterwards.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 53}}

Wyatt then joined the Human Torch in his journey to free the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] from their Negative Zone Barrier.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 54}}

Wyatt Wingfoot became a good friend to the members of the Fantastic Four and participated in many of their adventures over the years, always proving to be a valuable ally.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 269}}

Although Johnny Storm did not complete his studies at Metro College, Wingfoot finished his course work there and graduated.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 138}}

===Rejoining the Fantastic Four===
After Chief Silent Fox had been dead seven months, the Keewazi Council of Elders was about to make Wyatt Wingfoot the tribe's new chief. However, the coming of [[Terminus (Destroyer) (Earth-616)|Terminus]] to destroy the Earth and enslave humanity reminded Wyatt of his love for adventure, so he chose to decline the title of chief of his tribe, at least for the foreseeable future. Spending more time with the Fantastic Four, Wyatt grew closer with their newest member, [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]], who was replacing the Thing at the time, and, eventually, the two started dating.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 269|270}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 278}}

===Carlton Beatrice===
At some point, Wyatt and She-Hulk separated while he was living with the Fantastic Four. After their breakup, Wyatt enrolled in law school, but events transpired that led to him and She-Hulk getting back together and even engaged. Not long after, he returned to his tribe's reservation accompanied by She-Hulk so she could meet his family, only to discover that the tribe was--once again--in danger from the corporate meddling of a man called [[Carlton Beatrice (Earth-616)|Carlton Beatrice]], who had visited decades before attempting to take advantage of the Keewazi's natural resources.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk in Ceremony Vol 1 1}}

After learning this, Wyatt, She-Hulk and Wyatt's sister, [[Rain Falling West (Earth-616)|Rain Falling West]], found and fought against Beatrice, but when he stole Wyatt's soul and threatened to destroy it, She-Hulk struck a deal with him--she would give him the basket he had been seeking, which once belonged to Wyatt's parents and had the potential for great power, in return for Wyatt's soul. Beatrice accepted and Wyatt was saved, but now Beatrice had great power and sought to steal the souls of every living being on earth.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk in Ceremony Vol 1 2}}

[[File:Jennifer Walters (Earth-616) and Wyatt Wingfoot (Earth-616) from Sensational She-Hulk in Ceremony Vol 1 2 cover.jpg|200px|thumb|left]]
He nearly succeeded, but in desperation, Wyatt finally underwent training from his grandmother to learn the art of woman's medicine, giving himself a new form with long hair and traditional clothing. In this form he and She-Hulk united, holding the basket that had belonged to his father aloft in the air, together, and their unity freed the world from Beatrice's grip, returning the souls of the living to their rightful place.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk in Ceremony Vol 1 2}}

After all this, they could not prevent the Keewazi's reservation land from being seized: their treaty with the government was rescinded completely through Beatrice's influence before his defeat. Legally, they had no recourse, and the corporation had powerful weapons that not even She-Hulk could hold her own against.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk in Ceremony Vol 1 2}}

In despair at losing her people's homes and land, Wyatt's grandmother Roberta passed away. In the grim aftermath, as Wyatt's tribe left their stolen land, Wyatt and She-Hulk decided that they weren't ready to rekindle their romance after all, and that Wyatt needed to stay behind with his people after the loss of their homes. They parted on good terms, as She-Hulk returned to New York and Wyatt stayed behind in his new role.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk in Ceremony Vol 1 2}}

===Back with familiar faces===
Never apart from She-Hulk's life for very long, Wingfoot occasionally appeared by her side, and they rekindled their intimate relationship over the holidays, when She-Hulk stopped to visit Wyatt on her way to visit her father.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk Vol 1 36}} A few weeks later, Wyatt returned to New York with her to attend to some business in the city, and stayed with her for some time in her apartment.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk Vol 1 37}}

For a time, Wyatt accompanied her in her various adventures. Eventually, however, he felt the pull of responsibility and informed She-Hulk that he had to return home--that he was in fact leaving that night to return to his role as Chief. She understood, and in a fourth wall break, it turned out that her comic had been canceled anyway, so in the end, they were all removed from the page and packed away.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk Vol 1 60}}

In spite of their separation, Wyatt continued to occasionally reconnect not just with She-Hulk (both platonically and romantically), but with his friends at the Fantastic Four as well, especially Johnny Storm. He participated in an archaeology dig near his reservation with both She-Hulk and Johnny,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 394}} joined them while the Fantastic Force was active,{{r|Fantastic Force Vol 1 12}} and partnered with the Fantastic Four at least once more when his tribe was once again in danger,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 26}} among other meetings.

He continued his off-and-on friendship/romance with She-Hulk throughout the years, going on multiple dates with her,{{r|She-Hulks Vol 1 4}}{{r|FF Vol 2 4}} though ultimately their relationship did not continue and they grew apart, their once-passionate romance evolving into a thing of the past.{{r|Hulk Vol 4 11}}

Still considered a good friend of the Fantastic Four, Wyatt seemingly roomed with Johnny Storm once more,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 1}} attended Benjamin Grimm's bachelor party, and was present at the fairly private wedding of Ben Grimm and Alicia Masters.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 5}}
