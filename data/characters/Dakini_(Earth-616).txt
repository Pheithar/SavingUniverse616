| History                 = Dakini was a tracker and assassin working for [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker's]] Hydra. When three genetic experiments escaped Hydra custody, Dakini was sent to hunt down [[Cassandra Romulus (Earth-616)|Cassandra Romulus]].{{r|Daredevil Annual #7}} She refused to work with her fellow hunter [[Ron Takimoto (Earth-616)|Ron Takimoto]], preferring to act alone in pursuit of her prey.{{r|Punisher Annual Vol 1 #4}}

Dakini was a fanatic and decided the genetic freaks from the experiments were a blight on Hydra's name. As a result, she chose to ignore Strucker's orders to take Romulus alive. Dakini got into a three-way battle with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and Romulus, where she suffered serious injuries and was captured, with her survival uncertain.{{r|Captain America Annual #10}}
