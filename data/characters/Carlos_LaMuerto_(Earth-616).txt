===Early Life===
Allegedly, for over 700 years the title and powers of the "[[Black Tarantula]]" have been passed down from father to son. Each Black Tarantula supposedly separates the male heir from their mother at an early age to begin a life of vigorous training.{{Citation}} The current Black Tarantula, Carlos LaMuerto, a crime lord in [[South America]] and parts of [[Europe]], met his Brazilian wife, [[Marina Caches (Earth-616)|Marina Caches]], while attending an American graduate school. They had a child, [[Fabian LaMuerto (Earth-616)|Fabian LaMuerto]]. Upon discovering her husband’s illegal activities, Marina filed for divorce and fled with her son. Marina settled in [[New York City|New York]] where she became a criminal psychology teacher at [[Empire State University]] and began dating [[Dante Rigoletto (Earth-616)|Dante Rigoletto]], unaware that Dante was the nephew of the infamous mobster, [[Don Rigoletto (Original) (Earth-616)|Don Rigoletto]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 432}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 436}}

===Coming to America===
Discovering his ex-wife to be in the New York area, the Black Tarantula launched a campaign primarily to locate his son while establishing a foothold in the lucrative New York underworld market in the absence of the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin of Crime (Wilson Fisk)]]. He dispatched his powerful agent, [[El Uno (Earth-616)|El Uno]], with a gang of his men to violently introduce himself to his competition, the new [[Jacob Conover (Earth-616)|Rose]]. Humiliated by El Uno, the Rose’s assassin [[Delilah (Earth-616)|Delilah]] killed El Uno and returned his severed head to the Black Tarantula. The Black Tarantula dispatched [[Madam Qwa (Earth-616)|Madam Qwa]] and the [[True Believers (Cult) (Earth-616)|True Believers]] -- a Korean cult of ninjas who defected from [[Hand (Earth-616)|the Hand]] -- to harass the Rose by killing a former colleague, [[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Daily Bugle]] editor [[Joseph Robertson (Earth-616)|Joe Robertson]], while framing the Rose. With opposition from the Hand ninjas, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], and [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]], the Black Tarantula's agents failed to kill Robertson.{{citation}}

The Black Tarantula went to New York to personally attend to matters. The Rose hired the remaining True Believers under Madam Qwa's brother, [[Master Zei (Earth-616)|Master Zei]], to resurrect [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] as an ally. However, Zei intended to turn Doctor Octopus over to the Black Tarantula, but was killed during the resurrection ceremony. As Madam Qwa demanded revenge, the Black Tarantula conceded, breaking Delilah's neck, then healing her with a stern warning for the Rose. Meanwhile, his diminutive and loyal assistant, [[Chesbro (Earth-616)|Chesbro]], located Marina, who had been teaching Spider-Man’s wife, [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson-Parker]]. The Tarantula invaded [[Vincente Fortunato (Earth-616)|Don Vincente Fortunato's]] mansion, brokering a deal for portions of the Rose’s hijacking operations in exchange for sending a dire message to Spider-Man. Offering mercy only upon learning Spider-Man was searching to rescue a kidnapped child ([[Norman Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn Jr.]]), the Tarantula beat Spider-Man nearly to death and departed with his mask. He offered the mask to Fortunato, who recounted his partially correct understanding of the legendary Black Tarantula's secret origin, beginning with [[Marco Polo (Earth-616)|Marco Polo's]] expeditions to the Orient. Peter Parker (in four alternate disguises while a bounty was on his head), tackled Black Tarantula's operatives, [[Bloodscream (Earth-616)|Bloodscream]] and [[Roughouse (Earth-616)|Roughouse]], who had incapacitated Delilah while on assignment to kidnap Marina Caches. Marina fled to Dante's godfather, Don Fortunato, for protection. The Black Tarantula raided Fortunato's mansion, tearing through the mobster's defenses and Killdroids. Spider-Man arrived and stopped the Rose from shooting the Black Tarantula in the back. Spider-Man's heroics and his wife's pleading on behalf of Fabian persuaded the Black Tarantula to depart and return another day. The Black Tarantula fled during a raid on a [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]] facility used to augment criminal agents with superhuman abilities located on his Bolivian jungle property.{{citation}}

The Black Tarantula was incarcerated in the U.S. and kept depowered in [[Ryker's Island|Rykers Prison]] along with [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], the Kingpin, [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]], and the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] where he was nearly killed by [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]]. Black Tarantula was released early from prison due to a record of good behavior and prison overpopulation. Carlos went to Matt Murdock for a job; Matt had him work with [[Dakota North (Earth-616)|Dakota North]], an investigator working for [[Nelson and Murdock (Earth-616)|Nelson & Murdock]]. Carlos, who was dissatisfied with the job, longed for a more hands-on approach to stopping crime. Matt noticed and took Carlos with him to battle a [[Yakuza (Earth-616)|Yakuza]] gang working in [[Hell's Kitchen]]. The leader of the Yakuza gang fled from the attack; Daredevil chased him but failed to catch him because he had the flu, diminishing his abilities. Black Tarantula and Daredevil surveyed the scene, noticing a large pile of money. Black Tarantula said that he would like to take the money but Daredevil stopped him. Later, Black Tarantula took on a gang whose leader was hired to kill an old woman; this leader was a vengeful former recruit of Black Tarantula. Years earlier, Carlos had personally invited him into his gang, naming him "[[Luis Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Little Loco]]". After Black Tarantula took care of the gang, he killed Loco by choking him with the money he was paid for killing the women. Daredevil showed up at the scene, asking what Black Tarantula had done, Black Tarantula then told him that he planned on taking the rest of the money from the hideout. Daredevil attempted to stop him but was knocked out with a single punch from Black Tarantula. Black Tarantula collected the money, getting ready to leave, but before he left he knelt in front of Daredevil and healed the flu he'd been afflicted with. Black Tarantula left the money he took from the gang in a church, with a note saying "Help people with this."{{citation}}

One morning Carlos was attacked in his apartment by a group of Hand assassins. His fight was observed by [[Maki Matsumoto (Earth-616)|Lady Bullseye]], evaluating his performance. Some time after he defeated the assassins, he was captured by [[Izo (Earth-616)|Master Izo]] and brought to Matt Murdock's apartment.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 112}} After some explanation, the group separated and Master Izo and Black Tarantula were tracked by a Hand ninja. As they chased after him they were led to pictures of some of the greatest martial artists including Carlos himself, [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Angela del Toro (Earth-616)|White Tiger]], and [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 113}}

While out patrolling, Black Tarantula ran into [[Angela del Toro (Earth-616)|White Tiger]] being attacked by Hand ninjas exactly like he had been. After diving in to help her he was killed by White Tiger and resurrected by the Hand as an assassin.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 114}} Carlos then lead an attack against Daredevil at his home along with White Tiger, Lady Bullseye, and [[Hirochi (Earth-616)|Lord Hirochi]]. Daredevil was joined by Master Izo and [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], and together they fought off the Hand. Black Tarantula defeated Iron Fist but stopped White Tiger from killing him, giving the excuse that he did not want the competition.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 115}}

Black Tarantula and White Tiger were next ordered to kill [[Franklin Nelson (Earth-616)|Foggy Nelson]] by Lady Bullseye,{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 119}} hired by [[Leland Owlsley (Earth-616)|The Owl]]. Black Tarantula instead saved Foggy's life and then battled White Tiger, attempting to cure her of the Hand's influence.{{r|Daredevil #500}}

===[[Shadowland]]===
When Matt Murdock took over leadership of the Hand, Black Tarantula became Matt Murdock's lieutenant alongside White Tiger. He lead the Hand in North America and oversaw the construction of [[Shadowland]] while Matt and White Tiger were in [[Japan]], meeting high ranking Hand leaders from across the globe and discussing Murdock's vision of a more heroic Hand.{{r|Shadowland #3}}

While New York was in crisis, Black Tarantula was informed by White Tiger to execute looters, but became confused, seeing that something was wrong with Daredevil. White Tiger, still possessed by the Hand, stabbed Black Tarantula in the back and tossed him over the edge of Shadowland to fall onto a vehicle, leaving him for dead.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 510}}

After ''Shadowland'', it was revealed that Black Tarantula was still alive, having been cared for by [[Linda Carter (Earth-616)|Night Nurse]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 512}}

*'''Superhuman Stamina''': Black Tarantula can exert himself at peak capacity for at least 24 hours.

*'''Superhuman Durability''': Black Tarantula possesses durability far beyond that of a human.

His skin is highly durable to the point his nearly-bullet proof.
 
*'''Superhuman Agility''': His balance, coordination, agility and dexterity is beyond the physical limits of the finest human acrobat. His agility is such that is on par with someone like Spider-Man.
