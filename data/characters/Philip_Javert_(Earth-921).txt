| History                 = Philip Javert, as the [[Swordsman]], had been a member of [[Earth-921|his world]]'s [[Avengers (Earth-921)|Avengers]]. Like the [[Earth-616]] [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]], Philip had a history with [[Clinton Barton (Earth-921)|Hawkeye]] and was championed for membership in the group by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-921)|Thor]].{{r|Avengers #344}}

When his world was destroyed, Swordsman was then was recruited by [[Dane Whitman (Earth-374)|Proctor]] to serve as one of his [[Gatherers (Multiverse)|Gatherers]]. Swordsman joined, unaware that Proctor himself was responsible for the damage as part of his mad campaign to murder every existing counterpart of the [[Eternals (Homo immortalis)|Eternal]] [[Sersi (Earth-616)|Sersi]].{{r|Avengers #343|344}}{{r|Avengers #375}}

When Proctor's forces reached [[Earth-616]], Javert and another Gatherer, [[Magdalene (Earth-9201)|Magdalene]], began to doubt their leader. Swordsman was captured by the Avengers, but treated with respect.{{r|Avengers #356}} Magdalene wanted him rescued, but Proctor wanted to renew his old relationship with her, so he sent the [[Vision (Earth-932)|Anti-Vision]] to infiltrate the Avengers and assassinate Javert.{{r|Avengers #362}} The Gatherer failed and soon both Swordsman and Magdalene fully abandoned Proctor and became honorary associates of the Avengers.{{r|Avengers #363|364}}

[[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|"Kang" (Immortus)]]'s forces attacked Javert and attempted to replace him with a [[Swordsman (Space Phantom) (Earth-616)|Space Phantom]] (who previously impersonated the [[Cotati|Elder Cotati Swordsman]]) after taking him to what appeared to be the [[Cotati]] garden.{{r|Avengers #391|392}}

After assisting the Avengers on several missions, Javert and [[Magdalene (Earth-9201)|Magdalene]] left Earth with the help of [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], seeking to find a new home for themselves in another dimension.{{r|Avengers/Squadron Supreme Annual Vol 1 '98}}
