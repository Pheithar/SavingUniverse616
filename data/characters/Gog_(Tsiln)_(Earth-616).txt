| History                 = Although native to the planet [[Broi]] in the [[Wyllys]] system of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy,{{r|Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone (and the Monster Hunters) Vol 1 1}} the [[Tsiln]] who came to be known as '''Gog''' was born in the realm of [[Haizlip]] and given to a [[Haizli]] prince as a pet, while another Tsilin was given to the princess. When the Haizli engaged in civil war, the loyalist populace was evacuated; however, the cargo ship carrying the Tsilin crash-landed on [[Earth]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 42}}

[[File:Gog (Tsiln) (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 42 004.jpg|thumb|left|Gog with his original master]]

The crash site was discovered by [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 104}} who named the creature after the biblical [[Gog (Deity) (Earth-616)|Gog]],{{r|Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone (and the Monster Hunters) Vol 1 1}} and raised it as his own,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 104}} until one day he had it take [[Gwendolyne Stacy (Earth-616)|Gwen Stacy]] hostage when she, [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]], [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]], and [[Mr. Calkin (Earth-616)|Mr. Calkin]] were on a mission in the [[Savage Land]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 103}}

With the help of [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]], Spider-Man, in an attempt to rescue Stacy, seemingly outwitted Gog when the alien fell into quicksand,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 104}} but Gog was in fact rescued by Ka-Zar's brother, the [[Parnival Plunder (Earth-616)|Plunderer]]. The Plunderer used Gog to help commit crimes, until the creature grew bored, and wandered away.{{r|Astonishing Tales Vol 1 17|19}}

Gog was later forced by [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] to join the third incarnation of the [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Six]]. After the team's defeat, [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] shrunk Gog down to a smaller size,{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 22|23}} using [[Pym Particles]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 42}} and returned the creature to the realm of Haizlip.{{r|Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone (and the Monster Hunters) Vol 1 1}}

However, Gog's new diminutive size left him an outcast and he fled, ending up on [[Earth-177]]. He came under the mental control of the native [[Otto Octavius (Earth-177)|Doctor Octopus]] and [[Sinister Six (Earth-177)|Sinister Six]]. He was freed by the [[Web-Warriors (Earth-001)|Web Warriors]] after they revealed the truth to him and restored himelf to his true size and returned to Haizlip {{r|Spider-Man: Enter the Spider-Verse Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Gog (Tsiln) (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 42 008.jpg|thumb|left|Watching his master die]]

There Gog witnessed the end of the Haizli civil war, as the queen had discovered the [[Lifeline Tablet]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 42}} which had been banished to her realm by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]],{{r|Spider-Man: Lifeline Vol 1 3}} and she believed would aid her faction in battle; however, the prince died in the invasion. The queen then shattered the Lifeline Tablet and tasked Gog with returning the fragments to Earth, asking that he guard one piece to ensure that it did not fall into the wrong hands.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 42}}

After [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]] rendered Gog unconscious with a sleeperang, Peter and [[Jamie Tolentino (Earth-616)|Jamie]] fashioned him with an [[Inhibitor Collar]] to prevent him from using the Pym Particles, then Peter and Fred brought Gog home to [[Randolph Robertson (Earth-616)|Randy Robertson]] for the trio to keep as a pet.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 43}}

'''Size Reduction:''' Because of the [[Pym Particles]] in his bloodstream, Gog can reduce himself in size, down to just a few feet tall.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 43}}

'''Size Addition:''' In addition to being able to shrink, Gog can grow in size as well, up to a towering three-hundred feet tall.{{r|Marvel Monsters: From the Files of Ulysses Bloodstone (and the Monster Hunters) Vol 1 1}}

* When and how the events of {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 42}} possibly relate to those of {{cl|Spider-Man: Enter the Spider-Verse Vol 1 1}}, in which Gog traveled to [[Earth-177]] and joined that universe's [[Sinister Six (Earth-177)|Sinister Six]], remains unclear.
