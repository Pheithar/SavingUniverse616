| History                 = Rico is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] student attending [[Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]]. He wants to become an astronaut.{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 1}}

He seems to be used to moving across the School using his powers to walk on the ceiling, and that almost causes a collision with [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], freshly returned from the dead at that time. He was warned by [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]] before Rico could run into him.{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 1}}

When the Trimegas assaulted the school, Rico bravely protected one of his fellow schoolmates by attacking the intruder, but was quickly overwhelmed, and as quickly saved by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]. He was teleported away by Nightcrawler and taken care of by [[Cecilia Reyes (Earth-616)|Cecilia Reyes]].{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 4}}

Rico explains to Nightcrawler that most nights he likes to explore the school because he doesn't need much sleep. He finds Kurt working on the [[X-Men Blackbird|Blackbird]] late at night and eventually Kurt asks if he'd like to join him on a test-flight, just for fun.{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 5}} The two get caught up with a favor for [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] and Rico has his very fist chance at being a hero by helping save a group of scared humans and a young mutant named [[Ziggy Karst (Earth-616)|Ziggy Karst]] from the [[Crimson Pirates (Earth-616)|Crimson Pirates]].{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 6}}

| Personality             = Rico was stated by [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]] to have a ''"wicked sense of humor"'',{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 1}} and by [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] to have ''"more courage than sense"''.{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 4}}

| Powers                  = Rico is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] mutated in the form of a winged-ant/scorpion, granting him at least the following abilities:
*'''Natural Weapons:''' Rico's mutant physiology has equipped him with two pincers and a stinger tail. The pincers are strong enough to crush small metal items,{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 6}} while the tail can be used as a clubbing weapon{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 12}} or additional limb with limited prehensibility.{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 6}} It is not yet known if his tail's stinger actually delivers venom, though by itself it can be used as an effective stabbling weapon if needed.
* '''Wallcrawling:''' Rico is able to walk on ceilings and roofs at high speeds.{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 1}}
* '''Flight:''' His wings, while apparently too small to carry his full weight, allow him to boost his jumps{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 4}} and his running speed.{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 12}}
*'''Enhanced Endurance:''' Rico's unusual physiology allows him to go on comparably less sleep than a normal human male of his age.{{r|Nightcrawler Vol 4 5}}
