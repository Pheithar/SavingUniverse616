===The First Morning Light===
[[File:Rise of Apocalypse Vol 1 3.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Rise of the First One]]
'''En Sabah Nur''' was born nearly five thousand years ago in a lone settlement on the Amentet at the very edge of the [[Valley of the Kings]], in [[Egypt]], as a member of a [[Clan Akkaba (Earth-616)|tribe]] in [[Akkaba (Egypt)|Akkaba]]. Even as an infant, the child inspired fear, being born with gray skin and blue lines running across his lips and face. Ugly and malformed, the infant was abandoned by the tribe, to die in the harsh desert sun. However, out of the desert, the Sandstormers, a roving band of feared nomadic raiders, slaughtered the citizens of Akkaba. Their leader, [[Baal (Sandstormers) (Earth-616)|Baal of the Crimson Sands]], found the infant crying and recognized the potential power in the child. Baal named the infant En Sabah Nur, literally meaning "The Morning Light", and raised him as his own son.{{r|Rise of Apocalypse #2}}

===Survival of the Fittest===
[[File:En Sabah Nur (Earth-616) and Sandstormers (Earth-616) from Rise of Apocalypse Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Nur's rite of passage]]
As Nur grew, he surpassed the other tribesmen in intelligence and strength. Everyone in the tribe, except for Baal, hated and feared Nur for his inhuman looks and great abilities. Nur did not understand their fear, but hardened his heart against it. Moreover, Nur believed in the principle that Baal and the tribe lived by, that only the fittest, toughest, most ruthless, and pitiless, tested by hardship, would and should survive. At this time Egypt was ruled by [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Pharaoh Rama-Tut]]. On the day of his tribal rite of passage into manhood, the seventeen-year-old Nur killed three armed warriors of the tribe using only his bare hands and Baal explained to him that Rama-Tut was no god, as most believed, but a man, who had arrived in a [[Time-Ship|Sphinx]]. Baal brought the young Nur to a sacred cave, whose entrance became blocked by a cave-in, trapping them underground.{{r|Rise of Apocalypse #1}} After a week of wandering without food or water, they found the remnants of Rama-Tut's time ship, within an underground Egyptian tomb. Baal told Nur that he believed him to be a conqueror, whose coming was foretold in ancient prophecies, and that Nur was destined to overthrow Rama-Tut. After Baal died from lack of nourishment, Nur, whose [[Homo superior|mutant]] physiology kept him alive, vowed to take vengeance on Rama-Tut and claim his destiny. Four weeks later, Nur finally made his way back to the surface and was found by Logo, the grand vizier of Rama-Tut, who gave him water and hid him as a slave. Nur was determined to kill both Rama-Tut and his warlord, [[Ozymandias (Earth-616)|Ozymandias]], for their part in Baal's death.{{r|Rise of Apocalypse #2}}

===Enslaved and Alone===
While a slave, Nur kept his disfigured lips constantly covered and [[Nephri (Earth-616)|Nephri]], sister of Ozymandias, became attracted to the mysterious slave.{{r|Rise of Apocalypse #2}} Eventually, Nur had a vision of the Egyptian death god, [[Seth (Earth-616)|Seth]], who urged him to become a conqueror and Nur was thrown into a pit of snakes, but survived when his superhuman powers activated. Nur grew in size and strength and was attacked by guards, but defeated them all, declaring himself Apocalypse.{{r|Rise of Apocalypse #3}}

===From Slave to Conqueror===
[[File:En Sabah Nur (Earth-616) from Rise of Apocalypse Vol 1 1 Cover.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The once and future king]]
At a time when many time-traveling super-heroes, including the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]], and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]], arrived in Rama-Tut's Egypt, the Pharaoh finally came face to face with Nur. In actuality, Rama-Tut was a time traveler from the far future, who would later become known as [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]]. Tut knew that '''[[Apocalypse]]''', one of the most powerful mutants who ever lived and the one who was destined to rule the world, had been born in ancient Egypt. Hence, Rama-Tut had gone back in time to find Apocalypse as a child, raise him, and thereby become the master of the most powerful being on the planet.{{R|Rise of Apocalypse #3}} Rama-Tut offered to make Nur his heir, if he would swear his loyalty. At that time, Nur revealed his face to Nephri, who rejected him for his appearance. Rama-Tut then tried to kill Nur, when he refused. Nur was then shot, by the Pharaoh, with the same weapon he used to de-power the Fantastic Four, and was again left to die, but survived with the sudden emergence of his mutant immortality and mass shifting. 

With his powers flaring, Tut fled as Nur defeated Ozymandias and his soldiers, Nur ran into the night to claim the Pharaoh's Sphinx and all its secrets. As morning came Ozymandias found Tut's lab within the Sphinx and a changed Nur, he attacked Ozymandias and throwing him into the technology, turned Ozymandias into a sand-like being, who could see the future almost right before it happened and would record Nur's accomplishments throughout time, as his scribe. While Nur unleashed his rage on the Pharaoh's technology, tut who had been fighting the Fantastic Four escaped back into the future, eventually to take on the identity of [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]]. The Fantastic Four went back to their [[Earth-616|era]], thinking the explosion a booby trap. Only one thing walked from the wreckage, only one thing survived, that is his nature, to conquer and crush. And with that he denounced the Pharaoh's people who wished to be his slave and to be protected by him, and went into the desert alone. Fifty years later, Nur revisited Nephri, now an ancient Egyptian Queen, and mocked her dying beauty, as he was still as he had been years before.{{r|Rise of Apocalypse #4}}{{r|X of Swords Handbook Vol 1 1}}

In 2620 B.C., Apocalypse joined forces with [[Imhotep (Earth-616)|Imhotep]]{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. #1}} and the [[Moon Knight (2620 BC) (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]] of [[Khonshu (Earth-616)|Khonshu]] (forming a protectorate who would become the [[Brotherhood of the Shield (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of the Shield]]){{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 9}} to successfully fend off a [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] invasion.{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. #1}} Other accounts stated Apocalypse only helped Imhotep against the Brood, but did not join the Brotherhood created afterwards.{{r|History of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1}}

===Celestial Contract===
At some point, using old hieroglyphs, Nur built his large Sphinx-shaped ship with alien materials, in part on his own as the ship also built itself, and began to hear a voice inside of his head. The voice belonged to the [[Celestials (Race)|Celestial]], [[Eson (Earth-616)|Eson the Searcher]], who spoke through [[Telepathy|telepathy]] and called Nur "Apocalypse". Eson presented Nur with the proposition to use the technology on the ship to become a feared, great powerful creature, to shape the destiny of the world, or simply leave and never remember anything. Nur accepted and Eson stated that one day, maybe in centuries or millennia, the Celestials would come for payments for their gifts.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 186}}

From then on, Nur plotted the conquest of the planet, through bringing about wars and conflict, in which the strong would defeat and destroy the weak. 

===Clan Akkaba & Dark Riders===
[[File:En Sabah Nur (Earth-616) from X-Men Apocalypse vs. Dracula Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Nur with his Riders of the Dark]]
When Apocalypse fully realized his power and defeated the Pharaoh and his army, Egypt entered a new age, one in which his children walked among them. Offspring of Nur received a portion of his power, those closest related having near identical abilities. Nur forged his clan, now called [[Clan Akkaba (Earth-616)|Clan Akkaba]] after his birthplace and those who had abandoned and left him to die. During this time, the site of Akkaba reached somewhat of a renaissance as great monuments were erected there, whether by Nur, his descendants, or by the new Pharaoh no one knew. Egypt peaked, and so too did the clan’s influence on the world. With attacks by Alexander the Great and his Persian armies, Nur and his kin fought valiantly in a battle he would never forget. This battle helped Nur winnow out the weak in his clan and, as Egypt became nothing but a distant memory to the clan’s influence, Nur moved on to [[Ancient Rome]].{{r|Cable #18}}{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #457}}

Over the ages Apocalypse also had often banded together the best human warriors from around the world to serve in his army of foot soldiers known as the [[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Riders of the Dark]]. His group of fanatics devoted to the Darwinian ideals that the strong ("fit") should inherit the Earth and the weak ("unfit") should be culled, weeded them out.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #3}}

Over the centuries, Nur was worshiped by many civilizations, under a variety of names.{{r|X-Factor #24}}

===Okkara & Family Lost===
[[File:Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616) from Marvel Comics Vol 1 1000.jpg|thumb|right|Apocalypse and his First Horsemen.]]
At an uncertain point in the distant past, Apocalypse found and began living on the sentient island of [[Okkara (Earth-616)|Okkara]]. There, among the mutant population he founded it's society. While on Okkara, he met and married [[Genesis (Earth-616)|Genesis]], they had four children together, two sons and two daughters who eventually became their [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|First Horsemen]]. When the island was split by a force wielding the [[Twilight Sword (Amenth)|Twilight Sword]], the mutants led by Apocalypse and his family fought the invading [[Daemons]] spilling forth from the hellish reality of [[Amenth]]. During the war, the living god of the Daemons, [[Annihilation (Earth-616)|Annihilation]], offered peace to the mutants, in terms spoken only to Genesis. The terms were refused, but it eventually became clear that the mutants would inevitably lose. In order to buy Earth time, a plan was concocted to seal off the half of Okkara gripped by the daemons, along with Genesis, the Horsemen and the remaining mutants of Okkara, who would hold off the Amenthi hordes. Apocalypse was left behind, as he was deemed too weak to cross over.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 12}}{{r|Powers of X #4}} Before Genesis left for Amenth, she had Apocalypse promise to use the time they would buy him to shepherd mutantkind, to judge them, and to ensure that only the strongest survived, so that they would be prepared for when the Daemons inevitably returned.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 13}}{{r|X of Swords Handbook Vol 1 1}}

By 281, Apocalypse was already recruiting for his "Final Horsemen", collecting [[Decimus Furius (Earth-616)|Decimus Furius]] and storing him away to awaken later. In 325, he recruited [[Sanjar Javeed (Earth-616)|Sanjar Javeed]] for the same purpose.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #3}}

===11th Century===
In 1013, Apocalypse came to [[Scandinavia]] to kill on the counsel of [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Rama-Tut]] who informed him of beings and ancestors of people who would cause a threat to him in the future. After defeating Thor he went to [[London (England)|London]] and sent his four [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Four Horsemen]] ([[Phantom Bats of the Twelve Minds (Earth-616)|Pestilence/Phantom Bats of the Twelve Minds]], [[War (11th Century) (Earth-616)|War]], Native-American [[Famine (11th Century) (Earth-616)|Famine]], and [[Death (11th Century) (Earth-616)|Death]]) to kill [[Folkbern Logan (Earth-616)|Folkbern Logan]], ancestor of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], but they were all destroyed by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]. [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] faced off with En Sabah Nur. He was defeated. Seeking revenge, Thor blessed [[Jarnbjorn]] with his own blood to imbue it with the power to pierce Celestial armor.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #6}}

After being convinced by [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] that the false gods mocked him needed to perish, Apocalypse came into conflict again with Thor, but this time the god of thunder was accompanied by his team of [[Avengers (1,000 AD) (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 38}}

===Forever Walker===
In the mid 12th century Ho-Lo Shan Mountains of Northern [[Mongolia]], Nur heard of a ruler, who was powered by an immense [[glossary:A#Alien|alien]] [[Prosh (Earth-616)|Ship]] which crashed, and sought him out as another immortal. In a confrontation, Nur slew all of [[Garbha-Hsien (Earth-616)|Garbha-Hsien]]'s guards. Garbha-Hsien then sought to humble his fellow 'forever-walker', by revealing the secret titanic vessel. Having had previous experience with futuristic technology, Nur attacked Garbha-Hsien and left the other immortal for dead. Not understanding how to kill an immortal, Garbha-Hsien survived and fled. After striking down Garbha-Hsien, Nur entered the Ship and lived on it for many years, not fully understanding how to communicate with it or control it. Shortly after finding the Ship, Nur and his Riders of the Dark were constantly attacked by a young warrior with a sword and shield calling himself the [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Traveler]].{{r|X-Force 37}}{{r|Cable & Deadpool #26}}{{r|X of Swords Handbook Vol 1 1}}

===The Traveler & the Celestial Ship===
[[File:Ozymandias (Earth-616) and En Sabah Nur (Earth-616) from Incredible Hulk Vol 1 457 0001.png|left|thumb|230px|En Sabah Nur & Ozymandias]]
After years of sending assassins and battling the Traveler, Nur severed Traveler's left cybernetic arm and, during the confusion, the Traveler pulled a gun and shot him in the head. After reattaching his techno-organic arm, Traveler was accepted as the new leader of the Riders of the Dark, but declined. Traveler turned to Ozymandias and instructed him to remember that there will always be someone smarter and stronger around and that being fit to survive means to have the responsibility to help those who are not. Unaware to the Traveler, his techno-organic infected blood mixed with Nur's, as he wiped Nur's blood on Ozymandias. Ozymandias had Nur's dead body brought to the alien Ship, hoping that its technology could heal him, and Traveler arrived, to ambush a caravan of advanced technology. Traveler explained to Ozymandias that the Ship was actually a Celestial transport for a highly advanced alien race, a sentient exploratory device, and entered the ship. Inside, Traveler learned that his blood, mixed with the [[Techno-Organic Virus]], and Nur's resurrected Nur and, infected with the virus, allowed Nur to understand Ship. Nur was transformed and enhanced by Celestial technology, becoming one of the most powerful beings who would ever live, now possessing the ability of total control over the molecular structure of his body. Angry at the revelation, Traveler told Nur that if he was responsible for his immortality, he would make Nur spend eternity far away from there and sent both Ship and its passenger far into space. Over the next few centuries, Ship's sentience slowly evolved and Nur noticed, but enslaved it, telling Ship that he had created it. After gaining so much power, Nur also began to take long slumbers in Ship and to refuel his powers.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #26|27}}

===Exodus===
During the Third Crusades in the 12th century, the crusader [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Bennet du Paris]] sought out the legendary Tower of Power, the domain of the mythic "Eternal Pharaoh" in Akkaba. After traveling for hours through violent sandstorms, Paris finally collapsed and a voice spoke to him, asking if he was willing to risk everything to become one of the strong. Paris was then tested and his mutant powers manifested for the first time. Proving himself strong, Paris disappeared from the spot. Nur had teleported Paris onto his Ship and transformed him into Exodus. After capturing the time-traveling [[Sersi (Earth-616)|Sersi]] and the [[Black Knight]], [[Eobar Garrington (Earth-616)|Eobar Garrington]], who was being controlled by the time-traveling Black Knight, [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Dane Whitman]], Nur commanded Exodus to destroy the Black Knight. Exodus refused and turned on Nur, calling him a "false god". However, Exodus was no match for Nur and Nur stripped Exodus of his power. He sealed him away in a crypt in the [[Swiss Alps]], trapped in a coma like state with a curse preventing Exodus from leaving, yet others were allowed to come and go as they pleased.{{r|Black Knight: Exodus #1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: X-Men 2005 Vol 1 1}}

===15th Century ===
Sometime during the fifteenth century, Nur had his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Four Horsemen of Apocalypse]], [[Pestilence]], [[Famine]], [[War]], and [[Death]], and rode among them as well, leading an army of Riders of the Dark. This army was so strong and powerful that some were led to believe that they were just a myth, to scare soldiers before their first battle.

In 1459, in [[Romania]], the Horsemen of War led the Riders of the Dark and, single-handedly, defeated [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Vlad the Impaler]] and his army. Nur personally bested Vlad in single combat, an event which led to Vlad becoming the immortal [[Vampires|vampire]], Dracula.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}

===Mister Sinister===
Nur was later seen in 1859, Victorian [[England]], after being awoken from centuries of hibernation in an underground chamber by the Marauders, and ordered them to take him to their leader, [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Dr. Nathaniel Essex]]. Nur offered to transform Essex into a long-lived superhuman being himself, to give him the time to further his research, but at a cost: his servitude. Left with the choice of continuing his work or his [[Rebecca Essex (Earth-616)|wife]] shunning him, Dr. Essex allied himself with Nur. Dr. Essex explained to Nur that he was the first born in, what Dr. Essex believed, would be a great mutation in the human race. After taking Nur to the [[Hellfire Club Building (London)|Hellfire Club]], Nur demonstrated his power before the men and explained that Dr. Essex's theories of mutation were more near than he believed. After defeating the time-travelers [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Phoenix]], Nur left them to Dr. Essex, as test subjects.{{r|Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #1}} After the death of his wife and her shunning him, Dr. Essex agreed to Nur's offer and was ordered to create a plague to destroy the weak of the world, as Nur's first prelate, Pestilence. Apocalypse painfully transformed Dr. Essex into an ageless being of extraordinary pallor with [[Telekinesis|telekinesis]] in his alien Ship, asking him to shed his past name and choose another. With his new abilities and dispassionate outlook, Dr. Essex took the new name, "Sinister", [[Rebecca Essex (Earth-616)|Rebecca Essex]]'s last words to him.{{r|Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #2}}

Nur had plans to assassinate Britain's Queen and Prime Minister, and almost succeeded, but was defeated by the time-traveling X-Men who began to shift back to their own time. Returning to Nur's Ship, Nur demanded to know why the plague was not complete and Mr. Sinister stated that he manipulated the plague, so that it would affect only Nur himself, but his immune system quickly adapted to it.{{r|Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #3}} Nur asked why and Mr. Sinister replied that cruelty for no purpose was ignorance and ignorance was the greatest enemy of science. As Nur began to return to his hibernation, he stated that Sinister's defiance was a sign of his strength, but it would not be tolerated again. Nur warned Sinister to never forget who had the true power and, when he returned, it would be the dawn of the Age of Apocalypse and Sinister would be his servant.{{r|Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #4}}

===Dracula===
[[File:En Sabah Nur (Earth-616) from X-Men Apocalypse vs. Dracula Vol 1 1 0002.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Apocalypse awakened to battle Vlad once again]]
In 1897, Dracula, now an immortal vampire warlord, discovered the existence of Clan Akkaba and its relation to En Sabah Nur. Dracula then began a vengeful campaign against Clan Akkaba, slaughtering many before [[Abraham van Helsing (Earth-616)|Abraham van Helsing]] determined he was involved. When the clan's leader, [[Hamilton Slade (Vampire) (Earth-616)|Hamilton Slade]], disappeared, they were left with no choice but to summon their lord.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}} The clan awoke Apocalypse, in order to deal with the threat of Dracula. Unknown to the members of the clan, Dracula was turning members of Clan Akkaba into vampires in order to battle Apocalypse as revenge for his earlier defeat and the way the Dark Lord had previously shamed him.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #2}}

[[File:X-Men Apocalypse vs. Dracula Vol 1 4 Textless.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Apocalypse's defeat of Dracula]]

Apocalypse, as punishment for being so weak in requesting a boon from him, killed one of the clan's leaders. After meeting and initially being mistaken as a vampire by van Helsing, Apocalypse joined him, [[Jack Starsmore (Earth-616)|Jack Starsmore]], [[Frederick Slade (Earth-616)|Frederick Slade]], and Ozymandias to combat Dracula and the undead members of Clan Akkaba.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #3}} Apocalypse and his group were at first overwhelmed by the vampires, but eventually emerged victorious, thanks to Frederick and Jack. Dracula was impaled with his own limbs and decapitated by Apocalypse. Apocalypse refused to follow van Helsing's "superstitious" rituals to permanently destroy the vampire, leaving the body. He then went back into hibernation.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #4}}

Back in 1899 in England, Sinister helped awaken Apocalypse from his slumber. Apocalypse thanked him for his servitude over the years and said that out of all the servants, Sinister was the most loyal. Sinister secretly bided his time for the right moment to stop Apocalypse himself. He decided this was not the time and said that he lived only to serve Apocalypse. Apocalypse even offered him a normal life again and Sinister said that his life was his science. He then went back into hibernation.{{r|Cable Annual #1999}}

===Birth of Cable===
Feeling threatened by the power of Nur, Sinister conducted numerous experiments in his time, searching for a powerful mutant to oppose his master. Sinister eventually realized [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Scott Summers]] and [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]]'s mingled genes would create a mutant of unparalleled power, to destroy Apocalypse and thus free him from the yoke of that ancient tyrant. Sinister hoped he could control such a mutant and use it to defeat Apocalypse. At the time, Jean was believed to be acting reckless, so Sinister created a clone of her and named the clone [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]], creating a false background for her and placing her into the world after [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|"Jean's"]] apparent death. Sinister's plan, then, was to produce a child from the union of Madelyne and Scott, whom he believed would become a genetically superior mutant. The infant, [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Nathan Christopher Charles Summers]], was so powerful that, upon his birth, he woke Apocalypse from his hibernation.{{Citation}}

===Alliance of Evil===
Emerging from his Celestial Ship in a new world, Apocalypse realized that mutants had begun to populate the Earth and began his plan of domination. Out-fitting himself with armor from Ship, Apocalypse began to form the [[Alliance of Evil (Earth-616)|Alliance of Evil]], a team of mutants which he employed, and set up technologically advanced safe houses all over the world. Apocalypse also blackmailed the mutant [[Michael Nowlan (Earth-616)|Michael Nowlan]] and designed a machine to feed Nowlan's addiction, as well as to reverse it as needed to utilize his power.{{r|X-Factor #5}} Apocalypse used Nowlan's power to enhance the abilities of the other members of the Alliance of Evil. Around this time, the [[Registration Acts|Mutant Registration Act]] was passed, which called for all mutants to register with the government, forfeiting their civil rights and criminalizing an unregistered mutant.{{r|X-Factor #6}}{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #17}}

The Alliance of Evil was first seen when [[Edward Pasternak (Earth-616)|Tower]] was hired to kidnap [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] member [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] for the geneticist [[Carl Maddicks (Earth-616)|Dr. Carl Maddicks]]. Later, Apocalypse sent [[Joanna Cargill (Earth-616)|Frenzy]] to capture the young mutant [[Russell Collins (Earth-616)|Rusty Collins]], but she was stopped by X-Factor.{{r|X-Factor #10}} Nowlan eventually escaped from Apocalypse and Apocalypse sent the Alliance after him. After revealing himself as the leader of the Alliance of Evil, X-Factor battled him and his team. After Nowlan's death, the Alliance was defeated and presumably imprisoned and Apocalypse abandoned them, believing them weak.{{r|X-Factor #11|12}}{{r|X-Factor #14}}

===New Horseman===
[[File:X-Factor Vol 1 19.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Horsemen of Apocalypse's first modern incarnation]]
Subsequently, Apocalypse began recruiting his newest Horsemen and taking them aboard his Ship, which floated cloaked above [[New York City|New York]]. The first modern Horseman recruited by Apocalypse was [[Plague (Earth-616)|Plague]], a member of the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]], whom he rescued and recruited during the [[Mutant Massacre]] of Sinister's [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]], to fill the role of [[Pestilence]]. Apocalypse then approached ex-soldier [[Abraham Kieros (Earth-616)|Abraham Kieros]], in an iron lung barely able to speak, and granted him the position of War. [[Autumn Rolfson (Earth-616)|Autumn Rolfson]] was Apocalypse's third choice, who he appeared to in her room after an argument with her parents, and was given the position of Famine. Apocalypse then saved the de-winged [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] from his sabotaged, exploding plane and chose him to be his fourth and final Horseman, Death.{{r|X-Factor #15}}{{r|X-Factor #17}} Apocalypse granted Kieros the use of his legs and restored his health.{{r|X-Factor #18}} Apocalypse also grafted new, techno-organic wings onto Angel's back, which could fly higher, faster, were razor sharp, possessed blades that could be thrown laced with a neurotoxin, and could even fold into a barely visible bundle on his back for concealing.{{r|X-Factor #19}}

To test his new Horsemen, Apocalypse sent them to battle X-Factor, in New York's [[Central Park]], but they were all defeated by [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]]. After the fourth Horseman, Death, was revealed to be Warren, Apocalypse had the Horsemen battle each other, to find the leader, and Death beat them all.{{r|X-Factor #21}} To test his newest leader's abilities, Apocalypse teleported X-Factor on-board his Ship and, as Death, Warren fought the rest of X-Factor and captured them. However, Apocalypse offered X-Factor to join him and [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]], noticing Warren's improvement and wishing to exact revenge on the Marauders, asked Apocalypse to grant him enough superhuman power to wreak vengeance on his enemies and Apocalypse accepted.{{r|X-Factor #22}} When Cyclops asked for Caliban to rescue X-Factor, Caliban simply apologized and agreed to become Apocalypse's Hellhound. After X-Factor's defeat, the Horsemen were sent into [[Manhattan]], to incite chaos. X-Factor and the [[Power Pack (Earth-616)|Power Pack]] battled the Horsemen.{{r|X-Factor #23}} In the battle, Pestilence was killed, Famine was sent to [[United States of America|America]]'s Bread Basket, and Apocalypse called Death and War back to Ship, where Warren was soon brought out of his brainwashing, after Iceman faked his own death at Warren's hands by having him destroy an ice sculpture of [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Bobby Drake]].{{r|X-Factor #24}} Warren rejoined his former team and, after their defeat of Apocalypse, his Ship crash landed on their [[X-Factor Complex|Complex]] and X-Factor began living on Apocalypse's sentient Ship, while Caliban left with Apocalypse.{{r|{{cl|X-Factor #25}}-[[X-Factor #27|27]]}} While sleeping, X-Factor and their students were attacked by Ship, still under the control of Apocalypse, but Rusty freed its consciousness. Recognizing X-Factor's leader, Cyclops, as the same that defeated him centuries ago, Apocalypse believed X-Factor worthy adversaries and allowed them to live on Ship.{{r|X-Factor #28}}

===The Evolutionary War===
While operating under Apocalypse, Caliban sensed the mental anguish of the mutant [[Moloids|Moloid]], [[Val-Or (Earth-616)|Val-Or]], and informed his master, alerting Apocalypse to the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]]'s plans. After an initial battle, Apocalypse realized that the High Evolutionary was a man after his own heart, even if the High Evolutionary did not want to believe it, and left him to weed-out the weak of the species.{{r|X-Factor Annual Vol 1 3}}

===Inhumans===
Apocalypse used advanced genetic engineering methods to increase Caliban's size and strength and renamed him "Hellhound", while he joined Apocalypse's Horsemen. Wishing to prove himself worthy of the title Death, Caliban, on his own, attempted to kill Warren, but was defeated and berated by Apocalypse, upon his return. At some point, Apocalypse contacted members of the [[Inhumans (Race)|Inhumans]], on the [[Blue Area of the Moon|Blue Area of the]] [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]], and persuaded them to join his ideological view and form a new team of [[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Riders of the Storm]] under his guidance, while building a base on the Moon.{{r|X-Factor Annual #3}}

===Savage Land & Acts of Vengeance===
Apocalypse attempted to destroy the [[Savage Land]] but was stopped by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]].{{r|Wolverine: The Jungle Adventure #1}}

[[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] went to Apocalypse to offer him a major part in his [[Acts of Vengeance (Event)|Acts of Vengeance]] Conspiracy against the Avengers. Apocalypse refused to join him, having other ideas in mind for humanity. Loki attempted to slay the eternal mutant but Apocalypse shielded them from the blast. With the battle over, Apocalypse told Caliban that it was time to begin the next phase of his test of survival on humanity.{{r|X-Factor #50}}

===Nathan Summers===
Realizing that young Nathan was the same Traveller that defeated him centuries ago, Apocalypse ordered the Riders of the Storm to kidnap Nathan and take him to his base on the Blue Area of the Moon, where Apocalypse infected the infant with the Techno-Organic Virus, both to start a time paradox that ensured his own creation and recognizing the potential threat and usefulness (capable of housing his essence) of the boy's power.{{r|X-Factor #65}} Apocalypse also ordered the Riders of the Storm to infect Ship with the Techno-Organic Virus, that damaged its systems and caused Ship to attack New York. Explosion imminent, Ship launched itself into space to protect the city, but the Ship A.I. managed to salvage itself as an energy construct.{{r|X-Factor #66}} With the help of the Inhumans and his fellow teammates, Cyclops saved his son, through the combined strength of Nathan, Jean, and himself. [[Jen Askani (Earth-4935)|Sister Askani]] presented herself, from the [[Earth-4935|late 37th century]], 100 years after [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-4935)|Apocalypse]] conquered the world, and stated her mission to save the child.{{r|X-Factor #67}} Choosing to save his son's life and believing that he would never see him again, Cyclops reluctantly allowed Askani to take Nathan forward to her time, to cure the virus. Askani did so at the cost of her life.{{r|X-Factor #68}}

Apocalypse later battled the [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]].{{r|Sensational She-Hulk #30}}

===Future Son Stryfe===
While hibernating in Bani Maza, Egypt, Apocalypse was awakened by a man in armor, calling himself [[Nathaniel Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]] and claiming to repay Apocalypse for his abusive parenting.{{r|X-Force #17}} With his Dark Riders of the Storm watching, Apocalypse, who had never met Stryfe at this point and was still weak from waking too early, was defeated by Stryfe, who stabbed him with a sword that he claimed Apocalypse used to kill him at one point.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 14}} While attempting to heal, Apocalypse fled to one of his safehouses, where he was attacked by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] believing that he was behind the kidnapping of Scott and Jean. While battling the X-Men, Apocalypse learned that someone had been committing acts in his name. Eager to learn more about current events, Apocalypse broke in to one of [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]]'s safehouses and learned that Stryfe had taken control of his Riders of the Storm, calling them the Dark Riders. Sinister meanwhile had impersonated him, taking control of the Horsemen and kidnapping Cyclops and Jean.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 15}}{{r|X-Factor #85}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #295}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #296}}

Stryfe had also posed as Cable himself and publicly made an assassination attempt on [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]], founder of the X-Men. Stryfe's bullet had infected Professor Xavier with the then incurable Techno-Organic Virus.{{r|X-Force #18}} While Beast and [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]], via video conference, worked diligently to cure Prof. Xavier of the Techno-Organic Virus ravaging his body, Apocalypse stepped-in and provided the cure. The X-Men initially did not want Apocalypse's aid, but Warren, surprisingly, vouched for Apocalypse's genius. When Apocalypse asked why, Warren stated that he would kill Apocalypse after torturing him and at a time of his choosing.{{r|X-Factor #86}}

After deducing that Stryfe was on Apocalypse's old Moon base, Apocalypse accompanied a small group of X-Men, [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]], and [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] to battle Stryfe and his Dark Riders. Apocalypse split from the group, single-handily battling the Dark Riders and, after the battle, was greatly injured. When Warren was informed that Apocalypse was dying, he left the final battle to find him and decided to leave him to die alone, when Apocalypse asked him to end his misery.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 16}}{{r|Cable #19}}

===Mimeyoshi & Age of Apocalypse===
[[Mimeyoshi (Earth-616)|Mimeyoshi]] was created by En Sabah Nur to serve as an assassin and was sent against Namor.{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner Annual #3}}

[[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]] went back into the past to kill [[Erik Lehnsherr (Earth-295)|Magneto]] but [[Charles Xavier (Earth-295)|Xavier]] died instead, which created the alternate timeline [[Age of Apocalypse]]. [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-295)|Apocalypse]] of the past awoke early and began a war to conquer the world and remake it in his image.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 41}}

===Onslaught===
Apocalypse was awakened from his healing slumber by Ozymandias to learn about the new threat to Earth, [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #335}} He watched the creature battle Earth heroes.{{r|Onslaught Marvel Universe #1}} [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu the Watcher]] suggested Apocalypse make an alliance with Cable.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #335}} Apocalypse believed he would be vulnerable through the [[Astral Plane]], and needed Cable's help to reach the realm. He freed the captive [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]], greatly weakening Onslaught. The plan worked but was interrupted by the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]], who had invisibly come with them, having suspected Apocalypse's motive in wanting to actually killing Franklin. However this gave Onslaught the time to escape, prolonging the fight.{{r|Cable #34|35}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #335|336}}{{r|Fantastic Four #415}}

===Hulk: The Horseman of War===
The [[Hulk]] and [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] were split into two separate beings by Onslaught. Hulk now drew upon energy derived from Franklin's [[Heroes Reborn (1996 Event)|pocket universe]]. Apocalypse recruited the Hulk to become his Horseman, War, to defeat the [[Celestials]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #455}} He sent the Hulk against the [[New World Order (Earth-616)|New World Order]]. The New World Order in turn set the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] and [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]] against him. The Hulk defeated them both. Hulk soon came to his senses after injuring [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #456}} This was still a win for Apocalypse as it allowed him to test his new device. He activated the self-destruct mechanism on the Sword of War destroying their headquarters.{{r|Incredible Hulk #457}}

===Harbinger of Apocalypse===
The [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] later awoke Apocalypse's long-hidden [[Harbinger of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Harbinger of Apocalypse]] from hibernation, originally a normal man, whom Apocalypse in the 19th century once left to incubate for 100 years.{{r|Cable #53}} Apocalypse released Caliban and Ozymandias from his possession, to fend for themselves if they were to survive the coming events.{{r|Cable #64}} Cable with the Avengers battled the Harbinger, but were unable to stop him. Apocalypse then appeared and activated a bomb inside the Harbinger which would destroy all of [[New York City]], but Cable managed to stop it.{{r|Cable #66|68}}

===Magneto, Deviants & Eternals===
When [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] disrupted the Earth's magnetic field, Apocalypse sent a [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrull]] impersonating the mutant [[Astra (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Astra]] to stop him.{{r|Magneto Rex #3}}

Apocalypse planned to test the [[Deviants]] and set off a nuclear bomb in the underground city of [[Lemuria (Deviant)|Lemuria]], causing them to further mutate. Apocalypse then attacked [[San Francisco]], using the now gigantic [[Karkas (Earth-616)|Karkas]]. The [[Eternals]] were forced to battle the creature. Apocalypse was confronted by [[Ikaris (Earth-616)|Ikaris]], who became a [[Prime Eternal]]. Although Apocalypse defeated Ikaris, he still succeeded in thwarting his plans.{{r|New Eternals: Apocalypse Now #1}}

===The Twelve===
To secure a new host body, Apocalypse sought to siphon the awesome energies of '''[[Apocalypse: The Twelve|The Twelve]]''', mutants of incredible power that were destined to alter the course of history. This time it was [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] who fell into the warlord's grasp. The feral X-Man fought his teammates ferociously as the [[Four Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horseman]] [[Death]], but broke free from Apocalypse's control.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #376}}

However, Wolverine and his fellow Horsemen had served their purpose. Taking advantage of the distraction afforded by their actions, Apocalypse collected the mutants he required to carry out his plan: [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Phoenix]], [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]], [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]], the [[Ahmet Abdol (Earth-616)|Living Monolith]], [[Mikhail Rasputin (Earth-616)|Mikhail Rasputin]], [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]], [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], and [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]].{{r|Cable #74|75}}{{r|X-Man #59}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 96}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 145|147}}

The Twelve's energy would be siphoned into the Monolith and then from him into X-Man, a time-tossed teenager possessed of vast telepathic and telekinetic power. As the power went into him Nur would possess the boy. As his teammates fell around him, a powerless Cyclops shoved X-Man out of the [http://xmenrebirth.wikia.com/wiki/Celestial_Circuit draining circuit], merging with Apocalypse to create a new evil entity.{{r|X-Man #59|60}} But the telepathic Phoenix, Summers' wife Jean Grey, detected her husband's psyche inside the composite being and prevented the X-Men from destroying it.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #377|378}} Cyclops was presumed dead by most of his teammates; only Cable and Jean refused to believe he had perished.{{r|Cable #76}}

===Cyclops & Decimation===
An amnesiac and powerless cyborg Cyclops gained control of the merged form, but Apocalypse began to re-emerge.{{r|X-Men: The Search for Cyclops #1}} Jean and Cable were alerted to his location in Egypt, where Jean in the end managed to free Cyclops by telepathically tearing out Apocalypse's essence from her husband's body.{{r|X-Men: The Search for Cyclops #2|3}} This trapped Apocalypse in an incorporeal astral form, which Cable seemingly destroyed using his [[Psimitar]].{{r|X-Men: The Search for Cyclops #4}}

[[File:X-Men Vol 2 182 Textless.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Apocalypse reborn]]
However, after the event known as [[Decimation|M-Day]], Apocalypse was resurrected using the techno-organic virus.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #26}} As he had once been awakened to a world brimming with mutant potential, Apocalypse was now awakened to a world that had lost 90% of its mutants. This changed Apocalypse's outlook somewhat, and he declared himself the savior of mutantkind.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #27}}

Apocalypse began assembling his new Horsemen. He kidnapped [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] and the [[Leper Queen (Earth-616)|Leper Queen]] to make one of them [[Pestilence]]. He found the Leper Queen too eager for the position, and instead chose the recently de-powered Polaris. He brought [[Gazer (Earth-616)|Gazer]] back to Earth and forced him to fight an archaeologist who had discovered his tomb for the position of [[War]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 179}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 182}} After Gazer's victory (with the assistance of Ozymandias), Apocalypse approached the newly-legless [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]], offering to restore him in return for becoming his Horseman of [[Famine]]. Apocalypse then sent his Horseman [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)#Pestilence|Pestilence]] to a military installation to ingest every disease known to man.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 183}}

With three Horsemen, Apocalypse went to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]], where he proclaimed himself the savior of mutantkind, and offered the X-Men and [[198 (Earth-616)|198]] mutants seeking shelter his leadership.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 184}} Many mutants, such as [[Maximus Jensen (Earth-616)|Mammomax]], [[Sally Blevins (Earth-616)|Skids]], [[Peter Quinn (Earth-616)|Peeper]], [[Philippa Sontag (Earth-616)|Arclight]], and [[John Greycrow (Earth-616)|Scalphunter]], accepted this offer, even though in the case of some it was to counter the effects of Famine, who was using his hunger-inducing powers to force everyone present to accept the blood of Apocalypse. The X-Men, however, went after Famine, who [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] recognized. While War fought against the only manned [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] left after Famine's starving effect, Apocalypse made his final Horseman, [[Death]], from the X-Man [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 185}}

Apocalypse's plan was to decimate the human population as well, reducing them to 10% of their current population, so that they and mutantkind might once again be on an even playing field. He was defeated by the X-Men with assistance from [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E (Earth-616)|Sentinel Squad O*N*E]], the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], and Ozymandias's betrayal.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 186}} Apocalypse threw himself into the maw of the Sphinx, sending him spiraling into unknown space. As Apocalypse began to die, he was contacted once more by the [[Celestials (Race)|Celestials]]. The day of reckoning was upon him, as they saved Apocalypse from death, and took him away, to recollect the debt he had promised them in his youth.{{r|Eternals Vol 4 4}}

===The Final Horsemen===
[[File:En Sabah Nur (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 1 0001.png|right|150px|thumb|Young En Sabah Nur]]
Ozymandias and Clan Akkaba once again resurrected Apocalypse, but this time in the form of a child.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #1}} In this form, Apocalypse seemed to have no memory of his past or his previous disregard for life.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #3}} Ozymandias and the Celestial Ship took to tutoring and indoctrinating the child Apocalypse.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #1}} To protect this young En Sabah Nur, [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|The Final Horsemen]], mutants collected over the centuries, were activated.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #2}} [[Decimus Furius (Earth-616)|War]], [[Ichisumi (Earth-616)|Pestilence]], [[Jeb Lee (Earth-616)|Famine]], and [[Sanjar Javeed (Earth-616)|Death]] battled [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] and nearly defeated them.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #3}} However, due largely to [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]]'s illusions, the team disposed of the Horsemen and killed Ozymandias. When they discovered the young Apocalypse, the team fought over what to do with him. The issue was rendered moot when Fantomex shot the boy in the head leading to one of his Horsemen of Death, Archangel, taking his place as the instrument of the Celestials.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #4}}

Apocalypse was cloned and raised by Fantomex as a hero, named [[Evan Sabahnur (Earth-616)|Evan Sabahnur]]. He tried his best to defeat Archangel, providing the opportunity for Psylocke to attack him with the Seed of Life. After the battle, Fantomex decided to send Evan to [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #7}}

===Degeneration===
En Sabah Nur later returned in secret; however, although his consciousness had evolved to immortality, like all his hosts, his body was once again degenerating. To rectify this situation, Apocalypse traveled to a small island off the coast of [[South America]] and began modifying [[Finch (Item)|the Finch]], a piece of Celestial technology designed to repair genetic degradation, to transform the cells of future host bodies into perfect vessels as immortal as his mind. Unfortunately his fourth test subject, [[D'oerek (Earth-616)|D'oerek]], feared death and resisted the transformation, his strength of will causing feedback that overloaded the Finch resulting in an explosion. When En Sabah Nur awoke, he found himself in a seemingly strange and primitive world, his powers failing him as his current host body's degradation rapidly increased.{{r|X-Men: Black - Magneto Vol 1 1}}

Apocalypse then grappled with his own mortality, devolving into a human-like state while fighting off threats from creatures and finding himself further weakened by pathogens in the water as his healing factor failed and he struggled to find a place where he might repair the Finch and restore his host body long enough to return to his work of creating the perfect vessel.{{r|X-Men: Black - Mojo Vol 1 1}} Devolving further into a caveman-like state, En Sabah Nur fought to protect what remained of the Finch from actual cavemen, his mind fuzzy and his body battered and broken before the very test subjects he had been experimenting on before suddenly arrived.{{r|X-Men: Black - Mystique Vol 1 1}}

Unfortunately they had not come for Apocalypse at all, in fact the did not even recognize him, instead they had come to capture cavemen to use as test subjects of their own. Repairing the Finch, they began to continue En Sabah Nur's former work, attempting to modify the cavemen to serve as hosts for themselves when their own bodies would eventually fail. When it came time for Apocalypse to be the next caveman test subject, he grabbed hold of D'oerek as the energy of the Finch washed over them both, allowing his mind to transfer into his intended vessel, leaving the one that had been devolving to die on the exam table.{{r|X-Men: Black - Juggernaut Vol 1 1}}

His immortal mind now bestowed upon an immortal host body, it was only then that En Sabah Nur realized he had not been transported to another planet, rather the earlier explosion from the Finch had simply evolved his entire South American island, infusing his superior genetics into everything the blast wave struck, transforming it into the tribulation which he had been forced to endure. Apocalypse then gave his perfect host body a trial run as he killed the remaining test subjects, who were upset about their leader D'oerek's death at his master's hand, while reducing the entire island to rubble that was reclaimed by the sea.{{r|X-Men: Black - Emma Frost Vol 1 1}}

===X-Men Disassembled & the [[Age of X-Man]]===
When X-Man returned from seclusion with his powers fully restored using a [[Life Seed]], he kidnapped Apocalypse and kept him chained up while he planned to change the world into a utopia for mutants. X-Man's attempts to change the world were challenged by the X-Men. When X-Man realized that he couldn't change the world with the X-Men around, X-Man chose to wipe them out in an instant. Apocalypse was seemingly wiped out as well.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 1|10}}

Apocalypse and the X-Men were transported to a [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|different reality]] created by X-Man using a Life Seed where he attempted to create a utopia for mutants. He erased the memories of those he brought there, including Apocalypse, so they didn't resist.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}

Apocalypse became the founder of the [[X-Tracts (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|X-Tracts]], a group of mutants he brought together who believed that the way of [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]] and the [[X-Men (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|X-Men]]'s world beliefs were different than their own.{{r|Age of X-Man: Apocalypse & the X-Tracts Vol 1 1}}

When X-Man was made to realize that forcing his beliefs on others was wrong, he allowed those he trapped in his reality to go free and return to the real world, including Apocalypse.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

===[[Dawn of X]]===
Six months later, [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] sent out a telepathic message to everyone on Earth, declaring the foundation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], a new mutant nation.{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}} Xavier sent out another telepathic call to all mutants, offering amnesty and a place on Krakoa.{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 5}} Two days after Krakoa was officially recognized by the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]], Apocalypse traveled to Krakoa alongside many other former enemies of the X-Men. He revealed to those present his past history on Krakoa. When pressed by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], he declared that he was proud of what they had accomplished, agreeing to submit to all the laws of Krakoa.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}} He was given a place on the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|ruling body of Krakoa]], sitting alongside Xavier and Magneto on the Autumn wing of the Quiet Council.{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}}

Later, the [[Arak Coral]] emerged, and bonded with Krakoa. Apocalypse met the [[Summoner (Arakko) (Earth-616)|High Summoner of Arakko]], who was revealed to be the son of Apocalypse's [[War (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|first Horseman of War]]. The Summoner pleaded to Apocalypse to save them from their enemy.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 2}} Alongside Xavier and Magneto, Apocalypse attended the [[World Economic Forum (Earth-616)|World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos (Switzerland)|Davos]].{{r|X-Men Vol 5 4}}

As depowered mutants joined the nation of Krakoa, a problem emerged. The [[Five (Earth-616)|Five]] possessed the capacity to resurrect these former mutants in mutant bodies; however, this required them to first die. In part to ensure that the Five were not overwhelmed by such resurrections, Apocalypse proposed the "Crucible", a novel ritual of combat to earn the right to die and be resurrected as a mutant once more. The Quiet Council assented to the proposal. The first to undergo the trial was [[Melody Guthrie (Earth-616)|Melody Guthrie]], who faced Apocalypse himself in a sword-fighting duel. Melody refused Apocalypse's offer to surrender, and thus was slain at his hand. She was then resurrected with her powers restored and resumed her mutant name of Aero, much to the pride of Apocalypse.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 7}}

When a [[Gateways|Gateway]] to [[Otherworld]] formed, Apocalypse sought to harness the mutant [[Magic (Power)|magic]] of the dimension, but was blocked from the other side. Apocalypse asked [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Betsy Braddock]] to bring her brother [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]] to Krakoa, hoping to use his power to unlock the gateway. However, the Braddock siblings ventured to Otherworld on their own, only to be ambushed by [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]], who had gained control of [[Camelot]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 1}} Meanwhile, Apocalypse had [[Shilpa Khatri (Earth-616)|Trinary]] bring [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] and [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] to the gate, seeking to have Rogue absorb the power of the gate and thus weaken the magical ward upon it. The sorceress enslaved Brian with her dark magic, and Betsy escaped to Krakoa using the [[Amulet of Right]]. 

Betsy, now Captain Britain herself, arrived on Krakoa, discovering that Rogue had entered a magical coma as a result of her interaction with the Gate. When Betsy traveled to England along with Gambit, Jubilee, and a comatose Rogue to rebuilt the [[Braddock Lighthouse]], they were attacked by the [[Coven Akkaba (Earth-616)|Coven Akkaba]], servants of le Fay. Apocalypse arrived and promised them he would protect the Lighthouse and Rogue while the others went to Otherworld.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 2}} Lacking the proper material to both create a stable gateway to Otherworld and to awaken Rogue, Apocalypse recruited [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Richter]], to serve as a master of Earth and retrieve the bones of ancient mutants. While the rest of the newly reformed [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] were away, Apocalypse watched as monsters from Otherworld emerged to attack the Lighthouse.{{r|{{cl|Excalibur Vol 4 3}}-[[Excalibur Vol 4 4|4]]}} Apocalypse revealed that what happened with Rogue was not an accident, but the latest step in a ritual eons in the making. However, when [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Prestige]] made telepathic contact with Rogue at Gambit's request, the ritual's progress was accelerated. Enraged, Apocalypse beat Gambit into submission. As he went to complete his ritual, Apocalypse discovered that Richter had already spent the energy of the crystals he'd been sent to retrieve. At that moment, Rogue awoke, infused with power, and attacked Apocalypse. He allowed Rogue to absorb his life, realizing that in death his bones would have the power required to complete the ritual and access Otherworld.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 5}} 

Apocalypse was quickly resurrected, a privilege afforded to him due to his place on the Quiet Council. He was then greeted by [[James Braddock Jr. (Earth-616)|Jamie Braddock]], whom he appeared to be in league with. Apocalypse challenged le Fay for the throne of [[Avalon (Otherworld)|Avalon]]; in place of a war, the dispute would be solved by a duel to the death between their champions; Betsy and the possessed Brian, respectively. After Betsy involuntarily defeated her brother, Apocalypse officially announced [[James Braddock Jr. (Earth-616)|Jamie Braddock]] as Avalon's new king. Jamie, also known as Monarch, then imprisoned le Fay and resurrected Brian. This, it seemed, had been Apocalypse's plan from the start. Following their victory, Apocalypse began vivisecting le Fay, seeking to study the physical and biological components of magic.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 6}} 

He then tasked Excalibur with retrieving the skulls of five [[Warwolves]], which were needed for expanding their coven between dimensions.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 7|8}} After finally getting the components he needed, Apocalypse and Excalibur were able to access the [[Starlight Citadel]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 9}} As Betsy confronted the [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Omniversal Majestrix Saturnyne]], Apocalypse gathered all of the High Lords at the volcano of Arak Maw and told them that it was time for the entire mutant population to become equal to them. He and Rictor then proceeded to kill Crule, Saul, Nicodemus, and Candra in order to turn their life force into crystals that would serve as a portal to Otherworld. However, Candra prior to being killed left her gem containing her life force at the Citadel which was picked up by Gambit. Apocalypse contacted Betsy and told her about the gem, and then after seeing it at the hands of Gambit she told him to give it to Apocalypse and he complied, throwing it at the Krakoan portal where Apocalypse got it and finally completed his own portal.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 12}} Following that, Apocalypse went to his grandson, the Summoner, who explained to him what happened to his horsemen, his wife, and the other mutants who remained on Arakko. After that, Apocalypse directed his grandson to the portal to Otherworld where he could return to Arakko, while being accompanied by Unus and Banshee.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 12}}

===[[X of Swords]]===
When the Summoner and an injured Banshee returned to Krakoa after "being ambushed by the Daemons", Apocalypse brought the situation to the council of Krakoa. The Council was angry at Apocalypse for creating the External Gate without their knowledge and permission, but Apocalypse found support from Krakoa itself, who wanted to reunite with its long lost half and didn't allow the Council to destroy the gate. Instead, Apocalypse and his grandson went alongside some volunteers to Otherworld in order to face the threat. Apocalypse was then reunited with his long lost children, and tried to reconnect with them, but instead they and the Summoner assaulted him.{{r|X of Swords: Creation Vol 1 1}} He and Rictor were taken to the [[Healing Gardens]] in order to cure them from Pestilence's poison arrow , but the poison proved to be too strong. As Rictor began succumbing to the poison, Apocalypse demanded [[Healer (Morlock) (Earth-616)|Healer]] save him, but the Healer refused stating that Apocalypse was more important and Rictor would just be resurrected. This caused Apocalypse to attack Healer, but he was then himself subdued by [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]]. Magneto then told Apocalypse that following the complications surrounding [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]]'s failed resurrection, all of the eggs in the [[Arbor Magna|Hatchery]] had been destroyed and they would need time before Apocalypse would be resurrected, while also berating him for his failed experiment.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 4}}

Apocalypse eventually recovered from the infection and alongside Gorgon returned to the [[Temple of the Horsemen]]. There he destroyed the tombs that represented his children and retrieved the four pieces of the [[Scarab (Sword)|Scarab]], since he was one of the [[Swordbearers of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Swordbearers of Krakoa]] who would fight in the Ten of Swords tournament.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 13}}

Apocalypse arrived with the [[Swordbearers of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Swordbearers of Krakoa]] at the [[Starlight Citadel]] one day before the tournament began. There each Champion received a tarot card, with Apocalypse receiving "The Lovers". The card depicted Apocalypse and [[Genesis (Earth-616)|Genesis]] embracing each other. Disturbed, he confronted [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Saturnyne]]. She introduced him to [[Annihilation (Earth-616)|Annihilation]], who revealed herself to be Genesis.{{r|X of Swords: Stasis Vol 1 1}}
Afterwards, Apocalypse and Genesis walked the gardens beneath the Citadel together and discussed what really happened to her and the mutants of Arakko.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 14}} The next morning, the Swordbearers of Krakoa, [[Swordbearers of Arakko (Earth-616)|Swordbearers of Arakko]] and leaders of various realms of Otherworld dined together before the tournament officially started.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 14|15}}
Apocalypse spectated several different contests before Krakoa and Arakko earned even scores. The final contest would be a duel between him and Genesis to decide the winner of the tournament.{{r|Cable Vol 4 6}}
Although Genesis initially dominated the fight, Apocalypse gained the upper hand, but refused to finish her off.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 15}}

As a result, Annihilation asserted control over Genesis{{r|X-Men Vol 5 15}} and ignoring the terms of the contest, attacked, leading Amenthi demons, the Swordbearers of Arakko and several Summoners against the Krakoans, the Starlight Citadel and a reemerging Captain Britain Corps.
There, on the battlefield, Apocalypse engaged Annihilation and tried to reach out to Genesis, but Annihilation took full control of her and blasted him away.
After getting distracted by the [[Vescora]], Apocalypse ambushed Annihilation, slamming her to the ground and ripping the Golden Helm of Annihilation off of Genesis.
It consequently possessed Apocalypse and tried to seize control of him, but without success. As Annihilation, Apocalypse attained full control of the Amenthi forces and surrendered the tournament, and with the tournament concluded, Saturnyne broke up the war.

Saturnyne subsequently removed the Golden Helm of Annihilation from Apocalypse and turned it into a staff, weakening it's influence on the wielder. After giving the staff to Genesis, Saturnyne demanded an exchange of hostages to end the war; one Krakoan would stay in Amenth, while an Arakkan would come to Krakoa.
Genesis chose Apocalypse and Apocalypse chose the mutant island of [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]] itself, which contains millions of mutants, to go to Krakoa.
And thus, Apocalypse accompanied his family to [[Amenth]] after telling [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] to convey a message to Professor X and Magneto; that one day, he will see them again.{{r|X of Swords: Destruction Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = Apocalypse has constantly evolved to survive, increasing his powers over the centuries. His original ability to control his molecular structure was augmented by Celestial technology and further enhanced through the Celestial armor to become the Evolutionary Caretaker.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 186}} He was also exposed to at least two different techno-organic viruses over the years, which he assimilated and made his own.{{r|Cable Annual #1999}}{{r|Cable & Deadpool #26|27}}

*'''Immortality:''' As an External Apocalypse's original body was immortal;{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 11|12}} even before being modified by the Celestial ship, he had lived for thousands of years.{{r|X-Force #37}} Though he has been put out of commission or seemingly destroyed for various periods of time, Apocalypse can not be killed.
*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Apocalypse possesses superhuman strength that he can further increase by drawing upon outside energy sources; Apocalypse was shown to be strong enough to physically restrain the Hulk, while the Hulk was separated from Banner and explicitly lacked the ability to increase his strength with his rage, but also had a stronger base level. Hence, Apocalypse is above the "[[:Category:Superhuman_(75-100_ton)_Strength|Class 100]]" limit.{{r|Incredible Hulk #456}}
*'''Superhuman Speed:''' He is able to speed up his reflexes and reaction time.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #4}}
*'''Superhuman Durability:''' Apocalypse is highly resistant to injury. With the Celestial modifications, this resistance to harm is amplified.{{r|X-Factor #68}}
*'''Teleportation:''' Apocalypse can teleport himself and others around vast distances across the planet. The ability seems to be artificial, linked to the Celestial technology bio-mechanically incorporated into his body, headquarters, and equipment, and so is not always available to him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #295}}
*'''Psionic Manipulation:''' At various times Apocalypse has demonstrated differing but vast levels of mental capacity.
**'''Telekinesis:''' Apocalypse possesses telekinetic abilities enabling him to levitate himself,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #335}} or others, by sheer force of will and manipulate living beings, inanimate objects, and to some extent energy, psionically.
***'''Flight:''' Apocalypse can enable himself to fly, by either transforming his arms into wings, jets, or through telekinetic use.{{r|X-Factor #6}}{{r|Fantastic Four #335}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #336}} He can achieve supersonic velocity in this manner.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #4}}
**'''Telepathy:''' He's also an accomplished mentalist of undefined extent. An example of his power would be him battling a weakened Jean Grey (a vastly powerful telepath in her own right) within the psyche space of Baby Nathan and win.{{r|X-Factor #68}}
***'''Telepathic Control & Manipulation:''' He's able to project his own thoughts and memories or read those of others in order to glean and impart whatever information he desires from them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #335}}
***'''Cyberpathy:''' Thanks to his synergy with the Celestial Technology bonded to him, due in part to his paradoxical jaunt of afflicting Cable with the T.O Virus, Apocalypse gained the ability to mentally link with and control most any kind of tech and machinery he could reach out too.{{r|Cable Annual #1999}}{{r|Cable & Deadpool #27}}
*'''Self-Molecular Manipulation:''' Apocalypse has control over the molecular structure of his own body and can alter it at will. This means he can adapt his molecular structure to adversity. Apocalypse can perform the following feats:
**'''Biomorphing:''' Apocalypse is also a non-terrestrial metamorph, able to elongate like taffy, change into machinery, separate & reattach his own body parts, and even alter his physical appearance at will to blend in with the world around him.{{r|X-Factor #6}}{{r|Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #1|4}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #145}}
**'''Healing factor:''' Apocalypse's control over his bodily molecules allows for his regenerative abilities.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #4}} But Apocalypse when sustaining immense amount of damage that not even he can heal, he can enter a coma-like state of suspended animation during which he may recover from any wounds with the assistance of his Celestial technology.{{r|Cable #-1}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 14}}
**'''Size Alteration:''' Apocalypse is able to change his size at will; he can increase or decrease the size of his body by taking on additional mass or ridding of it from a presumably extra-dimensional source.{{r|X-Factor #68}}
**'''Self-Power Bestowal:''' Due to En Sabah's total control over his molecular and sub-molecular structure, further bolstered by the Celestial technology augmenting him, he can also consciously or spontaneously grant himself with a wide array of new superpowers at will.{{r|{{cl|Rise of Apocalypse #2}}-[[Rise of Apocalypse #4|4]]}}
*'''Celestial Energy Manipulation:''' Apocalypse seems to have a range of energy harnessing and projecting capabilities, either naturally derived or based on Celestial technology built into his physical frame.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #295}} He can use these metaphysical forces to accomplish a great many facilities; such as illusion & memory conjuration, matter reconstruction, healing as well as total physical restoration of damaged or destroyed bodily tissues.{{r|Age of X-Man: Apocalypse & the X-Tracts Vol 1 4}}
**'''Energy Blasts:''' Apocalypse can project raw destructive energy from anywhere on his person, be it as concussive blasts from extremities or even full body energy waves.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #295}}
**'''Energy Absorption:''' He can also absorb energy from outside sources to augment both himself and his overall power.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 3 1}}
**'''Energy Transfer:''' In his time as Murshir, En Sabah found he could share his celestial force with other individuals to enhance their abilities. Similar to how Galactus imparts his power cosmic upon a chosen herald.{{r|Age of X-Man: Apocalypse & the X-Tracts Vol 1 3}}
*'''External:''' Apocalypse is not only immortal like these rare subspecies of mutants, but shares a telepathic-link with his fellow Externals that allows them to not only sense each other and where, but can call on each other at will from great distances. He is also able to sense when one rises from their first death and when one is killed by another External.{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 11|12}} Like the others, Apocalypse has shown to be able to resurrect himself in various ways, but do to being enhanced by Celestial technology and Techno-Organic Virus, he has been able to come back in unique ways from the other Externals.{{r|Cable & Deadpool #26|27}}

| Abilities               = * '''Super-Genius Intelligence:''' Apocalypse is an extraordinary genius, and has knowledge of certain areas of biology, primarily genetic engineering and mutation, and technology that are far in advance of contemporary science and technology.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z #1}}
* '''[[Omnilingual]]:''' En Sabah Nur is fluent in all of human language from across history, including Celestial.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 183}}
| Strength                = Variable; Ability to tap into outside power sources makes his strength level virtually incalculable.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 3 1}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Weakness
| body = Due to Apocalypse being altered by the Celestial technology and his power enhancement was that the Techno-Organic Virus was needed to allow this to happen and because of this; that Apocalypse's body is ravaged by the Techno-Organic Virus itself as he must find and switch bodies regularly by transferring his consciousness and powers into a succession of host bodies abandoning each one when it becomes too weak after burning through each body out faster than the last to contain his full power in order to survive making it very important that the next body is powerful enough to hold his immense power. Most of his replacement bodies must wear an exoskeleton body armor in order to contain the vast amount of the power and energies he has in order to prevent it from consuming him from within, weakening him faster.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 97}}{{r|X-Men: Black - Magneto Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Men: Black - Mojo Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Men: Black - Mystique Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Men: Black - Juggernaut Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Men: Black - Emma Frost Vol 1 1}}

| Equipment               = Several of Apocalypse's bases have a rejuvenation chamber. Apparently [[Celestials (Race)|Celestial]] technology capable of manipulating the genes of mutants giving them altogether new abilities or augmenting the ones they already possess. (The process seemingly has the effect of warping the minds of the subjects more to Apocalypse's way of thinking).{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #184|186}}

* '''Control over Amenth:''' While wearing the Golden Helm, Apocalypse can control the dimension of Amenth.
* '''Hordes of Amenth:''' While wearing the Helm, Apocalypse had full command over the hundreds upon thousands of Daemons native to Amenth.

| Notes                   = * "En Sabah Nur" translates to "The Seven Lights";{{r|Uncanny Avengers #9}} with "Sabah" literally meaning "seven" and "Nur" meaning "light" in Arabic. This is interesting for Islam depicts the eternal afterlife as having seven heavens. Since Apocalypse was born thousands of years before modern Arabic existed, this must either be a translation of his true name, or it is a name in Proto-Semitic that simply coincidentally resembles Arabic words. "En Sabah Nur" can also mean "birth of light", "Awakened Light", and (in literal sense) "Dawn".
** En Sabah Nur is The Seven Lights (really The Morning Light) in Arabic, but the Ancient Egyptians were not Arab nor did they speak Arabic.
* Apocalypse was created as a last minute replacement for the [[Leland Owlsley (Earth-616)|Owl]], a [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] villain who original ''X-Factor'' writer [[Bob Layton]] wanted to use as X-Factor's main villain. When Layton was removed from the book and replaced with [[Louise Simonson]], she requested that the last page of {{cl|X-Factor Vol 1 5}} be changed to a shadowy figured named Apocalypse, as Simonson wanted a new character to be the main villain for the book.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/03/16/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-42/]</ref>
* En-Sabah-Nur was allegedly [[Apocalypse Succession|the eighth individual]] to assume the mantle of Apocalypse in [[Earth-616]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #20}}
* The association in English of the term "apocalypse" with prophetic revelation, an end time scenario, and the end of the world in general, largely derives from a single ancient book. The "Book of Revelation" (1st century), a Christian book of prophesy about the end of this world and the beginning of the next one. In Latin the Book is called "Apocalypsis Ioannis" and the original Greek title is "Apocalypsis Ioannou" (the Apocalypse of John). The English associations of the term have been in use since at least the 12th century.
* The Celestial known as [[Godhead (Earth-616)|Godhead]] has a bit of resemblance to Apocalypse.{{r|[[:File:Godhead (Earth-616) from Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men Black Vortex Alpha Vol 1 1 001.jpg|Godhead's image]]}}
