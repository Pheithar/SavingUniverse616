===S.H.I.E.L.D.===
'''Jack Truman''' was a manhunter for the international espionage agency [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]],{{r|Cable #59}} known as '''Agent 18''' (and only to a few people{{r|Cable #58}} probably less than a dozen). He was so deep inside and covert as his name wasn't attached to anything in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database.<!-- {{r|Cable #59}} -->

Truman despised desk-jobs agents, as well as [[George Washington Bridge (Earth-616)|G.W. Bridge]] (the feeling being mutual), whose leadership skills were questioned by Truman.{{r|Cable #59}}

====Early Missions====
<!-- Years before the Cable mission -->He once had for mission to prevent an allegedly insane [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Timothy Dugan]], in fact an unstable [[Life-Model Decoy]], from killing the [[Presidents of the United States of America|Presidents of the United States]]<!-- unknown which one -->, and consequently tracked him down and cut his throat.<!-- {{r|Cable #59}} -->

Truman went into a stakeout for six months in [[Tunisia]] to catch an embassy bomber who was also a manic depressive: by the time he had closed in, his target had committed suicide. Truman felt cheated of six months of his life, and went in vacation in [[Sudan]] to unwind.{{r|Cable #59}}

====Cable====
On the proposition of [[Seth Waters (Earth-616)|Seth Waters]],{{r|Cable #58}} and despite his vacation, he was deployed to capture the [[Homo superior|mutant]] "terrorist" [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], and was handed all information by [[Agent Gerard (Earth-616)|Agent Gerard]] of [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Foreign Operations Division (Earth-616)|Foreign Operations]]. Though he dismissed him abruptly, he welcomed the mission, as he wanted (and was aware S.H.I.E.L.D. knew that) a challenge to compensate the Tunisia operation. Truman consequently started his manhunt, heading for the [[Swiss Alps]], where Cable had been active and met with Bridge there. From the intel, Truman understood that Cable wasn't a terrorist as alleged, but a hero, which could provide an even better challenge for him. In [[Hell's Kitchen]] (when the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Psi Division (Earth-616)|Psi-Division]] had lost track of Cable, Truman had the agency to buy the [[Ranco Scrap]] abandoned junkyard to use as a cover. Using a [[Psionic Transponder]], Truman unleashed [[Zzzax (Earth-616)|Zzzax]] upon Hell's Kitchen{{r|Cable #59}} in order to test Cable before confronting him. After a brief fight, they were interrupted by [[Lawrence Young (Earth-616)|Laurence Young]], commander of [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Air Cavalry (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D. Air Cavalry]], deployed as Truman was possibly deemed ineffective. Cable was able to grab Truman's weapons, attack the Air Cav, and flee underground. Truman catch up with him and overpowered him.{{r|Cable #60}} As Cable was captured, Truman realized he had been sent to find Cable only, while the Air Cav was to retrieve it, for the purpose of the [[Nemesis Program (Earth-616)|Nemesis Program]].{{r|Cable #61}} He was badly injured during the mission.{{citation}}

He was subsequently transformed into a cyborg to battle the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]].{{citation}}

He later swapped his mind into the body of another former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, [[Lawrence Young (Earth-616)|Larry Young]].{{citation}}

===Teen Brigade===
Truman reappeared later, and played a role in shepherding the [[Teen Brigade (Earth-616)|Teen Brigade]] against the [[Young Masters (Earth-616)|Young Masters]]. He assisted them in their battle against the Masters in the capital of [[Latveria]], where the Young Masters intended to assassinate [[Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)|Kristoff Vernard]].{{r|Vengeance #1|6}}
