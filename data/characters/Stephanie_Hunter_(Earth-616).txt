| History                 = Stevie Hunter was a ballet dancer until a broken leg that never healed correctly forced her to assume a teaching position.

She was brought into the world of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] when [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] was looking for a dance instructor to teach [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]]. [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] immediately had problems with Stevie, seeing her as a threat to her special bond with Kitty.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 139|140}}

When Kitty invited Stevie and Ororo to a [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]] concert, an outburst by the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]] caused the X-Men to reveal their [[Homo superior|mutant]] powers to Stevie.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 148}}  

With their secret out, Stevie became more engrossed in the mutant world and joined the Institute as dance teacher and physical therapist.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 168}}

After [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]]'s attack on the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Mansion]] reduced it to rubble, Stevie returned to her private studio.

When [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] began to possess various X-Allies, he took control of [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] and forced him to attack her. The combined forces of [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] and [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] freed all of Shadow King's captives, and Stevie returned to the Institute.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #278|279}}

When there was an assassination attempt on Xavier's life, Stevie nursed the wounded from the ensuing conflict. Currently, Stevie is back working at her dance studio.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #14}}

Years later, Stevie was elected to represent [[Connecticut (State)|Connecticut]]'s 3rd congressional district in the [[United States House of Representatives (Earth-616)|House of Representatives]] and invited X-Men leader and old friend, Kitty Pryde, to testify before [[United States Congress (Earth-616)|Congress]] on the state of mutant affairs.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 9}}
