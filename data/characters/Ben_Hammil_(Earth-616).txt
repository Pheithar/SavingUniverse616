===Origin===
Little is known about Match's past. When his [[Pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] [[X-Gene|powers]] first manifested, Ben accidentally set fire to a park in his hometown.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #5}} Afterward, Ben was enrolled at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 2 #7}}

===Paragons===
When the Xavier Institute originally began the [[X-Men Training Squads|training squad system]], Ben was placed with [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]]'s [[Paragons Squad (Earth-616)|Paragons]] and codenamed '''Match'''.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #12}} Though short tempered, Match was a natural leader and was eventually made the field leader of the Paragons Squad.{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}

[[File:Paragons Squad (Earth-616) from New X-Men Academy X Yearbook Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Match with the [[Paragons Squad (Earth-616)|Paragons]]]]
Like the rest of his squad, Match was upset and saddened by the departure of Wolfsbane.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #12}} Along with the other Paragons and the [[Alpha Squadron (Earth-616)|Alpha Squadron]], Match was briefly mentored by [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]]. Ultimately, former [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutant]], [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]] stepped in to become the Paragons' mentor.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #14}}{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}

===M-Day and Limbo===
In the wake of [[Decimation|M-Day]], only 27 students (including Match) retained their mutant powers.{{r|Decimation: House of M - The Day After #1}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #20}}{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}} Along with most of the other powered students, Match participated in [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]'s battle royale to become a member of the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #23}}

Match, along with several of his fellow students, was sucked down into the realm of [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]] by [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]]. When attacked by [[Demons|demons]], he quickly joined the fight, showing a great amount of control over his powers, killing several demons while trying to protect [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] and [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #37|#41}}

===San Francisco and Utopia===
[[File:Ben Hammil (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 513 0001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Match with his anger issues]] 

Following the [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|birth]] of the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|first mutant born]] since M-Day and the apparent death of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]], [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] disbanded the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #207}} Shortly after that, the X-Men and the majority of the world's remaining mutant population, including Match, relocated to [[San Francisco]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #500}}{{r|X-Men: Manifest Destiny #2}}

During the rioting over the anti-mutant reproductive legislation, [[Proposition X]], Match was seen putting out fires with [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]]. Later, after the [[X-Men (Osborn) (Earth-616)|Dark X-Men]] declared a city wide curfew, Match was seen in [[Dominikos Petrakis (Earth-616)|Avalanche]]'s bar, with [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]] and other mutants. Angered by the [[United States Senate (Earth-616)|U.S. government]]'s response to the riots, the small group decided to cause a scene of after curfew riots. Match spread fire throughout Union Square until the Dark X-Men came to arrest the trouble-making mutants.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #513}}{{r|Dark Avengers #7}} He was briefly arrested and detained on [[Alcatraz Island]] until being freed by the [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]].{{r|Dark Avengers #8}}{{r|Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Exodus #1}}

Match participated with [[Alani Ryan (Earth-616)|Loa]] and [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]] in their raid on the [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] food storage to steal ice cream. However, he was defeated when [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]] stuck him in a gas stove.{{r|Nation X #4}} Match was also one of the victims of the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] boredom, when they decided to begin trapping fellow students in horrible film-inspired mental illusions. Match was trapped in a well with an Asian ghost girl,{{r|Nation X #4}} probably inspired by [[Wikipedia:The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]].

===[[Schism (Event)|Schism]] and [[Regenesis]]===
Following the [[Schism (Event)|schism]] between [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and Cyclops, Match chose to relocate back to [[Westchester County|Westchester]], and attend the newly opened [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School of Higher Learning]].{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 #1}}

===X-Men Dissassembled===
Match was one of many mutants to oppose the crazed [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] from imposing his version of the world upon the world. When X-Man realized that he couldn't carry out his vision with the X-Men around, he made his enemies vanish in an instant including Match.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 #9|10}}

===Age of X-Man===
Match and the mutants that vanished were taken to a [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|different reality]] created by X-Man as an attempt to create a utopia where mutants could live in peace. The mutants relocated to the reality had their memories erased as they couldn't resist.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha #1}}

Match was one of a group of [[Homo superior|mutants]] that was a follower of [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|En Sabah Nur]] who, along with [[Victor Borkowski (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Anole]], [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Transonic]], and [[Maggott (Japheth) (Earth-616)|Maggott]], were engaged in planning an explosion at the [[Hope Summers Memorial Library]] in order to end the fake memories that had been plaguing them.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen #2}}

While not seen, Match was presumably allowed to leave the reality and return to the real world when X-Man decided to release the mutants he trapped in his reality.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega #1}}

===House of X===
Match later became a citizen of the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] and attended the celebration of Krakoa becoming an officially recognized nation with Rockslide.{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}}

[[File:Ben Hammil (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 38 0001.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Match using his powers]] 
Match is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] with pyrokinetic abilities including: 
*'''''[[Pyrokinesis]]:''''' As with most pyrokinetics, Match has the mutant ability to psionically manipulate molecules in the air, exciting them to burst into flame. Once created, he has absolute control of it. Differing from most though is that his body produces a constant flow of fire and as a result, his body is constantly engulfed in flame and radiates with an orange color. Match can manipulate fire to great extents thus granting him the ability to execute a number of different fire based attacks.
** '''''Pyric Form:''''' Match's body is constantly burning and glowing. His head, in particular, gives off a constant flame. Although his body constantly burns and his temperature is higher than the average human, his body flame is still cooler than an actual flame, which prevents him from burning his clothing.
** '''''Fire Manipulation:''''' Not only is Match able to create fire but he too is able to mentally control large amounts and to great levels.
** '''''Immunity to Fire & Heat:''''' Match is seemingly immune to fire and high temperatures. As a side effect of his powers, thermal production causes his skin to glow with heat and constantly radiate flame from his scalp.
** '''''Energy Based Shield:''''' Match is able to focus the heat he generates into a shield that can cover his body, withstand some energy attacks, and melt most objects upon touch.
** '''''Concussive Blasts:''''' Match is able to release fire from his body as powerful concussive blasts of pure fire and extreme heat capable of dealing out incredible damage.
** '''''Fire Extinguishing/Absorption:''''' Match is either able to absorb or mentally extinguish any fire in his vicinity.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #513}}

| Abilities               = 
* '''''Skilled Leader:''''' Match has shown himself to be a capable team leader.{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}

* Ben's impulsive nature and fiery temper has led some to wonder if it is due to his power.{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}{{r|Dark Avengers #7}} On the other side, he was quoted as giving credence to the [[Lucius Kleinstein (Earth-616)|Doctor Lucius Kleinstein]]'s theories supposing "''a correlation between an individual's personality traits and the nature of their genetic mutation''".{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}}
* It is theorized that by generating enough fire and heat, Match can create thrust below him allowing flight similar to that of a rocket. This would be similar to the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]].
| Trivia                  = 
* Ben's first name was first revealed in {{cl|New X-Men Vol 2 #5}}. 
* Match was the field leader of the [[Paragons Squad (Earth-616)|Paragons Squad]].{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}
* In the {{cl|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}, Match was voted “Shortest Temper.”
* In the {{cl|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}}, Match lists his likes as being in charge and winning, and his dislikes as indecision.
