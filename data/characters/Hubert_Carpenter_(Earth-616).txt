| History                 = Hubert Carpenter lived with Humbert, an eccentric uncle who was also a mad scientist. Humbert used experimental technology to enhance Hubert's physical abilities. Apparently, the dim-witted individual decided to do nothing more with his powers than to make a life of petty crime.{{r|Defenders #131}}

He made his first known appearance as one of the villains battling the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]], only to be taken out by their erstaz associate, [[Eugene Patilio (Earth-616)|Frog-Man]].{{r|Defenders Vol 1 131}} He slipped back into obscurity, surfacing again when the [[Lorina Dodson (Earth-616)|White Rabbit]] wanted to form a league of past Frog-Man villains to gain revenge on the crime-fighting amphibian. This plan ended in failure as well, as the so-called "Terrible Two" were defeated by Frog-Man and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 185}}

===Fear Itself===
[[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], seeing the chaos caused by the rampage of [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|the Serpent]]'s [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]], manipulates the Walrus into thinking that he has been chosen to wield a magical hammer. Unknown to Deadpool, the hammer Walrus received actually did have magical properties when exposed to a full [[Luna (Moon)|moon]]. Greatly strengthened by the hammer's power, the once small time criminal proceeded to cause chaos and destruction in [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]], almost killing Deadpool on multiple occasions. In the end, Deadpool managed to trick Walrus into entering the windowless basement of a sheriff's office where the hammer became powerless and Deadpool could take advantage of the sheriff's weapon's cache.{{r|Fear Itself: Deadpool Vol 1 #2|3}}

===All-New, All-Different Marvel===
Walrus later allied himself with [[Goldbug (Hobgoblin) (Earth-616)|Goldbug]] and White Rabbit, but the trio were captured by [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]]. Taken to [[Ryker's Island|The Cellar]], a recently built maximum security prison run by [[Empire Unlimited (Earth-616)|Empire Unlimited]], Walrus was placed in a glass tube alongside [[Raymond Bloch (Earth-616)|Ox]]. When Ox asked [[Shannon Stillwell (Earth-616)|Shannon Stillwell]] how they are supposed to live like this, Shannon stated that they wouldn't, and then proceeded to put them into stasis within their tubes.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 1}} Walrus was presumably freed alongside all the other Empire Unlimited captives when [[Augustus Roman (Earth-616)|Regent]]'s plans were thwarted by Spider-Man, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], and [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 15}}
