===Early Life===
Jason Strongbow was a representative of the [[Navajo Nation (Earth-616)|Navajo Nation]] of Native Americans, attempted to stop a mining company from excavating a mountain sacred to the tribe by obtaining a court order. Failing in that, he led a peaceful protest group at the mining site. When the night watchman panicked and shot a protester, Strongbow followed him into the mine. There, he discovered that the mining company was in league with [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Ulysses Klaw]] who sought uranium found in the mine to fortify his sonic powers. Strongbow also discovered his brother, Ward, who did not share his ideas of preserving the tribal grounds, and an argument between them soon led to violence.{{r|Marvel Two-In-One Annual #6}}

===American Eagle===
[[File:Jason Strongbow (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1 0001.gif|thumb|left|150px|Original Costume]]
During their fight, Klaw appeared and blasted the brothers with his sonic blaster, causing a cave-in. Trapped in the cavern, Jason and his brother were simultaneously bombarded by radiation from an unknown [[Glossary:I#isotope|isotope]] of [[Glossary:U#uranium|uranium]] and the sonic vibrations of Klaw. Jason emerged from the cavern with superhuman powers that he attributed more to the [[Great Spirit]] of his tribe than to the [[Glossary:M#mutagenic|mutagenic]] effects of the radiation bombardment.

Ward escaped the cave-in earlier and left with Klaw for the [[Savage Land]]. Jason emerged from the mine and was hailed as a champion of his tribe. Taking the flight of an eagle nearby as an omen, Strongbow fashioned a costumed identity of the American Eagle.

Learning that his brother was in the Savage Land with Klaw, the American Eagle set out in pursuit, soon finding himself in the company of the Savage Land protector [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]], the superhero [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]], and the Thing's ally [[Wyatt Wingfoot (Earth-616)|Wyatt Wingfoot]]. The four of them opposed and defeated Klaw. In the course of the battle, Ward Strongbow was killed by one of the miners' bullets.

He was later part of the collection of heroes that stood against the [[Dire Wraiths]].{{r|Rom Vol 1 65â€Ž}}

===Later Adventures===
Jason semi-retired after intervening in [[Bobby Lame Wolf (Earth-616)|Cobalt Tomahawk's]] robbery of the reservation's casino.{{r|Thunderbolts #112}}

Following the [[Civil War (Event)|national dispute]] over the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], Jason decided to protest against the act, which got him listed as an enemy combatant.{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report #1}} He also designed a new costume with fewer stereotypically Native American attributes, including a leather jacket and a helmet resembling the head & beak of a bald eagle. He attempted to prevent [[Oliver Osnick (Earth-616)|Steel Spider]] from direct contact with the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] by persuading him to ease up on his work as a vigilante.{{r|Thunderbolts #112|113}}

When the two were confronted by the Thunderbolts under Osborn, Jason shot [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Moonstone]] with a crossbow bolt. [[Jillian Woods (Earth-616)|Sepulchre]] joined Jason and the Steel Spider, and the three were able to defeat the Thunderbolts. In making their escape, the Eagle defeated and crippled [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]] with ease.{{r|Thunderbolts #114|115}}

After the conflict the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities (Earth-616)|Commission on Superhuman Activities]] cleared him of charges, as his status as a reservation law enforcer made him exempt from the Superhuman Registration Act.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #2}}

Shortly afterward he turned away the [[Desert Stars (Earth-616)|Desert Stars]] who were in pursuit of [[Burchell Clemens (Earth-616)|Cottonmouth]] whose rampage had taken him onto the Rez, Eagle's territory. Finding that Cottonmouth had taken a hostage, Jason defused the situation and forced Cottonmouth to do some restorative justice as recompense.{{r|American Eagle: Just a Little Old-Fashioned Justice Vol 1 1}}

During [[Fear Itself]], a few drug-dealers took [[Mutant Growth Hormone|MGH]] to give them the strength, size, and aura of Natives Americans devils, and create a clash between the natives and their white neighborhood. Their plot was revealed by Jason who also defeated them.{{r|Fear Itself: The Home Front #5}}

Jason later visited [[Roberta Rhodes (Earth-616)|Mrs. Rhodes]], who had been given sanctuary on the Reservation a year ago, to inform her about the situation with [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|her son]]. After a series of events including betting up Rhodes support team and taking down an armored [[Jacob Oh (Earth-616)|faux War Machine]] American Eagle ended up helping War Machine attack an army base to reveal the [[Ultimo (Earth-616)|Ultimo conspiracy]].{{r|War Machine Vol 2 #6|7}}

===Enter the Phoenix===
Not long after American Eagle resurfaced and accepted a part-time position as an [[Agents of Wakanda (Earth-616)|Agent of Wakanda]],{{r|Avengers Vol 8 12}} he became one of many super heroes and super villains summoned by the cosmic force known as the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] for a contest to determine its next host. The Phoenix empowered the assembled champions and had them fight each other in trials by combat.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 40}} American Eagle became one of the contestants who most desired to become the Phoenix, since he wanted to bring power to his people. After emerging victorious from fighting [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]],{{r|Avengers Vol 8 41}} Jason was pitted against [[Shanna O'Hara (Earth-616)|Shanna the She-Devil]] and [[Zabu (Earth-616)|Zabu]],{{r|Avengers Vol 8 42}} but lost to them.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 43}}

| Powers                  = 
'''Superhuman Physiology:''' Due to exposure to an unknown radioactive isotope, The cellular fortification of Strongbow's bodily tissues have increased dramatically, granting him various superhuman physical attributes.
*'''Superhuman Strength:''' Strongbow possesses superhuman strength enabling him to lift about 15 tons, which is enough force to uproot a large tree. Arm Wrestled the Thing.{{r|War Machine Vol 2 #6|7}}
*'''Superhuman Speed:''' Strongbow can run and move at speeds greater than the finest human athlete. His speed is slightly greater than that of the Cheetah, the fastest land animal on Earth, and can reach a top speed of 65 miles per hour.
*'''Superhuman Stamina:''' Strongbow's heightened musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. He can exert himself physically at peak capacity for approximately 5 hours, which is roughly 50 times the stamina of an average human.
*'''Superhuman Durability:''' Strongbow's bodily tissues are somewhat harder and more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human. However, he is far from invulnerable. While can be injured by weapons composed of conventional materials, he can withstand impact forces that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury to show for it.
*'''Superhumanly Acute Senses:''' The American Eagle's sensory organs have also been fortified by the radiation-induced mutation. Like his namesake, the Eagle, he has hyper keen eyesight, able to see at 800 feet what the average human being sees at 20 feet. His senses of smell, taste, and hearing are approximately three times that of an average human being.
