| History                 = 
===Member of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]===
ForgetMeNot has been a member of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] for over six years, likely joining prior to [[M-Day]]. However, due to the nature of his powers, he went unnoticed by his peers and remained absent from official rosters. [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] placed a psychic reminder in his own mind to force him to remember ForgetMeNot's existence once an hour.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 300}}

Among the X-Men, he battled the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]], relocated to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], [[ForgetMeNot (Earth-11326)|'''he''']] was a soldier during the [[Age of X]], and saved the situations for the X-Men countless times, acting as some kind of deus ex-machina for them against the Brood or a [[Supersentinel]] for example.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 300}}

Following the [[Schism (Event)|schism]] between the X-Men, ForgetMeNot relocated to [[Westchester County]] with [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s X-Men.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 300}}

When Professor X was murdered, ForgetMeNot memorialised him. As he had lost his permanent connection with others, he became severely depressed. In an effort to remove his powers, ForgetMeNot sought out [[Michael Pointer (Earth-616)|Omega]] and [[Calvin Rankin (Earth-616)|Mimic]]. ForgetMeNot asked Omega to drain him of his powers, but decided not to go forward with the process when he realized that he could still do good in the world without being noticed.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 300}}

ForgetMeNot returned residing at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]], and occasionally patrolled the grounds, encountering there a disfigured girl who wanted to be part of the outcast group of the X-Men or to die trying. ForgetMeNot managed to help her evade the Mansion's defenses by taking her place in a trap, while developing his own history to her. The girl eventually left, and ForgetMeNot stood trapped, stating even those defenses would forget about him.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 300}} He eventually was indeed released,{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}} but was with a balding-like and scarred back of the head, seemingly courtesy of the defense system.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 300}}

===Targeted by X-Force===
Detected by a series of hints gathered by [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Doctor Nemesis]] ([[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]]'s memory absence and distortions of cameras records of the X-Mansion obtained by [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers posing as "MeMe"]]), he was trapped (using data on his use of supplies and toilet paper and teleported to the [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]]'s HQ, the inactive [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier Pericles]] to be subdued by X-Force, as Nemesis thought he might help them with their problem of [[Yellow Eye Drones (Earth-616)|"insects"]].{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}

As Nemesis recorded himself explaining the situation to the team and left a note to rerun the recording over each time they went coffee-break, X-Force chased ForgetMeNot in the Helicarrier at least a decade of times, unaware that Fantomex was in fact perfectly able to remember him and track him down all along.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}

During this period, ForgetMeNot witnessed some almost erotic interaction between Fantomex and MeMe, [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]]'s insanity and X-Force lack of moral fiber, [[Nathaniel Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] and Psylocke's sexual relations, and even met the maintenance bots of the ship who were able to remember him.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}

Eventually managing to enter dialogue with Nemesis while he was under the effects of his [[Hypercoffee]], he accepted to be used in their plot: Becoming visible by suppressing his powers, allowing one of the [[Yellow Eye (Earth-616)|Yellow Eye]] Drones to target him, then remove the powers' suppressor and track the drone back home. Unfortunately, the bug stood there, able to perceive him, and Fantomex came, and shot him to make the bug leave.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}

With ForgetMeNot apparently dead, both the Yellow Eye members and Nemesis forgot about him, while X-Force mission was a success. His body was simply taken away by the maintenance bots.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}

===Ally of [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]]===
While Cable and Marrow did the interrogation on [[Yevgeny-Malevitch Volga (Earth-616)|Volga]], [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]] learned that the last part of [[MeMe (Mutant) (Earth-616)|MeMe]]'s conscious was in control of the maintenance bots aboard [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier Pericles|X-Force's]] base and the revelation that MeMe saved ForgetMeNot's life after Fantomex shot him.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 13}}

When X-Force returned from one of their missions to counter the now-evil Fantomex's raids on super-agencies, he introduced himself to the team. Quickly assaulted by Marrow, he was freed by Cable once he announced he came with Hope's instructions. He had Marrow touch the comatose Hope, who mimicked her healing powers, allowing her to move her body to a computer, and showed to the team Cable's manipulations of baiting Fantomex into attacking other agencies and superspies.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 14}}

Already forgotten, ForgetMeNot approached Psylocke and thrown her on Hope, who mimicked her telepathy and broadcasted her memories and feelings to X-Force, along with the team's position to Fantomex. As ForgetMeNot explained that fact to Cable and stated it was Hope's plan who was in motion, he grew angry but was quickly taken down by Marrow. X-Force members were giving up, but ForgetMeNot, already forgotten again asked them to stand against Fantomex and weaken him, as part of Hope's plan.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 14}}

Using the diversion made by [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]], Psylocke and Marrow, ForgetMeNot sneaked behind Fantomex and teleport-tagged him into the laboratory, had Hope's hand touching Fantomex (specifically his butt) in order for her to absorb his powers, and ordered Nemesis to bodyslide the enemy out, next to the sun. Nemesis and ForgetMeNot witnessed his approach of Earth, as well as Hope's waking up.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 14}}

While both Nemesis and Hope (who had mimicked Nemesis' powers) were working on a cure for Cable and Fantomex, ForgetMeNot stood by their sides, encouraging them. As time was lacking, he proposed to Hope (who seemingly agreed) to release an army of [[Nathaniel Summers (Clones) (Earth-616)|Cable's clones]] on Fantomex.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 14}}

He later reappeared on the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 9}}

| Powers                  = ForgetMeNot was a [[Homo superior|mutant]] who was stated to be in a state of constant existential superposition: Both real and unreal. ''"He's literally written out of the story"''.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}

Consequently, his abilities include:
* '''Imperceptibility:''' ForgetMeNot is incapable of being perceived or remembered by virtually all individuals. When ForgetMeNot is not directly within view of an individual, his presence, existence, and any memories of him completely disappear.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 300}}
** '''''Telepathic Imperceptibility:''''' Although [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] was able to detect a psi-trace of him, she was later unable to catch it back while ForgetMeNot was only a few meters away from her.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}
* '''Undetectability:''' ForgetMeNot's abilities also interfere with individuals' aim and targeting telemetry of mechanical devices.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 300}}

Once near-to-death, Nemesis, the Yellow Eye members and their drones forgot about him.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}

** After becoming imperceptible, he left people with memory absences,{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 300}} that [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] eventually perceived.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}
** As he still exist, his actions on things can be perceived, like his use of supplies and toilet paper, allowing people to logically conclude that he could exist.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}
** His powers were shown however to be leaving some noticeable distortions on camera records.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}
** A detector trap was able to catch him.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}
** Some kind of tech like [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier Pericles]] maintenance bots, who stated themselves to "invisible too", were able to remember and interact with him.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}
** [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]] was able to detect him. He later revealed he was able to remember ForgetMeNot all along, using his heightnened senses and/or his engineered brain.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}
** He can be psi-tracked, although he was telepathically invisible some instants later.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}
** Using an experimental [[Hypercoffee]], [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Nemesis]] (in ''"a state of mathematical awareness"'') was able to witness him, allowing him to see and remember ForgetMeNot, and even ''"ssssmell in color"'' him.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}} Nemesis' [[Quantum Coffee]] had the same effect.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 13}}
** Even dead, Fantomex and the maintenance bots kept memory and perception of him.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}} It was later revealed that the bots were controlled by [[MeMe (Mutant) (Earth-616)|MeMe]].{{r|X-Force Vol 4 13}}
* ForgetMeNot has no control over his powers.{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 300}}
* According to [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]], ForgetMeNot was overweight.{{r|X-Force Vol 4 10}}
