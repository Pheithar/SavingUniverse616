===Dark Avengers===
The Dark Avengers are a team composing mainly of supervillains and characters with "shady" histories that [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] put together to act as American protectors after being appointed to replace Iron Man rising to power. None of them are seen as real Avengers by the Avenger factions (except Noh-Varr, who later became a real Avenger). The team is now defunct.
