| History                 = Ollerus the Unmerciful was a mighty military commander who sought to take [[Valhalla (Afterlife)|Valhalla]] from [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]]. He started to assemble an army which included two powerful sorcerers, [[Casiolena (Earth-616)|Casiolena]] and [[Poppo (Earth-616)|Poppo the Cunning]], and hid in a mountain shaped like a shark tooth in the hills of Valhalla. Once the Goddess of Death discovered about Ollerus' plan, she summoned [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]], then with the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] in [[Midgard]], to lead her own troops against the rebels. Poppo had a plan to recruit Valkyrie against Hela’s forces, turning the tide of battle to Ollerus’s favor. Amid a struggle between Hela and Ollerus' armies, the mountain moved; causing an earthquake that broke the battle up. Once Valkyrie discovered the origin of the shockwaves, she fell into a trap where Brunnhilde's body would be split from human host [[Barbara Denton (Earth-616)|Barbara Norriss]], who would then pose as Valkyrie.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 66}}

After locking Brunnhilde in a room, through the fake Valkyrie and his henchmen's magic, Ollerus was able to cast death upon many [[Midgard]]ians, including Valkyrie's fellow Defenders [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]] and [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]]. This created an army as large as Hela's.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 67}} The new legions, specially due to the superpowered additions, gained the upper hand and even knocked out an escaped Valkyrie. However, once the Defenders realized the one that drafted them was actually Barbara Norriss, they defected to the underwhelmed Hela troops and gave an advantage. Witnessing this, Ollerus signaled to the mountain, which proceeded to move towards the battlefield; generating an earthquake. Hulk decided to smash the mountain, and upon the base's destruction, Ollerus was defeated. To ensure Ollerus' banishment to [[Niffleheim]] would not lead to further rebellion, Hela banished herself along, leaving Valhalla to  [[Harokin (Earth-616)|Harokin]].{{r|Defenders Vol 1 68}}
