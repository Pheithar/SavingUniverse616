| History                 = Richard Fisk's parents, [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Wilson]] and [[Vanessa Fisk (Earth-616)|Vanessa Fisk]], sent him away to [[Switzerland]]. While there, he attended a school, where he studied hard to make his parents proud. At the same time, he developed his body with regular exercise and told his peers about how rich and successful his father, the Kingpin, was. Then one day he read a newspaper which said his father was the Kingpin of crime and decided to ride a ski lift into the wilderness, never to be seen again. Once the world had believed that Richard Fisk had perished he created the secret identity of the Schemer. As the Schemer the first thing he wanted to do was dethrone the Kingpin and take a piece of the action that he controlled.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #85}} 

Richard successfully drove his father to a breakdown which resulted in his lapsing into a comatose state. Richard had a change of heart and, seeking a way to cure his father, joined [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], rising to the rank of Supreme Hydra of the Nevada faction. Richard cured his father using Hydra's resources, and Wilson Fisk apparently took control of Hydra, but the Fisks eventually discovered that they were being used by the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] and were forced to team up with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] to defeat him.{{r|Captain America #145|148}} Richard was critically injured and placed in suspended animation by his father, who later cured him by siphoning some of Spider-Man's life force into him. Father and son were finally reconciled, though this peace would not last.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #163|164}}

Later, Richard adopted another secret identity in the form of the Rose. After living the life of the idle rich away from his father's criminal empire, Richard was lured back into the criminal world by a reporter, [[Edward Leeds (Earth-616)|Ned Leeds]], who at the time was brainwashed into thinking he was the [[Hobgoblin]]. Ned proposed a complicated scheme where he and Richard would take down the Kingpin in false identities, giving Richard the chance to topple his father and Ned an exclusive crime story for the Daily Bugle. Ned had already assumed the role of the Hobgoblin, and convinced Richard to become the Rose, acting as a mid-level crime boss in Kingpin's territory.{{r|Web of Spider-Man #29|30}} Unknown to Richard, he was actually being manipulated by the real Hobgoblin, [[Roderick Kingsley (Earth-616)|Roderick Kingsley]], who used Leeds as a brainwashed body double to lure Richard into his own plans for takeover of the New York underworld.{{r|Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives #3}}

As the Rose he employed two henchmen, [[Mr. Varley (Earth-616)|Mr. Varley]] and [[Mr. Johnston (Earth-616)|Mr. Johnston]] to help fix the results of football games. Spider-Man helped expose this and Bugle sports writer [[Wendy Thorton (Earth-616)|Wendy Thorton]] was able to get an exclusive on these illegal match fixings.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #253}}

When Ned was killed and the Hobgoblin seemingly died with him, Richard Fisk was forced to admit his schemes to his father and go back into the Kingpin's service without succeeding in his plans.{{r|Web of Spider-Man #30}} Later still, Richard assumed the identity of the Blood Rose. This was part of a complicated scenario where his friend Alfredo had plastic surgery to pose as Richard in his father's organization, but went too far and got lost in the role. Richard was forced to become the Rose again, and then Blood Rose, in order to stop "Richard Fisk".{{r|Web of Spider-Man #84|89}}{{r|Web of Spider-Man #97|100}}

Emotionally drained and morally devastated by this point, Richard collapsed into alcohol. He remained a nominal part of his father's organization, but was otherwise beaten and washed up. At one stage he formed an alliance with an old friend [[Samuel Silke, Jr. (Earth-616)|Sammy Silke]] and they tried an assassination attempt on his father Wilson, which failed. Upset at what he had tried to do, his mother Vanessa arrived from [[Switzerland]] and promptly killed him.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 29|31}} Wracked with guilt over her son's death, Vanessa retreated back to Switzerland where she wasted away and eventually died.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 92}}

Some time later, the [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Jackal]] brought Fisk back to life in a new [[Glossary:Clone|cloned]] body; back as [[Rose|The Rose]], Fisk decided to stay with the Jackal, serving him at [[New U Technologies (Earth-616)|New U Technologies]] with other resurrected Spider-Man's villains.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 2}} Spider-Man told [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Wilson Fisk]] that he saw Richard at New U.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 3}} Richard was presumably among the majority of the people cloned back to life by the Jackal that died once again after [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] triggered their decay.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 5}}

Following this second death, Rose went to [[Hell]], where he received a high ranking position. When [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Johnny Blaze]] asked Rose for help in usurping [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]]'s throne, Rose refused, fearing how Mephisto would punish him if he helped Johnny and he failed, but he did give Johnny a map to the throne room.{{r|Damnation: Johnny Blaze - Ghost Rider Vol 1 1}}

In a desperate attempt to resurrect Vanessa, the Kingpin embarked on a quest to secure both the Tablets of both [[Lifeline Tablet|Life and Destiny]] and [[Tablet of Death and Entropy|Death and Entropy]], which would grant him the power for a one-time resurrection. Despite his initial desire to reunite with his wife, Fisk ultimately came to the realization that Vanessa might not be pleased with her resurrection. Acknowledging that he had to move on from her, Fisk decided instead fo revive Richard as an act of redemption for himself and Vanessa.{{r|Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: King's Ransom Vol 1 1}}

After readers were engaged by the mystery of the identity of the [[Hobgoblin]], DeFalco decided that he needed to make the Rose a known character. He had settled on [[Roderick Kingsley (Earth-616)|Roderick Kinglsey]], but the Rose’s identity didn’t get revealed until DeFalco had left {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1}}, so the plans changed.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/post/117515141933/well-the-real-reason-is-a-lot-more-complicated|title=New Brevoort Formspring — "Well, the real reason is a lot more ...|work=Tumblr|first=Tom|last=Brevoort|date=27 April 2015|accessdate=16 May 2021}}}}
