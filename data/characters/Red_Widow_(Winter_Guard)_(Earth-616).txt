| History                 = The silent Red Widow was the latest product of the [[Black Widow Ops Program (Earth-616)|Red Room]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 10}} Originally a homeless girl, she was brought into the program when she was seven years old.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 41}} As a result of the Red Room's rigorous training, the Red Widow's body is covered in scabs and scars.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 44}}

Following the [[Russia|Russian]] government's decision to revamp their nation's premier super-team, the [[Winter Guard (Earth-616)|Winter Guard]], the Red Widow was appointed as a member of the unit. Despite [[Dimitri Bukharin (Earth-616)|Crimson Dynamo]] acting as the leader of the Winter Guard, Red Widow often called the shots. During battle, she observed silently from a distance in order to report to her superiors.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 10}}

After [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Count Dracula]] surrendered himself to the Russian government under the pretense that he was weak and in the final days of his life, the Red Widow was tasked with interrogating him. To this end she rounded up Dracula's consorts and began killing them,{{r|Avengers Vol 8 16}} which forced him to disclose every last one of his secrets. Shortly afterward, the Winter Guard was attacked by the [[Legion of the Unliving (Vampires) (Earth-616)|Legion of the Unliving]], who were in the search for Dracula. Red Widow was the last member of the Winter Guard left standing until the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] arrived.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 17}}

When the cosmic force known as the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] returned to Earth, it staged a contest to determine its next host, and the Red Widow was one of many individuals summoned to the [[White Hot Room]] for it.

Emerging from the ocean floor, Echo absorbed the portions of the Phoenix within Shanna and the Red Widow before doing the same to the other participants in the process of fully becoming the Phoenix.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 44}}
