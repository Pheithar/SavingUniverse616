| Overview                = Known by many names, '''Erik Lehnsherr''' is a powerful [[Category:Jewish Characters|Jewish]] [[Homo superior|mutant]] who walks on gray areas to protect his race as '''Magneto''', the master of magnetism. During his youth, he endured atrocities performed by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi dictatorship]] in [[Auschwitz-Birkenau|Auschwitz]]. After escaping, he learned at this cost of his [[Anya Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|own daughter]]'s life that he had the mutant ability to generate and control magnetic fields, a condition that caused additional hate and fear from those who were different from him.{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 12}} After being a target for so long and explicitly rejecting the possibility of any harmony with humans, Magneto aimed to conquer the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as ''Homo superior'', to become the dominant species on Earth.{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 19}}

Decided to disseminate his beliefs by employing brute force, he got into direct conflict with his former ally, [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Charles Xavier]] and his [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], mutants who shared a dream of peaceful mutant-human coexistence, on several different occasions.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Men Vol 1 112}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 150}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 1|3}}{{r|Fatal Attractions}}{{r|Magneto War}}{{r|Eve of Destruction}} His reputation as an inspirational figurehead and a dangerous threat, as the leader of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood]] and the [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]], granted him the rule over the kingdom of [[Genosha]],{{r|Magneto War}} until its destruction.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 114|116}} Magneto also had the X-Men as his allies in different occasions, expressing his intentions to try Xavier's way{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 200}} and even his students' perspective, by following [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 515|516}}

| History                 = 
===Early life===
Max was born and raised in [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]] by a middle class [[Jewish]] family. While attending a local school he became attracted to a young [[Romany (Earth-616)|Romani]] girl named [[Magda Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magda]], the daughter of the school cleaner. Max would do things such as create necklaces and excel in sporting events to gain her attention. While returning from school one day, Max encountered a Nazi rally and found his uncle [[Erich Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Erich]] beaten and wearing a sign saying that he had shamed a German woman (as he was Jewish and she was not). Not long after, at a school event, Max won a javelin competition to impress Magda, and the following day was accused of cheating (following the belief that a Jewish boy could not exceed his classmates). Max was told to either give up his medal or recreate the throw with a "regulation" javelin. After winning the competition a second time, Max was again accused of cheating, expelled, and beaten by the other children.{{r|X-Men: Magneto Testament #1}}

===Escape from Germany===
[[File:X-Men Magneto Testament Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Persecuted by the Nazis]]
After traveling with his father [[Jakob Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Jakob]] to see Major [[Jurgen Scharf (Earth-616)|Scharf]], whom he saved in [[World War I]], his father was left waiting for the major and beaten by a troupe of [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazis]] for "making such a trouble" in Scharf's office and resisting arrest. After hours of beating, Major Scharf threw Jakob out of his office, stating that they would have killed him and that they were even. As things worsened in Germany, Max's father taught his family "fight back, and they'll stomp in your head",{{r|X-Men: Magneto Testament #2}} but fled to Warsaw, [[Poland]] after [[wikipedia:Reichskristallnacht|Reichskristallnacht]].{{r|X-Men: Magneto Testament #3}}

There they lived in the Jewish section of Warsaw where the Nazis built the [[wikipedia:Warsaw ghetto|Warsaw Ghetto]] in October 1940. His time in the ghetto molded Max into a smuggler of food and supplies. When the Nazis started to deport ghetto inhabitants to [[wikipedia:Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka extermination camp]] in July 1942, Max and his family escaped from Warsaw. On their way to their hideout, they were captured by Nazi soldiers. As they were about to be executed, Jakob saved Max's life by pushing him out of the firing line without anyone noticing. The corpse and Max were buried in a mass grave.{{r|X-Men: Magneto Testament #3}}

===[[Holocaust (Event)|Holocaust]]===
[[File:X-Men Magneto Testament Vol 1 4 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Max imprisoned at [[Auschwitz]]]]
After being found, Max spent his early teens imprisoned at the Vernichtungslager (extermination camp) in [[Auschwitz-Birkenau|Auschwitz]], Poland.{{r|X-Men: Magneto Testament #4}}

In 1944,{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #7}} Max witnessed [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] and geneticist [[Josef Mengele (Earth-616)|Josef Mengele]], operating at Auschwitz.{{r|Excalibur Vol 3 7}} Max didn't trust him and, consequently, became a [[Sonderkommandos (Earth-616)|Sonderkommando]] to avoid selection. Cleaning out the furnaces of the crematoria, he discovered the bodies of his friends who had been picked, turned into monsters.{{r|Excalibur Vol 3 7}} The only member of his family to survive the Holocaust, Max learned first-hand how brutally [[Homo sapiens|human beings]] could treat those they considered different.{{r|X-Men: Magneto Testament #5}} Max was unable to access his [[Homo superior|mutant]] powers at puberty, like most, due to a bout of hepatitis from working in the camp.{{Citation}}
[[File:Magda Eisenhardt (Earth-616) and Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from X-Factor Annual Vol 1 4 001.jpg|right|thumb|Max and Magda]]
While in Auschwitz, Max was reunited with [[Magda Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magda]] and continued to smuggle food and supplies to her. Max saved Magda from the gas chambers and then from execution; as the Sonderkommando revolted, the two of them escaped together. For several years, Max and Magda lived in a Carpathian mountain village, and eventually they were married. They had a daughter, [[Anya Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Anya]].{{r|Classic X-Men #12}}

===Erik Magnus Lehnsherr===
Max, at this point, sought out a forger named [[Georg Odekirk (Earth-616)|Georg Odekirk]], who was supposed to be among the best, and asked him to create a new identity for him. Odekirk fabricated the existence of "Erik Lehnsherr, the Sinti gypsy," so that Max could live more easily among Magda's own people. Max added "Magnus" as his middle name and, although many knew of his history as a Jewish prisoner, no one knew of his life as Max Eisenhardt. Not satisfied with the simple life of a mountain village, Erik moved his family to the then-[[USSR|Soviet]] city of [[Vinnytsia]] so he could better himself. On their very first day in the city, Magnus consciously used his powers for the first time. Erik magnetically hurled a crowbar at his boss who was cheating him of his pay. When he returned to the inn where Magda, Anya, and he were staying, Erik saw that it was on fire and his daughter Anya was trapped on the upper floors. He tried to use his new-found powers to save his daughter, but his boss had called the KGB and they beat up Magnus and held him down, preventing him from rescuing Anya. The child fell, burning to her death, in front of her father. Magnus then used his powers to destroy the men holding him, the crowd watching, and a large section of the city of Vinnytsia in revenge. Terrified by her husband's powers and overwhelmed by the tragedy, Magda fled, unknowingly pregnant with twins. As Magnus attempted to bury his daughter, more soldiers arrived after hearing what he had done and attacked him. After being shot in the head, Magnus forced the soldiers to turn their own guns on themselves.{{r|Classic X-Men #12}}

Eventually Magnus traveled to [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], possibly under the guise "Erik Magnus". Magnus worked there as a volunteer orderly at a psychiatric hospital for Holocaust victims. It was there Erik first met and became friends with [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]]. Magnus and Xavier frequently debated the subject of mutants' coexistence with the rest of humanity, though neither revealed to the other that they were mutants. After the two men joined forces to rescue their friend, [[Gabrielle Haller (Earth-616)|Gabrielle Haller]], from [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron von Strucker]] and his [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] agents and revealed their powers to each other, Magnus seized Hydra's Nazi gold and left for parts unknown, realizing his and Xavier's views were incompatible.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #161}}

===Mutant War===
For some time after, Magnus attempted to stay on the path of righteousness and used his powers to help track Nazi war criminals. However, while working for one of the Western intelligence agencies (most likely the [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|C.I.A.]], the British SIS, or [[MI6 (Earth-616)|MI6]]), Magnus was also working for [[Mossad (Earth-616)|Mossad]], the Israeli Secret Service, and instead of turning the Nazis over to his "control" government after he found them, he was giving them over to Israel for trial. It seems his "control" knew about Magnus' status as double-agent, and let him give the Nazi war criminals to Israel, as long as they were Nazis that the [[USSR]] had optioned. When Magnus captured and attempted to give Nazi Hans Richter to Israel, agents from the unnamed Western intelligence agency decided to put an end to his activities. They murdered Magnus' girlfriend at the time, Isabelle, right in front of his eyes. In a rage, Magnus killed his "control" and cohorts and vowed from that time on, he would be called "Magneto". Magneto then began planning his campaign against the human race. Magnus later found himself in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]], under the guise "Michael Xavier", where he had learned that mutants were gathering and hiding from humans in plain sight. Magnus asked [[Cassandra Michaels (Earth-616)|Cassandra Michaels]] to create his first uniform, stating that with all of the colorfully costumed heroes and villains walking the [[Earth]], it was imperative that he do the same to make a statement. After accompanying Cassandra on a date, they were attacked by an underground monster and Magnus entertained the idea of becoming a hero, but after feeling Cassandra was ungrateful, realized that his heart lay elsewhere.{{r|Magneto Vol 2 1}}

Years later, Magneto reemerged in costume and helmet, designed to shield him from [[telepathy]]. He was determined to conquer the human race, to prevent their oppression of mutants, as the self-proclaimed savior of mutantkind. Magneto had also created an orbital space station, [[Asteroid M]], to use as a base and began to assemble his original [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. One of his early recruits, [[Astra (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Astra]], was simply infatuated with Magneto and could care less about the mutant cause, but she left the group under mysterious circumstances before it made its first public appearance. Simply needing powerful mutants in the coming war, Magnus recruited twins for the Brotherhood after he rescued them from a mob of ignorant humans, but was unaware that they would one day be presumed to be the children that Magda had hidden from him. [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Pietro]] soon wished to leave constantly and [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Wanda]] disagreed with Magneto's evil ambitions, but Wanda felt that she owed Magneto her life and Pietro would never leave her side. It was certain at this time that Magneto was in a psychotic and manic state, brought on by a combination of factors, including the overuse of his immense powers. On the anniversary of his liberation from the Vernichtungslager extermination camp, Charles Xavier, now a professor and confined to a wheelchair, met with Magneto in Auschwitz. Professor Xavier pleaded with Magneto that the actions he would set into motion were no different than what the Nazis did to him years earlier, but Magneto laughed and patronized the professor for claiming to lead mutants, but being confined to a chair. Professor Xavier replied that he may have lost the use of his legs but not his heart, something Magneto could not say. After both men reminded each other that they had the power to destroy the other, Magneto left, with Professor Xavier hoping that he saw the error of his ways.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 -1}}

===X-Men and the Brotherhood===
[[File:X-Men_Unlimited_Vol_1_7_Pinup_002.jpg|thumb|right|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]
Professor Xavier's original team of [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] thwarted Magneto's first act of genetic terrorism in his war with humanity, the takeover of the [[Cape Citadel]] missile base.{{r|X-Men #1}} When they next clashed, Magneto overthrew the government of [[Santo Marco (Country)|Santo Marco]], setting himself up as absolute ruler, and led his original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants,{{r|X-Men #4}} which included Wanda and Pietro, now known as the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Not until years later would Magneto learn that they were allegedly his children. After the X-Men liberated Santo Marco, Magneto kidnapped [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] and the X-Men followed to Asteroid M. Asteroid M was destroyed in the battle with the X-Men, when Scarlet Witch sabotaged a button, designed to kill the X-Men.{{r|X-Men #5}}

Later, while the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants battled the X-Men at Hammer Industries, Magneto and his troops withdrew from battle after the arrival of a [[Sentinels|Sentinel]]. Around this time, the [[Evolutionaries]] sought the help of Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, viewing Magneto as the leader of all mutantkind. After the Brotherhood kidnapped [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], Magneto took her to [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] to use [[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebro]]. [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] created a device that shut off their access to cosmic rays and accidentally killed two of the Evolutionaries. When [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] vowed to protect mutantkind, the sole remaining Evolutionary reluctantly left, but not before erasing the memory of their presence from the minds of the X-Men and Brotherhood and vowing to return one day.{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 3 12}}-[[X-Men Vol 3 15|15]]}}

Magneto then attempted to recruit both the Thunder God, [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]],{{r|Journey into Mystery #109}} and the King of [[Atlantis]], [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]],{{r|X-Men #6}} into his Brotherhood, but both refused. While convincing Namor, Magneto commandeered his [[Atlanteans|Atlantean]] army and attacked, but was beaten by Namor and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]. The [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]] was the next candidate for recruitment, but he ultimately declined to join, after seeing the way Magneto mistreated his followers.{{r|X-Men #7}} Magneto briefly battled the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] while attempting to use [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] as an ally in assaulting a government research facility developing a new cosmic power source, but Black Bolt only pretended to succumb to Magneto's mind control device, and the royal family defeated Magneto.{{r|Amazing Adventures Vol 2 #9|10}} During an encounter with the enigmatic [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]], Magneto and the [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]] were captured and taken to the Stranger's home world for study.{{r|X-Men #11}} Shortly after, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch joined a revamped version of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], led by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Avengers #16}}

Magneto escaped from the planet on his own, leaving the Toad behind, but was then re-captured by the Stranger, who had been warned by Professor X.{{r|X-Men #18}} Then, Magneto was accidentally returned to Earth by [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Dane Whitman]] and attempted to force Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver back into his Brotherhood. Magneto traveled with the twins to the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] [[United Nations Headquarters|Building]], where he demanded that mutants be given their own country. Quicksilver managed to send a distress call to the Avengers and they joined the X-Men in defeating Magneto. As his island base was destroyed, Magneto was thrown from the escaping helicopter by Toad, tired of Magneto's constant abuse.{{r|Avengers #53}} Seeming to perish, Magneto managed to escape a drowning death by using his magnetic powers to burrow through the earth.{{r|X-Men #63}}

Magneto retreated to the [[Savage Land]] and genetically altered the natives into the [[Savage Land Mutates (Earth-616)|Savage Land Mutates]], who worshiped him as The Creator. Here, he utilized the help of some of these natives to create a device that would permit him to channel energy to him. Investigating the supposed suicide of [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]], the X-Men again stumbled upon Magneto's plans and, after Magneto revived the life of Angel, they destroyed his machines and citadel, seemingly killing him.{{r|X-Men #62|#63}} Magneto survived due to a strange radiation in the Savage Land, and upon his resurrection, the X-Men battled him again. Magneto destroyed the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|X-Mansion]] and defeated the X-Men, but a distress call was sent to the Avengers. After capturing the Avengers also, Magneto controlled both groups to kidnap scientists to create atomic devices that would create for him an army of mutants to command. The heroes were saved after [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] used his powers to take possession of [[Piper (Savage Land Mutate) (Earth-616)|Piper]] and knocked Magneto unconscious.{{r|Avengers #110|111}}

At one point, Magneto came across what seemed to him to be a treasure trove of alien records and scientific equipment, which had actually been left for him to find by the master geneticist, [[Maelstrom (Earth-616)|Maelstrom]]. Using these resources, Magneto genetically engineered a being called [[Alpha (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]],{{r|Defenders #15}} who rebelled against him and turned Magneto into an infant.{{r|Defenders #16}} Professor Xavier placed the baby into the care of his colleague, geneticist [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]] at the [[Mutant Research Center]] on [[Muir Island]]. Dr. MacTaggert tried to alter Magneto's genetic structure, so his brain -- his mind -- would be able to handle the enormous energies he controlled and he wouldn't be driven insane again. Dr. MacTaggert hoped, given time and the right upbringing, Magneto would grow up to become a better man. However, not long after, the [[Shi'ar]] [[Davan Shakari (Earth-616)|Davan Shakari]] (alias Erik the Red), returned Magneto to adulthood, albeit younger than before.{{r|X-Men #104}} Magneto, thereafter, had a series of battles with Professor Xavier's new team of X-Men. First, Magneto battled the X-Men for payment for Erik the Red restoring his age. Magneto later formed a new Brotherhood comprised of [[Byron Calley (Earth-616)|Burner]], [[Ned Lathrop (Earth-616)|Lifter]], [[Peter Quinn (Earth-616)|Peeper]], [[Randall Darby (Earth-616)|Shocker]], and [[Aaron Salomon (Earth-616)|Slither]], but when they failed to capture the mutant with two bodies known as [[Mister One and Mister Two (Earth-616)|Mister One and Mister Two]] and lost to Captain America, Magneto abandoned this team.{{r|Captain America Annual #4}}

Magneto next found himself in [[Latveria]] and was disgusted at the level of obedience that the citizens showed to [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Dr. Doom]]. After attacking Doom in [[Castle Doom (Doomstadt)|his castle]], Doom defeated Magneto, who propositioned they rule the world together. Doom declined and subjected Magneto to a mind-controlling neuro gas. After administering the antidote, Doom suggested that Magneto attempt to stop him from controlling the world himself. Magneto traveled to the Avengers and briefly battled them before he informed them of Doom's plans. The Avengers were then ordered by Doom to kill Magneto; Magneto realized that Beast was fighting the control. After rescuing Beast and erasing the effects of the gas, Magneto and Beast went to the [[Champions of Los Angeles (Earth-616)|Champions]] for assistance. Upon arriving, the Champions also attacked the duo before they informed them of Doom's plans. They all traveled together to [[Washington, D.C.]] and confronted Doom, who had the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] attack them. After the arrival of the Champions, [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] shed the effects of the gas and aided the duo. Magneto was poised to defeat Dr. Doom until Doom reversed the effects of Magneto's powers and he withdrew from battle.{{r|Super-Villain Team-Up #14}}{{r|Champions #16}}

Magneto later rescued the X-Men from [[Mesmero (Vincent) (Earth-616)|Mesmero]], who had controlled them to perform in a circus, and had them imprisoned by his robot, [[Nanny (Magneto's Robot) (Earth-616)|Nanny]], while he destroyed aerospace installations in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].{{r|X-Men #111|113}}

[[File:Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from X-Men Vol 1 111 0001.jpg|thumb|left|"Rescuing" the X-Men from Mesmero]]
Due to the rapid re-aging of Magneto by Eric the Red, Magneto's body had been healed of the damage he'd done to it by the overuse and abuse of his powers. His mind however had taken longer to heal, as his brain needed to rewire itself, and the damage wasn't easily repaired. Therefore, after a brief time of more psychotic behavior, Magneto began to calm down and think about his past. After Cyclops and [[Aleytys Forrester (Earth-616)|Lee Forrester]] stumbled upon his island base in the [[Bermuda Triangle]], Magneto decided that he would take control of all world governments and end the nuclear arms race, but the Soviet submarine, Leningrad, attacked him. After destroying the sub and all crew members aboard, Magneto, by sheer force of will, created a volcano in the city of [[Varykino]], destroying it. Magneto battled the X-Men again, but underwent a crisis of conscience after almost killing young [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Sprite]], a fellow mutant and Jew, and abandoned his plans of world conquest.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #150}}

After finding the bodies of two murdered mutant children hanging from a swing set, Magneto rescued the X-Men from an attack by the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]]. After capturing their attackers, Magneto and the X-Men tortured them for information and rescued [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]], who was being pursued by Purifiers. After arriving at [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Reverend William Stryker]]'s base, Magneto and the X-Men rescued Cyclops and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], and Magneto resuscitated them. Professor X was taken to [[Madison Square Garden]], where he was attached to a machine that, using his telepathy, would kill all living mutants. Magneto, with his psi-shielded helmet, distracted the Professor enough for the X-Men to destroy the machine. Televised, Cyclops entered into a debate with Stryker about his actions and Stryker pulled a gun, attempting to kill Kitty. Before he could fire, Stryker was shot down by a police officer. Later at the X-Mansion, Professor admitted that Magneto was right and began to accept his offer to join, until Scott stopped him and stated that he believed in the Professor's dream and would see it come true. Professor X then declined Magneto's offer, stating he would not leave his students. Magneto left, calling them fools.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #5}}

===Secret Wars===
After rebuilding his space station, Magneto was among those that were teleported to an area of space-time near a galaxy far from the vicinity of Earth's. Similarly, a large number of costumed criminals, including the [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]], Doctor Doom, [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]], the [[Amora (Earth-616)|Enchantress]], [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang]], the [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Lizard]], the [[Owen Reece (Earth-616)|Molecule Man]], [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]], the [[Dirk Garthwaite (Earth-616)|Wrecker]] and the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]], as well as the planet-devourer [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]], found themselves in another construct within this same area of space-time. Aboard the constructs, the passengers watched in awe as the galaxy nearest to them was annihilated by an unseen force, except for a single star. Then, before their eyes, a planet, which became known as [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]], was created to orbit that star. Finally, a rift opened in space-time, from which poured a blinding light, and the passengers within the constructs heard a voice telling them, "I am from beyond! Stay your enemies and all you desire shall be yours! Nothing you dream of is impossible for me to accomplish!" The passengers were then sent to Battleworld. There, over the next several days, they engaged in a "secret war" among themselves; most of the criminals sought to destroy the heroic adventurers in order to gain the prize that the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] had promised.

The heroes saw Magneto as a villain, and he decided to stay out of the direct conflicts and become a third party, creating his own fortress. The bizarre circumstances caused Magneto to think of what he and humans had in common, surprising the longtime mutant supremacist.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 2}} After battling the heroes for their power supply, Magneto kidnapped and seemingly seduced the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]]. Later, Magneto took responsibility of watching Galactus' movements. After Professor X noticed Galactus was attempting to feed on Battleworld, the X-Men and the heroes battled him. During his time there, Magneto was mostly allied with the X-Men. After Dr. Doom absorbed energy from Galactus and the Beyonder and killed all of the heroes, [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] revived them all. After the Beyonder regained his powers, he and Doom disappeared and the heroes willed themselves back to Earth.{{r|{{cl|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 1}}-[[Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 12|12]]}}

===Lee Forrester===
After being returned to Asteroid M, the arrival of [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]] crashing through his space station sent Magneto plummeting to Earth.{{r|New Mutants #21}} Magneto landed in the ocean, where he was saved from a shark attack from Cyclops' ex-lover, Lee Forrester.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #188}} Lee took Magneto to his old base in the Bermuda Triangle and nursed him back to health, despite his distaste for humans.{{r|New Mutants #23}} Lee warmed Magneto's heart after saving his life and the two became lovers.{{r|New Mutants #28|29}} On the following day, Lee was reminded of the monster that Magneto once was and left him. Around this time, the [[Registration Acts|Mutant Registration Act]] was passed, that called for all mutants to register with the government, forfeiting their civil rights and making it illegal to be an unregistered mutant.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #199}}

===Joining the X-Men and Leading the New Mutants===
Feeling the return of the Beyonder, Magneto once again joined forces with the X-Men. This time, due to Prof. Xavier's weakened state from being attacked by a group of mutant haters, Magneto temporarily joined the team. Magneto began using the alias Michael Xavier to avoid detection from authorities. Completely out of character, Magneto stopped [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]] from killing a human that shot at her, stating that she would only prove them right: that mutants are murderers. While visiting the National Holocaust Memorial with Shadowcat, Kitty was amazed to learn that Magneto knew her grandaunt and saved many lives in Auschwitz. Suddenly, Magneto was attacked by the [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]] and gave himself up for trial by the World Court. Magneto's old friend, Gabrielle Haller, was his defense attorney and [[James Jaspers (Earth-616)|Sir James Jaspers]] prosecuted him. The trial was disrupted by an attack from [[Fenris (Earth-616)|Fenris]], the twin children of Baron von Strucker, and Professor Xavier was almost killed. As Professor Xavier lay dying, the Shi'ar Majestrix, [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Lilandra Neramani]], appeared so she could take him into outer space to be healed by their science. At this point, Professor Xavier begged Magneto to take over for him and be headmaster of the School for Gifted Youngsters for the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]]{{r|Uncanny X-Men #200}} and Magneto began splitting his time between being a member of the X-Men and teacher for the New Mutants. With the X-Men, Magneto again battled the Beyonder.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #202}}

Later, [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers (Phoenix)]] decided to simply destroy the entire universe and have it all start over without the Beyonder. Phoenix stole the life force of the X-Men and [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]], but Storm's soul convinced her otherwise. After hearing the thoughts of every living being in existence, Phoenix returned the X-Men and Starjammers to life. This event also made Magneto rethink his methods of genocide for a "greater good".{{r|Uncanny X-Men #202|203}} While the X-Men rebuilt [[San Francisco]] after the battle with the Beyonder, the New Mutants were obliterated from existence by the virtually omnipotent Beyonder and then recreated by him, angry that Magik refused his 'gift' of her power being transferred to Shadowcat, to use them as guinea pigs. In being recreated, the New Mutants somehow lost much of the proficiency in using their superhuman powers that they had learned at Professor Xavier's school and seemed detached. In time, Magneto's fears, insecurities, paranoia, and temperament slowly began to get the best of him and he was emotionally persuaded by [[Manuel de la Rocha (Earth-616)|Empath]] into having the New Mutants join the [[Hellions (Earth-616)|Hellions]], to see if the [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|White Queen]] could help. Upon realizing the manipulation, Magneto raced to rescue the children and was attacked along the way by the Avengers, believing Magneto was planning to kidnap the children. After the New Mutants arrived to rescue Magneto, he and Emma worked together to cure the children of their trauma at the hands of the Beyonder.{{r|New Mutants #37|40}} After being turned into [[X-Babies (Mojoverse)|X-Babies]] by [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]], the X-Men battled the New Mutants until they were broken of their brainwashing and defeated the spineless one.{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 10}} At this time, Magneto was offered a position in the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] and upon entering the [[Hellfire Club Building (New York)|building]], he recognized that [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] were in fact the original X-Men. Magneto left the building unsure.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #210}}

The X-Men later attempted to rescue the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] after [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Sinister]]'s [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] began to indiscriminately [[Mutant Massacre|massacre]] them. Magneto was charged by Storm to stay at the mansion, watch over the New Mutants, and tend to the wounded.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #211}} [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] was injured by [[Janos Quested (Earth-616)|Riptide]]'s shurikens, which caused energy leaks in Colossus' body without penetrating his armored skin. Magneto used his power to mend the wounds, but Piotr was left in a state of temporary paralysis. The New Mutants wandered into the tunnels to help at the same time [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] created an enormous burial fire for the murdered Morlocks, and the New Mutants were thought dead as well.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #211|212}} After being propositioned, Magneto later joined the Hellfire Club as co-[[White King]] of the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)#Inner Circle Lineups|Inner Circle]] at Storm's behest, and accepted [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] as a member of the X-Men. The union between the Hellfire Club and the X-Men would give the X-Men access to all of the Hellfire Club's government secrets and protect the school if the Marauders were to attack again.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #219}} 

Unwilling to watch her die, Magneto went to [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic)]] of the Fantastic Four to use a device that Mr. Fantastic had built to save [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]].{{r|Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men #1}} Unsure of the outcome, Mr. Fantastic refused to help Kitty, even after the X-Men begged him, and the X-Men and Fantastic Four briefly battled after [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] burned Storm's arm.{{r|Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men #2}} At that time, Dr. Doom presented his assistance and, under duress, Storm accepted.{{r|Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men #3}} At the urging of [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]], Kitty was cured by the combined efforts of Dr. Doom and Mr. Fantastic.{{r|Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men #4}}

After learning that pieces of his space station, Asteroid M, had fallen to Earth, Magneto left the X-Men to travel to Kampuchea on his own and retrieve the technology in it. Magneto was intercepted by the Avengers, and the X-Men arrived to aid him before the [[Super-Soldiers (Earth-616)|Super-Soldiers]] and [[Dimitri Bukharin (Earth-616)|Crimson Dynamo]] arrived.{{r|X-Men vs Avengers #1}} The three teams fought over Magneto and, in the confusion, the X-Men slipped away with him. Magneto left the X-Men again to get the tech on the space station, and after finding it, began wearing his old helmet again. After the Avengers showed again, the X-Men came to Magneto's aid and they left with his tech while destroying the rest of Asteroid M.{{r|X-Men vs Avengers #2}} After arriving in [[Singapore]], the team took a Dutch freighter and were boarded by the Super-Soldiers while at sea. Fearing that he was endangering the team, Magneto again left the X-Men.{{r|X-Men vs Avengers #3}} Arriving back in Singapore, Magneto was sheltered by an underground group of mutants and brought to the Galleria, where they asked him to lead them against human oppression. After Magneto informed them that he was no longer that man, soldiers burst in and began firing and Magneto saved them. Magneto then went to the X-Men and Avengers and revealed his technology, a device in his helmet that would mix with his magnetic powers and give him control over any mind he chose. Magneto declared that he had modified the circuitry to remove all traces of prejudice, particularly toward mutants, from the collective minds of the human race and not to rule them. After using the device on [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], Magneto learned that Cap never hated mutants and agreed to go on trial again. Magneto was once again defended by [[Gabrielle Haller (Earth-616)|Gabrielle Haller]] and prosecuted by [[James Jaspers (Earth-616)|Sir James Jaspers]] in [[Paris (France)|Paris]]. After fearing that his death would spark a war between mutants and humans, Magneto called his helmet from Singapore to Paris, and used it on one of the judges, Alexandre Gilbert Du Motier, who acquitted him of his crimes in the world court.{{r|X-Men vs Avengers #4}}

Magneto destroyed the helmet{{r|X-Men vs Avengers #4}} and returned to his position as headmaster of the Xavier School, attempting to connect more with his students, after learning that they had returned as well. Magneto, notably, connected with [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Illyana Rasputin]], who had lost her brother, Colossus; best friend, Shadowcat; and control over her realm, [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]],{{r|New Mutants #50|52}} after the attack of the Marauders.{{r|New Mutants #46}} Magneto also grounded the New Mutants for their impulsive, reckless behavior. After a soccer game became too physical, [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] ended up giving [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]] a concussion and, after the rest of the New Mutants began to chastise him, Sunspot ran away, feeling he was a danger to his team. Warlock followed after Sunspot and this left all of the team feeling deeply guilty and worried about Warlock and Sunspot's whereabouts.{{r|Fallen Angels #1}} To calm them down, Magneto dressed them elegantly in preparation to attend a Hellfire Club event and asked Dr. MacTaggert to assist in the administration of the school.{{r|New Mutants #53|54}}

After hearing about the mistreatment of an animal creature after capture, the New Mutants abducted [[Bird-Brain (Earth-616)|Bird-Brain]] and after returning home, [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]] decided to return to the [[Massachusetts Academy]].{{r|New Mutants #56}} Following an incident at a mall, Magneto decided to turn over Bird-Brain to the authorities, but after Cypher began to speak with it, the New Mutants convinced him that Bird-Brain could be taught and remain at the mansion.{{r|New Mutants #57}} Magneto awoke one night to the return of Sunspot and Warlock but the disappearance of the New Mutants.{{r|New Mutants #59}} Magneto ordered Sunspot and Warlock to stay put while he used the technology at the Hellfire Club to locate the New Mutants. While at the Hellfire Club, Magneto witnessed X-Factor's battle with [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] and the current X-Men die on television. When the children returned, they informed Magneto that [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]] was killed in action by the [[Ani-Mator (Earth-616)|Ani-Mator]]. A furious Magneto magnetically held the children and forbade them from ever leaving the school without his presence or using their powers, stating that he needed to protect them. Retreating to Limbo, Illyana returned in her Darkchylde form with her [[Soulsword]] and attacked Magneto, stating that she was wrong about him being her knight in shining armor. The New Mutants separated them and she returned the sword to Limbo. Magneto blamed himself for Doug Ramsey's death as well as [[Homo sapiens|Homo Sapiens]] and contacted Doug's parents (telling them Doug was killed while the students were on a field trip in a hunting accident), while cursing Professor Xavier for leaving him in this position. Magneto's temper rose daily, threatening the New Mutants that if they would not follow his demands, he would make them.{{r|New Mutants #60|61}}{{r|New Mutants #64}}

After [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Mirage]] interrupted a training session of Cannonball's, Magneto ordered the children never to use their mutant powers without his permission, a fact that Sunspot immediately defied and stated that Magneto didn't give them their powers and they could use them as they pleased. After scolding Sunspot, Magneto received a call from Emma Frost, stating that Magma had been kidnapped. Magneto, the White Queen, and the Inner Circle left to rescue Magma, unaware that the New Mutants had already rescued her and overheard Magneto stating that the [[Purifiers (High Evolutionary) (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] had almost foiled their plan for Magma.{{r|New Mutants Annual #4}} After allowing Cannonball to attend his [[Lila Cheney (Earth-616)|girlfriend]]'s concert, after he promised not to use his powers, Magneto, on the phone with the White Queen, was overheard again by the New Mutants, stating that he was prepared for the events to come and willing to go as far as using power neutralizers, an act that angered the New Mutants. They left to aid Cannonball with a battle that broke out at [[Lila Cheney (Earth-616)|Lila Cheney]]'s concert. Responding to his summons at the Hellfire Club, Magneto donned his old helmet and a similar red and purple suit and attended the meeting. Leader [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]] berated Magneto for his students rash acts, but the White Queen came to his defense.{{r|New Mutants #67|70}}

The Inner Circle battled a reign of demons that descended upon [[Manhattan]] from a portal in [[Times Square]]. After the portal was closed, the Inner Circle was approached by the demon, [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]], who offered a truce with the Hellfire Club and proposed that if they would allow him Manhattan, he would give them the rest of the world. The New Mutants witnessed Magneto and the Inner Circle meeting with N'astirh and lost all trust in him. After the defeat of the demons, Shaw argued with Magneto for his lack of control over his student, Illyana, and the demon invasion as a result. Magneto and Shaw began to fight, arguing which path that mutants should follow, ending in disagreement.{{r|New Mutants #73}} Returning to the school, Magneto and the Inner Circle arrived just in time to save the New Mutants from the Marauder, [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]], who explained that Mr. Sinister destroyed the mansion. Magneto was shocked and angry to learn that Illyana had become a child again to stop the demonic invasion, and Sunspot instigated a battle between the Inner Circle and the New Mutants, until Magneto trapped all of the New Mutants in a metal ball. Shaw accused Magneto of having lost all of the control the Hellfire Club had petitioned his membership for, and the two battled. Magneto stated that he joined the X-Men, led the New Mutants, and entered the Hellfire Club to build a foundation for control and peace among mutantkind. Magneto said that the teams were to be his army against the coming war between humans and mutants and the New Mutants heard it all. After defeating Shaw, Shaw stated to the other Inner Circle members that if Magneto stayed, then he would not and was voted out of the Inner Circle. Magneto declared himself "Grey King", both Black King and White King, and allowed the New Mutants to leave, stating that in time they would find his way right.{{r|New Mutants #75}}

Wanting a contingency plan if things didn't work out with the Hellfire Club, Magneto rebuilt a fancier version of Asteroid M. Magneto left the New Mutants so he could play villain again for the world, he would explain to Dr. MacTaggert, so the world would focus on him as the highest profile mutant terrorist. Magneto felt he could not be a substitute for Professor Charles Xavier, that he could not adopt Professor Xavier's methods, and that Professor Xavier's way was not his way.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #253}}

===Rogue===
He next appeared in the Savage Land where he met X-Man [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] where they both fought a crazed [[Zala Dane (Earth-616)|Zaladane]], who had stolen the magnetic powers of both [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] and Magneto. Zaladane was defeated brutally by Magneto. Rogue left the Savage Land in anger and in tears as Magneto declared that he and she could not be on the same side.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #273|275}}

===Acts of Vengeance===
Seeing conditions for mutants grow progressively more perilous, Magneto began seeking allies to protect mutants from humanity. He participated in the "Acts of Vengeance" alongside such established villains as [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]], and the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]]. He also confronted [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]], an unrepentant Nazi war criminal, on whom Magneto took revenge by entombing him alive.{{r|Captain America #367}}

===Acolytes===
Eventually tired of the constant state of strife, Magneto built a new orbital base, [[Avalon (Space Station)|Avalon]], where he hoped to live a life of quiet seclusion. He was, by this point, a figurehead for the cause of mutanthood and was sought out by a group of new mutants calling themselves the [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 1}}

After this, Magneto set his sights significantly lower than world conquest; he wanted only a haven for mutantkind. He first attempted to make the orbital base known as [[Asteroid M]] such a haven, but was opposed by the governments of the world and the X-Men. The X-Men did not know whether or not Magneto was returning to his villainous ways, so they confronted him. Feeling betrayed by his former allies, Magneto escaped after a brief skirmish in which he sustained near-fatal injuries from [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 1}}

Shortly after, Magneto renewed his war with the human race and the X-Men, and gathered about him his team of mutant underlings, the Acolytes, who virtually worshiped him.

The [[United Nations Security Council (Earth-616)|United Nations Security Council]], in response to a resurgent Magneto, voted to activate the "Magneto Protocols" -- a satellite network, in slightly lower orbit than Avalon, which skewed the Earth's magnetic field enough to prevent Magneto from using his powers within and from returning to the planet's surface. The attempt to limit him was met with an electromagnetic pulse-wave that not only destroyed the satellites, but deactivated every electronic device on Earth within minutes. Xavier and a select team of X-Men traveled to Magneto's orbiting Avalon base to confront him. During the battle, Magneto used his powers to extract the adamantium from Wolverine's skeleton, causing him tremendous agony. Infuriated, Xavier used his mental powers to shut down Magneto's mind.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 25}}

For a time, the Acolytes cared for Magneto at their orbiting base, and [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]] claimed to speak the word of Magneto even while Magnus was incapacitated. When Avalon was destroyed by [[Holocaust]], however, Magneto returned to Earth in an escape pod with Colossus.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #42|43}}

===Joseph===
Subsequently, an amnesiac man emerged calling himself [[Joseph (Earth-616)|Joseph]], possessing powers over magnetism, and the appearance of Magneto if he were still in his twenties.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #327}} He joined the X-Men, who believed him to be Magneto, somehow rejuvenated and reformed. Joseph himself came to believe he was Magneto, until the real Magneto reappeared and began his campaign of terror against the human race anew.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #350}}

===Sabra's Discovery===
It was at this time that [[Ruth Bat-Seraph (Earth-616)|Sabra]], a mutant Mossad agent and member of Xavier's Underground, discovered that "Erik Lehnsherr the Gypsy" was a complete forgery, and she revealed this information to Gabrielle Haller. Sabra would declare a personal war against Magneto, whom she now regarded as a traitor to the human race, mutantkind, and their Jewish people.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #72|73}}

===Genosha===
After seizing control of the planet's magnetosphere from the north magnetic pole and blackmailing the world into creating a mutant nation, the United Nations ceded to Magneto the island nation of [[Genosha]], which had no recognized government, as a homeland for mutants. At this time, however, Magneto had nearly lost and exhausted his powers by influencing the poles.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 87}}

Magneto was met with armed resistance on Genosha. He used [[Fabian Cortez (Earth-616)|Fabian Cortez]], and then Polaris, to augment his powers and was able to gain control of all parts of Genosha, after battling the Avengers and destroying the city of [[Carrion Cove]]. Hidden in caves above Carrion Cove was a device that Magneto knew would restore his powers to dangerous levels, and he attacked his alleged children, Wanda and Pietro, who tried to stop him from using it. Once he accessed this genetic enhancer, he regained his powers over the electromagnetic spectrum, but the overwhelming energies drove him psychotic and manic once again.{{r|Magneto: Dark Seduction #1|4}}

After the [[Legacy Virus]] was cured, Magneto suddenly found himself with tens of thousands of healthy mutants on Genosha. He sought to raise an army from this mass of disaffected, recently-cured mutants. [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] formed an interim X-Men team that was barely able to stop him. Wolverine again struck a critical blow, gutting Magneto and reportedly severing his spine.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 113}}

Magneto, recovering and wheelchair bound, was attended to by Polaris. She had always had a Magneto-father fixation, and now she stole what she thought was a tissue sample of Magneto's, had it genetically cross-matched with a sample of her own, and discovered that she was actually Magneto's biological daughter.{{r|New X-Men #132}}

==="Death"===
When new mega-[[Sentinels]] attacked Genosha, Magneto was still wheelchair-bound and suffering from his injuries to the point that he could not effectively use his powers. It appeared that he was killed in the attack, but in truth, he survived after he was hidden in a shelter by his followers. Months after the event, a team of X-Men searching in the debris found what was apparently a recording of Magneto's last words. Mutant-supremacist ideas, attributed to him, became widespread in the mutant community, with some holding him as a martyr of the mutant cause. Magneto had become a Che Guevara-like revolutionary figure in the mutant community. T-shirts and posters with Magneto's face and the phrase "Magneto Was Right" became popular items, even amongst certain students in the Xavier Institute.{{r|New X-Men #135}}

Around this time, an impostor by the name of [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]] emerged and wreaked havoc in [[New York City]] in the guise of Magneto. All the while, Magneto gradually found his way out of the Genoshan rubble, and somehow survived until he was apparently contacted by Xavier. Magneto had no memory of what happened to him, from the time the mega-Sentinels attacked to the time Xavier contacted him. With the world again thinking Magneto was dead, as Wolverine had beheaded the Magneto impostor in New York, Xavier and Magneto decided to work together to help rebuild Genosha, rekindling their friendship in the process.{{r|Excalibur Vol 3 1}}

===[[House of M]]===
Magneto's "daughter", the Scarlet Witch, lost her grip on reality following a reminder of the death of her children, and attacked her fellow Avengers, forcing a distraught and remorseful Magneto to come to her aid after she was rendered unconscious by Doctor Strange. In Genosha, Magneto had heard Wanda's psychic cry for help and, using a wormhole, whisked her away before the Avengers could stop him. Back in Genosha, Magneto tended to a more withdrawn and angry Wanda, and allowed only Xavier to visit in the belief that Xavier could help mend Wanda's broken psyche. As Magneto was forced to consider euthanizing his own daughter for the good of the entire world, as her reality-altering powers were spinning out of her control, Pietro convinced his sister to use her powers to create [[Earth-58163|a world]] wherein they would have everything they wanted.{{r|House of M #1}}{{r|House of M #8}}

In the new reality Wanda created, mutants were the dominant species on Earth, and Magneto was the sovereign of the world's mutants, ruling his subjects from Genosha. Magneto had been granted dominion in this realm after revealing an alleged international anti-mutant conspiracy involving [[Richard Nixon (Earth-58163)|Richard Nixon]] in 1979.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 10}} Believing Magneto to be the one responsible for the change in their world, a group of heroes, who had their memories of the "real world" restored by [[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|Layla Miller]], banded together and attacked Magneto in Genosha. During the battle that ensued, Layla was fortunate enough to be able to restore Magneto's memories, as she had done for the others. When Magneto found out about Pietro's role in warping reality, he attacked him, enraged at all that he had done in his name, and killed him by ultimately crushing his body under the weight of a Sentinel.{{r|House of M #2|8}}

Driven mad by anger and grief over Magneto's treatment of her brother and his violence towards his children, Wanda blamed her father for what Pietro and she had become, declaring that he had always loved mutantkind more than his own children. Out of spite, she altered reality once more, declaring "No More Mutants." At her command, the mutant population of Earth had been decimated, and if not for [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] and [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] there would have been no mutants left at all.{{r|House of M #8}}

===Powerless===
Magneto was left powerless, along with most of the world's mutant population, and with no more mutant births, the species that Magneto had dedicated his life to fight for was headed towards extinction. The X-Men left him amidst the ruins of Genosha, a broken and shell-shocked man.{{r|House of M #8}}

When Quicksilver came to Genosha to restore the mutants' powers with the Inhumans' [[Terrigen Mist]], Magneto condemned his actions, pointing out the disastrous effects the Mists had on non-Inhumans. An angry Quicksilver, frustrated at never being able to win what he believed to be his father's approval, attacked Magneto with his new powers gained from the Mists, savagely beating him until his daughter [[Luna Maximoff (Earth-616)|Luna]] begged him to stop. When the Inhumans later came looking for their Mists, Magneto told them what had happened.{{r|Son of M #5}}

Thereafter, the Collective (a being comprised of energy from all the former mutants' powers) re-powered Magneto and revealed itself as Xorn, the impostor who had devastated New York. Xorn explained that he took the image of Magneto because he knew mutants would follow him, but that they needed the true Magneto once again. Magneto, not in control of himself, began attacking the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] and [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents that Xorn nearly destroyed while he pleaded for them to kill him. He was taken down with a direct attack to his brain from Inhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Daisy Johnson]]. [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]], and [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|the Sentry]] combined their powers and sent the Collective/Xorn into the sun. Michael was separated from the Collective and an unconscious Magneto was loaded into a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter. The helicopter, however, exploded upon take-off through unknown means; his body was not found among the rubble.{{r|New Avengers #20}}

Afterward, Magneto was being searched for by the U.S. government, the Morlocks, and the X-Men. Professor Xavier was unable to locate Magneto with [[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebro]], despite the increase in power to his recently restored telepathy. Xavier and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] found traces of Magneto paying his respects at a local graveyard, standing in front of a tombstone belonging to one of his very first henchmen. Also, the Morlocks came after Magneto for reasons of their own and used him to justify their terrorist acts.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #487}}

Magneto spoke to a crippled, depowered Morlock, claiming he had lost what once made him superior, implying that the restoration of his powers by the Collective was indeed temporary. However, when [[Sally Blevins (Earth-616)|Skids]] found him at a local cemetery sometime later, she gave him a mysterious book that [[Masque (Earth-616)|Masque]] had in his possession. It claimed to chronicle the future of mutantkind, and in it, the book stated Magneto was still a mutant.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #491}}

Apparently at the behest of Exodus, Magneto appeared to help restore the broken psyche of Professor Xavier. He claimed that he was still powerless while he reminisced about the past between the X-Men and the Brotherhood with [[Karima Shapandar (Earth-616)|Omega Sentinel]]. Together they managed to revive Xavier before being attacked by [[Joanna Cargill (Earth-616)|Frenzy]]. Magneto wounded Frenzy by firing a medical laser into one of her eyes, prompting Exodus to ask what punishment he would have instilled on a human who injured a mutant (as the Acolytes considered him a human, Exodus even claimed that Magneto was dead and that Lehnsherr was just a shell that was left over). Magneto replied "Death" and Exodus proceeded to choke him with his telekinesis before Xavier challenged Exodus on the astral plane. After Xavier defeated Exodus, he left Magneto and Karima to try and rebuild his lost memories.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #208|210}}

===Regaining Powers===
Magneto re-emerged in San Francisco, his powers artificially recreated by a suit designed by the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]]. He reactivated Sentinels to attack the X-Men at a "mutant kische" event in San Francisco. The attack itself was a distraction, so the High Evolutionary could gain an unknown object from the [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|Dreaming Celestial]], in order to further a shared goal between Magneto and the High Evolutionary.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #500}}

After extensively examining the Dreaming Celestial, the High Evolutionary subjected Magneto to an extremely dangerous technological procedure in an attempt to restore his powers, which succeeded.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #507}} Since the Evolutionary's equipment was destroyed in the process of re-powering Magneto, he could not use the process to reverse the Decimation effect. Magneto then traveled into space to find another way of saving mutantkind, but to no avail.

===Nation X===
[[File:Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 516 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Magneto bowing at Cyclops]]
Shortly after the funeral of [[Yuriko Takiguchi (Earth-616)|Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi]] on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] (previously known as [[Asteroid M]]), Magneto confronted the new inhabitants of his former home. Magneto stunned everyone by telling them he had come in peace and wished to speak with Cyclops. Professor Xavier was unconvinced, believing the entire ruse to be a trap and attacked him telepathically. In spite of this, Magneto did not fight back. Instead, he got down on his knees and repeated his peaceful intentions. Cyclops ordered Xavier to stand down and agreed to talk with Magneto, but kept [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] close by in case Xavier was right. Magneto expressed his admiration to Cyclops for finally doing what he and Xavier couldn't: uniting mutantkind. Magneto feared that mutantkind was doomed until Cyclops told him that [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], the mutant messiah, was alive and well.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #515|516}} In order to gain the X-Men's trust, Magneto brought Kitty Pryde back to Earth, cracking the bullet and bringing Kitty out of it. Because of the duration and severe intensity of using his powers, Magneto was rendered comatose. During an attack from [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]] on the X-Men, Magneto came out of his coma and defended the many inhabitants from the Nimrods.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #520|522}}

===Magneto Goes Public===
[[File:Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 534.1 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Magneto saves [[San Francisco]]]]
With his reputation around the world as a well-known mutant revolutionary/terrorist, Magneto was talked into finding a solution to the problem by Cyclops before it could go public that he was a resident of Utopia. [[Kate Kildare (Earth-616)|Kate Kildare]], a "superhuman public relations specialist", advised him to adopt a costume color scheme containing white, along with getting the public to "love and fear" him, both of which he refused. With an earthquake inbound for San Francisco, Magneto used his powers to stabilize the city's buildings, structures, and metal vehicles, and to smooth the earth movements themselves, thus preventing any major damage and saving many lives. As a result, the city began to favor him.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #534.1}}

===[[Regenesis]]===
In the aftermath of the [[Schism (Event)|Schism]] between Cyclops and Wolverine, Magneto took [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]' side and joined his [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|Extinction Team]]. When footage was released of Magneto murdering several anti-mutant activists, Magneto was surprised as he was miles away with Cyclops while the massacre was perpetrated. They were then called into a meeting with Captain America and Iron Man to discuss it and Cyclops vouched for him, giving Magneto a chance to prove his innocence.{{r|Magneto: Not a Hero #1}} The real perpetrator was a resurrected [[Max Eisenhardt (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Joseph]] who had been brought back by [[Astra (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Astra]], along with a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants composed of deformed clones of the originals.{{r|Magneto: Not a Hero #2}} 

Joseph sought to bring back the fear that Magneto's name once commanded and allied himself with anti-mutant activist [[Christopher Bach (Earth-616)|Christopher Bach]], who wished to sully Magneto's name and make mutants appear more dangerous to further his agenda. Joseph berated Magneto for allying himself with the X-Men and "going soft", which Magneto countered by saying that he was doing what he always had: fighting for the survival of the mutant race by any means necessary. Magneto kidnapped Astra and forced her to reveal Joseph's plans, which were to kill all people at a pro-humanity rally.{{r|Magneto: Not a Hero #3}} Magneto arrived in time to thwart Joseph's plans and save the people. He killed all the clones and incapacitated Joseph, who was then locked in the [[X-Brig]]. However, Christopher Bach was killed by Magneto during the chaos, who pretended not to know what happened to him.{{r|Magneto: Not a Hero #4}}

===[[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers vs. X-Men]]===
When war broke out over what to do about the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] coming to Earth, Magneto sided with his fellow X-Men against the Avengers. When the Avengers invaded Utopia, he fought Iron Man, and the two took their fight to outer space. As Magneto drew power from another planet, he sensed the planet being destroyed by the Phoenix, which distracted him long enough for Iron Man to defeat him. The X-Men feigned a surrender and proceeded to teleport out of Utopia.{{r|AVX: Vs #1}}

[[File:X-Men (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 13 001.jpg|thumb|right|Magneto, Storm, and Psylocke having a toast.]]
Magneto waited in a safe house with [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] and [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] while [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]], and [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] engaged the Avengers on the moon. After Iron Man used an experimental weapon on the Phoenix Force, it split into five pieces, inhabiting the five X-Men present on the moon. The [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]] used their vast power to end wars, hunger, disease, and thirst on the Earth and created a global utopia. The Avengers continued to oppose them, believing that the five would eventually lose control.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 13}}

The Avengers managed to defeat Namor after he had invaded [[Wakanda]], resulting in his portion of the Phoenix going to the other four. Later, Colossus and Magik knocked each other out after having a falling out (manipulated by a beaten [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]]), resulting in Cyclops and Emma as the last two Phoenix left. After receiving all that power, Cyclops and Emma begin to lose control. Emma began a reign of tyranny over the X-Men, threatening those whose thoughts displeased her. Magneto attempted to reason with her, to no avail. Magneto then called out to Professor X, telling him they needed his help. The Avengers, Xavier, and the X-Men united to take on the Phoenixes. Magneto participated in the final battle, but when Cyclops took the final piece of the Phoenix from Emma and became [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Dark Phoenix]], he was knocked out. Cyclops was defeated by both Hope Summers and Magneto's daughter Wanda, and Hope dispersed the Phoenix and used it to re-spark mutations around the globe.{{r|{{cl|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 11}}-[[Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 12|12]]}}

Despite aiding the X-Men and the Avengers against Cyclops and Emma, Magneto became a fugitive, like the other members of the former Extinction Team, but managed to remain hidden due to [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]]'s aid. He made contact with Cyclops and asked if he should break him out, but Cyclops refused the idea. He then went on to find some of the former members of the Extinction Team: Magik and [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]]. He tracked Colossus down as well, but decided that it would be best to leave him alone due to his suffering for his sister's betrayal. He informed Storm of Colossus' whereabouts, leaving his fate up to her.{{r|{{cl|AvX: Consequences Vol 1 2}}-[[AvX: Consequences Vol 1 3|3]]}} He, Magik, and Danger received a message from Cyclops to break him out and head towards the jail. They succeeded in breaking Cyclops out, and together they set out to protect the new mutants.{{r|{{cl|AvX: Consequences Vol 1 4}}-[[AvX: Consequences Vol 1 5|5]]}}

===Mutant Rebellion===
Magneto, Cyclops, and Magik began liberating mutants who had been unjustly imprisoned by various authorities and offer them help with controlling their powers and joining their rebellion. While attempting to liberate [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], Magneto and Cyclops discovered they had both lost control of their powers. Emma revealed that she has been going through a similar situation, and told them that the Phoenix had altered their mutant powers. As Magneto protested, saying that he wasn't a host, Emma told him that since Cyclops hit him with a heavy dose of Phoenix energy, he was also affected. Cyclops vowed to find a way to fix them all. After Emma joined they started a new school for mutants in the old [[Weapon X]] facility.{{r|{{cl|All-New X-Men Vol 1 1}}-[[All-New X-Men Vol 1 5|5]]}} Magneto also pretended to serve as a disgruntled informer for S.H.I.E.L.D. but it turned out to be an attempt by him to infiltrate the organization.{{r|{{cl|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 1}}-[[Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 3|3]]}}

===AXIS===
Magneto later left Cyclops' X-Men and used his intelligence, resources, and contacts to track down various anti-mutant hate crimes and make sure that those responsible paid for their sins.{{r|Magneto Vol 3 1|7}} During one of his quests, he discovered a group of [[Mutant Growth Hormone]] traffickers, and after killing them, he abducted their scientist in order to perfect his MGH formula to restore his powers.{{r|Magneto Vol 3 8}}

[[File:Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 25 page 13.jpg|thumb|left|Beating down the Skull]]
After discovering that the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] turned the remains of [[Genosha]] into a mutant concentration camp, Magneto tried to infiltrate it and take down the villain. However, he was captured by the Skull's [[S-Men (Earth-616)|S-Men]].{{r|Magneto Vol 3 9}} After being rescued by some of the mutant members of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]] which had previously been abducted to Genosha,{{r|Magneto Vol 3 10}} Magneto managed to kill the Red Skull. However, the villain reappeared shortly after combined with [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers #25}}

The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], and their allies later arrived to help fight the Red Onslaught after his existence was discovered. However, the Red Onslaught soon deployed [[Stark Sentinels|his own variant of Sentinels]] made specifically to combat super heroes.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #1}} Because of this, Magneto left the battle to recruit an [[Astonishing Avengers (Earth-616)|army of super villains]] to defeat the robots and the Red Skull.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #2}} In order to finally stop the [[Red Onslaught]], the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom performed a spell to invert the axis of his mind, which accidentally affected everyone in the island,{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #3}} turning heroes into villains, and vice versa.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #4}}

When the Scarlet Witch set out to have revenge on Doctor Doom for having manipulated her, Magneto and Quicksilver tried to stop her.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #6}} During the fight, the Scarlet Witch cast a spell meant for those with blood ties to her; to his surprise, Magneto wasn't affected by it, discovering he had no blood ties with whom he believed to be his daughter and her twin brother.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #7}}

When Doctor Doom returned with the resurrected [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Doctor Voodoo]], they used Voodoo's brother [[Daniel Drumm (Earth-616)|Daniel]] to possess Wanda so they could cast a reinversion spell.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #8}} When the reinversion spell was cast, Magneto returned to his normal personality.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #9}}

[[File:Magneto Vol 3 1 Cassaday Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]
After the events of [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]], Magneto found himself the leader of a band of mutant refugees on [[Genosha]], who had just escaped the mutant concentration camps built by the Red Skull on the island.{{r|Magneto Vol 3 12}} He caught the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D., and surrendered to the authorities only to heavily damage the helicarrier from the inside and delete the agency's files on mutants.{{r|{{cl|Magneto Vol 3 14}}-[[Magneto Vol 3 15|15]]}}

Magneto was approached by [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]], who told him of the [[Glossary:Incursion|Incursions]], an event in which two alternate universes collide with each universe's Earth as the point of impact. Namor was preparing to betray the [[Cabal (Namor's) (Earth-616)|Cabal]] and told Magneto about the Incursions because he believed that Magneto would do whatever possible to stop them.

Magneto contacted his daughter Polaris to help him deal with the Incursions. In a move that stunned Polaris, he stole his daughter's powers in order to be strong enough to push the [[Earth-1610|other world]] away during the final Incursion. However, Magneto's attempt failed and, losing control of the immense forces at work, he simply disintegrated.{{r|Magneto Vol 3 18|21}} The Incursion wasn't stopped in the end, causing the two worlds to collide and destroy the universe.{{r|Secret Wars #1}}

===Uncanny X-Men===
When the universe was restored to life, so was Magneto and all of its inhabitants, with no memories of their temporary demise. During the [[M-Pox]] crisis, Magneto became despondent. With the rage that had always driven him failing him, Magneto roamed the wilderness, desperately searching for a reason to fight. He found that reason when [[Warren Worthington III (Clone) (Earth-616)|Archangel]] suddenly fell from the sky. His last words before losing consciousness were "ensure mutants survive." Magneto, being reminded of his purpose, found reason to live again, and vowed to find others to stand at their side. He gathered a team of [[X-Men (Magneto's) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] willing to do whatever necessary to ensure the survival of the mutant species.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 7}}

After facing several challenges, Magneto's enterprise eventually fell apart, with his allies gradually going their own paths. Following a [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|a war between X-Men and Inhumans]], during which Magneto worked with Emma Frost in secret, Psylocke, the first defector of his team, came back to Erik in order to kill him, having vowed to put an end to him if he ever did something that she considered could lead mutantkind down a dark path. She succeeded in the mission and left Erik for dead in the [[Savage Land]]. However, he was found by Exodus and brought back to life by [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 19}}

===Mentoring the Time-Displaced X-Men===
Presumed dead, Magneto approached [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] and convinced her to work in secret with him alongside [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|the other time-displaced X-Men]] to publicly stand against any threat to Xavier's dream of coexistence between humans and mutants.{{r|X-Men: Blue #1|2}} At his new headquarters on the island nation of [[Madripoor]], Magneto was approached by a [[Cosmic Cube]]-altered [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America]] who offered him a sovereign, independent country for mutants in the form of Hydra's takeover of the [[United States of America]]. Magneto was also given the decapitated head of the Red Skull as a token of Rogers' sincerity, leading him to ultimately accept the offer, even if he acknowledged it represented making a deal with the devil. Steve admitted Hydra would eventually go to war against [[New Tian]] as soon as their reign settled in the rest of the States.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #17}} While still hiding in Madripoor, Magneto ensured the X-Men under his wings helped keep peace in New Tian.{{r|X-Men: Blue #7|9}}

New Tian eventually entered into conflict with Hydra after Emma Frost secured a fragment of a Cosmic Cube desired by Hydra to use it as leverage.{{r|Captain America Vol 8 25}} When Frost attempted to re-negotiate with Hydra and Rogers refused,{{r|Secret Empire #8}} Magneto retaliated by launching a full-on assault on Hydra's forces, which unwittingly helped the efforts of the rebellious group known as the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]] to put an end to Hydra's reign.{{r|Secret Empire #9}}

Magneto faced a challenge in a global scale in the form of a cabal formed by Emma Frost, Havok, Bastion, and [[Claudine Renko (Earth-616)|Miss Sinister]], who intended to artificially make mutants the dominant species using a power-bestowing virus named [[Mothervine]].{{r|X-Men: Blue #23}} With most of the young X-Men temporarily lost in space as a consequence of an adventure involving the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]],{{r|X-Men: Blue Annual #1}}{{r|X-Men: Blue #21}}{{r|Venom #162}}{{r|X-Men: Blue #22}}{{r|Venom #163}} Magneto's resources were stretched thin. Fortunately, Magneto's allies, led by Polaris, rallied together to form a patchwork team of X-Men.{{r|X-Men: Blue #25}} When Mothervine was released, Magneto saw his hand forced when he had to kill a group of mutants under Miss Sinister's control in self-defense.{{r|X-Men: Blue #27}} This incident pushed Magneto to his emotional brink and, after Mothervine was neutralized,{{r|X-Men: Blue #28}} he vowed to once again advance his mutant agenda by any means necessary.{{r|X-Men: Blue #30}} Magneto left the young X-Men behind, and set up a new Asteroid M, where he founded a new incarnation of the Brotherhood.{{r|X-Men: Blue #34}}

===[[Age of X-Man (Event)|Age of X-Man]]===
In the reality created by [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]] and a [[Life Seed]], a world where everyone on Earth was a mutant and relationships were strongly discouraged, Magneto was a member of that reality's X-Men team.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}} He lived alone, but in the same housing development as the rest of the team.{{r|Age of X-Man: The Marvelous X-Men Vol 1 1}} Magneto and the rest of the X-Men were the primary response team to all matter of worldwide threats and danger, including wildfires and the protection of mutant incubation facilities.{{r|Age of X-Man: The Marvelous X-Men Vol 1 1}}

The team soon came into conflict with Murshid En Sabah Nur and his [[X-Tracts (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|X-Tracts]] team, revolutionaries who endorsed love, relationships, and community over the state-endorsed "identity, harmony, autonomy". The X-Men were forced to battle and quell the riled crowd around the X-Tracts, with Magneto, Storm, and [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] experiencing memory flashes from their home reality.{{r|Age of X-Man: The Marvelous X-Men Vol 1 2}} Magneto experienced additional flashes, this time of those he erroneously believed to be his deceased children, [[Wanda Maximoff (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] and [[Pietro Maximoff (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], through a fissure in the wall of his house. Unbeknownst to him, Storm witnessed the fissure's images and Magneto's emotional breakdown.{{r|Age of X-Man: The Marvelous X-Men Vol 1 2}}

After a rescue relief mission in the Bahamas, Storm confronted Magneto at home about what they had seen. Needing telepathic privacy, the two of them moved their conversation into the eye of a storm, discussing their memories and experiences around The Resolution (event which gave all humanity mutant powers). Neither could agreed what to do about the situation. X-Man interrupted them soon after, bringing them to another fissure in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. The fissure's images further confirmed the illusion of the current reality, stoking Magneto and Storm's anger and leading them to attack Nate for his deception. With a wave of his hand, though, he banished them back to their homes and erased their memories.{{r|Age of X-Man: The Marvelous X-Men Vol 1 3}}

Magneto and the rest of the X-Men were present on Xavier Day a few days later, offering crowd control support. After the celebration went sideways after the arrival of the X-Tracts, Jean was forced to use her telepathy to disperse the crowd, Magneto at her side.{{r|Age of X-Man: The Marvelous X-Men Vol 1 4}}

Magneto, Storm, X-23, Nightcrawler, and Nature Girl assembled sometime later with Psylocke to investigate the murder scene of [[Moneta (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Moneta]]. Magneto prevailed the group to keep their discovery an internal matter and process through the information in a logical fashion before confronting Nate.{{r|Age of X-Man: The Marvelous X-Men Vol 1 5}}

===House of X===
[[File:Max_Eisenhardt_(Earth-616)_from_House_of_X_Vol_1_1_001_(1).png|thumb|Magneto welcoming the ambassadors]][[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Xavier]] returned and decided to use Krakoa in order to establish a new sovereign Mutant nation state. 

Magneto, [[Esme Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Esme]] and [[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie Cuckoo]] welcomed a delegation of international ambassadors and representatives to give them a quick tour of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] (showing them the new [[Jerusalem Habitat]]) while setting the terms of the new mutant state and its relationship to humanity.{{r|House of X #1}} Meanwhile, Professor Xavier sent Sabretooth, Mystique, and Toad to steal data from [[Damage Control (Earth-616)|Damage Control]], but Sabretooth was apprehended by the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] while Mystique and Toad got away.{{r|House of X #1}} With this new data, Xavier and Magneto learned the existence of the [[Orchis Forge]] (a space station located near the sun), where the humans created a new [[Mother Mold (Earth-616)|Mother Mold]] and were about to activate it. More importantly, Xavier and Magneto believed it would be there that [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] would become operational. The duo then tasked Cyclops with assembling a team to destroy the Mother Mold and prevent the creation of Nimrod.{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 2}}

When Cyclops was able to assemble a team, he informed Xavier and Magneto. The team was composed of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]], [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]], [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet St. Croix]], [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]], [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 3}} They embarked on the mission to deactivate The Mother Mold and sustained heavy casualties. Thought the team succeeded in their mission, it cost them their lives.{{r|House of X Vol 1 4}}

[[File:Charles Xavier (Earth-616) and Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from House of X Vol 1 6 001.jpg|thumb|left|Magneto and Xavier]]
Along with his daughter, [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], Magneto witnessed the resurrection of the mutants who were killed during the attack on the Mother Mold. He explained to Polaris how the [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]] created the process of resurrection.

Magneto, along with Xavier and Wolverine, were present when a number of mutants formerly hostile to the X-Men and humanity arrived, led by [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]], who revealed that he has had a history with The island of Krakoa. When Magneto asked Apocalypse to submit to all the laws of Krakoa and work in service of mutantkind, Apocalypse agreed.{{r|House of X #5}}

Magneto was present in the first meeting of the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council of Krakoa]] where they drafted the initial rules of Krakoa and determined the fate of mutant criminal [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]].{{r|House of X #6}}

===Hellfire Gala===
After the events of [[X of Swords|the tournament]] against [[Amenth]] and Krakoa's victory, the island of [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]], Krakoa's twin half and home to millions of mutants, was stranded on Earth, next to Krakoa. Xavier and Magneto met with [[Isca (Earth-616)|Isca the Unbeaten]], one of the leaders of the Arakki mutants to discuss how their mutant societies might co-exist. The prospects of finding common ground with the war-like Arakki, who far outnumbered the Krakoans, seemed slim, prompting Magneto to propose a solution; he would gather a group of omega level mutants to terraform [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]], which would become the capital of the solar system and a new home to Arakko, giving mutantkind an advantage over humanity in negotiations with alien civilisations, and solving the incompatibility of the Arakki with Earth.

Magneto and his omegas, recruited both from Krakoan and Arakki mutants, succeeded in terraforming the planet and moving the island of Arakko. This was unveiled at the [[Hellfire Gala]], a grand party for both mutants and their human allies and enemies. After the gala, Magneto invited [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Wanda Maximoff]] to a private meeting. He told her that no matter what had happened before, he would always be her father. The two shared a loving embrace, but shortly after their meeting, Wanda was murdered. Magneto angrily demanded that the Council resurrect her, since despite the fact that she wasn't a mutant there was a back-up of her. The Council refused however, prompting Magneto to lash out and attack Xavier. [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] found in their investigation that Wanda had been choked to death by a supernaturally manipulated metallic object, making Magneto the lead suspect. A team composed of X-Factor, X-Force and the X-Men showed up to arrest Magneto, who refused to come along peacefully and instead attacked them. The resulting battle was ended by Quicksilver, who appeared and beat Magneto within an inch of his life, leaving him comatose.{{r|X-Men: The Trial of Magneto #1}}

Magneto was awoken from his coma by [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], who told him to make sure the visiting Avengers did not see Wanda's body. Magneto attacked the Avengers, and tried to force them to leave by capturing [[Kyle Jinadu (Earth-616)|Kyle Jinadu]]. When the Avengers stood their ground, he confessed to Wanda's murder and told them to take him away, only to be interrupted by [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Wanda]], who had suddenly reappeared.{{r|X-Men: The Trial of Magneto #2}}

The new Wanda quickly showed incomplete memories as she believed she and Vision were still married, didn't recognize her kids and still believed Magneto to be her father. Jean Grey and [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]] decided they needed to restore her memories but they started with all the worst ones and it caused Wanda to have a panic attack. At this point three kaiju's came out of nowhere and attacked the island. The X-Men, Avengers and X-Factor went to deal with this threat with [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]] threatening him on the way if he ever attacked his husband again.{{r|X-Men: The Trial of Magneto #3}}

===Inferno===
Xavier and Magneto visited Moira in [[Moira's No-Space|No-Space]] to discuss recent events such as their recent attempts to destroy [[Orchis (Earth-616)|Orchis]], some odd uses of the gates leading to [[Muir Island]] they believed were Moira, and the fact that Mystique was still expecting them to resurrect [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny]]. They concluded that Mystique would want to seek revenge on Krakoa and agreed she could no longer be on the Quiet Council, the next day they tried to convince the council to vote to remove her but before they could she hijacked the meeting and revealed she had Destiny resurrected behind their backs and nominated her to fill one of the vacant seat in the council, left by Apocalypse.{{r|Inferno Vol 2 1}} Having already gotten to most of the council Mystique easily got Destiny voted in, foiling their plan to remove her, defeated Xavier called the meeting off early. Realizing Mystique and Destiny were close to destroying everything they'd built, and unwilling to solve the problem by breaking Krakoa's laws, he, Charles, and Moira decided they needed to bring another council member in on their secret plans and it needed to be someone they could trust who understood the gravity of the situation. They decided on [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] so they invited her to a meeting at [[Louvre Museum|The Louvre]] where Moira revealed herself to still be alive to Emma. They had Emma read Moira's mind so she knew exactly what was happening but upon doing so she was so disgusted that three of them had been lying to everyone the whole time that she left without hearing them out. The next day they decided to put [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] on the council in [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean]]'s place, Emma voted with them indicating they have her support.{{r|Inferno Vol 2 2}}

| Powers                  = Magneto was previously thought of being an '''Alpha-level [[Homo superior|mutant]]''',{{r|X-Men Vol 2 97}} but has been recently confirmed to be '''[[Omega Level Mutant|Omega Level]]'''.{{r|House of X #1}} He has been stated on several occasions to have been one of the most powerful mutants,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #392}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 112}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 113}}{{r|X-Men: Prelude to Schism #3}} he has also been described for several times as the most powerful mutant,{{r|The Official Marvel Index to the X-Men #6}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #368}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 110}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 112}} Earth's most powerful super villain,{{r|X-Men #1}}{{r|X-Men #4}} even the single most powerful being on the face of the Earth.{{r|X-Men Unlimited #2}} He possesses tremendous amounts of power, which is, for all practical purposes, limitless.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: X-Men 2005 Vol 1 1}} The upper limits of Magneto's power can't be surpassed in any measurable fashion.{{r|House of X #1}}

After the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|conflict between the Avengers and the X-Men]], Magneto's abilities were greatly reduced.{{r|All-New X-Men #3}}{{r|Magneto Vol 3 1}} Additionally, the prolonged use of his powers takes a physical toll on him.{{r|Magneto Vol 3 6}} Using an extremely-refined [[Mutant Growth Hormone|MGH]],{{r|Magneto Vol 3 9}} he has been able to reach his former levels{{r|Uncanny Avengers #25}} for a period of hours.{{r|Magneto Vol 3 12}}

While Magneto was operating with his own team of X-Men and later mentoring the time-displaced X-Men, his abilities remained damaged.[https://cullenbunn.tumblr.com/post/164280081354/hello-dear-mrbunn-is-magnetos-power-still]
After an unspecified amount of time, his abilities have appeared to return to their previous levels of power.{{r|X-Men: Black - Magneto #1}}

[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 521 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|The Master of Magnetism]]
'''Magnetokinesis:''' Magneto has comprehensive control over all forms of magnetism and utilizes that control to manipulate any metal and achieve a variety of effects.{{r|X-Men: Earth's Mutant Heroes #1}} He recently proved able to effectively hold together the headless form of a [[Celestial]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 2}} Magneto can manipulate an entire planet's electromagnetic field and once even pulled back the giant metallic 'bullet' where Kitty Pryde was trapped inside, which was at least a few light-years away from Earth,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #521}} though these are tasks that require great effort on his part. Magneto's power is comparable with Phoenix's,{{r|Classic X-Men #18}} he has harnessed magnetism to stop armies, raise islands from ocean floors, move mountains, change the course of rivers, and threaten to devastate the world with floods and earthquakes. Magneto once blanketed the entire globe with a self-generated electromagnetic pulse that caused widespread devastation. Moreover, he can use his magnetic powers in more than one way simultaneously. He can completely assemble a complicated machine within seconds through his powers. It is unclear whether Magneto's power is psionic or purely physiological in nature.
* '''Magnetic Force-Fields:''' Magneto usually protects himself with a personal force field that he can quickly expand to protect large areas. His force field has withstood the effects of multiple nuclear weapons, volcanic eruptions, the depths of space, and attacks from multiple [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] or [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|X-Men #113}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 25}} It has protected him against plasma attacks which were hotter than the sun.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #5.1}} It also remained intact after being attacked by Ghost Rider and [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)]].{{r|Champions #16}}{{citation}}{{Verify source}} It has even protected Magneto from a blast from Phoenix Force Jean Grey. Magneto can also use his force fields to hit or trap an enemy, and also levitate objects and beings in the air.
* '''Magnetic Armor:''' In addition to the obvious external force fields, Magneto can reinforce the metallic fibers of his uniform with magnetic fields, making his clothing like armor with a durability approaching adamantium.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 2}} With this ability, he can resist punches from opponents such as Namor or Colossus and remain conscious.{{r|X-Men #113}}{{r|New Mutants #40}}
* '''Magnetic Rays:''' Magneto has the ability to shoot powerful rays and electromagnetic pulses, and has shown this ability to destroy both metallic and nonmetallic objects. Magneto can also use this ability to seriously injure his enemies as he did with [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #150}} He also one-shotted Iron Man, destroyed a mountain, and cracked Holocaust's armor
* '''Magnetic Flight:''' Magneto is capable of sustaining flight for very long distances and at varying speeds. Apocalypse, through attempting to replicate Magneto's power in Mystique, mentions Magneto interfaces with magnetic field lines in his immediate surroundings rather than along it. This was later confirmed by Beast and later Sinister who formed a temporary alliance to snap Mystique out of Apocalypse's influence. However, in order to travel in space, Magneto requires and is limited by the interior capacity of his force field to breathe.
* '''Geomagnetic Link:''' Magneto's X-gene plays an important role in mediating tactile perception to Earth's electromagnetic field. This trait remained even when rendered temporarily powerless by Lilandra. As it is affected, so is he. He knows instinctively all that happens to it.
* '''Gravity Reduction:''' Magneto's control over the magnetic and electromagnetic force is so refined that he can shut off gravity within a limited radius of himself by reversing the polarity of the earth's own magnetic field.
* '''Metal/Matter Manipulation:''' Magneto can perceive and manipulate matter at the sub-atomic level.{{r|Classic X-Men #18}} Magneto also demonstrated the ability to indirectly manipulate non-metallic objects via metal ores they may contain. Magneto is also capable of creating powerful electromagnetic fields capable of moving and manipulating nonmetallic objects, as well as levitating them (he can also do this via force fields). He can even perceive tachyons and a variety of antiparticles.{{r|Avengers Academy #22}}
** '''Metal Morphing:''' Magneto displayed the power to physically bond metallic substances to other elements at an atomic level. This newly developed technique allows Magneto to blend alloys to earthen, watery, gaseous and even organic substances. Using such a technique was how he could commandeer the techno-organic physiology of Omega Sentinel with such relative ease.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #464|465}}
* '''Organic Iron Manipulation:''' Magneto can control the traces of iron within organic matter and can manipulate the iron-enriched blood-flow to one's brain to potentially induce very limited effects. There are only 2.5 grams of iron in the bloodstream of a healthy human body and perhaps a gram at most in the rest of the body. As a reference, a penny weighs 2.5 grams. Magneto has used his magnetic abilities to extract the [[adamantium]] bonded to [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s skeletal structure.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 25}}
* '''Electromagnetic Sight:''' By concentrating, Magneto can perceive the world around himself as patterns of magnetic and electrical energy. He can perceive the natural electromagnetic auras given off by living beings.
* '''Electromagnetic Spectrum Manipulation:''' Although Magneto's primary power is magnetism, he can also project or manipulate any form of energy within the electromagnetic spectrum, though this is extremely tiring for him, so he primarily sticks to magnetism. He can potentially shoot and absorb forms of electromagnetic radiation or energy, create intense heat as infrared radiation, and become invisible by deflecting visible light around his body. The electromagnetic spectrum includes visible light, radio waves, ultraviolet light, gamma rays, and x-rays -- Magneto can project any of these to some extent, though doing so would dramatically tire him.
** '''Electrokinesis:''' Magneto is capable of generating and projecting powerful bolts of electricity, due to his manipulation over the electromagnetic spectrum. He is capable of absorbing bolts of lightning and projecting an electric aura around himself.
** '''Wormhole Creation:''' Through an as of yet unknown application of his powers, Erik can open wormholes between two points in space and time in order to traverse the most impassible of distances almost instantly.{{r|Excalibur Vol 3 8}}
** '''Photokinesis:''' Erik can manipulate, generate and redirect various fields of light as easily as he can bend metal to his will. Becoming invisible by bending it around himself,{{r|Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol 1 #4}} turning Dazzlers' own luminary based powers against her,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 393}} creating holographic projections cast from over a world away and change laser trajectory.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 #6}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #150}}{{r|Magneto Vol 3 #21}}

'''Astral Projection (possibly formerly):''' Magneto has occasionally been said to be able to manifest an astral projection of himself.{{r|X-Men #6}}{{r|X-Men The Hidden Years #4}} ''However, like all formerly attributed psychic powers, this has been retconned out of existence at least once,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #150}} and hasn't been used by Magneto since the "Silver Age" (chronologically speaking).''

'''Telepathic Resistance:''' Magneto has trained himself extensively for fighting telepaths, and is resistant to telepathic attack, even when unconscious.{{r|X-Men: The Trial of Magneto Vol 1 2}} This training is similar to that given to the X-Men and New Mutants by Professor X, although the effects are further augmented with the aid of his helmet (see below), his strong will, and his own electromagnetic powers.

| Abilities               = [[Image:Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616) from Classic X-Men Vol 1 19 0001.jpg|thumb]]
'''[[Genius Intelligence]]:''' A mastermind, Magneto is a genius in various scientific fields. He is an expert in genetic engineering and mutation. He has created artificial living beings, mutated humans in order to give them superhuman powers, instilled genetic mind-control, created adult clones of human beings, and manipulated the genetic structures of those clones during their development. His discoveries in particle physics would revolutionize the field and place him among the giants of scientific history if they were to be revealed. He has designed magnetically-powered aircraft and spacecraft, space stations, an underground complex said to be a masterpiece of automated technology that would do [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] or [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] proud, complex robots and computers, magnetically-powered generators, and machines capable of nullifying mutant powers within a radius of several miles.{{r|X-Men: Earth's Mutant Heroes #1}}

'''[[Skilled Combatant]]:''' With several decades of fighting experience, Magneto is a skilled fighter. By increasing his physical stats with his powers, he can hold his own against Iron Man and defeat several men unarmed. 

'''[[Multilingual]]:''' Magneto is fluent in English, Arabic, French,{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 12}} German,{{r|X-Men: Magneto Testament #1}} Hebrew, Polish, Russian,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 150}} Ukrainian,{{r|Magneto #0}}{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 12}} and Yiddish.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #522|The (Yiddish) words used are a bit unclear, but this is most likely a minor mistake by the writer.}}

'''Indomitable Will:''' Magneto will strive to complete his tasks, no matter what it takes.
| Strength                = 
| Weaknesses              = '''Physical Condition:''' Magneto's ability to wield his superhuman powers effectively is dependent upon his physical condition. When severely injured, his body is unable to withstand the strain of manipulating magnetic energy. When his powers are not at their peak, he also appears to have greater difficulty utilizing his magnetism for great feats. He is also susceptible to physical and mental fatigue that can ultimately affect his ability to adequately use his powers, especially if he overuses or extends them in a short amount of time.

{{Navigation 
| title = Former Weaknesses
| body  = Magneto lost his control over his power after [[Dark Beast]] infected him with nanotech Sentinels, which was previously thought to be the cause of his exposure to the Phoenix Force.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 22}} He wasn't able to focus his powers well enough for fine control without suffering from painful backlash; simply restructuring guns into harpoons caused him physical and mental trauma.
}}

| Equipment               = [[File:X-Men The End Vol 3 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Magneto's Helmet]]
{{Seealso|:Category:Magneto's Equipment}}
'''[[Magneto's Helmet]]:''' Magneto's helmet is built to shield his mind from psychic probes and manipulation.

'''Armor:''' The costume that Magneto wears is a type of armor that he has created through the use of his magnetic powers. The costume is actually an amalgam of various lightweight but highly durable metallic alloys that further protect him from physical injury. He can also use different metals surrounding him to enhance his armor, making it as strong as [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]'s [[Iron Man Armor]].{{r|AVX: Vs #1}}
| Transportation          = He is capable of flying under his own power (which he tends to do most of the time); also [[X-Men Blackbird]], [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]], formerly various exotic aerial vehicles.
| Weapons                 = Magneto relies primarily on his natural powers, although he has occasionally used magnetically-powered devices he invented, such as his machine for inducing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions from afar. Magneto used to employ mechanisms for magnifying his own powers, but since his rejuvenation, he no longer needs them.

| Notes                   = * Magneto's magnetism is so strong that he was able to bend the [[adamantium]] in [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s skeleton and remove it from his body.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 25}}
* Magneto has a propensity for mental illness and depression. Magneto has suffered repeated episodes of mental illness, mental breakdowns, and mania. These literal "bipolar" tendencies were once diagnosed by Moira MacTaggert as possibly being a natural side effect of his powers, which she tried to correct him of when he was reduced to an infant in her care.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 2}}
* Despite being a teenager during the Holocaust, due to being de-aged to a baby and re-aged to his prime as well as later rejuvenated by the High Evolutionary, Magneto has the body of a man in his prime.{{r|Defenders #16}}{{r|X-Men #104}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #511}}
| Trivia                  = * After Magneto was believed dead in the Genoshan holocaust, he became a popular t-shirt logo and graffiti image.{{Citation}} (Refer to the "Magneto Was Right" image above.)
* The DC Comics super-villain [[w:c:DC:Hans Leckter (New Earth)|Doctor Diehard]] of The [[w:c:DC:Extremists (New Earth)|Extremists]] is based on Magneto.{{Citation}}
* A [[Jack Kirby|Jack Kirby]] close up image of Magneto's face was used as source material for Roy Lichtenstein's ''Image Duplicator'' (1963).{{Citation}}
* While Magneto is Jewish, he maintained a cover identity as a 'Sinte Gypsy' when searching for his wife Magda. This created confusion amongst some readers as to his heritage,<ref name="RA">[http://www.adherents.com/lit/comics/Magneto.html ''The Religious Affiliation of Comic Book Character Erik Magnus Lehnsherr &ndash; Magneto'']. URL last checked 2007-09-12.</ref> until it was authoritatively confirmed that he is Jewish.{{r|X-Men: Magneto Testament #1}}<ref name="Protocols">[http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/masters/113040741184291.htm ''Protocols of the Elders of Marvel'']</ref><ref name="Joe Fridays">, [http://www.newsarama.com/NewJoeFridays/NewJoeFridays28.html ''New Joe Fridays Week 28'']</ref> It should be noted that this confusion probably stems from a comic book published in the early 1990s which attempted to retcon Magneto into being a Sinti, possibly because Marvel was preparing to make Magneto a deadly villain again in the crossover called "Fatal Attractions" and they did not want to draw accusations of anti-Semitism by having one of their main villains be Jewish. This attempted retcon was corrected a few years later when it was revealed that the name "Erik Lehnsherr" and the Sinte ethnicity were part of a cover identity, as mentioned above.
* Magneto's redemption was chronicled in the pages of New Mutants. {{cl|Uncanny X-Men #150}} is the first issue to start developing Magneto's origin as a prisoner of Auschwitz and his marriage to Magda.
* Magneto's Auschwitz tattoo was originally seen as 214782 in {{cl|Uncanny X-Men #161}}. However, this was a number too high for him to have been among the first group of prisoners to be tattooed there. The number was retconned in {{cl|Excalibur Vol 3 2}} to 24005, but appeared again as 214782 in {{cl|X-Men: Black - Magneto Vol 1 1}}.
* "Eisenhardt", or rather "eisenhart" means "hard as iron", a convenient name for the Master of Magnetism. It can be pronounced as "ice 'n' heart".
* Magneto's pseudonym "Lehnsherr" is often pronounced incorrectly as "Lanshir". Actually the name is composed of two German words: "Leh(e)n" meaning "feud" and "Herr" meaning "master" in that instance. In German 's' is a connective between two combined words sometimes. It could be pronounced as "lens hair" ("e" like in "help" but longer).<ref>http://erik-charles.livejournal.com/946239.html</ref> It's the German word for "liege lord".
* Magneto was ranked 1st on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Villains in 2011.{{Citation}}
* The album ''Venus and Mars'' by Wings included a song about superheroes called "Magneto and Titanium Man". Paul McCartney was said to have toured the Marvel offices soon after the album came out in the Bullpen Bulletins and it was claimed that he was a fan of Marvel Comics. The song referenced the names of two other Marvel villains ([[Titanium Man]] and the [[Crimson Dynamo]]). Another song to feature Magneto is the Tearjerkers' "Comic Book Heroes" from the various artists' compilation ''Through the Back Door'', in which some of the lyrics were "[[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doc Ock]], [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Von Doom]] and Magneto, don't wanna be like them."
* "Magneto" was a song by the post-hardcore band ''Brigade'', fronted by Charlie Simpson's brother Will.{{Citation}}
* Magneto carries an archive containing an hologram with the names of numerous mutants violently killed.{{r|Magneto Vol 3 4}} 
* After his encounter with the Phoenix, his powers now more closely resemble the powers of his [[Erik Lehnsherr (Earth-10005)|movie counterpart]] who is only able to manipulate strictly metallic objects.{{Citation}}
* For much of the original appearance of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], its members kept referring to him as "the Leader", instead of calling him Magneto.{{r|X-Men #4}} 
* Magneto tried to explain to the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] that their personal feelings (and the mutual dislike between team members) are meaningless. In his view, only their plans were important.{{r|X-Men #4}} However, Magneto himself had trouble controlling his anger.{{r|X-Men #4}}
* The Toad's flattery to Magneto included proclamations that Magneto was born to rule.{{r|X-Men #4}}
* While Toad loudly proclaimed his loyalty to Magneto, Magneto found him annoying. He threatened Toad to remain silent.{{r|X-Men #5}}
* In an early battle between the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, the X-Men captured the Toad and the Brotherhood captured the [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]]. Magneto expressed his belief that their hostage was more valuable than the "high-jumping fool", and was ready to abandon the Toad.{{r|X-Men #5}}
* Magneto has claimed to be able to sense the greed and envy of a man's heart, even when meeting this man for the first time. He finds it easy to manipulate others through these qualities.{{r|X-Men #6}}
* To secure victory over the X-Men, Magneto was willing to sacrifice [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]]'s life in a deadly attack on them. He threatened to kill the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] as well, for defying his orders.{{r|X-Men #6}}
* While listening to another proclamation of loyalty by the Toad, Magneto contemplated that he did not actually need the loyalty of his followers. He expected to rule over them by using their fear for him. He chose to not share his thought with the other members of the Brotherhood.{{r|X-Men #6}}
*According to [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Mastermind]], Magneto has no emotions and no heart.{{r|X-Men #7}}
