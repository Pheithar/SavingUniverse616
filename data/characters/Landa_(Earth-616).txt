| History                 = Landa is an alien who lives on an unidentified world that exists in the [[Inniverse]], a dimension that exists parallel to Earth's that is located by breaching the proper occupational frequency to allow passage between the distances between atoms and molecules that comprise of matter. She eventually married [[Occulus (Earth-616)|Occulus]], the most powerful ruler of the Gem Guild, who beaome a ruler of his world, he saved the people of their world but later became a tyrant. Occulus' rule was tempered between his adviser [[Dangor (Earth-616)|Dangor]] and his wife. {{r|Fantastic Four #364}} During one of his wife's protests, Occulus used his power to sear off her left hand. {{r|Fantastic Four #365}}

The twin brother of Occulus was [[Wildblood (Earth-616)|Wildblood]], a leader of a band of rebels constantly stealing gems from Occulus. After one such theft, Wildblood witnessed as the hand belonging to the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four's]] [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] breached the barrier between worlds. When he was later found by the Gem Guild, he saw the hand pierce their realm again and used it to escape to Earth. There Wildblood battled it out with members of the Fantastic Four and was incapacitated. However, members of the Gem Guild followed Wildblood to Earth, and discovering that Mister Fantastic and the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman's]] son [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin]] was Gem-Talented, captured him, the Invisible Woman and Wildblood before returning to their own dimension. {{r|Fantastic Four #362}} Wildblood, Sue, and Franklin were brought before Occulus and it was here that Dangor revealed to his leader that the Richards child was an even more powerful adept at commanding the power of the gems. Although Occulus saw the boy as a threat, Landa tried to convince Occulus to spare the child out of compassion. Dangor convinced his master to use the boy as a matrix to utilize the power of all the gems on their world. As Sue and Wildblood escaped captivity, the matrix was constructed. Sue came back for her son alone, battling against Occulus and almost won had it not been for Dangor threatening to slit her child's throat. This allowed Occulus to defeat her and activate the machine. {{R|Fantastic Four #363}}

Ultimately, the rest of the Fantastic Four arrived with Wildblood and his rebels and attacked Occulus. During this battle, [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] attempted to overload Occulus with his Gemenervator device, but Occulus managed to destroy it before it could finish it's task, gaining absolute power. {{r|Fantastic Four #364}} Consumed with power, Occulus lashed out against his foes as well as his own people. Having failed to appeal to her husband's long lost humanity Landa betrayed her husband to help the Fantastic Four defeat him. Utilizing the matrix device Occulus had created, Reed refitted it to emit a negative charge that send Occulus rapidly flying out of orbit and into space. {{r|Fantastic Four #365}}

The subsequent fate of Landa is unknown at this time.
