===Origin===
Gabriel Cohuelo grew up in the home of his wealthy parents in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]]. As he was preparing to complete his high school education and move away to a university, his [[Homo superior|mutant]] powers activated.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #527}} He was located by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] using [[Cerebra]].{{r|X-Men: Second Coming #2}} The X-Men sent [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] and [[Cecilia Reyes (Earth-616)|Dr. Cecilia Reyes]] to investigate. Gabriel was moving at such a fast rate that he could not even be seen by the naked eye, although Psylocke was still able to telepathically sense his presence.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #527}}

After saving [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Laurie]], [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], and the others headed to Mexico City. Once there, Hope was able to stabilize Gabriel's power similar to how she stabilized Laurie's powers. Like Laurie, Gabriel was shocked by the manifestation of his mutant powers and was completely willing to follow Hope.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #527}}

===The Five Lights===
Gabriel joined Hope as she continued to rescue the other Lights. They team traveled to [[Nigeria]] to save [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men #528}} then across [[Europe]] and finally to [[Florida (State)|Florida]] while tracking [[Teon Macik (Earth-616)|Teon]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #529}} Later the group traveled to [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] to stop [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Kenji]]'s rampage. Gabriel was the first to side with Hope in her decision to ignore [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]' orders, and assisted in saving Kenji. During the melee he was even able to save Hope when she fell.{{r|Generation Hope #1|4}}

Once the Lights arrived on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Doctor Nemesis]]' tests revealed that Gabriel was actually a time-manipulator ''not'' a [[Superhuman Speed|speedster]] as he assumed.{{r|Generation Hope #4}} Gabriel's crush on Hope continued to blossom, and Hope even initiated a ''"thank you for saving my life"'' kiss.{{r|Generation Hope #5}} Gabriel continued to be very enthusiastic about following Hope and becoming a superhero.{{r|Generation Hope #5}} 

While still settling into life on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], and experimenting with their powers, the Lights were called to their first mission: investigating a new mutant manifestation in [[Berlin]].{{r|Generation Hope #6}} Gabriel in particular was excited for their first mission as a team. Although they encountered some setbacks, the team was able to pull together, convinced the [[Sixth Light (Earth-616)|''Sixth Light'']] to be born, stabilized his powers, and saved Berlin from his mind control.{{r|Generation Hope #7}}

When the team arrived back from [[Germany]], they were greeted by the news that the Macik's wanted their son [[Teon Macik (Earth-616)|Teon]] back. While awaiting the trial and in an effort to distract her team from the looming legal proceedings, Hope insisted on adopting codenames. Gabriel adopted the name "Velocidad", Spanish for speed.{{r|Generation Hope #8}}

After the events in Germany and Teon's trial, Gabriel and the team continued to train and prepare for more new mutant activations around the world. Thanks to the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] monitoring in [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]], Hope and the Lights were alerted almost immediately of the activation of the [[Zeeshan (Earth-616)|Seventh Light]]'s powers. They left quickly, but arrived just after Zee had committed suicide. The whole team took the death very hard.{{r|Generation Hope #9}}

===Regenesis===
After the events of Schism, Gabriel found his leg injured. He was visited by Pixie, who needed help with her pain pills. The two flirted and ended up making out. Hope walked in on them and was infuriated by Gabriel cheating on her; Pixie was no less angered, slapping him and calling him a tosser. Gabriel later confessed to Kenji that he knew his powers were making him age at a hyper-accelerated rate, and he wanted to live his life before it was gone. Pixie was convinced by Hope to join the team, and she also had Teon poop on Gabriel's bed.{{r|Generation Hope #12}}

Getting anxious to find a new mutant, Hope misinterpreted a light near the [[China|Chinese]] border of [[Pakistan]] as a new mutant manifestation. Hope assembled her team, but when they arrived they found an amnesiac [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]] strapped to a suicide bomb.{{r|Generation Hope #13}} The team narrowly escaped with Shaw from [[Jin Billion (Earth-616)|Jin Billion]] and his Butchers.{{r|Generation Hope #14}}

Shaw's return to Utopia caused high tensions. While [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma]] and Cyclops debated the fate of Shaw, several former [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] confronted the Lights. To end the feuding, Hope forcibly took control of and pushed Zero's powers to their limits without his permission and much to his disapproval.{{r|Generation Hope #15|#16}}

[[File:Lights (Earth-616) 003.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Lights after the death of Zero]]

While Hope studied the information about Shaw's past given to her by Cyclops, Zero began to finalize his plans to betray and murder Hope.{{r|Generation Hope #16}} For weeks Zero had been telepathically and subtly turning Utopians against Hope. As mind-controlled mutants converged on Hope, Gabriel and the remaining Lights came to her aid. The Lights fought off the other mutants as Hope and No-Girl combined their powers to kill Zero.{{r|Generation Hope #17}}

During a debriefing session, Shaw was fully inducted and the group reconciled some of the problems they had been facing.{{r|Generation Hope #17}}

===Avengers vs. X-Men===
When the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] arrived enforce on Utopia to take Hope into custody before the arrival of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]], Cyclops and the X-Men forcibly tried to stop them. During the melee, Hope escaped, but the Lights and young X-Men were left behind as Cyclops and many of his X-Men fled. Not wanting the younger X-Men to join the war, the Avengers decided to quarantine them at the [[Avengers Compound]] with the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]].{{r|Avengers Academy #29}} However, the teenage mutants didn't want to remain in custody, and were eventually allowed to leave.{{r|Avengers Academy #30|#31}} The Lights returned to Utopia in search of Hope,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 #13}} but when they couldn't find her they joined the other young mutants in [[Westchester County|Westchester]] at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School For Higher Learning]].{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men #15}}

The Lights were functionally disbanded with the departure of Hope and the enrolment of the remaining members into the Jean Grey School.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men #15}}

===Last X-Men and Death===
When most of the X-Men were killed on [[Quadra Island]], Gabriel joined the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] with a few other mutants.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 11}} Later, he was detained and forced to use his powers for [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]], which caused him to age rapidly. They merged him with [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]] to keep him alive while they continued to exploit his abilities. When [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] ultimately found him, Gabe asked him to kill him, so Logan mercifully ended his life.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 21}}

[[File:Gabriel Cohuelo (Earth-616) from Generation Hope Vol 1 4 001.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Gabriel discovering he is a time-manipulator, '''''NOT''''' a [[Superhuman Speed|speedster]]]]

Gabriel is one of post-[[Decimation|M-Day]] [[Homo superior|mutant]] activations. His powers include:
*'''Localized Time Manipulation:'''{{r|Generation Hope #4}} Gabriel can slow down the movement of time around him, but remains unaffected by the slow down. This gives Gabriel the appearance of moving very fast. Because of this phenomenon, it was originally thought Gabriel was a [[Superhuman Speed|speedster]]. When Gabriel first used his powers he appeared to be stuck in a state of superspeed, and unable to slow down, he aged by several months while only a day had passed for everybody else.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #527}} It has been revealed that his powers are speeding up his aging greatly{{r|Generation Hope #12}} and he already has gray hair.{{r|Generation Hope #13}}

That status of post-[[M-Day]] activated mutant gave him also the following characteristic:
*'''Lights Bonding:''' The Lights were shown to be linked to each other, to [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]] and to the new activations, with some low level control from Hope over them. They were also affected by the suicide of [[Zeeshan (Earth-616)|Zeeshan]].{{r|Generation Hope #9}} That situation was witnessed by [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Transonic]] and [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Zero]],{{r|Generation Hope #8}} and later by [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]].{{r|Generation Hope #12}} Also, when the [[Sixth Light (Earth-616)|Sixth Light]] activated, all of the Lights were able to sense it.{{r|Generation Hope #6}}

* Gabriel appears to have a romantic interest in [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]],{{r|Generation Hope #1|6}} and the feelings appear to be reciprocal,{{r|Generation Hope #6}} but after he kissed Pixie and Hope caught them, both girls turned him down.{{r|Generation Hope #12}} 
* Gabriel greatly dislikes being called ''"Speedy Gonzales"''.{{r|Generation Hope #4}}
| Trivia                  = * Gabriel was 16 according to himself{{r|Generation Hope #1}} and to [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Transonic]].{{r|Generation Hope #11}} It is unknown how old he really is considering the nature of his powers, but he appeared around eighteen during the rescue mission of [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Kenji]].{{r|Generation Hope #1}} 
* In the [[Multiverse|alternate]] [[Earth-11326|Age of X reality]], [[Gabriel Cohuelo (Earth-11326)|Gabriel]] took on the codename '''''Velocidad''''', before his mainstream version.{{r|Age of X: Universe #2}} "Velocidad" is Spanish, translating roughly to speed, rapidity, quickness, or fleetness and comes from the same Latin root as the English "velocity". With the choice of this codename, it would appear in this reality Gabriel also believed himself to be a [[Superhuman Speed|speedster]].
