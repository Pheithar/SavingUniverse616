| History                 = ===Origins===
Born Grigori Sovchenko, he was part Mongolian, likely on his mother's side, from the Russian Steppes. Back when relations were not so tense between the two bordering superpowers, [[Russia]] and [[China]], there were certain limited "exchange programs". Two of China's most accomplished Martial Artists, masters of the esoteric fighting style known as Naked Kill, were brought to Russia to teach and train a handpicked young. Do to his young Grigori's heritage, and since his father was a high ranking bureaucrat in the [[Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (Earth-616)|KGB]] infrastructure, he was chosen.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 110}}

His training occupied 15 years, at which time the two teachers were called home, but by then Grigori was already the single most dangerous man in Soviet Russia. He continued training on his own, refining and adding to the esoteric style with techniques and tricks of his own. When he judged himself to be truly ready and had passed his own self-appointed baptism, the undetected slaying of 10 top western spies with his bare hands, he assumed a new name. The Ghost Masker.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 110}}

===Perilous Reign===
Though a KGB operative, Ghost Maker went renegade with a smell faction of agents loyal to him. He planned to steal a new British weapon from a secret military base in [[Sussex]], codenamed Dragonfly Spire. This weapon could seed the clouds in such a way as to trigger an extremely corrosive acid rain. As such the weapon had been deemed too dangerous and unpredictable for use, and set for decommission.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 110}}

When a defected agent [[Mia Lessing (Earth-616)|Mia]], formerly Dark Angel from the Soviet joined [[MI6 (Earth-616)|MI6]], she told her new allies, [[Jack Tarr (Earth-616)|Black Tarr]], [[Clive Reston (Earth-616)|Sir Clive Reston]] and [[Denis Nayland Smith (Earth-616)|Smith]] of Ghost Maker, and his plans. Ghost Maker caught wind of this, moved up his plans and attacked that very night. Despite finding Black Tarr, Sir Clive Reston and [[Leiko Wu (Earth-616)|Leiko Wu]] there he pressed the attack under the over of darkness, and sleeping gas. But when he saw Â [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]], the chance to slay the legend and make him king of all the ghosts shaped by his hands was too great, so he attacked Shang-Chi.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 110}}

Though proving the better of the two, Ghost Maker remembered his original goal returned to the building. With the building falling apart to do with the battle between the soldiers and Ghost Makers men, he quickly got Wu out of the way and headed for the weapon. With Shang-Chi helping Black Tarr, who fall through the floor, Ghost Maker escaped with Wu holding on to his leg.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 110}}

====Deadly Rain====
Shang Chi saved Tarr from the burning spire and chased after Ghost Maker when he learned that the KGB operative was planning to kill the [[Elizabeth Windsor II (Earth-616)|Queen Elizabeth II]] of [[England]] with his new weapon. Shang Chi followed Ghost Maker in a jeep until his jetpack ran out of fuel. Ghost Maker found a motorcycle and headed for the [[English Channel]]. Ghost Maker overpowered Shang Chi on his jeep and took over. Ghost Maker managed to jump onto a ferry and Shang Chi followed him in a tugboat. The two martial artists engaged each other throughout the trip from the docks at [[Calais]], [[France]], on top of a moving train and even chased each other on bicycles until they reached [[Paris]] where the Queen was making an appearance. Ghost Maker abandoned his bike and ran to the top of a grassy knoll that overlooked the [[Eiffel Tower]].{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 111}}

Ghost Maker opened the canister and realized that it was punctured and most of the acid rain had leaked out. However, there was enough acid rain to seed one cloud but Shang Chi tackled his opponent before he could fire the gun. A fierce battle ensued but Ghost Maker severely damaged Shang Chi with a piece of barbwire and the assassin fired the launcher at a cloud drifting over the parade in Paris. The acid solution would react with the vapors of the cloud but the rain would not fall for some ten minutes so Shang Chi tried to defeat Ghost Maker as quickly as possible. The wind picked up during their fight and moved the acid cloud away from Paris and towards their location.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 111}}

A helicopter from the British authorities fly above the two combatants and Shang Chi gets on the ladder. Ghost Maker falls short when he tries to leap for the ladder as the helicopter ascended upwards. Ghost Maker tumbles down a hill and is showered by the acid rain. Shang Chi escapes and watches the Ghost Maker's gruesome death as his flesh melts off his bones.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 111}}

===Vendettas===
Years after his death, Ghost Maker was resurrected by the cult known as [[Snakeroot (Earth-616)|Snakeroot]] and was given a second chance to prove his worth to the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] by eliminating [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] and [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]]. He tracked down DareDevil in [[Manhattan#Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], [[Manhattan]], and attacked, though seemingly evenly matched the fight was interrupted by Elektra. Not ready to face them both, using his Jetpack, Ghost Maker quickly escaped. Taking Elektra's [[Elektra's Twin Sai|sai]] with him.

While at [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]] [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] wanted Shang-Chi to join [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and help bring in Elekta, which Shang-Chi was not interested. Until he saw that Ghost Maker had resurfaced when he was seen engaging Natchios. Shang Chi finds Ghost Maker on a building rooftop and they engage each other in unarmed combat. Ghost Maker is losing in hand-to-hand combat so he starts using weapons against Shang Chi and activates a hand held explosive device. Though hoping to kill Shang-Chi, he used the appearance of committing suicide escape defeat.{{r|Daredevil Annual Vol 1 10}}

[[Daito (Snakeroot) (Earth-616)|Lord Daito]] of the Hand warns Ghost Maker that his life can be easily taken back if he does not complete his sanction. Daito tells Ghost Maker that Daredevil is in the tunnels near one of their bases and to finish him once and for all. Ghost Maker engages Daredevil in combat and the fight becomes more intense when Shang Chi and Elektra enter the fray. During the fight, Ghost Maker stabs Shang Chi through the arm with Elektra's sai. Shang Chi pulls the sai out of his arm and throws it to Elektra. She retrieves her sai and impales Ghost Maker in the head causing him to turn into a pile of ashes.{{r|Daredevil Annual Vol 1 10}}

===Civil War===
Ghost Maker reappeared during the Civil War event and when the registration law was announced, he wanted to leave the country again. He contacted [[Vienna (Earth-616)|Vienna]] to make him a new fake identity, but he didn't know Vienna was secretly working for the [[Heroes for Hire (Knight & Wing) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]], who later apprehended Ghost Maker and several other supervillains. Shang-Chi was also part of this team although they did not interact.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 2 1}} Ghost Maker was then incarated in the [[Negative Zone]], [[Prison 42]].{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report Vol 1 1}}
