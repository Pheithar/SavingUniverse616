===Origins===
As a young child, Cassie suffered from a congenital heart defect. To save her life, her father, [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Scott Lang]], stole [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]]'s [[Ant-Man]] [[Ant-Man's Helmet|equipment]] and [[Pym Particles]], which he uses to rescue [[Erica Sondheim (Earth-616)|Doctor Sondheim]], the only doctor able to cure Cassie's condition, from [[Cross Technological Enterprises]].{{r|Marvel Premiere #47}}

[[File:Cassandra Lang (Earth-616) from Marvel Premiere Vol 1 47 0001.jpg|thumb|left|Cassie's childhood]]
As Cassie became older she wanted to become a hero just like her father. With Ant-Man for a dad, Cassie was able to encounter the world's greatest heroes on a frequent basis. Scott's time as an engineer for the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] brought Cassie to the team's then headquarters of [[Baxter Building|Four Freedom's Plaza]]. In the spectacular environment Cassie once called home, she forged a strong friendship with [[Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)|Kristoff Vernard]], the former ward of [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]. For the time they shared a home with the Fantastic Four, Cassie helped Kristoff adjust to life outside of Doom's castle, and she developed something of a crush on the boy.

When the Fantastic Four went missing and Scott found himself without a job, he found employment at Oracle, Inc. with the [[Heroes for Hire (Oracle Inc.) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]]. It was while working with the Heroes for Hire that Cassie had further adventures, accidentally activating the [[Adaptoid|Super-Adaptoid]], and receiving terrifying visions of things to come.{{r|Heroes for Hire #10}}  The H4H easily defeated the Adaptoid, and Cassie's participation in these dark events helped her father and his allies defeat the Master in a battle for the fate of the Earth itself.

After the divorce of her parents, Cassie's father joined the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. Cassie spent much of her time with her father living in [[Avengers Mansion]]. She loved and admired her father, and formed a strong relationship with his colleagues (she even referred to [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] as "''Uncle Tony''").{{r|I Am an Avenger #4}} Unbeknownst to anyone, Cassie used this time to secretly expose herself to [[Pym Particles]], in the hopes that she could be a superhero like her father.{{r|Young Avengers #3}}

However, when Cassie's mother [[Peggy Rae (Earth-616)|Peggy]] remarried, she and her new husband, [[Blake Burdick (Earth-616)|Blake Burdick]], continued to harbor a growing resentment towards superhuman heroes and worry for Cassie's safety. Peggy was able to obtain a court ruling limiting Scott's time with Cassie to supervised visits.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 62}}

Cassie went through a traumatic experience during this time, being kidnapped and held hostage with the looming threat of violence from a deranged individual hanging over her head. Scott arrived in time to save Cassie, and nearly took the life of the crazed man who had taken Cassie from her school. Her father's teammate [[Jonathan Hart (Earth-616)|Jack of Hearts]] had followed closely behind his fellow Avenger, unwilling to let Scott make a fatal mistake before Cassie's very eyes. Jack did the avenging for Scott and did so at the cost of his own life.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 76}}

===Death of Scott Lang===
Having felt responsible for Jack of Hearts' death, Scott ran out to greet his fallen comrade when he inexplicably landed on the [[Avengers Mansion]] grounds. Scott was then incinerated when Jack suddenly exploded, leaving some skeletal remains of Ant-Man in the newly formed crater. The Avengers lost a great deal during the coming hours, leading to the apparent end of the team itself. Cassie Lang was left without the love and support of her father. He was her parent, her inspiration, her hero and more. The man who had meant so much to her had died. Cassie was very saddened by her father's death, but as one hero would leave this world, another would take his place.{{r|Avengers #500}}{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #5}}

===Young Avengers===
After Scott's death, Cassie began living with her [[Peggy Rae Burdick (Earth-616)|mother]] and [[Blake Burdick (Earth-616)|step-father]]. Tensions were high, and Cassie constantly fought her mother. One night Cassie planned to leave home and join the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]].{{r|Young Avengers Special #1}} However, that same night Cassie learned about the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]].{{r|Young Avengers Special #1}} Intent on joining them, Cassie sought out [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Kate Bishop]], the young woman rescued by the Young Avengers. Together the pair went to the [[Avengers Mansion]] and found the four teen boys called [[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|Iron Lad]], [[Elijah Bradley (Earth-616)|Patriot]], [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]] and [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Asgardian]]. An argument soon erupted about Young Avengers membership, and Cassie began to grow at an alarming rate to everyone's surprise, including Cassie's.{{r|Young Avengers #2}} [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]] arrived to quell the argument and help Cassie.{{r|Young Avengers #3}}

While alone in the Avengers Mansion, Cassie confided to Tony that she had been secretly taking [[Pym Particles]] for years, and Tony told her the truth about her father's murder. Not long afterward, the Mansion was attacked by [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]].{{r|Young Avengers #3}} During the battle both Cassie and Kate joined in, and a brief romance sparked between Cassie and Iron Lad. After defeating Kang and saving the world, Cassie and Kate remained on as permanent members.{{r|Young Avengers #4|#5}}

[[File:Young Avengers (Earth-616) from Young Avengers Vol 1 6 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Stature with the Young Avengers]]
Captain America and Iron Man ordered the team to disband and refused to train them. However, Kate used some of her family's money and connections to procure a [[Bishop Publishing|new lair]], costumes and weapons for the team. Although codenames like "Ant-Girl" and "[[Titan]]" were suggested, Cassie adopted the title '''Stature'''.{{r|{{cl|Young Avengers Vol 1 5}}-[[Young Avengers Vol 1 #6|#6]]}}

After deciding to continue her life as a superhero, Cassie's stepfather and mother began to suspect that she is secretly Stature. Later, Jessica Jones confirmed Cassie's dual identity to her mother in an effort to stop the Young Avengers.{{r|{{cl|Young Avengers Vol 1 7}}-[[Young Avengers Vol 1 #8|#8]]}} Despite her mother and stepfather's objections, Cassie remained with the Young Avengers helping to avert a new [[Kree-Skrull War]], rescue [[Thomas Shepherd (Earth-616)|Speed]] and battle the [[Zodiac (U.N.) (Earth-616)|Zodiac]].{{r|Young Avengers #9|#12}}{{r|Young Avengers Presents #5}}

===[[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]]===
During the [[Civil War (Event)|Superhero Civil War]], Cassie originally sided with the other Young Avengers in rebelling against the [[Superhuman Registration Act|Registration Act]].{{r|Civil War #2}} When [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Goliath]] was killed by a [[Thor (Clone) (Earth-616)|clone of Thor]] and her teammate [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] captured by Iron Man, Cassie decided to leave Captain America's side. She cited her reasons as being a "desire to fight villains rather than cops and other heroes".{{r|Civil War #4}}

[[File:Cassandra Lang (Earth-616) from Young Avengers Presents Vol 1 4 001.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Stature training at [[Camp Hammond]]]]
===Initiative and Secret Invasion===
Cassie later joined the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] and began training at [[Camp Hammond]], [[Connecticut (State)|Connecticut]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #1}} During her time at Camp Hammond, Cassie met her father's successor [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Eric O'Grady]], the new [[Ant-Man]]. O'Grady made several disparaging remarks about her father, not realizing that she was within earshot. This caused a literally giant-sized brawl between the two. [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]] grew to his giant size and quickly intervened. [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] used the distraction to attack, but after a brief brawl, O'Grady and Cassie was able to reconcile.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #8}}

After journeying around the world, [[Vision (Jonas) (Earth-616)|Vision]] arrived at Camp Hammond disguised as Tony Stark to visit Cassie. In order to take her out on a date. Vision confesses that he shares Iron Lad's attraction to her, and hopes that she can love him. Cassie is unsure of her situation, but open to the possibility.{{r|Young Avengers Presents #4}}

Cassie once accidentally injured her stepfather Blake, while stopping the [[Growing Man (Earth-6311)|Growing Man]]. Her guilt causes her to shrink and the other Young Avengers attempt to snap her out of it before she shrinks into non-existence. She comes to terms with the responsibilities and risks of her position as part of the Young Avengers and the Initiative, reasoning that Blake also understands the risks as a policeman.{{r|Young Avengers Presents #5}}

During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]], Stature fought against the [[Skrull]]s in [[Manhattan]] as part of the Initiative.{{r|Secret Invasion #3}} She grew larger than the [[Criti Noll (Clone) (Earth-616)|Skrull Yellowjacket]] and punched him out.{{r|Secret Invasion #7}}

[[File:Mighty Avengers 0002.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Stature and Vision as part of the [[Mighty Avengers (Pym) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]]]]
===Mighty Avengers===
When Stature and Vision received an ominous message from Wiccan, they arrived at the [[Avengers Mansion]] to find the other Young Avengers apparently turned to stone. However, [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]], disguised as the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] appeared to whisk them away and offer them positions on her new [[Mighty Avengers (Pym) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]].{{r|Mighty Avengers #21}} For a time, Stature and Vision split their time between both Mighty Avengers and Young Avengers.

During the [[Siege]] of [[Asgard]], the Young Avengers joined the battlefield alongside all the heroes available. Stature and Vision assisted the Mighty Avengers,{{r|Siege #2|#3}} while the other Young Avengers helped elsewhere.{{r|Siege: Young Avengers #1}}

===The Children's Crusade===
After Wiccan's powers overloaded and the Avengers decided to keep him under observation, the other Young Avengers broke Wiccan out of holding and began the search for the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]. Accompanied by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], the team traveled to [[Transia]] and then to [[Latveria]] before discovering a depowered and amnesiac Wanda engaged to [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]. The rediscovery of Wanda did not go unnoticed though, as the Avengers soon arrived on the scene. A battle with Doom's [[Doombot|Doombot army]] soon broke out and was only stopped by the arrival of [[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|Iron Lad]].{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #1|#4}}

[[File:Cassandra Lang (Earth-616) and Victor von Doom (Earth-616) from Avengers The Children's Crusade Vol 1 9 0001.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Stature battling [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]]]

Iron Lad took the Young Avengers and Wanda into the timestream in an attempt to regroup and restore Wanda's memories. The group arrived at the [[Avengers Mansion]], shortly before the Scarlet Witch originally killed some of her fellow Avengers. Cassie used this opportunity to save her [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|father]]'s life from [[Jonathan Hart (Earth-616)|Jack of Hearts]]. This trip was successful in restoring all of Wanda's powers and memories. Returning to the present Avengers Mansion, Wanda and the Young Avengers were met by [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]], and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]].

With Wanda's memories restored, she desired to make amends for [[M-Day]], but was unsure how. To determine if she could repower any [[Homo Superior|mutants]], a volunteer was needed: [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] from [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations]]. Wanda was successful in restoring his powers, but the celebration was cut short by the arrival of both the Avengers and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|{{cl|Avengers: The Children's Crusade Vol 1 5}}-[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade Vol 1 #6|#6]]}}

With tensions high, a brawl broke out between the Avengers, Young Avengers, X-Factor, and X-Men over the custody and fate of the Scarlet Witch, forcing Wanda to put everyone to sleep in an attempt to quell the fighting. Next, with the Young Avengers, Wanda returned to Doom in Latveria to regain her reality warping powers. However, during the ritual to restore her powers, Patriot intervened, but Doom betrayed them, stealing the power for himself.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #7}}

[[File:Scott Lang (Earth-616), Cassandra Lang (Earth-616), and Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311) from Avengers The Children's Crusade Vol 1 9 001.jpg|thumb|left|210px|The death of Cassie Lang]]
Armed with the reality warping powers, Doom returned to [[New York City]] to offer the Avengers and X-Men a choice: join him or perish. During the ensuing battle, Doom's powers were overloaded and depleted. Unfortunately, Stature gave her life to defeat Doom.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #8}}

Iron Lad proposed saving Stature by traveling into the timestream, but Vision refused, resulting in his destruction at the hands of Iron Lad. Although Wiccan warned of the danger of becoming [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]], Iron Lad left with the intent of altering the timestream to suit his will and promising he would be much better than Kang.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #9}}

In the aftermath of the battle, the Young Avengers disbanded and remained low profile for some time until Captain America officially inducted all the remaining Young Avengers (Hawkeye, Hulkling, Speed, and Wiccan) as full-fledged Avengers, and a memorial to Stature and Vision was unveiled.{{r|Avengers: The Children's Crusade #9}}

[[File:Cassandra Lang (Earth-616) from Avengers World Vol 1 16 001.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Cassie returns]]
===Rebirth===
Soon after the [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]], an inversion spell affected the moral axis of numerous superheroes and villains. One of them was [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], who became noble, and set out to fix the mistakes of his past.{{r|Avengers World #15}} With the help of [[Avengers (Doctor Doom's) (Earth-616)|several heroes he assembled as a team of Avengers]], Doom condensed a portion of the inverted Scarlet Witch's power to manipulate reality into a device in order to right his wrongs, but only had enough power to right one sin and chose to revive Cassie. Cassie was brought back to life, and soon re-encountered her father.{{r|Avengers World #16}}

===Becoming Stinger===
After her return, Cassie resumed middle school and apparently suspended her superheroic activities, presumably following her mother's wishes; she then reluctantly moved to Miami with her, as her mother wanted her to be safe from the dangers brought by her father's activities. However, Scott chose to move out to Miami as well to be with Cassie.{{r|Ant-Man Vol 1 1}} She was unfortunately kidnapped by [[William Cross (Earth-616)|Crossfire]] on behalf of [[Augustine Cross (Earth-616)|Augustine Cross]], who believed that her Pym Particles-irradiated heart would be perfect to sustain the body of his father Darren, which he intended to revive;{{r|Ant-Man Vol 1 4}} Scott arrived too late to prevent the transplant, but with Dr. [[Erica Sondheim (Earth-616)|Erica Sondheim]]'s help he was able to make her body accept a new heart, thus saving her life. Sondheim told Cassie, Blake and Peggy that Cassie had a heart attack and Scott saved her life. However, Scott was so shaken by this experience that he decided to leave Cassie, not wishing to put her in harm's way again and wanting her to live a happy and normal life.{{r|Ant-Man Vol 1 5}}
[[File:Cassandra Lang (Earth-616) from Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 8 004.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Cassie Lang as Stinger]]
Scott couldn't resist the urge to accompany his daughter, and started stalking her while in miniature size,{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #1}} something that enraged Cassie after Scott confessed his behavior, and led her to resent her father even more than when she simply believed he had distanced from her.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #4}} Cassie's increasing frustration prompted her to enlist in a mobile app developed by the [[Power Broker (Power Broker, Inc.) (Earth-616)|Power Broker]] called [[Hench App|Hench]] that facilitated anybody a supervillain career, with the intention to shut it down from the inside. However, Power Broker's revelation of the truth behind Cassie's latest health problem ensured her collaboration in infiltrating Cross Technologies as [[Stinger]], in order to shut down Cross's own app, a copy and rival of Hench called Lackey.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #6}}

Stinger's mission resulted in her abduction at the hands of Cross,{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #8}} but Ant-Man assembled a group of hired supervillains to retrieve her.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #9}} The rescue mission was successful, but the police were alerted of the intrusion.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #10}} In order to protect Cassie, Scott took the blame for the situation and was arrested.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #11}}

Shortly after Scott faced trial, Cassie confessed to Peggy that she hadn't been kidnapped and used by Scott as he made people believe, and insisted her father's predicament was her fault.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #12}} Once Peggy understood Scott had been a good influence on her daughter, and that she couldn't keep Cassie from adventuring, she allowed her daughter to carry on a superheroic career together with her father, who eventually walked free from the trial, as the duo of Ant-Man and Stinger.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #13}}

===[[Secret Empire (Event)|Secret Empire]]===
When [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] took over the United States under the leadership of a [[Cosmic Cube]]-altered Captain America,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} Scott forced Cassie to take refuge in France{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 2}} while he joined the resistance efforts of the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} Unfortunately, Hydra's forces got hold of Cassie, and used her as leverage to force Scott to become a mole.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 6}}

| Powers                  = '''Pym Particles:''' Cassie was born as a normal human without any superpowers, but through intentional, repeated exposure to [[Pym Particles]],{{r|Young Avengers #3}} she gained the following abilities:
* '''''Size Reduction:''''' Cassie possessed the power to reduce herself to the size of an ant, approximately one-half inch in height.{{r|Young Avengers #3}}
* '''''Size Addition:''''' Cassie possessed the power to increase size to gigantic heights, requiring the rapid acquisition of body mass (presumably from an extradimensional source). This extra mass fortifies all of her cellular tissue, including her bones and muscles, enabling her to support her increased weight and giving her superhuman strength and durability. The exact limits of Cassie's abilities were not initially determined, but it was later established that she can grow to around 250 feet (76 m) in height (even though she is not able to keep such a size for long before the strain forces her to shrink back down).{{r|Mighty Avengers #24}} 
* These abilities are similar to those of [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|her father]], [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Giant-Man]], [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]], [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Goliath]], [[Rita DeMara (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]], [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Atlas]], and the new [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]].
| Abilities               = '''Hand-to-Hand Combat:''' She has above-average combat skills from taking self-defense classes, because of how many times she was kidnapped as a child. She was also trained by Captain America and Wolverine as well.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #6}}

'''Initiative Training:''' She has received militaristic strategies and training during her time with the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]].{{r|{{cl|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 1}}-[[Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 #8|#8]]}}{{r|Dark Reign: Young Avengers #3}}
| Strength                = Somewhere between 25 tons and 75 tons.
| Weaknesses              = '''Weak Points:''' When Cassie grows bigger, her Achilles tendons and nerve clusters grow in proportion, creating large, easy-to-hit targets.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #8}}

'''Emotional State:''' Cassie's abilities appear to be affected by her emotional state, as her anger has caused her to increase on a few several occasions,{{r|Young Avengers #2}}{{r|I Am an Avenger #4}} and guilt caused her to shrink.{{r|Young Avengers Presents #5}}{{r|I Am an Avenger #4}} 

| Equipment               = 
'''Stinger's Suit:''' Cassie's new costume, like her old one is made of [[unstable molecules]], allowing it to grow and shrink along with her.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #7}}
* '''[[Bio-Synthetic Wings]]:''' Cassie now has a pair of wings on her back that allow her to fly.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man #7}}

'''[[Stature's Suit]]:''' Cassie's former costume was made of [[unstable molecules]], allowing it to grow and shrink along with her. It appears to be based largely on her father's uniform. Rather than the [[Ant-Man's Helmet|insect-controlling helmet]] of her father and his predecessor, Cassie wears a domino mask.{{r|Young Avengers #6}}

| Notes                   = * Cassie's [[Stinger]] moniker originated from [[Cassandra Lang (Earth-982)|her counterpart]] in the [[Earth-982|MC2 Universe]].
| Trivia                  = * Cassie's first two crushes were on villains. The first crush was on the former ward of [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Dr. Doom]], [[Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)|Kristoff Vernard]]. The second crush was on [[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|Iron Lad]], the teenage version of [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]].
* Cassie applied for a babysitter job with [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]] and [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]], though more in the hope of eventually finding her way into the ranks of the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] rather than any dedication to babysitting itself.{{r|New Avengers #7}}
* According to solicitation text for the second issue of the new volume of ''She-Hulk'', Cassie was to be known as [[Titan]] rather than Stature. It is unknown the reason behind the change, although speculation leans towards too great a similarity the Teen Titans title from DC Comics.
* Cassie was 9 years old during her first appearance{{r|Marvel Premiere Vol 1 47}} and almost 15 by the time she joined the Young Avengers.{{r|Young Avengers #2}}
** Cassie's birthday is in June.{{r|Young Avengers #2}}
