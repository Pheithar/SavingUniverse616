| History                 = ===Early Life===

Kevin MacTaggert is the son of mutant expert [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggert]], and politician [[Joseph MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Joe MacTaggert]]. Like his mother, the boy is a [[Homo Superior|mutant]] with the ability to warp realities. These powers burn out his body, leaving him in need of new host bodies to sustain himself. Kevin's only known weaknesses are metal and his need for fresh host bodies.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 127}} Due to the unstable nature of his powers, Moira confined Kevin to a maximum security cell inside her mutant research facility located on [[Muir Island]].{{r|X-Men #104}}
[[File:Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616) from Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 8 002.jpg|thumb|Kevin before his transformation into his energy form: Proteus.]]

===The Sweet Escape===

During a battle between [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], the facility's security was compromised and Kevin's cell was damaged. This caused what remained of his body to burn out and required him to look for a new host. When [[Angus MacWhirter (Earth-616)|a man]] came to destroy Moira's laboratory, Kevin possessed him and hid until he could escape the island.{{r|X-Men #119}} He later tried to possess [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] and [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], but both attempts failed. Kevin managed to escape the island in one of [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]]'s duplicate bodies and began a quest to find and possess his father's body.{{r|X-Men #125|126}}

Even with the timely intervention of the X-Men, Kevin still managed to possess the body of his father, Joe, leaving a trail of discarded host bodies in his wake. During the battle, however, Joe's body also burned out leaving Kevin (now calling himself Proteus) vulnerable in his energy form. The X-Man [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] used his metal form to slay the boy. His energies were disrupted and scattered all over Scotland. All thought Kevin to be dead.{{r|X-Men #127|128}}

===Proteus Reborn?===

Sometime later, a woman by the name of Erika Benson (also known as [[Erika Benson (Earth-616)|Harness]]) was hired by [[AIM]] to use her son, Gilbert Benson whom she called [[Gilbert Benson (Earth-616)|Piecemeal]], to collect the energies of Proteus for their own use. Gilbert had the ability to absorb the energies that were once Proteus, and his mother intended to collect it all.{{r|New Mutants Annual Vol 1 7}}{{r|New Warriors Annual Vol 1 1}} Her mission was almost thwarted by the [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]], [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]] as well as Moira MacTaggert and a number of her mutants from Muir Island. Their intervention failed, and Gilbert's body exploded, resulting in a fusion entity that was both Gilbert Benson and Kevin MacTaggert.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Annual 1991}}
[[File:Proteus (Gestalt) (Earth-616) from X-Factor Annual Vol 1 6 0001.jpg|thumb|Kevin reborn as Proteus (Gestalt).]]

This new Proteus used his powers to reshape Edinburgh, Scotland to his own whim. The arrival of [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] brought a philosophical tone to the battle, as the heroes questioned the ethics of killing Proteus or trying to help them. In the end, Proteus realized that reality was not compatible with him and "killed" himself.{{r|X-Factor Annual #6}}

===Return===

Kevin was not dead, due to his body being a lattice of energy. He had only entered a low-energy resting state, making him both dead and alive at the same time.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #232}} He survived [[M-Day]]. When [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]] and [[Eliphas (Earth-616)|Eli Bard]] used the trans-mode virus to resurrect the dead, a piece of Proteus was carried with them, creating a link he could use to restore himself. Using the mutant [[Irene Adler (Earth-616)|Destiny]] he distorted her visions to lure [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]] to Muir Island.{{r|X-Necrosha #1}} Turning her into a psychic magnet, she collected up his fragments. Getting the final piece from Destiny, Blindfold became Proteus' new host. He proceeded to attack the X-Men with his newly expanded powers, such as possessing Blindfold, Destiny, [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]], [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]], and [[Hope Abbott (Earth-616)|Trance]], turning the iron in [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]'s blood into lead, and knocking out [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] while destroying the Blackbird's cockpit. As he was about to kill [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], Magneto launched both himself and Proteus into orbit.

With prolonged proximity to Proteus, Magneto was able to analyze his energy matrix while simultaneously using his electromagnetic powers to shield himself from Proteus' possession. After enough study, Magneto was able to change the part of Proteus that allowed him to possess Blindfold, and kick him out of her body. Unstable, Proteus dissipated. Magneto, however, warned that Proteus would be back.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #231|233}}

===[[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|A Man Called X]]===

Proteus was found drifting in the [[Astral Plane]] by the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] and became his new source of power, being used in an endless battle between the entity and Xavier, who had been forced to partake in this following his death at the hands of [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]. In the battle's final moments, Proteus was spread as a psychic infection on [[London (England)|London]] by the Shadow King, and was unwittingly reconstituted by Xavier (now inhabiting [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]]'s body and calling himself X) once he had dealt with the Shadow King with the help of his X-Men.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 1|7}}

X and Psylocke confronted Proteus telepathically, and Kevin attempted convince the mutant heroes that he had no evil intentions and simply wanted freedom, and that he was willing to let bygones be bygones, but would defend himself if threatened. When X reacted poorly, Proteus trapped him and Psylocke in a "reality storm" that painfully merged them together before fleeing.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 8}} Proteus traveled to the Scottish village of [[Fetters Hill]], in order to carry out an experiment as part of his plan to merge the real world with the Astral Plane. He granted the citizens of the town the ability to make real whatever they wished.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 9}} The village quickly fell into chaos, and it became a gestalt of the villagers' mindscapes. When the X-Men tried to confront Proteus, he made Fetters Hill erupt,{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 10}} launching seeds into many cities of the world with the objective to transform them as well. As the damage he caused to reality was being reversed by Psylocke and X, Proteus was seemingly destroyed by [[Lucas Bishop (Earth-1191)|Bishop]] and Rogue, who converted Kevin's energy and absorbed it, respectively, until he exploded.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 11}}

===[[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]===

Proteus was somehow brought back to life on the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] and provided with a steady supply of braindead Xavier clones as host bodies. He became a member of [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]], a group of mutants capable of combining their powers to resurrect dead mutants. He and the rest of The Five were considered something sacred to be treasured by the other mutants on the island.
[[File:Five (Earth-616) from House of X Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|Proteus and the Five.]]

Because Proteus' powers lead to the destruction of its own body, The Five keep a backup Xavier body prepared for Proteus to inhabit after he burned out his current one. Depending on the frequency with which he used his powers, a body normally lasted one week, or even a single day during periods of excessive power use.

Xavier tasked The Five with resurrecting [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]], [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]], [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]], [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Penance]], [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] who died stopping the creation of Nimrod.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}} The Five had previously resurrected other long deceased mutants, such as [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], and [[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]] and [[Esme Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Esme Cuckoo]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}}

With the possibility of mutants being reported dead without proper proof [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] was created to solve the mysterious of reported mutants to help Proteus and the Five to not resurrect already living mutants and hurry through the resurrection queue.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 1}}

===[[X of Swords]]=== 

Proteus (with the rest of the Five) was tasked with bringing back [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] and [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]] back to life after their demise and betrayal from [[Summoner (Arakko) (Earth-616)|Summoner]]. As Rockslide died in [[Otherworld]], his backup was corrupted and was resurrected [[Santo Vaccarro (Multiverse)|broken]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 4}} The same happened with [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]], as he died in battle against the [[White Sword (Earth-616)|White Sword]] as his backup was corrupted.{{r|Cable Vol 4 6}}

===[[King in Black]]===

During [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]'s attack on Krakoa using [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Kid Cable]] as a host, the Five were hidden in the Hatchery to ensure the survival of the mutant race. "Protocol V" was activated by [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Commander Brand]] for [[Marvin Flumm (Earth-616)|Mentallo]] to bring them to [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]] space so they could repopulate the mutant (and human) race a safe distance away. They easily overtook him and stayed on Krakoa.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 2|3}}

===[[Hellfire Gala]]===

During the Hellfire Gala, Proteus was called away with other [[Mutant Power Level Classification#List of Omega-Level Mutants Identified in the Krakoa era|Omega Level mutants]] to terraform [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]] in order for it to be suitable for the living island [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]] to merge with and it's citizens to claim as their new home.{{r|Planet-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}}

** '''Power Augmentation''' 

Kevin currently possesses husks of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] which he uses as host with all of his [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)#Powers|powers]] and potential.  

| Abilities               = 
| Strength                = Proteus has no physical strength save for that which he gets from his host bodies, which is currently a [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)#Strength|Charles Xavier]] husk.
| Weaknesses              = * Proteus is vulnerable to metal, which can disrupt his energy fields, and damage his host bodies (although this doesn't mean he can't warp metal and metallic objects when he warps reality).

* The more he uses his powers, the faster he destroys his host bodies.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}

| Notes                   = * Every time Proteus uses his powers in conjunction with the Five, the process becomes easier and faster, as he gets stronger.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}  
* Proteus and the Five make continuous husk of Charles Xavier for Proteus to inhabit since in the past has quickly burned out the host bodies he possessed. Due to his powers getting stronger with his unification of the Five, it is unknown if his weakness has dulled down and uses husk less frequently.{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}}
