===Xavier's Institute===
Hisako Ichiki (市来 久子, '''Ichiki Hisako''') lived in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] with her brother and parents before joining the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]].{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 37}} When the [[X-Men Training Squads|training squad system]] began, Armor was placed with [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]]'s [[Paladins (Earth-616)|Paladins Squad]] with [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]] and [[Edward Tancredi (Earth-616)|Wing]]. Armor formed a close friendship with Wing, and even described him as being her best friend.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 4}}{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 7|8}} 

===The Cure, Ord and Breakworld===
While at the Xavier Institute, Armor and Wing were attacked by [[Ord (SWORD) (Earth-616)|Ord]] of [[Breakworld]]. Armor used her [[Homo superior|mutant]] powers to punch Ord, taking him by surprise.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 4}} Following a brief scrimmage, Armor and Wing were overpowered by Ord, and Wing was injected with the [[Hope Serum]]. Depressed by the loss of his powers, he committed suicide in the [[Danger Room]]. After Wing's death, Armor, [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]], and [[Xavier Institute student body|other Xavier students]] found themselves trapped in a sentient and hostile Danger Room. [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]] eventually fled the Institute.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 7|11}}
[[File:Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616) from Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 4 001.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Original Blue Armor]]

During [[Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-616)|Cassandra Nova]]'s psychic manipulation and attack of the X-Men, Armor was able to protect Blindfold and a childlike [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] from a feral [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]].{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 15}}

Armor was with the X-Men when they were abducted to [[Breakworld]] by [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] because Breakworld had developed a weapon capable of destroying the [[Earth]].{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 18|19}}

Ord alerted Breakworld's ruler to the arrival of the X-Men, and they sent a fleet to attack their ship. S.W.O.R.D.'s ship was heavily damaged after the attack, and the X-Men were separated. Armor ended up with Wolverine, who inducted her into the X-Men. Armor was given one of Kitty Pryde's uniforms. Armor aided the X-Men in liberating Breakworld and saving Earth.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 19|25}}{{r|Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men Vol 1 1}}

===M-Day and Messiah Complex===
In the wake of [[Decimation|M-Day]], only 27 students (including Armor) retained their mutant powers.{{r|Decimation: House of M - The Day After #1}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 20}}{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}} Along with most of the other powered students, Armor participated in [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]'s battle royale to become a member of the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 23}}

[[File:New X-Men (Earth-616) from New X-Men Vol 2 44 0001.jpg|200px|thumb|left|On mission with the New X-Men]]
Armor briefly joined the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]] when [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]] assembled the team against the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]]. At the Purifiers' headquarters, they discovered [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] of [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] there, and that the Purifiers didn't have the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Messiah baby]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 44}} Preparing to leave, the group was attacked by [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]], who mortally wounded [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]]. Pixie teleported the group, but they were spread out between the Mansion and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C.]]. Armor was brought back to the mansion by [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] with the other New X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 205}} When a [[Predator X]] showed up at the mansion, Armor teamed up with [[Nezhno Abidemi (Earth-616)|Gentle]] and battled it in the infirmary. [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]], believing [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] could defeat the monster, teleported it and the entire team, along with Armor, to the battle between the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] and the X-Teams taking place on [[Muir Island]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 46}}

===Manifest Destiny and Utopia===
When [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] declared [[San Francisco]] a new haven for [[Homo superior|mutantkind]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 499|500}} Armor was among those to relocate to the west.

Having proven herself on Breakworld, Armor was officially inducted into the X-Men. She accompanied the team while investigating the [[Ghost boxes]],{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 25|27}} during the discovery of [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]]'s mutants,{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 28|30}} exploring the [[Sentinels|Bio-Sentinel]],{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 31|35}} and researching a seeming surge of mutant births in Karere, [[Mbangawi]].{{r|Astonishing X-Men: Xenogenesis #1|5}} Armor also fought alongside [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] and [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]] in [[San Francisco]] during the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|Invasion]].{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men Vol 1 1|4}}

Once [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]] joined the X-Men on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], Armor confronted her in the [[X-Brig]] about her part in Wing's death. They battled, until Danger disclosed that she sees Wing inside her program everyday, and that she is trying to learn about mutants. Armor realized that Danger felt guilty about what happened to Wing, and agreed to teach her about mutants, starting with Wing.{{r|Nation X #3}}

[[File:Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616) and James Howlett (Earth-616) from Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 36 0001.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Armor's powers boost significantly with the death of her mother and brother]]
While training with Wolverine, Armor's exoskeleton enlarged to mammoth-size. Shortly after, she was informed her mother and brother had died. Accompanied by Cyclops, [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], and Wolverine, she returned to Japan to attend their funeral and reconnect with her [[Mr. Ichiki (Earth-616)|distant father]].{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 36|37}}

===Jean Grey School of Higher Learning===
After the [[Schism (Event)|schism]] between Wolverine and Cyclops, Armor followed Wolverine back to the ruins in [[Westchester County|Westchester]], to rebuild the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] into the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning.{{r|X-Men: Schism #5}}{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #1}} For a brief period she could not control her armored constructs, having been forcibly teleported out of one by [[Demon Bamfs|several Bamfs]].{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 2 8}} When Wolverine died, Hisako said that she felt his death, like when a family member died. She grieved by fighting simulations of Wolverine's villains in the Danger Room, as when she fought, she 'felt closer to him.' Hellion consoled her, saying that she had a small piece of Logan with her.{{r|Death of Wolverine: Life After Logan #1}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Armor was one of the many mutants that opposed the crazed [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|X-Man]] from remaking the world in his image. When X-Man realized that his vision of the world would never come about with the X-Men around, X-Man made his enemies vanish in an instant, including Hisako.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 #1|10}}

===Age of X-Man===
In the reality created by [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]] and a [[Life Seed]], a world where everyone on Earth was a mutant and relationships were strongly discouraged or illegal, Armor was a student at the Summers Institute for Higher Learning in [[Westchester County]]. Like its mainstream reality counterpart, [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], the Summers Institute taught mutant children how to control their mutant abilities.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha #1}}{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen #1}}
[[File:Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616) from Age of X-Man Nextgen Vol 1 2 001.png|180px|thumb|left|In the Age of X-Man reality]]

Armor was a student at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Summers Institute for Higher Learning]] in the Civil Management Division. Hisako interrupted the twins, [[Manon (Mutant) (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Manon]] and [[Maxime (Mutant) (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Maxime]], while they were harassing [[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob Herman]] about having no friends. She told them if they kept at it, she would tell [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Dean Angel]] about it. Hisako then told Glob that they were both late to lunch.<!-- {{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen #1}} -->

During lunch, Hisako sat around while her fellow peers made fun of Glob because he wrote [[X-Men Disassembled|fan fiction]]. [[Iara Dos Santos (Earth-616)|Shark-Girl]] mentioned that his book dealt with all them being [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and how they went on adventures and battled foes. Hisako ended up grabbing the book from [[Megan Gwynn (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Pixie]] after she took it from Glob. She then proceeded to give it back to him. They left the lunch room where they all promised to meet up later to study.<!-- {{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen #1}} -->

Armor was then in [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Mr. Yoshida]]'s Civil Management class as he was talking to everyone about embarking on the mentorship program with [[Department X (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Department X]] clerks. They had a special guest from the department, [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]], who touched base with the students on the daily routine of the clerks.<!-- {{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen #1}} -->

After school, Hisako and the others made it to the [[Hope Summers Memorial Library]] to study when [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]] noticed that there was a huge fire further downtown. Armor and Pixie ended up going to the disturbance as that was what they were training to be. When they arrived at the burning house, Hisako and Megan were then confronted by [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Clerk Blob]] who apprehended their friend [[Roxanne Washington (Earth-616)|Bling!]].<!-- {{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen #1}} -->

As the two girls were making their way to the front to avoid getting in trouble, Armor found [[Victor Borkowski (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Anole]] jumping from an upper window of the house onto the grass. As he saw Armor, he begged and pleaded with her not to say anything to anyone about him being there, and as he was in a state of panic, he ran straight into a bush that led into a forest.<!-- {{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen #1}} -->

Hisako later showed up to Glob's room to discuss what happened at the site. As she finished her story, Glob said that he could not allow this to happen again. As she mentioned that Anole said the same thing, Glob reached for a candle as he told her that there could be no more lies and that she deserved to know the truth. When she asked what he was talking about, Glob apologized, and with his hand then embroiled in flames, he reached for her explaining that it was the only way that he could show her the truth.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen #1}}

After Nate Grey transformed all of the mutants back into their mainstream counterparts, Armor was shown standing in front of a portal in the Danger Room Prison Complex with Anole and Glob.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega #1}}

===Dawn of X===
Armor later became a citizen of the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. She helped spread Krakoa's reach by planting a [[Flowers of Krakoa|Krakoan flower]] on the planet [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}}

Wanting to make sure that all mutants could have joined the mutant paradise of Krakoa, including those who didn’t answer Professor Xavier’s invitation, Armor started to track down [[Barnell Bohusk (Earth-616)|Barnell Bohusk]], AKA "Beak", and his wife, [[Angel Salvadore (Earth-616)|Angel Salvadore]]. With the help of Sage and Boom-Boom, Armor was able to cure Beak’s father's rare form of dementia thanks to Krakoa's wonder drugs that could cure many human diseases. Unfortunately, a group of anti-mutant mercenaries followed the New Mutants on their journey to Nebraska and captured Beak and Angel's kids in order to negotiate for Krakoan medicine.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 3}}

She joined several other mutants in rescuing [[Natashia Repina (Earth-616)|Tashi Repina]] from the anti mutant country of [[Carnelia]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 9}}

| Powers                  = 
Armor is a [[Homo superior|mutant]] with powers based around a psionic exoskeleton, including:
[[File:Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616) and Fin Fang Foom (Earth-616) from Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 37 0001.jpg|thumb|Armor facing off against [[Fin Fang Foom (Earth-616)|Fin Fang Foom]]]]
*'''Psionic Exoskeleton-Armor:''' Armor can generate an enormously strong, powerful, durable, and impenetrable psionic exoskeleton armor around her entire physical body. It can be further enhanced by drawing more power, energy, and strength from the bloodline of her Japanese ancestors. This exoskeleton drastically enhances her strength, endurance, stamina, agility, invulnerability, and durability, though she can only maintain it for short periods of time lest the effort leave her drained. In situations of extreme emotional stress, Armor can significantly enhance her exoskeleton's size, strength, agility, dexterity, and durability, but she can only do so briefly as the strain can render her unconscious. The strength, power, and size of her psionic armor greatly enhances and increases tremendously when her relatives die.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 36}} In addition, the body armor greatly heightens and strengthens the concussive force behind her offensive and incredibly destructive blows, and makes her practically invulnerable and immune from a significant degree of physical harm and damage. To some extent, she can shape her armor, such as her ability to form Wolverine-like claws and make them extend outward.
**'''Superhuman Strength:''' Her body armor greatly strengthens and amplifies the concussive force behind her unusually offensive and highly destructive blows. Her psionic armor grants her enough superhuman strength to lift a Skrull ground tank and punch someone through several walls of a building and even assisted Colossus in restraining a small ship capable of breaking orbit from lifting off.
**'''Superhuman Durability/Invulnerability:''' The body armor is depicted as enveloping her completely and protects her from tremendously strong and powerful attacks and in some depictions, Armor's armor is strong and durable enough to survive the heat caused from a long fall through the atmosphere. Likewise, she is able to fully withstand the impact from falling to the ground from high up in the atmosphere without any physical or external injury.
**'''Concussive Blast:''' She can cause her armor to release a large, solid, concussive blast of energy, but it takes a lot of concentration.

| Abilities               = *Armor has received combat training from Wolverine and classes in tactics from Cyclops.
*Armor speaks Japanese.
| Strength                = 
| Weaknesses              ='''Power Limitation''': *Armor's psionic-energy exoskeleton armor is vulnerable to lasers as "it has to let light in," and [[Adamantium]] due to its unique and special abilities and properties, such as Wolverine's claws, although he is not able to go through it with the rest of his body. In this case, she only remained uninjured because the distance between her armor's perimeter and her body was slightly greater than the length of Wolverine's claws.

*'''Cost Of Power:''' Armor's powers increase when a member of her family dies. 

| Equipment               = 
| Transportation          = 
| Weapons                 = 

| Notes                   = * With [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]]'s departure/sacrifice in the [[Breakworld]], Armor officially took her place in the roster of Astonishing X-Men.

* Armor later confronted [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]] to get revenge for [[Edward Tancredi (Earth-616)|Wing]]'s death; however, Danger revealed that despite being a mechanical entity and having repeatedly deleted and adjusted her memory banks, she still cannot erase the guilt she feels from the incident. This appeased Armor.

* Armor's body armor is initially partially explained as being somehow composed of something related to her family lineage and ancestors. It is later described as being composed of memory. This is stated in an issue of Wolverine: Origins, when Armor's armor is able to withstand blows from the Muramasa blade, which can cut through any material, since memory is "the only material that the blade cannot cut through." Similarly, in Astonishing X-Men, vol. 3 #39, Armor's armor expands and grows to the size of a building due to the fact she feels strongly about not attending her recently deceased mother and brother's wake.
