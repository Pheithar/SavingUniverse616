| History                 = Jared was a [[Hydra (Earth-616)|HYDRA]] field agent, who on orders by his superior [[General Wyndham (Earth-616)|General Wyndham]] started a romantic relationship with [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Jessica Drew]], in order to keep an eye on her, while she was briefly a part of the organization.{{r|Marvel Spotlight #32}}{{r|Spider-Woman: Origin #2|3}} When Kurtz was captured by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] during a "goodwill mission", Drew, under her original codename "Agent Arachne", sneaked into a holding facility to free him, only to inadvertently kill him in the ensuing firefight.{{r|Marvel Spotlight #32}}

It was only later that she learned that Jared was actually on a bombing mission in [[Morocco]] that killed several civilians, and that the entirety of HYDRA was nothing but a ruthless terrorist squad.{{r|Spider-Woman: Origin #3}}

It was later further established, that he, in fact, didn't die at all at the hands of Jessica during his escape attempt but, was kept as a prisoner in a S.H.I.E.L.D. holding cell under psychic interrogation for 8 months before being freed by his fellow agents. He later confronted Jessica in the nightclub [[Excelsior (Nightclub)|Excelsior]] in [[London (England)|London]] and attempted to kill her for abandoning and betraying their organization, but she knocked him unconscious, strapped him on a plane, and crashed it into a nearby HYDRA facility before making her escape.{{r|Spider-Woman: Origin #3}}
