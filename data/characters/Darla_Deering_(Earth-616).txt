| History                 = Darla Deering was a pop star who dated [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Johnny Storm]], the Human Torch of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantasic Four]].

When [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]] planned a trip through space and time, he tasked each member of the team to find a suitable replacement just in case, as the travel was through time, they would return four minutes after they departed. 

As Johnny forgot to find one, he rushed to Darla's apartment and asked her to take his spot in the Fantastic Four, alongside [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] (replacing Mr. Fantastic), [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] (replacing the Invisible Woman) and [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] (replacing The Thing), which she accepted. Four minutes after the Fantastic Four departed, they didn't return, prompting the newly cobbled together team to become the acting Fantastic Four and watch over the Future Foundation.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 4 2}}
