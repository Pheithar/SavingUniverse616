While being interrogated by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, Hudak expressed disinterest in continuing his criminal career and even offered his services to S.H.I.E.L.D. in exchange for his freedom.{{r|Secret War Vol 1 5}} He is currently attempting to reconcile with his ex-wife.

The [[Savage Land Mutates]] approached him, offering cash to get [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]] out of imprisonment in the [[Raft]] (a job that went to [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]]). Still trying to distance himself from crime, Hudak hoped that the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] could deal with the problem and attest to his compliance.

===Pleasant Hill===
At some point, Scorcher was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. and incarcerated at [[Pleasant Hill]]. S.H.I.E.L.D. used the Kobik project on Scorcher which turned him into an unnamed Pleasant Hill firefighter.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Alpha Vol 1 1}} After escaping from the facility in the confusion caused by [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]], the Scorcher returned to his hideout in Brooklyn. Still suffering from the effects of the mind-tampering S.H.I.E.L.D. inflicted on him, he wanted to ensure that his past was actually real this time. Unfortunately, S.H.I.E.L.D. were staking out the hideout and again captured him. This time, however, he was freed by the Absorbing Man and Titania who were recruiting as many former Pleasant Hill inmates to the Hood's army as they could in order to exact revenge against those who did this to them. The Scorcher was among the villains dumped in the middle of Times Square by the Hood when the villains showed disdain for his plan of going after the families of the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 7}}
