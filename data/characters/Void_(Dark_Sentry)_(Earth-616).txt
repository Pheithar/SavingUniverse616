| Overview                = The Void is the black and destructive entity that bonded to [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Robert Reynolds]] when he became the [[Sentry]], and acts as a counterforce and embodiment of his negative aspects. It is more of a force than a person but can take any shape it chooses. When talking to and teasing Sentry, it normally uses human form. It is capable of destroying the [[Earth]], if not [[Earth-616|the entire universe]]. Robert fights a constant inner battle to keep the Void at bay as it comes into being every time he uses his powers and is his eternal nemesis, born in his own psyche.

| History                 = [[File:Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616) from Dark Avengers Vol 1 13 001.jpg|thumb|left|The Angel of Death]]
===Origin===
Though the exact origin of the Void is unknown, his first activities were seemingly traced all the way back to circa 1600 BCE, when [[Moses (Earth-616)|Moses]] pleaded for every Hebrew doorpost to be marked with lamb's blood in order to protect the Israelite firstborn from the final plague [[Yahweh (Earth-616)|God]] was going to bring on [[Ramses (Earth-616)|Pharaoh Ramses]] and on [[Egypt]]: the [[Angel of Death]], believed to be the Void himself{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 13}}{{r|Siege Vol 1 4}} (though other beings have been told to be that entity).

===The Sentry===
According to [[Lindy Lee (Earth-616)|Lindy Reynolds]],{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 13}} [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]],{{r|Siege Vol 1 4}} the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]],{{r|Annihilation - Scourge Omega Vol 1 1}} and the Void itself,{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 13}} the Void is a dark entity that bonded to [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Robert Reynolds]] when he consumed the serum that turned him into the Sentry. The Void next appeared a few years after the Sentry became famous; nearly killing [[Billy Turner (Earth-616)|Scout (Billy Turner)]], driving the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] into a rampage, and murdering over one million people in [[Manhattan]]. Discovering that the Void was the dark aspect of his own powers, the Sentry teamed up with [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] to create a system capable of making the [[Earth]]'s entire population, themselves included, forget all about him. With the Sentry inactive and forgotten, the Void vanished.

Years later, Robert's memories slowly returned along with the Void, who rampaged across [[Europe]], murdering many members of the [[Super Heroes of Europe (Earth-616)|Super-Heroes of Europe]]. The Sentry contacted his former colleagues, but the only one who recalled their shared history was the Hulk. As the Void returned to Manhattan, the pieces began to fall in place and the Sentry's former friends assembled to defend him and the city. Remembering the dual nature of Robert's powers, the Sentry and Reed Richards reactivated the [[Watchtower (Sentry)|Watchtower]], dispelling the Void and making the world forget the Sentry once again.{{r|Sentry Vol 1 4|5}}

The Sentry's memories soon returned, as did the Void. Returned to the world, the Sentry captured the hearts of the public, with newspapers referring to him as the Golden Guardian as he saved hundreds of lives on a daily basis. Reynolds' psychological problems, however, had worsened. Unable to reconcile that Robert Reynolds, Sentry and the Void were the same being, the Sentry contained the Void in a vault in the Watchtower. At [[Centrally Located Organic Computer (Earth-616)|C.L.O.C.]]'s urging, Reynolds' psychiatrist [[Cornelius Worth (Earth-616)|Dr. Cornelius Worth]] entered the vault only to find a chair and a mirror. When Cornelius confronted Reynolds with this, Reynolds became confused and ran to the fairgrounds where he first gained his powers.

Cornelius followed Reynolds to the fairgrounds, finding the Sentry and the Void fighting. The Void claimed that Reynolds transformed into the Void rather than the Sentry, and that the Sentry was merely a guilt-borne byproduct of that transformation. With only half of Reynolds' memories (the Void possessing the other half), the Sentry was not sure whether the Void was wrong or not. The Sentry chased the Void away and then explained to Cornelius why he had hired him in the first place: Reynolds subconsciously wanted someone to reveal the Void's existence to the world so he would no longer have to hide that aspect of himself. Sentry then told Cornelius how he really gained his powers as a teenager: by stealing the Professor's serum and ingesting it to get high. He also told Cornelius that he knew all along that the Void was never in the Watchtower's vault. He knew that if Reynolds believed the Void was in the Watchtower, the Void would be. This kept the world safe from the Void for as long as Sentry could keep up the charade.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 5}}

The Sentry then visited Doctor Strange to determine if he was real or not. Strange tricked the Sentry into traveling to his old Professor's research facility where the two men confined the Sentry in an illusionary realm where he was a mental patient and superheroes did not exist in an attempt to prevent any further destruction. The Sentry broke free of the illusion and after confronting the Professor who had made the original serum, traveled to [[Antarctica]] to confront the Void and discover what memories of Reynolds the Void had in his mind.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 6|7}}

The Void revealed that Reynolds had actually ingested a super-saturated, exponentially more potent version of the [[Super-Soldier Serum]] that created [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. This was considered dangerous by [[United States Government (Earth-616)|the government]] because Sentry's blood could be used to create more of the serum, enough for the entire world. Several failed attempts were made to kill both personas. Enraged by this revelation, Sentry threw the Void into the [[Sun (Star)|Sun]], telling his enemy that he no longer needed him to balance his own actions of good, but the Void promised to return.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 8}}

====New Avengers====
[[File:Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616) vs. New Avengers (Earth-616), Fantastic Four (Earth-616), and Stephen Strange (Earth-616) from New Avengers Vol 1 10 001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Attacking the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]]]]
The Sentry was later confronted by the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] and [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], along with the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. He cried, saying that he had warned them of the Void's coming and that it was too late now, before the group was suddenly attacked by the Void. Robert, with the help of [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], discovered that the reason no one remembered him was not because of his own attempts to erase the Void, but because of the intervention and manipulation of his mind by [[Jason Wyngarde (Earth-616)|Mastermind]], who was hired by the [[General (Earth-616)|General]] to use his great mental powers to contain the Sentry's abilities and force everyone (himself included) to forget of his existence. Should the Sentry ever remember his life, he would be struck by a fear of the devil attacking the world, hence the Void. With this newfound knowledge, the Void disappeared, and Emma Frost resurrected the Sentry. The Avengers offered him membership, partly to keep an eye on him and partly because they would needed his power, and he accepted.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 7|10}}

In a battle against [[Yelena Belova (Earth-616)|Yelena Belova]], the Sentry had his powers absorbed by her. This would prove to be her downfall, however, as it also exposed her to a manifestation of the Void, who enveloped and incapacitated her. The Sentry told Belova that he would send the Void away if she answered his questions, but she was liquefied by her employers before she could answer any of them.{{r|New Avengers Annual Vol 1 1}} During the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]]' [[Secret Invasion]], the Sentry left the Earth to not take part in the battle, believing that he had caused it. As a result of this, the Void created an equal and opposite reaction by showing up, battling Skrulls and saving [[Lindy Lee (Earth-616)|Lindy Reynolds]], promising to do all that the Sentry wouldn't do.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 14}}

[[File:Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616) and Cabal (Dark Illuminati) (Earth-616) from Dark Avengers Vol 1 15 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] using the Void to threaten the [[Cabal (Dark Illuminati) (Earth-616)|Cabal]]]]
====[[Dark Reign]]====
After becoming head of national security, [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] visited the Sentry, gaslighting him and gave him a vial of the same serum that originally gave him his powers. Once he drank it, the Void took over and accepted Osborn's offer to become his secret weapon, and keep his newly formed [[Cabal (Dark Illuminati) (Earth-616)|Cabal]] in line.{{r|{{cl|Dark Avengers Vol 1 1}}-[[Dark Avengers Vol 1 3|3]]}}{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 13}}

When Lindy tried to kill her husband with an alien weapon, fearing what he was becoming and his refusal to let her go, she then began forming theories about the Void's origins. Unfortunately, the Void asserted control of her husband, reviving him. A terrified Lindy pleaded for the Void to end her misery, to which the evil entity complied, only for Robert to intervene, reminding his counterpart of their deal of not touching her. Robert flew far from Earth, intending to commit suicide by plunging himself into the Sun, only to regenerate. The Void then taunted his efforts and pointed out that for all intents and purposes, he should give him complete control. He returned to [[New York City]] and started to destroy it, but was convinced not to by Osborn. The Void agreed to work for Osborn, cowing Doctor Doom when he threatened Osborn during a Cabal meeting.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 13|15}}

====[[Siege (Event)|The Siege of Asgard]]====
In [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]], the Void killed [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]] at the behest of Osborn, ripping him in half to do so. He was then sent to take [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] down. Before their fight was concluded, Osborn, who had been overcome by the forces of the Avengers, the [[Secret Warriors (Earth-616)|Secret Warriors]], and many other heroes, ordered the Void to end it. The Void broke the base of Asgard, completely destroying the city. Osborn, defeated and crazed, told the heroes that they would all be killed as the Void took on a monstrous form. Thor engaged the Void, but began to lose, until [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] took control of a damaged [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] Helicarrier in the area and used it as a bullet to strike the Void. The Void was finally defeated when Thor struck it with a powerful attack from [[Mjolnir]] after Robert pleaded him to be killed. Thor then took the Sentry's charred body and tossed it into the Sun.{{r|Siege Vol 1 4}} There, Robert's body was constantly regrown from an atom just to be burned down again afterwards. Bored of the cycle, the Void left him behind and went to the [[White Hot Room]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 11}}

[[File:Stephen Strange (Earth-616) and Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616) from Doctor Strange Vol 1 384 001.jpg|thumb|right|Possessing Doctor Strange]]
At some point, the Void (still separated from Robert) was captured by Doctor Strange and locked up inside the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]], from where he was later released by Strange himself to be used against [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]], who had become the new [[Sorcerer Supreme]] of Earth.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 384}} After revealing to Loki that the [[Exile of Singhsoon]] - a spell that transfers all the world's magic to its caster which Loki had been looking for - was inside [[Zelma Stanton (Earth-616)|Zelma Stanton]]'s soul, the Void was separated from Strange and locked back at the Sanctorum.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 385}}

[[File:Robert Reynolds (Earth-616) and Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616) from Sentry Vol 3 4 003.jpg|thumb|left|Merged with the Sentry.]]
====[[Sentry World]]====
With Robert's return as the Sentry, the Void was trapped within the [[Earth-TRN681|Sentry World]] - a pocket dimension created inside Robert's psyche by Doctor Strange.{{r|Sentry Vol 3 1}} As a result of the machinations of his his former protégé, Billy Turner, Robert fully embraced the Void and became one with it, transforming into a dark version of the Sentry.{{r|{{cl|Sentry Vol 3 4}}-[[Sentry Vol 3 5|5]]}} However, that didn't last long: the Void took over Robert again and steered him into conflict with [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and the [[Agents of Wakanda (Earth-616)|Agents of Wakanda]] in the small town of [[Pawhuska]]. [[Fat Cobra (Earth-616)|Fat Cobra]] stabilized the Sentry by extracting a piece of the Void and consuming it, but the Sentry refused to be taken into custody and escaped.{{r|Black Panther and the Agents of Wakanda Vol 1 1|2}}

====[[Annihilation - Scourge|Scourge of the Negative Zone]]====
Consequently, the Sentry sought out Mister Fantastic and begged him to free him from the Void forever. As there was no way to accomplish such a feature under the laws of their universe, Reed sent him to the [[Negative Zone]] in the hopes that he would succeed there.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Fantastic Four Vol 1 1}} Upon soaking up the negative cosmic rays, the Sentry separated from the Void but was left in the powerless form of Bob Reynolds, unable to transform into his superhero alter ego.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Silver Surfer Vol 1 1}} The explosion caused by their separation tore a hole in space that bridged the Negative Zone to the [[Earth-10011|Cancerverse]], a realm where nothing could die. As the Void shared a mutual interest with the Cancerverse forces,{{r|Annihilation - Scourge Omega Vol 1 1}} he became their apparent new leader, all while impersonating and taking on the appearance of the Sentry.

[[File:Annihilation - Scourge Omega Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Commanding the Cancerverse's army while impersonating the Sentry]]
Planning to return to his own universe to spread the Cancerverse's infection even further,{{r|Annihilation - Scourge Alpha Vol 1 1}} the Void tore a crack in reality made by [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]],{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Beta Ray Bill Vol 1 1}} who used it to escape to the Positive Zone and seek help,{{r|Annihilation - Scourge Alpha Vol 1 1}} into a rift with his bare hands. The Cancerverse forces tried to infect a planet near the rift, but [[Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616)|Beta Ray Bill]] stopped them at their tracks and sacrificed [[Stormbreaker|his hammer]] to trap the Void in the Negative Zone again before the rift closed itself.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Beta Ray Bill Vol 1 1}} While searching for the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]],{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Nova Vol 1 1}} who went to the Negative Zone with the rest of the Fantastic Four to help its inhabitants,{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Fantastic Four Vol 1 1}} the Void ended up finding [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] instead. He defeated the hero and handed him to the [[Revengers (Earth-10011)|Revengers]], but Nova managed to escape them before they were able to infect him again.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Nova Vol 1 1}}

After Reed Richards opened a portal to assemble the galaxy's greatest heroes against the Cancerverse, a group of heroes held the Void still so the Silver Surfer could merge Bob Reynolds to him again, returning the Sentry to his blackened form. They hoped that Bob would call off the invasion once in control, but that wasn't possible as the Void - who now shared control of Reynolds' body with the Sentry - wasn't truly the Cancerverse's leader and it was now hellbent on getting Nova back to the fold. With no other option, Nova attracted the Cancerverse's infection back to the tear it was coming from and swallowed it whole. The merged Sentry then killed Nova, thus ending the scourge and closing the rift. While all the other heroes returned to the Positive Zone, the Sentry remained behind to watch over the universe he almost killed.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge Omega Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Knull (Earth-616) and Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616) from King in Black Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|left|Assimilated by Knull]]
====[[King in Black (Event)|King in Black]]====
The Sentry was recalled to Earth to help fight [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] - the primordial dark god who had created the [[Symbiotes (Race)|symbiotes]] - and attempted to fly him into space and rip him in half as he once had [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]]. However, Knull easily overpowered the Sentry and ripped him apart. Unleashed from its mortal vessel, the Void submitted to Knull and was assimilated by him.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} After [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]] became the new host of the [[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|God of Light]] and turn into a cosmic version of Venom, he overpowered Knull. Using the Uni-Power, Venom destroyed Knull's body on the Sun and the living abyss inside of [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan Brock]] that tried to take over his body, seemingly defeating the dark god and the Void with him.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 5}}

| Powers                  = The Void - both as a part of the Sentry and a separate entity - possesses the following abilities:
* '''Molecular Manipulation:''' The Void possesses similar matter and energy manipulation abilities as the Sentry. Having used it to entrap the Avengers within an inescapable shroud of black matter he had conjured up, material easily able to hold the likes of Thor and Giant-Man with ease.{{r|Sentry Vol 1 1}} At its most focused i.e. through his tendrils, the Void can cause total atomic cancellation within a target, as he did when he disintegrated the immortal Loki.{{r|Siege Vol 1 4}}
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' The Void can heal himself from virtually all injuries.
* '''Immortality:''' For all intents and purposes, the Void cannot and will not ever truly die even long after being hurled into the sun both by Robert{{r|Sentry Vol 2 8}} and later killed by a bolt of lightning by Thor.{{r|Siege Vol 1 1}} That the dark aspect of the Sentry cannot expire in any sense, coming to be an existing entity all its own; it even left the chronically dying and regenerating body of its host while trapped in the sun.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 11}}
*'''Resurrection:''' The Void appears to be able to resurrect himself and to bring the dead back to life under extreme emotional distress.
* '''Superhuman Strength:''' The Void's physical abilities are a direct mirror reflection of his counterpart, though it's reputed that The Sentry is visibly stronger.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 8}} Despite that Void has enough physical power to easily man handle gods and monsters with little effort on his part, be it shattering the all but unbreakable bones of the Incredible Hulk{{r|Sentry Vol 2 3}} or even knocking around the Sentry through a host of carnival rides with relative ease.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 6}} He was even able to pry open an interdimensional portal linking the [[Earth-616|Posiverse]] and the Negative Zone with his bare hands.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Beta Ray Bill Vol 1 1}}
* '''Warping Speed:''' Void also boasts the ability to think, move, run, and react at beyond superhuman speeds. As a thought effigy born of living shadow, he may actually be faster than his good side.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 6}} The Dark Sentry can appear anywhere at any given time across the world and beyond with or without the Sentry knowing it, capable of moving and traveling thousands to trillions of miles at the drop of a hat before returning to his creators shattered psyche.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 8}}
* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Dark Sentry has an advanced musculature greater than that of any human and most known superhumans. Being a being of thought, his muscles produce no fatigue toxins, affording him all but unlimited physical stamina.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 8}}
* '''Superhuman Agility:''' Void's natural balance, agility, and body coordination are enhanced to levels that are far beyond the natural physical limits of even the finest human athlete.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 8}}
* '''Superhuman Reflexes:''' The Void can act and react at above superhuman speeds exceeding the equivalent of several times the speed of sound. As such, he/it is quick enough to match the highly adept Sentry in the art of superpowered fisticuffs with little difficulty.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 8}} Void is easily quick witted enough to counterattack Ares as he pounced on him from behind{{r|Siege Vol 1 2}} and is capable of battling whole scores of Marvel's superhuman community with ease and without so much as a wasted movement.{{r|{{cl|New Avengers Vol 1 9}}-[[New Avengers Vol 1 10|10]]}}
* '''Superhuman Senses:''' It, like the Sentry, is able to hear almost any sound at any decibel, pitch, and frequency. The only Earth creature who can detect sounds at the frequencies he can is a blue whale (0.01-200,000 Hz). He has shown enough control to block out ambient sounds to focus on a specific source/frequency (He has demonstrated hearing a butterfly's heartbeat in Africa). The range of his eyesight is also far greater than that of a human being. He is able to detect a single person from hundreds of miles in the air and above cloud level. The full extent of Void's other senses superhuman capabilities is unknown.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 1}} 
*'''Nigh-Invulnerability:''' The Void is, for all intents and purposes, almost completely impervious to harm.
** '''Sensory Scrying:''' The Void's senses are tied to those of the Sentry's senses. Everything Reynolds sees and does, it will know instantly.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 8}} 
** '''Clairvoyance:''' On its own, the Void also possesses extra sensory perception of unknown potency. Being more attuned with the world around him than just of the tangible spectrum, such as sensing if and when his human self has been disturbed by the presence of another force{{r|{{cl|New Avengers Vol 1 9}}-[[New Avengers Vol 1 10|10]]}} or ascertaining what Loki had done to empower the heroes standing against him.{{r|Siege Vol 1 4}}
* '''Psionics:''' The Void possesses telepathic, empathetic and possibly cyberpathic capabilities.{{r|Sentry/Hulk Vol 1 1}} The level of which being unknown but quite possibly rivaling that of the Sentry himself.{{r|Sentry/Spider-Man Vol 1 1}} Having once used such a facult of his powers to taunt his heroic self through a television screen. Showcasing some mildly impressive remote technological operation.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 6|8}}
* '''Flight:''' The Void also has the natural ability of aviation, used in conjunction with his superhuman speed to fly far above hyper sonic to trans-light speeds.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 6}} He can match Sentry in a contest of flight speed as well as sit stationary in mid-air if need be.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 33}}{{r|Siege Vol 1 3|4}} He can even fly at speeds high enough to outpace even a god of Asgard, battering him into near unconsciousness in a single stroke.{{r|Siege Vol 1 1}}
* '''Photokinesis:''' While a dark element, The Void in tandem with the Sentry often emitted light within darkness.
* '''Atmokinesis:''' The Void has massive control over the weather and can create destructive storms.
* '''Adaptive Appearance:''' The Void is a highly adept shapeshifter, constantly changing and alternating his appearance on the fly. With varying forms ranging from a shadowy, trench coat-wearing villain to a shell skinned mega beast, monstrous flame effigy, an obese pustule atrocity, or massive hurricane of darkness.{{r|{{cl|New Avengers Vol 1 9}}-[[New Avengers Vol 1 10|10]]}} He can even turn into a copy of the Sentry.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge Alpha Vol 1 1}}{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Silver Surfer Vol 1 1}}
* '''Adaptive Possession:''' The Void is capable of hosting most any individual he desires and endowing them with his powers, as he did with Dr. Strange during his battle with Loki over his title of Sorcerer Supreme.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 1 384|385}}
* '''Infini-Tendrils:''' The Void can create deadly infini-tendrils. Those impaled on these tendrils experience traumatic visions of the past, present, and future. The Tendrils are also capable of causing physical damage, for example when they broke every bone in the body of the Hulk.
* '''Umbrakinesis:''' The Void has massive control over darkness.
** '''Army Creation:''' The Void could create soldiers to form a shadow army.{{r|Black Panther and the Agents of Wakanda Vol 1 1|2}}
* '''Ultimate Intangibility:''' Sentry's dark personality can physically change and alternate molecular/atomic density and cohesion in order to phase through objects and people while inflicting tremendous pain on a subject.{{r|Siege Vol 1 4}}
* '''Night Augmentation:''' The Void is at his strongest during the night.
* '''[[Negative Zone]] Augmentation:''' The Void's powers increase to maximum whenever he is inside the Negative Zone.{{r|{{cl|Sentry Vol 2 2}}-[[Sentry Vol 2 3|3]]}}
*'''Biokinesis:''' Like its counterpart the Sentry, the Void has an as of yet untapped capacity to affect organic matter in undisclosed but seemingly unlimited ways. The Void persona uses such attributes to malignant ends, while his lighter half acclimates more beneficial ones. Its power over such aspects is so great that the Void afflicted a women with breast cancer a world away.{{r|Sentry Vol 2 6|8}}

| Notes                   = * Void does not seem to have a defined form as such, being only an amorphous entity.
* Although they have similarities with the [[Symbiotes (Race)|symbiotes]], it is not clear that they have an origin related to them and that there are other beings similar to Void in the universe.
| Trivia                  = * The exact nature of the Void is unclear, as while it is intrinsically linked to the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]], it has existed as a separate entity on multiple occasions and was referred to by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] as the [[Angels (Monotheism)|Biblical angel]] of death.{{r|Siege Vol 1 4}}
** [[Lindy Lee (Earth-616)|Lindy Reynolds]], the Sentry's wife, had a theory that Bob accidentally opened himself up to something of Biblical proportions when he drank the drug that gave him his powers, even going as far as to identify this something as possibly being [[Yahweh (Earth-616)|God]]. She, however, had no proof of it and thought it crazy, though the Void mockingly told Robert her theory was indeed true.{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 13}}
* Despite the Void having displayed some [[Symbiotes (Race)|symbiote]]-like traits - such as appearing as a monster with fanged jaws, claws, and tentacles made of darkness,{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 15}} and bonding to Dr. Strange to fight Loki - [[Donny Cates]] has stated that it is not a creation of [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]].{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1127000132170452995|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: "Whole separate thing. Not related at all. I don't plot around puns. Well, not anymore I don't. #ThePaybacks"|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=May 10, 2019|accessdate=May 11, 2019}}}} Despite this, in {{cl|King in Black Vol 1 1}}, the Void was shown being controlled by and bonding to Knull much like a symbiote, with Knull boasting that the Void serves him.
* [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|The Sentry]] not being in his dark form in {{cl|King in Black Vol 1 1}} is a continuity error owing to Donny Cates and Ryan Stegman not having been aware of his fusion with the Void at the time the issue was written and illustrated, and Marvel's editorial department not correcting it prior to publication.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0Xkc9pA3CQ|title=TALKIN' KING IN BLACK ISSUE 1!|work=YouTube|first=|last=StegmanAndFriends|date=December 4, 2020|accessdate=December 5, 2020}}}}
