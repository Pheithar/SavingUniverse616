===Origin===
[[File:Atlas (Titan) (Earth-616) from from Incredible Hercules Vol 1 123 0001.jpg|thumb|right|350px]]
After the [[Olympians]] defeated the [[Titans (Olympians)|Titans]], [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus]] sent out two eagles to mark the boundaries of his dominion: where they met was declared the center of the world. It was there he condemned the General of the Titans, [[Atlas (Titan) (Earth-616)|Atlas]], to hold the Heavens aloft as the [[Axis Mundi (Cosmic Axis)|Axis Mundi, the world Axis]]. The continent where he stood was christened "Atlantis" which simply meant the "Isle of Axis".{{r|Incredible Hercules #123}}

===Ancient Atlantis (20,000 to 18,000 BC)===

}}
Originally, Atlantis was a land of barbarians, one of whom, [[Kull (Earth-616)|Kull]], left and acquired the throne of the nearby kingdom of [[Valusia (Kingdom)|Valusia]]. The Atlanteans were warriors and hunters, divided into various autonomous tribes. They were often at conflict with the seven "civilized" kingdoms of the Pre-Cataclysmic era (Valusia, Grondar, Commoria, Thule, Verulla, Kamelia, and the Triple Federation), with the islanders of the [[Pictish Isles]], and with the pirates of [[Lemuria (Deviant)|Lemuria]].{{r|Handbook of the Conan Universe  #1}}
[[File:Atlantis from from Incredible Hercules Vol 1 123 0001.jpg|thumb|374px|right]]
Atlantis became the center of a small empire of sailors, craftsmen, traders, astrologers and alchemists. Atlantean sea vessels reached as far as [[Antarctica]] where they discovered the [[Savage Land]]; which they named [[Pangea (Savage Land)|Pangea]] (meaning "paradise"). They exported exotic and otherwise extinct animals across the empire.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1|; [[Atlantis]] entry}}

Atlantean alchemists created the [[Serpent Crown]], a vessel empowered by the demonic Elder God [[Set (Earth-616)|Set]]. The Serpent Crown is one of the few artifacts of ancient Atlantis crew survived until modern times. Few historical personages of the Atlantean age are known to date. One of the few is Kull, the barbarian-king who ruled Atlantis about 500 years before it sank. Kull was renowned as the slayer of the arch wizard [[Thulsa Doom (Earth-616)|Thulsa Doom]], and was the enemy of the Serpent People, nonhuman but humanoid offspring of Set.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1|; [[Atlantis]] entry}}

According to some accounts, one of the inhabitants of Pre-Cataclysmic Atlantis was a woman called [[Cleito]], the daughter of Evenor. Cleito mated with [[Poseidon Aegaeus (Earth-616)|Poseidon]] and give birth to five sets of twins, who ruled the ten provinces of Atlantis. It is uncertain how this information ties in with what else we know of ancient Atlantis.{{r|Man-Thing Vol 3 8}}
 
===[[Great Cataclysm]] (18,000 BC)===
[[File:Atlantis from from Incredible Hercules Vol 1 123 0002.jpg|right|thumb|300px]]
The last years of ancient Atlantis sought direction of the giant glass-like dome over the capital city of the empire (also called Atlantis). Its last rulers were [[Kamuu (Ancient Atlantis) (Earth-616)|King Kamuu]] and his wife [[Zartra (Ancient Atlantis) (Earth-616)|Queen Zartra]], a native of the Lemurian Isles, which had been conquered by the non-human race of [[Deviants (Race)|Deviants]]. The Atlantean empire had been in a state of decline after Kull's era. The empire was reeling with civil war in all of its provinces and the fighting kept encroaching closer and closer to the capital city. Finally barbarians from the Lemurian Isles attacked Atlantis on behalf of the Deviant Empire, and to rout their forces King Kamuu opened the magma pits, which were the city's means of heating. The Lemurian invaders were destroyed by the molten lava, but due to unprecedented volcanic pressure beneath the city, the magma release triggered a seismological cataclysm. First the capital city, and then the entire continent of Atlantis itself was racked by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. At the same time, the Deviants themselves launched the attack on the surviving Second Host of the alien [[Celestials]]. The Celestials retaliated by causing a nuclear cataclysm, which sank [[Lemuria (Pacific Ocean)|Lemuria]] and created shockwaves that shook the entire world. As a result of the local geological convulsions and the after effects of the Lemurian cataclysm, the entire continent of Atlantis fragmented and vanished beneath the Atlantic Ocean in about a week.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1|; [[Atlantis]] entry}}

===First Atlantis: R'llyeh===
According to legend, following the Cataclysm, beings from the stars{{r|Vampires: The Marvel Undead #1|; [[Aqueos]]' entry}} (that had been dormant for eons, but awoke when some of Atlantis' humans returned to the seas as [[Homo mermanus|water-breathers]]){{r|Namor: The First Mutant #3}} created the first [[Aqueos]] from Sh'g'th tissue.{{r|Namor: The First Mutant #4}}{{r|Vampires: The Marvel Undead #1|; [[Aqueos]]' entry}} The Aqueos city of [[R'llyeh]] was rumored to be the "First Atlantis", and the source of all magic.{{r|Vampires: The Marvel Undead #1|; [[Aqueos]]' entry}}

===[[Hyborian Age]] (18,000 BC to 10,000 BC)===
Fortunately, there were a few survivors of the Atlantean catastrophe. The largest concentration of survivors was in the southern city of Netheria, whose priests and intellectuals foresaw an attack by the Lemurians. They enclosed their small city in the dome of an unknown plastic like substance, and excavated and fortified their cityâ€™s foundation. Consequently, when the continent of Atlantis fragmented, Netheria remained intact as it sank, coming to rest in a huge sub-sea cavern. Finding a way to recycle their air supply, the Netherians renamed their realm the [[Netheria|Netherworld]]. The Netherworld, now under the rule of Queen [[Kala (Earth-616)|Kala]], exists today.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1|; [[Atlantis]] entry}}

Tiny bands of Atlanteans managed to find refuge on neighboring islands and the European continent, which were buffeted by the Atlantis catastrophe but not destroyed. One group of refugees fled to Antillia, a group of islands nearby. Other Atlanteans in Europe eventually became the tribes of [[Cimmeria]], which the man known as [[Conan (Earth-616)|Conan the Barbarian]] would later come from.{{r|Handbook of the Conan Universe  #1}} The nearby island of [[Attilan]], home of the genetically advanced but reclusive [[Inhomo supremis|Inhumans]], also survived the cataclysm virtually unscathed.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1|; [[Atlantis]] entry}}

===8,000 BC: Home of the ''Homo mermanus''===
About 10,000 years ago, a new type of human beings, ''[[Homo mermanus]]'', appeared in the Atlantic Ocean possessing gills to breathe underwater, however the origins of are lost. The capacity to breathe underwater, found prior to this time in certain individuals of both the Inhuman and Deviant races, may have been scientifically bestowed upon members of mainstream humanity by Inhuman or Deviant geneticists. The legends of the water breathers themselves credit [[Poseidon Aegaeus (Earth-616)|Neptune]], god of the sea worshipped by the Greeks and Romans, with their transformation from air to water-breathers.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1|; [[Atlantis]] entry}}<!-- to be corrected or tied to the homo mermanus/vodani page -->

For millennia, the tribe of ''Homo mermanus'' were nomadic, wandering the Atlantic Ocean, preying upon small fish for food, using shells of huge crustaceans for shelter, and developing nothing but the most rudimentary tool-making culture.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1|; [[Atlantis]] entry}}

===6,000 BC: Atlantis foundation and Kamuu's rule===
''That event was also presented as occurring 3,000 years after the cataclysm, circa 15,000 BC,''{{r|Marvel Saga the Official History of the Marvel Universe  Vol 1 #1}}'' or 5,000 years after the cataclysm, circa 13,000 BC.''{{r|Sub-Mariner #64|; Takes of Atlantis}}<br>
Circa 6,000 BC, about 12,000 years after the cataclysm,{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  A to Z #1|; Atlantis' entry}} the undersea tribes discovered the ruins of the capital city of ancient Atlantis. The prince of the Sea People, named [[Kamuu (Atlantean) (Earth-616)|Kamuu]] after the legendary surface Atlantean ruler, happened upon the throne of his ancient namesake. Upon recovering the original Kamuu's sword, he was visited by the spirit of the last king of ancient Atlantis. The spirit of King Kamuu bade his water-breathing namesake to settle here on the site of old Atlantis and found a new Atlantis. The young Kamuu convinced people to settle, and they began to build a new city of Atlantis.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1|; [[Atlantis]] entry}}<!-- tp be completed with the war between the western and eastern seas -->

The undersea city of Atlantis fell victim to natural disasters and sieges by barbarian tribes over the next few millennia, but each time Atlantis was rebuilt in even greater splendor.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1|; [[Atlantis]] entry}}

===5,800 BC: Harran and Suma-Ket's rules===
Kamuu's son [[Harran (Earth-616)|Harran]] became king of Atlantis{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  A to Z #11|; [[Suma-Ket (Earth-616)|Suma-Ket]]'s entry}} after his father's death.<!-- {{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #38}} -->

In the third decade after Kamuu's death,{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #38}} circa 5,800 BC, the mid-Atlantic city of Atlantis was besieged by the [[Faceless Ones]]. Leading the [[Unforgiven Dead (Earth-616)|Unforgiven Dead]], [[Suma-Ket (Earth-616)|Suma-Ket]] magically banished the monsters in exchange for his people settling in Atlantis. In awe to Suma-Ket's powers and battle prowess, the Atlanteans slew Harran and proclaimed Ket Atlantis' king in place.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  A to Z #11|; [[Suma-Ket (Earth-616)|Suma-Ket]]'s entry}}

...<!-- tyrannical reign, sacrifice, Dark gods (Old Ones)... -->{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  A to Z #11|; [[Suma-Ket (Earth-616)|Suma-Ket]]'s entry}}

===Kalen's return===
Kamuu's grandson [[Kalen (Earth-616)|Kalen]], bearer of the [[sacred armor of Atlantis]], returned from a long journey. He rallied the Atlanteans who, aided by Atlantis' patron god [[Poseidon Aegaeus (Earth-616)|Neptune]], defeated the forces of Suma-Ket in a bloody battle. As the Unforgiven Dead couldn't be destroyed, the lords of Atlantis banished Ket's court to the [[Grey Waters]], a mystical prison beyond the [[Earthly plane]].{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  A to Z #11|; [[Suma-Ket (Earth-616)|Suma-Ket]]'s entry}}

===5,500 BC; Lemuria foundation===
About 500 years after the founding of undersea Atlantis, a group of ''Homo mermanus'' left the city and made their way to the Pacific Ocean. This group founded the city of Lemuria on the opposite end of the now submerged continent of Lemuria from that settled by the Deviants. Due to the acquisition and worship of the [[Serpent Crown]], the magical artifacts from the pre-cataclysmic Atlantis, the Lemurians' complexions and features have taken a more serpentine cast than their Atlanteans forebears.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1|; [[Atlantis]] entry}}

Little is known about Atlanteans history between the time of the founding of [[Lemuria (Pacific Ocean)|Lemuria]] and the modern era. The Atlanteans' historical records, graven in stone until the relatively recent invention of a paper-like substance made from seaweed, had been all but lost in the dark ages of Atlantean history. The god Neptune is believed to have dwelt among the Atlanteans in mortal form during this period, promoting his worship, a practice that continues today. The Atlanteans also encountered Deviant refugees at some time in the past 200 years, and it was from them that they learned the rudiments of technology. The Atlanteans had very limited contact with their surface-dwelling parent race until recent times. This was largely due to the fact that neither water-breathers nor air-breathers could survive outside of their native environment for more than minutes without drowning.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1|; [[Atlantis]] entry}}

===5,000 BC: War with Athens===
Circa 5,000 BC (seventy centuries ago), [[Athens (Greece)|Athens]] and Atlantis were at war. [[Kam'u (Earth-616)|Lord Kam'u]] of Atlantis attempted to make peace by sending emissaries to appeal for trade between the two countries, in order to feed their starving masses. The [[Athenians]] instead butchered the emissaries' bodies and invaded his realm, causing Kam'u to strike back.{{r|Namor: The First Mutant #2}} He allegedly eventually let his people down (and ended up in [[Hell]] after his death).{{r|Namor: The First Mutant #6}}

===Undisclosed time events===
Some events and periods occurred in Atlantis haven't been given a proper temporal settling as far<!-- (though it is fair to assume they occurred in the time fitting this paragraph-->:
* During his rule, [[Zalphir (Earth-616)|Zalphir]]<!-- , --><!-- {{r|Namor: The First Mutant #6}} --><!-- the Iron Scorpion,{{r|Namor: The First Mutant #8}} --> helped his people survive a century of captivity. He allegedly eventually let his people down (and ended up in [[Hell]] after his death).<!-- {{r|Namor: The First Mutant #6}} -->
* During his rule, [[Hensel (Earth-616)|Hensel]] presided over five bloody wars. He allegedly eventually let his people down (and ended up in Hell after his death).{{r|Namor: The First Mutant #6}}
* [[Rithea (Earth-616)|Rithea]] was the only female emperor in [[Atlantean History]]. She ended up in Hell after her death,{{r|Namor: The First Mutant #7}} presumably having eventually let her people down.

===15th century===
During the rule of [[Thallo (Earth-616)|Thallo]], the scientist [[Kyral (Earth-616)|Kyral]] developed a cloning process which could be used to grow and develop food. The process was eventually stolen and then used to create a slave race for the Atlantean people. This lasted for many years, until a rebel slave known as [[Delta Nine (Earth-616)|Delta Nine]] led a rebellion to gain freedom and equal rites for his people. At this point, Thallo ordered the death of all the slaves, and outlawed cloning.{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner #20}}{{citation}}{{Verify source}}

===18th or early 19th centuries===
<!-- In the 18th or early 19th centuries, -->[[Immanu (Earth-616)|Emperor Immanu]] ordered the [[Amra (Atlantean) (Earth-616)|Royal Logomancer Amra]] to create a spell to destroy the [[Aqueos]]. The spell remained incomplete for decades, though enhanced and adjusted by subsequent logomancers.{{r|Vampires: The Marvel Undead #1|; [[Aqueos]]' entry}}

===19th and early 20th centuries===
Circa 1847,{{r|Vampires: The Marvel Undead #1|; [[Thakorr (Earth-616)|Thakorr]]'s entry}} Atlantis was attacked by hordes of undersea barbarians haling from the nearby province of Skarka. Although the Atlanteans managed to repel the invasions, the city of Atlantis sustained heavy damages. [[Thakorr (Earth-616)|Emperor Thakorr]], who ascended the throne after former King Immanu died in battle with the barbarians, resolved to move the capital city of the empire from its traditional site. He led the Atlantean populace south, where they founded a [[Atlantis (Tha-Korr)|new Atlantis]] in [[Southern Ocean]] not far from the continent of [[Antarctica]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1}}{{Verify source}}<!-- slightly different information: {{r|Vampires: The Marvel Undead #1|; [[Thakorr (Earth-616)|Thakorr]]' entry}} -->

The Atlanteans lived in peace there until the 1920s, when an American ship was sent to Antarctica to clear a path through the icebergs. The detonation of explosive depth charges rocked the undersea city, killing a tenth of its inhabitants.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1}} Thakorr bade his daughter [[Fen (Earth-616)|Fen]] to assign a scouting party to investigate the attack. The adventurous Fen decided to go herself. Fen learned that the bombardment was not an act of war, and became romantically attracted to the ship's captain, [[Leonard McKenzie (Earth-616)|Leonard McKenzie]]. The American and Atlantean were soon wed and Fen later gave birth to [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], a [[Homo Superior|mutant]] hybrid of the two races. Most of McKenzie's crew were slain by the Atlanteans, who believed they held Fen captive.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe  Vol 2 1}}

====1920s to 1930s====
When Namor was still a young child, the [[Atlantean Royal Family (Earth-616)|Atlantean Royal Family]] and their citizens moved to a new [[Atlantis (Pacific)|Atlantis]] off the Pacific Northwestern coast of the [[United States of America]]. It was their that they established trade negotiations with humans and aided in underwater oil mining operations. When an oil rig was damaged, the city had to be abandoned due to the oil spill.{{r|Namor #1|12}}

===[[World War II]]===
[[File:Fantastic Four Vol 1 4 page 13 Atlantis.jpg|thumb|325px|right]]
====1939====
The first declaration of war against the surface dwellers occurred in late 1939, when the Sub-Mariner had one of his early encounters with surface dwellers who were diving in the deep. His grandfather, Emperor Thakorr and his mother Princess Fen authorized Namor to engage in hostilities against the surface world.{{r|Marvel Comics #1}}

====1940====
After his initial attack on [[New York City]], the Sub-Mariner was convinced by police woman [[Betty Dean (Earth-616)|Betty Dean]] to focus his aggression toward the Nazis who were attempting to conquer the world. Namor then returned to his home land to get the assistance of his people. Emperor Thakorr agreed with this course of action and Atlantis officially entered into the war. The Atlantean military constructed a fleet to Aero-Subs, submarines that also had flight capabilities. The first Atlantean campaign against the Nazis was a strike against Nazi U-Boats in the Atlantic Ocean in the Northern Sea, off the coast of [[Norway]]. The attack helped liberate supply boats heading to the United States.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #4}}

However, this initial campaign proved to be short lived as the Sub-Mariner soon renewed his aggressions against the surface dwellers, and the United States in particular shortly thereafter. Following an attack on New York City, Namor returned to Atlantis. Shortly after Namor's return the kingdom was attacked by [[Luther Robinson (Earth-616)|Luther Robinson]] and [[Lynne Harris (Earth-616)|Lynn Harris]] who commissioned a battleship to attack Atlantis in retaliation for Namor's aggressions against the United States.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #10}} The battle was won by the people of Atlantis, and both Robinson and Harris were taken prisoner and were to be executed for their attack, but the Sub-Mariner ultimately freed them.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #11}} However, Princess Fen intended Lynne Harris to be Namor's bride, and so the Sub-Mariner was ordered to bring Lynne back. Lynne then underwent a surgery, turning her into an amphibian, but she was soon rescued by Luther and the couple escaped from Atlantis once more.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #12}}

Following the Robinson attack on Atlantis, the Sub-Mariner decided to once more fight against the Nazis. He and [[Dorma (Earth-616)|Lady Dorma]] then returned to the surface world where they clashed with Nazi forces on a French owned island{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #13}} and at a hidden U-Boat base located near the [[Florida Keys]].{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #14}}

====1941====
By royal decree, Namor ventured to New York City and captured Luther Robinson and Lynne Harris and forced them to return to Atlantis.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #15}} This kidnapping later led to Betty Dean gathering her [[Legion of Loyalists (Earth-616)|Legion of Loyalists]] together to attack Atlantis and free Luther and Lynne, clashing with Atlantean forces.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #18}} Namor also ordered the first Atlantis incursion against the [[Imperial Japan (Earth-616)|Imperial Japanese]] when they attempted to invade [[Alaska (State)|Alaska]] through a tunnel dug under the Berring Straight from [[Siberia]].{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #17}} However, when Namor went after them he once more clashed with Nazi forces and then agreed to let them all go.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #19}}

Angered by the constant interference of Atlantis in the war, Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Adolf Hitler]] ordered an assault on Atlantis.{{r|Saga of the Sub-Mariner #5}} This attack caused massive destruction of Atlantis, however the Sub-Mariner led his fellow Atlanteans on a counter-attack, ending the invasion. One account suggests that Emperor Thakorr was slain in the battle{{r|Sub-Mariner Comics #1}} however, it has been stated that Thakorr was gravely injured and placed into a coma.{{r|Saga of the Sub-Mariner #5}} In either case, Namor was installed as the new ruler of Atlantis. Shortly after his ascension to the throne, a plague hit Atlantis, threatening to wipe out the entire population. Namor ventured to the surface world once more and obtained the required radium to cure the illness.{{r|Sub-Mariner Comics #1}}

Soon after the war on the surface world once more touched Atlantis, the collateral damage of sea warfare decimating much of the kingdom. The Sub-Mariner was convinced by an Atlantean named [[Rathia (Earth-616)|Rathia]] to enter into an alliance with other sea dwelling races and conquer the surface world. Enticed with dreams of conquest, Namor quickly formed an alliance with the [[Seal People|Seal]], [[Shark Men|Shark]] and [[Walrus Men|Walrus]] people and launched an all out attack on surface continents. The powers of the world were too busy in the global war to anticipate such an attack, and Atlantis succeeded in flooding countries such as [[Africa]], [[Germany]], and [[Russia]]. The only opposition Namor and his invading army came from the Sub-Mariner's sometime ally the [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and his partner [[Thomas Raymond (Earth-616)|Toro]]. However, Namor briefly incapacitated his foes, leaving Toro recovering from hypothermia in [[London (England)|London]], and the Torch briefly under Namor's control. The Torch was used to melt glaciers to increase flooding, but the hero eventually broke free. By this time Atlantis had launched an attack on New York City, striking it with a massive flood.{{r|Human Torch #5 (Fall)}} The Sub-Mariner clashed with the Human Torch in New York City, and was defeated with the assistance of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Marvels Project #6}}

During his absence from Atlantis, Namor's position was taken over by his uncle [[Daka (Earth-616)|Daka]]. Daka had those who were opposed to him, including Princess Fen and Lady Dorma, locked up. Daka then forged an alliance wit the Seal People and the Nazis and plotted an invasion of North and South America, starting with [[Argentina]]. However, Namor returned home and freed Daka's prisoners and led a rebellion to stop this invasion. The Atlantean-Seal People-Nazi alliance was smashed quickly by Namor's resistance and the prime conspirators were then turned over to the Argentinian authorities. Namor then returned to Atlantis with is position of power restored.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #24}}

====1942====
In late 1941 and early 1942, Atlantis took its first act against Imperial Japan following the attack on Wake Island. An Atlantean force led by the Sub-Mariner uncovered a secret Japanese prison beneath the island, slaying it's leader [[Colonel Yama (Earth-616)|Colonel Yama]].{{r|Human Torch #7}} Shortly thereafter, Namor and Atlantean engineers developed the submarine [[SM-1]], which Namor used to assist [[Australia|Australian]] forces in defending their shores from the Japanese. Although the SM-1 was destroyed, Namor succeeded in driving back Japanese forces.{{r|Sub-Mariner Comics #5}}

Shortly after this incident, Princess Fen decreed that the Atlanteans should once more focus on the Nazis in Europe and ordered Namor to lead a squad of Atlantean soldiers to assist the Free French resistance in [[France]]. To this end, Namor and his soldiers provided the Free French with munitions to battle their Nazi oppressors giving them a much needed assist in the eventual liberation of France.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #30}} However, Namor soon refocused his efforts on the Japanese in retaliation for the attacks on Pearl Harbour, allying his army with the United States military in battles along the Pacific.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #31}} With the constant interference of Atlantis in the war, the Nazis had their minion [[Pfeiffer Kornstalk (Earth-616)|Commander Kornstalk]] try to convince Namor to ally Atlantis with the Nazis. Namor refused, and the Nazis retaliated by contaminating the waters around Atlantis with copper. With the people of Atlantis facing extinction from the "copper plague", Namor surrendered to the Nazis and agreed to assist them in their war effort. However, Princess Fen led a resistance movement to attack Kornstalk's underwater base and destroy the devices polluting their waters, slaying Kornstalk in the process.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #37}}

====1943-1944====
Atlantis was nearly annihilated when Hitler once more ordered it's destruction in 1943. He sent his minions [[Admiral von Roeder (Earth-616)|Admiral von Roeder]] and [[Oskar Kessler (Earth-616)|Oskar Kessler]] attack Atlantis with an army of manned robots. Once again, Namor came to the aid of his people and assisted them in destroying all the invaders.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #41}} Atlantis suffered another attack by Nazi forces that learned the location of the domain by forcing a pair of Atlantean fishermen to reveal it to them. After devastating the area, they fled to Antarctica where they were defeated by the Sub-Mariner.{{r|Daring Comics #9}} Throughout the remainder of the war, Atlantis remained mostly uninvolved with the conflict, with Namor acting alone against both Nazi and Japanese forces until the end of the war.

===Post-World War II===
====1945-49====
Thakorr awoke from his longtime coma, and furious that Namor assisted the surface world in his absence, exiled Namor from Atlantis for a time.{{r|Saga of the Sub-Mariner #4}} In 1947, Atlantis was attacked by [[Brian Richards (Earth-616)|Stoop Richards]] and his gang, with Namor coming to the aid of his people. Among the survivors of the attack was his cousin [[Aquaria Neptunia (Earth-616)|Namora]] who joined Namor as his crime-fighting sidekick during his exile.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #82}} Eventually, Thakkor lifted the exile from Namor and he was allowed to return home.{{r|Saga of the Sub-Mariner #4}} 

====1950's====
Atlantis mainly kept to themselves during the early 1950s, it was not until Namor was called back to the surface world near the end of 1953 and continued his adventures on the surface world. His activities against communist nations made Atlantis a target of reprisals. Although Namor was exiled for a brief period, he helped save his people and Thakorr once more removed Namor from his exile.{{r|Young Men #28}} Sometime later in 1954, Thakorr's step-son [[Byrrah (Earth-616)|Byrrah]] convinced Thakorr to allow him to attack the surface world, and Atlantis launched an attack on South America. Namor, siding with the surface world in order to prevent further bloodshed, led his fellow Atlanteans into a trap so they were forced to retreat. Furiously Thakorr exiled Namor once again.{{r|Sub-Mariner Comics #35}} However when the [[Lunarians]] briefly stole the Earth's surface supply of water, the people of Atlantis faced extinction, but were saved when Namor returned Earth's water and his exile was lifted. Byrrah later tricked Atlantean forces to going to war against North America, using ice bergs to cause massive damage, this attempt was also thwarted by the Sub-Mariner.{{r|Sub-Mariner Comics #36}} Atlantis later came to the aid of the surface world, led by Namor and Namora, to rescue it from the aliens known as the [[Unseen (Aliens)|Unseen]] and their communist benefactors.{{r|Sub-Mariner Comics #37}}

Throughout the remainder of the 1950s, Atlantis remained uninvolved in any conflicts. The nation almost went to war with the surface world again when Namor foolishly attacked an exploration ship searching for Uranium in the region. When Namor realized their intentions he allowed them to continued their course. The explorers then warned the people of Atlantis of an impending undersea earthquake, allowing the Atlantean people to flee while their kingdom was devastated by the quake, however they quickly rebuilt.{{r|Sub-Mariner #40}} Shortly thereafter, Atlantis sought to become a member of the United Nations and sent Namor as an emissary to New York to petition for membership. However Namor became a target of bigotry and was forced to retreat. It was then decreed by Emperor Thakorr that the Atlantean people with withdraw from the surface world and live in the peace and anonymity of the ocean.{{r|Saga of the Sub-Mariner #4}} However this peace was broken when Namor encountered [[Destiny (Paul Destine)|Paul Destine]], an American who unearthed the [[Serpent Crown|Helmet of Power]] from the Antarctic hiding place where band of [[Lemurians (Homo mermanus)|Lemurians]] had buried it. Destine use the Crown to amplify his natural psionic powers and as an exercise of power, destroyed the nearby [[Atlantis (Tha-Korr)|Atlantis (Tha-Korr)]] with a mental blast. Namor's grandfather Thakorr and mother Fen were among the many casualties of Atlantis' destruction. Namor was rendered amnesiac by a blast of Destine's power, and wandered the surface world for decades.{{r|Sub-Mariner #1}}

The Atlantean people disbursed across the ocean, with a major sect being ruled by [[Byrrah (Earth-616)|Byrrah]], the Emperor's stepson. He allowed for a search for Namor for the next six years.{{r|Marvel: The Lost Generation #3}}

In 1958, Emperor Thakorr led Atlantean troops against the [[Aqueos]], but was seemingly killed, while the sole Atlantean survivor was a woman who became known as the [[Oudvrou (Earth-616)|Oudvrou]]. Thakorr was in fact vampirized and became the Aqueos Highlord. rom then, the "Shallow Peace" was established between the races, though the Aqueos kept silently raiding Atlantis, rarely witnessed, to satiate themselves.{{r|Vampires: The Marvel Undead #1|; [[Aqueos]]' entry}}

====1960's====
The search for Namor was called off in 1961 by Byrrah.{{r|Marvel: The Lost Generation #3}} Byrrah led his people to the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean on the continent of Atlantis to establish a new [[Atlantis (Byrrah)|Atlantis]].{{r|Saga of the Sub-Mariner #7}}

[[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Doctor Druid]] also encountered a sect of Atlanteans and ventured to what he called 'The Lost City of Atlantis.' However, the race he encountered were fish-like humanoids and not the ''Homo mermanus'' race. It's possible they were another city of the continent of Atlantis that survived the cataclysm and adapted to living under water. Their city was not protected by a dome like the [[Netheria|Netherworld]], but was, however, hidden from the world by a 'submerged mountain' that served as a portal to the outside world. Doctor Droom thwarted a hostage situation by the Atlanteans and a further attack by hypnotizing the entire city into thinking the land above was barren, so there was no reason to venture up there. He also avoided any further knowledge of the situation by hypnotizing the hostages to forget the whole incident.{{r|Amazing Adventures #2}}

===Modern Atlantis===

Eventually, Namor was reunited with his people, and was crowned prince of the newest incarnation of [[Atlantis (Byrrah)|Atlantis]]. With the surface world learning of the existence of ''Homo mermanus'', Atlantis was subjected to ever more tumultuous fortunes. Three times did Atlantis declare war on the surface world and bring troops into [[Manhattan]] Island, only to withdraw them before casualties were sustained.{{Citation}} Namor even petitioned the [[United Nations]] to accept Atlantis into its organization and was rejected on more than one occasion. Following the death of his betrothed, Lady Dorma, Namor abdicated the throne of Atlantis for a time. In his absence, Atlantis was besieged by barbarians and plunderers. Before long, the Atlanteans begged Namor to return to the throne and he agreed. The Atlanteans were then the victims of accidental nerve gas poisoning, leaving thousands of ''Homo mermanus'' who dwelled in the capital city in a death-like coma. When Namor had exhausted other possible sources of aid, he turned to his one-time ally, the power hungry [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]].{{Citation}} Namor agreed to serve Doom for a time if Doom would use his scientific expertise to revive the Atlanteans. Both parties upheld their end of the bargain, and the Atlanteans were revived. For a time, the Atlanteans revered Namor for his role in their resuscitation with such fervor that it rankled him. Sometime later, however, the ruling council of the Atlanteans assessed Namor's leadership, evaluated the impact of his continual leaves of absence from the kingdom, and voted that Namor give up his role. Namor reluctantly agreed. The city of Atlantis and its small empire of colonies was then ruled by [[Vashti Cleito-Son (Earth-616)|Lord Vashti]].{{r|Prince Namor the Sub-Mariner #4}}

The entire continent of Atlantis was brought to the surface by [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]], resulting in untold deaths of Atlanteans.{{r|[[Atlantis Rising]]}} Many of the survivors moved to establish the newest Atlantis in [[Maritanis]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 124}}

For a time, most Atlanteans lived near San Francisco in [[New Atlantis (Atlantean Pillar)|New Atlantis]]{{r|Uncanny X-Men #520}} until it was destroyed.{{r|AvX: Consequences #4}}

[[File:Atlantis from Nick Fury Vol 1 4 003.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Atlantis celebrating its reconstruction]]
Atlantis met its end at the hands of the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-616)|Squadron Supreme]], a violent vigilante group willing to protect the Earth at all costs. Because of Namor's invasions to the surface world, they determined the Atlantean king and his kingdom had to be neutralized. Not too long before killing Namor, [[Marcus Milton (Earth-13034)|Hyperion]] lifted up Atlantis from the ocean and threw it on the land. In order to show mercy, Hyperion gave the Atlanteans some time to evacuate before forcefully crashing their city.{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 4 1}} Following Namor's resurrection,{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 4 12}} Atlantis was rebuilt, fueling its citizens with the optimism that the city could enjoy a bright new era.{{r|Nick Fury #4}}

===Atlantean Execution===
Atlantean execution consists of the accused being chained eagle spread to a pillar somewhere on the outskirts of Atlantis where their wrists and ankles are sliced leaving them to bleed out or be eaten alive by any nearby sharks. This form of punishment was never practiced by Namor however, Tydeus was executed as such under the brief rule of [[Byrrah (Earth-616)|Prince Byrrah]] after Namor fell deathly ill due to a conspiracy between Byrtah and [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] to poison Namor with a deadly virus created by Doom himself.{{citation}}

===[[Earth-90214]]===
Atlantis is accurately described word-for-word from the first recorded accounts by the Greek philosopher, [[Plato (Earth-90214)|Plato]]. The city was located just beside the Pillars of Hercules - known today as the Strait of Gibraltar - and was shockingly advanced for its period in the ancient world, including irrigated canals, marble-built architecture, and hanging gardens. Also, Atlantis possessed the secret power source, Orichalcum, which powered the entire city. However, the Atlanteans were unable to control the Orichalcum as its power was far too great for a superconductor, and eventually creating a vortex that sucked the entirety of Atlantis under the sea.{{r|Iron Man Noir #2}}
