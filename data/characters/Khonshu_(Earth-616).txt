===Origin===
'''Chons''', better known as '''Khonshu''', was said to be the son of [[Atum (Earth-616)|Atum (known to the Egyptian gods as Ammon Ra)]] and of [[Amaunet (Earth-616)|Amaunet]], air goddess of the [[Ogdoad]] pantheon.{{r|{{cl|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #1}}; Khonshu's entry}} Another account stated that Khonshu was in fact the adopted son of Amon Ra.{{r|Moon Knight #188}}<!-- {{r|Moon Knight #189}} states "father" but without precision -->

He was the brother of [[Montu (Earth-616)|Montu]],{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; Khonshu's entry}} and possibly [[Bes (Earth-616)|Bes]] and [[Ptah (Earth-616)|Ptah]],{{r|{{cl|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #1}}; Khonshu's entry}} and was brother{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; Khonshu's entry}} or half-brother{{r|{{cl|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #1}}; Khonshu's entry}} to [[Bast (Earth-616)|Bast]] and [[Hathor-Sekhmet (Earth-616)|Sekhmet]].<ref group="note">Many of these sibling relationships are questionable in regards to Ra being his adoptive father instead of his father.</ref> According to [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], however, Khonshu is actually an ancient [[Elder God]] who predates the Earth and was merely incorporated into the mythologies of its mortal inhabitants after settling there at least one million years in the past.{{r|King in Black: Black Knight Vol 1 1}}

===Early Years===
Offended by not having been offered membership of the [[Avengers (1,000,000 BC) (Earth-616)|Stone Age Avengers]], Khonshu chose a mortal avatar - the first known [[Moon Knight (1,000,000 BC) (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]] - to enforce his will on Earth and antagonize the Avengers on his behalf, eventually leading to the establishment of the [[Cult of Khonshu (Earth-616)|Cult of Khonshu]] and a succession of Moon Knights.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 35}}

For some reason, perhaps due to the Ogdoad's aging and dying under unrevealed circumstances,{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; [[Heliopolitans]]' entry}} [[Mut (Earth-616)|Mut]] became Khonshu's stepmother.{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; Khonshu's entry}}

The worship of the Heliopolitans by the inhabitants of the [[Nile River Valley]] began around 10,000 BC,{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; [[Heliopolitans]]' entry}} although Khonshu was worshiped even before, since prehistoric times.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 35}} Since then, Khonshu and Ra have been warring against each other, having been reborn again and again through earthly avatars, with Khonshu beating Ra in every instance.{{r|Moon Knight Vol 1 190}}

===Modern Day===
Khonshu resurrected [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Marc Spector]] and blessed him with superhuman powers and abilities under the Moon.{{r|Moon Knight #1}}

When the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]] were stranded in ancient Egypt, Khonshu sought their help to dispose of [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Rama-Tut]].{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 21}} At the same time, [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] were also there, though all three groups were from different time periods. In the end, Rama-Tut escaped into the time-stream, while Khonshu contacted Marc in the modern day, who was able to bring the Avengers back to the future with the help of [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]] and the modern [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 22}}{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 23}} Afterwards, Khonshu desired to experience being an Avenger. So he made Marc believe it was his destiny to join the Avengers, before taking control of his physical body, unbeknownst to anyone. Months later, he was discovered by the [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Son of Satan]], who forced Khonshu out of Marc's body. Marc then decided to leave the Avengers.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 41}}

Khonshu helped Marc overcome many obstacles as '''Moon Knight''', but, over the years, Marc went completely insane and disappeared.{{r|Moon Knight Vol 6 12}} He later returned to continue his fight, despite his tenuous grip on reality,{{r|Moon Knight Vol 7 1}} but, after a while, Khonshu seemingly sent Marc and his allies to an illusory mental hospital{{r|Moon Knight Vol 8 1}} designed to wear away the last of Marc's mind, thus freeing his body for Khonshu to inhabit and use to enter our world.{{r|Moon Knight Vol 8 5}} However, in reality, it was all an imaginary scenario used to cure Marc of his insanity.<ref name="Bemis Tweet">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/maxbemis/status/936218223996837888|title=Max Bemis Tweet|work=Twitter|date=30 November 2017|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref> In it, Marc had a confrontation with his alternate personas and realized that, to become whole again, he couldn't just ignore them, but had to embrace them instead.{{r|Moon Knight Vol 8 9}} After returning to the Hospital, he crushed an illusory Khonshu's head and thus reconciled his illness, gaining control over his other personalities once and for all.{{r|Moon Knight Vol 8 14}}<Ref name="Bemis Tweet" />

Following the fight between [[Set (Earth-616)|Set]] and [[Worm (Country of the Worm) (Earth-616)|Wyrm]],{{r|Conan: Serpent War Vol 1 4}} Khonshu suffered horrifying prophetic nightmares about the end of the world at the hands of an army of the demon [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] and his pandimensional alternate selves. Moon Knight became affected by these visions and confronted Khonshu about them only to find out that the god was a victim of them as much as himself.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 34}} In order to stop this future from coming to pass, Khonshu had Moon Knight embark on a mission to steal the powers of the modern-day counterparts of the [[Avengers (1,000,000 BC) (Earth-616)|Avengers of the Stone Age]], seemingly motivated in part by Khonshu's jealousy that he hadn't been invited into the team's formation a million years ago.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 35}}

After stealing the powers of [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], the [[Roberto Reyes (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]], and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]],{{r|Avengers Vol 8 33}} Moon Knight killed Mephisto. He then gave the stolen powers to Khonshu, and the Moon God took over [[Manhattan]], rechristening it "New Thebes City" and using it as the starting point of a global conquest heralded by the Cult of Khonshu, with the Avengers becoming fugitives due to harboring one of Khonshu's targets, the infant [[Brandy Selby (Earth-616)|Starbrand]]. On his throne in New Thebes City, Khonshu was attacked by different alternate counterparts of Mephisto, though the Moon God managed to easily kill every one of his countless attackers.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 35}} By the time Khonshu tracked down the baby Starbrand, Moon Knight had become disillusioned by his master, and turned instead to a new power, the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 36}} Becoming the host of the Phoenix, Spector used its power to attack Khonshu, leaving him to be defeated and have the stolen powers stripped from him by the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 37}} Following his defeat, Khonshu was imprisoned in the dungeons of [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 38}}

| Powers                  = Khonshu has the conventional powers of the Ennead (the Heliopolitan gods), such as: 
* '''Superhuman Strength''': Khonshu can lift (press) 60 tons.{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; Khonshu's entry}}
* '''Superhuman Durability''': Khonshu possesses superhuman durability that allows him to withstand unspecified levels of injury. 
*'''Regenerative Healing Factor''': Despite his god-like durability, it is possible to injure Khonshu, but any damaged tissue heals much faster and better than even the healthiest human. 
*'''Immortality''': He is extremely long-lived and is immune to disease and aging. 
* '''Magic Manipulation''': Khonshu can manipulate mystic energies for supernatural effects such as interdimensional teleportation, telepathy, healing the injured, resurrection, earthquakes and to grant superhuman powers to mortal beings such as the [[Moon Knight]].{{r|Moon Knight Vol 2 1}}{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 21}}
* '''Lunakinesis:''' Khonshu was seemingly able to manipulate objects made out of moonrocks (including [[Uru]]).{{r|Avengers Vol 8 34}}
* '''Power Absorption:''' Khonshu was able to steal the powers of various heroes and store them inside some Ankhs.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 33}}
