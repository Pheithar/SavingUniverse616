===Early Life===
Víctor Álvarez was born and raised in [[Hell's Kitchen]], [[New York City]].{{r|Dark Reign: The List - Daredevil #1}} He is the son of  [[Reina Álvarez (Earth-616)|Reina Alvarez]] and former criminal [[Shades (Earth-616)|Shades]]. His father was sent to [[Seagate Prison]] when Victor was very young. Victor was raised by his mother alone. However after many years of crime his father returned to turn over a new leaf. He became a community organizer, fighting for decent housing for the locals. Victor worked with his father, but the relationship soured when Victor learned [[Shades (Earth-616)|Shades]] was cheating on his mother. After that Reina moved to his [[Ignacio Álvarez (Earth-616)|Uncle Ignacio]]'s place and took Victor with her. His father remained in contact with Victor as best as he could.{{r|Shadowland: Power Man #1}}

===The Explosion===
[[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] decided to remove the riff raff from the area so he could build a new [[Oscorp]] Building. He sent [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]] after [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], and also told him to blow up the building that Shade and the protesters were in. He rigged the building to explode but Daredevil tried to stop him, but because Daredevil refused to kill him, 107 of the residents were killed. Shades and his son were both in the building. However Victor was the sole survivor, having absorbed fragments from his fathers [[Shades' Visor|visor]]. Victor became the new Power Man as he absorbed the [[Chi]] life force of the 107 killed, including his father. He could also see the chi ghosts of the 107 victims on the site of the wrecked building, including his father. Shades told him to open up and absorb more chi from the area, giving his son enough power to fight back.{{r|Shadowland: Power Man #1}}

===Shadowland===
[[File:Víctor Álvarez (Earth-616) from Mighty Avengers Vol 2 5.INH.png|thumb|left|New York Tiger-Style Kung Fu]]
Daredevil extended the Hand's power over Hell's Kitchen, creating a blanket of fear. Victor chose the identity of Power Man to protect his neighbors. This drew the attention of [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]], the previous Power Man, and [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], who was intrigued that he could use one of his signature moves without ever seeing him. Victor has expressed disdain for both men, in particular Luke Cage, who he accuses of "selling out". Luke Cage left him, but Iron Fist decided to stay and learn more of his past and his potential powers. Together they found out of how he survived the collapsing of the building and how he knew of the power only Iron Fist and his students knew. Before he died, the chi of all the residents flowed into him, one of those residents being one of Danny's students. [[Tilda Johnson (Earth-616)|Nightshade]] revealed she created the visor. It could generate optic blasts by pulling in bioelectric energy from the environment. According to her the absorbing crystal became embedded in Victor's skin.{{r|Shadowland: Power Man #2}} Together they battled the [[Flashmob (Earth-616)|Flashmob]] and [[Cornell Stokes (Earth-616)|Cottonmouth]].{{r|Shadowland: Power Man #3}}

[[File:Shadowland Power Man Vol 1 2 Textless.jpg|right|thumb]]
The [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] kidnapped his cousin [[Sofía Álvarez (Earth-616)|Sofia]], and he traveled to the [[Shadowland Fortress]] to save her. However on the way there Victor confronted by the Chi ghost of his father and his neighbors. It was revealed that Shadowland was built on the site of the old building. He learned that the spirits were now within him, giving him his abilities. Victor absorbed [[Javier de Paz (Earth-616)|Javier de Paz]] martial art skills, a student of Iron Fist. Victor vowed to fight for their memories. In the chamber, Victor confronted his cousin Sofia. She exclaimed that it is obviously a trap, just before the Retainer attacked him. Victor was knocked senseless, almost passing out. In a haze, he saw his father's ghost, making an "exploding" motion with his hands. Victor saw what he meant, and drew on the power of the city, the neighborhood, and the people, places and memories of them, and used it, turning his body into a thing of iron. Iron Fist made his way to Victor, having fought Daredevil. Iron Fist rescued Sofia and found Victor recuperating. Iron Fist offered to be his teacher, and Victor agreed, on the condition that Iron Fist take care of his mother. 
[[File:Shadowland Power Man Vol 1 1 page 00 Víctor Álvarez (Earth-616).jpg|left|thumb]]
One week later, Mrs. Alvarez was shown around the [[Rand Corporation (Earth-616)|Rand Foundation]] by [[Joy Meachum (Earth-616)|Joy Meachum]]. It turned out that Victor was given a job with them, and they will be helping her from now on. Mrs. Alvarez approved of this, because she wanted Victor to stay out of fights. It was from there that Victor began his training.{{r|Shadowland: Power Man #4}}

===Spider-Man===
[[File:Víctor Álvarez (Earth-616) from Power Man and Iron Fist Vol 2 1 0001.png|right|thumb]]
When training with Iron Fist, he revealed that the only superhero he never managed to defeat was [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], because of his spider-sense. He decided that the only way to prove himself was to take down Spidey. He found him at an event where [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|Mayor Jameson]] reluctantly presented Spider-Man the key to the city, a request made by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. He however disrupted the event and attacked the hero. Victor landed a punch and started gloating about how he's better than Iron Fist now. However Spidey just webbed him to a tree, and asked him why he attacked him. When he learned that Victor was present due to a tip he got about the key, they realized it had been stolen during the fight. Alvarez told Spidey that the one who gave him the tip is named [[Norton Fester (Earth-616)|Norton G. Fester]], who Spider-Man knew as the Looter.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #652}} The criminals attacked the Federal Hall on Wall Street, but the heroes teamed up to stop them. The criminals were there to find a hidden secret locked in the building. Fester used a old key from the 1700's to open a floor chamber and used his dazzle gun on the heroes to temporarily disorient them. Fester found the fallen star that was discovered by Free Mason [[Benjamin Franklin (Earth-616)|Benjamin Franklin]] which was used for their rituals for centuries. Fester planned to use the vapors from the fallen meteor to increase his power when it started to crack. The meteor was actually an egg and an alien octopus creature emerged. Power Man killed the alien creature with the American flag while Fester and his men were taken into custody.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #653}}

===Training with Iron Fist===
Iron Fist took Victor under his wing and together he helped him on many adventures including fighting the organization [[Commedia Dell'Morte (Earth-616)|Commedia Dell'Morte]],{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist Vol 2 #1|2}} [[Pokerface (Earth-616)|Pokerface]],{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist Vol 2 #3}} and the [[Penance Corps (Earth-616)|Penance Corps]].{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist Vol 2 #4|5}}

===Fear Itself===
Power Man ended up in the middle of the [[Pacific Ocean]] with [[Anya Corazon (Earth-616)|Spider-Girl]], [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]], [[Kevin Masterson (Earth-616)|Thunderstrike]], and [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus Cho]].{{r|Fear Itself: The Home Front #5}} The heroes battled a group of Samurai Shark-Men.{{r|Fear Itself: The Home Front #6}} After the battle it was revealed that Cho brought together the young heroes in the hopes that they would join his new super team. The young heroes were not happy because he has manipulated them, and they turned his offer down.{{r|Fear Itself: The Home Front #7}}

===Avengers Academy===
[[File:Víctor Álvarez (Earth-616) from Avengers Academy Vol 1 33.jpg|thumb|right|Power Man in the Avengers Academy]]
Victor is recruited to join the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]].{{r|Avengers Academy #21}} He joined the young trainee heroes on many adventures.{{r|Avengers Academy #23}}{{r|Avengers Academy #26}} The team went up against the [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]].{{r|Avengers Academy #32}} Though they ultimately won, many of the students including Victor decided to leave the school.{{r|Avengers Academy #33}}

===Mighty Avengers===
Victor joined Danny in joining the [[Heroes for Hire (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]], along with Luke Cage and [[Ava Ayala (Earth-616)|White Tiger]]. They all started believing they were meant for something more and decided to create their own Avengers team.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 #1}} Based off a hashtag, they named themselves the [[Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]].

[[File:Víctor Álvarez (Earth-616) from Young Avengers Vol 2 12.jpg|thumb|left|Power Man in the Young Avengers]]
He and White Tiger worked with the [[Young Avengers]] to battle [[Mother (Interdimensional Parasite) (Earth-TRN287)|Mother the Interdimensional Parasite]].{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #11|12}} He later celebrated at the superhero club known as Thin Spandex Club.{{r|Young Avengers Vol 2 #13|14}}

Since joining, Victor and Ava have bonded tremendously, together they discovered two new abilities to fuse her White Tiger God based powers and his chi manipulation. The first being him able to move chi from people within their area into Ava creating a [[White Tiger]] made out of chi.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 #4.INH}} The tiger was so powerful that it was able to destroy [[Shuma-Gorath (Multiverse)|Shuma-Gorath]].{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 3}}

[[File:Víctor Álvarez (Earth-616) from Mighty Avengers Vol 2 5 002.jpg|thumb|right|Power Man in the Mighty Avengers]] 
Feeling grateful that Victor enabled her to control that kind of power, she later repaid him by transferring some of her power to him. Being that Ava has a lot more chi than the average person, it gave Victor tremendous amounts of power, enough to take out a Cerberus or demonic three headed dog. Him and Ava called their combo the "New York Tiger-Style Kung Fu."{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 5.INH}}

He helped White Tiger when she tried to kill [[Gideon Mace (Earth-616)|Gideon Mace]] for the death of her parents, and was being possessed by the Tiger god that gave her powers.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 #6}} With the intervention of the [[Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]] White Tiger was prevented from crossing the line and killing Mace.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 #7}}

===New Avengers===
Once the Mighty Avengers were shut down,{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 8}} Power Man and White Tiger followed each other to joining the ranks of the rebranded [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], forming part of its [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|New Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 1}}

After fighting alongside the New Avengers for many adventures, Víctor felt he had relegated his home neighborhood for too long, and decided to return to New York and protect Spanish Harlem again. He was joined by [[Max Brashear (Earth-616)|Max Brashear]], a partially-reformed supervillain and A.I.M. scientist who had befriended Víctor.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 18}}

| Powers                  = '''[[Chi Manipulation]]:''' As a result of absorbing fragments of his [[Shades' Visor|father's visor]], Victor can draw into himself chi and cultural energy from his environment, enhancing his body.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 14}} He can demonstrate superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, generation of personal force fields and accelerated healing; Victor glows when empowered in the same way when Iron Fist powers up his chi fist punch. He can explode chi outward through punches, and can channel messages through bioelectric frequencies. He sometimes experiences memories of those who died in the tenement's explosion.{{r|Avengers: Roll Call #1}} [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America (Sam Wilson)]] and [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] considered him to be a Gamma Level Threat.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 1}} The level of Victor's enhancements is proportional to the amount of cultural energy he can draw from the environment, meaning the older the location, the longer history it has, therefore it possesses more energy for Victor to absorb.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 14}}<!-- Coundn't find an older reference for Victor's abilities being tied to cultural energy, since before this edit, his page only mentioned chi. --> Victor's powers also work better the more he knows about his surroundings, especially if he has a personal connection to them.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 6}} Because of this, he wears a pair of goggles that directly feed into his brain information about his surroundings.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 5}}
* '''Power Augmentation:''' Victor can use chi to enhance the vitality or superpowers of others while in direct contact with them. He recently displayed enhanced abilities of chi in conjunction with [[Ava Ayala (Earth-616)|White Tiger]]: he was able to track her by her chi signature, and transfer the chi from the entirety of New York City into the spirit of the White Tiger to defeat [[Shuma-Gorath (Multiverse)|Shuma-Gorath]].{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 3}}
* '''Energy Absorption:''' Reacting on instinct when first matched against Iron Fist, Vic managed to absorb and nullify his signature strike leeching off his chi energy into himself. He's since learned to control this aspect of his abilities more openly with training and practice.
* '''Skill Mimicry:''' Danny says that when Vic's building exploded, he absorbed the lifeforce (chi) of all the deceased people in self-defense, including one of Iron Fist's Thunder Dojo students, [[Javier de Paz (Earth-616)|Javier de Paz]]. Javier was the only student who mastered the "Screaming Eagle Slap" but was killed in Bullseye's blast. Danny surmises that this is how Victor knows the K'un L'un technique without ever having practiced it himself. Victor absorbed the life-force (chi) of 107 people. The only added skill that we know of is his innate martial arts abilities gained from Javier. In a city like New York it would be normal that Victor would also have other innate skills. This has yet to be seen but different languages, political and legal knowledge, medical/nursing skills, Detective/deductive skill or computer/hacking skills would all be more likely than mastering the "Screaming Eagle Slap.{{r|Avengers: Roll Call #1}}
*'''Memory Condition''': Victor's powers stem from reading and assimilating chi from the surrounding area gleaning all manor of information and ancient knowledge he can glean from anything or anyone he is drawing the esoteric information from. Victor turns that information into raw power learning everything he can through this and gaining new, greater levels of power from it.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 6}}
* '''Size Manipulation:''' With a proper influx of Chi, Victor can temporarily augment his bodily mass and tissue density making his attacks stronger, enabling him to hit infinitely harder than normal.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 5.INH}}

| Abilities               = '''Skilled Martial Artist:''' Through absorbing De Paz's memories and from direct training from Iron Fist, Victor is a skilled martial artist.{{r|Avengers: Roll Call #1}}
| Strength                = Class 25
| Weaknesses              = Bioelectric jamming devices can temporarily inhibit Victor's power.{{r|Avengers: Roll Call #1}}

Areas that are daily scrubbed clean and or constantly remodeled on a regular basis leaves Power Man powerless as he needs fresh memories to draw power and information from.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 13}}

| Equipment               = Víctor Álvarez wears a yellow and black body suit with metal embellishments, similar to the look of Luke Cage, the first Power Man.{{r|Avengers: Roll Call #1}} As a member of [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|Avengers Ideas Mechanics]], Víctor Álvarez had a set of goggles designed for him that download information from the Internet directly into his brain by a GPS link, giving him one hundred years of local knowledge per second to vastly enhance his powers.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 5}}
