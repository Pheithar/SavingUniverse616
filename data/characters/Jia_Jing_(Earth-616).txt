===Origin===
When [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] became the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Dark Phoenix]] and began destroying the [[Earth]], '''Jia Jing''' was on a bus ride in [[Beijing]], [[China]].

As that bus drove off a bridge, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] prevented it from falling by restraining it using his web, and swooped in to rescue the occupants.

At the same time, the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] was dispersed by [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]] and the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]; Jia's powers manifested while under Spider-Man's protection.{{r|Avengers vs. X-Men Vol 1 12}}
