===Early Life===
Dennis Dunphy was born and raised in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan (State)|Michigan]]. As a young man, he idolized superheroes. A successful college football player, he hoped to be recruited as a professional, but despite trying out for a number of teams, he was chosen by none.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 3 2}} When he was approached by an agent of the [[Curtiss Jackson (Earth-616)|Power Broker]] and offered the chance to undergo a process to increase his physical strength to superhuman levels, hoping this would increase his chances of being a professional football player. He agreed, and had his strength boosted, but with his new-found power, he could not safely compete against regular athletes.{{r|Thing #28}}

===Demolition Man===
The Power Broker offered him a place in the new [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]] (UCWF), where he could use his augmented strength against other similarly augmented wrestlers. He fought with the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing (Ben Grimm)]], among others, and called himself "Demolition Dunphy."{{r|Thing #28|29}}

Unbeknownst to Dunphy, Power Brokers Inc. was a criminal organization. They supplied pills to their clients, purportedly to stabilize their metabolisms after the treatments, but in reality to keep them addicted to the pills and under their control.{{r|Thing #33|34}} Grimm and [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel (Sharon Ventura)]] (a fellow client of Power Brokers and UCWF wrestler) discovered that approximately half of Power Brokers' clients had come out of their treatments with brain damage or deformities. Power Brokers commanded some of their clients, including Dunphy, to capture Grimm and Ventura, and threatened to withhold their pills if they refused. Dunphy followed his conscience, however, and refused to betray his friends. Although he went through a harrowing two weeks of withdrawal, he freed himself from Power Brokers' control.{{r|Thing #35|36}}

===Captain America===
[[File:Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616) from Captain America Vol 1 346 001.jpg|left|thumb]]
[[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] took an interest in Power Broker Inc. because of one of its clients, the [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|Super-Patriot]]. Dunphy allied himself with Rogers, created a costume based on those of Daredevil and Wolverine, and captured [[Karlin Malus (Earth-616)|Karl Malus]], the head scientist. Soon afterward, Power Broker's agents captured Dunphy and put him through more treatments, which resulted in a heart attack.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 330}} He was rescued by Captain America. While he was recovering from his heart attack, Dunphy operated Rogers's telephone hotline.

After [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|John Walker]] supplanted Rogers as Captain America, Rogers became a costumed adventurer known as The Captain, receiving from Dunphy a black costume inspired by his original uniform. Dunphy, [[Jack Monroe (Earth-616)|Nomad (Jack Monroe)]], the [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]], and [[Priscilla Lyons (Earth-616)|Vagabond]] joined Rogers on several missions, going up against the [[Serpent Society (Earth-616)|Serpent Society]], the Horseman of the Apocalypse [[Autumn Rolfson (Earth-616)|Famine]], and a group of superhuman criminals who had broken out of the prison for super villains known as the [[Vault]]. In the latter conflict, Demolition-Man tried to apprehend the villainess [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]]. However, Titania's strength far exceeded his, and she threw him off a cliff, nearly killing him. After the encounter with Titania, Dunphy lost confidence in himself.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 340}} 

Throughout their partnership with the Captain, Dunphy found himself in an adversarial relationship with Nomad. While Rogers and Wilson were welcoming to Dunphy as an ally, Monroe saw him as a naive goody-two-shoes, and grew increasingly paranoid that Dunphy would put the moves on Vagabond. When Vagabond asked Dunphy to train her in unarmed combat, Monroe attempted to fight Dunphy, only for Vagabond to throw Monroe into a pool. Further fighting was interrupted by the arrival of envoys of the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]], who had arrived to deliver a new [[Vibranium]] shield to Rogers.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 342}}

During the [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]]'s insurrection in [[Washington, D.C.]], after she had taken control of the Serpent Society, the Captain had managed to subdue her, but after [[Klaus Voorhees (Earth-616)|Cobra]]'s bungled attempt to kill her (interfered with by Nomad) ended up disabling her restraints instead, she took advantage of the situation and bit Dunphy on the neck, poisoning him. [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]], who, having remained loyal to the Society's founder [[Seth Voelker (Earth-616)|Sidewinder]], had been helping Cap and his allies fight the Viper, gave Dunphy an anti-toxin. However, the two soon encountered Walker and his partner, [[Lemar Hoskins (Earth-616)|Battlestar]], who took them for aiding the insurrection. Dunphy fought Battlestar, but in his weakened condition was no match for him, and he was taken into custody by the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities (Earth-616)|Commission on Superhuman Activities]] for interrogation, along with Diamondback (who was captured by Walker) and Nomad (who was found unconscious, having been beaten by a poisoned mob).{{r|Captain America Vol 1 344}} In exchange for their group's help in saving him, Sidewinder offered Dunphy a chance to escape custody along with Diamondback and Nomad, but Dunphy chose to stay behind, believing it is what Rogers would do, much to Nomad's chagrin.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 345}}

===The Avengers===
[[File:Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616) from Captain America Vol 1 329 001.jpg|thumb|right|Demolition-Man]]
Upon his release, Dunphy found Rogers trying to reconstitute his team the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], and Dunphy joined the team on an informal basis. To help Battlestar, Dunphy and Rogers flew to the Arctic to rescue Battlestar's partner, the current [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|Captain America]] (and former Super-Patriot), from [[Underground Liberated Totally Integrated Mobile Army To Unite Mankind (Earth-616)|U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M.]]. Dunphy, still unsure of himself, waited in an Avengers [[Quinjet]] while Rogers and Battlestar investigated. When Rogers learned that U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. was about to trigger an electromagnetic pulse, he asked Dunphy to crash the Quinjet into the base. Before Dunphy could eject, two U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. agents tried to plant bombs on the aircraft. One bomb went off. The Quinjet crashed into the base and stopped the pulse, but Dunphy sank into the ocean with the Quinjet wreckage and was presumed dead.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 349}}

Dunphy miraculously survived the crash and lived with an Inuit tribe, but he lost his voice and much of his vitality. The [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] and [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|US Agent]] rescued him after he was kidnapped by ULTIMATUM. Rogers, with the help of other Avengers, nursed Dunphy back to health.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 405}} Dunphy then discovered Zerotown, underground home of the Zero People, and became their protector.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 418}}

===Serf===
During the Morgan Conquest, when [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fey]] reshaped reality to her liking, every living Avenger became an unwilling member of the Queen's Vengeance, her bodyguards. Dunphy took the name Serf.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 1|4}}

[[File:Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616) fron New Avengers Annual Vol 2 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]
Possibly as a delayed after-effect of the Power Broker treatments, Dunphy became schizophrenic. He believed that a voice was instructing him to collect the [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Gems]]. Instead he stole ordinary gems. Daredevil convinced Dunphy to get treatment for his illness.{{r|The Pulse #11|13}}

===Civil War===
Dunphy sided against the [[Superhuman Registration Act]] during the [[Civil War]], alongside [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Civil War: War Crimes #1}} After the [[Civil War]], he was listed as a potential recruit for the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]].{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report #1}}

...{{r|Hulk vs Hercules #1}}

===Dark Reign ===
During [[Dark Reign]], he enlisted in the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Army]] serving in [[Iraq]] He covertly operated as D-Man when he could, enlisting the help of his fellow soldiers.{{r|Marvel Assistant-Sized Spectacular #1}}

===Pie of the Tiger===
At a picnic held by the Avengers he competed in a pie eating contest and beat the Thing, [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Noh-Varr]], and the [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]].{{r|I Am an Avenger #2}}

===Danielle Cage===
He was one of the many applicants for nanny to [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] and [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]]' daughter, [[Danielle Cage (Earth-616)|Danielle Cage]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 7}}

===Revengers===
Prior to [[Fear Itself|War of the Serpent]], D-Man joined [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]]'s [[Revengers (Earth-616)|Revengers]], a group dedicated to dismantling the Avengers, and successfully attacked the [[Avengers Mansion]].{{r|New Avengers Annual Vol 2 1}} He was defeated by the combined forces of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], and when he was interrogated, he posed as a pawn of the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]], wanting to get back the [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Gems]] for him, but that the Avengers never answered to him. It is unclear whether D-Man was aware that the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] actually possessed the Gems at this time.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 3 1}}

[[File:Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616) as Scourge from Captain America Vol 6 11.JPG|right|thumb|Scourge]]
===Scourge===
Somehow, Dunphy escaped or was freed from prison, and was used by [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Gyrich]] and [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] to mind-control him to turn him into the new [[Scourge]].{{r|Captain America Vol 6 11|12}} Sharon Carter was forced to fatally shoot Dunphy during his encounter with Captain America.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 13|14}}

===Resurrection===
Dunphy was revived by a boy wishing to summon a demon (and instead had D-Man resurrected). After visiting the [[Avengers Mansion]], meeting with [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Jarvis]] and [[Elvin Haliday (Earth-616)|Rage]], he had the best day of his life, just before being killed by the [[Glossary:Incursion|incursion]] between [[Earth-616]] and [[Earth-1610]].{{r|Secret Wars Too #1}} When the universe was brought back, Dennis started working for the new [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America]] as a pilot, mechanic, technician, and field backup, and bought himself a battle armor to "finally look cool."{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson #1}}

[[File:Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616) from Venomized Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|left|D-Man bonded to a symbiote before being assimilated]]
When the [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)|Hive]]'s invaded Earth, they sent agents to force [[Symbiotes (Race)|Symbiotes]] into bonding with superhumans, so then a [[Poison]] could assimilate both the Symbiote and its host. Together with Rage, D-Man oversaw the evacuation of [[Manhattan]] through the [[Manhattan Bridge]]. They were both attacked by a group of Poisons and bonded to symbiotes. Shortly afterwards, they were consumed by a Poison, resulting in their deaths.{{r|Venomized Vol 1 2}}

Despite his apparent death, Dennis returned, having broken up with his boyfriend, [[Chris (Dennis Dunphy's Boyfriend) (Earth-616)|Chris]], and apparently having lost his powers. He assisted [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]] in saving Lockjaw's siblings from [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]]. He ultimately adopted one of [[Lockjaw's Brother (Earth-616)|Lockjaw's brothers]] as his own pet.{{r|Lockjaw Vol 1 1}}{{r|Lockjaw Vol 1 4}}

===Ravencroft===
Dennis was then hired as security guard at [[Ravencroft Institute]]. After convincing the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]], who had been imprisoned in Ravencroft, to calm down and drop his weapon, Dennis helped [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]] to defend himself from [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mr. Hyde]], but was accidentally stabbed by Hyde in the chest.{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 3}} When the [[Unwanted (Earth-616)|Unwanted]] took over the asylum, the injured Dennis and the rest of the staff were locked in a cell. One of the Unwanted thought to make a blood transfusion with their vampiric blood, but [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] refused to let them even touch him.{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 4}} The leader of the Unwanted, [[William Adams (Earth-616)|Bud Adams]], tried to make John Jameson tell him where he hid the [[Journal of Jonas Ravencroft|Journal of Jonas Ravencroft]] and offered to heal Dunphy by making him a vampire in exchange for Jameson's cooperation. When the asylum was retaken, Dunphy was healed by Adams.{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 5}}
