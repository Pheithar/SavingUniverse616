===Origin===
Born to a family of five siblings, young Japheth never quite grew at the normal rate of his other siblings. He suffered from terrible stomach pains and required a special food. Told by doctors his terrible stomach pains were caused by cancer, and not wanting to drain his family's finances with medical treatment, young Japheth left his small [[South Africa|South African]] village at twelve to commit suicide. He wound up in the Kalahari Desert only to be found and saved by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], who helped uncover the nature of the boy's malady: two slug-like creatures that dwelt within his guts that were the boy's digestive system,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 76}} which he later named Eany and Meany.{{r|Children of the Atom Vol 1 1}}

Magneto extracted the slugs and brought Japheth back home, but found Japheth's father had been killed by rebel fighters, the Afrikaners. Asked to help, Magneto slaughtered the rebels in retaliation with Japheth by his side, but the boy was horrified and said he would never join Magneto's cause. Magneto grew angry, but told Japheth he would one day change his mind.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 76}}

Little is known of what Maggott did in the following years, but at some point he decided to search out Magneto, to attempt to have Magneto help him master his powers. Maggott's slugs, Eany and Meany, had to burrow their way in and out of his stomach each time, causing immense pain. They also feasted up to five times daily, and the physical and mental toll was becoming too much for the young man.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 76}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 345}}

Using his psychometric powers - which allowed him to read "memories" of a specific area - Maggott finally believed he traced Magneto's signature down to [[New York City]] -- but found [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]] instead. After a brief showdown, they were all suddenly teleported away to [[Antarctica]] and put on the jury at the Trial of Gambit with other various [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. At this location, Maggott finally met with [[Joseph (Earth-616)|Joseph]] who, at the time, was believed to be the real Magneto. He finally was able to express his gratitude to the man for saving his life as a child.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 348|350}}

===X-Men===
Maggott followed the team back to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|mansion]] where they found [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] undergoing surgery to remove a bomb within his chest. When the bomb was removed, however, it was still going to detonate, and the team panicked. One of Maggott's slugs gulped down the device, where it detonated in its belly - but caused no more reaction than a fiery burp. Maggott was asked to join the X-Men on a full-time basis.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 70}}

He would often keep to himself, due to his bizarre eating habits, which made the rest of the team suspicious. While flirting with all the girls at Xavier's - [[Cecilia Reyes (Earth-616)|Cecilia Reyes]] in particular - Maggott feared the others would be repulsed by the true nature of his power.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 352|353}}

Shortly after his arrival, several humans were murdered (nearly devoured, in fact) in [[Salem Center]]. The suspect appeared to be Eany and Meany on a rampage - but, after a botched attempt on [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s life, the culprit was revealed to be a group of Ru'Tai demons lead by a creature called [[Pilgrimm (Earth-616)|Pilgrimm]]. They bore an uncanny resemblance to the slugs. The team luckily defeated the demons and Maggott was prompted to finally reveal his history to Wolverine. The two began to bond, with Wolverine keeping his secrets (including his true age), but this bonding time was cut short by a threat from the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] in [[Africa]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 75|78}}

After returning to the mansion, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] believed it would be best for Maggott to further explore his mutant abilities at the [[Massachusetts Academy]] with [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 79}} He agreed and transferred to the school, but his schooling was again cut short by another threat. This time it came in the form of a big game hunter in search of Maggott's slugs. The Generation X team helped defend Maggott and the slugs from the hunter, but the man escaped. Feeling distraught after having brought danger to his new teammates, Maggott decided to pursue the hunter, and was not heard from again for some time.{{r|Generation X Vol 1 48|49}}

Maggott briefly returned to Xavier's school for the funeral of Joseph.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 368}}

===Death===
At some point during his further travels, Maggott was captured by [[Weapon X (Team) (Earth-616)|Weapon X]]. Sadly, he was one of the first to be executed at [[Neverland]], the mutant internment camp. Before he was killed, he gave one of his slugs to [[Wendy Taylor (Earth-616)|two]] [[Billy Taylor (Earth-616)|children]] in the camp, so a piece of him would survive.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 5}} Unfortunately, the children and the slug were "escaped" by [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|"Doctor Windsor"]] (truly Mister Sinister, master of cloning), and the slug is now being held by the mutant scientist.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 13}}

===Life?===
Maggott was later revived using magic and the [[Techno-Organic Virus|techno-organic virus]] to aid in [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]]'s assault on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy Vol 1 231}}

Additionally, [[Age of X|reality had shifted]] significantly around the X-Men.{{Citation}}

He appeared to attend [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops']] speech at [[Washington, D.C.]] about the peaceful Mutant Revolution.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 600}}

Japheth was further confirmed to be alive when he and one of his slugs attended the first meeting of the [[Mindfulness of Mutant Appearances (Earth-616)|Mindfulness of Mutant Appearances]], a support group set up by [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] for mutants unable to pass as normal humans.{{r|Domino Annual Vol 1 1}}

Japheth (or a cosplaying look-alike) appeared waiting in line for the X-Men-themed 17th birthday party of [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]] at the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] in New York City. The party bouncers postulated that this was the real Japheth, stating offhand "...who would dress up like Maggott?" (a dig at Maggott's lack of popularity as a X-Man).{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 2 9}}

===X-Men Disassembled===
Japheth was made to vanish along with the X-Men by [[Nathaniel Grey (Earth-295)|Nate Grey]] after they confronted him for trying to impose his vision on the world.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 9|10}}

===Age of X-Man===
Japheth and the others were sent to Nate Grey's new [[Age of X-Man (Plane)|reality]] where Nate attempted to create a utopia where mutants live in peace. Everyone transported there had their memories of their previous lives erased.{{r|Age of X-Man Alpha Vol 1 1}}

Brother Japheth became a member of a group of [[Homo superior|mutants]] who followed [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|En Sabah Nur]] who, along with [[Victor Borkowski (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Anole]], [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Transonic]], [[Ben Hammil (Earth-616)|Match]], and [[Scripture (Age of X-Man) (Earth-616)|Scripture]] were engaged in plan to set off an explosion at the [[Hope Summers Memorial Library]] in order to end the fake memories that had plagued them.{{r|Age of X-Man: Nextgen Vol 1 2}}

While not seen, he was later allowed by Nate Grey to return to the real world after Nate realized the flaws of his reality.{{r|Age of X-Man Omega Vol 1 1}}

===House of X===
Japheth was present at the opening of the new homeland of all mutants by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|X]] and co. inviting all amongst Homo Superior to partake of the housing and revelry amongst its splendor.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}} He was also after Xavier had been attacked by invading homunculi and was a part of a contingent with Storm in first approaching the [[Children of the Atom (Earth-616)|Children of the Atom]].{{r|X-Force Vol 6 9}}{{r|Children of the Atom Vol 1 1}}

'''Sentient Digestive System''': Maggott's digestive system consisted of two enormous sentient techno-organic slug-like creatures, nicknamed Eany and Meany. Whilst Maggott himself could not eat, his slugs could devour any form of matter with incredible speed. When they finished feeding, they returned to his abdomen and imparted the energy from the matter they absorbed into Maggott's body. This energy nourished Maggott, temporarily granting him enhanced strength and durability, as well as turning his skin blue.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 73}}

Maggott's slugs could act autonomously from him and appeared to be highly intelligent. They communicated with him via a telepathic rapport, and were extremely sensitive to magic.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #75}}

*'''''Enhanced Strength'''''

*'''''Enhanced Durability'''''

*'''''Psychometric Recall''''': Maggott once demonstrated psychometry, allowing him to read the past events that transpired in his immediate area.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 349}}

* [[Joe Kelly|Joe Kelly]] used an Afrikaans lexicon that was at one-time available on the web to pepper Maggott's speech with authentic slang.{{Citation}}

* The connection between the slugs and the Ru'Tai is never fully explored. Pilgrimm appears to have been intended to be a new major villain.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 75}}
