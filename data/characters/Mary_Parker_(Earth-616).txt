| History                 = Mary Parker was the wife of [[Richard Parker (Earth-616)|Richard Parker]], and like him, was a [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|CIA]] agent. The two of them had a son, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter]], and a daughter, [[Teresa Parker (Earth-616)|Teresa]],{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 302}} though the latter was born in secret.

At an unknown point, Richard and Mary found the parts of [[Master Matrix (Earth-616)|Master Matrix]], an advanced [[Life-Model Decoy]] capable of controlling other LMDs, in a [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] weapons depot on an uncharted island. They rebuilt him, but Mary believed that Matrix was alive and that [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] should set him free.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 33}}

While Peter was still an infant and Teresa was a newborn, Richard and Mary were assigned to infiltrate the Algerian-based spy ring controlled by Communist agent the [[Albert Malik (Earth-616)|Red Skull]], but the Skull discovered they were double agents and had them killed by his agent [[Karl Fiers (Earth-616)|the Finisher]] in an airplane crash overseas and framed for treason.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #5}}

While Richard and Mary were on assignment, Richard's brother [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|Ben]] and Ben's wife [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|May]] took care of Peter. Ben and May had never had children of their own, but after Richard and Mary died, they became Peter’s surrogate parents and raised him as if he were their own son.
