| History                 = This Supreme Hydra led [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] in an attack against [[Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)|The Leader's]] survivalist bunker [[Freehold]], in [[Canada]], even if the Supreme Hydra's secret master insisted in Hydra not moving against the Leader. Hydra's assault was opposed by the Leader's security, mostly [[Riot Squad (Earth-616)|Riot Squad]], and by the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], who reached the place independently to oppose the Leader. The Hulk ravaged Hydra's army and consciously pardoned the Supreme Hydra's life - but the Supreme Hydra was then shot down by [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|the second Redeemer]], one of the Leader's minions.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 400}}
