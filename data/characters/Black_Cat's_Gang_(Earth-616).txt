| HistoryText             = ===The Motivation===
While controlling the body of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]] brutally defeated [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]].{{r|Superior Spider-Man #20}} When the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|Police]] arrested her, she lost her secret identify, her stolen possessions, and her allies. Imprisoned in Conway Penitentiary, she realized than in order to regain all that she had lost, she must have revenge on Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 1}}

===Beginnings===
After escaping from prison, Black Cat began stalking the arachnid hero, whose body was back in the control of Peter Parker.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 1}} During one of her stalkings, she noticed that [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]] was hunting [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]] down to depower him. Knowing that he too was humiliated by Spider-Man (again while Octavius was in control),{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 5}} she recruited Max onto her side.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 3}} She used him as an enforcer to establish some dominance over the underworld. In the process, she defeated [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] mob boss [[Edward Lavell (Earth-616)|Eel]], and secured an alliance with the [[Goblin Nation (Earth-616)|Goblin Nation]] and the [[Inner Demons (Earth-616)|Inner Demons]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 5}} She later tried to recruit other villains, but they declined because of her affiliation to Electro. Black Cat then thwarted Parker Industries's plan to create a prison for super villains by trying to kill Electro, but was stopped by Spider-Man and [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Silk]]. After said event, the criminals joined Black Cat's criminal army since she cut ties with Dillon.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 6}}

Now established as a major player in the underworld, Felicia bought the [[Bar with No Name]]{{r|Star-Lord Vol 2 3}} and, later, allied herself with [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]] to take down the new [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Spider-Man]],{{r|Spider-Man Vol 2 #3|5}} which marked the beginning of a formal partnership, as Hammerhead eventually became Black Cat's muscle and second in command.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 2 16}} Hardy additionally hired [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Scorpion]] on her side as a part-time enforcer.{{r|Venom Vol 3 1}} For a short while, Black Cat even hired a man named [[Lee Price (Earth-616)|Lee Price]] after he survived a shootout at a black market sale that also involved [[Tombstone's Gang (Earth-616)|Tombstone's Gang]], without knowing that Price was secretly the new [[Venom]].{{r|Venom Vol 3 2}}

===Downfall===
After losing the Venom symbiote to its former owner [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]], Lee Price stole the [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Mania Symbiote]] from [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Andi Benton]] and used it to establish a criminal gang. He forced pieces of the symbiote into the faces of small-time criminals to control their minds, and formed his [[Inklings (Earth-616)|Inklings]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc. Alpha Vol 1 1}} After obtaining a measurable amount of manpower, Lee attacked Black Cat's operations and used the Mania symbiote to take control of her subordinates and Felicia herself.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 792}} Since Black Cat's gang had been invited for the very first time to the gathering of the five largest crime families in the world, Lee seized Black Cat's operations so to make his way into the gathering and take control of the other families.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 793}}

Felicia managed to free herself from Maniac's influence{{r|Venom Vol 1 159}} and joined forces with Spider-Man, Venom, [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom]] and Benton to stop him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 793}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 160}} Unfortunately for her, once the dust settled following Price's defeat, Felicia had lost her gang and her clout.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc. Omega Vol 1 1}}
