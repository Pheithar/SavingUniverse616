| Overview                = After being bombarded with extra-dimensional energy emmited by a stolen device, harbor patrol officer Monica Rambeau acquired the ability to convert her body mass into any form of energy of the electromagnetic spectrum, granting her the alias of '''Captain Marvel.'''{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 16}} Unable to achieve success in the navy as she faced adversities as a black woman, Rambeau met recognition with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 227}} Her competence led her to become one of the most trustworthy members of the group and, in due course, their chairwoman.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 279}}

However, Rambeau succumbed to a tragic fate when the Avengers were betrayed by [[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Doctor Druid]]. As a consequence, she was gravely wounded in combat and lost her powers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 294}} After a slow recovery,{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 2 1}} she was welcomed back to the Avengers, sporadically assisting the team in times of need.{{r|Operation Galactic Storm}} In another dramatic turn of events, Rambeau was manipulated by the [[Beyond Corporation (Multiverse)|Beyond Corporation]] into commanding their super-hero team, [[Nextwave (Earth-63163)|Nextwave]]. Upon learning their vile intentions, Rambeau and her team went rogue and dismantled Beyond. However, she was forever scarred by such an experience, having her personality drastically changed by it.{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 1}}

More recently, Rambeau, adopting the alias of '''Spectrum''', became a prominent super-hero, being part of teams such as the [[Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]],{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 1}} the [[Ultimates (Earth-616)|Ultimates]],{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 1}} and [[Strikeforce (Earth-616)|Strikeforce]].{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 5}} As her power levels were significantly augmented,{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 3}} Rambeau struggled with feeling distant from her sense of humanity. Unexpectedly, after battling the goddess of the night, [[Nyx (Earth-616)|Nyx]], her powers declined, allowing her to become human again.{{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 10}}

| History                 = 
===Origins===
'''Monica Rambeau''' was born and raised in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana (State)|Louisiana]]. She is the daughter of [[Maria Rambeau (Earth-616)|Maria Rambeau]], a successful seamstress, and firefighter [[Frank Rambeau (Earth-616)|Frank Rambeau]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 246}} She worked as a [[New Orleans Harbor Patrol (Earth-616)|New Orleans Harbor Patrol]] lieutenant and, as a black woman, faced difficulties to ascend to the rank of captain. Fate came upon her one day when she met [[Andre LeClare (Earth-616)|Professor André LeClare]], a friend of her late grandfather, who approached her seeking help in retrieving a energy-draining device which had been usurped by his rogue assistant, [[Felipe Picaro (Earth-616)|Felipe Picaro]]. Rambeau traveled with LeClare by bravely captaining a boat to a [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]] oil rig on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. She infiltrated the oil tower by gaining Picaro's trust. Regrettably, LeClare was found by security guards when trying to deactivate the dangerous mechanism, revealing their plan. When Picaro attempted to use the energy disruptor to obliterate [[Fort Benning]], Rambeau destroyed the equipment with her bare hands and gained superpowers by being bombarded with extra-dimensional energy.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 16}}

[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 16 003.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Monica Rambeau gains powers]]
With the ability to convert her body mass into any form of electromagnetic energy, Rambeau found herself back to New Orleans, where she designed a super-hero costume by combining pieces of Mardi Gras outfits from a storage warehouse. With her new powers, she returned to the oil rig, rescuing LeClare and preventing the disruptor from damaging the fabric of the universe. Her actions caught the attention of the media, which referred to her as '''Captain Marvel'''. Finally a captain by her own merit, Rambeau decided to resign from the navy.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #16}}

===Avenger===
Weeks later, Captain Marvel visited [[New York City]], seeking [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]]' help to keep her power levels stable. There, she was spotted by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], whose spider-sense led him to believe she might pose a threat. At the [[Baxter Building]], the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] suggested her to contact the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] since Richards was not available. In the [[Avengers Mansion]], after clearing up a brief misunderstanding with Spider-Man, Captain Marvel was finally assisted by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], who siphoned the excessive energy from her body.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #16}}

[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 16 001.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Captain Marvel arrives in New York City]]
The [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] then invited Captain Marvel to become an Avenger-in-training. [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Jarvis]] took this opportunity to introduce Rambeau to the history of the previous Captain Marvel, the [[Kree]] alien [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Mar-Vell]].{{r|Avengers #227}} Captain Marvel soon proved to be an inspirational addition to the team as seen in her first adventure against [[Elihas Starr (Earth-616)|Egghead]]'s [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]], during the trial of [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 229|230}}

Captain Marvel rapidly earned full Avengers membership and took part in several missions, such as saving [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] and the [[Ronald Reagan (Earth-616)|president]] from [[Samuel Smithers (Earth-616)|Plantman]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 231|232}} helping the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] fight the [[Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)|Leader]],{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 281|284}} preventing [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]] from invading Earth{{r|Avengers Vol 1 233}} and defeating [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus the Mad]] alongside the [[House of Agon (Earth-616)|Inhumans]].{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 12}} During this initial period of her super-hero career, she dwelt on not feeling worthy of Mar-Vell's mantle, especially because she was working with one of Mar-Vell's closest friends, the Avenger [[Eros (Earth-616)|Starfox]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 232}} Regardless, as time passed by, Captain Marvel became a respected heroine, accomplishing additional victories over the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 235}} [[Marcus Daniels (Earth-616)|Blackout]] and [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Moonstone]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 236|238}} [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan le Fay]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 240|241}} and the [[Dire Wraiths]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 244|245}}

[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 233 001.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Energy form]]
In between her activities as an Avenger, Captain Marvel also dealt with personal affairs. Being able to travel at the speed of light, she maintained residence in New Orleans. There, she managed to invest her money in a boat to satisfy her love for captaining ships and planned to set up a small naval business in the future.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 236|238}} Moreover, as being part of the group of Avengers that were unwillingly transported to [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]] by the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]], Captain Marvel found herself worried about keeping her parents ignorant of her dangerous double life as a super-hero.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 242|243}} Fortunately, upon learning the truth, her parents expressed how proud they were of their daughter being an Avenger, even though they worried deeply for her safety.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 246|247}}

During a bizarre solar eclipse, the Avengers Mansion was infiltrated by the [[Symbiotes (Race)|mysterious shadow parasite]] known as [[Mister E (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Mister E]], Captain Marvel got infected, and her teammate [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]] was gravely wounded, having his [[Ebony Blade]] stolen. The duo found unexpected help in the form of their enemy, [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]], and his ally [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]]. Joined by Spider-Man, Captain Marvel and the unusual group followed Mister E to [[Knowhere]].{{r|Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 3}} There, Captain Marvel managed to hurt Mister E, separating it from its host, [[Alistaire Smythe (Earth-616)|Alistaire Smythe]]. It was revealed by the [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Watcher]] that the Ebony Blade was an artifact capable of hurting Mister E's master, the king in black [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]. For that reason, the Watcher had sent [[Ulik (Earth-616)|Ulik the Troll]] to wield it.{{r|Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 4}} Captain Marvel turned out to wield the Ebony Blade instead, under the Watcher's guide, managed to kill Mister E. Later on, Captain Marvel plunged the Ebony Blade into the darkness that covered the Sun, restoring its light. Knull, from his [[Klyntar (Location)|prison]], felt her attack and swore revenge against his aggressor.{{r|Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 5}}

When the organization know as [[Population Reduction by Inter-Dimensional Expulsion (Earth-616)|P.R.I.D.E.]] attempted to steal [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]]'s [[Technafoil]] and New York Maritime museum's [[Windstone Jewel]], Captain Marvel found herself teaming up with Spider-Man again to stop the robbers. At P.R.I.D.E.'s headquarters, the super-hero duo learns that [[Eric Paulson (Earth-616)|Dr. Paulson]] planned to solve Earth's overpopulation problem by banishing people to another dimension. Although the threat was eliminated by Captain Marvel and Spider-Man, the former found herself trapped in her light form after the battle for being exposed to P.R.I.D.E.'s technology.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 1 142}} With Starfox's help, Spider-Man travelled to the other dimension to deactivate P.R.I.D.E.'s generation and restore Captain Marvel's control over her powers.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 1 143}}

[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) and Eros (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 250 001.jpg|thumb|125px|left|Praised by Starfox for her bravery]]
After [[Maelstrom (Earth-616)|Maelstrom]] and [[Deathurge (Earth-616)|Deathurge]] stroke against the [[Eternals (Homo immortalis)|Eternals]] and were defeated by the Avengers,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 246|248}} Maelstrom and his minions decided to target Earth's rotation patterns. Professor LeClare informed Captain Marvel about the dangerous consequences of this phenomenon, but, before she could contact the Avengers, she had her mind tampered with by [[Phobius (Earth-616)|Phobius]]. Ultimately, Captain Marvel managed to overcome her artificial fear and assisted the Avengers and the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]] in defeating Maelstrom for good. Following this event, Starfox proudly shared that Monica represented an honorable tribute to Mar-Vell's memory.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 249|250}}

When the Avengers chairman, the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], was corrupted by the [[Titan (Moon of Saturn)|Titanian]] intelligence known as [[Integral Synaptic Anti-Anionic Computer (Earth-616)|I.S.A.A.C.]], he tricked Captain Marvel into investigating a fake signal emanating from [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos']] starship, [[Sanctuary (Vehicle)|Sanctuary II]], which was adrift in Pluto's orbit.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 252}} As she explored the dreadnought, she met a group of deceitful space pirates who teleported her to the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], aiming to force her into their mercenary squad.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 255}} In order to protect herself, Captain Marvel learned how to create a hologram of herself using her powers, by staying in energy form but maintaining a powerless appearance.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 256}} However, she was unable to fool the crew's commander, the deadly [[Nebula (Earth-616)|Nebula]], who blackmailed her into attacking a Skrull planetoid-base, as a part of a plan of conquering the [[Skrull Empire]], recently weakened by [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]]' actions.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 257}}

[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 256 001.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Creating a hologram of herself to fool Nebula]]
During the attack, Captain Marvel managed to contact the Avengers right before Nebula attempted to obliterate the planetoid using an anti-matter torpedo. The base was protected from destruction by Captain Marvel, who forged an alliance with Skrull [[Zedrao (Earth-616)|General Zedrao]] and was eventually met by the Avengers, who had received her distress call.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 258|259}} The Avengers set their plan in motion to stop Nebula's invasion, with Captain Marvel being able to use her powers to power Sanctuary II's shields down. Unexpectedly, Nebula was teleported away by the Beyonder, who wished to assist the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 260}} With the Skrulls' help, the Avengers tracked Nebula to [[Kral IV|Kral]]. The Avengers teamed up with the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] to defeat the terrorist [[Zabyk (Earth-616)|Zabyk]], who detonated his [[Hyperwave Bomb]], a device similar to the one which granted Captain Marvel her powers.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 14}} After this conflict, Captain Marvel was finally able to return to Earth with the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 261}}

When [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] was captured by the Beyonder, the Avengers chairwoman, the Wasp, could not be found. Captain Marvel's tenability made her be chosen by the other Avengers to lead the mission.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 265}} The Beyonder was ultimately killed, but not before damaging Earth's core, leading Captain Marvel to ask for the help of the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] and of the [[Owen Reece (Earth-616)|Molecule Man]] to restore it.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 266}}

[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 276 001.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Trapped inside the [[Darkforce Dimension]]]]
Some time later, the Avengers confronted Kang the Conqueror, when Captain Marvel learned about some limitations of her abilities, such as her vulnerability to [[Darkforce|darkforce]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 267|269}} When the Avengers became targets of a variety of seemingly unrelated super-villains, Captain Marvel was put in contact with FBI agent [[Derek Freeman (Earth-616)|Derek Freeman]], whom she flirted with. Also around this period, her teammate Black Knight helped her comprehend her powers better.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 270|271}} The recent attacks against the Avengers were revealed to have been orchestrated by [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616|Baron Zemo]] and his Masters of Evil. In order to invade and destroy the Avengers Mansion, neutralizing Captain Marvel became one of their priorities.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 273}} She was tricked by Blackout, who trapped her in the [[Darkforce Dimension]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 274|275}} Captain Marvel only found her way out through another darkforce manipulator, the [[Maximillian Coleridge (Earth-616)|Shroud]]. She turned her attention back to the Avengers Mansion, where she took care of Blackout and Moonstone.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 276}} Captain Marvel then teamed up with the other Avengers to defeat and arrest Zemo, helping them to cope with the fact that their home had been violated by their enemies.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 277}}

===Avengers Chairwoman===
[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) and Steven Rogers (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 279 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Accepting the offer to be the Avengers chairwoman]]
Following the battle against the Masters of Evil, the Wasp decided to take a leave of absence from the team{{r|Avengers Vol 1 278}} and Captain Marvel was nominated to become the new Avengers chairwoman. Under her parents' advice, she decided to accept the offer.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 279}} As her first crisis as a leader, Captain Marvel dealt with the disappearance of one of her teammates, the comatose [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]]. The Avengers were subsequently captured by Hercules' relatives as [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus]] blamed them for his son's condition. Captain Marvel was knocked out by [[Artemis (Olympian) (Earth-616)|Artemis]] and [[Hermes Diaktoros (Earth-616)|Hermes]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 281}} Imprisoned by [[Hades (Earth-616)|Pluto]] in [[Tartarus (Hades)|Tartarus]], the Avengers were liberated by [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] and went to the [[Olympus (City)|City of Olympus]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 282|283}} Personally confronting Zeus, Captain Marvel managed to wake Hercules up, and the Avengers defeated the Olympians.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 284|285}}

Captain Marvel's past came to haunt her when she was contacted by LeClare concerning her powers. This contact was in fact an ambush plan orchestrated by Picaro, who managed to affect Captain Marvel's energy form, causing it to be uncontrollable and hurt her. After messaging the real LeClare, Captain Marvel learned about the ruse. Picaro blackmailed Captain Marvel into transferring her powers to him by threatening LeClare's life. However, Captain Marvel managed to overpower Picaro's siphoning suit and incapacitated him.{{r|Solo Avengers Vol 1 2}}

[[File:Avengers Vol 1 291 Promo.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Leading the Avengers]]
Weeks later, Captain Marvel received from Derek Freeman information about the [[Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|Fixer]], one of the Masters of Evil. As the Avengers tried to capture the Fixer, Captain Marvel's actions as a field leader were secretly sabotaged by her teammate [[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Doctor Druid]], who tampered with the other Avengers' minds.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 286|287}} Discredited as a leader, Captain Marvel performed poorly in a following conflict against the [[Super-Adaptoid (Earth-616)|Super-Adaptoid]] and his robotic allies, getting herself and the other Avengers kidnapped.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 288|289}} The group was ultimately saved by Captain America.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 290}}

[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 294 001.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Powerless and debilitated after her accident]]
Doctor Druid's machinations to undermine Captain Marvel had severe consequences. When Namor's wife, [[Marrina Smallwood (Earth-616)|Marrina]], lost control over her abilities, Captain Marvel turned herself into lightning to boost an attack performed by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] on the ocean. As a result she went missing in action.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 291|293}} A heavily injured Captain Marvel was then found by the Avengers. As her energy form scattered in the water, she found herself in a very debilitated state and was unable to activate her powers. Forced to leave the active roster, Captain Marvel was once more psychically manipulated by Doctor Druid and unwillingly appointed him as the new Avengers chairman.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 294}} Her dismissal ultimately caused the fall of the Avengers as a team.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 297}}

===Reborn===
After a long recovering time,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 305}} Monica Rambeau started working as the captain of a cargo ship. When her ship was hijacked in the [[Caribbean Sea]] by [[Frank Skorina (Earth-616)|Powderkeg]] and his minions, Captain Marvel witnessed the return of her energy-based abilities. Even though her powers behaved differently, she managed to overpower Powderkeg, but her actions caught the attention of Brazilian crime-lord [[Kristina Ramos (Earth-616)|Kristina Ramos]]. Captain Marvel learned about Ramos from her employer, [[Ron Morgan (Earth-616)|Ron Morgan]], and decided to travel to [[Rio de Janeiro (City)|Rio]] to recover a piece of [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark]] technology Ramos had stolen. In Rio, Captain Marvel found her former adversary, Moonstone, and a battle ensued. Although Captain Marvel was victorious, she was subsequently attacked by Ramos, who wore a [[Guardsman Armor]]. With the assistance of [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|Jim Rhodes]], Captain Marvel defeated Ramos. Able to rely on her powers once again, she was also put in charge of Morgan's shipping business.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 2 1}}

[[File:Captain Marvel Vol 2 1 Textless.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Captain Marvel reborn!]]
Now recovered, Captain Marvel assisted the Avengers sporadically as a reserve member, such as when she fought in the battle to prevent the return of [[Set (Earth-616)|Set]],{{r|Atlantis Attacks}} assisted other reserve Avengers to combat [[Awesome Android (Earth-616)|Awesome Android]] at the fallen [[Hydrobase]],{{r|Avengers Spotlight Vol 1 27}}, and helped to destroy [[Terminus (Destroyer) (Earth-616)|Terminus]].{{r|Terminus Factor}}. With the Avengers exiled in another dimension during a press conference, Captain Marvel even stepped in as chairwoman once again for a brief moment.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 330}} Captain Marvel also acted as a solo hero in New Orleans, where she managed to bond herself with more mundane issues of the world.{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 57}}

When Earth was under threat due to the [[Operation Galactic Storm|war between the Kree and the Shi'ar]], the Avengers dispatched different teams to solve the conflict. Captain Marvel was assigned to lead the squadron sent to the [[Shi'ar Galaxy]] in order to convince the Imperium to stop using the [[Sol|Solar System]] [[Stargate]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 345}} Believed to be allies of the Kree, the Avengers were brutally attacked by the Shi'ar [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]], being ambushed by the Shi'ar armada.{{r|Thor Vol 1 445}} As Captain Marvel attempted to negociate with the Shi'ar Empire,{{r|Quasar Vol 1 33}} the Avengers learned about [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Shi'ar Majestrix Lilandra]]'s intentions of detonating a [[Nega-Bombs|Nega-Bomb]] in the Kree space by transporting it through Earth.{{r|Wonder Man Vol 2 8}} 

[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) and Eric Masterson (Earth-616) from Thor Vol 1 446 0001.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Leading the Avengers during the Kree/Shi'ar War]]
Unable to reason with the Shi'ar, Captain Marvel decided to assist them in fighting the Kree [[Starforce (Earth-616)|Starforce]] to gain their trust.{{r|Thor Vol 1 446}} Captain Marvel's plans were foiled by her ill-tempered teammate [[Eric Masterson (Earth-616)|Thor]], leading to a battle against the Shi'ar [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]]. After the combat, although Lilandra was convinced that Earth was at peril, the Nega-Bomb had disappeared, a ploy orchestrated by Skrulls.{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 2 82}} With [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]]'s assistance, Captain Marvel's team attempted to prevent the catastrophical explosion, with no success, as the bomb detonated in the Kree Empire.{{r|Wonder Man Vol 2 9}} As it was revealed that this annihilation had been planned by the [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Kree Supreme Intelligence]], who wished to decimate of his own people by activating the Nega-Bomb in order to jumpstart Kree evolution, the Avengers suffered an ideological split-up. While Iron Man decided that the Intelligence should be killed, Captain America fought to spare his life. Captain Marvel sided with Captain America. However, the Intelligence was ultimately slain.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 347}}

Following the war, Captain Marvel operated both in New Orleans and New York City. One day, she found Asian immigrants being attacked by members of the racist organization known as the [[Sons of the Serpent (Earth-616)|Sons of the Serpent]] at the [[Empire State University]]. Captain Marvel was then approached by her former partner, Derek Freeman, who asked for her help in protecting his nephew, an E.S.U. activist named [[Raymond Washington (Earth-616)|Ray Washington]], who was a potential target of the Sons of the Serpent. During an event, the Sons of the Serpent made their move. Captain Marvel intervened and defeated them, but was surprised by their leader, [[Edward Cross (Skinhead) (Earth-616)|Skinhead]]. Teaming up with [[Robert Farrell (Earth-616)|Rocket Racer]], Captain Marvel managed to incapacitate Skinhead and diminish the prejudice-motivated movements at E.S.U.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 2 2}}

[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) and Genis-Vell (Earth-616) from Avengers Unplugged Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Meeting Genis-Vell]]
When the son of the original Captain Marvel, [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Genis-Vell]], publicly adopted the name Captain Marvel to honor his father's legacy, he caught Rambeau's attention.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 3 2}} The two Marvels finally met when Rambeau was brainwashed and kidnapped by the super-villain known as the [[Basil Sandhurst (Earth-616)|Controller]], being forced to attack Starfox and Genis-Vell in Titan. Even though Rambeau was not in full control of her actions, she wisely summoned other Avengers to assist her, expecting them to stop the battle and free her. As the Vision released Rambeau from the Controller's influence as she had wished, the Avengers chased down and defeated the villain. Agreeing to concede the Captain Marvel title to Genis-Vell, Monica Rambeau adopted the alias '''Photon''', a named that was suited to her abilities.{{r|Avengers: Unplugged Vol 1 5}}

When the Avengers reassembled after the [[Onslaught (Event)|Onslaught crisis]], Photon reunited with her former team at the Avengers Mansion.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 2}} The group was attacked by [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]], who reshaped reality into a medieval setting which she ruled. The Avengers acted as her minions, the [[Queen’s Vengeance (Earth-398)|Queen's Vengeance]], and Photon became "Daystar". Photon was one of the few Avengers to realize the true nature behind Morgan's illusion, alongside Captain America, the Wasp, [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], Thor, Quasar, and [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]]. The small group eventually managed to attack the Queen's Vengeance, allowing the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] to restore reality.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 3}}

Back to New Orleans, Rambeau started a boat charter service business with her father. When the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]] attacked New Orleans, Photon sought the Avengers for help, as she was unable to defeat them by herself. During the fight, Photon was incapacitated and taken as a hostage by the villains.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 16}} The Wrecking Crew used Photon's powers as battery to feed them, seizing control of the realm of [[Polemachus]].{{r|Avengers Vol 3 17}} Photon eventually managed to overload the supply and break the circuit that maintained the Wrecking Crew's power, allowing Thor to knock them out.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 18}}

By working with her father, Photon realized she missed being a super-hero. Much to her mother's dislike, she came back to Avengers duty when recruited by Quasar to confront the mysterious [[Infinites (Cosmic Beings)|Infinites]], which dangerously caused destruction in the galaxy. The Avengers, trying to protect the galaxy, found [[Jonathan Hart (Earth-616)|Jack of Hearts]] in [[R-76]].{{r|Avengers: Infinity Vol 1 1}} Photon then had disagreements with Thor regarding the actions of the team, as Thor recklessly dove into battles.{{r|Avengers: Infinity Vol 1 2}} Venturing across the galaxy to solve the mystery regarding the Infinites, the Avengers summoned [[Eternity (Multiverse)|Eternity]] to help them. Their point of view as human heroes ultimately convinced the Infinites to stop their activities. Ultimately, Photon also made amends with Thor.{{r|{{cl|Avengers: Infinity Vol 1 3}}-[[Avengers: Infinity Vol 1 4|4]]}}

In [[Selandiar]], Photon and the Avengers learned that Earth had been quarantined and turned into a intergalactic prison. They approached Majestrix Lilandra about this decision with no success in reverting it. Attacked by the Kree Supreme Intelligence, the Avengers were told about his secret plan of eliminating life on Earth to serve his nefarious purposes.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 35}} Managing to escape from the Kree, the Avengers uncovered the truth and were successful in saving Earth.{{r|Maximum Security Vol 1 3}}

Back to Earth, Photon was summoned by Captain America to fight [[Sean Dolan (Earth-616)|Bloodwraith]] in [[Slorenia]].{{r|Avengers Vol 3 36}} Simulteanously, she also assisted the other Avengers in confronting [[Pagan (Earth-616)|Pagan]] and [[Lord Templar (Tremont) (Earth-616)|Lord Templar]] in [[Central Park]]. All three villains vanished after the Avengers overpowered them.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 37}} As a reserve Avenger, Photon keep aiding the group by operating the [[Avengers Deep-Space Monitoring Station]] alongside Quasar and [[Miguel Santos (Earth-616)|Living Lightning]].{{r|Avengers Vol 3 38}} She momentarily came back to active duty when Kang the Conqueror took over the world and the Avengers fought back.{{r|Kang Dynasty}} After the Avengers disassembled, once again Genis-Vell took Rambeau's alias without her consent by rebranding himself as Photon. After a talk with him, she contemplated adopting the new alias of "Pulsar", although she never did.{{r|New Thunderbolts Vol 1 8|9}} 

===Agent of H.A.T.E.===
When [[Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort (Earth-63163)|H.A.T.E. (Highest Anti-Terrorism Effort)]], a subsidiary of the [[Beyond Corporation (Multiverse)|Beyond Corporation©]], formed a super-hero squad called [[Nextwave (Earth-63163)|Nextwave]] to allegedly combat terrorism, Monica Rambeau was hired to act as their field leader under [[Dirk Anger (Earth-63163)|General Dirk Anger]]'s supervision. The unusual group comprised robot supremacist [[Aaron Stack (Impostor) (Earth-616)|Aaron Stack]], monster hunter [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]], the onstentatious mutant [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Tabby Smith]], and the mysterious [[Captain (Nextwave) (Earth-616)|Captain]]. Upon learning through Beyond Corporation©'s Marketing Plan that they were funded by illegal weapon testing activities, Rambeau went rogue on Anger and decided to use Nextwave to sabotage Beyond©.{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Nextwave (Earth-63163) from Nextwave Vol 1 5 Cover.jpg|275px|thumb|left|Leading the Nextwave Squad]]
In their first operation, the Nextwave Squad attacked a Beyond© construction site in [[Abcess]], [[North Dakota (State)|North Dakota]], that hid the gigantic monster [[Fin Fang Foom (Earth-63163)|Fin Fang Foom]], which Beyond© intended to weaponize.{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 1}} After killing the monster,{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 2}} the Nextwave Squad went to [[Sink City]], [[Illinois]], to track more of Beyond©'s activities. There, they fought the cyborg cop [[Mac Mangel (Earth-63163)|Mac Mangel]] and kept on their journey to put Beyond© down.{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 3|4}} In [[War Garden 6]], [[Wyoming (State)|Wyoming]], Rambeau decided to annihilate Beyond©'s Human Resources crops when Anger, for the first time, had the chance to retaliate. Unleashing a burst of ultraviolet radiation, Rambeau incapacitated Anger's forces and then threatened him using X-rays. Anger eventually retreated when blackmailed by Stack.{{r|{{cl|Nextwave Vol 1 5}}-[[Nextwave Vol 1 6|6]]}} Moving to [[Shotcreek]], [[Colorado]], Nextwave prevented a demonic invasion ordered by Beyond©, with Rambeau specifically torturing [[Rorkannu (Earth-63163)|Rorkannu]], the demon-lord responsible for it.{{r|{{cl|Nextwave Vol 1 7}}-[[Nextwave Vol 1 8|8]]}}

[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) from Nextwave Vol 1 12 002.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Beyond© is no more]]
Through their investigation, Nextwave found themselves in a ghost city, which was in fact a lure planned by Beyond© to capture them. After defeating their opponents, Nextwave was caught in illusions projected by the [[Irving Forbush (Earth-63163)|Forbush Man]]. Rambeau experienced visions related to the original Captain Marvel's adventures. Broken free by Tabby Smith, Rambeau decided to end Beyond© for good by invading their base in [[State 51]].{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 9|10}} Nextwave was followed by Anger, who perished before he could destroy his former employees. Then, they ultimately learned the identities of the masterminds behind Beyond©: [[Number None (Earth-63163)|Number None]] and [[Devil Dinosaur (Earth-63163)|Devil Dinosaur]]. Unable to touch Nextwave, the duo was defeated and slain. With the Beyond Corporation© dismantled, Monica Rambeau and Nextwave could do anything they wanted.{{r|{{cl|Nextwave Vol 1 11}}-[[Nextwave Vol 1 12|12]]}} However, Nextwave's activities with Beyond© were claimed to their members to be delusional memories, causing the group to ignore their period as Agents of H.A.T.E.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 6}}

===Marvel Diva===
After Louisiana was hit by Hurricane Katrina, Rambeau and her father worked hard to help people in need. She was then recruited by the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] to fend off a vampire outbreak in [[New Orleans]], as part of a team-up also comprising [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]], [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]], and [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Brother Voodoo]]. Black Panther pushed Rambeau's powers to new limits, exposing her natural advantage against vampires due to her light-based abilities.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 12|13}} During this period, she started a relationship with Brother Voodoo, although it did not work well as Voodoo wished for a serious relationship while Rambeau did not.{{r|Marvel Divas Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Erik Killmonger (Earth-616) and Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) from Black Panther Vol 4 38 001.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Killing Killmonger]]
Rambeau joined Captain America's [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] to resist the [[Superhuman Registration Act]],{{r|Civil War (Event)}} where she once again worked with Black Panther, an opportunity for her to further explore her abilities.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 24|25}} Some time later, Black Panther's nemesis, [[Erik Killmonger (Earth-616)|Killmonger]], took his sister [[Shuri (Earth-616)|Shuri]] hostage in [[Niganda]]. In order to assist the Panther, Iron Man sent Rambeau to Shuri's rescue. However, Killmonger subdued and captured her.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 35|36}} After being tortured by the [[Mutant Baboon (Earth-616)|Baboon]],{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 37}} Rambeau finally escaped and slayed Killmonger in a burst of rage.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 38}}

Back to America, Rambeau participated in a speed-dating event. Although she could not find a romantic partner, she formed a strong friendship bond with fellow heroines [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]], [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Firestar]] and [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]], who also attended the event. The female four constantly teamed up both to fight evil and to hang out. During Hellcat's book-release party, Rambeau revealed she was constantly being contacted by her former lover Brother Voodoo. Simulteanously, she also was struck by the revelation that Firestar had acquired breast cancer.{{r|Marvel Divas Vol 1 1}}

Voodoo asked Rambeau's help in retrieving the legendary wish-granting artifact known as the [[Monkey's Paw]]. As she agreed to aid him, they rekindled their relationship in the process.{{r|Marvel Divas Vol 1 2}} After acquiring the Monkey's Paw in an auction,{{r|Marvel Divas Vol 1 3}} Rambeau used its powers to teleport herself and her friends to [[Hell]] to rescue Hellcat from her ex-husband, [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]]. Upon their return to Earth and Firestar's slow recovery, the four female friends celebrated their friendship.{{r|Marvel Divas Vol 1 4}} Some time later, Rambeau attended [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]'s birthday party in [[Las Vegas]], where she helped solve a cosmic crisis involving [[Frankie Raye (Earth-616)|Frankie Raye]] alongside other female heroes.{{r|{{cl|Heralds Vol 1 1}}-[[Nextwave Vol 1 5|5]]}}

[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) from Captain Marvel Vol 7 7 001.jpg|thumb|right|125px|Greeting Carol Danvers, the new Captain Marvel]]
When boats went vanishing in New Orleans, Rambeau contacted [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol Danvers]], the newest Captain Marvel, to help her investigate as she prefered not to use her powers underwater again. Rambeau worked with Danvers' former coworker, the journalist [[Frank Gianelli (Earth-616)|Frank Gianelli]]. When Danvers and Gianelli were attacked by a giant robot designed by [[Hogarth Hamontree (Earth-616)|Dr. Hogarth Hamontree]] and responsible for the recent disappearances, Rambeau joined them to end the threat. By using her energy form to feed Danvers' powers, the enemy was destroyed.{{r|{{cl|Captain Marvel Vol 7 7}}-[[Captain Marvel Vol 7 8|8]]}}

===Mighty Avenger===
Trying to rebrand her image to distance herself from the Nextwave Squad, Rambeau adopted a new alias of '''Spectrum''', acting as a vigilante in New York City, arresting villains such as the [[Jonathan Swift (Earth-616)|Blue Streak]]. Around this period, she was approached by her former partner Blade. However, before he could share his intentions with her, they noticed that the city was being attacked by [[Proxima Midnight (Earth-616)|Proxima Midnight]], one of Thanos' lieutenants. The Mad Titan Thanos took advantage of the abscence of Avengers on Earth to launch an invasion. As a group of heroes formed by Spectrum, Blade, Luke Cage and [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] banded together to protect the people, the [[Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]] were born.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 1}} 

[[File:Mighty Avengers (Earth-616) from Mighty Avengers Vol 2 3 002.jpg|175px|left|thumb|Spectrum and the Mighty Avengers]]
During the fight, Spectrum was infected with anti-photons from [[Proxima Midnight's Spear]]. [[Adam Brashear (Earth-616)|Blue Marvel]] joined the group of heroes and saved Spectrum's life by infusing her body with additional photons. The infection was burned out and, as a side effect, Spectrum's powers were immensely augmented. Although the villainess retreated, the Mighty Avengers found themselves fighting [[Shuma-Gorath (Multiverse)|Shuma-Gorath]], who had invaded the mortal plane. The demon was ultimately fended off by Spectrum's new powers.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 2|3}} 

The Mighty Avengers, led by Cage and based at the [[Gem Theater]], offered their services to the local community. After the fall of [[Attilan]], they went to investigate its ruins. There, the Avengers found many new adversaries in the form of the [[Deathwalkers (Earth-616)|Deathwalkers]], [[Cortex Incorporated (Earth-616)|Cortex Inc.]] and even Spider-Man.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 4.INH|5}} When Spectrum's teammate, [[Ava Ayala (Earth-616)|White Tiger]] sought revenge against [[Gideon Mace (Earth-616)|Gideon Mace]], Spectrum tricked her in order to prevent a regrettable murder.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 6|7}}

Spectrum also started to have contact with characters from her period with Nextwave, causing her to question the veracity of her attack against the Beyond Corporation©. Meanwhile, Blade's intentions by contacting Spectrum were eventually revealed to concern the Deathwalkers, who wished to destroy the human world.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 10}} Spectrum then led the Mighty Avengers to save Blade, Cage and Blue Marvel from the Deathwalkers and the group finished them for good.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 14}}

When Cage and the new [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America]] had their morals inverted by a spell, Cage attempted to sell the rights of the Mighty Avengers to Cortex Inc. much to the team's disappointment.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 2}} The Mighty Avengers were then forced to fight [[Axis (Avengers) (Earth-616)|a group of inverted Avengers]], with Spectrum leading her friends against Cage and Captain America.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 3}} After the inversion faded out,{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 4}} Spectrum figured out with Blue Marvel's help that she had transcended humanity with her power-up, having become an immortal being made of light.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 5}}

[[File:Monica Rambeau (Earth-616) from Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 6.jpg|right|left|thumb|150px|Spectrum recollects her memories as an agent of H.A.T.E.]]
As the Avengers investigated Cortex Inc., they learned that the company was a mere façade for the Beyond Corporation©. Spectrum came to the realization that her memories as an Agent of H.A.T.E. with the Nextwave Squad were genuine and sought for revenge.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 6}} Confronting the CEO of Cortex, [[Jason Quantrell (Earth-616)|Jason Quantrell]], Spectrum learned that many of her memories and even her personality had been manipulated by Beyond© in the past. With Blue Marvel's assistance, Quantrell was banished to outside reality and Spectrum found some peace.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 7}}

When the [[Incursion|incursion crisis]] that caused to the early end of the Multiverse became public, Steve Rogers came to the Mighty Avengers for help. Under Spectrum's advice, the group joined him in fighting the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]], who had taken care of the problem for months in secrecy by employing dubious methods. Blue Marvel and Spectrum confronted Reed Richards and the Black Panther about their irresponsible actions and decided to act where they failed, by being open about their actions.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 8}} During the final incursion, Spectrum prepared herself to obliterate the [[Earth-1610|opposing Earth]] and prevent the end of the Multiverse, but hesitated and was intercepted by [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]] and the [[City (Earth-1610)|City]].{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 9}}

===Ultimates===
Following the death and rebirth of the Multiverse and the dissolution of the Mighty Avengers,{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 9}} Spectrum joined the newly formed [[Ultimates (Earth-616)|Ultimates]] at Blue Marvel's suggestion, a proactive group that would fill in the vacuum left by the Illuminati.{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 1}} As one of their first actions, the Ultimates transformed [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] into a being of creation, a lifebringer.{{r|{{cl|Ultimates Vol 3 1}}-[[Ultimates Vol 3 2|2]]}}

The Ultimates' proactive nature led them to become interested in the use of the precognitive abilities of the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses Cain]]. When Captain Marvel predicted that Thanos would invade a [[Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. (Earth-616)|Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.]] base for a [[Cosmic Cube]], the Ultimates intervened. Their action costed the life of Jim Rhodes. Affected by this loss, Spectrum and Blue Marvel found comfort by exploring romantic feelings for each other.{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 8}} Due to their differences on predictive justice, the Ultimates fought among themselves and ultimately were dissolved right after their last fight against Thanos.{{r|{{cl|Ultimates Vol 3 10}}-[[Ultimates Vol 3 12|12]]}}

[[File:Ultimates 2 Vol 2 1 Textless.jpg|180px|thumb|right|The problem solver Ultimates]]
Regardless of their dissolution, the Ultimates later reassembled in secret at the request of Galactus in order to investigate the imprisonment of the embodiment of the Multiverse, Eternity.{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 1}} After unveiling the mystery by fighting the [[Troubleshooters (Earth-616)|Troubleshoooters]], the Ultimates were reactivated and incorporated into the [[Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] program.{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 4|6}} Spectrum and other Alpha Flight operatives dealt with a [[Chitauri]] invasion on Earth orbit while the locked-down planet was controlled by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]].{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 7}} Later, with Eternity's jailer, the [[First Firmament (First Cosmos)|First Firmament]], finally defeated, the Ultimates disbanded. Spectrum and Blue Marvel decided to focus on their relationship and to dedicate their lives for scientific research.{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 1 100}}

===In the Dark===
When the Greek goddess of the night, [[Nyx (Earth-616)|Nyx]], and her children returned and massacred their fellow Olympians, Spectrum was one of several heroes assembled by the would-be heroine [[Va Nee Gast (Earth-616)|Voyager]] to stop this new threat before she could reclaim her godhood and remake the universe in her dark image. One of Spectrum's companions in this journey was the Vision, who was being assisted by her and Blue Marvel as his body was malfunctioning {{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 1}} Spectrum's light-based powers proved to be exceptionally effective against Nyx{{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 2}} and, teaming up with the Scarlet Witch, she was able to counter Nyx's darkness.{{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 5}} Moreover, due to Nyx causing the Sun to blackout, Spectrum used her powers to provide Vision an alternative source of solar energy to counter-attack the villainess.{{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 7}}

During this battle, Spectrum as particularly worried about the lost of her humanity, as her extremely high power levels caused her to be essentially an immortal being made of light rather than a human being made of flesh and bone.{{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 8}} However, at the end of the battle, the Avengers reached entry point to the [[House of Ideas]], a plane of existence which was the core of all of creation. Spectrum burned out most of her power helping Vision reach inside the House of Ideas, as he was the only hero capable to follow Nyx and stop her. Due to this exertion, Spectrum returned to her former power levels, essentially becoming human again. Joining Blue Marvel and his [[Avengers World (Earth-616)|Avengers World]], she decided to enjoy her mortal life.{{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 10}}

Soon after, Spectrum was part of a random group of super-human beings who got impersonated by the shape-shifting monsters known as [[Vridai]], who had stolen a set of deadly diseases from a research compound. The Avengers restrained the group of heroes for investigation, but Blade, knowing about the Vridai's nature, freed Spectrum and the others from the Avengers and asked for the group's help to stop the knowledge about the monsters from spreading out.{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 1}} In [[Las Vegas]], Spectrum used the electric energy of the city to counterattack the Vridai, although they managed to kidnap her ally, [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]].{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 2}} In [[Indonesia]], Wiccan was rescued, while the Vridai's leader, [[Ophidian (Earth-616)|Count Ophidian]], was found and captured instead.{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 3}} The group of heroes decided to make their alliance official and started to call themselves [[Strikeforce (Earth-616)|Strikeforce]] under Blade's suggestion.{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 5}}

After Spectrum started to manifest unexplainable seizures, it was soon revealed she was being manipulated by the [[Ghost (Earth-616)|Ghost]]. The Ghost was tracked down by Strikeforce to a Health Center in [[Lakeside County]], [[Michigan]]. As Spectrum infiltrated the hospital, she learned that the Ghost had been experimenting with resurrection. Additionally, the bizarre project's head doctor was revealed to be Moonstone, who tricked Spectrum into using her powers to stabilize the method of raising the dead.{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 5}} As Spectrum temporarily nullified Moonstone's powers and defeated her, she collected and released the life energy of the dead patients, allowing them to rest in peace.{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 6}}

The quest to stop the Vridai led Strikeforce to the monsters' former home, [[Svartalfheim]], in order to attack the true mastermind behind their invasion, Ophidian's advisor [[Birgit (Earth-616)|Birgit]].{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 7|8}} With Birgit defeated, the Vridai found asylum on [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]]'s [[Monster Island]]. Given the success of their mission, the Avengers offered Strikeforce an official status as a task force. They unanimously refused the offer, but realized that a friendship bond had been formed regardless.{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 9}}

Rambeau became close friends with Carol Danvers, the current Captain Marvel, casually visiting her from time to time to hang out.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 8}}{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 27}} When [[Vox Supreme (Earth-616)|Vox Supreme]], one of Danvers' nemeses, started capturing and brainwashing previous holders of the Captain Marvel, Spectrum was among the many "Marvels" who were turned into his lackeys, being forced to battle her friend.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 10 33}}

| Powers                  = '''Energy Form:''' Due to bombardment by extra-dimensional energies, Monica Rambeau acquired the ability to change herself into any form of energy within the electromagnetic spectrum.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 16}} Among the many energy forms, she has assumed and is able to control are visible light, radio waves, electricity, X-rays,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 16}}, microwaves,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 227}} infrared radiaton{{r|Avengers Vol 1 231}}, ultraviolet radiaton{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 6}}, cosmic rays, gamma radiation{{r|Avengers Vol 1 233}}{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 9}}, and a wide variety of high-power lasers.{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 6}} It has been theorized that this transformation occurs by Rambeau mentally shunting the matter of her body into the dimension from which she draws her energy, and replacing it with a corresponding amount of energy.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 1 143}} Rambeau is apparently unlimited by the amount of time that she can remain in her energy form.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 255}} In the past, she could seemingly only transform her entire body into one wavelength of energy at a time, being able to transform between one energy-state and another in a fraction of a second.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 227}} However, with experience, she has demonstrated the ability of converting only parts of herself into sentient energy.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 7}} Many derivative abilities are achieved in Rambeau's energy form.
* '''Flight:''' In her energy form, Rambeau is capable of flight in any of her wavelengths.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 16}} With experience, she has shown the ability to flight in her human solid form as well.{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 2}}{{r|Marvel Divas Vol 1 1}}
* '''Superhuman Speed:''' Rambeau is capable of moving at extremely high speeds while in her energy form. When converted into a beam of light, she is able to travel at lightspeed.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 227}}
* '''Intangibility:''' In certain energy forms such as X-rays, Rambeau can phase through solid matter and even certain energy fields depending on their wavelengths.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 231}}
* '''Invisibility:''' When changed into wavelenghts that are invisible to the naked eye, Rambeau renders herself invisible.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 231}}
* '''Energy Blasts:''' Rambeau is able of releasing blasts of pure electromagnetic radiation without compromising her body mass integrity.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 16}}
* '''Energy Absorption:''' In her energy form, Rambeau is able of rechanneling energy and absorb it to her own form.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 16}}
* '''Appearance Alteration:''' With due practice, Rambeau eventually managed to use her facility over light to modulate her energy and create holograms.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 256}} She has also been able to modify her appearance as an hologram, and outwardly take the form of other people. However, when she does so, she does not actually change her physical shape nor can she emulate their biometrics.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 5}}
* '''Hard Light Form:''' After recovering her powers, Rambeau has shown the ability to turn herself into a solid light form, allowing her to stay in energy form but physically interact with matter if she wishes so.{{r|Avengers: Unplugged Vol 1 5}}
* '''Size Alteration:''' Using her facility over light, Rambeau is able to change size. She has been shown both to be capable of shrinking{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 25}} and growing significantly in size if needed.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 7}}
* '''Energy Source:''' Having the ability to become a being of energy, Rambeau has been able to join her force with other super-human beings' energy signatures in order to empower their attacks as a live battery. In the past, she used her powers to boost Thor's Mjolnir,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 293}} the Wrecking Crew,{{r|Avengers Vol 3 18}} Carol Danvers,{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 8}} and She-Hulk.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 9}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Powers
| body  = '''Dimensional Interface Forcefield:''' After recovering from an accident that caused her to lose a big portion of her body mass due to her powers,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 294}} Rambeau's abilities changed drastically. No longer able to convert herself into energy, she acquired the ability to consciously envelope her body into a milimiter-thick dimensional interface that acted as a link between her physical body and the extradimensional source of her former powers. This force field was reactive to mechanical energy directed towards Rambeau, granting her extreme resistance against physical impact, increased strength and the ability to fly at high speeds.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 2 1|2}} However, her powers unexplainably returned to their former behaviour.{{r|Avengers: Unplugged Vol 1 5}}
'''Constant Energy Form:''' After being infused with additional photons by Blue Marvel's antimatter projection abilities, Rambeau experienced an extreme power boost.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 3}} The improvement turned Rambeau's energy form into her natural state, granting her not only higher limits to her previous abilities but also new ones.{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 1}} After burning out most of her additional power helping the Vision enter the House of Ideas in order to defeat Nyx,{{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 9}} Rambeau returned to being human again.{{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 10}}
* '''Hyper-Cosmic Awareness''': Although Rambeau took on a hard light semblance to resemble her human form, she did not process sensory reception like a regular human being. Her consciousness perpetuated approximate human senses allowing her to precisely be aware of what she was seeing, hearing or feeling and translating it to something her physiology recognized. To this extent she is also aware when something is grievously wrong with the universe as well, having prophetic dreams of a cage around Eternity.{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 1}}
* '''Eidetic Memory:''' Though since she acquired her powers, Rambeau's photographic memory improved, her power-up allowed to have total recall of everything she sees,{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 5}} probably an effect of a latent cosmic awareness that she had due to being an energy consciousness.{{r|Ultimates 2 Vol 2 1}}
* '''Immortality:''' Being a creature of pure energy, Rambeau used to be functionally immortal, not aging beyond her prime.{{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 1}}

| Strength                = Normal human female with moderate regular exercise.
| Weaknesses              = In her energy form, Monica Rambeau has shown to have some weaknesses and limitations:
* After acquiring her powers, Rambeau was unable of interacting with the physical world in her energy form, being restricted from becoming tangible.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 279}} Apparently, after mastering the ability to become solid light, this limitation stopped being a problem.{{r|Avengers: Unplugged Vol 1 5}}
* When converting herself into lightning and hitting the ocean, Captain Marvel proved to be unable to keep her cohesion and was severely damaged by the experience.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 293|294}} Following this episode, Rambeau has expressed her trauma of using her powers underwater.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 7 7}}
* Her energy form has been shown to be particularly vulnerable and inneficient against [[Darkforce|darkforce]] in several occasions.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 237}}{{r|Avengers Vol 1 268}}{{r|Avengers Vol 1 274}}

| Equipment               = 
| Transportation          = Rambeau is frequently seen captaining different ships, especially boats. When travelling for long distances, she usually relies on her super-speed powers; formerly [[Shockwave Rider]], [[Avengers Quinjet]], and various harbor patrol vehicles.
| Weapons                 = 

| Notes                   = * With the publication of [[Nextwave|''Nextwave'']], writer [[Warren Ellis]] presented a psychological depiction of Monica Rambeau that contradicted her previous representations. Rambeau was portrayed as a ruthless, cynical and angry operative as opposed to her more tender attitude from her period as an Avenger. This put the canonicity of the events that took place in ''Nextwave'' as part of the 616-reality continuity into question.{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 1|12}} Her adventures with Nextwave were eventually confirmed to have been factual and the uncertainty of their occurrence as well as her personality change were explained to be the result of Beyond©'s machinations.{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers Vol 1 6}} Following the ''Nextwave'' series, most representations of Rambeau are somewhat an amalgamation of her classic more serious nature and Ellis' satirical interpretation.
* After her accident in the open ocean, followed by a period of being powerless, Captain Marvel had her powers drastically changed upon their natural return. Unable to convert her mass into energy any longer, she became able redirect mechanical energy to another dimension, which in practice granted her abilities such as flight and super-human strength and durability.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 2 1}} Unexplainably, the new power set was soon dropped and ignored.{{r|Avengers: Unplugged Vol 1 5}} 

| Trivia                  = * Monica Rambeau's creator, [[Roger Stern]], gradually gave prominence to the character in his long-term run in the [[Avengers Vol 1|''Avengers'']] series, ultimately making her the leader of the team. Such a decision conflicted with editor [[Mark Gruenwald]]'s plans of characterizing Captain America as the competent leader of the group. Gruenwald planned to portray Captain America as a more efficient leader than Captain Marvel, a decision that Stern refused to perform, leading him to abandon the ''Avengers'' book  in issue [[Avengers Vol 1 387|#387]]. Subsequent writers followed Gruenwald's suggestions and Captain Marvel was depicted as an unexperienced and limited leader. The character was eventually written off of the book in issue [[Avengers Vol 1 394|#394]].<ref>[https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-11/3/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #11!]</ref> Tragically, the original allegory for the character explored how a black woman found herself unable to level her rank up as a Harbor Patrol Officer despite of her competence, but met recognition and equity with the Avengers. However, in the end, she turned out to be underestimated in the Avengers as well.
* Rambeau has changed her codename twice because of [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Genis-Vell]], the son of the original Captain Marvel. Accepting that Genis-Vell had rights over his father's legacy, Rambeau adopted the name Photon.{{r|Avengers: Unplugged Vol 1 5}} After Genis-Vell began going by Photon, Rambeau contemplated to call herself Pulsar.{{r|New Thunderbolts Vol 1 9}}
* A photon ([ˈfoʊ.tɑːn] FOH-ton) is an elementary particle corresponding to a quantum of light or any other type electromagnetic radiation. The codename was chosen by Rambeau for being considered as well-suited to correspond to her abilities.{{r|Avengers: Unplugged Vol 1 5}} The name was mocked once by Aaron Stack, who defined it as an insignificant and undetectable particle.{{r|Nextwave Vol 1 1}}
* Pulsar ([ˈpʌl.sɑːɹ] PUHL-sahr) stands for "pulsating radio source" and designate compact stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation out of their magnetic poles.<ref>[[wikipedia:Pulsar]]</ref> Rambeau contemplated adopting Pulsar as her super-hero name,{{r|New Thunderbolts Vol 1 9}} although she has never been effectivelly referred to by it.
* The name spectrum ([ˈspek.tɹəm] SPEK-trəm) refers to the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e. the range of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.<ref>[[wikipedia:Electromagnetic spectrum]]</ref> The name, similarly to "photon", is a direct reference to Rambeau's power set.
* Spectrum was once considered to be an Alpha-Level Threat by [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America (Sam Wilson)]] and [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]].{{r|Captain America and the Mighty Avengers #1}}
