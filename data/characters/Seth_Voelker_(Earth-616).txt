| History                 = Seth Voelker was born in Kenosha, [[Wisconsin (State)|Wisconsin]]. As Sidewinder, he was originally hired by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon Oil Company]] to retrieve the [[Serpent Crown]], and outfitted with a cloak that had teleportation powers. Alongside [[Serpent Squad (Roxxon Oil) (Earth-616)|the third incarnation of the Serpent Squad]], Sidewinder was able to return the crown to company president [[Hugh Jones (Earth-616)|Hugh Jones]].{{r|Marvel Two-In-One Vol 1 66}} However, after that stint, he decided to form his own criminal organization, the [[Serpent Society (Earth-616)|Serpent Society]]. Given his ability to teleport, Sidewinder promised his recruits they would never be imprisoned. This attracted several snake-themed villains, and the Serpent Society was quite the success. He also started a romantic relationship with his teammate [[Tanya Sealy (Earth-616)|Black Mamba]].{{Citation}}

Later, Sidewinder was betrayed by his organization after [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]] infiltrated the group. After being poisoned, he was aided by [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]], who gave him the antidote, and the two escaped and survived. On being contacted by Black Mamba, Sidewinder repaid the favor when Diamondback was captured and sentenced to death by the Society and its new leader [[Klaus Voorhees (Earth-616)|King Cobra]], saving her from death by lethal injection. Sidewinder however refused to help Black Mamba and the [[Cleopatra_Nefertiti_(Earth-616)|Asp]] escape King Cobra's grasp, saying Black Mamba would not want to be in his debt.{{Citation}}

A [[Sidewinder (Robot) (Earth-616)|robotic Sidewinder]] later appeared and was employed by King Cobra.{{Citation}}

Most recently, Sidewinder was seen in an interview and has since retired from villainy.{{r|New Thunderbolts #7}}
