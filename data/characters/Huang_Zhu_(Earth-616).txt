| History                 = Huang Zhu was with the nationalists in [[China]] during it's civil war, after which he joined [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]. The Warlord committed genocide on the
Mnnzz' Guthir tribe, exterminating them all except for Princess [[Xantia]]. Taking their land, he established his base of operations in an ancient temple complex which had been built by the [[Eternals (Homo immortalis)|Eternals]]. In Hydra's opium fields were genetically-engineered "super-poppies". 

He organized a martial arts tournament, inviting martial artists from around the world to participate, in what they soon learned were death matches. On the night of the tournament, [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] attacked his operation. Xantia took advantage of the opportunity and killed the Warlord, meanwhile SHIELD burned the opium fields.{{r|Super Soldiers Vol 1 6|7}}
