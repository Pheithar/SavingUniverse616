For more information on the other identities of Nathaniel Richards, please refer to the entries on [[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|Iron Lad]], [[Nathaniel Richards (Kid Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Kid Immortus]], the [[Nathaniel Richards (Scarlet Centurion) (Earth-6311)|Scarlet Centurion]], [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Rama-Tut]], and [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]].

In addition, there are many alternate version of Kang in existence. For the sake of clarity, it is commonly accepted that each alternate Kang that has interacted with [[Earth-616]] is a direct divergence from the "Prime" Kang of [[Earth-6311]]. While differentiating between each of these divergent Kangs is difficult, all those that are tied in with the Kang-Prime are listed here for reasons that will become evident to the reader.

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) from Avengers Vol 1 269 001.jpg|thumb|left|Nathaniel Richards reinvents himself as Kang the Conqueror]]
===Origins===
Nathaniel Richards was born in the 30th century of [[Earth-6311]], a reality where humanity never went into the dark ages. After centuries of advancement and warfare, peace was brought to the land by a time-traveller from [[Earth-616]] named [[Nathaniel Richards (Earth-616)|Nathaniel Richards]]. Because Richards brought peace to this war-torn future, he was known as the legendary benefactor.{{r|Fantastic Four #273}} The Nathaniel Richards born to this reality is said to be a descendant of the Benefactor through [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]], although other records also indicate that he may also be a descendant of the [[Latveria]]n monarch known as [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Dr. Doom]].{{r|What If? Vol 2 39}} At the age of 16, intervention from his future self, as Kang the Conqueror, resulted in young Nathaniel to try and prevent his eventual transformation into Kang, briefly becoming the young hero known as [[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|Iron Lad]].{{r|Young Avengers #2}} The youth also briefly had a stint as a super-villain known as [[Nathaniel Richards (Kid Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Kid Immortus]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 2 8}} However Nathaniel Richards eventually returned to his native time to finally follow his proper destined path, possibly with his memories as Iron Lad erased, however at this time there is no conclusive explanation and the events leading to this are as yet unrecorded. As an adult, Nathaniel discovered a time machine and having grown bored of his peaceful time, traveled back in time to ancient Egypt on [[Earth-616]]. There he set himself up as a [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Pharaoh Rama-Tut]] until he was ousted from this position by the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|Fantastic Four #19}} Rama-Tut tried to flee back to his own era, but he was caught in a time storm and was forced to appear in the modern era of Earth-616. A chance encounter with his possible ancestor Dr. Doom,<ref>{{cl|Fantastic Four Annual #2}}{{cl|Captain America Annual #11}}. It is later revealed in {{cl|Avengers #269}} that the frequent time storms that thwarted Kang were created by his future self, [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]] as per {{cl|Avengers #269}} in part of a complex plan to curtail possible divergent realities created by Kang's time travels.</ref> inspired Nathaniel to abandon his Rama-Tut guise and assume one similar to Doom. In his first attempt, Nathaniel created the identity of the [[Nathaniel Richards (Scarlet Centurion) (Earth-6311)|Scarlet Centurion]], but abandoned this identity after being defeated by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Avengers Annual #2}}{{r|What If? Vol 2 29}}{{r|Captain America Annual #11}}

Resuming his Rama-Tut guise, Richards attempted once again to return to his native 30th Century. The time-storm caused him to overshoot his own era and he ended up in the war torn 40th Century. There Rama-Tut found a war torn future where barbarians battled with technology from past eras of which they had no knowledge of how they worked. Seeing his own personal knowledge on how these weapons operated, Rama-Tut found it simple to reinvent himself and conquer this era. Creating the identity of Kang the Conqueror, Richards began to do just that. First Kang conquered the Earth,{{r|Avengers #8}}{{r|Avengers #269}}{{r|Captain America Annual #11}} then began conquering the galaxy, taking over entire empires, including that of the [[Badoon]].{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} But even this was not enough and Nathaniel's mind continued to turn back to the modern age of heroes and sought to conquer it as well.{{r|Avengers #8}}{{r|Avengers #269}}{{r|Captain America Annual #11}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} One of his earliest observations of the past was when Kang briefly appeared over Times Square in New York City, circa 1939. This caused brief hysteria and some media coverage, but otherwise his appearance was dismissed as a hoax by the authorities of that time.{{r|1939 Daily Bugle #1}} It has been stated that part of Kang's motivations for wanting to conquer the modern age was due to incomplete historical records that spoke of a Celestial Madonna who would sire the most powerful man in history. Kang was determined to learn the identity of the Madonna and ensure that he was the father of that child.{{r|Avengers #129}}

===To Conquer the Modern Age===
When Kang appeared for the first time in the modern age of Earth-616, his ship landed outside of Washington D.C. Blasting a landing strip with his ship, Kang held off the United States Army with his advanced weapons and ordered that he would only speak with the leaders of the world. In response the United States government contacted the Avengers to deal with this unique crisis.{{r|Avengers #8}}{{r|Avengers #269}}{{r|Captain America Annual #11}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes #4}}{{r|Captain America: Man Out of Time #4}} When the Avengers arrived to face Kang, his first show of power showed him easily capable of fighting off Earth's Mightiest Heroes. After revealing his origins to them and another battle, Kang easily defeated his foes and took them prisoner.{{r|Avengers #8}}{{r|Avengers #269}}{{r|Captain America Annual #11}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes #4}}{{r|Captain America: Man Out of Time #4}} However while in the process of trying to imprison [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], the Star-Spangled Avenger broke free and battled Kang. Detecting that Rogers was from the 1940s, Kang arbitrarily decided that he did not belong and sent Cap hurtling back in time to the year 1945.<ref>{{cl|Captain America: Man Out of Time #4}}. As revealed in {{cl|Avengers #4}}, [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] ended up in suspended animation during [[World War II]] and at the time was just recently revived in the modern era.</ref> The only members not captured were the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] and Captain America's sidekick [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]]. The two then began to plot how to free their comrades.{{r|Avengers #8}} With the help of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]] of the Fantastic Four, they managed to rescue Captain America from 1945{{r|Captain America: Man Out of Time #5}} then rallied Rick's [[Teen Brigade (Earth-616)|Teen Brigade]]. The group pretended to want to side with Kang, completely fooling the conqueror who allowed them aboard his ship.{{r|Avengers #8}} Rick,{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes #4}} Teen Brigade,{{r|Avengers #8}} and Captain America{{r|Captain America: Man Out of Time #5}} all worked together to free the captured Avengers.{{r|Avengers #8}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes #4}}{{r|Captain America: Man Out of Time #5}} The Avengers then confronted Kang and battled him anew, severely damaging his armor.{{r|Avengers #8}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes #4}}{{r|Captain America: Man Out of Time #5}} Kang then attempted to launch a Neutrino Missile, but this weapon was destroyed by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]].{{r|Avengers #8}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes #4}} Kang then attempted to expose the Avengers to lethal rays of radiation, but this was focused back on him by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]],{{r|Avengers #8}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes #4}} forcing Kang to flee back to his own era.{{r|Avengers #8}}{{r|Avengers #269}}{{r|Captain America Annual #11}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}}{{r|Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes #4}}{{r|Captain America: Man Out of Time #5}} Kang has also stated that during this encounter he placed a time probe to monitor for the appearance of the Celestial Madonna.{{r|Avengers #129}} Unforeseen by Kang at this time, each of his travels into the past created divergent versions of himself, all of which ruled their own divergent empires and continued their own schemes.{{r|Avengers #267}} One particular Kang referred to himself as the "Prime" Kang, although he has admitted that he cannot be certain for sure.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}}

[[File:Kang posing as Victor Timely circa 1901 from Avengers Annual Vol 1 21.jpg|thumb|138px|Kang posing as Victor Timely]]
Following this humiliating defeat, a divergent version of Kang{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} decided to set up a beachhead in the 20th Century from which he could begin planning his conquest of the modern age. He traveled back in time to January 1, 1901 where he established the town of Timely, [[Wisconsin (State)|Wisconsin]] under the guise of Victor Timely and became the town's mayor. He also established factories and a business, Timely Industries. Teaching his staff the basic principles of robotics. Kang also established the realm of [[Chronopolis]] which originally started as a fortress out of synch with time in the exact area of Timely, but it eventually grew and branched off to become a massive crossroads between Earth's past, present, and future.{{r|Avengers Annual #21}} Kang used Chronopolis to monitor his conquests and when he was away from Timely, he had robotic stand-ins that would seemingly age and eventually "Victor Timely" died. He was replaced with "Victor Timely Jr."

[[File:Kang posing as Victor Timely circa 1929 in Avengers Annual Vol 1 21.jpg|thumb|left|Victor Timely Jr. circa 1929]]
In 1929, Kang while posing as Timely Jr, employed [[Phineas Horton (Earth-616)|Phineas Horton]], and through this employment Horton eventually developed the technology that brought the original [[Human Torch (Android) (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] android to live in 1939. By the 1980s, and using the guise of Victor Timely III, Kang had made Timely Industries a successful technology manufacturer. Timely technology indirectly were responsible for much of the later advancements and some of this technology eventually went into the equipment used by Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic Four, the cybernetic arm of detective [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] and the design for [[Roxxon Oil|Roxxon Oil]]'s [[Michael Collins (Earth-616)|Deathlok]] cyborg among others.{{r|Avengers Annual #21}}

[[File:Kang posing as Victor Timely III circa 1980 from Avengers Annual Vol 1 21.jpg|thumb|Victor Timely III circa 1980]]
During this time the "Prime" Kang continued to observe the Avengers, keeping track of their exploits and line-up changes.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} He also focused on his further conquest of the 40th century, waging war against the [[Shi'ar]] and the [[Skrulls]]. Through his monitoring of the Avengers he also learned of another time-traveler calling himself [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]], who unknown to Kang, was his future self.<ref>{{cl|Thor Annual #17}}. [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]] first openly clashed with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] in {{cl|Avengers #10}} although as the [[Avengers: Forever Vol 1|Avengers: Forever]] series revealed, he had been manipulating the group as early as {{cl|Avengers #2}}. Kang did not learn that Immortus was his future self until {{cl|Giant-Size Avengers #3}}</ref> When one divergent Kang returned his attentions to the Avengers again, he built an [[Spider-Man (Android) (Earth-6311)|android]] based on the novice hero [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and used it to try and lure the Avengers into a trap. However this plot was foiled thanks to the intervention of the real Spider-Man who defeated his robotic doppelganger.{{r|Avengers #11}}{{r|Thor Annual #17}} 

Another divergent version of Kang{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} decided to try and conquer the modern age of heroes by taking over a past century in the hopes of erasing his foes from existence. He began monitoring the 6th century, and when the heroic [[Percival of Scandia (Earth-616)|Black Knight]] was away battling his foe [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-616)|Morgan Le Fay]] he attacked the kingdom of [[Camelot]].{{r|Thor Annual #17}} He quickly incapacitated the wizard [[Maha Yogi (Earth-616)|Merlin]] and bested [[Arthur Pendragon (Earth-616)|King Arthur]] and his [[Knights of the Round Table (Earth-616)|Knights of the Round Table]]. He then took over the kingdom of Camelot and began using his advanced intelligence to help the knights construct sophisticated weapons for that era in the hopes of conquering the Earth. However Kang's attempt to take over the 6th century was witnessed by the [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Watcher]] who brought the Fantastic Four's [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] into the past to stop Kang. While the Thing battled Kang's forces, the Torch freed Merlin. When the wizard disabled Kang's power source, the two heroes easily defeated him, forcing Kang to flee back to his own time.<ref>{{cl|Strange Tales #134}}{{r|Thor Annual #17}} {{cl|Avengers Annual #22}} reveals that the Merlin that Kang fought here was the [[Maha Yogi (Earth-616)|Merlin impostor]] of [[Earth-616]] and not the true [[Merlyn (Otherworld)|Merlin]] of [[Otherworld]].</ref> The true Kang still continued to monitor the Avengers, witnessing their first line-up change which included Captain America, [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], and [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]].{{r|Avengers #16}} He was later possibly the Kang that was manipulated by his possible ancestor, Dr. Doom, who used his emotion-changer device to gather an army of super-villains to attack the wedding of Mr. Fantastic and the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Girl]].{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #3}} Kang was involved in a massive battle between the gathered super-villains and the heroes who were attending the wedding.{{r|Marvel: Heroes & Legends #1}} The battle came to an abrupt end when the Watcher provided Reed Richards with a time displacer which he used to send the villains back to where they came from, with all memory of their attack erased,{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #3}}{{r|Thor Annual #17}}{{r|Marvel: Heroes & Legends #1}} however through reviewing recordings of his exploits Kang eventually remembered this battle.{{r|Thor Annual #17}}

Kang briefly returned to the 40th century to continue his conquests of worlds there.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} He later discovered the dimension of [[Kosmos (Dimension)|Kosmos]] and its size-changing properties that are tied to [[Pym Particles]]. He conquered this dimension and enslaved its native [[Kosmosians]] forcing them to assist in the creation of his [[Growing Man (Earth-6311)|Growing Men]] constructs.{{r|Thunderbolts #13}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} Once the Kosmosians completed their task, Kang hid the Growing Men in various eras to hide these potent weapons from his enemies.{{r|Thor #140}} 

[[File:Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-6311) and Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) from Avengers Vol 1 24 001.jpg|thumb|left|Ravonna sacrifices her life for Kang]]
===Princess Ravonna===
In his native 40th Century, the true Kang had fallen in loved with [[Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-6311)|Princess Ravonna Renslayer]] a princess of an Earthly kingdom. Due to his love for Ravonna, Kang allowed [[Carelius (Earth-6311)|her father]] to remain in rule of his kingdom but pressured Ravonna to marry him in order for her father to continue to maintain his autonomy from Kang's empire. Ravonna refused his hand in marriage and Kang sought to prove his power to her by transporting the Avengers Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and the Scarlet Witch to his era and defeating them in battle. Later when Captain America learned that his fellow Avengers were kidnapped, he issued a challenge to his foe and was brought to the future and defeated him as well. These defeats did nothing to impress Ravonna, and Kang ordered his forces to attack, just as the Avengers recovered to defend the kingdom.{{r|Avengers #23}}{{r|Thor Annual #17}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} Kang and his army easily overtook the small kingdom and the Avengers were once more defeated and taken prisoner. However, when Kang decided to spare Ravonna and her father, this earned the ire of his commanders who saw this mercy as weakness. Chief among these was his the commander known as [[Baltag (Earth-6311)|Baltag]] who sought to usurp command of Kang's armies. With his forces turned against him, Kang realized that his love for Ravonna was greater than conquering this kingdom and he grudgingly realized that only the Avengers could help him fight off Baltag and his forces. The Avengers proved to be a great help defeated the army, it's commanders taken prisoner. Seeing Kang show compassion and caring, Ravonna decided to accept his romantic advances. Just as Kang was returning the Avengers to their own time, Baltag broke free and tried to shoot Kang in the back. Ravonna saw this and threw herself in the path of the weapon's beam and was struck down. Baltag was then executed. Ravonna seemingly died in Kang's arm, suggesting that perhaps their love was never meant to be.{{r|Avengers #24}}{{r|Thor Annual #17}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} However, Kang refused to let his love perish and used 40th century science to keep her in a state of suspended animation, not dead but not alive either.{{r|Avengers #69}}{{r|Thor Annual #17}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} Many of the alternate versions of Kang also experienced similar tragedies.{{r|Avengers #267}}

The true Kang decided to put aside his pain and seek out even greater adventure, in his native time he clashed once again with the Shi'ar, forcing them to surrender. This did little to fill the void in his life and Kang soon desired to restore Ravonna to life.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} However finding a means to do so did not occur directly as one of his Growing Men was unearthed in the modern age of Earth-616. Returning there to retrieve it, Kang engaged in another battle with Thor. Recovering his Growing Man, Kang then attempted to flee in his time machine, but Thor used his hammer [[Mjolnir]] to capture it in an infinity vortex, seemingly destroying Kang in the process.{{r|Thor #140}}{{r|Thor Annual #17}} In reality, another divergence was created with one Kang ending up in the timeless realm of [[Limbo (Temporal)|Limbo]]{{r|Avengers #269}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} while another ended up back in his native 40th century of Earth-6311.{{r|Thor Annual #17}} The Kang that ended up in Limbo found the citadel of Immortus. Unaware that was a future version of himself, Kang began using his equipment to study history. Coming across the moment when Ravonna was about to sacrifice her life for him, Kang activated a device that pluck [[Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-8657)|Ravonna]] out of the time-stream, creating a [[Earth-8657|divergent reality]] in which [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-8657)|Kang]] was slain in her stead, an incident that horrified Kang.<ref>{{cl|Avengers #269}}{{cl|Avengers: Forever #9}}. This was revealed to be another manipulation by [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]] to try and rein in Kang, eliminate all his divergences and ensure that Immortus was the final fate of Nathaniel Richards as revealed in {{cl|Avengers #269}}</ref>

===Game of the Galaxies===
The divergent Kang who ended up back in the 41st century of Earth-6311 crushed a small rebellion{{r|Thor Annual #17}} before he continued to find a means to revive Ravonna. After many fruitless attempts to restore her, the [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elder of the Universe]] known as the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] appeared before him. The Grandmaster offered Kang a challenge: To pit champions of his choice against those of the Grandmaster's own making. If Kang's champions won, he would be given the power over life and death. If Kang lost, the Grandmaster would then obliterate the Earth. Kang agreed to the terms and was given a year to gather his chosen champions.{{r|Avengers #69}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} Kang chose his old foes the Avengers to represent him. After plucking the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] from his homeland of [[Wakanda]], Kang then sent one of his Growing Men to New York City. There his creation kidnapped [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] from a hospital where he was recovering from a heart attack to lure the Avengers into a beam that brought them to the future. The Avengers agreed to battle for Kang on the condition that Stark was returned to the present to seek medical treatment. Captain America, [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Goliath]], and Thor were then transported to modern day Earth where they were to battle the Grandmaster's created minions the [[Squadron Sinister (Earth-616)|Squadron Sinister]].<ref>{{cl|Avengers #69}}. [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] suffered a heart attack battling an [[Life-Model Decoys|Iron Man Life-Model Decoy]] in {{cl|Iron Man #18}} and was rushed to the hospital in {{cl|Avengers #69}}. At the time, Iron Man's true identity was a secret even to his fellow [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. Stark underwent surgery and recovered in {{cl|Iron Man #19}}</ref>{{r|Thor Annual #17}} The trio were joined by Iron Man, and they went to four different locations to stop each Squadron member from stealing a national landmark, while Kang and the Grandmaster observed events from the future. 

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) and Avengers (Earth-616) from Avengers 1 71 001.jpg|thumb|292px|Kang harnesses the power of death over the Avengers]]
In New York City, Captain America prevented [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]] from stealing the Statue of Liberty. Iron Man stopped [[Kinji Obatu (Earth-616)|Dr. Spectrum]] from absconding with the Taj Mahal in India. In Egypt, Thor stopped [[Hyperion (Grandmaster's Creation) (Earth-616)|Hyperion]] from taking the Sphinx. Goliath traveled to London where he attempted to stop the [[James Sanders (Earth-616)|Whizzer]] from stealing Big Ben. However interference from the heroic [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]] caused the Grandmaster to call the battle a forfeit and transported Goliath and Whizzer back to the future, inadvertently transporting the Knight's [[Ebony Blade]] as well.{{r|Avengers #70}}{{r|Thor Annual #17}} With the first round in forfeit, Kang agreed to another match between the Grandmaster. This time they sent the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]] and the Black Panther to France circa 1941 to battle the original [[Invaders (Earth-616)|Invaders]]: Captain America, the [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]] and the original Human Torch. While this battle raged, the Black Knight used his mystical connection to the Ebony Blade to transport himself to the future and free the other Avengers who were being held in stasis. When the Avengers sent to 1941 succeeded in defeating their contemporaries they were brought back to the present just as their contained comrades confronted Kang. Although Kang was technically the victor, his 'draw' in the first round meant that the Grandmaster would only give him the power of life ''or'' death. Unwilling to let go of his hatred over the Avengers, Kang chose the power to kill the Avengers rather than the power to save Ravonna. However, he was felled by the Black Knight who at the time was not a member of the Avengers, and thus immune to his powers. With his defeat, Kang lost his powers over death and the Grandmaster sent the Avengers home before departing himself, leaving Kang along to regret the choice that he had made.{{r|Avengers #71}}{{r|Thor Annual #17}}

Records of which Kang engaged in what activities are hard to determine beyond this point, however it has been confirmed that the Prime Kang was still monitoring events in Limbo.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} One version of Kang found a means of prolonging his life by developing a device that would transfer his mind into a cloned body in his native timeline upon death.<ref>This was hinted at in {{cl|Fantastic Four Annual #25}}, inferred in {{cl|Avengers Annual #21}} and clarified more thoroughly in {{cl|Avengers: Forever #9}}.</ref> Determined that the best way to conquer the modern age was to start by affecting history in the 19th Century during [[World War I]]. Through his observations he learned that the fighter ace known as the [[Karl Kaufman (Earth-616)|Phantom Eagle]] was destined to destroy a German mortar cannon that would have changed the face of the war. If prevented from doing so, a French ancestor of [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] -- the man destined to become the Hulk, and a founding member of the Avengers -- would be killed. This Kang theorized that with the death of this ancestor the Avengers would never come to be. However when Kang attempted to travel to the year 1917 he was prevented from breaching that time period thanks to a time storm. Instead Kang decided to trick the Hulk, believing his near limitless strength could breach the barrier. Appealing to the Hulk's hatred of his alter-ego, Kang successfully sent the Hulk into the past. However, the Hulk inadvertently destroyed the cannon while trying to stop the Phantom Eagle. The time storm then began a sling shot effect, which Kang fought against but ultimately lost. While the Hulk was hurtled to his proper time, Kang himself was thrown into time and was seemingly lost in the time stream.{{r|Incredible Hulk #135}}{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} This Kang cheated this fate by transferring his mind to a new body.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}}

One Kang went on to find another beachhead from which to launch his attacks on the modern age, deciding to set up operations in the 23rd century of [[Earth-6297]], due to the fact that possible future abolished all weapons and was powerless to stop his invasion. This earned the ire of that of a rival time traveler and would be conqueror, [[Artur Zarrko (Earth-6297)|Zarrko the Tomorrow Man]]. Kang then used this front to capture the Avengers and imprison them in this future. With a time storm stopping him from breaching Kang's citadel, Zarrko recruited the modern day heroes Iron Man and Spider-Man, bringing them to the 23rd century knowing their presence would weaken the time storm. When the two heroes confronted Kang, Zarrko betrayed them and got the drop on Kang.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #9}}{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}} Zarrko then decided to use Kang's own plan to conquer the modern age using Kang's "Time Bombs", devices that would revert the people and technology of the era back to a more primitive time. While Zarrko and Kang were busy in a stand-off, Spider-Man revived and escaped back to his own era in a time machine. There he recruited the help of the Fantastic Four's Human Torch to locate and deactivate the Time Bombs.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #10}} Learning from the Torch that the FF's allies the [[Inhumans]] could assist him in using the last functional Time Bomb to return to the future, arriving just moments before Spider-Man originally left, Spidey and the Inhumans managed to get the drop on Zarrko and Kang. While [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] freed the Avengers, Spider-Man rounded up Zarrko, but Kang managed to escape in the chaos leaving behind an empty suit of armor.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #11}}{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}}

===Celestial Madonna===
Soon, one divergent Kang became aware that the [[Celestial Madonna]] was reaching her developmental protection as a new dawn star began shining in the sky of the modern age, suspended over [[Avengers Mansion]]. Kang traveled back to the modern era to collect the Celestial Madonna determining that it must be one of three women who were in residence at the mansion: the Scarlet Witch, the enigmatic [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]] or the elderly sorceress [[Agatha Harkness (Earth-616)|Agatha Harkness]].{{r|Avengers #128}} Kang unleashed his Macrobots upon the Avengers who were easily overpowered. Kang then took the three women as well as Thor, Iron Man, and the Vision prisoner. Kang then left the [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]] behind, considering him the weakest of the Avengers and thus beneath his notice. Kang and his prisoner relocated to a secret lab hidden within an Egyptian pyramid built in Kang's honor during his days as Rama-Tut. There he plotted to begin World War III by encasing each of the male Avengers in one of his Macrobots and sending them to assassinate key political figures in the United States, China, and Russia in order to spark nuclear Armageddon. In breaching the pyramid, thanks to the mystical guidance of Agatha Harkness, the Swordsman awoke the ancient vampire [[Amenhotep (Vampire) (Earth-616)|Amenhotep]] as well as the slumbering form of Rama-Tut who had been in suspended animation for over 5000 years in an attempt to stop his past self -- as Kang -- from continuing on his current path.<ref>{{cl|Avengers #129}}. The [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Rama-Tut]] seen here is not the younger version of Kang who battled the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] in {{cl|Fantastic Four #19}}, but a future version of Kang himself as revealed in {{cl|Giant-Size Avengers #2}}</ref>{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}}

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) and Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311) from Giant-Size Avengers Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|322px|left|Rama-Tut vs Kang the Conqueror]]
The future Rama-Tut prevented the Swordsman from slaying Kang{{r|Avengers #129}} and brought him back to New York where they recruited Hawkeye, who at the time was not an active member of the Avengers.<ref>{{cl|Giant-Size Avengers #2}}. [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] quit the Avengers at the time in {{cl|Avengers #109}}</ref> The trio stopped the Macrobot using the Vision to slay the United States Secretary of State at the UN Building in New York. They then traveled to China where they stopped the Macrobot leeching Iron Man's powers to try and eliminate the Chinese government's ruling class. Furious at this inference, Kang scrapped his plan to assassinate a Russian politician and unleashed the Thor powered Macrobot on the heroes which was also defeated. During the conflict the Avengers freed all the comrades, including the three captive females. Also during the fight, Kang revealed the true identity of Rama-Tut and learned that he is his future self. With the same man from different eras face to face, time ruptured revealing to all gathered that Mantis was destined to be the Celestial Madonna. With his plans being thwarted at every step, Kang decided that if he could not have the Celestial Madonna nobody could and tried to shoot Mantis. Despite interference from Rama-Tut, the shot was true, but before it could strike Mantis the Swordsman stepped in its path sacrificing his life for hers. Meanwhile Kang and Rama-Tut's scuffle sent them crashing into the controls of Kang's time-sphere and both men were lost in the time stream.{{r|Giant-Size Avengers #2}}{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}} Both men were plucked out of the time stream and transported to Limbo by Immortus, and Immortus pretended to ally himself with Kang by imprisoning Rama-Tut. Immortus then gave Kang access to his devices to get revenge against the Avengers. Kang used this to gather various super-humans just moments from their deaths to form his [[Legion of the Unliving (Kang) (Earth-616)|Legion of the Unliving]]. These minions included the [[Frankenstein's Monster (Earth-616)|Frankenstein's Monster]], [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]], the original Human Torch, [[M'Nai (Earth-616)|Midnight]], the [[Joost van Straaten (Earth-616)|Ghost]], and [[Heinrich Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]]. He then transported the Avengers to Limbo to battle his minions.<ref>{{cl|Avengers #131}}. It was later revealed in {{cl|Avengers: Forever #8}} that this was all part of a plot by [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]] to have the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] learn the connection between the original [[Human Torch (Android) (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] to further manipulate their destinies as he saw fit. All the characters were plucked from just moments from their apparent deaths. [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] was pulled from {{cl|Avengers #9}}, however it was later revealed in {{cl|Avengers #152}} that he was merely in a state of suspended animation. The Human Torch was not technically dead, but rather deactivated circa 1955 as revealed in {{cl|Fantastic Four Annual #4}}. The Torch's life and resurrections are quite complicated but are explained in {{cl|Avengers: Forever #8}}. The [[Joost van Straaten (Earth-616)|Ghost]] was slain in {{cl|Silver Surfer #9}}. [[M'Nai (Earth-616)|Midnight]] was slain in {{cl|Special Marvel Edition #16}} at the hands of [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]] however he was later resurrected in {{cl|Silver Surfer Vol 3 29}}. [[Heinrich Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] was slain battling [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] in {{cl|Avengers #15}}. The [[Frankenstein's Monster (Earth-616)|Frankenstein Monster]] was technically not dead, but was snatched from time during the events of {{cl|Frankenstein #12}}</ref>{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}}

Kang led his Legion into the vast labyrinth of Limbo to slay the Avengers and reclaim Mantis. However his control over the Legion began to weaken the longer they were active in Limbo, the first to break free from his control being the Frankenstein's Monster. The Legion managed to slay Iron Man and seriously damage the Vision in their hunt for the heroes.{{r|Avengers #132}} During the battle, Kang sent Baron Zemo back to make sure that Rama-Tut and Immortus did not escape. Meanwhile, his control on the Human Torch failed and with the help of the Frankenstein's Monster he managed to partially repair the Vision. Midnight on the other hand faced Mantis and was defeated. Wonder Man later fell battling Thor who then turned his vengeance on Kang for the death of Iron Man. Unable to withstand the blows of Thor's hammer, Kang once more fled into the time stream. Zemo was later defeated by Hawkeye who then freed Immortus and Rama-Tut. Immortus then brought Iron Man back to life, repair the Vision and sent the members of the Legion to face their destinies. Immortus then convinced Rama-Tut to return to his own destiny as well before revealing to the Avengers that he himself was a future version of Kang before sending the Avengers home.{{r|Giant-Size Avengers #3}}{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}} It was later revealed to the Avengers that Mantis was to form a union with a member of the plantlike [[Cotati]] race who had taken on the form of her deceased lover the Swordsman and Immortus offered to officiate their wedding<ref>Revealed in {{cl|Avengers #134}} & {{cl|Avengers #135|135}}. This also was part of his complex plot to manipulate the destiny of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] as seen in {{cl|Avengers: Forever #8}}</ref> When the wedding was being planned in Vietnam, Kang reappeared in the present to make one more attack on the Avengers to try and capture Mantis. To this end he appeared in that era at three different moments, making three Kangs present. After taking down the communist heroes known as the [[Titanic Three (Earth-616)|Titanic Three]], the three Kangs distracted Thor, Iron Man and Hawkeye who managed to capture all the duplicates. However the "real" Kang then kidnapped who he thought was Mantis and escaped into space. However, Immortus already knew what Kang was planning, and had his minion the [[Space Phantom (Temporal Limbo)|Space Phantom]] take the form of Mantis, storing the real Celestial Madonna safely in Limbo. By the time the Space Phantom revealed his true form, it was too late for Kang, as Immortus succeeded in marrying Mantis and the Cotati and they transformed into pure energy and left to meet their destiny in the stars.{{r|Giant-Size Avengers #4}}

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) from Avengers Forever Vol 1 6 001.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Kang attempts to conquer the 19th Century]]
===The American Frontier===
This Kang decided to once more attempt to alter the course of the modern age by conquering an earlier era, this time targeting the 19th century. However while travelling through the time stream, he was confronted by Hawkeye who was using Dr. Doom's time-platform to try and reach the 12th century. The two battled it out, but ended up throwing themselves into the same era, only some time apart.{{r|Avengers #142}} Appearing in the year 1873, Kang built an inn and saloon in the town of Tombstone, Arizona, convincing the locals that his mask was to cover a wound sustained in the American Civil War. He then used a device to sap the will of the locals and used them as slaves to build a massive citadel within the inn. Unaffected by this was the western hero known as the [[Matthew Hawk (Earth-616)|Two-Gun Kid]] who found happenings suspicious. He called out on other heroes of the west to help him investigate. The first to answer his call were the [[Jonathan Clay (Earth-616)|Rawhide Kid]] and [[Blaine Colt (Earth-616)|Kid Colt]]. When they went to confront Kang, he revealed his true nature to them, unleashing a dinosaur summoned from the prehistoric past to drive them away.{{r|Avengers: Forever #4}} While this was occurring three more time travelling Avengers --- Yellowjacket, Hawkeye, and [[Melissa Gold (Earth-98120)|Songbird]] --- arrived in that era mistaking the chronal anomalies occurring were part of their on going [[Destiny War]]. Kang detected their presence, and not knowing who they were or what their intentions were took away the time-sphere given to them by Kang's future self before trying to kill them in a cave in.<ref>{{cl|Avengers: Forever #5}}. The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] who appeared here are from different points in history and were gathered by [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] in {{cl|Avengers: Forever #1}} to stop [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]] and his masters the [[Time-Keepers]] from eliminating various alternate realities. This also put them in an uneasy alliance with a Kang from a number of decades in his personal future from this moment. For clarity it should be pointed out that [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]] was taken circa {{cl|Avengers #59}}, [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] was plucked from {{cl|Avengers #99}}, a Hawkeye from the past prior to the encounter with Kang listed directly above that occurred in {{cl|Avengers #142}}. [[Melissa Gold (Earth-98120)|Songbird]] comes from a possible future on [[Earth-98120]] where she joined the Avengers. Both Yellowjacket and Hawkeye will not remember any of these events following the climax of [[Avengers: Forever Vol 1|Avengers: Forever]] as their memories faded as revealed in {{cl|Avengers: Forever #12}}. Thus neither character remembers this encounter after the fact. Also Kang does not recognize either Hawkeye or Yellowjacket despite having met them both previously. It should be assumed that Kang did not recognize them due to their disguises.</ref> Back in town, Two-Gun Kid was joined by the [[Ringo Kid (Earth-616)|Ringo Kid]] and the [[Carter Slade (Earth-616)|Night Rider]] and they attempted another attack on Kang. Kang took this moment to reveal his hidden citadel and then unleashed a biologically engineered lizard creature against the cowboys sending them fleeing. While Kang was distracted, the three time travelling Avengers managed to break into his citadel and escape in their recovered Time-Sphere.{{r|Avengers: Forever #6}}

Eventually the version of Hawkeye who battled Kang in the timestream appeared in 1873 and quickly allied himself with the Two-Gun Kid and his friends to battle against Kang.{{r|Avengers #142}} Learning that Hawkeye ran afoul of Kang in the timestream, his fellow Avengers Thor and [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]] were led to him by Immortus. They were confronted by Kang in the timestream but managed to fight him back.{{r|Avengers #141}} The duo were reunited with Hawkeye and they joined him and the cowboys in stopping outlaws hired by Kang from robbing a rail shipment of uranium.{{r|Avengers #142}} With Thor taking on his mortal guise of Donald Blake, he, Hawkeye, Moondragon, and the Two-Gun Kid infiltrated Kang's fortress. There Kang unleashed a massive mutated coyote to battle the heroes. Since Thor was in his mortal form, Kang did not recognize him and Blake was able to slip away and break into Kang's control room. There he changed back into Thor and the two fought it out. Kang was no match for the [[Asgardians|Asgardian]] thunder god's limitless strength and increased his force field too high causing it to seemingly disintegrate him. With Kang's seeming demise his fortress vanished. With Kang's seeming demise, Immortus led the Avengers to believe that he was erased from history as well,{{r|Avengers #143}} however this was revealed to be a ruse on Immortus' part.{{r|Avengers #269}} This version of Kang survived as well, using his mind transmitter to swap to a newly cloned body in the 40th century.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}}{{r|Avengers Annual #21}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #8}} This was witnessed by the "Prime" Kang who decided to develop a similar technology in order to cheat death himself.{{r|Avengers: Forever #8}}

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) from Avengers Vol 1 143 001.jpg|thumb|left|Kang disintegrating]]
By this time the Prime Kang had formed a [[Council of Kangs (Multiverse)|Council of Kangs]] in Limbo, consisting of himself, and two of his most cunning divergent selves. Seeing their alternates was insults to their legacy, they brought each alternate Kang to Limbo and executed them.{{r|Avengers #267}} One of the first recorded Kangs to be eliminated by the council was a [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-8386)|Kang]] who conquered the the 41st Century of [[Earth-8386]] where he forced the people to slay each other for his own amusement. Following his death, a massive statue was placed to continue manipulating the people of this world to kill themselves until it was destroyed by the Hulk of Earth-616.<ref>This world appears in {{cl|Incredible Hulk #286}}, however it was not revealed that [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-8386)|Kang-8386]] was slain by the [[Council of Kangs (Multiverse)|Council of Kangs]] until a profile for [[Hero of the Day (Earth-8386)|Hero of the Day]] in {{cl|World War Hulk: Gamma Files #1}}</ref>

===Secret Wars===
[[File:Ultron (Earth-616) and Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) from Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 4 001.jpg|thumb|113px|Kang slain by Ultron during the Secret Wars]]
Sometime later the Earth-616 universe was visited by the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] the powerful being sought to understand desire and summoned a group of heroes and villains. The heroes included the Avengers, three of the Fantastic Four, the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], the Hulk, and Spider-Man. The villains gathered were [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]], Dr. Doom, [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]], the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]], the [[Amora (Earth-616)|Enchantress]], [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Dr. Octopus]], the [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Lizard]], the [[Owen Reece (Earth-616)|Molecule Man]], the [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]], and one of the many divergent Kangs. The Beyonder then created [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]], a patchwork world comprised of chunks of various planets. He then told both sides to slay their enemies and all they desired would become theirs. Teleported planetside, Kang and the other villains set up operations in a high-tech facility. When Dr. Doom suggested that they rescind their petty desires to try and make contact with a seemingly all-powerful god, the other villains balked at this prompting Doom to bury them in debris and try to seek out the heroes. Unscathed by this attack, Kang watched as Doom flew away in an alien craft and blew it out of the sky. When the gathered heroes tried to assist Doom, he realized that they were unworthy of his plans as well and attack. He was soon joined by his fellow villains who were led by Kang while Doom fled.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #1}}{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}} During the ensuing battle the heroes captured Kang, the Enchantress as well as [[Eliot Franklin (Thunderball) (Earth-616)|Thunderball]], [[Brian Calusky (Earth-616)|Piledriver]] and [[Henry Camp (Earth-616)|Bulldozer]] of the Wrecking Crew and imprisoned them at their own headquarters. The other villains fled back to Dr. Doom who had reprogrammed Ultron to be his loyal bodyguard and executioner.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #2}}

Doom discovered that a suburb of Denver, Colorado was part of Battleworld{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #6}} and empowered two of its natives into [[Marsha Rosenberg (Earth-616)|Volcana]] and [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]] to bolster his ranks. He then launched an attack on the heroes headquarters, freeing Kang, and the Wrecking Crew. They were unable to rescue the Enchantress due to the fact that she was freed and ventured off with Thor earlier.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #3}}{{r|Thor #383}} After successfully launching an attack wherein an entire mountain was dropped on the heroes, Thor and the Enchantress returned teleporting before the gathered villains. Kang and his comrades then piled onto the thunder god and seemingly slew him.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #3}}{{r|Thor #383}} Seeking to avenge his previous betrayal and ensure loyalty, Dr. Doom later ordered Ultron to slay Kang, and the conqueror from the 40th century was atomized before his comrades.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #4}}{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}} Thor and the other heroes survived their apparent deaths and continued to clash with their foes until Dr. Doom managed to steal the power of the Beyonder.<ref>As seen in {{cl|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #4}} through {{cl|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #10|10}}</ref> With the power of the Beyonder, Doom sought to bring peace to the universe and to show his good faith to the heroes gathered he used his vast powers to resurrect Kang and return him to his proper place in time.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #11}} When recounting these events, Kang himself did not mention his resurrection, implying that he cheated death thanks to the device that transferred his mind to his new body.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}} There is no explanation for this omission. Ultimately, the heroes rebelled against Dr. Doom and with the help of the Beyonder defeated him. With the villains having escaped Battleworld, the Beyonder banished Dr. Doom and returned the heroes home.<ref>As seen in {{cl|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #11}} and {{cl|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #12|12}}</ref>

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) from Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars Vol 1 11 001.jpg|thumb|left|304px|Kang resurrected by Dr. Doom]]
Soon the Beyonder arrived on Earth and assumed human form to learn about human desire.{{r|Secret Wars II #1}} During his time on Earth, his existence became viewed as a threat to the natural order of the universe.{{r|Secret Wars II #6}} This prompted the demon [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] to create the Beyondersbane a device that utilized energies stolen from the Beyonder as well as that of [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]]. With the Beyondersbane only having a limited time before reaching critical mass, Mephisto devised a delivery of this powerful energy: an army of super-villains called the Legion Accursed. He sent out his agents to make offer various villains their hearts desire in exchange for destroying the Beyonder. All these villains had to do was touch the Beyonder to unleash the power that would theoretically destroy him. Kang was one of the many villains who agreed to the deal joining Mephisto's Legion Accursed. They attacked the Beyonder while he was meditating on a secluded island. However they ultimately failed thanks to the Thing who came to the Beyonder's defense, holding the villains at bay long enough for the Beyondersbane to hit critical mass. When the device self-destructed the pact Kang and the others made with Mephisto became null and void and they were all teleported back to their points of origins.{{r|Secret Wars II #7}} Eventually, an army of heroes battled the Beyonder to the end, a battle that ended in the Beyonder's seeming demise and ending his threat for a time.{{r|Secret Wars II #9}}

===[[Council of Kangs (Multiverse)|Council of Kangs]]===
[[File:Council of Kangs (Multiverse) from Avengers Vol 1 267 001.jpg|thumb|346px|The Council of Kangs (Multiverse)]]
By this time, the Prime Kang and his two counterparts succeeded in apparently eliminating every alternate version of Kang in existence, the last being their [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-267)|Earth-267]] counterpart. By this time the "Prime" Kang had been constructing robot duplicates of the eliminated Kangs to run their empires from remote and began plotting to eliminate his final two counterparts. He allowed [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-Unknown)|one of his two counterparts]] to infiltrate his secret sanctum where the Prime Kang then pretended to let him in on his secrets. Then after shocking the other Kang by revealing his still-living version of [[Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-8657)|Ravonna]], the Prime Kang shot him dead, as part of a plan to eliminate the Avengers and the [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-TRN281)|third Kang]]. To this end he transported the Wasp, [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], and the Black Knight to Limbo. He then sent out a robot to confront the Avengers challenging them to find his citadel and fight for a means to return home.{{r|Avengers #267}}

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) from Avengers Vol 1 267 001.jpg|thumb|left|The "Prime" Kang]]
When the heroes attempted to get information from the Space Phantom, Kang seemingly slew him before their eyes before unleashing a horde of [[Dire Wraiths]] upon them. While the Avengers were occupied the Prime Kang set up the dead body of the second Kang at a control console and contacted his third counterpart to trick him into returning to Limbo as they were under "attack" by the Avengers. Joined by Captain America, [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], and the Sub-Mariner, the Avengers reached Kang's citadel where they found the dead Kang. This coincided with the arrival of the third Kang who blamed the Avengers for murdering his counterpart and a fight broke out. When the third Kang realized that they had all been lured into a plot, the Prime Kang incapacitated them and imprisoned them in stasis beams. When they revived, the Prime Kang informed those gathered that he would eliminate them.{{r|Avengers #268}}

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) vs Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311) from Avengers Vol 1 269 001.jpg|thumb|Kang vs Immortus]]
The Prime Kang then revealed to his prisoners his own personal history and where he came to diverge from the other Kangs and his formation of the Council of Kangs (Multiverse) to eliminate his inferior duplicates. All the while he was talking, Hercules struggled against the stasis beam with his prestigious strength, causing it to overload. Noticing this, Ravonna remained quiet, not revealing this fact to Kang. Eventually the strain proved too much and the Avengers broke free. Ravonna revealed her betrayal and while she held the third Kang prisoner, the Avengers went after Kang-Prime. As the Prime Kang fled, the third Kang convinced Ravonna to let him go free to get revenge and she relented allowing him to leave. When the third Kang caught up with the Prime, he tried to shoot his counterpart with a concealed weapon unaware that Kang-Prime had booby-trapped it and it exploded in his face killing him instantly. The Prime Kang was the only one left he remained defiant in front of the Avengers until Immortus appeared with Ravonna by his side. Immortus revealed that through the career of each Kang, he was there manipulating things behind the scene to ensure that the path that leads Kang to becoming Immortus is the only path Kang would ever take. Immortus explained that he manipulated the Prime Kang directly, allowing him to enter Limbo, placing a fake body, and setting in motion the formation of the Council of Kangs. Immortus then showed off the fruits of his labor: the Psyche-Globe, which contained the memories of every slain counterpart of Kang. Seeking this knowledge for himself Kang struggled with Immortus and seized the Psyche-Globe from his hands. However when Kang tried to use the Psyche-Globe it bombarded his mind with all the memories all at once threatening to drive him mad, as Immortus had planned. Kang then fled into Limbo and when the Avengers tried to follow after him Immortus stopped them telling him that this was all ordained and sent the Avengers back to their proper place in time.{{r|Avengers #269}}{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} With his sanity quickly fleeting Kang triggered the time circuitry in his helmet creating two necessary divergent to divide the madness between. One returned to the 40th Century to recover,{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} while the other became [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-123488.23497)|Kang-123488.23497]].{{r|Avengers #293}}

===Council of Cross-Time Kangs===
By this time a group calling themselves the [[Council of Cross-Time Kangs (Multiverse)|Council of Cross-Time Kangs]] was organized. They consisted of various other beings and aliens that slew their own realities version of Kang and usurped his identity. There are conflicting explanations as to why they were formed. Kang-Prime has previously stated that he was responsible for their creation{{r|Avengers Annual #21}} while he has later considered them nothing more than pretenders and fools unworthy of his name.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} By their own explanations they are apparently a higher order that sat above various alternate Councils of Kang, each member being the sole survivor of a culling of their alternate selves across the [[Multiverse]].{{r|Avengers #293}} 

Meanwhile, the Prime Kang attempted to heal his apparent loss of Ravonna by bringing numerous alternate reality Ravonna's to slave over him, but soon he grew not to care about her any longer. He then decided to turn his energies against the first woman who betrayed him: Mantis.{{r|Avengers Annual #21}} Confident that the Inferno would cover his reappearance in the time stream from the Council of Cross-Time Kangs, attacked Mantis in New York City just as she was being rescued by the Fantastic Four. Immobilizing the Fantastic Four he kidnapped Mantis hoping to use her power as the Celestial Madonna to unleash the power of the [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|Dreaming Celestial]] slumbering in Mount Diablo, California. Not only did the Fantastic Four follow after him, but as did the sorcerer known as [[Necrodamus (Earth-616)|Necrodamus]]. When Kang arrived in California, he was shocked to find that Mantis was stripped of her powers gained from the Cotati and began pondering how to breach the barrier when the Fantastic Four arrived. Kang managed to escape the Fantastic Four but upon doing so he realized that someone had kidnapped Mantis.<ref>{{cl|Fantastic Four #323}}, [[Mantis (Brandt) (Earth-616)|Mantis]] lost her powers during the events of {{cl|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 37}} through {{cl|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #39|39}}</ref> Kang managed to track Mantis back to New York City where he found her a prisoner of Necrodamus who was preparing to sacrifice her to the demons of Limbo once the planets became aligned. Forced to team-up with the Fantastic Four to suit his own ends for Mantis, he accepted an idea provided to him by [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]]. With the Human Torch's flame powers being mystically enhanced, Kang transported the Torch outside of the orbit of planet Mercury. The Torch then buried a device deem into the planet, allowing Kang to pull the planet slightly out of alignment preventing Necrodamus from slaying Mantis. The dark gods then punished Necrodamus. With their mission over, Kang teleported away leaving the Torch stranded in space.{{r|Fantastic Four #324}} While Kang was gone the heroic X-Men and [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] ended the demonic infestation of New York.{{r|X-Factor #38}}

===Cotati===
Knowing that Mantis sought the Fantastic Four's aid to recover her [[Sequoia (Earth-616)|son]] from the Cotati, Kang went to warn them. They agreed with him that the only means to prevent her from taking their savior was to kill her. Kang brought the elders of the Cotati to New York and summoned the [[Priests of Pama (Earth-616)|Priests of Pama]] to help. However when they arrived, the Fantastic Four were reunited with the Torch thanks to the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] and they defended Mantis, defeating the Cotati and their priests. When Mantis forced the Cotati to flee with her superior mental powers, Kang fled back into the timestream once more. Following this, Mantis left her physical body to try and convince the Cotati to release her son in on the mental plane.{{r|Fantastic Four #325}}{{r|Avengers Annual #21}}

===Infinity War===
[[File:Kang and Dr. Doom working together in Infinity War Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|176px|Kang and Dr. Doom working together]]
Some years later the [[Magus (Earth-7528)|Magus]], the evil persona of [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]], was orchestrating a complex conspiracy to obtain he [[Infinity Gauntlet (Item)|Infinity Gauntlet]] and rule the universe collected a number of [[Cosmic Cube]]s and constructed a massive fortress in another dimension. On Earth, Dr. Doom detected the massive energy source and the power it was drawing from Earth. Unaware of its source and seeking to obtain this power for himself but needing an ally, Doom contacted Kang in the future. Both men agreed to work with each other while secretly plotting to betrayal when they reached their prize.{{r|Infinity War #1}} Tracing it to its receiving source on Earth, the two prepared a ship and headed off to find it.{{r|Infinity War #2}}{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #4}} They found the location of the energy source moments before the arrival of Galactus, his herald [[Frankie Raye (Earth-616)|Nova]], the Silver Surfer, and the Sorcerer Supreme [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]] who were also seeking to locate the source of the energy as Galactus tied it to the sudden incapacitation of Eternity. Seeing their arrival, Doom and Kang cloaked themselves from the view of the new arrivals.{{r|Infinity War #1}} When Galactus and his allies opened a portal to travel to the dimension the energy source was coming from, the two villains followed, cloaked from view.{{r|Infinity War #2}}{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #4}}

Detecting the approach of Galactus, the Magus attacked from afar destroying the world devourer's ship. Doom and Kang were able to slip past the wreckage and continue on the trail. Appearing in another dimension they found another trail to follow and they continued on their path. Detecting that Warlock and his [[Infinity Watch (Earth-616)|Infinity Watch]] and the mad Titan [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] was following after them they were more than pleased when a group of heroes -- also trying to track the source of the energy -- appeared and began battling with the Watch.{{r|Infinity War #3}} The two eventually made it through to the other side of the dimensional gate and materialized in front of the Magus' citadel. Sneaking inside, the pair found the power source and rigged explosives on the Cubes in the event they might lose their battle with its owner to ensure that nobody could claim it if they failed.{{r|Infinity War #4}} By the time they secretly reached the control room they found that the Magus had captured Adam Warlock and the Infinity Gauntlet. At that very moment Galactus was petitioning the [[Living Tribunal (Multiverse)|Living Tribunal]] to restore the power to the Infinity Gauntlet as the Magus had planned all along. The pair then suddenly attack the Magus, but he was too strong for Kang who was easily incapacitated. The Magus fled, and before Doom pursued after him, he killed Kang with a gauntlet blast.{{r|Infinity War #5}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} While Doom failed to obtain the Infinity Gauntlet, Adam Warlock and his allies eventually stopped the Magus.{{r|Infinity War #6}} As with previous instances, Kang's apparent demise did not prove to be permanent here as his mind was transferred to a new body in his own era.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}}

===Citizen Kang===
By this time Kang's empire spanned some six centuries with his domain of Chronopolis touching various points in time. He also formed his [[Anachronauts (Multiverse)|Anachronauts]] warriors gathered from various eras to be his elite warriors.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}} However further expansion into the multiverse was deadlocked between other opposing time controllers including the ancient creature [[Alioth (Temporal Limbo)|Alioth]], the Time Variants Authority, the Congress of Realities, [[Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-93091)|Revelation]] a future version of Ravonna,{{r|Avengers: The Terminatrix Objective #3}} and the Delubric Consortium.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} When the Vision discovered that parts of his body were created by Timely Industries in the year 1939, he went to Timely, Wisconsin to investigate and was subsequently captured by Kang. Weeks later when Captain America went to look for him, Kang had him banished to the year 2700 BC. Meanwhile, long since having escaped the Time Bubble, Kang-Nebula - revealing herself to be Kang's long lost love Ravonna - attempted to obtain the help of Dr. Druid to assist her in stopping Kang.{{r|Captain America Annual #11}} Meanwhile, Kang traveled back in time to seek out an alliance with [[Prester John (Johann) (Earth-616)|Prester John]] in the realm of [[Avalon (Otherworld)|Avalon]] sometime in the 10th century. When John refused to join Kang, the time traveler banished Prester John to the year 911 AD hoping that John would change history by preventing an alliance between King John the Simple and the Viking leader Rollo Hrolfson. Kang also banished [[Eric Masterson (Earth-616)|Thor]] to this era and he made time continue on its intended path.{{r|Thor Annual #17}}

Eventually Ravonna - now dubbed the Temptress - convinced Dr. Druid and the Fantastic Four to assist her in stopping Kang. Using the Fantastic Four's time machine they traveled to Chronopolis. There they also ran into the Avengers who were searching for their missing teammates. This led to a battle between the two groups when the Avengers presumed that Ravonna was once more manipulating people. As the two hero teams clashed, Ravonna managed to slip away and Kang unleashed his Anachronauts upon the heroes.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #25}} The FF and the Avengers were easily overpowered and imprisoned in Kang's citadel. Kang then revealed his current plans for invading the modern era: Revealing that he was behind Timely Industries he had components in almost every technological device made over the last 100 years and would use this to pave the way to his victory. Ravonna made her presence known and seemingly slew Kang, but this turned out to be yet another divergent version of Kang. The real Kang soon appeared, and impressed on this new vengeful incarnation of Ravonna, Kang challenged her to a battle. If Kang won Ravonna would stay in Chronopolis and become one of his Anachronauts. If she won, she would win the right to kill him. During the course of the battle, the heroes broke free from their prison and began battling the Anachronauts. During the course of the battle, Thor attempted to toss his hammer through the barrier that protected the two combatants. However the hammer was too strong and pierced the field. Seeing that it was about to strike Ravonna, Kang pushed her out of the way and took the blunt of the blow, severely crippling him and leaving Kang on the brink of death. Realizing the irony of the situation, Ravonna vowed to restore Kang to full health, if for nothing more than to finally get her revenge and kill him. Carrying Kang away, Ravonna allowed the heroes to leave.{{r|Avengers Annual #21}}{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}}

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) and Time-Keepers (Earth-794282) from Avengers The Terminatrix Objective Vol 1 3 001.jpg|thumb|left|Kang in suspended animation]]
===Terminatrix Objective===
Now calling herself the Terminatrix, Ravonna put Kang in stasis and in order to keep his empire in order and safe from the Council of Cross-Time Kangs, she began posing as Kang the only beings aware of her deception being the Anachronauts. She also began investigating eras earlier in time and discovered the temporal creature known as Alioth who ruled those eras and threatened to consume Kang's empire as well. Later, Ravonna's future self Revelation summoned three Avengers: [[Eric Masterson (Earth-616)|Thunderstrike]], [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]], and [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|US Agent]], to stop the Terminatrix from reviving Kang. In retaliation, the Terminatrix summoned Avengers of her own: Captain America, Iron Man and Thor.{{r|Avengers: The Terminatrix Objective #1}} While the two teams of Avengers were manipulated into fighting each other, the Terminatrix was lured to the year 9999 AD by Revelation.{{r|Avengers: The Terminatrix Objective #2}} While Kang remained in stasis his body was visited by some of the Time-Keepers, who feared that without the revival of Kang, the multiverse would suffer a Chrono-Synclastic Entropy event when Alioth finally invaded Chronopolis. Relatively, in the year 9999 Revelation convinced Terminatrix that she actually sought to assist her in defeating Alioth and provided her with advanced medicine from her point in time to cure Kang of his injuries. However before the Terminatrix could return to Chronopolis, Alioth attacked.{{r|Avengers: The Terminatrix Objective #3}}

As the Avengers battled Alioth, the Terminatrix returned and used the device given to her by Revelation and it successfully restored Kang to full health. Kang, Terminatrix and Revelation then recovered the Avengers as Alioth absorbed the Council of Cross-Time Kangs, killing them all. Equipping the Avengers with devices to protect them from the chronal-beast, Kang also gave them a weapon to destroy it: the Chrono-Key. When they attacked Alioth in the council chambers, the Chrono-Key transformed into [[Tempus (Temporal Limbo)|Tempus]], a chronal being that absorbed the latent chronal energy with the dead bodies of the Cross-Time Kangs, and Tempus was able to pull Alioth creating a time barrier preventing Alioth from becoming a threat to Chronopolis. Angry at the loss of lives the Avengers tried to confront Kang but he quickly banished them from his realm. Then when it appeared that he and Ravonna would finally reconcile their differences, she stabbed him in the back intending to revive him so that they would be considered equals in an attempt to deviate herself from the possible future where she would become Revelation.{{r|Avengers: The Terminatrix Objective #4}} Kang has later stated that he intentionally orchestrated the release of Alioth in order to eliminate the Council of Cross-Time Kangs and rule over his empire alone without their interference.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}}

Eventually Ravonna did restore Kang, and their old animosities came to an end. They returned to the 41st century to rule together however Kang soon quickly grew bored with his position which was becoming more and more bureaucratic. By the time he reached age 60, Kang had grown tired of this life and sought a more simpler time. Kang then decided to leave his entire empire under the command of Ravonna and resumed his guise of Rama-Tut and returned to Ancient Egypt for a time.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}}

===[[Destiny War]]===
[[File:Kang battles the forces of Immortus in Avengers Forever Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|292px|Kang battles the forces of Immortus]]
During his time as Rama-Tut, the former Kang assisted the Avengers and Immortus stop his past self from taking the Celestial Madonna. After which he returned to the time stream to find a new direction in life. Thanks to events occurring at the end of time,{{r|Avengers: Forever #11}} Rama-Tut diverged into two distinct individuals. One saw his mortality and decided to travel to Limbo, where he eventually became Immortus.{{r|Thor #282}} The other looked into the time stream and saw how Immortus was basically a slave to the Time-Keepers and became angry. Finding a new fire inside him, Rama-Tut denounced his future self and his indentured life to the Time-Keepers. Tut returned to the 41st Century and resumed his guise of Kang the Conqueror with new zeal.

<center>'''For more on the divergent paths of Kang see the entry on [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]]'''</center>

His first order of duty was to eliminate all rival time travelers from the playing field. He unleashed Alioth upon the TVA, and the Delubric Consortium upon Revelation. Deciding that the only way to truly relish his conquests he decided to no longer rely on an easy way out and destroyed the device that would transmit his mind into a new body upon physical death. Kang then began studying Immortus and his masters the Time-Keepers in order to learn how to avoid this eventual fate. He learned that the Time-Keepers were created at the so-called "End of Time" on [[Earth-794282]] by the final TVA agent known as [[He Who Remains (Earth-616)|He Who Remains]]. Through these observations he learned that the Time-Keepers had attempted to ensure that the universe ended with them and considered the Earth its gravest threat. During his investigations he made allies with the [[Kree]] [[Supremor (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]] and the modern era reformed criminal [[Gustav Brandt (Earth-616)|Libra]]. Together they learned that the Time-Keepers and Immortus were attempting to alter the course of human destiny by killing long time Avengers associate Rick Jones, as he contained the power of the Destiny Force.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}}

At this point in the modern era, Rick Jones was seemingly dying as a result of the energies of the Destiny Force.{{r|Incredible Hulk #470}} Knowing that the Supreme Intelligence had previously controlled the Destiny Force in Rick{{r|Avengers #97}} and brought him to the [[Blue Area]] of Earth's Moon where the Intelligence was being held prisoner by agents of [[Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]{{r|Avengers Vol 3 7}} After Rick was left with the Supreme Intelligence for observation, Immortus sent his agent Tempus to eliminate the young man. However Kang arrived just in time and began holding off armies of soldiers plucked from various periods in history by his future self. During the fight, Rick awoke and with help from the Supreme Intelligence was able to channel the Destiny Force and summon a group of Avengers from different points in history which included Captain America, Yellowjacket, the Wasp, [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Goliath]], and Hawkeye from Earth-616, as well as [[Genis-Vell (Earth-98120)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Melissa Gold (Earth-98120)|Songbird]] from [[Earth-98120|one possible future]] to help Kang.<ref>{{cl|Avengers: Forever #1}}. Each Avenger came from different points in history. [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] from {{cl|Captain America #175}}, [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] is from {{cl|Avengers #99}}, [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]] is from {{cl|Avengers #59}}, while [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Goliath]] and the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] are both from {{cl|Avengers Vol 3 11}}</ref> With the help of the Avengers and Rick's Destiny Force, Kang was able to fight off the troops summoned by Immortus. With the immediate trouble gone, Kang sent the Avengers off with Libra to seek safety while he returned to Chronopolis to prepare to wage war against his future self. However when Kang returned to his domain Immortus immediately launched an attack against him.{{r|Avengers: Forever #2}}

Chronopolis was being decimated, with the majority of the Anachronauts, including the Terminatrix, being slain by time-twisting explosion. It soon became apparent that Immortus was seeking the [[Heart of Forever]] a powerful energy source that made it possible to change history without creating divergent realities. The Avengers soon arrived to lend a hand, but Kang ushered them off in his time machine ordering them to remain out of the time stream so that Immortus could not follow them. As this was happening Immortus gained access to the Heart and used it to collapse Chronopolis, its entire population and all its chronal energies into the powerful [[Forever Crystal]].{{r|Avengers: Forever #3}} Immortus then went about pruning various realities to ensure that humanity does not follow the destiny that put them at the risk of being destroyed by the Time-Keepers, while the Avengers tried their best to oppose him.<ref>{{cl|Avengers: Forever #4}} through {{cl|Avengers: Forever #8}}</ref> Meanwhile Kang had survived the destruction of Chronopolis, escaping to a hideout hidden in the realm known as [[Purgatory]]. There he reflected on his past life up to that point before he was contacted by Rick Jones and the Supreme Intelligence and informed that the Avengers were captured and that the Time-Keepers were preparing to make their final gambit.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} They found the Avengers being placed on a mock trial by the Time-Keepers in the 26nd Century of [[Earth-9812]] where the Avengers have become an intergalactic empire, the future which the Time-Keepers were seeking to avoid.{{r|Avengers: Forever #10}} With the help of Rick's Destiny Force, Kang and the Avengers were able to break through the Time-Keepers force fields, but they and Immortus fled to the end of time on Earth-794282 to use the Forever Crystal in a Chrono-Cannon to wipe out all timelines that would create a future like Earth-9812. There Immortus refused to hand over the Crystal and was seemingly slain. Kang and the Avengers attacked again. They then unleashed an army of evil Avengers from alternate realities. When Kang fought back against the Time-Keepers who then attempted to speed up Kang's destiny and force him into transform into Immortus. The Avengers, joined by the [[Richard Jones (Earth-98120)|Rick Jones]] of Earth-98120 who was bonded to his era's Captain Marvel, summoned heroic Avengers from other eras to help fight the bad.{{r|Avengers: Forever #11}}

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) from Avengers Forever Vol 1 12 001.jpg|thumb|left|326px|The Time-Keepers try to force Kang's transformation into Immortus]]
Through sheer sense of will, Kang managed to fight off the Time-Keepers attempts to force his transformation into Immortus. In the end the Avengers triumphed, destroying the Chrono-Cannon and Kang executed the Time-Keepers in retaliation. However before he could get a hold of the Forever Crystal, Captain America smashed it. Kang was also in for another shock when he found Immortus, now a separate entity from him alive and well. When it was deduced that Kang's destiny was no longer tied to that of Immortus, the conqueror realized that he had achieved the greatest victory of all and teleported away. The Avengers were also returned to their respective eras.{{r|Avengers: Forever #12}}

===Kang Dynasty===
[[File:Kang and the Scarlet Centurion during Avengers Vol 3 40.jpg|thumb|Kang and the Scarlet Centurion prepare for war]]
Now with a free destiny, Kang began focusing again on his desire to conquer the modern era. To this end, he manipulated the hero [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]] into accepting the role of king of [[Otherworld]], removing him from the playing field when it came time for a potential invasion.{{r|Excalibur Vol 2 4}}

Returning to his empire, Kang then spent the next few decades in that era preparing his armies and ensuring only the most perfect specimens were selected. Additionally he organized a harem of genetically ideal women and began copulating with them.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 45}} Each child from these unions he named Marcus and began training them to be the ideal warrior. With each failure, he killed his offspring and sealed them in a private chamber aboard his massive space station the [[Damocles Base|Domocles]].{{r|Avengers Vol 3 54}} His last attempt elided [[Marcus Kang XXIII (Earth-6311)|Marcus XXIII]]. Marcus Kang proved to be a success, and was trained in the art of combat, war, and strategy from his father. When Marcus reached adulthood Kang gifted him with his old identity of the Scarlet Centurion.{{r|Avengers #45}} They then began monitoring the Avengers in the modern age so that Marcus could learn his foes, Kang told him to pay particular attention to Captain America. At this time the Avengers were at their highest ebb and a completely global force that was trying to strike at their various foes first before they could terrorize the free world. Kang the Centurion then began observing the Avengers battle with the [[Sergei Krylov (Earth-616)|Presence]] in Russia,{{r|Avengers Vol 3 38}} and their battle with Hulk-like creatures created by [[Jonathan Tremont (Earth-616)|Jonathan Tremont]] of the [[Triune Understanding (Earth-616)|Triune Understanding]]{{r|Avengers Vol 3 39}} before deciding it was time to launch their attack.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 40}} Arriving in the modern era, Kang coached his son on how to battle his campaign before sending him to sent a declaration of war to the United Nations in New York City. When Marcus arrived, he clashed with the Avengers and found himself instantly smitten by their member [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Warbird]]. When the Avengers refused to stand down, Kang appeared and decided to give them a show of power. He had his Damocles base fire a powerful blast and destroy the United Nations Building, but used force fields to save those inside. Kang then issued an ultimatum to the Avengers and gathered government officials: surrender or face invasion.{{r|Avengers #41}}

Kang then warned those gathered that there were many dangers ahead in the future, showing them glimpses of of the possible futures on Earths [[Earth-691|691]], [[Earth-1745|1745]], [[Earth-2042|2042]], [[Earth-6311|6311]], [[Earth-8394|8394]], [[Earth-8410|8410]], [[Earth-9014|9014]], [[Earth-9930|9930]], [[Earth-10742|10742]], [[Earth-115000|115000]], [[Earth-17342|17342]], [[Earth-45017|45017]], [[Earth-70395|70395]], and [[Earth-107342|107342]] warning that if they did not side with him humanity would die in any one of these possible futures. Kang also outlined his destiny for mankind in this era, turning them into a massive army to conquer the entire universe. Unknown to those gathered, Kang also broadcast his speech to every television, computer and radio in the world in order to cause panic and chaos across the globe and also bring out would be allies in the conflict ahead. His speech prompted the [[Atlanteans|Atlantean]] barbarians under the rule of [[Attuma (Earth-616)|Attuma]] to attack Rollo Bay, Prince Edward Island, and renegade [[Deviants]] to attack Wuwei, China. Despite all this, a representative from the United Nations denied the chance to surrender telling Kang that the people of Earth would fight. Kang advised them that he would be attacking soon, targeting France first before departing, warning them that if they attacked his base directly instead of fighting off the invasion he would react harshly.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 42}} Kang and Marcus then returned to the Damocles to prepare for war observing the Avengers battles with the Presence, Attuma and his hordes, the rogue Deviants, the terrorist organization known as [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|AIM]], the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]], and other threats.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 43}} Meanwhile Kang sent his son to gather those who pledged loyalty to his cause. Among the first crop was the villain known as [[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Whirlwind]] whose demands for star treatment only angered Kang prompting him to teleport the super-villain back to Earth to warn others to not make such bold demands in the future. While on Earth, the Avengers began liquidating their threats, but the United States government was pressuring them to deal with Kang.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 44}} Kang also spent this time observing the reformation of the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] and their battle with [[Franklin Hall (Earth-616)|Graviton]] and considered them no threat to his plans.{{r|Thunderbolts #57}} 

Getting ready to strike, Kang then ordered his son Marcus to begin mobilizing his ground troops for an assault. Meanwhile on Earth, the Avengers were dedicating themselves to defending France. However the United States government was only giving them 96 hours before they launched a fleet of [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] robots to deal with Kang, a decision that Captain America thought was a bad one, but he accepted. Things became more complicated when the so-called [[Eshu (Earth-616)|Master of the World]] made his own bid to take over Earth, erecting massive defense perimeters around every major city in the world.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 45}} Kang eventually launched his ground attack on France, and began preparing for the next salvo. Meanwhile the Avengers broke into three teams: One to defend France, another to deal with the Master, and a third group led by Captain America to try and take down the Damocles base.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 46}} Marcus later went to Earth and assisted Warbird in taking down the Master despite her reservations with him, leading to the first in a series of small betrayals against his father.<ref>{{cl|Avengers Vol 3 47}}. [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Warbird]]'s reservations toward [[Marcus Kang XIII (Earth-6311)|Marcus Kang]] was due to his resemblance to [[Marcus Immortus (Temporal Limbo)|Marcus Immortus]] the son of [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]] who manipulated Carol into a romance in order to impregnate her with himself so that he could escape [[Limbo (Temporal)|Limbo]]. When this failed he returned to Limbo with her as his unwitting slave but she eventually escaped. See {{cl|Avengers #197}} through {{cl|Avengers #200|200}} and {{cl|Avengers Annual #10}}</ref> When the Avengers later attacked the Damocles base, Marcus intentionally allowed them to break through the force field that protected it unaware that his father was standing over him. Kang chose to hide his knowledge from his son and instead focused on battling the Avengers. At that moment the United States government then launched their Sentinels at Kang's orbital base. Kang appeared in a massive holographic image, and took control of the Sentinels since they were comprised of parts built by Timely Industries. Kang then destroyed the Avenger's ship and left them floating in space and turned his holographic image and army of Sentinels on Earth.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 48}}

Kang's retaliation was swift. He launched a massive attack on Washington D.C., decimating the entire capital despite the Mighty Thor's attempts to try and stop him, leaving the city destroyed and millions of people dead and reduced to bones. Soon the United States officially surrendered and Kang insisted that the Avengers de facto leader, the Wasp, be the first to sign the declaration of surrender.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 49}} Meanwhile the Avengers trapped in space were rescued by [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]] and the [[Miguel Santos (Earth-616)|Living Lightning]]. Before returning to Earth, they had to stop Jonathan Tremont from taking control of a massive ship alien prayer ship with the help of their teammate [[Delroy Garrett Jr. (Earth-616)|Triathlon]]. After their victory they soon learned that Kang had taken the Earth.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 50}} Kang soon had nearly the entire world in his hands, but there were still pockets of resistance and he had them captured and placed in camps. In one such camp, the Scarlet Witch helped Wonder Man escape so that he could join the other Avengers still free and fighting Kang, using her Hex Powers to make it appear that Wonder Man died when Kang ordered him executed for a failed escape attempt.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 51}} Kang then focused his efforts on the last of the resistance but they began defending themselves with the Master's defenses, and their ranks were increased with the help of [[Namorita Prentiss (Earth-616)|Namorita]] and the Atlanteans, as well as [[Kro (Earth-616)|Warlord Kro]] and his Deviants, and the Presence and his mate [[Tania Belinskaya (Earth-616)|Starlight]], forcing Kang and his forces to retreat back to the Damocles. That base was suddenly approached by the Triune Ship. When Kang used his holographic projection to attack the ship he was shocked to see that the Triune craft was able to replicate the technology and do the same with Captain America.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 52}}

However Captain America proved the superior fighter and Kang was forced to retreat back into his ship. The Avengers, with the unlikely aid of Jonathan Tremont managed to piece the force field around the Damocles and Warbird then compromised the energy core. With the ship starting to explode, Kang ordered a full retreat and forced Marcus into an escape pod, sending him back to the 40th Century, telling his son to let him die in battle and begin his own destiny before the Damocles fell to Earth.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 53}} The remains of the Damocles crash landed in the town of Gaithersberg, [[Maryland (State)|Maryland]] and miraculously Kang survived the crash but his armor was severely damaged. The Avengers arrived soon and Kang challenged Captain America to a one-on-one battle. This was a battle that Kang ultimately lost and he was finally taken prisoner. Soon Kang's empire was dismantled and the Earth began to repair the damage. Kang meanwhile found himself locked in a secluded prison in Montana. There he was rescued by his son Marcus, despite his protests to be left. Kang eventually relented and returned to his ship. There Kang revealed that he knew of his son's betrayals and revealed the truth of his birth. Kang then expressed his disappointment that his son would not only betray him, but deny his wish to die in combat -- or at least by execution from his enemies and become a legend. Deeming his son as much a failure as all the versions before him, Kang fatally stabbed his son. When his computer asked if Kang wished to awaken the next Marcus, he delayed the order, allowing himself a moment of grief now having lost everything.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 54}}

===The End & JLA/Avengers===
Following this, Kang was briefly imprisoned along with other time traveler by [[Amenhotep IV (Earth-4321)|Akhenaten]] of [[Earth-4321]] until he was defeated by [[Thanos (Earth-4321)|Thanos]] and his prisoners freed.{{r|Marvel Universe: The End #2}} Later, Earth-616 was being merged with [[w:c:DC:New Earth|a distant cosmic]] by the being known as [[w:c:DC:Krona (New Earth)|Krona]] which altered history where the two vastly different universes coexisted together. According to this new reality, Kang battled with the so-called [[w:c:DC:Epoch (New Earth)|Lord of Time]] over a Chronal Egg. Both manipulated the Avengers and the [[w:c:DC:Justice League of America (New Earth)|Justice League of America]] into clashing with each other. The heroes won the battle, but these events were erased from history when Krona's merging of the two universes was halted by those self-same heroes.{{r|JLA/Avengers #3}}

Kang later traveled into his own past, saving his [[Nathaniel Richards (Iron Lad) (Earth-6311)|teenaged self]] from bullies in the hopes of helping the young Nathaniel Richards achieve his destiny as Kang the Conqueror sooner. Showing the boy his destiny, Kang also equipped him with Neuro-Kinetic armor, which proved to be a mistake. Unwilling to become a villain, the young Nathaniel Richards fought back against Kang and then escaped into the time stream and ended up in the modern era.

During their discussions at the ruins of Avengers Mansion, they were attacked by one of Kang's Growing Men. Upon the constructs defeat, it signaled Iron Lad's location to Kang.{{r|Young Avengers #3}}

[[File:Nathaniel Richards slaying his future self Kang in Young Avengers Vol 1 5.jpg|thumb|Slaying Kang]]
Kang clashed with Iron Man, Captain America, former private eye [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]], and the Young Avengers. He warned them that if Iron Lad did not return to his own time and follow his destiny to become Kang, history would be irreparably changed in catastrophic ways. Kang's appearance in the modern age alongside his younger self caused this change in history to accelerate. While the Young Avengers geared to fight Iron Lad's future self, the Avengers saw firsthand the changes that were being made and resolved to try and help Kang restore the natural order. When the Young Avengers fought back, they were easily trounced by Kang who turned Iron Lad's own armor against his teammates.{{r|Young Avengers #4}} Kang then opened a time portal to bring Iron Lad back to his own era, but was knocked in by Iron Lad's teammate [[Cassandra Lang (Earth-616)|Stature]], sealing it. Kang returned momentarily and threatened to kill Captain America, but the Young Avengers fought back even harder than before. Their ranks increased when Iron Lad converted his armor into a new incarnation of the [[Jonas (Earth-616)|Vision]]. While Kang was distracted, Nathaniel managed to sneak up behind him and fatally stab his future self through the chest with a sword, killing him.{{r|Young Avengers #5}} With the future rapidly changing and members of the Young Avengers being wiped from existence, Iron Lad realized the futility in his staying in the present and willingly returned to the future to follow his destiny and become Kang the Conqueror. This caused reality to return to the status quo.{{r|Young Avengers #6}} Kang was apparently restored to life as a result.

===Heroic Age===
When Adam Warlock became the Magus once again in order to stop the Fault, a hole in time in space caused by a T-Bomb, it ensured that the future of [[Earth-7528]] where the Magus and his Universal Church of Truth ruled the universe was the dominant future. This caused the destruction of many possible timelines, the lone survivors being each reality's version of [[Starhawk]]. Kang was warned of this impending doom from a surviving Time-Keeper before being frozen in Limbo ice. Kang sought refuge in Limbo and gathered the army of Starhawks. Witnessing members of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] trapped in the year 3009 of Earth-7528, Kang and the Starhawks rescued them. Having had their ages changed due to the Fault Kang restored them to their proper ages and informed the group of the danger to history. He offered them only one solution: kill Warlock. He then gave the Guardians' leader [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] a Cosmic Cube to help do the job. Despite the team's reservations, Kang transported them back in time to moments before Adam Warlock turned into the Magus to do the job. Star-Lord eventually succeeded in slaying the Magus, but not before many of his teammates and allies were slain. However with the Magus now dead, reality resumed its proper course.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 19}}

Kang soon became aware of the possible future of [[Earth-10071]] where the robot [[Ultron (Earth-10071)|Ultron]] slew that reality's [[Next Avengers (Earth-10071)|Avengers]] paving the way for domination of Kang's own era. To stop this, Kang gathered an army of heroes to destroy Ultron, but failed. In retaliation, Kang went back and gathered more and more super-humans and failed over 20 times.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 4}} His constant time travels caused too much of a strain on time and broke it causing chaos across the time stream, causing different eras to bleed into each other while causing the battle between Ultron on Earth-10071 to continue in a perpetual loop. This prompted his future self, Immortus, to pose as Kang once more and convince the [[Next Avengers (Earth-10071)|Next Avengers]] to allow himself to travel back in time to recruit the Avengers of the modern era to fix the fracture in time.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 1}} The Avengers eventually traveled to Earth-10071 and learned of the situation and agreed to deal with Ultron.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 4}} They went back in time prior to the battle with Ultron and convinced the robot to lose the battle, pointing out that in fighting Kang would lead to the damage done to the time stream and that Ultron would no be destroyed as well. Ultron agreed, and when the time for the battle came, Kang and his forces easily destroyed him. With such a quick victory, Kang returned his warriors to their proper points in history. Disappointed with the lack of a challenge, Kang returned to his own time to continue searching for a suitable conquest. With the defeat of Ultron, reality diverged to a new future of [[Earth-10943]], and the damage to the time stream was repaired.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 6}}

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) and the Apocalypse Twins (Earth-616) from Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|left|196px|Kang and the Apocalypse Twins]]
===Apocalypse Twins===
With the birth of the [[Apocalypse Twins (Earth-616)|Apocalypse Twins]], Kang began to see them as a threat to his future time and began orchestrating a means to not only eliminate the threat of mutants to his future time, but also to gain mastery of all time and ensure that his rule reigned unopposed. To this end, Kang kidnapped the twins, [[Uriel (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Uriel]] and [[Eimin (Earth-616)|Eimin]] just moments after their birth, taking them into the future to raise them.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #5}} He then traveled back in time to the year 1013 AD and took on his Rama-Tut guise and began manipulating once sought after heir, Apocalypse, convincing him that he was destined to rule the world by feeding him half truths about the coming future. Through his gained trust, he tricked Apocalypse into fighting a young Thor in Scandinavia, knowing that the armor given to Apocalypse by the [[Celestials]] would be immune to Thor's ax [[Jarnbjorn]]. Seeing that he was losing the fight, Thor fled back to [[Asgard]] to petition his father [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] to give him the power to defeat Apocalypse. As expected, Odin turned down this request due to the oath Earth's pantheon gods made to not interfere in the work of the Celestials. Posing as Thor's brother [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]], Kang used Thor's anger to trick him into working together to find a solution to stop Apocalypse. Kang then uncovered a spell hidden in Odin's library that could give Jarnbjorn the power to destroy Celestial armor. Kang then resumed his Rama-Tut guise and tricked Apocalypse into going after [[Folkbern Logan (Earth-616)|Folkbern Logan]] a soldier in England who was an ancestor of the modern day hero [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]. When Apocalypse and his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horsemen]] attacked England to slay Logan, Thor arrived and battled him, slaying these Horsemen and gravely wounding Apocalypse, although Apocalypse teleported away and lived on for centuries thereafter. When Thor returned to Asgard to celebrate, he was berated by Odin who warned that his actions that day would one day have grave repercussions on the world. With the first part of his scheme complete, Kang returned to the modern era where he recovered Jarnbjorn from [[Brazil]] where it was embedded in the body of the deceased sorcerer [[Karl Mordo (Earth-616)|Baron Mordo]] in a Brazilian tomb.<ref>{{cl|Uncanny Avengers #6}}. How [[Karl Mordo (Earth-616)|Baron Mordo]]'s body ended up in this tomb with Jarnbjorn embedded in it is as yet unexplained, he was last seen alive in {{cl|Iron Man/Thor #1}}</ref>

Kang then began raising the Apocalypse Twins in the year 4145, teaching them that mutants and humans could never live in harmony together and that the twins would grow up to oppose Kang himself and they would meet defeat. To show them how the fight for supremacy was a lost cause for the twins, Kang forced them to live out years of their lives in mutant concentration camps run by the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-13044)|Red Skull]] on [[Earth-13044]]. There they were forced to live in a camp run by the cyborg known as [[Roderick Campbell (Earth-13044)|Ahab]]. When Uriel and Eimin attempted to escape Kang watched over them gloating, and allowed them to be captured by Ahab and his Hounds. When Ahab caught them, Kang stood back and watched as Uriel was forced to blind his sister by cutting her eyes out with his wings.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #12}} Convinced that they had learned enough about human cruelty, Kang took the now teenaged Apocalypse Twins back to his future of 4145 to continue their training. He sent them on a mission to [[Earth-26111]] to slay [[Steven Rogers (Earth-26111)|Colonel America]]. This instead led to a battle with the [[Morlocks (Earth-26111)|Morlocks]] and Uriel and Eimin were forced to slay their leaders [[Alexander Summers (Earth-26111)|Havok]] and [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-26111)|Rogue]]. After their failure, he brought them back to his own time and showed them his trophy room, including Jarnbjorn.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #8AU}}

===Avenge the Earth===
[[File:Kang Dynasty (Earth-6311) being destroyed from Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 12.jpg|thumb|right|Kang watches powerless as his timeline is destroyed]]
However before Kang could continue his conditioning of the Apocalypse Twins, they stole Jarnbjorn and returned to the modern era of Earth-616. Using the weapon they slew the Celestial known as [[Arishem (Earth-616)|Arishem the Judge]], just as it was summoned by the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse. They then started a campaign to create a mutant rapture, to move the mutant population to a new world before the Celestials sought retribution. This plot was opposed by the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]] in vein. Ultimately, the Apocalypse Twins succeeded in manipulating the Scarlet Witch into succeeding in their plan, and the Earth was destroyed by [[Exitar (Earth-616)|Exitar the Executioner]]. In order to prevent Kang, or any other time travelers from going back in time and stopping them, the twins also constructed a tachyon dam that protected the entire timeline.<ref>[[Uriel (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Uriel]] and [[Eimin (Earth-616)|Eimin]]'s plot took place over the course of {{cl|Uncanny Avengers #7}} through {{cl|Uncanny Avengers #17|17}}</ref> It was by this point that Kang's latest incarnation of [[Marcus Kang (Earth-6311)|Marcus]] realized that the Apocalypse Twins escaped and attempted to warn his father. However Kang was already being told what the Apocalypse Twins were up to thanks to holographic recordings that were rigged to go off just as Kang's timeline was beginning to be erased.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #12}}

Kang began gathering other beings from futures that were being wiped out thanks to the work of the Apocalypse Twins. Forming the [[Chronos Corps (Multiverse)|Chronos Corps]] which consisted of [[Nathaniel Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]] of [[Earth-4935]], [[May Parker (Earth-9997)|Venom]] of [[Earth-9997]], [[Victor von Doom (Earth-6375)|Dr. Doom]] of [[Earth-6375]], [[Arno Stark (Earth-8410)|Iron Man]] of [[Earth-8410]], [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-12928)|Magistrate Braddock]] of [[Earth-12928]], [[Roderick Campbell (Earth-13044)|Ahab]] of [[Earth-13044]], and the [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-11045)|Abomination Deathlok]] of [[Earth-11045]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers #14}} However he and his forces were unable to affect changes in the present day thanks to the tachyon dam. About a decade later, the mutants had established themselves on a new world called [[Planet X]]. By this time both [[Alexander Summers (Earth-13133)|Havok]] and the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-13133)|Wasp]] had gotten married and had a human child named [[Katie Summers (Earth-13133)|Katie]]. In order to create a safer world for their daughter, Alex and Janet managed to destroy the tachyon dam that existed in their era, allowing Kang and his Chronos Corps to breach that point in history, which allowed them to also recruit [[Thor Odinson (Earth-13133)|Thor]] to their cause.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #18.NOW}} Kang came up with a plan to restore the Earth, but with the tachyon dam in the past preventing them from going further, Kang came up with a plan to send the minds of the surviving members of the Avengers Unity team into their past bodies and preventing the destruction of Earth. When Havok protested due to concerns he had over the fate of his daughter, who could be erased from history by such a move, Kang teleported her away into the timestream in order to force his and the Wasp's support. In attempting to free the captured [[James Howlett (Earth-13133)|Wolverine]] and [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-13133)|Sunfire]] Kang and his minions clashed with the [[X-Council (Earth-13133)|X-Council]] and [[X-Force (Earth-13133)|X-Force]] as well as the [[Apocalypse Twins (Earth-13133)|Apocalypse Twin]]'s minions [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-13133)|Banshee]] and [[Akihiro (Earth-13133)|Daken]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers #19}} Succeeding in their task, with the help of Magistrate Elizabeth, Kang managed to send the minds of Thor, Wolverine, Havok, the Wasp, and Sunfire back in time to the moments leading up to the destruction of Earth.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #20}}

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) from Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 21 001.jpg|thumb|left|Cosmic powered Kang]]
The heroes travel into the past and with the help of [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] and the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] managed to keep Exitar at bay while they recovered Jarnbjorn from the Apocalypse Twins. As Thor wounded Exitar, the other members of the Unity Team destroyed the tachyon dam, allowing Kang and his forces to arrive in that era. This was the final culmination of Kang's schemes and he had his Abomination Deathlok push Thor into the cosmic energy spewing from the wounded Celestial. Kang then began attempting to absorb the cosmic energy, hoping to attain godhood and conquer all time.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #21}} The Avengers clashed with Kang's Chronos Corps and were assisted by the arrival of Immortus and his [[Infinity Watch (Multiverse)|Infinity Watch]] while Havok and Sunfire attempted to prevent Kang from absorbing more energy from the Celestial. While Sunfire defeated the Apocalypse Twins, Havok overpowered Kang and severed him from the Celestial energies. Defeated, Kang fled into the timestream taking his Chronos Corps with him. However he left Ahab behind to find the [[Johann Shmidt (Clone) (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] and ensure that the future of Earth-13044 came to pass.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #22}} Because Exitar was prevented from destroying the Earth and the Apocalypse Twins were defeated before they could complete their rapture, reality continued on its natural course, although the Planet X reality endured in a divergent reality designated [[Earth-13133]]. 

===Original Sin===
Kang eventually ended up working with two of his alternate selves, Immortus and Iron Lad, at a point in time and space called the "end of the road" to await the arrival of the "last Avenger".{{r|Avengers Vol 5 34}} This came in the form of Captain America who was being hurtled forward through time thanks to the damaged [[Time Stone|Time]] [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Gem]]. He was rescued from the fractured timestream by Iron Lad after surviving an experience some 51,028 years in the future.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 33}} Iron Lad then brought Cap before Kang and Immortus. When the Time Gem reappeared the three time travelers trapped it in a bottle of "No-Time" to prevent it from functioning and sending Cap through time yet again. They explained to Cap that the current crisis threatening to destroy the multiverse was destined to fail if they allowed Cap to continue going forward, Iron Lad's future selves having already lived this moment. However Cap refused to stand back and do nothing when lives were in danger and broke the Time Gem free, and was transported back to his own era before the three incarnations of Kang could stop him.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 34}}

===Inhumanity===
After [[Attilan]], the city of the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]], was destroyed by [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] during his fight with [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]],{{r|Infinity #3}} the Inhumans that were scattered were found except for Black Bolt's son [[Ahura Boltagon (Earth-616)|Ahura]]. Kang had teleported him to his fortress and took him under his wing. When Black Bolt eventually found Ahura, he submitted him to the [[Terrigenesis]] process and made a deal with Kang: Kang would take Ahura to safety into the time stream in order to save him from the death of the universe brought about by the [[Glossary:Incursion|Incursions]]. Kang accepted but with the condition that even if the Multiverse was restored, Ahura would be his forever.{{r|Uncanny Inhumans #0}}

When the universe was restored, Black Bolt reneged on his deal with Kang and decided to get his son Ahura back. With the help of [[Reader (Inhuman) (Earth-616)|Reader]], Black Bolt traveled back 13,000 years into the past, where Kang would leave Ahura in the care of [[Randac (Earth-616)|Randac]] in Attilan to accommodate him to Terrigenesis and then retrieve him some time later. However, Kang caught onto Black Bolt's betrayal and forced him to retreat.{{r|Uncanny Inhumans #1}}

The Inhumans decide to rescue the untainted Ahura from his [[Ahura Boltagon (Earth-16132)|future fate]] by travelling back in time 13,000 years ago to the moment Kang delivered Ahura to Randac. After Kang left, the Inhumans arrived to Attilan to retrieve him. Ahura didn't believe what his fellow Inhumans said and remained loyal to Kang until he was shown with the [[Historikon]] what he would have been manipulated to do, and how that future would have played out. Kang subsequently returned to the scene with an army consisting of soldiers from different periods of time in order to retrieve Ahura. After being captured, Ahura manifested his Inhuman ability to create psychic projections of himself to possess Kang, forcing him to leave, fix the damage he had done to the Inhumans' history, and never attempt to harm his people again.{{r|Uncanny Inhumans #4}}

===Split===
Due to a glitch in the timestream, Kang found himself being split up into various versions of himself. One of those versions, [[Nathaniel Richards (Mister Gryphon) (Earth-6311)|Mr. Gryphon]], found himself stuck in modern day Earth-616.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers #6}}

===Infinity Conflict===
When Kang travelled to the year 4657 where he saw an [[Thanos (Earth-TRN802)|omnipotent Thanos]] battling a [[Hunger (Devourer of Realities) (Multiverse)|horde of dark creatures]] which ended in his defeat leaving reality to be consumed by the stygian darkness. After observing how this darkness consumed the worlds, Kang sought to find the source of the problem. His search lead him to the planet of [[Zelchia]], where a [[Alien Mutants|mutant native]] developed the power to teleport. Kang tried to end the threat by killing the native, but other teleporting mutant natives emerged. With this task failed Kang sought to study the darkness, but his ship was damaged and was left stranded in the year 4012 where he encountered [[Starfox]]. After some negotiating Kang send Starfox back to the point where the Titan send his past self in exile. After Starfox's plan to avoid the threat succeeded, Kang returned to Zelchia in the year 2127 where Thanos, controlled by his omnipotent future self, awaited him and after Thanos assured that the plan was a success Kang left.{{r|Thanos: The Infinity Siblings Vol 1 1}}

The omnipotent future Thanos then trapped Kang in stasis, since he was potential threat to his plans. After Thanos absorbed the [[Adam Warlock (Earth-19141)|Living Tribunal]] and the [[One-Above-All (Multiverse)|One-Above-All]], [[Adam Warlock]] freed Kang and told him his plan to stop Thanos from destroying the entire [[Multiverse]]. As the omnipotent Thanos was about to end it all, Kang prevented Starfox and [[Pip the Troll]] from travelling through time, causing Thanos to get distracted and allowing present Thanos to take hold of his powers and reset everything to prior the machinations of future Thanos. After preventing Eros from stealing his technology, he rescued Adam and agreed to travel through time once again to fetch the green [[Soul Stone|Soul Gem]].{{r|Thanos: The Infinity Ending Vol 1 1}}

| Powers                  = '''Increased Lifespan''': Kang is over 70 years old chronologically, but the people of his era have improved biology to the point that they seem to age much slower than 21st century man. Thus he appears to be a man in his mid-40s.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}}
| Abilities               = '''Superior-level Intellect:''' Though it is hard to gauge Kang's intellect given his futuristic origins, his genius is nothing short of super-human by modern standards. He commands technology beyond the most sophisticated designs of [[Stark Industries]] and Doctor Doom, and has made breakthroughs in time travel and in robotics. Kang is the only known time traveler (other than his counterpart Immortus) who possess the ability to travel through time without creating divergences. In fact Kang has the combined knowledge and experience of his counterparts from across the Multiverse.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} Furthermore, while employing the vast resources of his empire, and when using his time-ship to penetrate the trans-dimensional realm of Limbo, from which all future eras are accessible, Kang theoretically has access to technology from any century, and presumably from alien worlds as well. Hence, in combination with the multiple resources available to him, Kang showed to have in his possession rare artifacts such as the last [[Cosmic Cube]], demonstrating expertise to effortlessly manipulate it.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 19}} It may also include artifacts such as the [[Forever Crystal]], which is capable to erase whole realities from existence.{{r|Avengers: Forever #5}}

'''Political Savvy:''' Kang is a brilliant military tactician and a peerless general. Using his considerable charisma, Kang was able to raise an army and conquer his first world within mere weeks of building his armor. Kang has conquered everything within 100 light years from Other Earth, totaling "a thousand thousand" worlds,{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}} which include the counterpart Badoon and [[Shi'ar Empire|Shi'ar]] empires of his reality, extending to several other dimensions. Though he considers it a chore, Kang is also a capable statesman. Kang is portrayed as commonly underestimating the amazing power provided by a Cosmic Cube, suggesting that he prefers to conquer worlds via more conventional and less exceptional means.{{r|Avengers: Forever #9}}

[[File:Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) from Young Avengers Vol 1 5 001.jpg|right|thumb|Kang conquers]]

'''Skilled Combatant:''' Kang is a master of both armed and unarmed combat. He has managed to go toe-to-toe with Captain America, and single-handedly held back Immortus' time-tossed army for several minutes during the Destiny War. 

'''Indomitable Will:''' Through sheer force of will, Kang managed to separate himself from his future counterpart Immortus to make himself a distinct entity.{{r|Avengers: Forever Vol 1 12}} Kang is absolutely fearless, and will stop at nothing to accomplish his own goals.

** '''Enhanced Strength:''' Gives Kang the ability to lift 5 tons.
** '''Durability:''' The armor has a built in force-field that extends from 2 feet away from his body, outward to 20 feet in all directions. It can withstand even a nuclear strike at point blank range.
** '''Anti-Gravity Device:''' Kang has a device in the gauntlets of his armor that allows him to render objects weighing up to 2.2 tons weightless.
** '''Video Communicator:''' Built into the right wrist is a video communicator, which he can use to stay in contact with his bases from any point in the time-stream.
** '''Time Travel:''' Kang's armor can create temporal divergences, giving him the ability to travel through and manipulate time.
** '''Concussive Bolts:''' Kang can fire concussive blasts from the fingertips of his gauntlets; these blasts have the force of several tons of dynamite.
** '''Weaponry:''' By cracking his fingers, Kang can summon any number of weapons which are transported to him through time-stream instantly.
** '''Electric Shock:''' By flexing his muscles, Kang can activate a powerful electric shock.
** '''Hover Pad:''' Kang has often made use of a hover-pad in his battles.
** '''Survival Kit:''' Kang's armor has a self-contained atmosphere, 30 day supply of food, and waste disposal system.
** '''Body Transference:''' Until recently, Kang employed nano-technology in his helmet's circuitry that enabled him to transfer his mind into a new body at the moment of death.
* '''[[Kang's Light of the Centuries Sphere]]:''' A sphere that can transport people through space and time. It can also hold people captured in itself.{{r|Avengers #69}} It travels at faster than light speeds,{{r|Incredible Hulk #135}} probably fueled by a virtually inexhaustible energy source, or alternatively by accessing hyperspace.

| Transportation          = Possesses a [[Time-Ship|large space ship]], capable of travel through both time and space.
| Weapons                 = He typically carries various weapons, such as an [[Glossary:A#Anti-Matter|anti-matter]] defense screen generator, a "vibration-ray" projector, an electromagnetic field amplifier, neutrino-ray warhead missile launcher (handgun size), electrical paralysis generator, nerve gas sprayer and a molecular expander. He commands a vast array of warriors from across all periods of time, including his own future era, armed with advanced weaponry. He used numerous robots, most notably his [[Growing Man]] stimuloids, packed with the "Growth Pollen" of the world [[Kosmosians|Kosmos,]] which causes them to grow in size and strength by absorbing kinetic energy; this Growth Pollen uses the same energy accessed via the size-changing "[[Pym Particles]]" discovered by [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Dr Hank Pym]].
