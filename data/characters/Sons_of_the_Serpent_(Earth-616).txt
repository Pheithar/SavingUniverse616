| HistoryText             = The Sons of the Serpent were a racist group created by [[Supreme Serpent|General Chen]] in an attempt to divide America, performing hate-crimes against foreigners around the country. After his followers attacked [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Bill Foster]], the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] publicly opposed them. The Serpents retaliated by kidnapping [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and threatening to kill him unless the Avengers would publicly take the Serpent's side. The Avengers and [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] freed Captain America and unmasked General Chen as their leader.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 32|33}}

===Sons of the Serpent II===
The Sons of the Serpent were reformed by two talk show hosts, [[Dan Dunn (Earth-616)|Dan Dunn]] and [[Montague Hale (Earth-616)|Montague Hale]], trying to stir up racial distrust and hate. They were defeated and exposed by the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 73|74}}

===Sons of the Serpent III===
The Sons of The Serpent were reformed yet again, being financed by [[J.C. Pennysworth (Earth-616)|J.C. Pennysworth]] of [[Richmond Enterprises]], who was an African-American posing as a white racist in pursuit of power. The Sons of the Serpent were destroying tenement buildings in Harlem, attempting to drive African-Americans, Puerto Ricans and other minority groups out of their city. They were foiled in this attempt by the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]].{{r|Defenders Vol 1 22|25}}

===Sons of the Serpent IV===
An iteration of the Sons of Serpent became involved in the criminal underworld of Los Angeles. Under the leadership of the [[Animus (Hate-Monger) (Earth-616)|Hate Monger]], they were selling guns and drugs to the street gangs of Los Angeles. The drugs they purchased from [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] and the state-of-the-art guns were purchased from [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]]. Due to the [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]], their operation was shut down and both Hydra and A.I.M. turned on the Sons of the Serpent.{{r|Marvel Presents Vol 1 152|155}}

===Sons of the Serpent V===
The fourth Sons of the Serpent were led by the demonic [[Serpent-Men|Serpent Man]] [[Daboia (Earth-616)|Russell Daboia]]. This incarnation of the group was involved more in mysticism, including references to the Serpent Men's deity [[Set (Earth-616)|Set]].

===Sons of the Serpent VI===
A fifth iteration of the team has been discovered. They are a hate group who control the New York justice system for profit and for their own ends. They are opposed by [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 3 #30}}

===Sons of the Serpent VII===
Another version of the Sons of the Serpent patrolled the American border to apprehend illegal immigrants, while at the same time kidnapping any healthy adult males and shipping them to [[Karlin Malus (Earth-616)|Dr. Karl Malus]] so he could use them as test subjects for his experiments. They were stopped by [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America]] with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s assistance.{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson Vol 1 2}}
