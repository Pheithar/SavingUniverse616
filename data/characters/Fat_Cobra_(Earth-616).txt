===Early Life===
The man known only as Fat Cobra was born 111 years ago on [[Peng Lai Island]], one of the legendary seven capital cities of Heaven. His parents were pig farmers, and [[Mo Chou (Earth-616)|his mother]] died giving birth to him. As an infant, his appetite proved so great that his father could not afford to feed him, and he was left on the doorstep of an orphanage. As he grew, the orphanage found him to be a burden, and at the age of two years old, he was banished from Peng Lai. After his exile from Peng Lai, he was taken in by a Peking opera school and was trained in dance and acrobatics, as well as his first instruction in the martial arts. He went on to become one of the most promising young opera singers in all of China. He spent several years traveling with the Peking opera.

He first killed in a coffeehouse in [[Cairo (Egypt)|Cairo]] in 1924, in what started out as a drunken argument, and ended with Fat Cobra punching the other man through a wall.

He then fled back to [[China]] and joined the army. He used different identities and fought for both sides in the Chinese Civil War, with both sides wanting to make him a general. He used the money he had earned to buy his way back into Peng Lai and began learning at a Kung Fu school ran by Iron-Crutch Khan. It was Khan who gave him the name Fat Cobra. His ultimate goal was to defeat [[Xiang Yao (Earth-616)|Xiang Yao]], the great snake who lived in the caves under Peng Lai. Doing so, he would earn the right to join the ranks of the Seven Immortal Weapons. Two days after his first attempt to defeat Xiang Yao, he washed up on the shores of the Chinese mainland, beaten to a pulp, partially eaten, and barely alive. He was found by a deformed old woman who lived along the shore. She nursed him back to health, but took advantage of him sexually all the time he was comatose. After recovering, he discovered that he had been exiled from Peng Lai a second time.
