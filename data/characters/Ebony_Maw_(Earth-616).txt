===Butcher Squadron===
Ebony Maw began his life as a servant of [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] in the elite team of killers named the [[Butcher Squadron (Earth-616)|Butcher Squadron]]. Like all the other pirates, soldiers and mercenaries Thanos gathered to form his crew, Maw and the Butcher Squadron lived in the space station [[Zero Sanctuary (Vehicle)|Zero Sanctuary]]. In his time there, Maw started observing Thanos in order to better understand him. He noticed that the Mad Titan gave them orders whenever someone of his crew mysteriously disappeared, correctly guessing Thanos was behind it.<!-- {{r|Thanos Vol 3 1}} -->

After the Butcher Squadron slaughtered the [[Zen-Whoberis]] to prevent the [[Magus (Earth-7528)|Magus]] from converting them into members of his [[Universal Church of Truth (Earth-616)|Universal Church of Truth]],{{r|Thanos Vol 3 1}} Thanos took the only remaining member of their species, a girl named [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]], as a prisoner. Seeing as the girl was somehow important to Thanos, Maw planned to let her out of her cell in the hopes that he could ingratiate her to the Butcher Squadron, but she ran away. He then convinced the other members of the Butcher Squadron to help him find her so he could return her to Thanos. That way, Maw intended to show Thanos that his own underlings could take his new obsession away from him, which would in turn make the Mad Titan look vulnerable in front of the rest of his crew. However, Thanos found her first and killed one of their own, [[Infesti Macera (Earth-616)|Infesti Macera]], for their negligence.{{r|Thanos Vol 3 2}}

When the other servants of Thanos began to question him, Maw took advantage of the situation to influence them into helping him kidnap Gamora, planning to use her to get what the Butcher Squadron wanted from Thanos:{{r|Thanos Vol 3 3}} [[Zero Sanctuary (Vehicle)|Zero Sanctuary]]. That plan didn't work out, however, as Gamora was able to defeat her captors and return to the space station safely. Not knowing the Butcher Squadron was behind Gamora's kidnapping, Thanos ordered them to take her captors to the brig while she accompanied them. Seemingly taking Gamora for a baby, the Black Squadron talked about their plan of taking over Zero Sanctuary right in front of her, prompting her to go after Thanos to tell him all about it. They tried to intercept her before she could do so, even going as far as to start a full-scale mutiny on Zero Sanctuary, but failed. Instead of dealing with the situation at hand, Thanos abandoned the space station in order to confront the Magus, leaving Gamora surrounded by enemies.{{r|Thanos Vol 3 4}}

After Gamora fought her way out of Zero Sanctuary, resulting in the apparent death of [[Ballista Grim (Earth-616)|Ballista Grim]],{{r|Thanos Vol 3 5}} Maw and [[Proxima Midnight (Earth-616)|Proxima Midnight]] discovered Thanos' plan to launch it on the Universal Church of Truth's fleet and fled. Months after the destruction of Zero Sanctuary, Maw and Midnight met with Thanos aboard [[Sanctuary (Vehicle)|Sanctuary I]], where the Mad Titan congratulated them for getting the jump on him and turned them into the first members of his [[Black Order (Earth-616)|Black Order]].{{r|Thanos Vol 3 6}}

===Attacking Ego===
Years later, Ebony Maw and the other members of the Black Order served Thanos against [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego the Living Planet]], whose very existence was an offense to [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]]. Their battle ultimately ended in a stalemate. Unbeknownst to Thanos, Maw had commissioned an alien named [[Trynka (Earth-616)|Trynka]], whose race was capable of recording experience within their D.N.A., to record the whole ordeal for posterity.{{r|Thanos: A God Up There Listening Infinite Comic Vol 1 1|6}}

===Invading Earth===
When Thanos targeted [[Earth]] as the next planet he would raze, Ebony Maw was dispatched to deal with [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 8}} Using his abilities to gain control over Doctor Strange, Maw forced him to summon [[Shuma-Gorath (Multiverse)|Shuma-Gorath]],{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 2}} and serve as a double-agent for him when he reunited with the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]]. When the Illuminati headed to numerous locations around the world to find Thanos' son, [[Thane (Earth-616)|Thane]], Doctor Strange found the boy in a hidden Inhuman town named [[Orolla]] in [[Greenland]]. Maw remained in the location, and forced Strange to forget about the discovery and leave, now freed from his control.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 10}}

After [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] detonated a [[Terrigen Bomb]] which unleashed a compound close to the [[Terrigen Mists]] upon the entire face of Earth, Thanos' son, Thane, underwent [[Terrigenesis]]. The manifestation of his powers annihilated the entire town.{{r|Infinity Vol 1 4}} Posing as an ally, Maw offered Thane a suit to control his powers, but also captured him in a containment field, followed by Maw alerting Thanos to the location of his son.{{r|Infinity Vol 1 5}} When the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] arrived in Orollan in order to defeat Thanos, Ebony Maw tested Thane by freeing him. Thane could escape, or could fight Thanos and become what he had avoided his entire life. The boy agreed and embraced his true nature as the son of Thanos by fighting his father. Using the power of his right hand, Thane trapped Thanos and his ally Proxima Midnight in an amber construct which left them in a state of "living death." Upon the defeat of Thanos, Ebony Maw started disciplining Thane into becoming something greater than Thanos and or anyone else.{{r|Infinity Vol 1 6}}

===Leading Thane===
[[File:Infinity Vol 1 6 Generals Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]
In order to germinate nihilistic madness in Thane, Ebony Maw took him to the planet [[Malady]] to show his father's murderous handiwork through the psychic flashes of Trynka. In the process, Maw mentally manipulated Thane into believing he was part of his imagination, having died in the battle against Ego.{{r|Thanos: A God Up There Listening Infinite Comic Vol 1 1|6}} When [[J'son (Earth-616)|J'son]] approached Thane to offer him the chance of magnifying his power via the [[Black Vortex]], Maw convinced Thane to follow the man to steal his power for his own.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 8}} While Thane was able to amplify his power by submitting to the Black Vortex,{{r|Nova Vol 5 28}} he failed to steal it due to the interference of [[Gara (Viscardi) (Earth-616)|Gara]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 8 14}}

Thane's journey of conquest eventually led him to reach the [[Black Quadrant]], a territory of Thanos which had fallen into the hands of [[Corvus Glaive (Earth-616)|Corvus Glaive]], one of Ebony Maw's former teammates at the Black Order. Having taken the necessary precautions, Glaive enlisted the help of the mythical trio of witches known as the [[Coven (Witches) (Earth-616)|Coven]] to strip Thane of his power, leading to his and Ebony Maw's capture. During the following eight months he spent apprehended, Thane believed that Ebony Maw would rescue him; however, at some point during that time, Ebony Maw had managed to talk his way out of captivity and fled.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 4}}

===The Challenger's Contest===
Ebony Maw was brought back into the reassembled Black Order by the [[Challenger (Elder of the Universe) (Earth-616)|Challenger]], an adversary of the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] whose champions were set to fight the Grandmaster's own [[Lethal Legion (Grandmaster) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]] as part of a contest of cosmic scale.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 677}} Before the game's start, both teams were teleported to Earth to survey it, since it had been chosen as battleground. Following a brief skirmish that was cut short by the gamemasters since the contest hadn't started yet,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 676}} the Black Order decided to attack the [[Avengers Mansion]], exploding it by surprise to prevent its heroes from becoming obstacles. The Avengers survived, however, as they had been teleported to safety by [[Va Nee Gast (Earth-616)|Voyager]] at the last second.

When the first round started, Ebony Maw was among the half of the Black Order dispatched to Cusco, [[Peru]], where one of the two [[Pyramoids]] placed on Earth by the gamemasters was located. The confrontation between the forces of the Black Order and the Lethal Legion was interrupted by the arrival of a group of Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 677}} Since the other Pyramoid had been seized by [[Black Dwarf (Earth-616)|Black Dwarf]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 678}} the round ended after the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] of the Avengers touched the Pyramoid in Cusco. Both were teleported to the Grandmaster's Cosmic Game Room, though in a way it seemed like they had been disintegrated.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 679}} The following round, the remaining members of the Black Order in their entirety traveled to [[Antarctica]] to take possession of one of the two new Pyramoids deployed. They were attacked by the Avengers,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 680}} and in the process Ebony Maw was knocked down. Following Corvus Glaive's death at the hands of [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], the remaining members of the Black Order that were on their feet, Proxima Midnight and [[Yabbat Ummon Turru (Earth-1365)|Black Swan]], decided to retreat.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 680}}

===The Grandmaster's Wager===
Following the end of the contest and the Avengers' victory over the Challenger, the Black Order regrouped and escaped to the planet [[Angargal]], where they were approached by the Grandmaster with an offer:{{r|Avengers Vol 1 690}} to bring down the [[Sinnarian Empire]] by destabilizing the worlds under its rule. Thinking this would be a worthy challenge, the Black Order accepted. They were apprehended days after initiating their mission and put in jail to await their execution.{{r|Black Order Vol 1 1|2}} During this time, Maw accepted to become a spy for Attican in exchange for the death of Corvus, as he planned to take over the Black Order as well as the Black Quadrant after that.{{r|Black Order Vol 1 4|5}} The [[Resistance (Sinnarian) (Earth-616)|Resistance]] later broke the Black Order out of prison because of their shared goal and informed them about the [[Bow of Gabriel]], a cosmic weapon of the empire capable of bringing entire planets to heel in a matter of hours. Wanting to restore the Black Quadrant to its former glory and expand its reach to the entire universe, the Black Order started planning a way to steal the weapon instead of destroying it like the Resistance wanted.{{r|Black Order Vol 1 2}}

After the location of the rebel base was compromised by Maw, the rebel leader [[Krannig (Earth-616)|Peacemaker]] sent the Black Order to intercept a ship transporting an ultra-rare metal called [[Onducium]], which was needed to forge the arrows for the bow. Despite the attack of a mind-controlled [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]], they were able to secure the metal. Maw revealed himself to be the spy by disappearing soon after revealing the location of the new rebel base to Attican, resulting in the capture of Peacemaker.{{r|Black Order Vol 1 3|4}} He then manipulated Attican into lowering [[Sinnar]]'s defenses, giving him the opportunity to steal the bow and reunite with the rest of his team, abandoning his original plan to get Corvus killed. Corvus used the bow to turn everyone present, except for the Black Order, into twisted monsters. With their task complete, the Grandmaster arrived and explained he had bet with the emperor that his empire based on fear could be brought down by only five individuals. Having finally won his bet, he claimed the bow and left the Black Order to their next business.{{r|Black Order Vol 1 5}}
