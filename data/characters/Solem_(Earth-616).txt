| History                 = Solem is an Arakkii mutant with [[Adamantium]] skin. 100 years ago, [[Bracken (Earth-616)|Bracken]] challenged Solem, who then killed him. For this murder, Solem was imprisoned in the pit of the [[Tower of Broken Will]]. Bracken's wife, [[War (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|War]], gave Solem Bracken's [[Hellblade (Blade)|Hellblade]] believing that the solitude would drive him mad and that he would kill himself with it. However, Solem was undaunted as he actually enjoyed the solitude, while other Arakkii who still adored him came to visit and brought him gifts. As Solem was one of the chosen individuals for [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Saturnyne]]'s [[X of Swords|Ten of Swords]] challenge, War and [[Pestilence (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|Pestilence]] were forced to break him free in order to win the challenge.{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 6}}

After getting the information he needed from the Oracle of Arakko, Solem used the Hellblade to access [[Hell]]. There he met his opponent, [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], imprisoned while regenerating. After he introduced himself to Logan, the two were forced to cooperate in order to get their hands on the [[Muramasa Blade]]. They went looking for [[Muramasa (Earth-616)|Muramasa]] himself, who had become a slave for the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]]. They stumbled across a Hand wedding carried out by the [[Beast (Demon) (Earth-616)|Beast]], with Muramasa giving the couple their own blades. The mutant duo assaulted the wedding and killed the couple, with Solem taking the two swords, while Wolverine was snatched by the Beast. Solem offered to help Logan escape with one of the swords, in exchange for a favor, to which Logan agreed.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 13}}

During the tournament, Solem was pitted against his own teammate, War, in a challenge to see who could cut a limb off of an opponent first. Solem called in his favor with Logan, asking Saturnyne to summon him and telling War that he had just killed her son, before leaving. Logan was successful in winning the challenge, slicing off War's hand.{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 7}} Following the end of the tournament, Solemn sneaked behind Saturnyne's guards and entered one of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]'s [[Gateways]].{{r|X of Swords: Destruction Vol 1 1}}
