===Origin===
Sooraya Qadir was born in [[Afghanistan]]. As a child she was kidnapped and then sold into slavery.{{r|New X-Men: Hellions Vol 1 1}} A few years later Sooraya was rescued by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]] from a slave-trading ring.{{r|New X-Men Vol 1 133}} She was sent to the [[India]]n [[X-Corporation (Earth-616)|X-Corporation]] base in [[Mumbai]]. Sooraya hid herself from the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] who were stationed there by turning into sand and spreading herself around the complex. [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Phoenix]] sensed Sooraya's presence and telepathically convinced her to reveal herself to everyone present. Sooraya announced her presence by speaking a single word: "Turaab" ("Dust" in Arabic).{{citation}}

===[[Xavier Institute]]===
Ultimately, Dust was enrolled at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] in [[Westchester County]], [[New York (State)|New York]]. Quiet and nervous, she experienced difficulty adapting to her new surroundings - particularly after being placed into [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]]'s Special Class, which at the time was becoming increasingly radicalized as Xorn prepared to usurp [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Xavier]]. Xorn attempted to indoctrinate Sooraya, but she resisted because he demanded that she renounce her faith and embrace his vision of a world dominated by mutants, which she refused to do. She attempted to alert Xavier about Xorn's plans, but Xorn convinced the Professor that she was out of control, and thus Xavier used his powers to calm her enough so that she could be gathered into a jar. Even after being contained, the Professor could sense her panic, and shortly after, Xorn crippled him and began his destructive campaign to reverse the Earth's magnetic poles.{{citation}}

Some time later, when the school was rebuilt, Sooraya was given the loud and rebellious [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]] as a roommate. This turned out to be a disaster, as the two often came to disagreements over the traditional garb which Surge believed to be an affront to women's rights. She was also made a member of the [[Hellions Squad (Earth-616)|Hellions Training Squad]], which was often at heads with Surge's squad, the [[New Mutants Squad (Earth-616)|New Mutants]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 2|4}} 

Her discomfort with questioning [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Keller]]'s authority, even as he prepared the Hellions for an attack against the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|FBI]], further soured relations between her and Surge. When the two squads battled each other outside Salem Central Station, Surge despised her roommate so badly that she was forced to shift targets with [[Sofia Mantega (Earth-616)|Wind Dancer]] by [[Prodigy (David Alleyne)|Prodigy]]. This resulted in Sooraya being blown in her granular form all the way back to campus and had the unfortunate effect of leaving Sooraya naked when she materialized back at the Academy. Seeing how badly she had humiliated her roommate, Noriko assisted her by giving her back her clothes and decided to be more tolerant with her. Meanwhile, despite her discomfort around others, Sooraya forged a friendship with [[Joshua Guthrie (Earth-616)|Icarus]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 5}} He asked her to the school dance, but she declined since the idea of the dance made her uncomfortable, but he was not insulted.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 14}}

After the Hellions became the school's field day winners they went off to California to stay at Julian's house. On the flight Dust confided with Mercury that she hadn't seen her mother in several years since she was kidnapped and sold into slavery. She had attempted to track her mother down but due to the war it had been difficult.{{r|New X-Men: Hellions Vol 1 1}} 

The Hellions met a mutant power broker called the [[Kingmaker (Earth-616)|Kingmaker]]. He told them he could grant each of them a wish. Dust traveled to a refugee camp in Afghanistan and was able to see her mother. Her mother was glad that Sooraya was in a country where she now had a choice whether or not to wear her niqab. She told her mother that she may able to go to America with her and that she didn't think it mattered what she had to do to make it happen. The Kingmaker forced Sooraya to return to America so the Hellions would fulfill their end of the deal.{{r|New X-Men: Hellions Vol 1 2}} Upon her return to America along with the rest of the Hellions she stole a biological weapon for the Kingmaker.{{r|New X-Men: Hellions Vol 1 3}} When they realized they had been tricked they decided to take back their wishes and their contract. Sooraya was left, once again, unable to find her mother as she had been transferred from the refugee camp where she had visited her.{{r|New X-Men: Hellions Vol 1 4}}

===[[M-Day]] and [[Decimation]]===
After M-Day, which depowered over 90% of the mutant population, the population of Xavier's student body was reduced to only 27 students. The squad system was dissolved, and the remaining students were merged into one large group. Sooraya was paired as roommates with [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]].{{citation}}

Sooraya became a target of [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|William Stryker]]'s crusade against the Xavier Institute, as he expressed his need to "eliminate the Muslim." Icarus gave her a note, which X-23 told Sooraya not to trust, as Icarus "smells like death". When Icarus visited the church of William Stryker he was shown why Dust was his next target. [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] had a vision of an altered future in his memory banks which showed Dust killing all the Purifiers by turning into a sand storm and ripping the flesh from their bones. After entering the church of Reverend Stryker, she was shown being shot down, though it was revealed to be X-23 wearing one of her niqabs. When Stryker's team infiltrated the school, Dust reappeared, surprising Stryker and playing a key role in defeating his [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] after all.{{citation}}

With the help of the rest of the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]], Sooraya would later defeat Nimrod at [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]]'s [[Eagle Plaza|place]]. Given the fact that the mission was unsanctioned and caused damages in [[Dallas]], [[Texas (State)|Texas]], Sooraya Qadir was red-flagged by the O*N*E.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 33}}

Sooraya cried with Icarus's mother [[Lucinda Guthrie (Earth-616)|Lucinda Guthrie]] when she came to the Institute, and apologized for not being able to do more to save her son. His mother told her that Icarus thought she was a beautiful person (a significant statement, since he had never seen her without her veil on).{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 32}}

===In Limbo===
Dust was shown praying to Allah before being teleported with the other students to [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]] where she was held captive by [[Belasco (Earth-616)|Belasco]] and his demons. X-23 broke free and urged Dust and [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]] to join her in fighting Belasco. Dust was too afraid of the demon that she thought of as the Devil, but when X-23 was seemingly killed, Dust broke free and attacked Belasco, saying that if she was to die, she would make Allah proud.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 41}}

===[[World War Hulk]]===
Dust was one of the students to go up against the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] after his return to earth. She attacked him after he defeated [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]] but she too was defeated when Hulk pulled a water pipe up from the ground and sprayed a large amount of water on her.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men Vol 1 1}}

===[[Messiah Complex]]===
Regrouping after their failed attack under the leadership of [[Matthew Risman (Earth-616)|Matthew Risman]], the Purifiers were keeping track of the escaped [[Predator X]]. Horribly scarred by Dust's attack, Matthew fixated on training Predator X to seek out and kill Sooraya by using abayas and niqabs bearing some recognizable quality of hers (possibly her scent).{{citation}} While being trained to seek out and kill Dust, Predator X sensed the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|mutant]] it was originally created to destroy and the Purifiers followed.{{r|X-Men: Messiah Complex Vol 1 1}} Dust was crucial in the success of the battle against the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]] as she helped take out the massively powerful and dangerous [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]], by entering his body in her sand form and lacerating his lungs.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 207}}

===[[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]] & [[Eric Gitter (Earth-616)|Ink]]===
She then joined the newly-formed team of [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]] along with Rockslide, [[Nicholas Gleason (Earth-616)|Wolf Cub]], Blindfold, as well as new students [[Eric Gitter (Earth-616)|Ink]], [[Alisa Tager (Earth-616)|Cipher]] and [[Jonas Graymalkin (Earth-616)|Graymalkin]]. However, the team disbanded after it was discovered that the person who formed the team, Cyclops, was really [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]] in disguise. During this time, the false Cyclops ordered the team to capture the original [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]]. During their battle with [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]], Dust was turned to glass by Magma using extreme heat, and subsequently shattered. However, Magma was able to heat up all the broken glass, turning it into sand again and Dust returned to her human form unconscious. However, the change caused her cells to die. Dust tried to help the captured Donald Pierce escape in exchange for him finding a cure for her condition, but she subsequently changed her mind and attacked Pierce. It was her last act as she died in front of her friends. [[Eric Gitter (Earth-616)|Ink]] tried to use his Caduceus tattoo to heal Dust but she was already dead. Later, Ink used his Phoenix tattoo and was able to resurrect Dust. However, the effort caused Ink to fall into a coma.{{r|Young X-Men Vol 1 1|12}}

===[[San Francisco]] & [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]]===
Together with other mutants Dust relocated to the [[Graymalkin Industries]] in [[San Francisco]] and later to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]]. She fought alongside the X-Men during the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] of Earth.{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men #1|2}} When [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene]]'s [[Inner Circle (Selene) (Earth-616)|Inner Circle]] attacked Utopia, Sooraya was forced to fight with a former teammate [[Kevin Ford (Earth-616)|Wither]], and was heartbroken when he coolly killed [[Sidney Green (Earth-616)|Onyxx]] in front of her.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 23}} After the [[Second Coming|return]] of the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Mutant Messiah]] and subsequent attack of the [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod Sentinels]], Dust was amongst those who fought back at [[Golden Gate Bridge]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 27}}

===[[Age of X]]===
Later, during [[David Haller (Earth-616)|Legion]]'s [[Earth-11326|reality warp]], [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-11326)|Sooraya]] was a member of the [[Moonstar Cadre (Earth-11326)|Moonstar Cadre]]. Once the alteration of reality was undone, Sooraya asked Emma Frost to remove those memories, afraid of the cruelty she had displayed.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #248}}

===[[Schism (Event)|Schism]]===
After the [[Schism (Event)|Schism]] Sooraya at first wanted to go with most of her friends to the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School]] but quickly realized that Logan's team just deluded themselves, thinking that there was other choice but to spend their lives fighting for survival. She believed pretending so asked for a repeat of the [[New X-Men Vol 2 25|previous tragedy]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy #263}} She stayed with Cyclops' team on Utopia and with other former students was assigned to the Street Team to fight street crime, protecting [[San Francisco]] under the guidance of experienced X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 1}} She later assisted the [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]] in beating [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy #262|263}} Following the end of [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|war between the Avengers and the X-Men]] Sooraya joined the Jean Grey School.{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #15}}
===[[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]]===
After the destruction of the Xavier Institute and apparent death of the X-Men,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 5 10}} Sooraya found herself being harassed at an anti-mutant protest at [[Worthington Industries]]. She used her powers against some of the protesters (who she called "bigots") and, upon the arrival of the Champions to diffuse the situation, she allied herself with them.{{r|Champions Vol 3 3}}

Dust helped the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]] in a battle versus some [[Rock Trolls (Orange-Skinned)|Rock Trolls]] in [[Australia]]. During the fight [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] joined in due to his memories from his younger self of being a Champion. After the fight, Dust told Cyclops the reason she didn't answer his call, but he told her not to worry about it because it seemed that she found her place with the Champions. [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] asked Dust to join them after Cyclops vouched for her.{{r|Champions Vol 3 5}}

===[[House of X Vol 1|House of X]]===
Dust became a citizen of the new mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. She later celebrated the return of the X-Men following their victory and death against [[Mother Mold (Earth-616)|Mother Mold]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 4|5}} 

When a group of Omega Level Mutants from Krakoa and [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]] terraformed [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]] to make it a mutant colony and the capital of the Sol system, {{r|Planet-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}} they did not account for how the planet's climate would change. Dust was put in charge of controlling the sandstorms to make sure they didn't destroy any important landmarks.{{r|Way of X Vol 1 4}}

| Powers                  = [[File:Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616) from New X-Men Hellions Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sooraya]]
Dust is a [[Homo superior|mutant]].

'''Sand Form:''' Dust has the ability to convert herself into a destructive sand blast by simultaneously transforming the substance of her body into loose silicon particles and creating an explosive release at her center, expelling her sandy mass at high velocity in all directions, then causing her particles to reassemble themselves back into her human form. With apparent telepathic control, she can then move at high velocity resembling a sand storm. The sand storm effect is strong enough to destroy steel and rip the flesh from one's bones; this is helped by the microscopic edges of the sand particles acting as tiny blades. She can also enter people's lungs and scour them from the inside.

*'''''Telepathic Resistance:''''' Dust is very hard to telepathically detect or influence while in her sand-like form, even for more powerful telepaths like Professor Xavier and Jean Grey.{{r|New X-Men #133}}
*'''''Enhanced Durability:''''' Dust's skin, bone, and muscle are augmented to make it stronger and harder than human; impervious to injury to a certain extent. 
*'''''Magical Resistance:''''' Dust is very hard to magically detect or influence while in sand-like form.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 39}}

Sooraya was considered a '''General Threat''' by the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]], at the time of the [[M-Day]].{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files #1}} [[Nimrod (Earth-811)|Nimrod]] classified her as a '''Threat Level: Medium''',{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 31}} and after defeating him, she was red-flagged and allegedly reclassified by the O*N*E.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 33}}

| Abilities               = * '''Multilingual:''' Dust speaks Arabic and English fluently.
* She has shown to be a good hand-to-hand combatant.
| Strength                = Sooraya possesses the normal human strength of a woman of her age, height, and build who engages in [[Strength_Scale#Normal: able to lift one's own body weight|moderate regular exercise]].

| Weaknesses              = While in her granular form, Sooraya can be weakened by wind or water.{{r|World War Hulk: X-Men #1}} Her sand form is also vulnerable to extremes of heat, causing it to crystallize into glass, paralyzing her.{{r|Young X-Men Vol 1 3}} Like many transmorphs, she reverts to her human form if exhausted or knocked unconscious.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 6}}

| Equipment               = 
| Transportation          = Champions mobile bunker, X-Men Blackbird, Krakoan Gateways

| Notes                   = 
* Normally, Dust appears to be able to convert her clothing to granular form. However, during the fight between the Hellions and the New Mutants outside the Salem Center Station, [[Sofia Mantega (Earth-616)|Wind Dancer]] trapped her in a wind while she was in the middle of her transformation and sent her all the way back to campus before she could convert her clothing. This effectively left her naked back at campus. Ironically, Wind Dancer's intentions were good - Sooraya was being attacked by [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Noriko]] and refused to fight back.
* Dust is a devout [[:Category:Sunni Characters|Sunni]] [[:Category:Muslim Characters|Muslim]].{{r|New X-Men #146}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 22}}

| Trivia                  = * There are some similarities between Dust's powers and the powers of [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]]. Dust's typical state while using her powers, however, is that of an airborne dust storm, while Sandman typically maintains a more ground-based solid and roughly-humanoid form.
* In line with Sooraya's character as a traditional Muslim, she chooses to observe Islamic hijab by donning traditional dress. Sooraya explains to her mother that she always observes hijab because of the modesty it affords her from men, and never did it because of the [[Taliban (Earth-616)|Taliban]]'s enforcement of hijab on women. Her mother is happy that she lives somewhere where she is able to make those choices, unlike in Afghanistan.{{r|New X-Men: Hellions #2}}
** Characters in the comics refer to Dust's traditional Muslim outfit as a burqa.{{r|New X-Men #133}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 2}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 6}}{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}} Actually the outfit Dust wears is an abaya with a niqab veil for her face,{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}} an ensemble originating in and worn mostly by Muslim women in the Persian Gulf states of the Middle East, with a few slight modifications depending on the story (like a yellow waist sash added to the abaya, for example).
** [[Nezhno Abidemi (Earth-616)|Nezhno Abidemi]] was the first to get it right while correcting fellow student [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 42}}
** Even Dust,{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 2}} and her mother [[Mirah Qadir (Earth-616)|Mirah]] have called it a burqa.{{r|New X-Men: Hellions #2}}
* Dust appears in Deadpool's ending in Marvel Vs Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds. Though she's not an available character, yet appears with most characters in the game during the ending.
* During the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]'s [[Earth-58163|House of M]]-reality warp, a decidedly more secular, less reserved version of [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-58163)|Sooraya]] was a member of the [[New Mutants Leadership Institute]]. Whether this was a manifestation of her secret desires or not is unclear. After [[Decimation|M-Day]], she retained no memory of these events.
* Sooraya is a member of the [[The Forums|Forums]] social media network.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 8}}
