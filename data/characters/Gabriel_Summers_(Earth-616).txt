===Early Years===
Vulcan's history began on the Shi'ar throne-world, as the unborn child of [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|Christopher]] and Katherine Summers (parents of Scott and Alex Summers, who would become [[Cyclops]] and [[Havok]], respectively). Katherine Summers was pregnant when the Summers were abducted by [[D'ken Neramani (Earth-616)|D'Ken]]. Corsair escaped in an attempt to save both mother and child, but she was killed in retaliation by D'Ken.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #4}}

[[File:Gabriel Summers (Earth-616) from X-Men Deadly Genesis Vol 1 6 001.png|thumb|150px|left|Young Gabriel being aged through adolescence through a Shi'ar incubator]]
Gabriel was removed from his mother's body and placed in an incubation-accelerator, used to breed new slaves, aging him to the prime adolescence. Sent to Earth to become a slave for [[Davan Shakari (Earth-616)|Davan Shakari]], the Emperor's hand on Earth, he escaped to be found by [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggart]] with little or no memories of who he was or where he came from. She took him as her ward, and instructed him in the use of his nascent powers.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #4|6}}

===Vulcan the X-Man===
He claimed his name was Gabriel, but he chose the code name of Kid Vulcan from a book on Roman mythology, and [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] recognized his mental imprint as being related to Cyclops. He was one of the team, including [[Petra (Earth-616)|Petra]], [[Armando Mu√±oz (Earth-616)|Darwin]], and [[Suzanne Chan (Earth-616)|Sway]], that attempted to rescue the original [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] from [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #4}}

Vulcan and his team rescued Scott from Krakoa and Vulcan was able to hurt the living island, which greatly enraged the creature. Vulcan revealed to Cyclops that they were in fact brothers, and sent Cyclops away on their jet to safety. As the jet took off, Cyclops watched in horror as the living island struck down and, seemingly, killed Vulcan and his team. Sway was hit first, and severed in two at her torso. Her body released the last of her mutant power to slow time down around them. As Petra was incinerated, she also reacted reflexively and drew them all below the surface into a cave that her power created. There, Vulcan and Darwin lay dying, and Darwin transformed himself into energy and bonded with Vulcan, thus saving them both.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #6}}

After the apparent deaths of the team, Cyclops returned to Professor Xavier in a hysterical state, blaming himself for their deaths. The Professor decided it was best for all involved if he altered their memories to forget about Vulcan and his team, and spare everyone the agony. A new team was assembled to rescue the original X-Men from Krakoa.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #4}}{{r|Giant-Size X-Men #1}}

Vulcan and Darwin were launched into space along with the Krakoa land mass by [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]]{{r|Giant-Size X-Men #1}} and remained inert until years later, when the massive backlash of power resulting from [[M-Day]] awakened Vulcan.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #1}}

[[File:X-Men Deadly Genesis Vol 1 5 Textless.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Vulcan meeting his brother, [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], after his return]]
===Deadly Genesis===
He returned from his space exile to reclaim his title as an X-Man, killing [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]] in the process, and attempting to kill [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], even kidnapping [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Marvel Girl]] and [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]].{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #1|3}}

After Xavier's deception had been exposed, Marvel Girl reached into Vulcan's mind and released the subconscious inert form of Darwin, which Vulcan expelled from his body. Using this opportunity, the X-Men attacked him as they deemed him too dangerous to be left alone. Vulcan easily repelled their attack and fled the planet, renouncing Cyclops as his brother, and headed for space with the vision of D'Ken killing his mother raging in his mind, bent on revenge.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #6}}

===The Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire===
On his way to the Shi'ar galaxy he learned that D'Ken had been in a coma and was no longer the ruler of the Shi'ar. He re-focused his anger on the then current ruler: [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Lilandra]]. He captured a Shi'ar war-bird and its crew and learned of Lilandra's sister [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]], who was in exile. As he made his way towards the Shi'ar galaxy, he destroyed the star-gates behind him to hinder the X-Men he knew would be coming, which brought him to the attention of the Shi'ar [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #477}}

[[Impulse (Imperial Guard)|Impulse]] was killed and several other members were seriously injured during the battle. Gabriel was ultimately defeated by [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]], losing his left eye as a result. Under [[K'Tor (Earth-616)|K'Tor's]] orders he was taken to the prison orbiting [[Phygim]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #480}}
 
[[File:Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 483 Textless.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Vulcan and [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]]]] 

After spending an unknown amount of time in the prison, Gabriel was released by a "Secret Order" of Shi'ar. They seemed to want Vulcan's help in 'restoring the true empire', and took him to meet the also imprisoned Deathbird. However, soon afterwards, Deathbird managed to convince him to at least delay his plan for vengeance, after the two became romantically involved. Vulcan used his powers to heal D'Ken's injuries. Afterwards, a grateful D'Ken asked Vulcan to marry Deathbird.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #483}}

After his wedding Vulcan threw Professor Xavier into the [[M'kraan Crystal]] (which restored his powers), killed D'Ken, and named himself emperor of the Shi'ar. In the midst of a battle between the Shi'ar troops loyal to Lilandra (with Corsair's [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]] and X-Men) and Shi'ar troops loyal to D'Ken, Corsair was killed by Vulcan when Corsair commanded Vulcan, as his father, to stop the senseless violence.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #484|486}}

===Emperor Vulcan===
The civil war between Vulcan's forces and those loyal to the deposed Lilandra continued to rage on. Led by Havok and the Starjammers, Lilandra's forces gradually whittled away at Vulcan's, which were plagued by defections. The Shi'ar, contrary to Vulcan's expectations, were not happy to have an outsider as their ruler. Vulcan was discouraged by this, but Deathbird convinced him that they would come to accept him.{{r|X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #1}}

Warned in advance of a rebel raid on Feather's Edge, Vulcan and his fleet ambushed the Starjammers. However, in the middle of the battle, his ship, the Hammer, was destroyed by the [[M'Kraan (Race)|Scy'ar Tal]] (translating as "Death to the Shi'ar"). Vulcan and Gladiator attacked the leader of the Scy'ar Tal and were easily defeated, whereupon they retreated deeper into Shi'ar space.{{r|X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #1|2}}

Marvel Girl made contact with the Eldest Scy'ar Tal and discovered their true origin. The Scy'ar Tal were originally called the M'Kraan. Early in their history, the Shi'ar attacked them, killed a great number of their people, making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shi'ar settled on their planet, took the M'Kraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the M'Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities, [[Sharra (Earth-616)|Sharra]] & [[K'ythri (Earth-616)|K'ythri]]. The M'Kraan then changed their named to Scy'ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi'ar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feather's Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After which, Vulcan made contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire.{{r|X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #2}}

Under the ceasefire, the Shi'ar and the Starjammers decided to take out the Finality, thus crippling the Scy'ar's biggest threat. Once Havok and Vulcan were in position to destroy Finality, the Eldest Scy'ar tries to stop them. Once Vulcan figured out how the Eldest was powered, he severed the connection Eldest had with his brothers, making him powerless. Once the connection was severed, the Scy'ar became unorganized, and the tide of the battle shifted to the Shi'ar. The Shi'ar then proceeded to attack both the Scy'ar and the Starjammers. Meanwhile, Vulcan blasted Havok into a sun.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Emperor Vulcan Vol 1 3}}-[[X-Men: Emperor Vulcan Vol 1 4|4]]}}

Vulcan decided to use Finality to destroy the Scy'ar by using the weapon to place a star in the middle of their fleet. Alex returned and, having absorbed enough power to burn him, decided to end things with Vulcan. While they battled, Rachel and Korvus tried but fail to stop the beacon that would initiate the attack by the Shi'ar. The Shi'ar Imperial Guard ended Alex's battle with Vulcan by appearing with the Starjammers in captivity, threatening to kill them. Before surrendering, Alex destroyed Finality. With Alex and the Starjammers in custody Vulcan declared that he would return the Shi'ar Empire to its former glory.{{r|X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #5}}

===War of Kings===
Vulcan began an aggressive war of conquest to expand the Shi'ar Empire, occupying, among other races, the [[Z'nox (Race)|Z'nox]]. All the while, he became obsessed with making Havok acknowledge his superiority, which Havok refused to do. The Starjammers escaped their prison, nearly killing Vulcan in the process, and severely wounding Deathbird, but were forced to flee to the [[Kree]] Imperium.{{r|{{cl|X-Men: Kingbreaker Vol 1 1}}-[[X-Men: Kingbreaker Vol 1 4|4]]}}

Vulcan launched a surprise attack on the Kree, now ruled by [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] and the [[Inhumans]]. The Imperial Guard retrieved Lilandra, who Vulcan planned to execute. However, he was stopped by one of his admirals, stating that by doing so would only make her a martyr and incite factions loyal to her to overthrow him around a similar figurehead. Gabriel then abducted and attacked [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]]. Soon enough, Lilandra was assassinated in an attempt to usurp Vulcan. Immediately, a civil war ignited in the Imperium between factions loyal to her and Vulcan. Though advised by the Fraternity of Raptors and his admirals to sue for peace and return to their planets to restore order, Vulcan refused to listen and flew off to engage the Inhumans. He found Black Bolt, with his T-Bomb. Believing the Inhuman intended to destroy his empire, Vulcan engaged the silent king. They both disappeared in the resulting explosion that tore a hole in the fabric of space and time.{{r|War of Kings #6}}

[[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]] took Vulcan's place as Majestor of the Shi'ar in order to prevent another civil war.{{r|War of Kings: Who Will Rule? #1}} His wife was later abducted by the [[Providian Order (Earth-616)|Providian]], as she was pregnant with their [[Deathbird's Child (Earth-616)|child]], a mutant/Shi'ar hybrid with great potential.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 #18|21}}

While floating through the fault, Vulcan was pulled away by tentacles, into the mouth of a giant alien head. While inside, he was vivisected by three aliens who wanted to study and see if he would be useful. They wanted Black Bolt and him to carry out their secretive plans, but since Black Bolt escaped their reach, they settled on just using Vulcan. While opening him up, they discovered a great fire within him, but deemed his body and mind to be too twisted and broken to fix, yet still useful to them. 

Later on they let him go back into his universe, with him believing himself to be healthy and whole. A changed man with a whole new and different personality and outlook on life. While trapping his usual persona deep within his mind, only to be unleashed through great emotional turmoil or when they deemed fit to their mysterious plans.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 10}} 

===Krakoa===
Vulcan eventually resurfaced in the mutant-nation of Krakoa, and established residence in the [[Summer House]], a Krakoan habitat on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], albeit with a vastly different attitude and demeanor than he had before. Gabriel lived with his two brothers [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] and Cyclops, his niece and nephew [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] and [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Prestige]], his sister-in-law Jean Grey-Summers, as well as Wolverine. Gabriel had the habit of bringing various "acquaintances" with him from time-to-time (among them the resurrected [[Suzanne Chan (Earth-616)|Sway]] and [[Petra (Earth-616)|Petra]]) from the mainland.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 1}} During this time, Gabriel experienced a nightmare about the [[Fault]], which was connected to a looming Brood invasion on Krakoa over a Brood's King Egg that [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Rahne Sinclair]] had brought back to the mutant island.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 8}}

===Empyre===
Vulcan started to have even more visions of his time in the Fault, and of the interdimensional aliens. After multiple nights of partying and drinking with Sway and Petra, in the Summer house on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] he tried to shrug off these visions with margaritas with his friends. He decided to take a walk to discover what they meant. While walking, he discovered and greeted a small [[Cotati]] [[Empyre]] outpost while they were plotting to fire upon the Earth. He showed them kindness and preached non-violence against the Earth, especially [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], but understood why they would want the destroy the rest of the world, due to the humans living on it. While trying to remain peaceful after they were trying to kill him, Vulcans original persona was unleashed causing great destruction to the small outpost, killing everyone there, except one that would perish after mentioning to his fellow soldiers a single word repeatedly: "Krakoa".{{r|X-Men Vol 5 10}}

Vulcan was present in the final battle in Otherworld between [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-men]] and [[Swordbearers of Krakoa (Earth-616)| the Swordbearers of Krakoa]] against [[Swordbearers of Arakko (Earth-616)|the Swordbearers of Arakko]], the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|first horsemen of Apocalypse]], the forces of [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]], the [[Amenth|Amenthian]] [[Demons|Daemons]], and the [[Summoners (Earth-616)|Summoners]].{{r|X of Swords: Destruction Vol 1 1}}

He along with many other Omega-Level Mutants later used their powers to terraform [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]] to create a new home for Arakko.{{r|Planet-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Magus (Earth-7528) and Gabriel Summers (Earth-616) from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 14 001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Warlock's statement]]
Vulcan is an [[Mutant Power Level Classification#Omega Level Mutants|'''Omega level mutant''']].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 14}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #480}}{{r|House of X #1}} He also is described to be ''"at least Omega Level"'' by [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]],{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #1}} ''"[[Mutant Power Level Classification#Beyond Omega|past Omega]]"'' by [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]],{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #6}} and ''"way past Omega"'' by [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]],{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #4}} after being exposed to bursts of mutant energy. It was stated that the burst of mutant energy elevated him to '''Omega-Level'''.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #477}} Now confirmed by Charles Xavier to be an Omega-Level mutant.{{r|House of X #1}}{{r|X-Men Vol 5 10}}

Thus far, he has displayed the following abilities: 

'''Energy Manipulation:''' Vulcan can psionically manipulate, control, and absorb vast amounts of energy as he sees fit. He can project radiation along the electromagnetic spectrum and even manipulate some exotic variants such as Cyclops optic blasts or Adam Warlock's magical energies. 

*'''Energy Absorption:''' Vulcan could absorb virtually any type of energy and channel that energy through his blasts. It is unknown if Vulcan could absorb energy to achieve other effects to increase his strength, physiology, or the like. His energy absorption ability and his ability to wield energy had their limits. For example, his brother Havok was capable of easily overpowering him with his raw power and had him at his mercy after Vulcan threw him into a Sun. He described himself as a "'''High Order Energy Manipulator'''"{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 14}} and an "'''Omega-Level Energy Manipulator'''".{{r|War of Kings #6}}

*'''Energy Blasts:''' Vulcan could generate light, heat, force, electricity, and other forms of energy and project them in the form of powerful energy blasts. He could generate these blasts from his hands as well as his eyes.

*'''Flight:''' Vulcan was able to fly and levitate using his powers. He was capable of interstellar flight (adding more energy to become increasingly fast, presumably sub-light).{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 477}}

*'''Solid Energy Constructs/Simulated Telekinesis:''' Vulcan could solidify his energy into force-fields and other shapes. The effect of his energy constructs could be used to simulate a form of telekinesis by lifting and moving objects.

*'''Power Suppression:''' Vulcan could apparently use his powers to override those of another person's mutagenic aura by manipulating the electrical current of their brain, making them temporarily unable to use them.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #2}}

*'''Energy Detection:''' Vulcan was capable of detecting energy signatures from great distances when the power in question was potent. This included other mutants with energy powers usually at lesser ranges and starships at far greater rangers based on their star engines.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 477}}

*'''Energy Self-Sustenance:''' He also appeared capable of breathing in space as well as speaking by transmitting his voice as pure energy, though this ability seemed to be limited. If he didn't rest or find power other than his own, his reserve would leave him seemingly scarce until he did.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 477}}

*'''Healing:''' Also shown capable of healing from seemingly mortal injuries by manipulating his body's energy composition.{{r|War of Kings #6}} The full extent and speed of Vulcan's capacity to heal isn't known. The term healing is used in lieu of regeneration as Vulcan did not regenerate his eye or heal the scar inflicted on him by [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]].

'''Power Siphoning:''' Vulcan demonstrated the ability to siphon his opponents' powers. Vulcan was able to siphon Marvel Girl's power of telepathically accessing the psychic remnants of events that certain places held while he was suppressing her powers, it unknown whether or not he can siphon someones powers when that person is still able to access them. It is not known whether Vulcan permanently kept these powers or not, but it's unlikely.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #3}}

'''Psionic Resistance:''' Vulcan proved highly resistant to psionic attacks. The only such attack to be successful was performed by [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Marvel Girl]] after he had already lowered his defense in order to show the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] his memories of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #6}} In most cases he is able to use a telepath's own psionic energy to protect himself from the same.

Darwin, after merging with the remains of their two friends, converted himself to energy, keeping Vulcan alive. While Darwin was present in his body, Vulcan was able to simulate his teammates' powers.{{r|X-Men: Deadly Genesis #6}}

'''Geokinesis:''' The ability to manipulate large land masses of earth.

'''Chronokinesis:''' The ability to slow down or even stop time itself and view past occurrences in ghostly images.
