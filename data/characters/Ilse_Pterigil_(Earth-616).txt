| History                 = The [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] encountered a being called the Star-Thief, who was responsible for making the stars disappear. The [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] deduced that the reason the Star-Thief has only been stealing stars and not entire galaxies must be because he came from a planet in a large interstellar dust cloud, where other galaxies are not visible. Finding a planetary system in such a cloud, the Defenders and aliens headed there, but an interstellar fleet intercepted them. The Star-Thief appeared and tried to destroy the Defenders, but [[Cloud (Earth-616)|Cloud]] absorbed its star bolt and realized that it cannot use its full power because they are close to Star-Thief's home, where its real body was. Star-Thief fled, and Cloud was able to track its energy. The Defenders made their way through a major city to its largest building, where the planet's Queen resided. The Queen's daughter, the Princess, has been in a coma ever since she was struck in the eyes by a laser beam. The Defenders realized that the Princess was the Star-Thief, who has been subconsciously making the stars disappear because their light reminded her of the laser that blinded her and made her afraid.{{r|Defenders #150}}
