| History                 = 
Cytorrak is an immensely powerful entity described as being both a god and a demon. Cytorrak was at one time worshiped on Earth until he was banished to the [[Crimson Cosmos]] due to unrevealed circumstances.{{r|New Excalibur #14}}

===Octessence===
1,000 years ago, Cyttorak participated in the [[Octessence (Earth-616)|Wager of the Octessence]], a contest between himself, [[Watoomb (Earth-616)|Watoom]], [[Valtorr (Earth-616)|Valtorr]], [[Balthakk (Earth-616)|Balthakk]], [[Farallah (Earth-616)|Farallah]], [[Ikonn (Earth-616)|Ikonn]], [[Krakkan (Earth-616)|Krakkan]], and [[Raggadorr (Earth-616)|Raggadorr]], to determine which of them was the most powerful. Each being would use a magical artifact to create avatars out of the first human to touch it. Once one human had been transformed, others would be drawn to the remaining artifacts. These humans, called [[Exemplars (Earth-616)|Exemplars]], would conquer humanity and fight each other to the death until only one was left standing. Whoever's avatar was left standing would be the winner. Cyttorak created the [[Crimson Gem of Cyttorak|Crimson Gem]] as his artifact and placed it in his [[Temple of Cyttorak (Korea)|temple]] in what would one day become [[Korea]], guarded by a demon called [[Xorak (Earth-616)|Xorak]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 22}} Centuries ago, an order of monks attempted to summon Cyttorak to Earth but mistakenly summoned his destructive aspect instead. A pair of rival sorcerers, [[Gomurr (Earth-616)|Gomurr]] and [[Tar (Earth-616)|Tar]], succeeded in sealing this aspect within the Crimson Gem.{{r|X-Men Unlimited #12}}

===Juggernaut===
Cyttorak would occasionally send the Crimson Gem into the outside world, transforming any who came into contact with it into the [[Juggernaut]]. It is believed that due to Gomurr and Tar's manipulation of the Gem, other Exemplars were not created.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #1}}

[[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] and his step-brother [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Cain Marko]] were serving in Korea during a police action. Marko fled enemy shelling  and hid in a cave. Xavier, not wanting to see his step-brother jailed for desertion, went after him. Once inside, Marko found the Crimson Gem. The educated Xavier recognized the cave as the Temple of Cyttorak and warned Marko not to touch it. However, Marko disobeyed and grabbed the gem, transforming him into the Juggernaut.{{r|X-Men #12}}
<!-- 
===[[War of the Seven Spheres]]===
Cyttorak was one of many beings who tried to recruit [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]].{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #48|49}} 
-->
===[[Fear Itself]]===
[[File:Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 543 001.jpg|thumb|right|There's a new Juggernaut in town]]
When the Juggernaut was transformed into [[Kuurth]], Cyttorak believed he finally started acting as Cyttorak had always wished him to. However, Kuurth served the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]], not Cyttorak. [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] revealed this to the crimson being, who became enraged, and offered him to chose a new avatar, so Cyttorak took his power back from Marko. Magik intended to become the new avatar herself, but [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] intercepted, becoming the new Juggernaut instead, much to the displeasure of [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]], Piotr's girlfriend at the time.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #541|543}}

===Favorite Avatar===
After becoming the host of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]], Colossus asked Cyttorak to release him just as he did with [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Cain]] when he began serving another. Cyttorak refused, stating that Colossus was his favorite avatar in over thousands of years because he engaged in destructive battles constantly, while Cain, as a villain, would spend most of his time hiding from heroes and only provided short bursts of destruction and stated that the Phoenix Force itself is a force of destruction which makes their goals similar to one another. Cyttorak then gave his blessing to his avatar to keep doing what he does. Colossus tried to force Cyttorak to release him by using the Phoenix Force, but Cyttorak stated that within their own realms demon lords were outside of the natural order, and merely returned Colossus to Earth.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 15}}

===The Once and Future Juggernaut===
Colossus was eventually freed from Cyttorak's influence by his sister [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik.]]{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 20}} It wasn't long before Cyttorak sent his [[Crimson Gem of Cyttorak|gem]] back to Earth where it appeared in a [[Temple of Cyttorak (Korea)|temple]] in Thailand dedicated to Cyttorak.{{r|Amazing X-Men Vol 2 15}} The gem drew various people to claim its power, including Cyttorak's former avatars Cain Marko and Colossus. The X-Men went to the temple to prevent this from happening. However, they were unable to prevent the [[Ahmet Abdol (Earth-616)|Living Monolith]] from claiming the gem and becoming the new Juggernaut.{{r|Amazing X-Men Vol 2 16|17}} Needing to stop the Monolith, Colossus met with Cyttorak and tried to coerce him into giving him enough power to kill Cyttorak himself so they could fight to the death. Instead, Cyttorak chose to make Marko the Juggernaut once again and give him even more power than before.{{r|Amazing X-Men Vol 2 18}}
