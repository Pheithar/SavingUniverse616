He was present during the trial of the [[Phineas Mason (Earth-616)|Tinkerer]],{{r|Sensational She-Hulk Vol 1 59}} and attacked by [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]] while looking for information in a bar.{{r|Daughters of the Dragon Vol 1 3}} During the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], Porcupine was captured by [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|MACH IV]] and coerced into joining the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]],{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 104}} and later fought with them against a mob of normal people empowered by the [[Well of All Things|Universal Wellspring]].{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 107}}

During [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]'s [[Doomwar (Event)|war]] with [[Wakanda]] over their [[Vibranium]] supply, Gocking was employed by the [[Walter Declun (Earth-616)|Broker]] in [[Mexico]] to secure one of Doom's outposts.{{r|Doomwar Vol 1 5}} He defended it from the [[Dora Milaje (Earth-616)|Dora Milaje]] and [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|Doomwar Vol 1 6}} Gocking then became a target of the [[Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616)|Scourge]].{{r|Captain America Vol 6 11}} While working at a [[Baltimore]] [[Inner Harbor|shipyard]] under the assumed name of Roger Manning, he left his workplace as [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] arrived and knocked him out of the way of stray bullets.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 13}} Steve told Roger to hide deeper inside the dock while he went to face the Scourge.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 14}}

Porcupine next joined the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]],{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 2}} but later attended a support group called [[Villains Anonymous (Earth-616)|Villains Anonymous]] that was held at a church and also attended by [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]], [[Hippo (Earth-616)|Hippo]], [[Maxwell Markham (Earth-616)|Grizzly]], [[Lester Verde (Earth-616)|Doctor Bong]], [[Norton Fester (Earth-616)|Looter]], [[Desmond Charne (Earth-616)|Mirage]], and others.{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man Vol 1 3}} At another Supervillains Anonymous meeting, Grizzly and Looter talked about their run-ins with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man Vol 1 11}}

Some time later, Gocking was forced to commit crimes for [[Cat (Moon's Hollow) (Earth-616)|Cat]],{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 5 5}} as she had abducted his wife, [[Olivia Gocking (Earth-616)|Olivia]], and their daughter, [[Kalie Gocking (Earth-616)|Kalie]]{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 5 6}} When [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]] went to rescue them, they were living in [[Moon's Hollow]], a small community of the families of henchmen and minor supervillains who wanted out of that life.{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 5 7}} Jess defeated Cat, who herself was the wife of a heavily abusive supervillain engineer, and promised not to involve the authorities if they stopped blackmailing their supervillain husbands.{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 5 8}} Roger, thanking Jess, asked to be her sidekick to turn over a new leaf and be a better father to his baby girl.{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 5 9}}

During Jess' pregnancy, Roger had been doing her superheroing against other villains, despite Jess' repeated endeavors to help him out, and his repeated reminders of her pregnancy limiting her hero activities. In her last month of pregnancy, when dealing with [[John Horton (Earth-616)|Griffin]], [[Thursday Rubinstein (Earth-616)|Ruby Thursday]], [[Gibbon (Hobgoblin) (Earth-616)|Gibbon]], and [[Frances Barrison (Earth-616)|Shriek]], Roger bested the criminals and readied them for arrest by the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]]; Jess gave him a "passing grade" for his performance. Shortly after, he gave Jess his best wishes as she went on maternity leave.{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 6 1}} After Jess' return from the maternity ward, Roger babysat [[Gerald Drew (Earth-616)|Gerry]] during her first night to herself; only for Jess to return early, afraid something had gone horribly wrong. As Jess opened up about the feelings she had since becoming a mother, Roger shared his experience as a father, and gave assurances that things would improve.{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 6 5}}

Porcupine was approached by Hobgoblin in order to collect his dues for the armor, only to learn from Roger that he had gone straight. Hobgoblin did not take that info lightly and had the other franchisees beat him up and strip him of the armor, then toss a [[Pumpkin Bomb]] at him; which [[Benjamin Urich (Earth-616)|Ben Urich]] witnessed from his hiding spot within a nearby vent.{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 6 14}} Jess believed Roger was dead and went on the warpath, although Roger had survived, having worn Jess' alien maternity protection shirt as under armor, having the foresight not to trust Hobgoblin. Immediately after surviving, Roger shaved his beard and used an old cash reserve to follow Jess from afar in case she needed backup. After saving Jess from an ambush, he explained his situation, to which a relieved Jess then kissed him. Their moment was cut short as Kinsley returned to snare Roger with his [[Goblin Glider|Demonic Glider]] and drag him away.{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 6 15}}

As Hobgoblin was about to throw Roger into a fire pit, Jess raced over in time to rescue him by crashing Hobgoblin and herself into a nearby junkyard. As Hobgoblin made another escape, Jess hijacked [[Ringer (Hobgoblin) (Earth-616)|Ringer]]'s glider to pursue while Roger cut his snare and unbalanced Hobgoblin for Jess to ram him mid-flight. Finally together, Jess and Roger prepared to fight Hobgoblin and his men, until [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol]] arrived, having been called by Ben about her predicament, and chased away his men. Upon her arrival, Roger and Jess kissed, despite Carol's awkward request to renew their friendship.{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 6 16}} Going home, Roger helped Jess set up for a party, but upon checking on Gerry inside, Roger found the infant playing with his inherited spider-powers. Roger chased him around the apartment, then chased Gerry up the outer wall to the party. There, as Gerry eluded numerous heroes, Roger dove off the building to catch a falling Gerry, saved by Spider-Man's timely webbing. Now accepted by her peers, Roger helped Jess clean up her apartment, and had a private party with her, Carol, and Ben.{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 6 16}}

Roger was planning to propose to Jess but reconsidered upon realizing that she was distracted by super heroics. Concluding she was neglecting their relationship,{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 7 11}} Roger ultimately broke up with Jessica and left her, but still kept available in case she needed help with Gerry.{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 7 12}}
