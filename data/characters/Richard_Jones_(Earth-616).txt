[[File:Richard Jones (Earth-616) from Captain Marvel Vol 5 19 001.jpg|thumb|left|Rick in human form.]]
'''Richard "Rick" Jones''' was orphaned at a young age, and after being expelled from several orphanages for disciplinary reasons he was placed into a state institution called Tempest Town. A troubled and rebellious youth, Jones soon came to the attention of the institution's chief administrator who smashed his guitar, a gift from his late father, and then had him severely thrashed. Soon afterward, Jones ran away from the institution. He spent the first half of his teens drifting from town to town throughout the Southwest, trying to avoid the authorities, and doing menial work when he could get it.

At the age of 16, he got his driver's license and managed to save enough money to buy a used car. Overhearing [[Gary Swanson (Earth-616)|a teen]] dare a friend to ride out with him on the desert where it was rumored an atomic bomb was going to be tested, Jones offered to take him up on the challenge. He drove his car out to the test site to discover his challenger was too timid to show up. [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Dr. Robert Bruce Banner]], designer of the [[Gamma Bomb]] to be tested, learned that someone had ventured onto the test site, and believing the countdown had been delayed, ran out into the desert to warn him back. Banner managed to throw Jones into a protective trench before the bomb detonated, but he himself was bombarded with gamma radiation. This radiation triggered a mutagenic change in Banner, causing him to turn into the raging superhuman Hulk.{{r|Incredible Hulk #1}} Feeling responsible for Banner's condition and being the only person to know that the rampaging brute was actually Banner, Jones became the Hulk's sometimes unwanted companion and ally. Jones soon organized the [[Teen Brigade (Earth-616)|Teen Brigade]], a group of young amateur ham radio enthusiasts to help him monitor the Hulk's activities.{{r|Incredible Hulk #6}} Jones was present during the Hulk's first encounters with the army, as well as superhuman menaces as the [[Yuri Topolov (Earth-616)|Gargoyle]],{{r|Incredible Hulk #1}} the alien [[Tribbitites|Toadmen]],{{r|Incredible Hulk #2}} the [[Maynard Tiboldt (Earth-616)|Ringmaster]],{{r|Incredible Hulk #3}} [[Romulus Augustulus (Earth-616)|Tyrannus]],{{r|Incredible Hulk #5}} and the [[Molyb (Earth-616)|Metal Master]],{{r|Incredible Hulk #6}} and even a run-in with the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|Fantastic Four #12}}

===The Avengers===
The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] formed due to Rick's radio broadcast warning about the Hulk.{{r|Avengers #1}} He temporarily became a sidekick for [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. His resemblance to [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky]] was noted,{{r|Avengers #4}} Rick even wore Bucky's costume for a time. However, Captain America felt he did not want to lose another partner and that while Rick was a good athlete, he was not quite up to the level Bucky was. When [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] suggested that Rick be made a full member of the Avengers, Cap strongly opposed the idea.{{r|Avengers #10}}

===Travels With Marvel===
The [[Kree]] hero [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Mar-Vell]] was bonded to Rick due to only being able to function out of the [[Negative Zone]] for a few hours.{{r|Captain Marvel #17}} Using the Negative Zone portal in the [[Baxter Building]] however, allowed Mar-Vell to co-exist with Rick on Earth once again.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 89}} Almost immediately afterward, war broke out between the Kree and Skrull Empires; this war directly involved the Avengers. Eventually, the Supreme Intelligence arranged for Rick to be brought before it and awakened his latent psionic powers. Jones used them to paralyze the entire Skrull Space Fleet as well as Ronan and his forces, thereby ending the "[[Kree-Skrull War]]" and allowing the Supreme Intelligence to return to power. The Supreme Intelligence then robbed Jones of his power, leaving the young man exhausted and lying on the point of death. As the Supreme Intelligence had planned, Mar-Vell had to be linked with Jones, in the same manner as before, so that his own life force would restore Jones to health.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 96|97}}

Rick received one of the Nega-Bands and gained similar powers to Captain Marvel{{r|Captain Marvel #41}}.As it turned out, this was a plot by the Supreme Intelligence so that Jones and Mar-Vell had to share the power of the Nega-Bands. As the Supremor, challenged them in battle at the same time, intending to defeat them in time for their minds being ravaged by the Millenia Bloom, leaving them mindless soldiers which the intelligence would use to destroy Earth and absorb Jones' potential. He was defeated when Jones activated the Intelligence's ship's weapons systems to cause a solar flare from Hala. The Intelligence was forced to divert all of its energy into the planetary shields, leaving it and all of the Kree powerless and unconscious.{{r|Captain Marvel #46}}

On their way back to Earth, they passed too close to a black hole, merging them and trapping Jones in the Negative Zone once more.{{r|Captain Marvel #47}} After returning to Earth Jones pursued his music career, appearing as a musical guest on ''Saturday Night Live''.{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 1 74}}

===Later Adventures===
After Mar-Vell's death, Rick began to team with the Hulk again. An attempt to cure the Hulk instead gave Rick radiation poisoning. In the hospital, the [[Dire Wraiths]] began to replace the staff, but were stopped by [[Rom (Earth-616)|Rom]]. Rick assisted Rom against the Wraiths, and temporarily lived with [[Brandy Clark (Earth-616)|Brandy Clark]]. Jones was cured by the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] at the same time Rom and Brandy left for [[Galador]].{{Citation}}

Rick soon began dating [[Marlo Chandler (Earth-616)|Marlo Chandler]], a former girlfriend of the Hulk's. The two later married with a great number of heroes in attendance. The [[Impossible Man (Earth-616)|Impossible Man]] did his best to usurp the proceedings by inviting the Kree, [[Skrulls]], even [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] to the ceremony. After a period of estrangement that also involved [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]] and [[Death (Earth-616)|Death]] becoming involved with Marlo, the two reunited.{{Citation}}

===Bonding with Genis-Vell===
Jones was temporarily paralyzed while Hulk was the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horseman]] War. In an attempt to stop this 'War Hulk' he was thrown against a pyramid. Rick was cured during the Destiny War, summoning Avengers from various realities to battle for their very existence against the [[Time-Keepers]]. The strain was incredible, and a future version of Genis-Vell bonded to him, much like Rick had with Mar-Vell.{{r|{{cl|Avengers: Forever Vol 1 1}}-[[Avengers: Forever Vol 1 12|12]]}} Rick and [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Genis]] later discovered this bond still applied to the current Genis.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 4 0}}

For a time Rick was trapped in the [[Microverse]] as an insane [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] ran amok throughout the universe, in the Microverse Rick met the cosmic beings [[Epiphany (Earth-616)|Epiphany]] and her brother [[Entropy (Earth-616)|Entropy]] who were behind Captain Marvels insanity{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 1|5}} and who helped him in destroying and then remaking the universe despite Rick trying to use a new skill to induce pain in Genis through their psychic link to stop him, something which he risks brain damage from if he does it too often or with too much force.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 7}} Genis preserved Rick as a molecularly dispersed being after ending the universe, Rick was able to convince Entropy to remake the universe which returned Rick to the Microverse while Genis began to become even more insane than he was before.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 6}}

Genis allowed Rick to return to Earth to speak at the trial of [[Karl Coven (Earth-616)|Karl Coven]] a deranged serial killer and to attend his execution where Coven returned to life after his lethal injection and was released and then tried to murder Rick.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 9}}

Rick returned to the Microverse to escape Coven where his injuries were treated by a group referring to themselves as being 'Jonesys',{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 10}} huge fans of Rick's music which he played across the Microverse while he was stranded there with [[Epiphany (Earth-616)|Epiphany]]. 

Due to an agreement with Genis, Jones and he would switch places every 24 hours and met [[Lucy Harper (Earth-616)|Lucy Harper]] the wife of one of Coven's victims who wanted Rick to help her kill him which Rick wouldn't do. Lucy was abducted by Coven and Genis wouldn't help her so Rick had to save her and then threaten Genis to get him to help which he did by removing Coven's powers, Coven was able to tap back into them after Rick shot him in the crotch. Coven's powers were removed again shortly after and he was killed{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 11|12}}

Genis became capable of influencing Rick's mind so that Rick wouldn't be as bothered by what Genis was doing and would even agree with him.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 13|15}} Due to Genis' recreation of the universe and powers Rick came face to face with himself as a teenager and himself years later while operating as [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America's]] sidekick wearing [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky's]] old uniform. Rick was offered the chance to change the outcome of his life but decided against it.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 14}}

Genis then revealed he had full control of Rick through their psychic link and could force Rick to do whatever he wanted without Rick realizing or caring, including killing himself.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 15}} Genis quickly began to miss Rick as he felt it was easier to feel superior with him around so he brought him back to life at Rick's funeral moments before his body was going to be burned by his fans on a funeral pyre.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 16}} Shortly after this Genis regained his sanity and was congratulated by Rick.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 18}}

Still molecularly bonded to Genis, Rick recorded a song on [[Titan (Moon of Saturn)|Titan]] for Marlo whom he hoped to win back, Genis broadcast the song across Earth and even set up a website where people could purchase it which made Rick millions. Rick then met with Genis' sister [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-616)|Phyla-Vell]] who told them that no one was going to come to Genis for his help as Captain Marvel as they were all afraid of him. In the office Rick was attacked by a superpowered future version of [[Marlo Chandler (Earth-98120)|Marlo Chandler]] who quickly disintegrated. Rick then begged Genis to save her before that became Marlo's future.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 19}}

Captain Marvel defeated alien forces plaguing the Earth of a future world, continuing to travel further into the future he questioned the son of his future self [[Ely-Vell (Earth-98120)|Ely-Vell]] for information about Marlo, he then switched places with Rick Jones who did some questioning of his own. Ely revealed some new powers however, and seemingly destroyed Rick Jones and took his [[Nega-Bands]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 21|22}}

Rick Jones had in fact not been killed by Ely but instead launched into the future and still maintained his connection to Captain Marvel. Ely was revealed to be working for Magus together with the future Marlo. Captain Marvel directed Rick Jones to the location of his Nega-Bands, and Rick Jones arrived to find Ely and Marlo. Ely gave Jones his Nega-Bands back and forcibly summoned Captain Marvel before attacking him by using [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-616)|Phyla-Vell's]] Nega-Bands.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 23|24}}

[[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]] lied to Rick about the nature of her relationship with Marlo, claiming that the [[Magus (Earth-7528)|Magus]] was responsible through psychic manipulation so that Rick and Marlo could get back together without feeling guilty. While he and Marlo are attempting to 'celebrate' their reunion the cosmic beings [[Eulogy (Earth-616)|Eulogy]] and [[Expediency (Earth-616)|Expediency]] arrive and separate Rick from Genis while breaking the 4th wall.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 25}}

===Separated from Genis===
Jones authored a best-selling autobiographical novel on his personal history with superhumans such as the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Avengers (Earth-616)|The Avengers]] with a focus on his days as a sidekick, the novel was titled 'Sidekick'.{{r|Alias Vol 1 7}} After the book was published there was [[Richard Jones (Impersonator) (Earth-616)|a man]] impersonating Jones and attempting to make it as a musician.{{r|Alias Vol 1 7|9}} 

Rick invested the royalties he earned from the publishing of 'Sidekick' and was rewarded with a substantial windfall. He anonymously offered a former teen superhero support group, [[Loners (Earth-616)|Excelsior]], a one million dollar donation if they could track down the children of the criminal group [[Pride (Earth-616)|The Pride]], who were operating in [[Los Angeles]] as the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]] after [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] informed him they had left their foster homes. The group ultimately failed to bring the Runaways in but Rick revealed himself as their benefactor and still suggested they turn their support group into a team to help deal with the uprise in superpowered crime in [[California (State)|California]] that had resulted from the death of the Pride.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 1|6}}

When the Hulk returned to Earth from [[Sakaar]] where he had been exiled, Jones attempted to calm him down by telling him about Captain America's death and the way the heroes had changed while he was gone, but just when the Hulk had calmed down and was listening to him, [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]] invaded the Hulk's mind reigniting his rage.{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 2}} Rick later went to Strange's [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] to try and speak with him, but was stopped by the Hulk's [[Warbound (Earth-616)|Warbound]].{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 3}} He was able to escape the [[Madison Square Garden]] arena he was taken to when Dr. Strange arrived and attacked the hulk, utilizing the power of the demon [[Zom (Earth-616)|Zom]], and again attempted to talk the Hulk down by reminding that he was a hero and Bruce Banner at heart to no avail.{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 4}} Once the Hulk had finally calmed and reverted to Bruce Banner, Rick attempted to embrace him but was stabbed by a member of the Hulk's Warbound, [[Miek (Earth-616)|Miek]], causing Bruce to hulk out once more and learn that Miek had been responsible for the destruction of Sakaar.{{r|World War Hulk Vol 1 5}}

===A-Bomb===
[[File:Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616) and Richard Jones (Earth-616) from Hulk Vol 2 3 0001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Red Hulk vs the A-Bomb]]
Wounded, Rick was transported to the gamma bomb site that gave birth to the original Hulk. After being dropped off, he encountered the [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]]. After seeing that he had murdered Emil Blonsky, the [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Abomination]], Rick was transformed by [[Intelligencia (Earth-616)|Intelligencia]] members the [[Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)|Leader]] and [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]] into a new blue creature who quite resembled the Abomination;{{r|Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk #3}} calling himself '''A-Bomb'''. In his new form, he was much like the original Hulk incarnation in that he could not remember being anybody else once the transformation was complete, had a temper which flared easily, and simplified speech patterns. He held his own against the Red Hulk for an extended period of time, withstanding all of his blows and injuring him multiple times, which previously nobody had been able to accomplish. The battle was interrupted by several giant android harpies that were specifically designed by United States Military in case Bruce Banner escaped the facility as the Hulk. A-Bomb has proven to hold onto fragments of his memories as Rick Jones because he recognized the harpies all had the face of [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Betty Ross]]; Bruce Banner's first love. A-Bomb managed to disable one mid-flight, and they both crashed to Earth. The robot exploded.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 3}}

[[File:Richard Jones (Earth-616) and Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Hulk Vol 2 13 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]
A-Bomb joined with several heroes including the Avengers, the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] and the Hulk to help stop an impending earthquake in [[San Francisco]] which was caused by Red Hulk.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 5}} After the Red Hulk was defeated, A-Bomb reverted back to Rick. He attempted to reveal who Red Hulk really was, but was shot and dragged away by [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Doc Samson]] from the area.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 6}}

Rick would use his powers as A-Bomb to help people, but when the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], under a new persona called "Doc Green," decided to eliminate all the other Gamma powered people, he started with Rick. A-Bomb confronted Doc Green and refused to be "cured," but ultimately, Hulk proved himself stronger, and injected A-Bomb with a dose of the cure, which made Rick completely human once more.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 6}}

===Whisperer===
As a byproduct of being depowered, Rick's brain suffered side effects, he discovered his learning capabilities had been greatly increased. He decided to direct his new ability towards communications technology, and ended up becoming a hacktivist known as the '''Whisperer'''.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Alpha #1}} One of Rick's major accomplishments as the Whisperer was leaking to the public the existence of the proposal for a S.H.I.E.L.D. project named Kobik, which consisted of the fusion of different fragments of [[Cosmic Cube]]s into a single one, to reshape reality as it would be deemed necessary.

When S.H.I.E.L.D. tried to hunt the Whisperer down, he was helped by [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America (Sam Wilson)]] to evade the authorities, as Cap believed the Whisperer's intentions to be righteous and opposed S.H.I.E.L.D.'s potential disproportionate retribution. From then on, Rick became an ally of Sam Wilson, while keeping his identity a secret, helping him in numerous cases.{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson #2}} Shortly later, Rick found out that the Kobik program had actually never been terminated. {{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Alpha #1}} He gave Sam Wilson the location of the [[Pleasant Hill|secret S.H.I.E.L.D. site]] and fled into the underground, only to be captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents because Rick had misjudged [[Jemma Simmons (Earth-616)|Jemma Simmons]].{{r|Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. #3}} He subsequently was freed by the new [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]]'s [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] whom he had contacted.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 8}}

Even though the New Avengers had rescued Rick, he doubted their true intentions due to the track record of the previous iteration of A.I.M.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 9}} This lack of trust prompted Rick to refuse to flee from [[Hydrobase|Avengers Island]] through a portal to the [[Savage Land]] when S.H.I.E.L.D. forces invaded the facilities. Instead, Rick remained hidden in the island,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 10}} and eventually escaped unnoticed by the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents confiscating it. Rick was tracked down by Captain America,{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Omega #1}} and offered amnesty for his crimes as the Whisperer at the cost of being forced to work for S.H.I.E.L.D. as tech support and aid Captain America in his missions to fight [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #1}} Unbeknownst to anybody, Captain America had secretly been replaced by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|a twisted and evil version of himself]] by the sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 2}} Rogers used Rick's position in S.H.I.E.L.D. to trick him into handing him the codes to the [[Planetary Defense Shield]],{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 16}} allowing Rogers to strand many heroes in space behind the Defense Shield while at the mercy of invading [[Chitauri]] to help pave the way for Hydra's takeover of the United States.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}}

After Rogers came out as a member of Hydra and took over the United States, Rick was taken into protective custody. While in Hydra custody, Rick hacked into Hydra's network and obtain files that belonged to Hydra scientist [[Erik Selvig (Earth-616)|Erik Selvig]] that would reveal the truth about Rogers. Rick sent the data over to hacker [[Rayshaun Lucas (Earth-616)|Rayshaun Lucas]]. When Hydra found out about Rick's actions, he was arrested and thrown in jail. Rogers met with Rick in his prison cell and tried to convince Rick to tell him what data he had taken. Rick refused to cooperate and was convinced that Rogers was being brainwashed into believing he was a Hydra agent. Under pressure from the [[High Council of Hydra (Earth-616)|High Council of Hydra]] to get tough on Hydra's enemies, Rogers decided to make an example of Rick and had him executed by firing squad on live television. Before being shot, Rick shouted out, "Avengers Assemble!"{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} His body was later buried in [[Severin Memorial Cemetery]].{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 15}}

===Shadow Base===
[[File:Immortal Hulk Vol 1 19 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|200px|As Abomination]]
As part of their continued efforts to detain the Hulk, the covert organization [[United States Hulk Operations (Earth-616)|Shadow Base]] disinterred Rick's body and used it as "scaffolding" for a shell of [[Gamma-Activated Tissue]] recovered from the remains of Emil Blonsky, the original Abomination. The procedure encased the corpse in a cocoon,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 16}} bringing Jones back to life, and rapidly evolving him into a nightmarish and horrific beast with an appearance similar to that of Abomination's, but with several rows of finger-like mandibles almost completely concealing a head with two human faces, both contorted in agony.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 17}}

The mutated Rick was sent to attack Bruce Banner, who was hiding out in [[Reno (Nevada)|Reno]], [[Nevada (State)|Nevada]].{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 18}} He almost succeeded, using an acidic secretion to dismember the Hulk, until Betty Ross intervened, having been mutated into the Harpy.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 19}} During the subsequent fight, the Hulk dug up Rick's body from the mutagenic shell and took off with it.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 20}} Rick eventually recovered, having developed the ability to emanate gamma radiation,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 22}} but with his mind secretly taken over by the [[Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)|Leader]] in the process.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 33}} Feigning to be Rick, the Leader provided the Hulk and his allies with the location of Shadow Base,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 22}} resulting on a raid after which the Hulk seized command of the operation from its unhinged leader, [[Reginald Fortean (Earth-616)|General Fortean]].{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 24}}

The Leader kept puppeteering Rick as he joined Banner's efforts to repurpose Shadow Base to embark on a countercultural movement to  fight humankind for the destruction of the environment,{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 26}} only revealing himself to one of the Hulk's enemies, the [[Dario Agger (Earth-616)|Minotaur]], after he had been left incapacitated when his ally [[Xemnu (Earth-616)|Xemnu]] turned against him and mangled him.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 33}} After Xemnu's defeat skyrocketed the Hulk's popularity, he was invited to [[Georgeville]]. During a photo-op, the Leader used Rick to overload the Hulk with gamma radiation, causing him to detonate.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 35}} 

[[File:Richard Jones (Earth-616) and Delbert Frye (Earth-616) from Immortal Hulk Vol 1 41 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Merged with Del Frye]]
The gamma blast devastated the surrounding area, but the reporters at the scene were protected by Rick from the blast, leaving him severely deformed; his body elongated with extra arms and legs sprouted. The Leader concurrently took control of [[Delbert Frye (Earth-616)|Del Frye]], a gamma mutate in custody of Shadow Base. With his concentration spread thin over Frye and Rick in addition to his probing of the Hulk's mind, the Leader accidentally let his control over Rick show when [[Gamma Flight (Alpha Flight Space Program) (Earth-616)|Gamma Flight]] arrived at Georgeville to detain the Hulk.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 36}} Eventually, Rick was teleported back to Shadow Base like the Leader predicted.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 37}} Through Rick Jones, the Leader attempted to entice Shadow Base operative [[Charlene McGowan (Earth-616)|Dr. McGowan]] into joining his side, but she refused and attempted to stop him by activating the base's translocator on Rick, splitting him in half and seemingly killing him.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 38}} After Shadow Base had been abandoned, Rick was forcibly merged with Del Frye.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 41}}

Later, Rick and Del Frye used intense radiation to burrow through the ground until they reached the surface, exclaiming that they were free.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 43}} They were immediately attacked by Doc Samson in the body of Sasquatch out of the belief that they were still under the Leader's control and due to the fury from Sasquatch's body. Doc Samson eventually stopped when he realized that Rick and Frye weren't fighting back.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 44}}

[[Michael Twoyoungmen (Earth-616)|Shaman]] determined that Rick and Frye couldn't be separated, but he was able to ease their pain. When Shaman's radio gave out a radio announcement of the Hulk fighting the [[U-Foes (Earth-616)|U-Foes]], Rick expressed interest in helping his friend.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 45|46}}

Rick and Del joined Gamma Flight and teleported to [[Manhattan]] where Hulk and Betty were fighting the Avengers. Rick and Del didn't participate in the fight. Instead, Rick talked with Captain America and was shocked by Rick's new appearance. Gamma Flight, Hulk, Harpy, and new ally She-Hulk eventually teleported to safety to a warehouse in [[Brooklyn]].{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 47}}

Because Gamma Flight aided the Hulk, Gamma Flight was forced to go on the run. Rick and Del were forced to adjust to the new living situation. They also struggled to adjust to sharing one body as their minds were often at odds with one another about what to do.{{r|Gamma Flight Vol 1 1}}

When Dr. McGowan thought most of Gamma Flight had died due to the translocator malfunctioning, Rick and Del offered to help McGowan through some sort of power Rick had that allowed him to sense the locations of gamma mutates. Rick and Del had trouble focusing at first due to their shared minds. So, McGowan gave the pair a ball to play with to help focus their minds. With this, Rick was able to help McGowan locate Gamma Flight and teleported them while Del powered the translocator.{{r|Gamma Flight Vol 1 3}}

| Powers                  = '''[[Destiny Force]]:''' On rare occasions, and through unusual circumstances, Jones has been able to tap into a mysterious, near-limitless energy source known as the [[:Glossary:Destiny Force|Destiny Force]]. The Destiny Force is believed to be inherent in all humanity. Jones has used this power to alter reality in the past by bringing figures from his own imagination to life or even figures from different times of existence. He has proven able to render thousands of Kree and Skrull warriors immobile with a thought, single-handedly overcome the Atlantean army, augment all of his own physical attributes, heal himself after sustaining life threatening energies, and levitate. The full limits of the Destiny Force, its overall nature, and why Jones has been able to harness it at only certain times, all these are currently unknown.{{Citation}}

'''Enhanced Learning Capabilities:''' As a consequence of being depowered from his A-Bomb form, Rick's brain was changed. According to himself, he was now able to pick new skills up lightning-fast.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Alpha #1}}

'''Gamma Mutation:''' After being free from the Gamma-Activated Tissue, Rick developed some new powers:
* '''Energy Projection:''' Rick is able to release gamma energy at will. The full extent of the ability and how much control of it he has are unrevealed. He is able to release energy from his hands intense enough to melt through a thick, steel door.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 22|23}}
* '''Flight:''' Rick is able to fly through the air through unknown means.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 23}}
* '''Gamma Tracking:''' Rick is able to track gamma mutates through some sort of extrasensory power.{{r|Gamma Flight Vol 1 3}}

'''A-Bomb:''' 
* '''Physical Transformation:''' After being exposed to a weapon powered by gamma radiation designed for use against the Hulk, Jones was mutated by the radiation. As a result, Jones can transform into a superhuman form that resembles the Abomination. Jones has demonstrated the ability to transform at will and, when doing so, gains an additional 4 feet 3 inches in height and 1,835 pounds of muscle, bone and connective tissue to his frame. Jones' skin takes on a scaly sort of appearance, his eyes change color and his hair disappears. As of being cured of radiation by Doc Green, he is no longer able to do this.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 6}}
** '''Superhuman Strength:''' While transformed into A-Bomb, Jones' musculature, connective tissues and skeletal structure are augmented to levels far beyond those of ordinary humans. As a result, his strength is augmented to great superhuman levels. At his peak, he possesses sufficient superhuman strength to be listed at exactly class 100.{{Citation}}
** '''Suspended Aging:''' For all intents and purposes A-Bomb does not age. Due to his great healing factor that regenerates his cells, and with the gamma energy and Destiny Force that empowers him, A-Bomb does not age at all.{{Citation}}
** '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Jones' musculature as A-Bomb is more efficient than that of an ordinary human. As a result, his muscles produce less fatigue toxins during physical activity than those of normal humans. Though the exact limit of his stamina isn't known, he can at least exert himself for several hours without fatigue impairing his overall capabilities.{{Citation}}
** '''Superhuman Durability:''' As A-Bomb, Jones' superhuman body is much tougher and more resistant to injury than that of an ordinary human. Since Jones' ability to transform into his superhuman form is a recent development, the full limits of his resistance to injury isn't known. However, his hide is exceptionally tough and can withstand repeated blows by a foe as physically powerful as the Red Hulk without sustaining injury. His body can also withstand falls from great heights and exposure to temperature extremes without being damaged. He has also demonstrated that his hide is bulletproof as Red Hulk tried to use a mini-gun from on him but it merely tickles A-Bomb.{{Citation}}
** '''Self Sustenance:''' A-Bomb does not need air, water, food, or sleep to survive.{{Citation}}
** '''Camouflage:''' He also has a camouflage ability, being able to turn nearly invisible to match his environment.{{Citation}}

'''Subject B / Abomination:''' 
* '''Transformation:''' After having the Abomination's tissue grafted to his corpse, Jones was resurrected into a new, transformed state.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 16|17}} He lost these powers when the Abomination tissue grafted to him was removed by Hulk.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 20}}
** '''Superhuman Strength:''' He possesses an unknown level of super strength, but it's enough to for him crush a taxi and match the strength of the Hulk.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 18}}
** '''Superhuman Durability:''' He also appears to have a high level of durability as he was able to withstand a punch from Hulk and not appear to have any injuries.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 18}}
** '''Regeneration:''' According to one of his operators, Rick is able to recover from grievous injuries, even lost organs.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 20}}
** '''Claws:''' Rick has a claw on each one of his fingers sharp enough to scratch even the Hulk.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 18}}
** '''Acidic-Poison Generation:''' Jones could generate a highly caustic solvent that was potent enough to dissolve the flesh of the Hulk and negate his healing factor. He could both secrete this gastric substance from his hands and spit it out from his two mouths. Jones, however, is limited to how much toxic acid he could generate and needs to eat in order to create more. He also loses this ability temporarily if he loses his stomach until he recovers.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 19}}

| Abilities               = Jones is an accomplished gymnast and hand to hand combatant. Jones has a thorough knowledge of Judo and Karate and has even had some training from [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] himself. He also has exceptional musical talent and has proven himself to be a skilled songwriter, guitarist and harmonica player.{{Citation}}

'''Skilled Combatant:''' After received training by Captain America in several martial arts including combat gymnastics, he is a highly experienced hand-to-hand combatant.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 5}} As A-Bomb, he does not seem to remember any of it but is a natural fighter, making him a formidable opponent in combat.{{Citation}}

'''Computer Skills:''' Through his altered brain chemistry, Rick learned how to be a skilled computer user.{{r|Avengers Standoff: Assault On Pleasant Hill Alpha #1}} With his skills, he is able to hack into the computers of high-level organizations like S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson #2}}

* '''Impaired Intelligence:''' During his brief tenure as the Hulk, Rick also suffered from a decrease in intellect, similar to many of Banner’s incarnations as the monster.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 325}} As A-Bomb, Jones' intelligence was impaired and below that of an average human. As A-Bomb, he had little recall of his memories or his past. He loses all of his musical abilities and all but the most rudimentary form of combat skills. Jones was able to get control of his mind as A-Bomb, and retained all of his intelligence and possessed complete control as A-Bomb, but he was also trapped in his A-Bomb form. Rick eventually gained the ability to transform at will, retaining his mind in his A-Bomb form due to the Hulk's wish.{{r|Incredible Hulks Vol 1 635}} As Subject B, Rick had no control of his mind and could barely speak. He would also attack innocent people that cross his path.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 18}} After being freed from the Gamma-Activated Tissue, Rick regained control over his mind, but his level of intelligence has a tendency to vary from normal to limited.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 22|23}}
* Because he and Del Frye share one body, their minds struggle to adjust to another and at times can't perform everyday tasks.{{r|Gamma Flight Vol 1 1}}
