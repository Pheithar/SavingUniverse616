| History                 = The creature known only as Manphibian was born on an unknown alien world over a thousand years ago. A member of his species attacked Manphibian, murdering his mate in the process. The alien fled from his home world, and Manphibian pursued him across several star systems in the hopes of exacting revenge. He eventually chased him to the planet Earth where both aliens found themselves trapped underground for a millennium.

Years passed, and in that time an industrialist named [[Aaron Fox (Earth-616)|Aaron Fox]] built an oil refinery overtop the ground where the Manphibian laid buried. Persistent drilling in Shaft #27 awakened the two aliens, and they climbed their way to the surface. The rogue alien continued to satisfy his murderous ways and attacked [[Beth Fox (Earth-616)|Beth Fox]], Aaron Fox's wife dragging her underwater. Manphibian battled his old adversary and rescued Beth, but the incident earned him the attention of Aaron Fox. Fox mobilized an attack helicopter and fired several missiles at the Manphibian. The missiles rained down destroying Shaft #27, and Manphibian was able to escape during the chaos. Manphibian was not the only creature to survive the carnage however. The alien who murdered his mate was still at large, and Manphibian spent the next several years scouring the Earth in search of him. It remains unknown whether he ever successfully satisfied his need for vengeance.{{r|Legion of Monsters Vol 1 1}}

Manphibian and his mate had multiple offsprings that were simultaneously trapped on Earth. Due to the death of his mate, Manphibian had to raise them on his own.

At some point, Manphibian was recruited by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] in order to be part of [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]'s [[Howling Commandos]]. Manphibian was with the Howling Commandos when they launched an assault on the forces of [[Merlin]].{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos Vol 1 #1|6}}

Manphibian joined the [[Legion of Monsters]] in fighting [[Hunter of Monster Special Force (Earth-616)|Hunter of Monster Special Force]]. During the war Manphibian's children were killed after being tortured by [[Robert Hellsgaard (Earth-616)|Robert Hellsgaard]].

Manphibian was one of several beings (along with the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]]) captured by [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]] to appear in one of Mojo's films. He was paired up with Blade, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, Man-Thing, and Satana as the [[Avengers of the Supernatural (Earth-616)|Avengers of the Supernatural]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Annual Vol 1 #1}}

The Manphibian resurfaced a short time ago and was inducted into a S.H.I.E.L.D. Special Forces unit called the [[Howling Commandos (S.H.I.E.L.D.) (Earth-616)|Howling Commandos]] (not to be confused with the original [[Howling Commandos (WWII) (Earth-616)|Howling Commandos]] from World War II). The team was comprised of other powerful monsters including Warwolf, Vampire by Night, and the Living Mummy. As a member, the Manphibian participated in a mission to Afghanistan to stop the threat of a terrorist organization known as the Lords of the Living Lightning.{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos Vol 1 2|6}}

At some point, Manphibian came in contact with Deadpool and joined his crew.

* Manphibian is an analog to the obscure DC Comics character known as [[w:c:DC:Devil Fish (Pre-Zero Hour)|Devil-Fish]]. Devil-Fish first appeared in Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes #202. Both Devil-Fish and Manphibian were original concepts designed by [[Dave Cockrum]]. Cockrum conceived both characters out of a personal love for the 1955 Universal Studios film, ''The Creature from the Black Lagoon''. Cockrum later re-imagined the Manphibian character for a resin model kit produced by Action Hobbies. <ref>''[http://www.nightscrawlers.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=4680 Dave Cockrum forum at Nightcrawlers]''</ref>
