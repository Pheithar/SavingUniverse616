===Origin===
Kierrok was created by [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]] the [[Elder Gods of Earth|Elder God]] and was the master of the [[N'Garai]] who once ruled Earth millennia ago.

===Freed by [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]===
Kierrok was accidentally released from his own dimension by [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], who was lashing out with his eye beams, angry and saddened by [[John Proudstar (Earth-616)|John Proudstar]]'s death. Cyclops' beams hit a magic obelisk called a Cairn, and Kierrok appeared and attacked the X-Mansion. [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] was mentally overwhelmed by Kierrok's evil. [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] was able to find the obelisk and destroyed it, sealing Kierrok back in his own dimension.{{r|X-Men #96}}

Later, the obelisk rose again and a demon escaped. It was found by a feral [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] who killed it. Wolverine followed another demon back to Kierrok's dimension and began fighting the N'Garai. He slaughtered many of the demons and was fighting Kierrok himself when [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] found them. Fearing that Wolverine could kill him, Kierrok banished them both back to Earth and sealed the Cairn.{{Citation}}

A slave caste of demons, the [[Ru'Tai]], witnessed Wolverine's success and rebelled against Kierrok and killed him. Kierrok's eye was kept as a trophy by [[Pilgrimm (Earth-616)|Pilgrimm]], a Ru'Tai leader.{{Citation}}
