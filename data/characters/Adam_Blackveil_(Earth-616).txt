| Quotation               = [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]] built Adam to be the perfect human... A fabricated product of [[Gardeners|a life-creating system]]. Even better than [[Homo sapiens|the real thing]]. The last [[White Event]] changed Adam into something more--A [[Nightmask]] capable of navigating [[Superflow|the dreamspace of human potential]]. But the cost of this power is temporal regression--A gradual return to his prefabricated, primordial state. This is believed to be a flaw--Some accidental glitch in one of the universal systems that made him what he is. But that's a simple, microscopic way of looking at a much broader dilemma. Don't you understand? Here at the end times, they're '''all''' broken systems.

| History                 = "Adam" was the first humanoid being created by [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]] in his effort to create life anew on Earth. But as soon as he emerged from his cocoon, his ability to speak in [[Builder Machine Code]] made Nihilo and his sister [[Abyss (Ex Nihilo's) (Earth-616)|Abyss]] think something was wrong. He was later taken into custody of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] in order to study him and try to decode his language. Tony Stark managed to decode his name into "Blackveil."{{r|Avengers Vol 5 3}}

After a therapy session with the new [[Tamara Devoux (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]], [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]] was told the presence of it was because the universe was dying. Captain Universe and "Blackveil" met, and as she managed to translate his language correctly, she discovered his name was Nightmask and he was announcing that the [[White Event]] was coming to Earth. In that moment, a blaze of lightning from outer space hit the Earth.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 6}}

===Starbrand===
[[File:Kevin Connor (Earth-616) and Adam Blackveil (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 5 9 001.jpg|left|thumb|Nightmask and Starbrand confront Ex Nihilo.]]
Nightmask led the Avengers in finding the [[Star Brand]] host, [[Kevin Connor (Earth-616)|Kevin Connor]], who was located at the ruins of a college, and aided them in destroying his empowerment.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 7}}

After a brief battle with the Avengers, Kevin Connor was taken by Nightmask to Mars, in order to seek help from Ex Nihilo. In the meantime, he explained to Starbrand what caused his powers and what his purpose was.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 8}} On Mars, Ex Nihilo revealed that the White Event was caused by his attempts to make Earth sentient.

Nightmask teleported Connor and himself to Croatia, one of the places modified by Ex Nihilo, where strange creatures started forming a brain-like structure. The "brain" tried to absorb Nightmask, but he was rescued by Starbrand, who accidentally killed the organism in the process, "killing" the Earth's potential consciousness. The Avengers arrived on the scene and attempted to stop them. They fought back until Starbrand surrendered. As they were out of options, the heroes decided it would be better for Starbrand to be off the Earth and placed him in Tony Stark's [[wikipedia:Dyson Sphere|Dyson Sphere]] which was under construction around the Sun, in the company of Nightmask.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 9}}

When [[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]] sensed a new threat coming to Earth, she advised the Avengers to recruit Nightmask and Star Brand into the team, which they did.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 17}}

===Time Runs Out===
After the Avengers fell into S.H.I.E.L.D. authority, Star Brand and Nightmask left the team to investigate the decay of the universe. For some reason, Nightmask began to rejuvenate. They returned to Earth when they received a message from [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]], inviting them to join [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|his own Avengers team]] as there had been new progress on the research related to [[Glossary:Incursion|Incursions]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}}

Using [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]]'s resources, Sunspot managed to put into operation a machine capable of transporting individuals across the [[Multiverse]], in hopes of finding the source of the decay of the Multiverse, and a group of them, the "Multiversal Avengers," embarked in said mission. Nightmask was among this heroes.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 36}}
[[File:Nightmask (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 5 35 001.png|thumb|right|200px|Rejuvenated Nightmask]]
In their journey, the Multiversal Avengers arrived to the base of the [[Black Priests (Multiverse)|Black Priests]], whom they believed to be enemies, as they would destroy alternate Earths. After discovering their true motivation, that of saving the Multiverse, the Multiversal Avengers allied with the Black Priests, and were informed of the true enemies they had to face, the [[Beyonders|Ivory Kings]] and [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Rabum Alal]]. While the Black Priests tried to find Rabum Alal, the Multiversal Avengers would set out to find the Ivory Kings (also known as the Beyonders).{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 27}}

The Avengers traveled across numerous universes, navigating the map left by the [[Mapmakers (Multiverse)|Mapmakers]]. The use of his powers caused Nightmask to rejuvenate, and the final jump across universes caused him to revert into non-existence.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 32}}

===All New All Different===
When the universe came back to life, so did Nightmask and the rest of its inhabitants, with no memory of their temporary demise. After defeating [[Donald Gill (Earth-616)|Blizzard]] in [[China]], he was offered membership by [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] in his New Avengers, but he declined and instead, he started attending college along with [[Kevin Connor (Earth-616)|Starbrand]].{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask #1}}

On the first day of college, they were attacked by mind-controlled [[Robert Hunter (Earth-616)|Nitro]], [[Franklin Hall (Earth-616)|Graviton]] and [[Donald Gill (Earth-616)|Blizzard]] twice,{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask #2}} and the second time almost cost Kevin's life, because he was fighting the three of them on his own. Meanwhile, Adam was tracking the source of their control and found out the responsible were the [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]]'s children [[Explosion (Earth-616)|Explosion]], [[Gravitation (Earth-616)|Gravitation]] and [[Entropy (Earth-616)|Entropy]]. After taking away their control over the Earth criminals, he returned to Earth and both he and Kevin attended their first college party.{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask #4}}

The next day, Kevin and Adam met with Kolobus, after [[Gustav Brandt (Earth-616)|Libra]] brought them together. Then, Kolobus helped them prevent the [[Kree]] [[Va-Sohn (Earth-616)|Starbrand]] from killing Kevin and destroying Earth, although, in the end, it was revealed that there's a fail-safe in the Starbrand power that causes them to become attracted to one another and kiss. Because of this, they call off the fight and Va-Sohn agrees not to attack any more worlds, as Kevin would be there to "make things cosmically awkward". Therefore, Va-sohn and [[Joras-Kyl (Earth-616)|Joras-Kyl]] are returned to their homeworld to reconsider their options.{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask #6}}

===[[Secret Empire]]===
When trillions of [[Chitauri]] were approaching the [[Earth]], heavy-hitter superheroes prepared to hold the line while [[Anthony Stark (Third A.I.) (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and [[Riri Williams (Earth-616)|Ironheart]] fixed the [[Planetary Defense Shield]]. Meanwhile, it was revealed the Shield's malfunctions were actually purposefully caused by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America]], with superficial damage of Hydra's attack covering that up. Rogers activated the Shield.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} leaving Starbrand, Nightmask, and the rest of the heroes on Earth's orbit exiled on the other side.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 3}}

| Powers                  = Nightmask is a genetically perfect human being artificially created from [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]]'s machine with the purpose of being the first of a new race of [[Human|humans]]. Yet somehow, he was altered with aspects not programmed into his genetic code. This change may somehow be related to the universal transcendent advent called the [[White Event]], bestowing upon him strange new powers.

'''Cosmic Awareness'''

'''Techno-Communication:''' Nightmask has the ability to control and radically alter machines.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 7}} Moreover, he can not only manipulate technology, re-purposing it to his will, but can somehow communicate with it as though it were sentient. Currently it is unknown how he does so, whether it be psionic, physical, cosmic or some other outer source that enables its use, but it's believed to be related to the [[Builders (Race)|Builders]].

'''Energy Halos:''' Nightmask's powers often manifest themselves as light-blue energized patterns in the form of energy discharges, often accompanied by strange symbols gravitating around and off of his skin and clothing. It is assumed that these symbols give him other abilities, such as:

* '''Portals:''' Possesses vast matter/energy transportation ability, by creating portals in and out of the [[Superflow]], an extra dimensional dream-scape which is a shortcut between any two points in space. This also enables him to communicate and see people through space.{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask #4}}

* '''Energy Blast:''' Through his halos Nightmask can disperse and direct concussive force blasts from his person.

* '''Clothes Changing:''' Nightmask is able to change is clothes at will.
[[File:Adam_Blackveil_(Earth-616)_from_Starbrand_&_Nightmask_Vol_1_1_001.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Displaying information.]]
* '''Holographic Projection:''' Nightmask can also use his Halos to project holograms with audio projection and access databases.
