The first attack was repelled by the various superheroes guarding the craft, but [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-14042)|Loki]], who was working for Dormammu at the time, smuggled a second group inside using [[Digital Identity Securement Kit|DISKs]], and gave them a power boost by creating feelings of despair and disorder among the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.
