| Overview                = '''Dr. Otto Octavius''' is a highly intelligent and prideful scientist, better known as the criminal mastermind '''Doctor Octopus.''' During an atomic research project, Octavius' body was fused to four mechanical, tentacle-like arms, also causing him severe damage that turned him into a criminal. He clashed with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and went to become one his greatest enemies.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 3}} After multiple battles, Otto's body started to fail and decay itself.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 600}} In one last attempt to survive, Otto swapped brains with his nemesis, leaving Spider-Man to die in his fragile body.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 698}} However, residual memories caused Otto to understand the responsability of being a hero and strived to become the '''Superior Spider-Man,''' a better crime-fighter that his nemesis ever was.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 700}}{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 1}} Despite his best efforts, Otto's ruthless method of justice was futile to stop the returning [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]], forcing Otto to cede control of his body back to Spider-Man, sacrificing himself in the process.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 30}}

A digital backup of Otto's mind survived and housed himself in the robotic body of the '''Living Brain.'''{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 18}} Using the cloning technology of the new [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Jackal]] at his disposal, Otto transferred his digital mind to a new body made from his and Spider-Man's genes,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 24}} assuming the alias of the '''Superior Octopus''' while working with [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 29}} Creating the identity of "Elliot Tolliver," Otto moved to [[San Francisco]], where he resumed his activities as the Superior Spider-Man.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 1}} Despite all the good he had done, Otto was forced to make a deal with [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] to return to his Doctor Octopus body and mind to defeat another criminal mastermind.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 12}}

| History                 = ===Early Life===
Born in [[Schenectady]], [[New York (State)|New York]], to a lower-class family, only child Otto Octavius was to be raised by his overbearing [[Mary Lavinia Octavius (Earth-616)|mother]] and his abusive [[Torbert Octavius (Earth-616)|father]]. During his youth, Otto would often receive beatings at home, or school. His father would roar at Otto to use violence when dealing with bullies whilst his mother, on the other hand, always put Otto off using violence. Sometimes Otto's father would beat him during rages, earning Otto's hatred.{{r|Spider-Man - Doctor Octopus: Year One #1}}

[[File:Spider-Man - Doctor Octopus Year One Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Doctor Octopus: Year One]]

Otto was accepted into [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T. (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)]]. During Otto's first year of school, Torbert died in a construction accident. During the funeral, Mary confided in her son that "an early death is the fate of a manual laborer" and expected that would go on to great things. Otto returned to school and threw himself into his studies. Otto's hard work paid off when he graduated at the top of his class.{{r|Spider-Man - Doctor Octopus: Year One #1}}

[[File:Otto Octavius (Earth-616) from Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 28.jpg|250px|thumb|left]]
===Atomic Research===
After graduating M.I.T., Otto was hired by the [[Atomic Research Center|U.S. Atomic Research Center]]. To help manipulate radioactive substances from a safe distance, Otto constructed a [[Doctor Octopus' Tentacles|chest harness]] controlling four mechanical, tentacle-like arms - earning him the nickname ''Doctor Octopus''. At work, he had fallen in love with a fellow researcher, [[Mary Alice Anders (Earth-616)|Mary Anders]], and the two started dating. Eventually Otto proposed marriage, which was accepted. Expecting a joyous reaction from his mother, he was surprised that she was against it. She accused Otto of turning his back on her (in truth her overprotective ways led her to think no woman was good enough for his son), causing him to break off his engagement. When Otto discovered his mother dating behind his back, he blew up in rage at her. During the argument, Mary died of a heart attack, leaving Otto with bitterness. Now he was without a girlfriend and held himself responsible for his mother's death.{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited #18}}{{r|Spider-Man - Doctor Octopus: Year One #2|3}}

===Becoming Doctor Octopus===
[[File:Spider-Man Doctor Octopus Negative Exposure Vol 1 5 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Doctor Octopus]]
Consumed with guilt, Otto couldn't fully focus during work, and volatile liquids exploded - bombarding the scientist with radiation. The substances left him capable of mentally controlling the arms, but the accident also caused irreversible brain damage - transforming the respected scientist into a megalomaniacal superhuman criminal.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #3}}{{r|Spider-Man - Doctor Octopus: Year One #4}}

Waking in a hospital, Otto knew this new found strength - combined with his awesome intellect - could render him supremely powerful. Holding the medical staff hostage, Otto forced them to gather lab equipment for him to continue his work. But [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] showed up. Doctor Octopus easily defeated Spider-Man. Doc Ock then took control of a leading nuclear research facility and again squared off with the wall-crawler, who this time defeated him with one punch to the jaw.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #3}}{{r|Spider-Man - Doctor Octopus: Year One #5}}

After serving time, Doc Ock attempted to raise funds by springing gangster [[Blackie Gaxton (Earth-616)|Blackie Gaxton]] from a [[Philadelphia (Pennsylvania)|Philadelphia]] prison - assisted by Gaxton's lawyer, [[Bennett Brant (Earth-616)|Bennett Brant]]. Spider-Man foiled the scheme, but could not save Bennett from being shot in front of his sister, [[Elizabeth Brant (Earth-616)|Betty Brant]]. After escaping from Spider-Man during a scuffle on a getaway boat meant for Gaxton, Octopus travelled throughout the country, committing some of the most spectacular crimes in an attempt to bring Spider-man to confront him. When that failed, Octopus returned to [[New York City|New York]], where he hoped to find Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #11}}

After kidnapping Betty Brant, whom Octopus knew Spider-Man had risked his life saving before, he fought Spider-Man on [[Coney Island]], who was suffering from a severe virus attack, and easily defeated and unmasked him as Peter Parker. Falsely realizing that the weak Peter Parker could not be Spider-Man, Octopus left and went on a rampage, releasing zoo animals and finally confronting the "real" Spider-Man, and was defeated when he was trapped in a burning building.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #12}}

After being imprisoned yet again, a team of specialists found a way to remove his harness. Now believed by the prison to be normal again and without power, they placed his tentacles in another part of the facility. It was at this time that Octopus showed that he had mental control over his arms, even when separated from him over short distances. Using this to his advantage, he summoned his tentacles to return to him and escaped from prison.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1}} 

Otto then deduced that to defeat Spider-Man, he could not do it alone. He decided to bring together a team of villains to destroy Spider-Man, and thus assembled the first [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Six]] to combat Spider-Man. He plotted to kidnap Betty Brant again and make her their hostage. However, Betty was visiting with [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|May Parker]] at the time, who was also captured and taken hostage. Doctor Octopus treated May so kindly, though, that she remained blissfully unaware she had been kidnapped by the charming villain.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #18}} 

[[File:Spider-Man - Doctor Octopus Year One Vol 1 5 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Doctor Octopus Vs. Spider-Man]]
===Master Planner===
Following Spider-Man's defeat of the Sinister Six, Octopus assembled another group of costumed underlings and established an undersea base. Calling himself the Master Planner, he embarked on a series of thefts of experimental substances - seeking to further expand his mastery of the atomic sciences. His goal: to develop a radiation ray with which he could rule the world. But his plan was fated to entwine with Spider-Man's: when May fell sick, Peter provided her with a blood transfusion - not realizing the radioactivity in his plasma would kill her.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #31}}

The only substance capable of saving her was the experimental [[ISO-36]]. Peter managed to obtain enough money to fund the operation, but the Master Planner's forces hijacked the shipment for their own deadly research. Spider-Man tracked down the Master Planner to his underwater hideout and confronted his foe, revealed to be Doc Ock. After the base was destroyed, Doctor Octopus escaped once more. Spider-Man recovered the ISO-36 and saved Aunt May's life with the aid of Dr. Curt Connors (the [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Lizard]]).{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #32}}

Doctor Octopus' next scheme involved the theft of the [[Nullifier]], a projector that could disable any device. After two failed attempts, Otto finally succeeded on his third. Turning the Nullifier against Spider-Man, he caused the wall-crawler to lose his memory and told him that they were allies. He then enlisted Spider-Man's help to steal the remaining components for the device.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #53}} Though Spider-Man had not regained his memory, his instinctive spider-sense persuaded him not to trust Doc Ock, and Otto was defeated once more.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #54}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #55}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #56}}

===Marriage===
Now imprisoned, with his arms confiscated, Otto again demonstrated that the range of his psionic control over the tentacles had increased to a far greater distance than previously believed.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #88}} The arms freed him from captivity; after hijacking a plane and exploding it, Doc Ock, believed to be dead, decided to rampage through the city, bringing attention to himself from Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #89}} In the ensuing battle between the two, Doc Ock accidentally knocked over a chimney, which killed [[George Stacy (Earth-616)|George Stacy]] (the father of [[Gwendolyne Stacy (Earth-616)|Gwen Stacy]], the first true love of Spider-Man), who was preventing a child from being crushed by the chimney.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #90}}

Free again, Doc Ock seized upon the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]]'s absence to gather his forces and launch an all-out gang war against [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]]'s thugs.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #114}} But Spider-Man's involvement quickly resulted in Doc Ock's return to prison.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #115}} While incarcerated, Doctor Octopus learned May Parker had inherited a small Canadian island containing a commercial nuclear reactor. On his release, he set out to woo and marry May. But Hammerhead interrupted the wedding, and the ensuing chase and brawl led to the destruction of the reactor.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #131}}

Octopus survived the explosion and ended up living as a derelict in the [[Bowery]], being haunted by the ghost of Hammerhead.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #152}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #154}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #156}} He sought out May Parker who took him back in even though he had left her stranded at the altar, leading him to kidnap her when he was attacked by Hammerhead.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #157}} He constructed a device to destroy the host, which instead brought Hammerhead back to life,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #158}} who kidnapped Aunt May. Octopus and Spider-Man briefly teamed up to rescue her.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #159}}

Doc later tried to hijack an atomic powered submarine.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Annual #1}} He also attempted to poison New York with printers' ink, and fought the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] and Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual #15}} Doc next battled the [[Leland Owlsley (Earth-616)|Owl]] and his gang.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #73}}{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #74|76}} He successfully deactivated a nuclear reactor before a meltdown.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #124}} [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]] diagnosed Doc Ock as suffering from multiple personality disorder.{{r|Fantastic Four #267}}

===Secret Wars===
Doc was taken to the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]]'s [[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]], where he fought a group of heroes and plotted against [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] for leadership of the group of villains. He was able to defeat the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] until [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] came to their aid.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #1}}{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #2|12}}

===Fear of Spider-Man===
When Doc Ock went to war with the Owl,{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #75}} Spider-Man and the [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] attempted to intervene. Devastated that the confrontation had left the Black Cat near death,{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #76}} a cold-hearted Peter said farewell to his friends before entering what he believed to be his final showdown with Doctor Octopus. Spider-Man's victory was remorseless, and Doc Ock developed a morbid fear of his arachnid foe.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #79}} Imprisoned in a mental institution, Otto struggled with his overwhelming phobia of Spider-Man. Knowing he could not face his foe directly, Ock's next plan involved the use of biological weapons to kill the entire population of New York. Spider-Man was forced to fake a humiliating defeat lest the city be destroyed, restoring Otto's self-confidence.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #296}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #297}}

===Savior of Spider-Man===
Doctor Octopus recruits [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]] and [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]] for the New Sinister Six.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #334}} His next recruits were [[Jason Macendale Jr. (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]] and [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #335}} His final recruit was the [[Adrian Toomes (Earth-616)|Vulture]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #336}} Doc Ock with his new Sinister Six planned to take over the world and destroy Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #337}} After trying to gas Spider-Man,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #338}} Spider-Man defeated the villains.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #339}}

Learning his once-to-be-fiancée Mary Alice was dying from AIDS, Otto began a desperate search for a cure - stealing research materials to do so. His attempts failed, Mary Alice died, and the villain meekly surrendered to Spider-Man.{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited #3}} A world-weary Otto nonetheless escaped from prison. At the time, Spider-Man was dying from a chemical virus. Hoping to one day kill the hero himself, Doc Ock captured and unmasked his foe. Analyzing the virus, Otto offered him a cure. Daring to trust his foe, Peter accepted the mixture and was healed.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #397}}

===Death and Resurrection===
[[File:Peter Parker (Kaine) (Earth-616) kills Otto Octavius (Earth-616) in Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 2 001.jpeg|thumb|left|Death]]
Doctor Octopus was murdered by the insane Peter Parker clone named [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]].{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man #221}} Octavius' student [[Carolyn Trainer (Earth-616)|Carolyn Trainer]] took over as Doctor Octopus II, until the original was resurrected by a branch of the mystical ninja cult known as the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]]. Although Octavius had discovered Peter Parker's dual identity shortly prior to his death while curing Parker of a lethal virus created by the Vulture, he lost all knowledge of it upon his resurrection. The reason for this was the memories he gained came from a computer chip provided by his associate Carolyn Trainer with his recorded memories. That recent memory had not been recorded at the time of his death (It is uncertain whether or not Trainer had some ulterior motive for remodelling Octavius' mind).{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #426|428}}

Octavius attempted to create his own personal assassin in the form of a villainous mutated entity he dubbed "[[Charlotte Witter (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]]", and was involved in a plot involving using prosthetic limbs as mind-control devices, to create an army of minions. He also had to deal with another usurper, in the form of an arrogant-yet-brilliant scientist named [[Luke Carlyle (Earth-616)|Carlyle]], who created his own version of Octavius' harness and who tried to kill Octavius, whose power he envied.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 #43|45}}

Octavius resurfaced in the attempt to kidnap a Palestinian ambassador, in hopes of causing chaos for reasons unknown. His plot was thwarted by Spider-Man and his temporary sidekick the [[John Anderson (Earth-616)|Kiwi Kid]].{{r|{{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 6}}-[[Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 10|10]]}} Octavius was then taken into [[Ryker's Island]] and was drugged and brainwashed to take down the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]]. He interrupted a battle between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and the two villains were struck by lightning and fell into the river below. Octopus was dragged out days later with no memories of the event.{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #12}}

===Civil War===
Octavius unsuccessfully tries to form and lead another version of the Sinister Six, because [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]'s [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] managed to defeat the villainous group, although Ock himself eludes authorities. Doctor Octopus is later seen viewing a telecast of Peter Parker revealing himself to be Spider-Man. Ock then goes rampaging throughout the city, in utter disbelief that not only was he beaten numerous times by a teenager, but of the lost opportunity he had when he unmasked Parker. He is again defeated by Spider-Man, who confronts Doctor Octopus unmasked, after two of Peter's students distract Octavius. He is then sent to [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]]'s super-villain detention facility and is one of the ex-super villains trying to hunt down the renegade super heroes. Ock abandons the team when he realizes being a part of the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] is pointless. However, he was apprehended by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and placed into custody.{{r|Thunderbolts #104|109}}

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 600 Second Printing Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|The decaying Doctor Octopus right after Brand New Day]]
===Brand New Day===
After escaping, Doctor Octopus learned that after all his battles and injuries suffered, his body was failing, giving him just some months to live. He modified himself to be mentally connected to his own army of [[Octobot]]s, and adding four more arms to his harness. His goal then became to use his abilities to take over the utilities of New York City, and turn it into a paradise under his control, though his mind's subconscious also targeted Spider-Man, and disrupted the wedding plans of his ex, Aunt May. Spider-Man and the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] eventually track down his base, save the captive [[John Jonah Jameson, Sr. (Earth-616)|Jay Jameson]] (May's fiancee), [[Carlie Cooper (Earth-616)|Carlie Cooper]], and [[Norah Winters (Earth-616)|Norah Winters]], and finally destroy Doctor Octopus' hold over the city. Doctor Octopus is then able to escape (still holding power over his mini-bots) and vows a "terrible revenge."{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #600}}

Doctor Octopus later assembles a supervillain team consisting of [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]], [[Esteban Corazón de Ablo (Earth-616)|Diablo]], Electro, [[Freak (Vagrant) (Earth-616)|Freak]], Hammerhead, [[Consultant (Earth-616)|Hippo]], Lizard, [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mister Negative]], [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius, the Living Vampire]], Mysterio, [[James Beverley (Earth-616)|Overdrive]], [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]], Sandman, [[Herman Schultz (Earth-616)|Shocker]], [[Johnathon Ohnn (Earth-616)|Spot]], [[Lonnie Lincoln (Earth-616)|Tombstone]], [[Edward Whelan (Earth-616)|Vermin]], and [[James Natale (Earth-616)|Vulture IV]]. He tells them to secure specific items and promised they will receive a reward. First, he targets [[Lily Hollister (Earth-616)|Menace]]'s [[Stanley Osborn (Earth-616)|newborn infant]] despite Spider-Man's interference as it has pure [[Goblin Formula|Goblin Serum]] in its veins which Doctor Octopus thinks that it would help cure his crippling illness.

After Spider-Man grabs the infant from Doctor Octopus, he sends the villains after Spider-Man. Doctor Octopus talks with Chameleon stating that he had placed an Octo-Tracker on Spider-Man in order to track him down. After Chameleon steals the baby from Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus talks with the Chameleon saying that the baby is the first of a new species. Because the serums inside Norman Osborn and Lily Hollister co-mingled when they reproduced, the baby is beyond Octopus' procurement. He refers to it as "Sui Generis" and plans on using the new species' DNA to repair his body.

[[File:Otto Octavius (Earth-616) 0002.jpg|thumb|left|"I'm a doctor": Doc Ock in Origin of the Species]]
When Spider-Man caught Chameleon, he mentioned that the baby is still alive and that the Lizard stole it from him before it can be handed over to Doctor Octopus. Doctor Octopus was looking for the Lizard when Spider-Man arrived. Spider-Man told Doctor Octopus that they will get the baby back from the Lizard and then fight over who will get it. Spider-Man even mentioned to Doctor Octopus that the Lizard is now in a different appearance. When Doctor Octopus attacks Spider-Man, the Lizard attacks Spider-Man. Spider-Man threatens to attack the Lizard with the Lizard serum if he does not give him the baby. Lizard agrees and reveals that he got a blood sample from the baby and found out that Norman Osborn is not the father. The Lizard then gives the baby to Spider-Man saying that if Osborn is not the father, then the baby is of no use to him. Doctor Octopus then attacks the Lizard while Spider-Man escapes with the baby.

Spider-Man, the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] later fight Doctor Octopus and his macro-octobot army. During that time, he had assembled another version of the Sinister Six consisting of Chameleon (who was posing as Steve Rogers), Electro, Mysterio, Rhino, and Sandman in a plot to slip the macro-octobot army into a military base and detonate them. This was prevented by Spider-Man, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four. After his defeat, Doctor Octopus acknowledges Spider-Man's intellect and no longer considers him as the 'foolish child' he had believed him to be.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #642|647}}

When [[Alistaire Smythe (Earth-616)|Alistaire Smythe]] was having [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Scorpion]], [[Paula Crane (Earth-616)|Fly-Girl]] and some cyborgs attack the launch base where [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]] was, Doctor Octopus was observing the occurrences with a remote Octobot and uses the machine to assist the astronauts on board as part of his heretofore unknown plans.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 653}}

===Ends of the Earth===
As his final master plan, Otto Octavius set in motion a set of events, starting with the announcement to offer the world a chance to stop global warming.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #682}}

Next Doctor Octopus and his Sinister Six planned the theft of the Zero Cannon, (a powerful weapon which changes Earth's gravity field to send specific objects to space), from the group of genius super-villains called [[Intelligencia (Earth-616)|Intelligencia]]. Otto and his group succeeded with Intelligencia down and the Cannon stolen.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #676}}

Later, while disguised as Vice-President of America, [[Albert Gore, Jr. (Earth-616)|Al Gore]], Chameleon tried to accelerate the decision of world's leaders about Otto's earlier request, but was uncovered by Spider-Man, who interrupted the scene along with the Avengers. When the Chameleon was freed, he arrived in the Mediterranean for a meeting with the rest of the team. The Avengers followed them and fought the Sinister Six, but they where all defeated by the villains, save for Electro, who was sent to space by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #683}}

Using an explosion as a distraction, [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]] saved Spider-Man and [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]]. When they tried to get to one of Octavius manufacturing plants of satellites, they defeated Sandman, but Octavius asked for help to all nations, due his position in the matter, to capture Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #684}}

While Spider-Man and his allies continue to disarm Doc Ock's bases, defeating Rhino in the process, they are attacked by S.H.I.E.L.D. forces before they can capture him and are forced to flee. Octavius asked for help of other super villains to watch over his facilities over the world, but even after Spider-Man tracks down the final one, Octavius finally reveals he was going to destroy the world anyways, rather than save it. He activated his Octavian Lens, burning half of the world, including Silver Sable's country, [[Symkaria]]. But this is revealed to be a trick made by Mysterio (only burning a small portion of a city in Symkaria), while Chameleon uses a robot to fight Spider-Man, after they are defeated, Mysterio is convinced by Spider-Man to help him to catch Doctor Octopus in his base in [[Guatemala]], but Octavius used the mind-controlled Avengers as his new Sinister Six.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #686}}

Spider-Man, Sable and Widow managed to defeat the Avengers, then he and Sable headed to Octavius underwater base. They are faced by Rhino while the base starts to flood, he trapped Sable and left Spider-Man with two choices, to continue to fight him in order to save Sable from drowning (but Octavius would activate the lenses) or let him drown himself and Sable but stop Octopus. After leaving Sable to her death at her request, Spidey faced the Doctor in battle, and managed to destroy Octavius' arms and equipment before taking his foe away for medical assistance.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #687}}

===Dying Wish===
Using a brain-swapping Octobot, Otto Octavius transplanted his mind into the body of his nemesis Spider-Man. He retained all of Peter's memories, and thus was able to fool all of Peter's family and friends, from [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]] and Aunt May to the Avengers. Peter's mind, meanwhile, was placed into Octavius' dying body.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #698}}
[[File:Otto Octavius (Earth-616) and Peter Parker (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 700 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]
After realizing Peter, in Doc Ock's body, escaped the [[Raft]], Otto decided to keep every person Peter knew in a safe room in the [[Stark Tower]] and waited for Doctor Octopus alone there, by distracting the other Avengers with giant Octobots around the globe, knowing that Peter would seek for help from [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]. Both enemies battled until both fell from the Tower into the ground, fatally wounding Peter (Otto's body). When Peter tried to use the brain-swapping Octobot, Otto revealed him that he was using a [[Carbonadium]] helmet, making his brain totally inaccessible for changing brains. Otto declared his final victory against Parker by giving him a lethal punch which caused "Doctor Octopus" to give his last breaths.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #699}}

Both then discovered that the Octobot managed to connect their minds although it could not swap them, and Peter forced Otto to relive his most suffering experiences and memories as Spider-Man, making him realize the responsibility his power came with. Otto told Peter he not wanted this, but they could not change bodies back. Finally, Otto promised Peter to continue his legacy both as Spider-Man and Peter Parker. Later, he not only realized he could become a better Spider-Man, but also a better man than who he once was as Doctor Octopus, to become a superior Spider-Man to Peter Parker.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #700}}

===Superior Spider-Man===
====Becoming a hero====
After Peter Parker died" Otto Octavius became the new "Superior" Spider-Man. One of his first actions, after upgrading the spider suit with computerized lenses, was to break into an old base which he had established during his time as Doctor Octopus. The base's defenses were coded to his original DNA, which he no longer possessed due to the body swap, and identified him as an intruder. It was during this battle that he had an epiphany that no matter how brilliant he had believed himself to be, Peter Parker had always defeated him. Spider-Man had always thwarted Doc Ock. Destroying his creations, Otto left the base and fully embraced his new role as Spider-Man.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #15.1}}

[[File:Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 1 Camuncoli Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Superior]]
After defeating the new Sinister Six,{{r|Superior Spider-Man #1}} and the returned Vulture, with numerous of Peter's friends noticing changes in "Peter"'s behavior, Octavius decided to become more efficient and utilized thousands of [[Spider-Bots]] to patrol the city thereby getting to crimes that Peter never could in his life.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #3}} Otto also enrolled at the [[Empire State University]] to get his (Peter's) doctorate.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #4}} As Peter he met [[Anna Maria Marconi (Earth-616)|Anna Maria Marconi]], who offered to tutor Peter. Otto was initially annoyed that she thought he needed assistance but Anna not only surprised Otto with her intellect, he found himself falling in love with her, feelings mirrored by the young woman.

During his time as Spider-Man, Otto shattered Scorpion's jaw, blinded the Vulture and killed the mass-murderer [[Marcus Lyman (Earth-616)|Massacre]].{{r|Superior Spider-Man #5}} He also performed numerous involuntary acts, like stopping himself from killing [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]].{{r|Superior Spider-Man #1}} When the Avengers decided to examine Spider-Man to find a reason for his change of behavior,{{r|Superior Spider-Man #7}} they couldn't find anything. Otto attempted to use a neurolotic scanner to determine the source of several spasms his body was experiencing, that [[Elias Wirtham (Earth-616)|Dr. Elias Wirtham]], aka Cardiac also needed. After agreeing to help Cardiac in surgery Otto could take the scanner with him. Afraid of his own discovery, Peter Parker almost prevented Otto from completing his surgery on a wounded little girl, which would have major consequences. After obtaining the scanner, Otto spotted a strange anomaly in his brain, and knew what it was: Peter Parker.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #8}}

Otto figured out that Peter's consciousness was alive in his brain, and to his shock, Otto could now hear Peter inside his mind and decided to put an end to him once and for all.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #8}} Using a neurolitic scanner Otto started a mind-wipe, and finally managed to wipe Parker after dealing with him directly, by plunging himself into his brain. In the split-second of surgery, the moment Peter was truly selfish, that could give Otto the power to convince Peter of his own superiority, and finally Peter Parker was gone, or so, Otto thought.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #9}}

Following the expel of Parker, Octavius helped [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|Mayor Jameson]] assist the execution of Alistair Smythe,{{r|Superior Spider-Man #11}} and even though Smythe managed to temporarily take over the Raft,{{r|Superior Spider-Man #12}} Otto managed to defeat his allies, Vulture, Boomerang and Scorpion and kill the villain, secretly taking the Vulture captive himself. During the conflict, Jameson ordered Spider-Man to execute Smythe when he had escaped, using this evidence to blackmail Jameson, Spider-Man forced the Mayor to allow the Raft become his new headquarters renamed "Spider-Island 2". With new foundations in which to build his own legacy, Octavius formed his own group of minions, the [[Spiderlings (Earth-616)|Spiderlings]], and created giant Spider-Mechs,{{r|Superior Spider-Man #13}} and being one of Otto's newest measures the destruction of [[Shadowland]].{{r|Superior Spider-Man #14}} Unknown to him, a new group of organized crime was being built by the hand of a new villain, the Goblin King.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #16}}

====[[Spider-Verse]]====
[[File:Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 32 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Lost in 2099]]
During the period where Otto went missing in [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon Labs]], he was transported to the [[Earth-928|year 2099 in an alternate universe]]. Whilst there, he was attacked by the [[Public Eye (Earth-928)|Public Eye]], until he was rescued by [[Gabriel O'Hara (Earth-928)|Gabe O'Hara]]. Otto then settled into [[Miguel O'Hara (Earth-928)|Miguel O'Hara]]'s old flat and programmed an AI in the form of Anna Maria. He decided to return to the present, and to do so by stealing equipment from [[Stark-Fujikawa (Earth-928)|Stark-Fujikawa]] and [[Alchemax (Earth-928)|Alchemax]] (finding it amusing that Stark abided by the law whilst Alchemax sent everyone after him). When he attempted travels back in time, he does so but instead traveled to parallel universes, one with a recently deceased Spider-Man, including one where he found a [[Peter Parker (Earth-772)|Spider-Man]] who was part of the [[Fantastic Five (Earth-772)|Fantastic Four]] (now Five), [[Peter Parker (Earth-10919)|one]] still reconciling with the [[Superhuman Registration Act|Superhero Registration Act]], [[Peter Parker (Earth-58163)|one]] living in the House of M reality as a famous mutant and [[Peter Parker (Earth-14132)|another Spider-Man]] in a black iron clad armored-like suit, are all killed by a being with a unique, exotic energy source. Otto realized that someone was killing each universe's Spider-Man and so traveled to different universes. He eventually traveled to a universe with an [[Paviitr Prabhakar (Earth-50101)|Indian Spider-Man]] who was under attack by the being killing all the different [[Superior Spider-Army (Earth-928)|Spider-Men]], saving him and escaping back to 2099, revealing that Otto had already recruited several other Spider-Men, including [[Peter Parker (Earth-8101)|Spider-Monkey]], [[Peter Parker (Earth-90214)|Spider-Man Noir]], [[Peter Parker (Earth-92100)|Six-Armed Spider-Man]], and [[Ashley Barton (Earth-807128)|Spider-Girl]]. He next found and rescued a [[Peter Parker (Earth-8351)|Spidey]] who left New York City and joined the [[James Howlett (Earth-8351)|Wolverine]] in [[Russia]], and recruited him to join in fighting back against the being hunting Spider-Men before they both escaped back to 2099.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #32}}

Over time, Otto would gather an army of Spider-Man across the [[Multiverse]] against [[Karn (Earth-001)|Karn]] and other [[Inheritors (Earth-001)|similar hunters]]. His own team met up with a second Spider-Men team, which included Peter Parker from [[Earth-616]]. When informed of the existence of the [[Spider-Totems]] by [[Ezekiel Sims (Earth-4)|Ezekiel Sims]], Otto dismissed the notion of supernatural beings as a backwards superstition. When [[Daemos (Earth-001)|Daemos]] attacked, drawn to the presence of the [[Other (Spider-Totem) (Multiverse)|Other]] and the [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Bride]], two powerful Spider-Totems, Otto engaged in combat with Daemos and killed him. That turned out to be a clone, and the Spiders were forced to split up and flee when Daemos returned with reinforcements, killing several members of Otto's team. Afterwards, Otto declared that they were at war with the Inheritors and that he was now the leader of the Spiders, no questions asked.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 10}}

The Peter Parker from Earth-616 challenged his authority, stating that he had been named leader due to having fought the Inheritors before. Otto mocked Peter and received a punch to the face for his arrogance. The Superior and Amazing Spider-Men fought until Otto revealed that he believed Peter to be from before his takeover, which Peter exploited by surrendering and challenging Otto to prove his superiority by killing him. Otto refused, as he believed killing Peter would jeopardize his existence, and Peter defeated him with a single blow. To Otto's surprise, Peter helped him to his feet, admitting that he would need Otto's expertise and advice for the coming battle. Accepting his role as adviser, Otto suggested the Spider-Totems move from [[Central Park]] into the city, but was opposed by [[Tamara Devoux (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]], who stated they were safe as long as he was around. When Peter left with an away team to give a cloaking device to the injured Spider-Man Noir and gather more recruits, Otto half-jokingly challenged [[William Braddock (Earth-833)|Spider-UK]] - who Peter had placed in charge until his return - to a fight for the position.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 11}}

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 10 Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]
After Captain Universe and [[Takuya Yamashiro (Earth-51778)|Japanese Spider-Man]] tried their best against Inheritors' leader, [[Solus (Earth-001)|Solus]], but failed, the [[Spider-Army (Multiverse)|Spider-Army]] relocated to [[Earth-3145]] where they found that reality's Spider-Man, [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-3145)|Ben Parker]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 12}} Otto was aghast that Earth-3145's [[Otto Octavius (Earth-3145)|Doctor Octopus]] was responsible for the desolation of that world, and when Peter made a comment regarding his holographic assistant's resemblance to Anna Maria, Otto realized that Peter was from later in Earth-616's timeline and therefore that he loses everything. When Peter failed to convince Uncle Ben to wear his costume one last time, Otto berated Ben for giving up and letting his world fall to ruin, convincing the old man to suit up one more time.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 13}}

During the final battle against the Inheritors, Otto tried to take on Daemos, but had two of his mechanical legs ripped off. When [[Morlun (Earth-001)|Morlun]] sneered that Peter returning [[Benjamin Richard Parker (Earth-982)|Benjy]] to [[Earth-982]] was only prolonging the inevitable, Otto proclaimed that he had found a "superior solution" that Peter and the other Spiders were too blind and gutless to see, slitting the Master Weaver's throat to Morlun's and Peter's mutual horror. After the Inheritors were defeated, Otto overheard Miguel O'Hara state that the [[Web of Life and Destiny]] could be used to return them to their proper universes and times.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 14}} He proceeded to attack the Web, refusing to return to a world knowing the destiny it had in store for him, but even as the other Spiders returned to their worlds, the Spiders of Earth-616 banded together to oppose him, Peter proclaiming that Otto lost because he acknowledged that Peter was superior. With Karn agreeing to act as the Master Weaver- with the deceased Weaver apparently being his own future self- Otto was resigned to return to his home time with his memories of this battle erased, although he left instructions for "[[Anna Maria Marconi (A.I.) (Earth-928)|Anna]]" to reactivate in a hundred days.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 15}}

====Superior Venom====
After a brief fight with [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]], during which Octavius discovered that Flash Thompson was behind the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|symbiote]],{{r|Superior Spider-Man #22}} Flash sought Peter's help in giving him a place to stay. Octavius eventually convinced Flash to allow him to perform a procedure that would give him robotic leg implants, though during the procedure he forcefully removed the symbiote from Flash. The symbiote, feeling isolated and scared, broke out of containment and bonded to Octavius, creating a "Superior Venom".{{r|Superior Spider-Man #23}}

Despite claiming to be able to exert full control over a reluctant Venom symbiote, Otto became even more erratic than usual: he wounded Cardiac and fled, hoping to find a villain to physically overpower, proving his new-found might. Failing to do so, he started beating up and scaring petty criminals, until Anna Maria called him to be consoled, having been hurt over insensitive remarks Aunt May had made regarding her height. This prompted "Peter" to storm Aunt May's home, loudly berating her for her actions, then directing his anger towards MJ, guilty of having taken May's side. As soon as MJ tried to counter his anger, Otto was informed that some of the [[Roderick Kingsley (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]]'s minions were robbing a bank and summoned the Venom symbiote, leaving while warning his former family to stay away from him.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #24}}

[[File:Otto Octvaius (Earth-616), Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616), and Spiderlings (Earth-616) vs. Avengers (Earth-616) from Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 25 001.png|thumb|right|Superior Venom goes to war against the Avengers]]
After almost killing two of the robbers, Venom was confronted by the Avengers, who with the aid of Flash Thompson clad in an [[Iron Man Armor]] managed to defeat Octavius. Octavius realized that the symbiote had been eroding his control and it abruptly took over him, lashing out at Flash when he tried to convince it to return to him. Otto tried to cast the symbiote out but failed, prompting Peter Parker's consciousness to return to help him purge it before retreating back under the radar. Back as Spider-Man, Otto lied to the Avengers and Mary Jane that his behaviour in the past months was due to microscopic fragments of the symbiote slowly multiplying within him. When the Avengers talked to Tony Stark about the test they previously conducted on Spider-Man and found nothing, Stark decided to check the data further, and discovered that all of it except the one he knew about had been erased by Spider-Man. With this in mind, Captain America proclaimed that they would need to bring Spider-Man in.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #25}} After being confronted by the Avengers once more because of the missing medial scans, Otto escaped.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #26}}

===[[Goblin Nation (Storyline)|Goblin Nation]]===
[[File:Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 27.NOW Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]
31 days later, Otto is surveying the city of New York, having it come under siege by the [[Goblin Nation (Earth-616)|Goblin Underground]]. He realizes that he had been chasing the wrong goblins all this while, and that it was the Green Goblin that was behind everything that had transpired. Back at his apartment, Otto is troubled over how the Green Goblin managed to hack into his Spider-Bots, when Anna Maria comes in, concerned about him neglecting his health and employees at [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]].

During their conversation when Anna brings up the word "recognize," Otto has a brainwave, and attempts to call [[Uatu Jackson (Earth-616)|Uatu Jackson]] about his facial recognition software, only to be ignored, forcing him to visit Jackson as Spider-Man, where the two discuss about the hacking. Otto then heads underground to locate the source of the transmission, and runs straight into the Goblin King and his henchmen. To Otto's surprise, the Goblin King sends off his henchmen, and talks with Otto, revealing that he knew of his true identity all along, shocking Otto.

The Goblin King then offers Otto a partnership with the latter as his second. Enraged, Otto refuses and swears to liberate New York from his grip. Laughing, the Goblin King zaps Otto, only to realize that it was only a hologram that Otto projected of himself. The Goblin King then gives the command to destroy Spider-Island.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #27.NOW}}

Otto is confused why the Goblin Army managed to get past his security grid. As the Goblin King mocks him, the [[Living Brain (Earth-616)|Living Brain]] shields him from a blast. Otto notes with dismay that one of his favorite Spiderlings have been killed. Ordering a strategic retreat, Otto himself flees Spider-Island on the Living Brain, and goes underwater to avoid pursuit.

Getting back to Parker Industries, Otto met [[Sajani Jaffrey (Earth-616)|Sajani]], who berates him for his absence. Just then, [[Yuriko Watanabe (Earth-616)|Wraith]] drops in and demands answers about Carlie from Otto, when Monster interrupts and knocks out Wraith, surprising Otto with her true identity. Otto and Sajani flee inside the facility, where Otto tells Sajani to split up. Cornering Monster, Otto's kick destroys her earpiece, preventing the Green Goblin from listening in. Monster pleads with Otto to use his brains to resolve the situation before the Green Goblin's plans are realized. While all this is happening, Otto is unaware that Anna has been kidnapped by Menace.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #28}}

Otto, in his lab, makes a call to Mary Jane, telling her to stay safe. When Mary Jane mentions that Aunt May is stressing out, Otto tells her to deal with the situation before cutting off the conversation. He resumes his study on Monster, now restrained, in an attempt to cure her of the Goblin Serum without killing her, when suddenly, the Goblin King contacts him, telling him to put on his suit, and promises to show him interesting things. When Otto does so, the Goblin King projects images of the places he blows up one by one, including the house where Otto grew up, to the [[Hospital for Emergency Aid and Recuperative Therapy (Earth-616)|H.E.A.R.T clinic]].

Otto swears to kill the Goblin King, but the latter threatens Otto with the life of Anna Maria if he does not comply with his demands of heading to Empire State University, prompting Otto to think about how Peter Parker would have resolved this crisis. He quickly swings his way to the university, where he finds the captive to be [[Donald Lamaze (Earth-616)|Don Lamaze]]. Otto dismisses this as a joke, when the Goblin King attempts to flee.

Unleashing his mechanical arms, Otto starts to attack, only to find that the Goblin King had hacked into his arms as well, causing them to strike at him instead. As the Goblin King makes his exit, Otto struggles with his arms, telling Lamaze to flee. However, when a stray arm threatens to strike at Otto's neck, Lamaze takes the fatal blow meant for Otto. With his dying breaths, Lamaze states that he helped Spider-Man as he had helped him and Anna when [[Angelina Brancale (Earth-616)|Stunner]] attacked, and in the process showed him what a true hero really was. Otto cradles Lamaze in his arms as the latter dies.

Swearing to find the Goblin King, Otto's Spider-Sense goes off, and he is confronted by the new [[Spider-Slayer Mark XXI|Spider-Slayers]]. Jameson, projecting his voice, declares that he will kill Spider-Man, much to Otto's shock. When Otto is pinned by one of them, he is saved by the arrival of Spider-Man 2099, who deactivated them with a remote. Otto is questioned by him regarding his actions of late, but before anything can happen, the Spider-Slayers are reactivated by the Goblin King, who has hacked into their systems as well, and promptly grab both Spider-Men by the head.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #29}}

====Superior No More and Death====
[[File:Peter Parker (Earth-616), Otto Octavius (Earth-616), and Anna Maria Marconi (Earth-616) from Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 30 001.jpg|thumb|right|Otto entrusts the mission of saving Anna to Peter]]
The Goblin King revealed Otto he had taken Anna Maria hostage, and he promptly started looking for her. Spider-Man was deceived by Menace into going to the subway, as she made him believe Maria was there. In the subway he found himself with the decision to save a young child, revealed to be [[Amy Chen (Earth-616)|Amy Chen]]. Otto hesitated, as there was a chance that by saving Amy he would injure himself and fail to get back in the search for Maria. The consciousness of Peter Parker revealed his survival by pushing Otto into saving the child, as there was no time for planning but just doing what was right. Otto realized he had failed as a "superior" Spider-Man and decided Peter should take the control of his body back, as he could save Maria and stop the Goblin. Octavius arrived to what was left of Parker Industries and proceeded to erase his consciousness with the neurolitic scanner and let Peter Parker live fully once again, but in doing so, sacrificed himself for the girl he loved and the man he hated.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #30}}

===The Return of Doc Ock===
[[File:Otto Octavius (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|As the [[Living Brain (Earth-616)|Living Brain]].]]
During [[Spider-Verse|the battle]] against the [[Inheritors (Earth-001)|Inheritors]], upon discovering he was fated to die once he returned to his proper place in the past of [[Earth-616|his timeline]], Otto Octavius used the technology he had acquired in [[Earth-928|2099]] to house a copy of his consciousness inside his gauntlets and programmed [[Anna Maria Marconi (A.I.) (Earth-928)|Anna's A.I.]] to enter sleep mode for one hundred days.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 18}}

One hundred days later, when [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]] collapsed,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 18}} Anna's A.I. reactivated and activated Otto's back-up consciousness, who then proceed to merge the gauntlets into an [[Octobot]], its mission being to regain control over Peter Parker's body, which he considered to be perfect. Fearing Parker would cast him out of his body again, Otto decided to house himself inside the [[Living Brain (Earth-616)|Living Brain]] instead, and to wait for the right time to act.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 18}} Over the next several months, Otto worked for Peter Parker while plotting against him and his company whenever he had the chance.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 1|2}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 5}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 9|11}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 16}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 18}}

When Parker decided to take a look at the Living Brain to see if there was any problem with it, Otto asked him how his former self's mind had been erased, and went on a rampage after being told that he had sacrificed himself in order to give Peter full control over his own body to defeat the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Goblin King]], forcing Peter to shut the Living Brain down. However, Otto managed to activate the robot's self-destruction and escape through his Octobot body.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 18}}

As he believed Peter's body had somehow damaged his former self's mind, Otto gave up the idea of stealing it again and decided to get his biological body back by cloning and perfecting it, using [[New U Technologies (Earth-616)|New U Technologies]]' cloning procedure to do so.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 18}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 20}} But when he arrived at Potter's Field Cemetery to acquire the genetic material he needed from his corpse, Otto found out it had been stolen, which led him to investigate the graves of other criminals related to Spider-Man, such as the [[Alistaire Smythe (Earth-616)|Spider-Slayer]], and discover that the corpses had also been stolen.

[[File:Otto Octavius (Duplicate) (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 20 002.jpg|thumb|215px|Dead no more.]]
Accessing the web, Otto discovered New U Technologies was behind the disappearance of the bodies, as he had suspected, and secretly arranged for his former self's body to be delivered to New U Headquarters, where it was cloned. As the consciousness inhabiting Doctor Octopus' body at the time of its death was that of Spider-Man, [[Peter Parker (New U Duplicate) (Earth-616)|a copy of Peter Parker's consciousness]] was created along with the cloned body, forcing Otto to fight and kill it in order to take control over the new body. Once he emerged from the vat the clone was inside, Otto had [[Doctor Octopus' Tentacles|his tentacles]] returned to him by the [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Jackal]], who was secretly the owner of New U Technologies, and became Doctor Octopus once again. Doctor Octopus later allied himself with the Jackal to help him solve the problem in his cloning process in exchange for [[New U Pills|the pills]] that would prevent his body from breaking down.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 20}}

===[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy|Dead No More]]===
When Peter Parker infiltrated New U Headquarters as Spider-Man to uncover the truth behind its cloning procedure, Doctor Octopus ambushed him{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 1}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 20}} and revealed the truth about himself to him, as well as his involvement with Parker Industries as the Living Brain. Having insulated himself from Spider-Man's new webbing types, Otto easily defeated Spider-Man but was stopped from finishing him off by the arrival of the Jackal, who forced him to stand down.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 2}}

When [[Hector Cervantez (Earth-616)|Spectro]] infiltrated New U in order to help his girlfriend [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Silk]] uncover what was going on, Doctor Octopus captured him and conducted an experiment on him, implanting his ghost into a cloned body.{{r|Silk Vol 2 15}}

Using the Jackal's cloning technology, Otto began to work on a project he termed the "Proto Clone," splicing his own genetic material with Spider-Man's to create a hybrid body into which he planned to transfer his consciousness.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 3}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 25}} The Jackal attempted to make him put the project on hold so that they could relocate to a new location after Spider-Man and [[Gwendolyn Stacy (Earth-65)|Spider-Gwen]] infiltrated the facility; but Otto refused, suggesting the Jackal just kill and resurrect them.<!-- {{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 4}} -->

Following the capture of [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]], Otto began to work with the Lizard to ensure the Proto Clone would not succumb to [[Carrion Virus|the cellular degeneration]] that the other New U clones and Kaine suffered from, dismissing Connors' suggestion of a possible cure. Puzzling over Kaine's resilience in comparison to himself or [[Francine Frye (Earth-616)|Electro]], he recognized Kaine's interdimensional transporter from his time in the Spider-Army, but was interrupted when [[Anna Maria Marconi (Earth-616)|Anna Maria]] was brought in. To Otto's dismay she was disgusted and enraged with him, making him wonder if she would have preferred if he had come back in a cloned body of Spider-Man. Realizing that the New U facility's shielding was slowing the clones' degeneration by blocking out certain frequencies, Otto and Anna Maria theorized that they could isolate the signals to either stop or accelerate the degenerative process.<!-- {{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 4}} -->

The Jackal interrupted their research, and Otto explained that they had managed to isolate a frequency that accelerated the degeneration. However, when the Jackal insulted Anna Maria's height, Otto attacked him and discovered that the Jackal was a [[Spider-Clone]]. Furious at having been tricked, Otto broadcast the signal to trigger the clones' degeneration. When the Jackal started to broadcast the signal worldwide,{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 4}} Otto continued to fight him even as their bodies began to break down. When Spider-Man arrived, he and Anna began work on isolating the signal to counteract the degeneration while Otto kept the Jackal (unmasked as Ben Reilly) occupied. Otto asked why Spider-Man would trust him, causing Peter to respond that he had been inside Otto's head and knew he was not all-bad. When the counter-signal was broadcast, Otto shattered Ben's [[Webware]], telling him they'd die together.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 5}}

Realizing the Proto Clone was immune to the degeneration, Ben attempted to transfer his mind into it only to be electrocuted - a precaution that Otto had put in place. Otto transferred his consciousness into the Proto Clone, leaving his cloned body to decay into dust.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 24}}

Later, Otto hitched a ride to one of his old bases only to learn it had been appropriated by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] in his absence. Furious over this and Peter's mismanagement of Parker Industries, Otto easily defeated the intruders but was approached by [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]], who offered an alliance in order to take down Parker Industries. Accepting to gain access to Hydra's manpower and resources, Otto constructed new and upgraded tentacles as well as a [[Superior Octopus' Suit|new suit]] patterned after his [[Superior Spider-Man's Suit|Superior Spider-Man costume]], rebranding himself as the Superior Octopus.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 25}}

Shortly before Hydra launched its conquest of the [[United States of America|United States]], the Superior Octopus arranged a meeting with Spider-Man where he revealed his new identity to him and tried to convince him to relinquish control of Parker Industries. When Peter Parker refused the deal, the Superior Octopus had Hydra agents blow up the [[Parker Industries Building (London)|London branch of Parker Industries]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 29}} Superior Octopus made plans to also destroy the [[Parker Industries Building (Shanghai)|Shanghai branch of Parker Industries]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 30}} but Octavius was ultimately foiled when Peter had those at Shanghai destroy everything in the building, obliterating the Webware technology and ultimately taking down Parker Industries itself. Octavius used an EMP to destroy the [[Spider-Armor MK IV]], only to be confronted with Spider-Man in [[Spider-Man's Suit|his original costume]]. Spider-Man turned the tables on Octavius and short-circuited his tentacles, forcing him to retreat, losing his arms and mask in the process.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 31}}

By the time Hydra had taken over the nation, the Superior Octopus became a member of [[Avengers (Hydra) (Earth-616)|Hydra's own Avengers]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} Otto was present during the final battle between Hydra and the resistance in [[Washington, D.C.]], but fell when his fellow teammate [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Odinson]] turned against Hydra's Avengers.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}}

====[[Go Down Swinging]]====
[[File:Otto Octavius (Duplicate) (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800 001.png|thumb|left|250px|Otto under the alias of "Elliot Tolliver."]]
After Norman Osborn became the Red Goblin by bonding with the [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage symbiote]], he infected his grandson [[Norman Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Normie Osborn]] with it and sent him to kill [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|May Reilly]] in order to emotionally hurt Spider-Man. Octopus still possessed Parker's memories and they motivated him to protect May from Normie. He was aided by [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]] with [[Spider-Slayer Mark V|a remotely-piloted Spider-Slayer]], though Jameson initially thought Octopus was a partner of Osborn. When Osborn arrived to retrieve Normie, he took both Octopus and the Spider-Slayer out and attempted to kill May with a barrage of darts, but Octopus jumped in front of them. After being healed by [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Anti-Venom]], Octopus assumed the alias of "Elliot Tolliver" and went on to work for [[Horizon University (Earth-616)|Horizon University]], where Anna Marconi (who noticed something familiar about him) was also working. With its technology, Otto intended to reclaim his title as the [[Superior Spider-Man]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800}}

===Superior Spider-Man in San Francisco===
====[[Spider-Geddon]]====
Combining the [[Miles Warren (Earth-616)|Jackal]]'s and [[Jennix (Earth-001)|Jennix]]'s cloning technology, Otto created a set of duplicate bodies he could upload his conscious into should his current body be killed.{{r|Superior Octopus Vol 1 1}} The [[Web-Warriors (Earth-001)|Web-Warriors]] and [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Ultimate Spider-Man]] attacked his lab to destroy them - fearing the Inheritors could use them to escape their prison - Otto fought them, smugly stating that was impossible and that they should have killed the Inheritors like he'd suggested in the first place. The Web-Warriors' fears were confirmed when Otto's system was confirmed to have been hacked by Jennix, who created new bodies for himself, Morlun, and Verna. Otto was nearly consumed by Jennix, who tossed him aside when he realized he wasn't a pure Spider-Totem.{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 1}}

[[Octavia Otto (Earth-1104)|Octavia Otto]], a female counterpart of Otto from [[Earth-1104|another Earth]], programmed Otto's lab to explode in order to destroy the cloning tubes. Unfortunately, during the battle, [[Verna (Earth-001)|Verna]] acquired Gwen's dimensional travel watch, trapping her in another dimension and assembling [[Inheritors (Earth-001)|her family]]. The remaining spiders returned to Karn, arguing what to do with the Inheritors, dividing opinions and causing a discussion. However, Karn suggested to stop wasting time arguing and get other spiders to fight the Inheritors. With his costume damaged, Otto returned to his lab with Octavia and Spider-Punk, and changed to a replica of the second version of the [[Superior Spider-Man's Suit]]. Returning to his Superior Spider-Man identity, Otto recruited Kaine, presuming that he still possessed [[Other (Spider-Totem) (Multiverse)|the Other]], who informed the former that he did not. Kaine suggested they also recruit Ben Reilly, but Otto refused. They go back to his lab, unaware that Ben swung through the portal.{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 2}}

Later, Otto recruited the [[Peter Parker (Earth-1048)|Spider-Man]] of [[Earth-1048]], defeating the villain [[Anton Miguel Rodriquez (Earth-1048)|Tarantula]] in the process. For unknown reasons, he left a [[Spider-Bots|Spider-Bot]] in that Earth when learning of the status of that world's [[Otto Octavius (Earth-1048)|Otto Octavius]].{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 0}} Otto and Peter later recruited the [[Takuya Yamashiro (Earth-51778)|Spider-Man]] of [[Earth-51778]]. When his team was all assembled, Ben Reilly, the former Jackal, revealed himself to them and offered his help. Though he declined at first, Otto realized he could help a lot since he created the cloning tubes the Inheritors are using. Miles contacted them and said his team was planning an attack, forcing some of the Superior Spider-Army's Spider-People to rescue them.{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 3}}

[[File:Spider-Geddon Vol 1 4 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Otto "sacrificing" Ben.]]
They managed to retreat to their base, with [[Norman Osborn (Earth-44145)|Spider-Man]], an alternate spider-version of Norman Osborn from [[Earth-44145]], having a discussion with Otto, suggesting he take over the leadership. Their disagreement led Norman and [[Spiders-Man (Earth-11580)|Spiders-Man]] to separate from the group; however, Norman destroyed the [[Web of Life and Destiny]] to leave the Inheritors trapped in Earth-616. When the Inheritors retrieved the crystal containing [[Solus (Earth-001)|Solus]]' soul, since they planned to use the Jackal's cloning technology to revive their father, but couldn't do it without the crystal. After his resurrection, Otto would give Ben to Jennix feast on him in order to acquire his knowledge about the cloning tubes.{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 4}}

However, this was just a plan to destroy Jennix's "maniacal mind" since he was forced to see through Ben's point of view all the times he died and was resurrected. Fortunately, shortly after realizing his plan, the Spider-People appeared, with Miles Morales now with the power of the [[Glossary:Enigma Force|Enigma Force]]. Otto revived Ben, and later, Peter arrived and decided to lend the leadership to Otto, meaning Miles killing Solus with Earth-51778's Spider-Man's sword vigor. After realizing Solus put the hunger in his sons, they decided to create new clone baby bodies to the Inheritors, without their hunger and their past life memory, who would later be adopted by [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-3123)|Spider-Ma'am]].{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 5}}

====Return to Heroics====
[[File:Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 2 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|The Superior Spider-Man faces Terrax the Tamer.]]
Otto as Spider-Man defeated [[Wilbur Day (Earth-616)|Stilt-Man]] on his way to deliver a speech as Elliot Tolliver at [[Horizon University (Location)|Horizon University]] and afterwards reflected on his past. Later in the evening he met up with [[Night Shift (Earth-616)|Night Shift]] members [[Roderick Krupp (Earth-616)|Digger]] and [[Dansen Macabre (Earth-616)|Dansen Macabre]] to defeat a cult dedicated to [[Martin Preston (Earth-616)|Master Pandemonium]]. The next day he was confronted at Horizon by Anna Maria, who had deduced he was actually Otto Octavius and not really Elliot Tolliver. She was going to turn him over to the [[San Francisco Police Department (Earth-616)|police]], but changed her mind when [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax the Tamer]] attacked [[San Francisco]].{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 1}} The Superior Spider-Man confronted Terrax alongside the Night Shift, but was abandoned by his allies when Digger was bisected. He continued to fight a losing battle while Anna Maria built and delivered an [[Inductors]] device that allowed him to drain some of Terrax's [[Power Cosmic]].{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 2}} Spider-Man reentered the battle infused with cosmic energy, but Terrax was still more skilled in its use. The former [[Heralds of Galactus (Earth-616)|Herald]] was eventually defeated when Otto and Anna work together to reprogram [[Terrax's Axe]] to backfire on him. After the battle, Anna agreed to allow Otto to continue his hero career, but only if she were his chaperone.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 3}}

At the urging of Anna, Otto participated in the disaster relief in San Francisco as the Superior Spider-Man. Throughout the course of the day he began to realize the value of civilians through his different interactions. Afterwards he was invited on a date by [[Emma Hernandez (Earth-616)|Emma Hernandez]] and agreed.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 4}} Otto's date with Emma went well until he revealed his true identity, which caused her to flee from his apartment. He followed her as Spider-Man and they were confronted by police officers possessed by Master Pandemonium's [[Demons|demons]] and Emma was possessed as well. Otto contacted [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] for aid, who initially attacked him before being shown the demonic infestation. By combining their efforts they were able to track down and confront Master Pandemonium.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 5}} The pair of doctors ended up defeating Pandemonium by swapping equipment, but Strange refused to wipe Emma's memory for him afterwards; however, Anna Maria helped him convince Emma to keep his identity a secret because he had saved her.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 6}}

====[[War of the Realms]]====
When [[Frost Giants]] invaded San Francisco, Superior Spider-Man saved its citizens by transferring them into a limbo state using experimental technology. He then decided to team up with the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]] in order to make use of [[America Chavez (Earth-616)|Ms. America]]'s abilities. After he rescued them in [[Los Angeles]] using his [[Octavian Lens]], he managed to convince them of his plan to stop the war at its source in the [[Asgard (Realm)|Asgardian Realms]]; however, they needed to travel to [[New York City]] to find a way there, as magic was interfering with Ms. America's powers.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 7}} They arrived amidst a battle between the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] and [[Malekith (Earth-616)|Malekith]]'s forces where Otto was able to work with [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] to develop a way to allow Ms. America to duplicate the energies of the [[Bifrost]]. They failed to locate the [[Svartalfheim]] strike team so they moved on to the [[Jotunheim]] [[Jotunheim Strikeforce (Earth-616)|Strikeforce]], who convinced Otto to trust them and focus on protecting [[Earth|Midgard]]. He then returned to New York to protect its citizens alongside the West Coast Avengers.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 8}}{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 9}}{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 10}}

===Doctor Octopus Once More===
Targeted by the Norman Osborn Spider-Man of Earth-44145, who sought to destroy Otto's life in revenge for having insulted him during the second Totem War, Otto was approached by [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]], who offered him a way to defeat Norman.{{r|{{cl|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 9}}-[[Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 10|10]]}} Despite Anna Maria begging him not to throw away the good inside himself, Otto accepted Mephisto's bargain and was restored to his original body and state of mind from before he ever mind-swapped with Peter Parker.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 11}} [[Otto Octavius (Clones) (Earth-616)|A spare cloned body]] was used as a decoy to fool Norman, and later buried as Elliot Tolliver.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 12}}

[[File:Otto Octavius (Duplicate) (Earth-616) from Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 12 001.jpg|thumb|Return to villainy]]

As is typical with Mephisto, the details of this deal are somewhat confusing. Otto has seemingly lost all of Peter Parker's memories, but retained all of the ones since he was duplicated after the battle against the Inheritors. For instance, though Otto did not remember Peter's identity or the events from the first time he was the Superior Spider-Man, he remembered his alliance with the Jackal through the War of the Realms, and people such as Anna Maria, from the New U crisis to the present. This also meant that while he remembered being a hero, he now associated more with villainy, just as he did before the initial mind-swap. The deal also included restoring Otto's body to perfect shape, not only fixing the damage of all fights as Octopus, but also the brain damage he suffered while becoming Octopus — "if any." This suggested that Mephisto was convinced the brain damage was a false excuse and Otto would return to criminal behavior regardless.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 11}}

===Sinister War===
While in a quest to fill the missing gaps in his memory, Otto was forced into the service of the demon [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Kindred]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 64}} Kindred instructed Otto to reform the Sinister Six, for which he recruited Sandman,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 68}} revived Electro,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 69}} and enlisted the new [[Last Son of Kraven (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]].{{r|Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: Chameleon Conspiracy Vol 1 1}} Forcing the [[Isotope Genome Accelerator]] on Dr. Curt Connors, Otto separated the scientist's Lizard side into a [[Lizard (Isotope Genome Accelerator Duplicate) (Earth-616)|separate entity]] for his team. The final member, chosen by Kindred, was Mysterio,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 70}} who the Sinister Six retrieved from the premiere of a film he had directed under a false identity. The team briefly clashed with the [[Savage Six (Kraven's) (Earth-616)|Savage Six]], who had also intercepted the premiere to enact revenge on Mysterio. Spider-Man became involved in the fray, and Octavius knocked him down to deliver him to Kindred, whose torment was the demon's endgame.{{r|Sinister War Vol 1 1}}

[[File:Otto Octavius (Earth-616) from Sinister War Vol 1 4 001.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Doctor Octopus beats all the other teams]]

Doctor Octopus and the Sinister Six were then forced to participate in a hunt for Spider-Man, competing against other teams assembled by Kindred, including the [[Syndicate (Beetle) (Earth-616)|Syndicate]], [[Wild Pack (Earth-616)|Wild Pack]] and the Savage Six.{{r|Sinister War Vol 1 2}} At one point during the battle royale, Doctor Octopus had Spider-Man in his grasp but hesitated to kill him long enough for the Savage Six to interfere, giving Spider-Man the chance to escape.{{r|Sinister War Vol 1 3}} Realizing that Kindred wouldn't give him the answers he seeked, Otto used [[Eric O'Grady (LMD) (Earth-616)|Black Ant]]'s helmet signal to kill the centipedes that Kindred was using to control him and the other villains during the fight, leaving all of them unconscious and saving Spider-Man. The hero thanked him but Otto claimed that he was just getting revenge on Kindred for not going through with their agreement before leaving.{{r|Sinister War Vol 1 4}}

[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 600 Ross Variant Textless.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Doctor Octopus' tentacles]]
'''[[Doctor Octopus' Tentacles|Cybernetic Tentacles]]:''' Doctor Octopus' superhuman abilities derive from the four mentally-controlled, electronically-powered, telescoping, prehensile titanium-steel tentacles attached to a stainless steel harness encircling his body from lower chest to waist. Each tentacle, approximately five inches in diameter, terminates in three single-jointed pincers. The pincers are able to rotate in relation to the arm for 360 degrees, in a screwdriver-like twisting motion. Each tentacle segment contains four high-efficiency electric motors equipped with a clutched, helical-gear train, independently mounted on frictionless gimbals and housed in four thin, overlapping layers of titanium-niobium steel. The titanium-steel alloy is light, has high-tensile strength, a high melting point, and high thin-wall rigidity. The motors get their power from a small nuclear-powered thermo-electric generator, which can provide several hundred watts per hour for up to five years before needing to replace its U-239 core. The tentacles have been modified since the time of the original accident to include high-efficiency battery packs (enabling movement when cut off from the central power source) and individual micro-circuit control modules (enabling each arm to perform certain pre-programmed actions when Octopus loses conscious control). In the event that Octopus loses consciousness, the control module of each arm has enough pre-programmed conditional responses in its memory chip to enable it to perform a relatively complex sequence of actions, such as saving his life. The trauma of his arm or arms being separated from the harness causes a period of disorientation in which his arms flail about uncontrollably until the pre-programming takes over.{{Citation}}
* '''Technopathic Tentacle Manipulation:''' Octopus can control the actions of his artificial arms psionically, even when they have been severed from his body and are separated from him by vast distances (a distance of 900 miles has been recorded).{{Citation}}
* '''Telescoping:''' Each tentacle is approximately six feet long at full contraction, but can extend to a maximum of 24 feet in length.{{Citation}}
* '''Superhuman Striking Force:''' Each tentacle is capable of moving at a speed of ninety feet per second and strike with the force of a jackhammer.{{Citation}}
* '''High-Wind Generation:''' The tentacles can generate 50 mile per hour winds if spun like a giant fan.{{Citation}}
* '''Wall-Climbing and Traveling:''' By combining the intrinsic strength of both his tentacles and the pincers, Doctor Octopus can scale stone, brick, or concrete walls by rending "handholds" in the surface of the wall. Octopus is able to use his tentacles for traversing horizontal distances as well. At full extension, he can travel high above the ground as if on stilts, either using two tentacles, or for maximum speed (approximately 50 miles per hour), four tentacles.{{Citation}}
* '''Sensation Feeling:''' Although there are no nerve endings throughout the length of his artificial arms, Octopus can "feel" basic sensations with them. As a result of the mutagenic changes from exposure to radiation during the accident, electrical connections have been made from his chest harness to his spine. Thus, Doctor Octopus can mentally perceive "tactile" sensations by feeling the amount of electrical resistance that the pincer's electric motors feel when the pincers grasp an object.{{Citation}}
* '''Superhuman Concentration:''' Doctor Octopus possesses extraordinary mental abilities and concentration, and through years of practice is able to perform two complex and two simple independent actions, simultaneously, one with each arm.{{Citation}}

<big>'''As Peter Parker:'''</big> 
'''Spider Physiology:''' After swapping bodies with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], Otto in Peter's body possesses the proportionate powers of a spider. The radioactive, complex mutagenic enzymes in the spider's blood that were transferred at the time of the bite triggered numerous body-wide mutagenic changes within Parker, granting him superhuman strength, speed, toughened flesh, and numerous arachnid-like abilities.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 1}} His powers include:
* '''Wall-Crawling:''' Spider-Man's exposure to the mutated spider venom induced a mutagenic, cerebellum-wide alteration of his engrams resulting in the ability to mentally control the flux of intermolecular attraction between atomic boundary layers. This overcomes the outer electron shell's normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail. The mentally controlled sub-atomic particle responsible for this has yet to be identified. This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to Spider-Man's body (especially concentrated in his hands and feet) and another object, with an upper limit of several tons per finger.{{Citation}}
[[File:Otto Octavius as Spider-Man (Earth-616) 001.jpg|thumb|right|Web-Swinging]]
* '''[[Superhuman Strength]]:''' Spider-Man possesses superhuman strength enabling him to press lift approximately 10 tons.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 1}}
* '''[[Superhuman Speed]]:''' Spider-Man is capable of running and moving at speeds that are far beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.{{r|Spider-Man: Back in Black Handbook Vol 1 1}} Spider-Man has showed to be fast enough to catch up to an accelerating car while on foot, but prefers to travel by webs.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #267}}
* '''[[Superhuman Stamina]]:''' Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him. At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself at his peak capacity for several hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him.{{r|Spider-Man: Back in Black Handbook Vol 1 1}}
* '''[[Superhuman Durability]]:''' Spider-Man's body is physically tougher and more resistant to some types of injury than the body of a normal human. His body is more resistant to impact forces than anything else. He can withstand great impacts, such as falling from a height of several stories or being struck by an opponent with super strength, that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no discomfort.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 1}}
* '''[[Superhuman Agility]]:''' Spider-Man's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are all enhanced to levels that are far beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete. Spider-Man is extraordinarily limber and his tendons and connective tissues are twice as elastic as the average human being's, despite their enhanced strength. He has far beyond the agility and acrobatic prowess of the most accomplished circus aerialists and acrobats. With his agility, alone, he can dodge bullets only inches away from hitting him.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 5}}
* '''Superhuman Equilibrium:''' Spider-Man possesses the ability to achieve a state of perfect equilibrium in any position imaginable. He seems able to adjust his position by instinct, which enables him to balance himself on virtually any object, no matter how small or narrow.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 1}}
* '''[[Superhuman Reflexes]]:''' Spider-Man's [[reflexes]] are similarly enhanced and are currently about 40 times greater than those of an ordinary human. In combination with his spider-sense, the speed of his reflexes allows him to dodge almost any attack, or even gunfire,{{r|Spider-Man #28}} if he is far enough away.
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Spider-Man has a limited healing factor. While not on Wolverine's level, it is sufficiently powerful enough to recover from severe injuries from broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage in a matter of days.{{r|Spider-Man: Back in Black Handbook Vol 1 1}}
* '''Contaminant Immunity:''' Due to his accelerated metabolism, Spider-Man has a higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans, and he can recover from the effects of larger doses rapidly. However, Spider-Man has the normal human tolerance for alcoholic beverages.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 38}}
* '''Spider-Sense:''' Spider-Man possesses an extrasensory "danger" or "spider" sense which warns him of potential immediate danger by the manifestation of a tingling sensation in the back of his skull, and links with his superhuman kinesthetics, enabling him to evade most any injuries, unless he cognitively overrides his automatic reflexes. The precise nature of this sense is unknown. It appears to be a simultaneous clairvoyant response to a wide variety of phenomena (everything from falling safes to speeding bullets to thrown punches), which has given several hundredths of a second warning, which is sufficient time for his reflexes to allow him to avoid injury. The sense also can create a general response on the order of several minutes: he cannot discern the nature of the threat by the sensation. He can, however, discern the severity of the danger by the strength of his response to it. Spider-Man's spider-sense is directional and can guide him to or away from hidden weapons and enemies. Sudden and extreme threats can cause his spider-sense to react with painful intensity. Spider-Man can also sense and dodge attacks directed randomly or by an artificial intelligence. Using his spider-sense to time his enhanced reflexes, Spider-Man can casually dodge attacks up to and including automatic-weapons fire, provided there is sufficient distance. His spider-sense is sufficiently well-linked to his reflexes to the point that a threat can trigger them even when Spider-Man is asleep or stunned. His spider-sense has helped him preserve his secret identity since it alerts him to observers or cameras when changing into or out of his costume. The spider-sense does react to those who Peter does not consider to be a threat, such as Aunt May. 
** '''Radio Frequency Detection:''' His spider-sense also enables him to track certain radio frequencies, which he has used to his advantage via his [[Spider-Bots]].{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 1}}

* '''[[Superhuman Strength]]:''' In his new body, Otto possessed superhuman strength enabling him to match those of Spider-Man.
* '''[[Superhuman Speed]]:''' In his new body, Otto was capable of running and moving at speeds that are far beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete.{{r|Spider-Man: Back in Black Handbook Vol 1 1}} He has showed to be fast enough to catch up to an accelerating car while on foot, but prefers to travel by webs.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #267}}
* '''[[Superhuman Stamina]]:''' In his new body, Otto's advanced musculature produced less fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allowed him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue began to impair him. At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself at his peak capacity for several hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him.
* '''[[Superhuman Durability]]:''' In his new body, Otto's body was physically tougher and more resistant to some types of injury than the body of a normal human. His body was more resistant to impact forces than anything else. He could withstand great impacts, such as falling from a height of several stories or being struck by an opponent with super strength, that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no discomfort.
* '''[[Superhuman Agility]]:''' Spider-Man's agility, balance, and bodily coordination are all enhanced to levels that are far beyond the natural physical limits of the finest human athlete. Spider-Man is extraordinarily limber and his tendons and connective tissues are twice as elastic as the average human being's, despite their enhanced strength. He has far beyond the agility and acrobatic prowess of the most accomplished circus aerialists and acrobats, all combined. He can also perform any complicated sequence of gymnastic stunts such as flips, rolls, and springs. He can easily outmatch any Olympic record at gymnastics apparatus such as flying rings, climbing ropes, horizontal bars, trampolines. With his agility, alone, he can dodge bullets only inches away from hitting him.
* '''Superhuman Equilibrium:''' Spider-Man possesses the ability to achieve a state of perfect equilibrium in any position imaginable. He seems able to adjust his position by instinct, which enables him to balance himself on virtually any object, no matter how small or narrow.
* '''[[Superhuman Reflexes]]:''' In his new body, Otto's [[reflexes]] were similarly enhanced and are currently about 40 times greater than those of an ordinary human. In combination with his spider-sense, the speed of his reflexes allowed him to dodge almost any attack, or even gunfire,{{r|Spider-Man #28}} if he was far enough away. Spider-Man has even been shown in some cases, to be able to dodge bullets only inches away from his face.
* '''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' In his new body, Otto had a limited healing factor. While not on Wolverine's level, it was sufficiently powerful enough to recover from severe injuries from broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage in a matter of days.
* '''Contaminant Immunity:''' Due to his accelerated metabolism, Otto had a higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans, and he could recover from the effects of larger doses rapidly. During an encounter with the Swarm, Spider-Man was incapacitated by thousands of bee stings, but recovered in less than 24 hours. His resistance and recovery time to other toxins and diseases varies, but is typically significantly higher than normal. However, Spider-Man has the normal human tolerance for alcoholic beverages.
* '''Spider-Sense:''' In his new body, Otto possessed an extrasensory "danger" or "spider" sense which warned him of potential immediate danger by the manifestation of a tingling sensation in the back of his skull, and linked with his superhuman kinesthetics, enabled him to evade most any injuries, unless he cognitively overrode his automatic reflexes. The precise nature of this sense is unknown. It appears to be a simultaneous clairvoyant response to a wide variety of phenomena (everything from falling safes to speeding bullets to thrown punches), which has given several hundredths of a second warning, which is sufficient time for his reflexes to allow him to avoid injury. The sense also can create a general response on the order of several minutes: he cannot discern the nature of the threat by the sensation. He can, however, discern the severity of the danger by the strength of his response to it. Spider-Man's spider-sense is directional and can guide him to or away from hidden weapons and enemies. Sudden and extreme threats can cause his spider-sense to react with painful intensity. Spider-Man can also sense and dodge attacks directed randomly or by an artificial intelligence. Using his spider-sense to time his enhanced reflexes, Spider-Man can casually dodge attacks up to and including automatic-weapons fire, provided there is sufficient distance. His spider-sense is sufficiently well-linked to his reflexes to the point that a threat can trigger them even when Spider-Man is asleep or stunned. His spider-sense has helped him preserve his secret identity since it alerts him to observers or cameras when changing into or out of his costume. The spider-sense does react to those who Peter does not consider to be a threat, such as Aunt May. Spider-Man can choose to ignore his spider-sense, and distraction or fatigue diminish its effectiveness. Spider-Man's fighting style incorporates the advantage that his "spider-sense" provides him. His body begins to produce more adrenaline after the sense is triggered, an extension of the 'fight or flight syndrome.' Even when he does not have the use of his eyes Spider-Man can still use his Spider Sense in a similar fashion to [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]]'s Radar Sense to help him see by sensing the direction the danger is coming from by listening on the loudest noise around him.
** '''Radio Frequency Detection:''' His spider-sense also enables him to track certain radio frequencies, which he has used to his advantage via his [[Spider-Tracer|Spider-Tracers]].

| Abilities               = '''[[Genius Intelligence]]:''' Otto Octavius is a multi-discipline scientist with expertise in various fields of science.{{r|Avengers NOW! Vol 1 1}}
* '''Radiation Specialist:''' Doctor Octopus is one of the world's leading authorities on nuclear radiation and its effect on animal physiology.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #3}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 267}}
* '''Engineering:''' Doctor Octopus is a brilliant engineer and inventor, due to his own ability and more recently due to having Peter's memories.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #3}}
| Strength               = Without the use of his artificial tentacles, Otto possessed the normal human strength of a man of his age, height, and build who engages in no regular exercise. Each of his tentacles is able to lift approximately 8 tons (provided that Octopus supports his harness with at least one other arm in order to prevent the chest harness/skin interface from bearing any part of the effort). With one arm, Octopus could lift an automobile. With two arms, he could throw an automobile tens of feet, or lift a small bus. The pincers on his arms are capable of gripping with a force of 175 pounds per square inch, sufficient to deform any object made of a thin-walled substance less durable than steel. The pincers can, for instance, crush a handgun. By combining the intrinsic strength of both his tentacles and the pincers, Doctor Octopus could perform such feats as tearing steel doors off bank vaults.
| Weaknesses               = '''Arrogance:''' On many occasions, Otto's pride has been a major factor in many of his defeats. Otto considers himself to be the smartest person on the planet and that he could never be wrong due to his massive intellect. This confidence in his own intelligence frequently causes him to ignore factors that could derail his plans leaving him unprepared for when these factors come into play. This also makes him at wits with other heroes, mostly the Avengers.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 8}}

{{Navigation
| title = Former Weaknesses
| body  = '''Sonic and Heat:''' While bonded to the Venom symbiote, Otto gained its powers, but also its extreme vulnerability to heat and sonic based attacks.{{Citation}} They can cause the symbiote physical pain and discomfort, where as "more powerful" attacks might be completely ineffective.{{Citation}}
* '''Brain damage:''' the accident which gave Octavius control of his arms also caused irreversible brain damage — transforming the respected scientist into a megalomaniacal superhuman criminal.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #3}}{{r|Spider-Man - Doctor Octopus: Year One #4}} As part of the deal which restored Octopus, Mephisto offered to fix it, which suggests the demon is convinced the brain damage was a false excuse and Otto will return to villainy anyway.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 11}}
* '''Pill Dependence:''' In order to prevent his cloned body from breaking down due the cellular breakdown caused by a flaw in the Jackal's cloning process, Otto has to ingest daily [[New U Pills|a pill]] provided by him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 20}} Currently, this weaknesses no longer apllies after he managed to implanted his mind and consciousness into the Proto-Clone that was immune to degeneration.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 25}}
{{Clear}}
Since he had all the powers that Spider-Man had, Otto presumably still had the same weaknesses. These included:
* '''Spider-Sense Disruption:''' Spider-Man's Spider Sense can lose its effectiveness if it is blocked or temporarily weakened by specialized equipment or certain drugs. It also would not trigger if it detects something that is not registered as a threat like the Spider-Man clones. When deprived of his spider-sense, Spider-Man becomes vulnerable to surveillance and attack, and web-slinging requires most of his concentration.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 655}}
* '''Ethyl Chloride:''' Perhaps as a side effect of gaining his powers, Spider-Man is susceptible to the pesticide ethyl chloride. This chemical is frequently used as a weapon by the [[Spider-Slayer|Spider-Slayers]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 291}}

'''[[Web-Shooters]]:''' Parker's brilliance at physical science allowed him to create web-shooters for use when he became Spider-Man.<ref>''[http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/05/smart_heroes/index_01.htm Smartest Superheroes]''</ref> The twin devices worn on his wrists are able to shoot thin strands of a special "web fluid" at high pressure. The web fluid was modified in Octavius' possession, allowing it to be stronger and last longer, something Peter found out the hard way when he was forced to make web underwear and ended up having his pants glued to it.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 2}}
* '''Web Fluid:''' A shear-thinning liquid, virtually solid until a shearing force is applied to it, rendering it fluid, whose exact formula remains unknown, but is rumored to be related to nylon. The web line’s tensile strength is estimated to be 120 pounds per square millimeter of cross section.{{Citation}}

'''Talons:''' Octavius had added retractable sharp talons on his hands and feet, which he uses in combat against his enemies. The talons can also be used to inject nano-spider-tracers with GPS and listening device.{{Citation}}

'''[[Spider-Man's Utility Belt|Utility Belt]]:''' Spider-Man keeps a utility belt holding web cartridges and his signature Spider-Signal.{{Citation}}

'''[[Superior Spider-Man's Suit]]:''' An updated version of the original Spider-Man costume that features sharp talons on the hands and feet, as well as enhanced lenses in the mask with HUD and tracking abilities. The talon gloves feature retractable talons on his finger-tips and toe tips which can be used for clawing and climbing. After making new ones, Otto can activate the talons faster.{{Citation}}

'''[[Spider-Bots]]:''' Spider based versions of Octavius' Octobots used for gathering information across New York City. When Otto was possessed by the Venom symbiote, people were outraged with Otto's fight with the Avengers and began smashing his spider-bots to pieces.

[[File:Anthony Stark (Earth-616) and Otto Octavius (Earth-616) from Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 22 001.jpg|thumb|right|Even Iron Man falls to the power of Doctor Octopus!]]
'''[[Doctor Octopus' Tentacles]]:''' Doctor Octopus has possessed a total of three different harnesses during his career: the original titanium harness, a more powerful Adamantium harness, and the current harness, which was modified in 2004 to resemble the version seen in the movie ''[[Spider-Man 2 (film)|Spider-Man 2]]''. The original and Adamantium harnesses were both destroyed in the Lethal Foes of Spider-Man miniseries. The current harness has eight tentacles as opposed to four.
* '''Original Harness:''' With his titanium harness, Doc Ock was able to beat [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], a seasoned combatant with superhuman senses, almost to death out of sheer power.{{r|Daredevil #165}} It was also temporarily worn by Spider-Man after Octavius' death, until the Hobgoblin caused it to short-circuit via pumpkin bomb. Spider-Man than proceeded to rip them apart when he lost control.
{{Navigation

* '''Adamantium Harness:''' Using [[Adamantium]], Octavius created an entirely new indestructible harness, with all of the abilities he had before but with exponentially higher durability. Using this harness, he was able to best [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] in combat, tearing the hero's armor apart with a defeat so harsh that Tony Stark began to doubt his abilities almost enough to resort back to alcoholism.{{r|Marvel Fanfare #22}} He knocked [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|the Hulk]] unconscious{{r|Spider-Man #19}} and, by Spider-Man's own reckoning, was "holding his own" against the combined forces of himself, the Hulk, the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], [[Michael Collins (Earth-616)|Deathlok]], [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]], and [[James Bourne (Earth-616)|Solo]], even after the rest of the Sinister Six were defeated or fled.{{r|Spider-Man #23}}

| Notes                   = * Doctor Octopus was the first Spider-Man villain ever to be given a real name in their debut appearance.
* Doctor Octopus was #96 in the Series A Marvel Value Stamps, released in the 1970s.
[[File:Otto Octavius (Earth-616) from Marvel Value Stamps 0001.jpg|thumb|right|Marvel Value Stamp #96]]
* Otto's phone number as the Superior Spider-Man was 800-555-7739 and he advertised it as 1-800-555-SPDY.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #15}} 
* At one point, a boy named [[Oliver Osnick (Earth-616)|Oliver Osnick]] ran away from home, having stolen his father's Octopus-like equipment. He intended to become Doctor Octopus' sidekick, which was to be very much ill-fated. After a brief skirmish with Spider-Man, Osnick was returned home, without his tentacles. 
* Otto dislikes [[Homo superior|mutants]] and [[clones]], calling them respectively "genetic freaks"{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #16}} and "abominations".{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 20}}
* After hearing a recording of himself in his prime, Otto stated that he sounded like an underwater walrus (it is notable to state that he was in Spider-Man's body at the time of him listening to the recording).{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #15.1}}
* Otto hates dealing with children.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #17}}
* He doesn't believe people can change.{{r|Superior Spider-Man #5}}{{r|Superior Spider-Man #11}}
* When Spider-Man revealed that the "Superior Spider-Man" was really Doctor Octopus on live television, no one believed him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 5}}
| Trivia                  = * The DC Comics super-villain [[w:c:dc:Gorgon (New Earth)|Gorgon]] is based on Doctor Octopus; a morbidly obese man with prosthetic hands and a number of coil-like tentacles growing out of his head, Gorgon is a member of the [[w:c:dc:Extremists (New Earth)|Extremists]], a team of villains from a parallel world all based on popular Marvel Comics villains. 
* Another Doctor Octopus homage outside of Marvel Comics is [http://savagedragonwiki.wikispaces.com/Octopus The Octopus], a criminal “super-freak” in Erik Larsen’s ''Savage Dragon''.  His real name Dr. Wipple, the Octopus is a criminal scientist with the beak of an octopus and four massive tentacles growing out of his torso. More mild-mannered than his inspiration, he is often seen in the series doing scientific work alongside fellow criminal scientist, Openface. 
* Otto used Facebook, Skype, and Twitter.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 27.NOW}}
* In his first appearance, his surname was spelt Octavious.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 3}}
* Otto's favorite of Peter Parker's suits was his [[Spider-Man's Suit#Black Cloth Suit|black cloth suit]], as he found it slimming.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 48}}
* Octavius is an atheist.{{r|Avengers Vol 7 10}}
* Otto's former alias, "Elliot Tolliver", has a meaning that reflects his egomaniac personality and abilities:
** "Elliot" is the Greek form of the Hebrew name "Elijah", which means "Jehovah is God". This refers to how Otto considers himself superior, sometimes exhibiting a "God Complex".
** "Tolliver" is the English form of the Italian family name "Taliaferro", which itself derives from "tagliare" ("to cut") and "ferro" ("iron"). This name was often used as a nickname for a metal worker or a fighter. This refers to both Otto's intellect for engineering as well his fighting skills thanks to [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]]'s genes.
* Despite the time he was a partial clone of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and possessing all of his powers, Otto was not a Spider-Totem.{{r|Spider-Geddon Vol 1 1}}
* Otto doesn't like kielbasa.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 4}}
