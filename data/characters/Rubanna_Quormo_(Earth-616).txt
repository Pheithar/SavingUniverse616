Caregiver is one of the [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elders of the Universe]], sole survivors of long-dead races whose dedication to a certain goal has granted them immortality. She has used her lifetime of perhaps thousands to millions of years to develop her nurturing abilities.{{Citation}}    

When fellow Elder the  [[Tath Ki (Earth-616)|Contemplator (Thath Ki)]] realized the embryonic cosmic being [[Origin (Earth-616)|Origin]] was at mortal risk from injuries suffered by the imense  [[K'rll (Earth-616)|Soul-Eater]], he summoned Caregiver (upon  [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)]] request for aid) who both sealed the ruptured embryonic sac and soothed [[Origin (Earth-616)|Origin]]. When [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]] was seemingly destroyed by the  [[Ultimate Nullifier (Weapon)|Ultimate Nullifier]] soon after, his [[Quantum Bands]] were transported to the newborn [[Origin (Earth-616)|Origin]]. This led other Elders, including the  [[Zamanathan Rambunazeth (Earth-616)|Explorer (ZamanathanRambunazeth)]],  [[Maht Pacle (Earth-616)|Obliterator (Maht Pacle)]] and  [[Kamo Tharnn (Earth-616)|Possessor (Kamo Tharnn)]], as well as a [[Skrulls|Skrull]] posing as [[Tath Ki (Earth-616)|Contemplator (Thath Ki)]], to try and claim the cosmic infant, the [[Quantum Bands]] or both. Bypassing another Elder, the   [[Judicator (Earth-616)|Judicator]], Caregiver pushed [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]] into [[Origin (Earth-616)|Origin]] embryonic sac, both saving him from outer space as his energy reserves faded and granting him access to the bands.{{Citation}}    

The [[Judicator (Earth-616)|Judicator]] remanded [[Origin (Earth-616)|Origin]] to Caregiver. Shortly thereafter, [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]] petitioned Caregiver to save his mother, [[Lisa Vaughn (Earth-616)|Lisa Vaughn]], from breast cancer, but Caregiver refused, stating [[Lisa Vaughn (Earth-616)|Lisa]] had no cosmological significance and was thus outside her sphere of influence.{{Citation}}       

| Powers                  = While Caregiver's power are undefined she demonstrates both empathic and soothing abilities. Since she is immortal she is immune to aging and terrestrial diseases.
