Before the [[Skrulls]]' [[Secret Invasion]] started, [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] tasked [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Daisy Johnson]] with recruiting select individuals that he had files on for what would become his secret strike force team. Sebastian Druid was approached by Daisy, after he sought out [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] to help him learn about his powers. She revealed that his powers aren't technically magical. While he's the son of [[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Doctor Druid]], he also has monster DNA, making his powers chemical in nature.{{r|Mighty Avengers #13}}

===Secret Invasion===
As a member of the "[[Secret Warriors (Earth-616)|Secret Warriors]]" he was given the code name Druid and was trained alongside [[Jerry Sledge (Earth-616)|Stonewall]], [[Alexander Aaron (Earth-616)|Phobos]], [[Yo Yo Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Yo Yo Rodriguez]], and [[James Taylor James (Earth-616)|Hellfire]].{{r|Mighty Avengers #13}} One of their first missions was to take out the [[Dard'van Sect (Earth-616)|Dard'van]], the religious sect of Skrulls leading the invasion.{{r|Secret Invasion #3|4}} After the battle, Druid and the team struggled to deal with the [[Dark Reign|fallout]] of the invasion.{{r|Dark Reign: New Nation #1}}

===Hydra===
The Secret Warriors were observing activity at an [[Black Ice|old S.H.I.E.L.D. base]] in [[Texas (State)|Texas]] when they discovered [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] operatives attempting to steal something. In defiance of their orders to observe only, Slingshot, Druid, and Stonewall engaged the terrorists. During a meal with the team, Phobos told them he could see the future and prophesies about each member, he told he Druid that he would become a great hero. Following Slingshot's severe injuries at the hands of the [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]], Daisy and Druid traveled to [[Australia]] to recruit [[Eden Fesi (Earth-616)|Eden Fesi]] as a replacement.{{r|Secret Warriors #1|4}} After too many failures with the team, Druid was given a note saying that he was a liability and to go home.{{r|Secret Warriors #13}}

===Return===
It was a ruse, however, and when Sebastian arrived home, he found [[Jonathan Garrett (Earth-616)|John Garrett]] waiting for him. He spent two months getting Druid into shape, then took him on training missions to help Fury, such as destroying the remains of two crashed [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier|Helicarriers]] before the Chinese could examine the technology and creating a magic bullet that can shoot through walls so that Garrett could assassinate Leviathan agent [[Vasili Dassaiev (Earth-616)|Magadan]] and pin it on Hydra.{{r|Secret Warriors #23}}

When Fury's assault on the Hydra base [[Gehenna (Hydra Base)|Gehenna]] went sideways, Sebastian was in the plane that picked the team up. With Hydra jets in pursuit, Sebastian overrode Fury's plan and used his powers to destroy all the following jets by himself, which impressed Fury.{{r|Secret Warriors #26|27}}

Once back at Fury's base [[Excalibur (Location)|Excalibur]], Garrett told Sebastian how proud he was of him, but after the last mission left [[James Taylor James (Earth-616)|Hellfire]] and [[Alexander Aaron (Earth-616)|Phobos]] dead, [[Eden Fesi (Earth-616)|Eden Fesi]] in a coma, and [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Daisy]] heartbroken, the Caterpillar team was disbanded.{{r|Secret Warriors #28}}

| Powers                  = '''Chemical Mysticism''': While Sebastian initially thought he possessed a talent for magic, it was revealed his powers actually originate from monster DNA, making his powers chemical in nature.{{r|Mighty Avengers #13}}

He can generate various almost potent effects such as;
* '''''Levitation'''''{{r|Secret Invasion #4}}
* '''''Energy Projection'''''{{r|Secret Invasion #4}}
* '''''Force Fields'''''{{r|Secret Invasion #4}}
* '''''Teleportation'''''{{r|Secret Invasion #4}}
* He created a magic bullet that could pass through walls and create a very specific pattern of blood spatter.{{r|Secret Warriors #23}}
* He accelerated the natural rate of corrosion in the metal of a destroyed Helicarrier, seemingly making it disappear in an instant.{{r|Secret Warriors #23}}

He was considered as a [[:Category:Sorcerer Supreme Candidates|possible Sorcerer Supreme]].{{r|War of the Realms: Journey into Mystery Vol 1 1}}[[Category:Sorcerer Supreme Candidates]]
