| HistoryText             = Deathwings are large winged creatures that dwell in the heart of the [[Black Sun (Dark Nebula)|Black Sun]] located in the midst of the [[Dark Nebula]]. They appear as solid black Pterodon-looking creatures. Their chill breath will strip flesh from the bones of beings. They can be summoned by the [[Dire Wraiths]] though not controlled by them.  A number of them were able to thwart [[Galactus]] attempt to devour the Wraith's star system ([[Wraithworld]] and the Black Sun).
