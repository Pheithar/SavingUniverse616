| History                 = Powerlord Kruun was the overall tyrant of [[Breakworld]], who ordered to intercept and destroy the [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] spaceship where [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] was located.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 19}}

When the soldiers landed, he ordered to capture and interrogate them, while he would talk to [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]].{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 20}}

She said she could kill the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and that they had that common goal, so he finally agreed because the weapon aimed at [[Earth]] needed to be protected.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 21}}

When he learned that Danger betrayed them and Colossus was seen with [[Aghanne (Earth-616)|Aghanne]], he spied the X-Men, who were heading in a spaceship towards the moon-based weapon.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 22}}

Thinking they had a secret plan called 'Leviathan', he ordered to blast the shuttle upon which [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] escaped; after the mutant died, he brought him back to life to interrogate him about Leviathan.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 23}}

He was then defeated by Cyclops' optic rays and held prisoner in his own fortress, until he was freed by [[Ord (SWORD) (Earth-616)|Ord]].{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 24}}

He was eventually maimed by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and dethroned by Colossus,{{r|Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men Vol 1 1}}
