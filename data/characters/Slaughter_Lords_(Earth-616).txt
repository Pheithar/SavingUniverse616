The '''Slaughter Squad''' was a group of brigands and thieves gathered by [[J'son (Earth-616)|Mister Knife]] to serve as his personal crew. They invaded [[Kymellia III]] to steal the [[Black Vortex]], an ancient artifact capable of unleashing the cosmic potential of whoever wields it, for Mister Knife. [[Nux Vomico (Earth-616)|Nux Vomico]] ended up succumbing to the Black Vortex's powers and was consequently killed by Mister Knife.{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 5}}

Later, the Slaughter Squad kidnapped Mister Knife's son, [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]],{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 6}} but he was ultimately rescued by his girlfriend, [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Kitty Pryde]].{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 7}}

With his plans moving forward after convincing [[Thane (Earth-616)|Thane]] to join his cause,{{r|Legendary Star-Lord Vol 1 8}} Mister Knife allowed the Slaughter Squad to submit to the Black Vortex, unleashing their cosmic potential and turning them into the '''Slaughter Lords'''.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy & X-Men: Black Vortex Alpha Vol 1 1}}
