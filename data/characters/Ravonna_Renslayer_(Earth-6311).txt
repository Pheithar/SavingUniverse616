| History                 = [[File:Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-6311) and Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311) from Avengers Vol 1 24 001.jpg|thumb|left]] Ravonna Renslayer was the daughter of [[Carelius (Earth-6311)|King Carelius]], a ruler in the [[Earth-6311|40th century]] [[Earth]]. The kingdom of Carelius was the last bastion of civilization unconquered by [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]] in that time period. Kang spared them because he was smitten with Ravonna and her fire. She refused his love because he was a commoner and not royalty, but he swore to win her heart eventually. Kang summoned the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] to his future in the hopes of winning Ravonna's affection by displaying his battle prowess. Instead, the Avengers joined forces with Ravonna when Kang grew tired of the games and ordered a full invasion of her kingdom.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 23}} After Kang conquered the Avengers and the kingdom, he demanded a wedding ceremony be prepared. Kang's code had always been to kill the rulers of any conquered nation, however, to prevent uprisings. His general [[Baltag (Earth-6311)|Baltag]] betrayed Kang in order to honor that code, and tried to have his ruler assassinated. Kang ended up allied with Ravonna and the Avengers to stop his rebellious army. Baltag was defeated, but tried to kill Kang with one last shot. Ravonna threw herself in the path of the blast, saving Kang's life. She professed her newfound love for him with her last breath.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 24}}

After Kang was diverged into two different counterparts (after the battle with [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]), the "Prime" Kang went to the [[Limbo (Temporal)|Limbo]], searching a way to revive Ravonna; with Limbo's technology, Kang plucked Ravonna away from the timeline before she was killed by Baltag; instead of saving the "true" Ravonna, Prime Kang created a [[Earth-8657|divergent reality]] where [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-8657)|Kang]] was killed instead of her.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 269}}

After Prime Kang saved her, [[Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-8657)|this version of Ravonna]] appeared in Limbo and stayed with him as his princess.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 267|269}}

The other divergent version of Kang created after the battle with Thor preserved Ravonna's body in stasis, one breath from her demise. When the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] challenged him to a game, he promised Kang the power over life or death, thereby giving him a chance to revive Ravonna. However, the angry Kang chose the power of Death in order to kill the Avengers. This scheme failed, however, as Kang didn't take into account the presence of the [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]], who was not at that time an Avenger.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 71}} Ravonna was later revived by the Grandmaster, who showed her the choices Kang had made. Ravonna grew bitter about Kang's failure to save her, and swore to avenge herself on him.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 21}} A duplicate was left behind in Ravonna's stasis pod, leaving Kang unaware of her revival.

[[File:Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-6311) from Avengers Vol 1 291.jpg|thumb|right|Posing as [[Kang]]-[[Nebula]]]]
Ravonna's first plot saw her appearing to the then-Avenger [[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Doctor Druid]] in visions in order to gain his help in securing a highly powerful weapon that was believed to exist within the [[Bubble at the Heart of Time]]. Ravonna had learned of this weapon after disguising herself as the space pirate [[Nebula (Earth-616)|Nebula]] in order to infiltrate the [[Council of Cross-Time Kangs (Multiverse)|Council of Cross-Time Kangs]]. After stepping up her scheme to control Doctor Druid, she influenced him to take over leadership of the Avengers, manipulating his teammates with his psychic abilities to vote him in as chairman. With Druid and the rest of the Avengers under her power, Ravonna made them accompany her into a timestorm to retrieve the weapon. She was opposed, however by three members of the Council of Cross-Time Kangs, as well as the Avengers, who managed to shake off Druid's control. One of the Avengers, [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]], battled Ravonna herself. Ravonna was apparently lost in the timestorm along with Druid.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 291|297}}

Ravonna later attempted to influence the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] into freeing her from the timestorm and helping her gain the [[Ultimate Nullifier]], but her plans were thwarted by the team.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 337|339}} She later escaped the timestorm, onto [[Earth-616]] in the year 1961. This time she was defeated by a younger version of Druid, before she could take control of him again.{{r|Avengers Spotlight Vol 1 37}}

She later took on another guise, that of the [[Terminatrix]], to battle Kang himself. Kang sacrificed himself so that she could live.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 21}} 

Now calling herself the Terminatrix, Ravonna put Kang in stasis and in order to keep his empire in order and safe from the [[Council of Cross-Time Kangs (Multiverse)|Council of Cross-Time Kangs]], she began posing as Kang, the only beings aware of her deception being the [[Anachronauts (Multiverse)|Anachronauts]]. She also began investigating eras earlier in time and discovered the temporal creature known as [[Alioth (Temporal Limbo)|Alioth]] who ruled those eras and threatened to consume Kang's empire as well. Later, Ravonna's future self [[Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-93091)|Revelation]] summoned three [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]: [[Eric Masterson (Earth-616)|Thunderstrike]], [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]], and [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|US Agent]], to stop the Terminatrix from reviving Kang. In retaliation, the Terminatrix summoned Avengers of her own: [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]].{{r|Avengers: The Terminatrix Objective #1}} While the two teams of Avengers were manipulated into fighting each other, the Terminatrix was lured to the year [[Earth-93091|9999 AD]] by Revelation. When [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]] was finally about to die, his wife [[Ravonna Renslayer (Earth-8657)|Ravonna Renslayer]] wished to die alogside him. However, neither could bear to ask their son [[Marcus Immortus (Earth-93091)|Marcus Immortus]] to kill his mother, and so Immortus summoned six alternate versions of his wife from much earlier in her life, including Terminatrix. Placing them in stasis, Immortus explained that by killing their future self they would go on a path to become her and live a life fo fullfillment. Terminatrix volunteered and euthanized her elder self right after Immortus died. She then immediately escaped, leaving the fate of other Ravonnas uknown.{{r|Avengers: The Terminatrix Objective Vol 1 3}} 

In the year 9999 Revelation convinced Terminatrix that she actually sought to assist her in defeating Alioth and provided her with advanced medicine from her point in time to cure Kang of his injuries. However before the Terminatrix could return to Chronopolis, Alioth attacked.{{r|Avengers: The Terminatrix Objective #3}} As the Avengers battled Alioth, the Terminatrix returned and used the device given to her by Revelation and it successfully restored Kang to full health. Kang, Terminatrix and Revelation then recovered the Avengers as Alioth absorbed the Council of Cross-Time Kangs, killing them all. Equipping the Avengers with devices to protect them from the chronal-beast, Kang also gave them a weapon to destroy it: the Chrono-Key. When they attacked Alioth in the council chambers, the Chrono-Key transformed into [[Tempus (Temporal Limbo)|Tempus]] a chronal being that absorbed the latent chronal energy with the dead bodies of the Cross-Time Kangs and Tempus was able to pull Alioth creating a time barrier preventing Alioth from becoming a threat to Chronopolis. Angry at the loss of lives, the Avengers tried to confront Kang but he quickly banished them from his realm. Then when it appeared that he and Ravonna would finally reconcile their differences, she stabbed him in the back intending to revive him so that they would be considered equals in an attempt to deviate herself from the possible future where she would become Revelation. She then assumed the name "Rebecca Tourminet" and traveled to [[Timely (Wisconsin)|Timely]] in 1903, reconciling with Kang during his time as "Victor Timely".{{r|Avengers: The Terminatrix Objective #4}}

Ravonna was reported as having been killed in the destruction of Chronopolis by [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]] and his forces, though whether she will resurface once again despite this is unknown.{{r|Avengers: Forever Vol 1 3}}{{r|Avengers: Forever Vol 1 9}}
