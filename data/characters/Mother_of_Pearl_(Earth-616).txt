| History                 = Mother of Pearl was part of a splinter [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] branch called the Pearl Sect that lived underneath the [[Crash Pad]], the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]] headquarters. The base was built but never completed by the [[Taylor Foundation (Earth-616)|Taylor Foundation]] back when it was corrupt. Originally, the headquarters was going to be used by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], but they never moved in. Eventually, Hydra began squatting there until the New Warriors arrived at which time Hydra hid in the subterranean levels for years. Eventually, [[Carlton LaFroyge (Earth-616)|Hindsight]] figured a way to unlock a huge metal door the New Warriors had never opened in the crash pad and discovered the Hydra agents residing there. Mother of Pearl kidnapped Hindsight and hoped to rebuild Hydra. He and the rogue Hydra agents were defeated by the New Warriors.{{r|New Warriors #72}}
