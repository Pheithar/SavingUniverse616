===Baron Strucker's High Council===
Following [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]'s seeming discovery of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s long-term manipulation of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]],{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 1}} [[Supreme Hydra]] [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] gathered [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]], [[Kraken]] (actually [[Jacob Fury (Earth-616)|Jake Fury]] posing as [[Daniel Whitehall (Earth-616)|Daniel Whitehall]]), a new [[Madame Hydra]] (unknown to all, [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Earth-616)|Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]], a longtime agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was actually a sleeper agent of [[Leviathan (Earth-616)|Leviathan]]), [[Hive (Earth-616)|Hive]], and a resurrected [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] to form the first iteration of the High Council of Hydra.{{r|The High Council of Hydra's first gathering and [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]]'s resurrection happen in {{cl|Secret Warriors Vol 1 2}}, while the revelation of [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Earth-616)|Madame Hydra]] and [[Jacob Fury (Earth-616)|Kraken]]'s true identities happen in {{cl|Secret Warriors Vol 1 14}} and {{cl|Secret Warriors Vol 1 26}}, respectively.}}

After coming into conflict with Fury's [[Secret Warriors (Earth-616)|Secret Warriors]],{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 3}} the Council decided it was time to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. once and for all.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 4}} Upon learning Fury planned to attack the [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] [[The Dock|shipyards]] to regain his [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier|Helicarrier]] fleet, the male members of the Council split away to lead an assault against Fury while the female ones obtained a box{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 5|6}} containing a [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] power source{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 25|26}} from [[Clan Yashida (Earth-616)|Clan Yashida]].{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 6}} With the High Council focused on warring with Fury, Leviathan agents kidnapped Viper,{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 12}} who was killed by Madame Hydra{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 14}} and later brought back to life by the Hive.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 15}}

Hydra and Leviathan went to war with one another, their conflict ending with Leviathan's destruction and the High Council of Hydra's disbandment: Viper and Gorgon decided to leave Strucker to cut their losses and took their Hydra troops with them,{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 22}} the Hive was seemingly killed by the [[Caterpillars (Earth-616)|Caterpillars]]' Grey Team,{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 24}} and Kraken's identity as Jake Fury was revealed. Jake was in fact a double agent working for his brother Nick, helping him finally kill Baron Strucker.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 1 25|27}} Afterwards, Gorgon and Viper went on to join [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] and his H.A.M.M.E.R. coalition.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 16.1}} Norman Osborn was ultimately defeated by the combined efforts of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], and H.A.M.M.E.R. was disbanded. Viper used the remaining agents to reconstruct Hydra as the new head of the organization.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 24}}

===Baron Zemo's High Sect===
When Hydra discovered a young [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] boy (named [[Lucas (Inhuman) (Earth-616)|Lucas]]) whose blood contained a toxin capable of sterilizing human beings, new Hydra leader [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]] created a plan to use his blood as a bioweapon to sterilize the world, leaving only immunized Hydra operatives with the ability to reproduce. [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc the Leaper]], [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]], [[Piet Voorhees (Earth-616)|Cobra]], [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Sin]], [[Antonio Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Armadillo]], Viper, [[John Falsworth (Earth-616)|Baron Blood]], and [[Brock Rumlow (Earth-616)|Crossbones]] joined Zemo's cause of their own free will, thus becoming his High Sect.{{r|All-New Captain America Vol 1 2}}

When their original plan to spread Lucas' blood failed due to the combined efforts of [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America (Sam Wilson)]], [[Ian Rogers (Earth-616)|Nomad]], and [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]],{{r|All-New Captain America Vol 1 3|5}} Baron Blood attempted to detonate himself in the high atmosphere while full of the boy's blood, but this contingency plan was too thwarted by Captain America. With most of its members defeated, the High Sect disbanded.{{r|{{c|All-New Captain America Vol 1 5}}-[[All-New Captain America Vol 1 6|6]]}}

===Captain America's High Council===
[[File:High Council of Hydra (Earth-616) from Captain America Steve Rogers Vol 1 14 001.jpg|thumb|right]]
Hailing from [[Earth-61311|a world governed by Hydra]] created by the sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] named [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]], the powerful witch [[Elisa Sinclair (Earth-61311)|Elisa Sinclair]] took the mantle of Madame Hydra and created a new High Council. This new iteration consisted of Hive, Viper, [[Johann Fennhoff (Earth-616)|Dr. Faustus]], Gorgon, [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]], [[Kraken (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|a new Kraken]], Baron Zemo, and the [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America (Steve Rogers)]] of the same world Sinclair originated from.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 14}}

After months of planning, Captain America led Hydra into taking over the [[United States of America]] while also eliminating any opposition from the superhero community.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} The High Council ran the country from that point forward, but a few of its members questioned Captain America's methods and even tried to subvert his rule.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}}{{r|Secret Empire: Uprising Vol 1 1}} After the death of Madame Hydra,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 6}} Captain America started getting serious and ordered the High Council to retrieve the last few remnants of Kobik so he could restore his world. The High Council split up and launched simultaneous attacks on [[New Tian]] and [[Wakanda]], managing to obtain the Cosmic Cube fragments kept there.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 7}}{{r|Captain America Vol 8 25}} Things started to fall apart for Hydra when America's superhero community reunited and banded together to overthrow their rule. Much of the High Council took part in the final battle in [[Washington, D.C.]], but they were defeated and Hydra's rule over the United States was ended.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 8|10}}
