In response to a threat to the [[Counter-Earth (High Evolutionary)|Counter-Earth]] from [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]], Gorr was evolved from a gorilla by the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary (Herbert Wyndham)]] and sent to Earth{{r|Fantastic Four #172}}. When Gorr arrived on Earth, he grew to an enormous size, panicked and began a rampage across Manhattan until he was subdued by the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]{{r|Fantastic Four #171}}. After returning to normal size, Gorr told the Fantastic Four that Earth's atmosphere caused him to grow, which made him panic and lose control{{r|Fantastic Four #172}}. Gorr teamed up with the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch (Jonathan Storm)]] to find a suitable planet for Galactus to consume in place of Counter-Earth{{r|Fantastic Four #173}}. After the ordeal, Johnny asked Gorr what his plans for the future were, to which Gorr replied that he would remain a valet to the High Evolutionary{{r|Fantastic Four #175}}.

He was captured by the enigmatic alien, the [[Stranger (Cosmic Being) (Earth-616)|Stranger]], and were imprisoned in the Stranger's [[Labworld]] for the alien to study him. He remained their until freed by [[Grom (Earth-616)|Overmind]].{{r|{{r|Quasar Vol 1 #16}}}}
