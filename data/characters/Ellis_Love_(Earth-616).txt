===Origin===
Ellis Love was a telepathic criminal who was serving time on the [[Raft]].{{r|Secret Warriors #16}}

===Caterpillar===
As she was listed as an untapped superhuman which he could use in his secret war against [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] and [[Leviathan (Earth-616)|Leviathan]], [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] freed her and gave her a reduced sentence if she joined his {{m|Caterpillars}} teams. She was assigned to Team Black, which was led by [[Alexander Pierce (Earth-616)|Alexander Pierce]], and where all of the more problematic Caterpillars were sent.{{r|Secret Warriors #16}}

Team Black was deployed to take part in a joint attack on [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s [[Hell's Heaven]] base in [[China]] along with the [[Howling Commandos Private Military Company (Earth-616)|Howling Commandos PMC]].{{r|Secret Warriors #17}} The mission was successful with Team Black taking point on the infiltration of the base, allowing for a bomb to be detonated destroying the base.{{r|Secret Warriors #18}} With their mission complete, Team Black made their own separate exit, not realizing that the Commandos would suffer a devastating battle against Hydra forces after they left.{{r|Secret Warriors #19}}

Having won his secret war against Hydra and [[Leviathan (Earth-616)|Leviathan]], Nick Fury pulled together all of the surviving members of the Secret Warriors and Howling Commandos together into a new organization sponsored by the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]]. Team Black now served in this organization under the overall command of [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Quake]].{{r|Secret Warriors #28}}

===S.H.I.E.L.D.===
====Psy-Ops Department and Secret Avengers Initiative====
Ellis became part of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier Iliad|Iliad]] {{M|S.H.I.E.L.D. Psi Division (Earth-616)|Psy-Ops Department}},{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 6}} under [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] and Johnson. As part of the [[Secret Avengers (S.H.I.E.L.D.) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers Initiative]], Ellis would transmit the "Reverie" codeword controlling agents' memory implants. The unique nature of [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster's]] memory structure sometimes made him difficult to trigger.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 5|7}}

====Moth Squadron====
Ellis was later part of the {{m|Moth Squadron}}, along with fellow Caterpillars [[Cornell Gray (Earth-616)|Grey]] (from Team Black) and [[Elena Rodr√≠guez (Earth-616)|Slingshot (Yo-Yo)]], along with [[Agent Kellam (Earth-616)|Kellam]] and another agent, led by Quake. Together, they monitored [[New Attilan]].{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 1}}

While on this assignment, they were re-dispatched by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|Captain America]] (secretly leader of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]) to [[Inner Harbor|Baltimore Harbor]], to investigate a base, where they were ambushed by the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]]. She was seemingly killed in the brawl along all her team, save for Quake.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 1}}
