| History                 = ===Origin===
Ralph Roberts was a scientist who had been studying the effects of nuclear radiation involving cobalt. He sought to use this as a weapon and began designing a suit, which he planned to give to the military as opposed to [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]. Upon completion, he called himself the Cobalt Man. When he first put on the suit, he was suffering from a concussion, because he had injured himself in a pole jump competition with his brother [[Theodore Roberts (Earth-616)|Ted]]. Because of his head injury, he became obsessed with defeating Iron Man.{{r|X-Men #31}} He was defeated by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] before his unstable suit could explode.{{r|X-Men #34}}{{r|X-Men #138}}

===Hulk===
Ralph finally achieved superhuman size and power due to being bombarded with radiation. However, this was slowly killing him and he decided to show the world the dangers of nuclear power by destroying himself and the city of [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. He later seemingly died in a fight with the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], when thrown safely away from the planet.{{r|Incredible Hulk #173}}{{r|Incredible Hulk #174}}

===Emissaries of Evil===
He was later brainwashed to serve [[Elihas Starr (Earth-616)|Egghead]] as part of his [[Emissaries of Evil (Egghead) (Earth-616)|Emissaries of Evil]] and fought the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]]. Roberts was believed to have been killed in a nuclear explosion while trying to escape from Egghead. He later turned up alive battling the Hulk, who violently smashed him with a car. {{r|Defenders #42}}{{r|Defenders #43}}{{r|Hulk: Nightmerica #1}}

===Impostors and Tributes===
Ralph seemingly returned from the dead but it was later revealed this was really a [[Ralph Roberts (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Skrull Impostor]]. When interrogated by [[Khn'nr (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] about the [[Skrull]]'s [[Secret Invasion]] plans, the Skrull told him that he was not the real [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 6 2}} One of his suits was acquired and modified by a distraught man seeking to reconcile with his girlfriend. The newly named [[Bobby Lame Wolf (Earth-616)|Cobalt Tomahawk]] tried to rob an arizona reservation casino only to be stopped by [[Jason Strongbow (Earth-616)|American Eagle]].{{r|Thunderbolts #112}} Later, a group of men wearing cheap knockoffs of the Cobalt Man suit attacked surviving New Warrior [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Speedball]] in retaliation for the Stamford massacre, calling themselves the [[Cobalt Men (Earth-616)|Cobalt Men]].{{r|Avengers Academy #10}}

===Hades===
During [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]]' journey to the [[Hades (Underworld)|Hades]] the underworld, Cobalt Man was seen gambling for his resurrection.{{r|Incredible Hercules #129}} He was later seen as a member of [[Hades (Earth-616)|Pluto]]'s jury alongside [[Nessus (Earth-616)|Nessus]], [[Orka (Earth-616)|Orka]], [[Eric Hertz (Earth-616)|Armless Tiger Man]], [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Abomination]], [[Steven Levins (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern]], [[Scourge (Delazny) (Earth-616)|Scourge of the Underworld]], [[Heinrich Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], [[Kyknos (Earth-616)|Kyknos]], [[Artume (Earth-616)|Artume]] and [[Veranke (Earth-616)|Veranke]] for Zeus' trial.{{r|Incredible Hercules #130}}

===Marvel NOW!===
Ralph Roberts was later resurrected and retired from villainy. He was forced back into action after being targeted by [[Umbral Dynamics (Earth-616)|Umbral Dynamics]] for his radioactive suit. He was captured by [[Mercs for Money (Earth-616)|Mercs for Money]] and taken into Umbral Dynamics custody. Once the Mercs realized Umbral was actually evil, they stormed their headquarters in [[Bagalia]] and set free all the radioactive-based superhumans imprisoned there, including Cobalt Man. {{r|Deadpool & the Mercs for Money Vol 2 3}}{{r|Deadpool & the Mercs for Money Vol 2 5}}
