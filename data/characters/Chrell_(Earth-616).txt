===Origin===
'''Chrell''' was once a training instructor for [[Super-Skrull variants (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull Program]] trainees, such as; [[X'iv (Earth-616)|X'iv]], [[Xavin (Earth-616)|Xavin]], and even [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Kl'rt]].

===[[Secret Invasion]]===
Despite original lacking any beliefs, Chrell joined the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion Force]] against [[Earth-616|Earth]], where he began to hunt down the two [[Skrulls|Skrull Princes]]; [[Xavin (Earth-616)|Xavin]] and [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Dorrek VIII]].

However despite being able to take down the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]], Chrell struggled against [[Xavin (Earth-616)|Xavin]], [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Dorrek VIII]], [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]], [[Thomas Shepherd (Earth-616)|Speed]] and [[Karolina Dean (Earth-616)|Karolina Dean]]; because of this he required the assistance of the [[Skrulls|Skrull]] assassin [[X'iv (Earth-616)|X'iv]].

Although not even the assassin's help was enough, thus Chrell decided to go supernova. Unfortunately for Chrell, the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaway]] [[Xavin (Earth-616)|Xavin]] was able to contain his supernova and thus he only succeeded in killing himself.{{Citation}}
