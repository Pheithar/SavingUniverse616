===Origin===
After the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] fell under [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] authority and [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Steve Rogers]] began his obsessive hunt for the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]], numerous Avengers left the team, refusing to hunt down fellow heroes.

Several of these former Avengers created a new team led by [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]], as an external party to the Illuminati/S.H.I.E.L.D. conflict and to focus exclusively on a countermeasure against the [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]] that threatened the existence of Earth and the universe.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}}

Using [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]]'s resources, Sunspot managed to put into operation a machine capable of transporting individuals across the [[Multiverse]], in hopes of finding the source of the decay of the Multiverse, and a group of them, the "Multiversal Avengers," embarked in said mission.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 36}} Meanwhile, he also began recollecting the mechanisms put in the Earth by [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]], self-sustenance in the form of the [[Children of the Sun]], self-defense in the form of [[Aikku Jokinen (Earth-616)|Pod]], evolution in the form of [[Validator (Earth-616)|Validator]], and the power of replication, seized by [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 38}}

===Multiversal Avengers: Contact with the [[Black Priests (Multiverse)|Black Priests]]===
The Multiversal Avengers finally arrived to the base of the [[Black Priests (Multiverse)|Black Priests]], whom they believed to be enemies, as they would destroy alternate Earths. Both sides fought each other until [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] revealed himself as the leader of the Priests and stopped the conflict. Back to his Sanctum, Stephen explained them the true intention of the Black Priests, that to save the Multiverse instead of destroy it, even if their methods included the destruction of Earths.

Shortly before their encounter, Strange had convinced his fellow Black Priests the need to attack their enemies, the [[Beyonders|Ivory Kings]] (also known as the Beyonders) and [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Rabum Alal]], so he offered to help the Avengers face them. In order to get to the Ivory Kings, it was needed to get hold of one of their [[Mapmakers (Multiverse)|Mapmakers]], and in order to get to Rabum Alal, it was needed to get hold of one of his [[Black Swans (Multiverse)|Black Swans]]. The Avengers would go get one of them, while the Black Priests tried to get the other.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 27}}

The Avengers traveled across numerous universes, navigating the map left by the [[Mapmakers (Multiverse)|Mapmakers]]. After one last jump across universes that cost [[Adam Blackveil (Earth-616)|Nightmask]]'s life, the Avengers found themselves face to face with a fissure in time and space. From it, two [[Beyonders]] emerged and demanded the heroes to fall back. Upon denying their request, the Avengers faced the Beyonders. In an attempt to reprogram one of the Beyonders, Abyss and the Ex Nihili sacrificed themselves, and after being stabbed by the second Beyonder, Star Brand used his last breath to unleash the energy within him and destroy it. The only surviving Avengers, Odinson and Hyperion found themselves against an incoming wave of countless of Beyonders, and faced their deaths with delight.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 32}}

===New Avengers: Interrupting the S.H.I.E.L.D./Illuminati conflict===
As [[Valeria Richards (Earth-616)|Val Richards]] had informed [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|her father]] that the Illuminati couldn't win in their actions, he and his peers decided to set a trap to S.H.I.E.L.D. by letting them track the group in their safe-house of [[Cádiz]], [[Spain]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 39}}

As the Archangel Helicarriers stationed over the safe-house and [[War Machine Drones (Earth-616)|War Machine Drones]], [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] were deployed against the Illuminati, Sunspot brought his own ship over the Helicarriers and ordered S.H.I.E.L.D. to stand down.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 39}} As a response, Rogers deployed the lobotomized [[Robert Bruce Banner (Earth-14325)|Hulk]] from an [[Earth-14325|alternate dimension]]. Steve Rogers arrived to the battle field, where he confronted the Illuminati, and deployed the Mighty Avengers. The Mighty Avengers and the Avengers engaged the Illuminati and Sunspot's Avengers in combat until the Invisible Woman stopped the conflict.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 28}} Once the Illuminati and Steve Rogers came into terms, they started working together with Sunspot's Avengers.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 29}}

===Avengers Idea Mechanics===
In the following months, the universe was destroyed as a consequence of the incursions and was brought back, with the inhabitants having no memory of their temporary demise.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 #1|9}} Bobby completed his takeover of A.I.M. by renaming the company to [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|Avengers Idea Mechanics]], turning it into a group dedicated to international rescue operations, backed up by Sunspot's Avengers, now known as the "New Avengers."{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 1}}

Following several adventures, the new A.I.M. was forced to respond to an emergency call from [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]], a hacktivist who had been captured by S.H.I.E.L.D.. Due to the action of retrieving Jones from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody was considered an act of war, Sunspot allowed the members of his organization to vote whether to accept or refuse to partake in this mission. Da Costa decided to exile those who opposed the idea for their own good. Thus, Sunspot exiled Hulkling, Wiccan and Squirrel Girl, and bequeathed the name of the New Avengers to them.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 8}}

Even though the young heroes attempted to make a name for themselves, and enlisted [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] in the process,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 11}} they soon heeded a call for help from Sunspot.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 12}} After freeing [[Melissa Gold (Earth-616)|Songbird]] from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody on da Costa's behalf,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 15}} the New Avengers also assisted A.I.M. in fending off the [[New Revengers (Earth-616)|New Revengers]] from [[Avenger Base Two]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 16}}

With Hawkeye having left the team after being put in trial for the murder of [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]],{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 13}} and Squirrel Girl deciding to rejoin A.I.M. to keep an eye on Sunspot, Hulkling and Wiccan disbanded the team.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 18}}

| Notes                   = * During ''Time Runs Out'', this team of Avengers were seemingly separated in two divisions:
** The '''New Avengers''', composed of [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]], [[Eden Fesi (Earth-616)|Manifold]], [[Aikku Jokinen (Earth-616)|Pod]], [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]], [[Isabel Kane (Earth-616)|Smasher]], [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]], [[Validator (Earth-616)|Validator]], [[Children of the Sun|Zebra Kids]], and Sunspot himself. They are seemingly tasked in stopping the [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]/[[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] conflict and uniting the Avengers. 
** The '''Multiversal Avengers,''' composed of [[Abyss (Ex Nihilo's) (Earth-616)|Abyss]], the [[Gardeners|Ex Nihili]] (including [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]]), [[Marcus Milton (Earth-13034)|Hyperion]], [[Adam Blackveil (Earth-616)|Nightmask]], [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Odinson]] and [[Kevin Connor (Earth-616)|Star Brand]], who all went on a one-way trip through the [[Multiverse]] to find the cause of (or the [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|person]] responsible for){{r|Avengers Vol 5 38}} the Incursions and the Multiverse decay.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 36}}
** This division has been confined to the resumes as far, and it is unknown if they are the official names of these teams.
