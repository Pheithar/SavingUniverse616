===Early Life===
'''Noah Black''' was a brilliant geneticist who was awarded a Nobel Prize in the 1930s.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD Vol 1 2}} He attended a conference on genetics in the 1930s along with other noted geneticists in the world such as [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|Herbert Wyndham]], [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]], and [[Wladyslav Shinski (Earth-616)|Wladyslav Shinski]].{{r|X-Factor Annual #3}}

===Centurius===
[[File:Noah Black (Earth-616) from Thunderbolts Vol 1 156 0001.png|thumb|left|200px]]Sometime after winning the Prize, Black went mad, taking the name "Centurius" and seeing himself as the self-proclaimed savior of Earth, and retreated to remote Valhalla Island to conduct genetic experiments. On the island he was successful in evolving numerous monstrous creatures. During the transport of his newly created life forms to an orbiting space ark, [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents, [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] and [[James Woo (Earth-616)|Jimmy Woo]], by chance discovered Centurius' island where they were forced to crash land their aircraft.

The pair of agents initially attempted to convince Centurius to return to civilization with them, but when the geneticist's plot to destroy all life on Earth was revealed, Fury and his companions attack. In a ploy to defeat the agents, Centurius attempted to transform himself into a "superior being" using a device called the "Evolutionizer", but instead of evolving he "de-evolved" into a handful of protoplasmic slime.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD Vol 1 2}}{{r|Astounding Stories #152}}

===Conspiracy===
Later, Centurius somehow "re-evolved" into human form and as a member of the group known as the [[Conspiracy (Earth-616)|Conspiracy]]; he clashed with the heroic monster hunter [[Ulysses Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Ulysses Bloodstone]] when the Conspiracy tried to gain untold power by gathering and reuniting the lost fragments of the [[Bloodgem]], a mystic jewel from another dimension. However, The Conspiracy's efforts ultimately failed when their essences were absorbed by an enormous crystalline creature created from the Bloodgem. Ulysses Bloodstone succeeded in shattering the Bloodgem creature which apparently killed Centurius and the other members of the Conspiracy.{{r|Rampaging Hulk Vol 1 #1|5}}{{r|Rampaging Hulk Vol 1 #7|8}}

Years later, [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] discovered the skeletal remains of Centurius while exploring the Conspiracy's abandoned underground base.{{r|Captain America #358}}

===The Raft===
Much later, Centurius was found to not be dead after all and held as a prisoner at the [[Raft]], a prison for super powered criminals. He was able to escape the prison with numerous other inmates.{{r|New Avengers #1}}{{r|New Avengers #4}}

===Hood's Gang===
Centurius, along with many of the other escaped inmates, eventually became a member of [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|The Hood]]'s [[Hood's Gang (Earth-616)|crime syndicate]].{{r|New Avengers Annual #2}} During an attack on the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]]' headquarters by the crime syndicate, Centurius was incapacitated by the sorcerer [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] and taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.{{r|New Avengers #46}}{{r|New Avengers #50}} The Hood and his motley army recovered, his army unhappy with the Hood's leadership.{{r|New Avengers #55}} The Hood put Centurius, [[Curtis Carr (Earth-616)|Chemistro]], [[Douglas Birely (Earth-616)|Demonicus]], the [[Aaron Nicholson (Earth-616)|Answer]], and [[Arthur Parks (Earth-616)|Living Laser]] on a special project, promising to be in touch soon.{{r|Dark Reign: The Hood #1}} During the [[Secret Invasion]], he was among the many supervillains who rejoined the Hood's crime syndicate and attacked an invading [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrull]] force. He joined with the Hood's Gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]] instead.{{r|Dark Reign: The Hood #2}} Centurius partied at one of Hood's safehouses and passed out after drinking too much.{{r|Dark Reign: The Hood #4}}

He was later seen conferring with the Hood regarding the [[Zombies|zombie virus]]. Centurius advised the Hood not to pursue the virus, but the Hood was compelled by [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]] to procure the virus from [[Desmond Drew (Earth-616)|Black Talon]] despite Black's warnings.{{r|Marvel Zombies 4 #2}} 

A furious Hood returned to his army and killed [[Jonas Harrow (Earth-616)|Jonas Harrow]] for his betrayal. Hood chided the criminals for their panicked actions, and told them they now had to follow [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s orders. Osborn told them to hunt the [[Superhuman Registration Act|unregistered heroes]] and bring them back, dead or alive.{{r|New Avengers #60}} The Hood used the [[Norn Stones]] to give those in his army the ability to track down the targeted heroes, increasing their own strength and power as well.{{r|New Avengers #61}}

===Thunderbolts===
[[File:Thunderbolts and Beta Team (Earth-616) from Thunderbolts Vol 1 158 pg 20.png|right|thumb]]
Doc Century was later selected by Luke Cage to be a part of the "beta team" of the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], alongside [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]], [[Herman Schultz (Earth-616)|Shocker]], [[Gunna Sijurvald (Earth-616)|Gunna]], and [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mister Hyde]].{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 #156|162}}

===Traveling to the Past===
[[File:Noah Black (Earth-616) and Steven Rogers (Earth-616) from Thunderbolts Vol 1 164 0001.jpg|left|thumb]]
He escaped together with several other inmates who were members of the Thunderbolts. Due to a failure of the teleportation technology of their tower, caused by [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]], the tower began to move in time as well as in space. They ended up in [[World War II]] teaming up with the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]] to battle the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazis]].{{r|Thunderbolts #163|165}} They next end up in Victorian [[London (England)|London]].{{r|Thunderbolts #166|168}} They went even further back in time ending up in [[Arthur Pendragon (Earth-616)|King Arthur]]'s court in [[Camelot]].{{r|Thunderbolts #169}}

[[File:Noah Black (Earth-616) from Thunderbolts Vol 1 173 0001.jpg|right|thumb]]
They eventually bounced back to when the original [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Zemo]] lead the Thunderbolts team.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 #170|172}} After the [[Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|Fixer]] killed his younger self, this began to cause a collapse in reality which forced Fixer to assume his younger self's place. Centurius returned to the future with the rest of the Thunderbolts.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 #173|174}}{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 #176|183}}

===Return to Hood's Gang===
Centurius attended a meeting of various villains organized by the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]] to discuss what to do about [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] who had unexpectedly decided to become a superhero and become the new [[Iron Man]]. As the Hood brought up the idea of forming a gang of villains to take Doom out, Doom suddenly appeared and took down all of the villains present.{{r|Infamous Iron Man Vol 1 7}} He later participated in an ambush against Doom along with many of the other villains that Doom had earlier defeated.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 594}} He also attended another meeting to discuss Hood's rise as the new Kingpin of crime{{r|Defenders Vol 5 10}} before joining Hood's Gang once more in ransacking [[Castle Doom (Doomstadt)|Castle Doom]] in search for Doom's fortune.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 597|598}}
