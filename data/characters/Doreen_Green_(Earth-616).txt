===Early Life===
[[File:Doreen Green (Earth-616), Maureen Green (Earth-616) and Dorian Green (Earth-616) from Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 16 001.jpg|thumb|left|Baby Doreen]]
Doreen Green was born to [[Dorian Green (Earth-616)|Dorian]] and [[Maureen Green (Earth-616)|Maureen Green]]. She suffered a modification in her genes for unknown reasons that granted her squirrel-like abilities, which manifested predominantly in the form of a prehensile tail. When her parents consulted with a doctor, it was determined that Doreen wasn't a [[Homo superior|mutant]], even though she believed so for a long time.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 1}}

When she was ten years old, Doreen discovered she could communicate with squirrels after overhearing one of these rodents in her window. She subsequently saved this squirrel from being chased by a dog, and they became friends. The squirrel, who identified himself as [[Monkey Joe (Earth-616)|Monkey Joe]], encouraged Doreen to use her abilities to help people. Ever since then, Doreen began to fantasize about becoming a superhero, and came up with the alias of the "Unbeatable Squirrel Girl."{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 16}}

===First Adventures===
When she was fourteen, Doreen ambushed [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] in a [[California]] forest near [[Stark Enterprises Headquarters]] and hoped to impress the veteran hero, wishing him to take her under his wing as his sidekick. Unimpressed, Iron Man politely declined, when suddenly the duo was attacked by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] in a large aircraft. Doom captured and subdued Iron Man, and began to fly out over the [[Pacific Ocean]] where he planned to dispose of Iron Man's body once he killed him. Underestimating her, Doom left Squirrel Girl to her own devices. She devised a plan and used her ability to communicate with squirrels through an open door as the ship passed over the forest. Hundreds of squirrels answered her call and flooded Doom's ship, chewing through the wires, and swamping the evil dictator with their furry bodies. Iron Man was freed, they emerged victoriously, and the two heroes went their separate ways.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes Vol 2 8}}

[[File:Doreen Green and Victor von Doom (Earth-616) from Marvel Super-Heroes Vol 2 8.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Defeating Doom]]
Shortly after her fifteenth birthday, Squirrel Girl assisted was the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], who landed unconscious one day next to her treehouse in the middle of a fight against the [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Abomination]]. A concussion had blinded the Hulk, so he had to reluctantly accept Squirrel Girl's help. After swarming Abomination with squirrels, Doreen directed Hulk how to move to land punches and dodge attacks until the villain was knocked out.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 16}}

===Great Lakes Avengers===
Squirrel Girl later relocated to [[New York City]]. While fighting crime in [[Central Park]], she saved the [[Great Lakes Avengers (Earth-616)|Great Lakes Avengers]] from muggers, for which the GLA recruited her. Alongside her new teammates, Squirrel Girl witnessed the death of [[Douglas Taggert (Earth-616)|Grasshopper]] and became very frightened, but was determined not to give up. Thanks to her squirrel army, Squirrel Girl was able to help stop [[Maelstrom (Earth-616)|Maelstrom]] from destroying the world.{{r|G.L.A. Vol 1 1}}

After Squirrel Girl made a fuss to be certain that Monkey Joe was an official member of the team, he was apparently killed by Doctor Doom seeking revenge. In actuality, this was a rejected member of the GLA named [[Gene Lorrene (Earth-616)|Leather Boy]] in a variation of Dr. Doom's costume. Squirrel Girl found a new squirrel companion, the only one of her squirrel army who had survived Maelstrom's wrath, whom she named [[Tippy-Toe (Earth-616)|Tippy Toe]].{{r|G.L.A. Vol 1 2|4}}

[[File:Doreen Green (Earth-616) and Monkey Joe (Earth-616) from G.L.A. Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|right|thumb|180px]]
Squirrel Girl and Tippy Toe managed to individually defeat [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]], [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax]], and [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]]. [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu]], the Earth's [[Watchers|Watcher]], was on hand to confirm that the Thanos she defeated was the real thing, and not [[Thanosi (Earth-616)|a clone or copy]] of any kind.

After M.O.D.O.K.'s defeat, [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum-Dum Dugan]] offered Squirrel Girl a position at [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], explaining that they'd been watching her for some time and found her to be one of the most effective people ever at defeating powerful supervillains. Squirrel Girl declined the offer, saying she was happy being with the GLA.{{r|GLX-Mas Special Vol 1 1}} 

===The Thing===
While visiting squirrel friends in Central Park, Squirrel Girl came across [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|the Thing]] fighting with [[Bi-Beast (Earth-616)|Bi-Beast]]. She told the squirrels to retrieve the smelliest garbage they could find and place it around the combatants, resulting in everyone having to hold their noses. Bi-Beast had to use both hands to hold his noses, leaving himself defenseless and allowing Thing to knock him out.{{r|Thing Vol 2 8}}

===Great Lakes Champions===
[[File:Doreen Green (Earth-616) and Thanos (Earth-616) from GLX-Mas Special Vol 1 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Defeating Thanos]]
Squirrel Girl and the rest of the newly-renamed Great Lakes Champions, who took the name after winning a poker game, registered under the Superhero Registration Act the morning the law was enacted. However, mercenary-for-hire [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], assuming the Champions were non-registered, attacked the team at their headquarters (Deadpool sought to ingratiate himself with the government by capturing non-registered heroes). Deadpool was bested in combat by Squirrel Girl; his distraction at her appearance and name contributed to his inability to mount an adequate defense to her attacks.{{r|Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 30}}

Deadpool and the GLA would later team up a few months later to take down [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] agents who had kidnapped a wayward Olympian God and fashioned an inebriation ray that made every superhero on the planet (save for Deadpool and the GLI) drunk. After the battle, Deadpool decided to hang around the GLI's new government-funded headquarters, as a "reserve member" for a while.{{r|Deadpool GLI - Summer Fun Spectacular Vol 1 1}}

===Confronting Speedball===
Squirrel Girl was a huge fan of the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]], especially [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Robbie "Speedball" Baldwin]], on whom she had a crush.{{r|I (heart) Marvel: Masked Intentions Vol 1 1}} She learned of Speedball's transformation into the darker hero code-named Penance after Deadpool provided her with a copy of {{cl|Civil War: Front Line Vol 1 10}}. Squirrel Girl traveled to [[Thunderbolts Mountain]] to convince Robbie to lighten up and stop being Penance. Frustrated by his current attitude and unwavering determination to remain as Penance, Squirrel Girl traveled to [[Latveria]] to use one of Doctor Doom's time machines to travel to the past and prevent Speedball from ever becoming Penance. The machine instead transported her into the future, where she encountered an alternate version of Speedball (whom she unsuccessfully tried to get to travel back to the past with her), and [[Craig Hollis (Earth-616)|Mister Immortal]], who told her she had an important task to perform in the past — namely, kicking Deadpool out of the Great Lakes Initiative's headquarters.{{r|Deadpool GLI - Summer Fun Spectacular Vol 1 1}}

===Secret Invasion===
When the [[Skrulls]] launched their invasion on Earth, Squirrel Girl and the GLI confronted their latest recruit, the new [[Grasshopper (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Grasshopper]], who had revealed himself as a Skrull infiltrator.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 19}} Some time after the invasion was over, Squirrel Girl and her teammates welcomed [[Greg Willis (Earth-616)|Gravity]] to the GLI when he was relocated from [[Nevada (State)|Nevada]] to [[Wisconsin (State)|Wisconsin]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 25}}

===Heroic Age===
[[File:Doreen Green & Danielle Cage (Earth-616) from New Avengers Annual Vol 2 1.jpg|thumb|right|Doreen protecting Danielle Cage]]
Squirrel Girl eventually realized that she was holding back her teammates, who wouldn't join her in fighting supervillains because she was competent enough to beat them on her own. After defeating [[Fin Fang Foom (Earth-616)|Fin Fang Foom]] while her teammates remained at their HQs calmly playing poker, she decided to unceremoniously leave the GLI and go solo.{{r|Age of Heroes Vol 1 3}} She would return to [[New York City]] not long after that.{{r|I Am an Avenger Vol 1 1}}

===Danielle Cage's Nanny===
Doreen was hired to be the nanny of [[Danielle Cage (Earth-616)|Danielle Cage]] and lived in the [[Avengers Mansion]] alongside the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 7}} She looked after the baby through many events, most notably the [[Fear Itself|Serpent's invasion]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 16}} When [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] left the team, she followed him and [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]], as she was still the nanny of their child.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 34}}

===ESU Student===
After leaving Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, Doreen started living secretly in the attic of the Avengers Mansion until she enrolled in the [[Empire State University]]. During her first day of class she encountered who would become her best friend and confidante, [[Nancy Whitehead (Earth-616)|Nancy Whitehead]], and her cat [[Mewnir (Earth-616)|Mew]]. Doreen also confronted [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]], and convinced him to give up on his vendetta against [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 1 1}} The first major threat that Doreen averted during her stay at ESU was [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]], whom Doreen managed to intercept as he was approaching the Earth. After bonding with Galactus, Doreen found him [[Nutopia XXIV]], a moon completely forested with nut-bearing trees, which sated his hunger.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 1 4}} 

While at ESU, Doreen developed a crush on one of her first few acquaintances at the university, [[Tomas Lara-Perez (Earth-616)|Tomas Lara-Perez]],{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 1 2}} later revealed to be the superhero Chipmunk Hunk, who possessed similar powers to Squirrel Girl's, and fought crime together with his friend [[Ken Shiga (Earth-616)|Ken Shiga]], also known as [[Koi Boi]]. Both Chipmunk Hunk and Koi Boi became Doreen's friends and allies.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 1 6}} 

During her second year at college,{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 1}} Doreen became a member of [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]]'s [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|New Avengers]],{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 1}} and transitioned into the [[U.S.Avengers (Earth-616)|U.S.Avengers]] when Sunspot began working for S.H.I.E.L.D. and the American intelligence service.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 1}} Doreen also assisted the supervillain [[Werner Schmidt (Brain Drain) (Earth-616)|Brain Drain]] in reforming and becoming a good-doer himself.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 1}} During her subsequent adventures, Doreen most notably confronted Doctor Doom in the past{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 #2|5}} and stopped the multiplying villain [[Enigmo (Earth-616)|Enigmo]] from taking over the United States.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 #12|14}} For a brief time, Doreen received mentoring and was even gifted a flying suit from entrepreneur [[Melissa Morbeck (Earth-616)|Melissa Morbeck]], though it turned to be part of an intricate plan of world domination.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 #17|20}} During a trip to the [[Savage Land]], Doreen teamed-up with Kraven the Hunter to fight a version of [[Ultron (Oak Tree) (Earth-616)|Ultron]], which cemented him as an ally of Squirrel Girl, and swayed him from the path of villainy.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 #22|25}}

[[File:Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 16 Brigman Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Doreen and her allies]]

At some point, Squirrel Girl was able to examine [[Vincent Doonan (Earth-616)|Vincent Doonan]] and study his [[Doombot]] technology in exchange for hanging out with [[Gwendolyn Poole (Earth-TRN565)|Gwenpool]]. The two have also teamed-up to rescue Gwen's brother, [[Ted Poole, Jr. (Earth-TRN565)|Teddy Poole]], from [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]]'s [[Mephisto's Realm|realm]].{{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 25}} Gwenpool later remembered that incident fondly while speaking at Doreen's funeral, which was held after a [[G'illian Blax'zthor (Earth-616)|Skrull]] had staged her death.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 37}} During the [[War of the Realms]], Doreen was sent on a secret mission by [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] to save [[North America]] from the [[Frost Giants]].{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 43}} She ran into [[Ratatoskr (Earth-616)|Ratatoskr]] and the two worked together,{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 44}} eventually managing to drive away the Frost Giants back to [[Jotunheim]] by sparking a political revolution against their monarchy.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 46}}

Shortly afterward, Doreen's life was torn apart by Melissa Morbeck. After escaping prison and laying the groundwork for her revenge, Melissa outed Doreen's identity to the public and blew up her apartment.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 47}} Doreen and her allies were lured to Central Park, where Melissa took over Iron Man's armor to embrace the new identity of Iron Ring, also revealing an alliance of many villains previously defeated by Doreen, including Doctor Doom.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 48}} The tide of the battle shifted several times, with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] arriving to help, and Melissa outfitting her allies with Iron Man suits in return. When Galactus became aware of the fight, he teleported many of the villains reformed by Doreen to her aid, but she almost died after shielding a bomb planted by Doom.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 49}} Galactus personally appeared to stop the fight, disarming the villains and teleporting them to prison at Doreen's request. As she moved into a new chapter of her life, Doreen decided to embrace her public identity since it allowed her to live more truthfully.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 50}}

| Notes                   = * Squirrel Girl was 14 years old at the time of her first appearance and announced that her birthday is sometime in July.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 1 1}} As of {{cl|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 16}}, she was 20 years old.
* Squirrel Girl's first appearance was almost assured to be her last, given the silliness of the character's concept, especially in the grittier and more grown up comic market trend of the early 1990s. She existed primarily as a matter of trivia, or an example of an extremely bad character, for the next decade. Her only known appearance during this time was as the pattern on a pair of underwear worn by the comedic character [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 7}}

| Trivia                  = * As of {{cl|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 47}}, Doreen was 20 years old, having celebrated her 20th birthday in {{cl|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 16}}.
* Doreen's name comes from her parents Dorian and Maureen mashing their names together after they got stuck on what to call her.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 1}}[[File:New Avengers (Earth-616), Danielle Cage (Earth-616), and Doreen Green (Earth-616) from New Avengers Vol 2 7 0001.jpg|thumb|right]]
* The necklace with the letters "MJ" that Doreen wears in {{cl|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 1 1}} was confirmed to be an homage to her late squirrel friend [[Monkey Joe (Earth-616)|Monkey Joe]] in the letters page of {{cl|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 1 3}}.
* [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and Squirrel Girl seemingly crossed paths with each other (either a team-up or they dated) in an encounter that evidently ended poorly, as they had agreed to never see one another again.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 7}} Curiously, Squirrel Girl was present in Wolverine's mindscape together with [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], [[Rita Wayword (Earth-616)|Spiral]] and [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jewel]], in the portion which illustrated his sexual fantasies.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 8}}
* The fur that once made up her costume was fake, about which she remarked that she would never wear any clothing not deemed as "cruelty-free" and implied she was a member of PETA.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 19}}
* Squirrel Girl was stated to be a [[:Category:Low Threats|Low Threat]] by the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]].{{r|X-Men: The 198 Files Vol 1 1}}
* In number 87 of the pulp novel series ''The Destroyer'' "Mob Psychology" two young budding comic book artists "Jeter Baird" and Devin Western" (obvious pastiches of Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman, creators of ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'') discuss the various comic-book superheroes they have attempted and failed to publish. One of Jeter's is "Squirrel Girl" (and her real identity is "Doreen Green" "because that rhymes, too.") which didn't get into print because "Wonder Comics came out with Squirrel Woman."
* [[New Warriors Vol 1|''New Warriors'']] writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] planned for Squirrel Girl to join said series in the long run, at a time when the character had fallen into obscurity following her first appearance, and having her idolize Speedball. The idea didn't come through with Nicieza's departure from the book after issue #53. He would later introduce the idea of Squirrel Girl having a crush on Speedball a decade later in {{cl|I (heart) Marvel: Masked Intentions Vol 1 1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/squirrel-girl-new-warrior-member-20-years-ago-fabian-nicieza/|title=Was Squirrel Girl Almost a New Warrior...20 Years Ago?|work=CBR|first=Brian|last=Cronin|date=10 April 2017|accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref>
