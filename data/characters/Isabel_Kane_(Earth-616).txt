===Early Life===
Isabel "Izzy" Kane grew up on a farm on [[Iowa (State)|Iowa]]. After her mother died and her grandfather, the [[WWII]] hero [[Dan Kane (Earth-616)|Captain Terror]], became ill, Izzy returned from school in Colorado where she had been studying astronomy to help out on the farm, to her grandfather's displeasure since he wanted her to fulfil her dreams.

One day, Izzy found the [[Exospex]] of a [[Smasher (Imperial Guard)|Smasher]] on her farm. The Exospex spoke to her and beckoned her to put them on, giving her access to the Smasher's powers. Izzy travelled to [[Chandilar]] where she became a Subguardian of the [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]]. After returning home, Izzy found her grandfather dying. He told her to become a hero and gave her a business card he had received from his friend [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 5}}

[[File:Avengers Vol 5 5 Pacheco Variant Textless.jpg|left|thumb]]
===Avengers===
Captain America recruited her as part of the new, expanded [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers team]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 1}}
Izzy was called on her first mission after the core Avengers team was defeated on [[Mars]] by [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]], [[Abyss (Ex Nihilo's) (Earth-616)|Abyss]] and [[Aleph (Garden) (Earth-616)|Aleph]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 2}} Izzy fought Nihilo's forces alongside her fellow Avengers, and he eventually submitted to them after being ordered to by [[Tamara Devoux (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 3}}{{r|Avengers Vol 5 5}} Izzy later worked with the team to battle [[Adam Blackveil (Earth-616)|"Blackveil"]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 6}}

===Imperial Guard===
Later, she received an Imperial Alert from the [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Guard]] and took a team of Avengers to aid them. When the Guard's resident Superguardian [[Galin (Earth-616)|Smasher]] perished, Izzy was promoted as the new Superguardian by the [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Majestor]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 9}}

===Return to Earth===
The Avengers tried to rescue the Canadian super team [[Omega Flight (Heroes) (Earth-616)|Omega Flight]] who got lost in a Garden Origin Site.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 10}} They then encountered [[Superia]] who was working with [[A.I.M.]]{{r|Avengers Vol 5 14}} They then battled the [[Builders (Race)|Builders]], [[Gardeners]], [[Alephs]], and the [[Curators]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 17|18}}

===[[Infinity (Event)|Infinity]]===
During the [[Infinity (Event)|Builder War]], Smasher was one of the numerous Avengers recruited into battling the [[Builders (Race)|Builders]] with the help of numerous intergalactic empires.{{r|Infinity #1}} During this mission she fell in love and started dating fellow Avenger [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Sam Guthrie]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 #22}}

[[File:Isabel Kane (Earth-616) from Avengers World Vol 1 2 001.jpg|thumb|right|As the Messenger]]
===Messenger===
When the source of several mysterious seismic events was revealed to be [[Barbuda|A.I.M. Island]], Smasher went to investigate along with Cannonball and Sunspot. When they arrived to the location, they were captured.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 #25}}{{r|Avengers World #1}} Izzy was chosen by the [[Andrew Forson (Earth-616)|Scientist Supreme]] to become his Messenger for the secret of the universe, that "Everything dies."{{r|Avengers World #2}}{{r|Avengers Vol 5 #26|27}}{{r|Avengers World #5|6}}	

When the [[Next Avengers (Earth-10943)|Next Avengers]] from an [[Earth-10943|alternate future]] helped S.H.I.E.L.D., they used a device named "Sigkill" to erase of all A.I.M.'s data.{{r|Avengers World #11}} A strike team then attacked the Island as its defences quickly dropped. Isabel was slowly liberated from A.I.M.'s influence and became Smasher once more.{{r|Avengers World #14}}

===[[Time Runs Out]]===
Due to the distractions her heroic career caused, Izzy became pregnant with Cannonball's child. As soon as she discovered this, she was called to return to [[Chandilar]], the Shi'ar homeworld, with the Imperial Guard. Cannonball decided to follow her to the Imperial Guard's ship, with the help of the Starjammer, unwilling to let go of Izzy. After saving their ship from enemy forces, Izzy confessed to Sam that she was pregnant.{{r|Avengers World Vol 1 17}} Months after moving to Chandilar, the baby was supergestated, and in less than 8 months was already born,{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}} and he was named [[Josiah Guthrie (Earth-616)|Josiah]]. Once again on Earth, Izzy presented the baby to her father.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 36}}

===All-New, All Different===
Once the universe was destroyed,{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 1}} it ultimately came back.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 9}} The Shi'ar and the Imperial Guard were brought back as a byproduct of the universal renewal,{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 3}} with no memories of the universe's temporary demise, like the rest of the inhabitants of the universe.{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 1}}

Smasher was dispatched along with fellow Imperial Guard members [[Mentor III (Earth-616)|Mentor]] and [[Sybil (Oracle) (Earth-616)|Oracle]] to investigate the rebirth of the planet [[Archeopia]] after it was destroyed by the world devourer [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]]. Smasher used her penta-vision to check for any anomalies but came up with nothing. However, Mentor began to process the vast amounts of information from the environment and in conjunction with Oracle's telepathy determined that Galactus underwent another cosmic metamorphosis which caused the planet to be brought back to life. Smasher and the others went back to the [[Br'ynath]] to transmit this information back to Gladiator.{{r|Ultimates Vol 3 3}}

| Notes                   = * Originally, Smasher's name was given as "Isabel Dare," but in the collected edition which featured her first appearance in {{cl|Avengers Vol 5 5}}, they corrected her surname to "Kane." According to editor [[Tom Brevoort|Tom Brevoort]], this change was made on purpose, and even stated that "Dare was a mistake in the first place," as the character was intended to be [[Dan Kane (Earth-616)|Dan Kane]]'s granddaughter since the beginning.<ref>[http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/post/63878172632/has-izzy-dare-name-been-changed-to-kane-in-the-avengers New Brevoort Formspring]</ref>
