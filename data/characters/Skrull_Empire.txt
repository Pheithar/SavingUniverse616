| Overview            = The '''Skrull Empire''' is a vast intergalactic empire that dominates their home galaxy, the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] which has millions of inhabited worlds.{{r|Annihilation: Prologue Vol 1 1}}{{r|Annihilation: Nova Vol 1 4}} It is the oldest interstellar empire in the cosmos.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12}}

Some worlds have voluntarily joined the Skrull Empire and they have been granted varying degrees of autonomy. Other worlds were conquered and their inhabitants subjugated. The Skrulls have also expanded their dominion by colonizing uninhabited worlds.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12}} Within the Andromeda galaxy, the Skrulls have conquered or colonized every suitable world.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 19}} They have also established peace treaties with pacifist races, which they don't regard as being a threat to the empire. Profitable trading relationships are maintained with these worlds.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12}} It's an empire that has laid waste to a thousand galaxies.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 39}} 

Tens of millions of years ago they were already expanding into neighboring galaxies becoming an intergalactic empire.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 133}} In the modern era, the Skrulls control worlds throughout the Andromeda galaxy and in neighboring galaxies.{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files Vol 1 1}} While the total population of Skrulls is unknown, it's likely in the trillions.{{r|Marvel Fact Files Vol 1 2}} The Skrull capital was relocated to [[Tarnax IV]] from [[Skrullos]] a 100,000 years ago.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 10}} Currently the empire is ruled from [[Tarnax II]].{{r|Infinity Vol 1 6}}

| History                 = {{Main|Skrull Empire/Expanded History}}
===Early Years===
Aided by their shape-shifting powers, the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] departed their homeworld into space. When they encountered a new race, they simply transformed themselves to resemble that race. The empire that resulted from these contacts was based on free trade and mutual cooperation, the Skrullian Federation.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 133|134}} They had discovered that in the Local Group of galaxies, there wasn't a single race that approached their level of technology or knowledge. In exchange for the world's loyalty and technology, they were offered knowledge and technology. {{r|Captain America Annual #7}}{{r|Avengers Vol 1 133|134}} Their scientists also formed the first [[Cosmic Cube]] that later became the [[Shaper of Worlds (Earth-616)|Shaper of Worlds]].{{r|Captain America Annual #7}}

===Kree/Skrull War===
The Skrulls voyaged to the [[Milky Way]] and [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. In the latter cluster they discovered the [[Kree]] homeworld of [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]]. The Kree were in the dawn of their culture; at this point they shared Hala with the plant race, the [[Cotati]]. The Skrulls decided to favor one of the races with their advanced technology and devised a test to determine which would be the favored race.

The Skrulls created the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] and transported bands of Kree and Cotati there. Both groups were left to accomplish what they could. The Skrulls judged the Cotatiâ€™s works to be superior. This angered the Kree and led to a vicious attack in which the Kree band slew the Skrull judges and the Cotati. The Kree stole the Skrull's star-ship and technology. Because of the immense distances involved, decades passed before the Skrulls learned of the Kree's activities. By this time it was too late. The Kree had become advanced and audacious enough to attack the Skrulls in their home galaxy. During the millennia that followed, the Skrulls developed the vicious streak needed to conduct [[Kree-Skrull War|intergalactic war]]. Their entire culture was remade in the warrior image for the war.{{r|Avengers #133}} The Skrulls fought the Kree on a million worlds, in a war in which there was never a clear victor or loser. Due to the war, both the Skrulls and Kree prospered and grew stronger.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 134}} 

===Earth===
Skrulls became aware of [[Earth]] when they discovered a space warp linking Earth and Throneworld. Later they discovered that the Earth possessed an equidistant link to Hala. They saw Earth as a world to conquer but they were content to hold off a full invasion, perhaps afraid the Kree would learn of the plot. Because of their caution, the Skrulls sent only a handful of scout warriors to infiltrate Earth.{{Citation}}

[[File:Skrull Cows (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Vol 1 2 002.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The Skrull agents revealing how they imitated the FF]]

Fearing the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] would stand in their way of an invasion of Earth, [[Skrull Cows (Earth-616)|four Skrull agents]] came to Earth and posed as the team in order to ruin their reputation. The real Fantastic Four were able to expose the Skrull agents and clear their names. The Fantastic Four stole the [[Skrull-Ship (Water Tower)|Skrulls' rocket ship]] and found their mother-ship in Earth orbit. Posing as the Skrull agents, they tricked the captain into believing that Earth was too dangerous to invade. [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] "volunteered" to stay behind and remove any trace of the Skrulls' presence on Earth. Falling for Richard's deception, the captain called off the invasion. Once back on Earth the Fantastic Four hid the remaining Skrull agents by convincing them to transform into cows. Reed hypnotized them into believing they were real cows. They were left in a field to graze for the rest of their lives.{{r|Fantastic Four #2}}

Over the years, the Skrull empire sent many agents against Earth, including the [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]],{{r|Fantastic Four #18}}{{r|Fantastic Four #32}} [[Paibok (Earth-616)|Paibok the Power Skrull]],{{r|Fantastic Four #358}} [[Velmax (Earth-616)|Effigy]],{{r|Marvel: The Lost Generation #4}} [[Ethan Edwards (Earth-616)|Ethan Edwards]],{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #13|18}} and [[Skrull-X (Earth-616)|Skrull-X]].{{r|Fantastic Four #204}}

===End of the Kree/Skrull War===

During the Dark Phoenix crisis, Lilandra the Shi'ar Majestrix consulted both the Kree Supreme Intelligence and the Skrull Empress R'Klll regarding the current host of the Phoenix Force ([[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]]). They agreed to let the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] fight the Shi'ar [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]] in a honor duel to determine her fate. The Skrull warrior [[Raksor (Earth-616)|Raksor]] and the Kree warrior [[Bel-Dann (Earth-616)|Bel-Dann]] were assigned to monitor the fight and assure that the X-Men lost. Soon they turned on each other.{{r|X-Men Vol 1 137}}

For months they hunted and fought each other in the bowels of the [[Inhuman]] city of [[Attilan]]. [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu]] the Watcher took notice and informed the rulers of the Skrull and Kree Empires. After much thought and discussion, the two empires came to the conclusion that because of the vast galactic distance between them the eons old war had been a vast drain on the two empires. They were too evenly matched for either to achieve a decisive victory over the other. Empress R'Klll and the Supreme Intelligence agreed to let the fight between their two greatest warriors (the Skrull Raksor and the Kree Bel-Dann) to determine the winner of the war. The fighting continued for additional months, undermining the foundations of Attilan. Upon being advised of what was happening by Uatu, the Fantastic Four and the Inhumans manipulated the two to join forces against them and made it so that the heroes "lost" the fight. Uatu the Watcher then interceded, declared Earth the loser, and the Skrull and Kree Empires both winners ending the war.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 18}}

===Fall of an Empire===
[[File:Galan (Earth-616) and Frankie Raye (Earth-616) from New Avengers Vol 1 40 001.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Destruction of Tarnax IV]]
The Skrull throneworld was devoured by [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] and the Imperial starfleet destroyed by Galactus's herald, [[Frankie Raye (Earth-616)|Nova (Frankie Raye)]].{{r|Fantastic Four #257}} With the destruction of a central government, rebellions and chaos spread throughout the Andromeda galaxy. All the Skrull planetary governors declared themselves emperor or empress, and rallied their own forces. Weaker planets fell to stronger ones, and alliances were forged and broken within hours. In the first few days, more Skrulls died at the hands of Skrulls in the civil war than died in the consumed Throneworld.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 259}} Eventually, the Skrull warlord Gorth hired the space pirate [[Nebula (Earth-616)|Nebula]] who with a mercenary army (made up of outcasts of a thousand worlds, from multiple galaxies) invaded Skrull space and were unstoppable until meeting the Skrull general [[Zedrao (Earth-616)|Zedrao]] who had stayed out of the Skrull civil war and repelled her forces. With the assistance of the Avengers, he put an end to the threat that she posed to the Skrull Empire.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 258|260}}

The greatest blow to the Skrulls was the destruction of their shape-shifting powers for a time due to their Hyper-Wave Bomb which stabilized the deviant genetic code of all Skrulls everywhere that granted their abilities. This was accomplished by Reed Richards and yet another Governor-turned-Emperor.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #19}} The Skrull warlord [[Kylor (Earth-616)|Kylor]] began a new [[Second Kree-Skrull War|intergalactic conflict]] with the Kree upon the visit of a Celestial to his world and learning that the Kree had discovered that the Skrulls had lost their shapeshifting abilities.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 5}} The Skrull warlord [[S'Byll (Earth-616)|S'Byll]] and the [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]] manipulated the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] into fighting on the side of the Skrulls against the Kree and their [[Badoon]] allies. Using Skrull science they transferred some of the Silver Surfer's [[Power Cosmic]] to S'Byll, mutating her and giving her the ability to restore the Skrulls' natural abilities via touch.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 25}} Upon the conclusion of the war that ended in a truce, S'Byll who was now Empress moved the throneworld to her homeworld, [[Satriani]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 31}}

===Annihilation Wave and Secret Invasion===
The Skrull Empire was the first of the major interstellar empires to face the devastating [[Annihilation (Event)|interdimensional invasion]] from the [[Negative Zone]] led by [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]], which cut across vast swaths of Skrull space. Though the Skrulls fought heroically, they were unable to halt its advance. Within less than six months, the Skrull Empire was devastated.{{r|Annihilation #1}}{{r|Blockbusters of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 1}} The [[Annihilation Wave (Earth-616)|Annihilation Wave]]'s super weapon, the [[Harvester of Sorrow]], destroyed hundreds of Skrull planets.{{r|Annihilation: Super-Skrull #3}} In the aftermath the Skrulls unsuccessfully attempted to convince [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]] to become their new Emperor.{{r|Young Avengers #9|12}} 

With their empire shattered, the Skrull under the leadership of the religious extremist [[Veranke (Earth-616)|Queen Veranke]], infiltrated Earth to pave the way for a [[Secret Invasion|major invasion]] in an attempt to turn it into their new throneworld.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 40}} Several heroes were replaced by Skrulls. Eventually, Reed Richards was able to pierce through the shape-shifting and all heroes and villains banded together to stop the Skrulls. Unfortunately, the Skrulls activated a fail-safe within the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]], turning her into a biological weapon. [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] had no choice but to "destroy" her. Angered, the humans attacked the Skrulls, killing Veranke and destroying their fleet in orbit in retaliation.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 8}} All the missing heroes, villains and [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents were found alive and returned to Earth.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 8}}

===Infinity and the Empire Restored===
The Super-Skrull became one of many Warlords seeking to re-unite the divided Skrull territories, eventually growing in power and influence until he became one of the six most powerful Warlords. During the [[Infinity (Event)|devastating invasion]] of the various interstellar empires in the Local Group of galaxies by the mysterious [[Builders (Race)|Builders]], the Skrull Warlords united against this common foe. When news of a War Council of various galactic powers reached the Skrulls, Kl'rt was chosen to represent the Skrulls. An alliance was created, with Kl'rt commanding the Skrulls and playing a key role in the council.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 18}}
[[File:Kl'rt (Earth-616) from Infinity Vol 1 6 001.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Emperor Kl'rt{{r|Infinity #6}}]]
The war initially went poorly, but the alliance eventually managed to turn the tide and through a series of key battles, the Builders were defeated and the worlds occupied by them liberated.{{r|Infinity #5}} In order to repay the efforts of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] in the war, and seeking glory and great battle, Kl'rt accompanied Alliance forces to Earth in order to free it from occupation by [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]]. They succeeded in liberating [[Peak VII|The Peak]] and killing one of Thanos' lieutenants, [[Black Dwarf (Earth-616)|Black Dwarf]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 23}} After his great victory in the war against the Builders, Kl'rt was crowned Emperor of a reborn Skrull Empire, as the alien race now settled on the planet Tarnax II.{{r|Infinity #6}} Within a few years, the Skrull Empire withdrew from the Pan-Worlds Jurisdiction Treaty, which meant that the Nova Corps were no longer permitted to operate in the Skrull-dominated Andromeda galaxy.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Annual Vol 3 1}}

===Empyre===
Eventually as both the Kree and the Skrulls grew tired of their endless conflict, the Skrull Empire saw saw an opportunity to establish an alliance with the [[Kree Imperium]], since they would be more powerful when allied and so the two empires merged into the [[Kree/Skrull Alliance (Earth-616)|Alliance]].{{r|Incoming Vol 1 1}}

==The Empire==
===Government===
Ruling the Skrull empire is an absolute monarch, called an emperor or empress.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 18}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 209}} The imperial system under the emperor includes the:

* Chancellor{{r|Skrulls! Vol 1 1}}
* Imperial Council (which can give orders to generals){{r|Death of Captain Marvel Vol 1 1}}
* War Council{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 40}} 
* High Command (military){{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 206}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 358}}
* High Court (judicial){{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 206}}
* Prelates (in charge of quadrants){{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 262}}
* Governors (in charge of worlds){{r|Avengers Vol 1 259}}
* Priests of the Mind (telepaths of the Imperial Court){{r|New Avengers Vol 1 44}}
* Priests of the Sciences (of the Imperial Court){{r|New Avengers Vol 1 40}}
* Priests of the Magic{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 40}}

In every planet that is conquered or absorbed by the Skrull Empire, only one race is allowed to represent the inhabitants in the empire, which are the Skrulls.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 13}}

===Military===
The Skrull empire has a vast war machine. It is one that consists of an [[Skrull Imperial Starfleet (Earth-616)|imperial starfleet]] with 1000s of warships and the [[Skrull Army (Earth-616)|ground forces]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 96}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 5}}{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 25}}{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 1|8}} Possessing warships as large as small moons.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 358|359}} Warships with the firepower to devastate worlds.{{r|Force Works Vol 1 14}} Skrull ground forces possess vehicles with energy weapons powerful enough to kill Terran gods.{{r|Captain Britain and MI-13 Vol 1 2}} Skrullian military forces possess weapons that shatter planets or blow up stars.{{r|Runaways Vol 3 2}}{{r|Runaways Vol 3 12}}{{r|Avengers Vol 4 18}} They have the ability to wipe out whole species, weapons so terrifying the Skrulls refuse to use them. Which are kept as last resort doomsday weapons.{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1 3}} 

Skrull forces are organized into various types of units including fleets, legions, and squadrons.{{r|Secret Invasion: War of Kings Vol 1 1}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 19}}{{r|Force Works Vol 1 13|14}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 257}}{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 2}} Within they have branches that are specialized, including the "Sci-Ops Division", the "Engineering Corps", and the "Observation Corps".{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 1}}{{r|Skrulls! Vol 1 1}}{{r|Marvel: The Lost Generation Vol 1 4}}  They also have super-soldiers, the [[Super-Skrulls (Earth-616)|Super-Skrulls]] which is a force of thousands which has its own training facilities.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 5}}{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask Vol 1 6}} 

The supreme commander of the Skrull military is the emperor (or empress). Within the Skrull armed forces are many ranks which include General,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 258|260}} Chief Scientist,{{r|X-Men Vol 2 95}} Grand Commander,{{r|Secret Invasion: War of Kings Vol 1 1}} Major,{{r|Force Works Vol 1 13|14}}, Adjutant,{{r|Force Works Vol 1 13|14}} Captain,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 358}} Lieutenant,{{r|Captain America Vol 3 6}} Sergeant,{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 1}} Private,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 347}} and Ensign.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 24}}

All Skrulls join the military when they are of age.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 40}} Training for the warriors is brutal in the Skrullian armed forces, in which the weak perish and only the strong graduate.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 15}} Nobody is allowed to go AWOL, and those that do are pursued.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 40}} Deserters get a date with the executioner.{{r|X-Men Vol 3 29}} The Skrullian way of war is to show no mercy, shooting to kill.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 382}} Honor is measured by their victories and they are willing to kill civilians.{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men Vol 1 3}} 

Skrull warriors are ruthless but they are not unnecessarily cruel. To them obliterating a population for obliteration's sake is both distasteful and pointless.{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men Vol 1 1}} To avoid capture, Skrull warriors (especially operatives) may detonate themselves by use of an internal device that disintegrates the Skrull, turning the individual into ash.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 3}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 278}}{{r|Thor Vol 1 445}} Skrulls are known for being fanatical and fighting to the last warrior.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 7}} They will even commit mass suicide, destroying a fleet.{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men Vol 1 4}}

The Skrull military uses war chants in their programmed music (e.g. within ships) that are hours long and are used to stir their troops into a frenzy.{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1 4}} Dark Throne Military Installations are where the Skrull develop their most secretive weapons. Which are populated by the Skrull Empire's coldest scientists and their most hardened soldiers. Top secret installations that most Skrull military personnel are unaware of, lacking the necessary clearance.{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1 3}}

Skrull warriors also have a warrior code, though not all Skrull soldiers follow the code of honor. In one incident, Captain Britain and his MI-13 though surrounded by hundreds of Skrulls faced only an equal number of warriors.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 478}}{{r|Captain Britain and MI-13 Vol 1 1}} They respect and honor enemies who have shown great courage and skill in battle, such as the great Kree warrior [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Mar-Vell]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 2}}{{r|Death of Captain Marvel Vol 1 1}} Skrulls will also repay their debts, as Emperor Dorrek offered the Fantastic Four any boon they requested from him for saving his daughter.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 37}}

===Society===
At the top of Skrull society is the imperial sovereign ruler.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 18}} It is a society in which the elite have titles of nobility, including Baron (or Baroness) and Count (or Countess).{{r|Annihilation: Super-Skrull Vol 1 1}}{{r|Annihilation: Super-Skrull Vol 1 3}} Skrullian society is divided into castes, including; the Scientist caste,{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 4 10}} the Warrior caste,{{r|Infinity Vol 1 1}} and Worker caste.{{r|Infinity Vol 1 1}} Slavery is not practiced in the Skrull empire, the exception being the Earth-obsessed Skrulls of [[Kral IV]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 89|91}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 93}} Roaming the cosmos are several Skrull slaver ships.{{r|Skrulls! Vol 1 1}}

Though the Skrulls are an expansionist martial race, most Skrulls live peaceful lives.{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask Vol 1 6}} Like mankind, the Skrulls have ambition, and feel love and hate.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 37}} When the human telepath [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Xavier]] scanned the Skrulls of the throneworld he learned that they had enormous love for their families, were good people, had strong religious convictions, and were noble.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 90}}{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask Vol 1 6}} Skrull families consist of a father and mother, with similar dynamics to human families, including parents whom comfort their children and are willing to sacrifice their lives to save their children.{{r|Meet the Skrulls Vol 1 1|4}}{{r|Annihilation: Super-Skrull Vol 1|2}}{{r|She-Hulk Vol 2 33}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 257}} A species whom enjoy art that have nothing to do with imperialism or war, such as the songs of "Leviathan Behemoths" which are known for exquisitely intricate social calls and mournful mating calls that even the Skrullian warriors enjoy.{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1 4}} 

Skrulls are in their own way, a noble warrior race.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 24}} In their wars of conquest, they offer the inhabitants of the planet they are invading or occupying the opportunity to surrender. Those who surrender are offered a place in the empire.{{r|Secret Invasion Vol 1 1|8}}{{r|Secret Invasion: X-Men Vol 1 1}}{{r|Captain Britain and MI-13 Vol 1 4}} One example being the [[Yirbek]] who controlled a small interstellar empire before they were conquered by the Skrulls and now serve them as mercenaries in interstellar conflicts of minor significance.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 1 12}}

===Culture===
{{Main|Skrull Empire/Culture}}

==Science==
Skrull scientists were the first to create a Cosmic Cube in the universe, thousands of years ago though it ended disastrously for the Skrull Empire when it became sentient. As it destroyed two-thirds of the inhabited worlds in the Andromeda galaxy, plunging the Skrull Empire into barbarism.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 12}}{{r|Captain America Annual Vol 1 7}} Recently, due to the actions of the Skrull Priests of the Sciences led by the Head Priest of the Sciences ([[Dro'ge Fenu Edu (Earth-616)|Dro'ge Fenu Edu]]), everything that [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]] knew when he and his colleagues in the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] were captured, the Skrulls now know. They downloaded all the knowledge from their brains and their genes, resulting that the Skrulls have the same knowledge that the heroes had at that time (early to mid 1970s), including;{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 40}} 

* '''Time Travel'''
* '''Extra-Dimensional Travel'''
* '''Magic'''

The Skrulls also possess technology that suppresses [[Magic]]. With this technology they can also manipulate magical items, including merging talismans and creating new magical weapons.{{r|Captain Britain and MI-13 Vol 1 2}} The Skrulls have developed the technology to harness the [[Power Cosmic]] and transfer part of it to a Skrull.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 25}} Inter-dimensional travel is an ability they posses, being able to create portals large enough for armies to go through.{{r|Captain Britain and MI-13 Vol 1 2}}

===Technology===
The Skrull Empire possesses various technologies, including:
{{Navigation
