During WWII, American soldiers led by [[Codename: Bravo (Richard) (Earth-616)|Codename: Bravo]], and a selection of Hydra agents, were trapped in the [[Nowhere|Land of Nowhere]] when its controller, [[Jimmy Jankovicz (Earth-616)|Jimmy Jupiter]], was put in a comatose state.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 2}} There were presumably only men trapped there, but the woman who emerged from Nowhere claimed she found out who she was while within.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 4}}

Once the two sides came to a d√©tente, decades passed for the ageless residents where they worked wonders and achieved unimaginable heights for those trapped in mundane reality.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 4|6}}

Jimmy woke up decades later and the residents were ejected. Given S.H.I.E.L.D.'s recent collapse, this information didn't reach the authorities in due time.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 1}} The Queen and her people spent almost half a year gathering resources before making their move.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 2}}

When [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]], and [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] went to see Jimmy, The Queen's Hydra cell was able to track and abduct the now-catatonic Jimmy.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 1}} The Queen and Jimmy relocated to an undisclosed location in a factory building they'd seized from A.I.M.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 2}} The Queen started reaching out to the Hydra that was present in the 'real'. To gain time, she used a reactivated [[Ameridroid]] that pulled Rogers into Nowhere where they attempted to break his spirit.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 3|5}}

The Queen and her branch of Hydra planned for Jimmy to bring Nowhere into reality, anchored to the internet, to spread it around the world and let everyone have their own reality.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 4}} When [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Agent 13]], [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]], and [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] arrived at the data hub in an attempt to rescue Captain America, the Queen threatened to shoot Jimmy and trap Rogers in Nowhere forever. She was not bluffing, but Rogers was freed by Jimmy's last act of will before passing away.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 5}} Her husband was also captured but she wasn't worried for him.

Allied with [[Helmut Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]], she committed her Hydra to building a new future, knowing they would succeed because Hydra was "Right" and everyone who opposed them was "Wrong".{{r|Captain America Vol 6 5}} The Queen quickly gained many adherents, drawing resources and manpower away from people like [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Madame Viper]] and the [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]].{{r|Captain America Vol 6 6}}

The next stage of their plan called for the abduction and brainwashing of [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Gyrich]] to serve as the handler to the similarly affected [[Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616)|Dennis Dunphy]] (the former D-Man), who was made to be the new [[Scourge]], in order to kill super-criminals and "fix the system."{{r|Captain America Vol 6 11|14}} This provided a distraction for their larger plans.

She had Reed Braxton murdered and replaced by [[Life-Model Decoy|LMD]]s.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 14}} This, coupled with the previous uses of [[Madbomb (Item)|Madbomb tech]] for mental influencing and the Discordians, technologically enhanced operatives who died quickly after they were deployed. She almost brought America to its knees.

An assault on the floating island of Hydra brought an end to her campaign. Confronted by Rogers, who verbally lambasted the supposedly patriotic plan spearheaded by her husband to wake up the nation. She drew her gun and opened fire on him. The shots ricocheted off of Cap's shield, killing Richard. She was knocked into a bank of monitors where she was electrocuted. The Queen was held at an undisclosed location seemingly in a coma. A doctor attending her kneeled before the Queen, saying that he would do as she said, as long as she woke up.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 17|18}}

| Powers                  = Apparently, Hydra Queen possesses no super-human abilities.
| Abilities               = * '''Leadership:''' Her greatest strength is her ability to make deals, both in and out of Hydra. She has a great charisma and easily makes people follow her,{{r|Captain America Vol 6 3}}{{r|Captain America Vol 6 5}} helped by a firm grasp of people's psychology.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 15}} She also cares for the simple Hydra scientists and soldiers, and doesn't want to leave people behind.{{r|Captain America Vol 6 2}}
