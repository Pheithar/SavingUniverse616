===Origin===
Walther Theodoric was the costumed thief known as Baron Brimstone. He used technology to make people believe he had magical powers.{{r|Machine Man #16}}

===Satan Squad===
Theodoric teamed up with [[Willard Harrison (Earth-616)|Hammer Harrison]] and [[Sylvester Marston (Earth-616)|Snake Marston]] to form the [[Satan Squad (Earth-616)|Satan Squad]] in a series of crimes that would enable him to mass-produce the Sol-Mac weapon. When Satan Squad member Duke Dawson tried to rat out Brimstone to [[Pamela Quinn (Earth-616)|Pamela Quinn]] of [[Delmar Insurance Company (Earth-616)|Delmar Insurance Company]], Snake and Hammer confronted them, and Snake wrapped his body around Dawson, crushing him to death. They turned Pamela over to Baron Brimstone. Later, Hammer and Snake led the Satan Squad in an attempt to steal the golden bell of the cathedral St. Gabriela of the Highlands, only to be confronted by [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]]. Snake tried to wrap himself around the robot, but Machine Man spun himself at a terrific speed, hurtling Snake into the Satan Squad. Machine Man went on to defeat Baron Brimstone.{{r|Machine Man #16}}

===Spider-Man===
He was imprisoned on [[Ryker's Island]] in the Maximum Security unit. However this was not for long as he hypnotized a guard into freeing him and then freed the [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]], hoping to use him to get revenge on Machine Man. The two attack Delmar Insurance, hoping to use Pamela as bait to trap Machine Man. The pair managed to kidnap her, despite interference by both [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and Machine Man, although Spider-Man managed to place a [[Spider-Tracer]] on Quinn unobserved. Tracking Brimstone and the Sandman down to Brimstone's estate in Westchester County, Spider-Man and Machine Man engaged the villains in battle. Brimstone led the web-slinger into the Quasi-Universe, an alien realm existing in interdimensional space, but the two were shunted back to Earth once Spider-Man damaged the harness beneath Brimstone's cloak. The heroes defeated the Sandman while Baron Brimstone took advantage of the distraction to repair his harness and escape, abandoning his ally.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #99}}

===Avengers===
After pulling a heist on a yacht in the French Riviera, Theodoric tried a similar crime in the Caribbean, but he was defeated by the super-heroes [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] and [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]].{{r|Avengers #251}}

===Fantastic Four===
Brimstone and a group of villains were compelled by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]'s Aggression Enhancer machine to attack the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] as they testified before a hearing of the House Subcommittee on Superhuman Activities . All were quickly defeated and taken into police custody.{{r|Fantastic Four #335|6}}

===Heroes for Hire===
Brimstone later became involved in a "cursed arms" racket in [[Miami]], [[Florida (State)|Florida]], where he battled the [[Heroes for Hire (Knight & Wing) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]]. He was defeated when [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]], momentarily entranced by the bedevilled weaponry, tricked him into holding one of the guns which she had secretly emptied. Brimstone was then dragged through a portal to [[Hell]], to answer to the demon responsible for the [[Demonica (Weapons)|Demonica]].{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 3 #2}}
