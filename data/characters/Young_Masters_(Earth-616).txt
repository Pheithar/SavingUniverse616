===Origin===
Originally assembled by [[Lisa Molinari (Earth-616)|Coat of Arms]] as an examination of superheroism art project.{{r|Dark Reign: Young Avengers Vol 1 3}} The group was largely motivated by [[Christopher Colchiss (Earth-616)|Melter]]'s desire to be real heroes, but hindered significantly by unclear and conflicting ideals including [[Daniel DuBois (Earth-616)|Executioner]]'s [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]]-style ruthlessness, [[Amity Hunter (Earth-616)|Big Zero]]'s racism and violent tendencies, [[Egghead (Robot) (Earth-616)|Egghead]]'s psychopathy and hedonism, and Coat of Arm's distorted view of ethics. Only Melter and [[Sylvie Lushton (Earth-616)|Enchantress]] showed much interest in actual altruistic heroism.

===[[Dark Reign]]===
The team began calling themselves the "[[Young Avengers]]", but were only active as superheroes a short time before being confronted by the real [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]].{{r|Dark Reign: Young Avengers Vol 1 1}} The original Young Avengers offered the possibility of recruitment after individually vetting each member.{{r|Dark Reign: Young Avengers Vol 1 2|3}} The Young Avengers gave mixed reviews; membership was only offered to Coat of Arms and Enchantress, leaving the rest of the team under Melter's leadership but still under the supervision of the Young Avengers. However, [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] learned about Enchantress' origins and links to  [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]], and she was expelled from the [[Avengers Mansion|Young Avengers Headquarters]] shortly after arriving.{{r|Dark Reign: Young Avengers Vol 1 4}} 

Unhappy with the Young Avengers' decision, the team decided to take on the mantle and expectations of the '''Young Master''', and Melter contacted [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] to gain his support and the backing of [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|his Avengers]].{{r|Dark Reign: Young Avengers Vol 1 4}} When the Young Avengers returned to the [[Invisible Manor]], they were unexpectedly confronted by the Dark Avengers. Some members of the Young Masters began showing doubts about their stance and began aiding the Young Avengers. The battle ended when the combined magic of Coat of Arms, Enchantress, and Wiccan was used to banish [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]]. The Young Masters then disappeared after Enchantress teleported them out.{{r|Dark Reign: Young Avengers Vol 1 5}} 

The Young Masters continued to lay low after the [[Siege (Event)|Siege]] of [[Asgard]] and the fall of Norman Osborn. The team was also compromised when Enchantress became weak and ill after the death of Loki.{{r|Age of Heroes Vol 1 2}}

Melter eventually departed for unknown reasons. Coat of Arms, Big Zero and Enchantress were eventually recruited to [[Briggs Chemical LLC (Earth-616)|Briggs Chemical LLC]].{{r|Avengers Academy Vol 1 34}}

===Vengeance===
Following the departure of several members, Egghead and Executioner received a mysterious new benefactor and carried out a recruitment drive for new members, bringing in [[Mako (Young Masters) (Earth-616)|Mako]], [[Black Knight (Young Masters) (Earth-616)|Black Knight]], and [[Radioactive Kid (Earth-616)|Radioactive Kid]].{{r|Vengeance Vol 1 1}} 

Taking a new headquarters at an abandoned [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] base in [[Pennsylvania (State)|Pennsylvania]] purchased from [[Devlin DeAngelo (Earth-616)|Devlin DeAngelo]], the team decided to hunt down and verify the death of [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]]. Finding his corpse, the group was attacked and defeated by [[Maki Matsumoto (Earth-616)|Lady Bullseye]].{{r|Vengeance Vol 1 2}}

They then attempted to murder [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]], but were stopped by the [[Teen Brigade (Earth-616)|Teen Brigade]]. In the aftermath, the Black Knight deserted. She ended up sleeping with [[Ultimate Nullifier (Teen Brigade) (Earth-616)|Ultimate Nullifier]], and gave him a [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] file leaked to the group by their benefactor.{{r|Vengeance Vol 1 4}}

After attempting, and failing, to recruit the reborn [[Kid Loki (Earth-616)|Kid Loki]],{{r|Vengeance Vol 1 5}} the Masters planned a final assassination: [[Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)|Kristoff Vernard]] the regent of [[Latveria]].{{r|Vengeance Vol 1 6}}

===Bagalia===
The Young Masters then acted under the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] in [[Bagalia]] and are supervised by [[Frank Payne (Earth-616)|Constrictor]].{{citation}}<!-- isn't it rather all young villains who joined the masters? -->{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 4}} Most younger villains seem to have been recruited along with all former members.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 2}} Occasionally they are dispensed to perform some of the Masters of Evil's dirty work, but they primarily relax and play inside their base, [[Constrictor's Snakepit|the Snakepit]], in Bagalia.{{r|Avengers Undercover Vol 1 4}}
