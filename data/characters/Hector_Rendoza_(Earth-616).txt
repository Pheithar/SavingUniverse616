| body   = '''Invisibility Field''': Hector Rendoza's power was to generate a field of invisibility. Unfortunately, when it manifested, the field turned Hector's skin transparent, leaving his muscles, organs and bones showing through. Jean theorized that had his powers been allowed to evolve, he would have been able to render himself and others completely invisible.

*'''''Transference''''': Hector could transfer this field via touch, returning him to normal while disrupting his opponent.
