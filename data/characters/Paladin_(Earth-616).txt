===Mercenary===
Paladin was a mercenary and private investigator. He sought [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] while engaged in an assignment to track down the [[Zebediah Killgrave (Earth-616)|Purple Man]], and battled Daredevil.{{r|Daredevil #150}} He clashed with Daredevil a second time after the crime fighter inadvertently interfered with Paladin's search for the Purple Man. Paladin allied with Daredevil in battle against the Cobra, the Jester, and [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mister Hyde]], who were under the control of the Purple Man.{{r|Daredevil #154}}

Paladin next battled the [[Dennis Sutton (Earth-616)|Phantasm]]. Paladin aided the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] against [[Walther Theodoric (Earth-616)|Baron Brimstone]], acquired a modified uniform, and began a romance with the Wasp. Paladin aided the Avengers in battle against the Masters of Evil IV.{{r|Avengers #271}} Paladin also allied with [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] and the Wasp against mobsters.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #105}}

Paladin was later employed by [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]] to investigate a conspiracy which threatened her native country of [[Symkaria]], and he allied with Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #321}} Paladin was then hired by [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]] to raid Serpent Society headquarters. He was captured, but freed by Captain America. Paladin accompanied Captain America in his search for Diamondback, the Asp, and Black Mamba. With his new allies, Paladin battled Superia's horde of female superhumans.{{r|Captain America #392}}

An unabashed womanizer, Paladin would often flirt with any woman who caught his eye. He briefly dated the Wasp at a time when she was separated from [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]], much to the [[Dane Whitman (Earth-616)|Black Knight]]'s jealousy, who was also attracted to her. For a time, he enlisted [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]] into helping him retrieve a sword for [[Adrienne Frost (Earth-616)|Adrienne Frost]], the sister of [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]]. During this period, the mutant known as [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]] was strongly attracted to Paladin, but that affection disappeared when Generation X and Paladin later went their separate ways. He has also been a longtime ally to Silver Sable and her Wild Pack organization, working for pay, of course. He once helped them protect a scientist from a kidnapping attempt by the Heroes for Hire, a group he would later join. His main opponent was Misty Knight, who seemed to be an equal match.{{r|Heroes for Hire #11}}

Paladin has a certain amount of honor. For example, he was once hired by a corrupt government to assist rebels as part of a sting operation. He aided the rebels in a bomb-laying operation at a government facility. When the rebels were caught, his government handler remarked how lucky they were that the bomb had not gone off. Paladin replied, "I'm sorry, that would have been extra," and activated the bomb by remote control while driving away.{{r|Amazing Fantasy Vol 2 #16}}

He was offered 10 million dollars by mobster Vincent Mangano to kill the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]]. Paladin agreed to this arrangement, but did not succeed, and in the ensuing fight both of his legs were broken by the [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|U.S. Agent]].{{r|Punisher: No Escape #1}}

Paladin once took down Daredevil with a sniper rifle from a helicopter at a great distance. He did so for the FBI, in exchange for getting his record expunged. The hit, while serious, was not fatal, though did lead to Daredevil's arrest.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 #79}}

===S.H.I.E.L.D.===
During the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]] resulting from the Superhero Registration Act, Paladin accepted an offer from [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]] to join the new [[Heroes for Hire (Knight & Wing) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]], purely for the money. However, Paladin betrayed the team on their second mission when Misty Knight took them to see the underground Captain America to try and talk him into a peaceful resolution after the death of [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Goliath]]. Seeing a bigger payday Paladin struck a trap with the intention of capturing Captain America for [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]].

However, the trap failed to capture [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]] who was able to turn the tables on Paladin. Captain America then swapped costumes with the unconscious Paladin and S.H.I.E.L.D. took him into custody believing he was the Captain.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 2 #2}} Paladin later returned to the Heroes for Hire, again working for S.H.I.E.L.D., having gotten them to procure [[Moon-Boy (Earth-78411)|Moon Boy]] from the [[Savage Land]].{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 2 8|10}} When they returned to [[New York City]] during [[World War Hulk]] after procuring Moon Boy, Paladin attempted to retrieve Moon Boy from them and also faked his death on a training operation for [[Carmilla Black (Earth-616)|Carmilla Black]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'S [[Scorpion]].{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 2 11|15}}

Sometime after parting ways with the Heroes for Hire when they disbanded, he was still contracted as a mercenary with S.H.I.E.L.D. but [[Nasim Rahimov (Earth-616)|Nasim Rahimov]], an old associate of [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]], offered him a larger sum to work for him in his attempts to seek terroristic revenge on his country of [[Kirikhstan]] after they had his wife murdered as well as torturing and imprisoning him. Rahimov had information about the microprocessors in Tony's armor from when they worked together and was able to modify Paladin's stun gun to take his armor down, despite this Tony was able to use his [[Extremis virus|Extremis]] abilities to reboot his armor and take Paladin down. Paladin was then questioned by S.H.I.E.L.D. and gave them everything he knew about Rahimov, in exchange for 6 weeks 'career counselling' and the possibility of more work with them.{{r|Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 30|32}}

===Dark Reign/Siege===
Paladin worked on [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s newly formed Thunderbolts team. Despite having few qualms about injuring and if necessary, killing, Paladin was one of the few members of the team to have something of a moral compass, finding the entire Thunderbolts program to be something of a cruel joke, a sentiment felt even greater by teammate [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]]. When Osborn captured [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] and former-Thunderbolt [[Melissa Gold (Earth-616)|Songbird]], the entire team was present to what would have been their execution, a combination of Paladin, Ant-Man and [[Ghost (Earth-616)|Ghost]] having a change of heart as well as Secret Warrior [[Alexander Aaron (Earth-616)|Phobos]] intervening saved the women's lives.{{r|Thunderbolts #136}}

Paladin and Ant Man's friendship and reluctant villainy came to an optimistic end during Osborn's siege of [[Asgard]]. The entire Thunderbolts team was deployed to infiltrate the city and obtain [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]]'s [[Gungnir (Spear)|Spear]] - a weapon famed to turn the tide of battle in favor of its holder. After defeating several Asgardians, a run in with the [[Mighty Avengers (Pym) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]] and numerous squabblings with other members of the team, the spear was finally obtained. Though [[Mister X (Earth-616)|Mister X]] attempted to keep the spear for himself it was Paladin who walked away with it in the end. When the Siege drew to a dramatic close, Osborn's Thunderbolts team had officially disbanded with several members either dead or captured. Ant-Man and Paladin were the only ones to actually escape the incident (along with Taskmaster and Constrictor), with the latter still in possession of Odin's spear.{{r|Thunderbolts #143}}

===Shadowland===
Recently Paladin surfaced in New York city during Shadowland again as a mercenary, this time hired to eliminate mobsters. When his target was found dead baring the insignia of Ninja clan [[Hand (Earth-616)|The Hand]] Paladin initially assumed the murder had been committed by vigilante [[Maximillian Coleridge (Earth-616)|Shroud]], who was also investigating the suspicious crime. After a brief confrontation, Shroud reasoned that the murder was too severe to be of Daredevil's doing and suggested the two should team up to determine the real perpetrator. Paladin only agreed on the basis that someone else having killed his quarry meant that he would not be paid and therefore wanted to get even. Both heroes sleuthing brought them to bionic-private investigator Misty Knight and international bounty hunter Silver Sable, who recognized Paladin instantly.

All four individuals were in fact investigating the same crime and resolved to work together. On a hunch of Misty's Paladin went to New York's Chinatown district in search of [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mr. Negative]], a crime lord who may have been behind the murders. This turned out to be a dead end as Negative had already been probed by Spider-Man and Shang Chi and subsequently attacked by The Hand. Eventually Misty and Silver deduced the murders were in fact the actions of several New York policemen disguised as Hand Ninja and getting revenge on criminals who had narrowly skirted conviction. The Hand themselves were furious at being impersonated and a battle erupted between all parties. Afterwards, thanks to the four heroes combined efforts, The Hand were subdued and the corrupted policemen all arrested.{{r|Shadowland: Blood on the Streets #4}}

===Villains for Hire===
Paladin served as a member of Heroes for Hire and developed feelings for Misty Knight, working alongside several heroes in various missions he discovered that the Heroes for Hire team was set up by the Purple man to eliminate rival criminals. When Purple Man set up his own Villains for Hire team, Paladin went undercover as the team's Scourge.{{r|Villains for Hire #4}}

===Doctor Doom===
After Latverian missiles wrecked the [[Antlion Control Center]] on the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]], the Government of [[Symkaria]] hired Paladin and [[Orb (Mercenary) (Earth-616)|Orb]] to hunt down [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)]].{{r|Doctor Doom Vol 1 6}}
