===The Return of Wolverine===
A contingent of the Reavers led by a recently resurfaced Donald Pierce came to the burial sight where the X-Men left the molten remains of Logan's body. Bonebreaker mockingly chided the adamantium statue while pricking his finger on it's extended claws, they ended up tripping a silent alarm put in place by the crypt holder's friends in the event someone tried to desecrate it.

A firefight would break out between the X-Men's heavy hitters and the decadent remnants of the bionic mutant killers. Pierce, having taken on the job due to the all time lows he and his crew had hit in the following years, was being paid by an unknown buyer to excavate the fallen Canadian's remains for a handsome sum of money. The decayed cyborgs needed this score desperately.

Callahan opting to take Pierce and Cylla back to base with them in order to modify their mutant hunting equipment, while ordering the extermination of the rest afterward.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 13}}

In exchange for the program data hidden within Alex himself, The Reavers found themselves briefly forced to ally with the X-Men to rescue their comrades from a shared enemy.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 15}} Allegiances which quickly turned sideways as the Reavers predictably betrayed their X ally's the second they deciphered the [[Reaver Virus|secreted code]] stored in Alex's brain.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 4 16}} The same nanobionic code they were fighting with Callahan to ascertain, a piece of technoforming program that enables any mechanical apparatus to override and assimilate any kind of mechanical or cybernetic operational system; be it biological, inorganic, purely motorized or even Artificial Intelligence.
