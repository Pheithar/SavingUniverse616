At one of their testing sites, a group of scientist intended to gauge the fear induced in a group of sentient A.I.-equipped dummies in a crash test. The procedure was interrupted by [[Quasi-Motivational Destruct Organism (Earth-616)|Quasimodo]] and [[Highly Engineered Robot Built for Interdimensional Exploration (Earth-616)|H.E.R.B.I.E.]] on behalf of the [[A.I. Army (Earth-616)|A.I. Army]]. Quasimodo stopped the car before it crashed and H.E.R.B.I.E. used an [[Un-Inhibitor]] to grant the test dummies free will. [[Arno Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] appeared on the scene and saved the scientists when Quasimodo flung the test car at their observation deck, prompting the robots to escape.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 2}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
