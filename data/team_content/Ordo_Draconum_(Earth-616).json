They stopped fighting for the crown, and began fighting for humanity.<!-- {{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}} --> Their activities in the 16th century were mostly focused on the [[Vampire Wars]].<!-- {{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}} --> In the 17th century, they opposed a [[zombies|zombie]] plague.<!-- {{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}} --> The Order almost came to an end during the 18th century, when they battled and brought down the [[Fjord Queens]].<!-- {{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}} --> The threat of the Vampires came back in the 19th century, and the Order fought against them again. During the 20th century, supernatural threats expanded due to military conflicts and cultures and mythologies mixing up. Among these threats the Order most notably battled [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi]] super-human creatures.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}}<!-- unknown if during WWII or after against Nazi remnants -->\n\n===21st Century===\nThe Ordo Draconum remained active when all militant orders were allegedly disbanded or disarmed.{{r|Daredevil Vol 5 16}} In modern days, the Order had chapter houses all over the world.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 605}} Its [[New York]] watchpost was run by [[Father Jordan (Earth-616)|Father Jordan]].<!-- {{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}} -->\n\nWhen [[Hand (Earth-616)|The Hand]] launched an attack on [[Manhattan]], Father Jordan rallied twenty soldiers of the Ordo Draconum to fight the invading evil and assist [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}} Despite carrying out a successful assault against the [[Beast (Demon) (Earth-616)|Beast]]'s temple, Daredevil and the Order ended up surrounded by a horde of ninja.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}} Most members of the Ordo Draconum were killed, forcing Daredevil, Father Jordan and other two knights to retreat into a building. As a last-ditch attempt to escape from The Hand, Daredevil and the Order charged into a [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]] stable nearby and stole horses to flee. Daredevil and the Ordo Draconum regrouped with a band of vigilantes that had been rallied by [[Franklin Nelson (Earth-616)|Foggy Nelson]] (namely [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]], [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]], and the [[Defenders (Manhattan) (Earth-616)|Defenders]] [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] and [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]]), and intercepted The Hand at [[New York City Hall|City Hall]], where the Beast attempted to attack [[Samuel Chung (Earth-616)|Blindspot]]. During that \"Battle of City Hall,\" the combined forces of the superheroes, the Order and the police managed to overpower The Hand. The Beast vanished in a flash of light after Daredevil stabbed it with a magical sword. Having lost many members, Father Jordan intended to go on a recruitment drive, starting with Blindspot.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 605}}\n| Equipment               = Suits of armor{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}}\n| Transportation          = Troop carrier plane,<!-- {{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}} --> suits of armor with flying features;<!-- {{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}} --> formerly horses{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}}\n| Weapons                 = Swords and fire-arms{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}}\n| Notes                   = * The members of the Order all take the last rites before every mission.{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 605}}\n* [[Father Jordan (Earth-616)|Father Jordan]] mentioned that a [[Van Helsing]] member of the Order died fighting a [[Yeti-Demon]] in [[Nepal]].{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 604}} It's unspecified if he referred to the most famous [[Abraham van Helsing (Earth-616)|Abraham van Helsing]] or another member of the Van Helsing family.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [[Wikipedia:Order of the Dragon|Order of the Dragon at ''Wikipedia'']].\n}}\n[[Category:Catholicism]]\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]"
