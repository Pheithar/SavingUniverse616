Hawley was later killed during another German bombing raid in [[London (England)|London]].{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 4}}\n\nOn at least two occasions, in 1944, Red Cross' blood supplies were tainted by Nazi agents.\n\n====1944====\n=====''Doctor Necrosis blood-tainting''=====\nNecrosis, a doctor loyal to the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazis]] and infected with the \"White gangrene\", learned that blood transfusions prolonged his life. He decided to use his illness to aid his country while also find a cure after learning that a rare blood type could cure him: He joined the Red Cross in [[Australia]], where the shipment of blood was sent to the South Pacific battlefields, taking the blood donated by Allies citizens to transfuse himself with and left his own tainted blood in its place to infect anyone transfused with it. He eventually learned his assistant [[Mary Knowles (Earth-616)|Mary Knowles]] had the rare blood type that could possibly cure him.\n\nHis plans was spotted by the military who sent [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky]] to investigate. Necrosis tried to cure himself and infect Mary, but Cap and Bucky eventually managed to defeat him, and he was killed during the struggle.{{r|Captain America Comics #36}}\n\n=====''Herr Schmutz blood-tainting''=====\nA similar action was perpetrated by [[Herr Schmutz (Earth-616)|Herr Schmutz]] and his minions who began tainting blood donated to the Red Cross by U.S. citizens to be used in war hospitals in [[Europe]], in setting up a secret hideout along the shipping road and planting his agents as truckers. When the shipments were inspected, the supplies of blood were driven to the hideout, and replaced with previously obtained samples poisoned. \n\nWhen American troops injured during combat in [[Italy]] were given the tainted blood as transfusions and died, the military allowed the [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and [[Thomas Raymond (Earth-616)|Toro]] to investigate state-side to investigate. Discovering the secret operation, the Torch sent Toro to get the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|FBI]] while he tried to round-up Schmutz and his men. The nazis were arrested while trying to escape to [[Germany]], using a U-Boat, and were turned over to the authorities.{{r|Human Torch #14}}\n\n====1945====\nAt the start of 1945, the mob [[Ed Turtle (Earth-616)|Mock Turlte]] and his minions organized a robbery at a local auditorium where a Red Cross charity function was taking place to raise funds for the organization's efforts assisting those in need during the [[World War II|war]]. The thieves robbed the charity and fled the scene. Chasing after them, the [[Robert Frank (Earth-616)|Whizzer]] managed to catch up with them and captured the crooks.{{r|All Select Comics #5}}\n\n[[File:Red Cross (Earth-616) Captain Britain Vol 2 10.png|thumb|right|[[James Braddock Jr. (Earth-616)|Jamie Braddock]]'s crimes]]\n----\n===Modern Era===\n====[[James Braddock Jr. (Earth-616)|Jamie Braddock]]'s attack(s)====\nAt least one of their staff was attacked by the madman [[James Braddock Jr. (Earth-616)|Jamie Braddock]] in the [[Sahara Desert]], in [[Africa]]. All members were killed by his henchman, only for a young woman who was later sold as a slave to arabic masters at [[Tangier]] in [[Algeria]].{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 10}}\n\n====[[Genosha]]====\nAfter [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] crashed a mountain of [[Genosha]] on insurgents to his rule, the Red Cross estimated that the casualties were over ten thousand dead.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #111}}\n\n====Mutant Population Climax====\nAt the peak of the [[Homo superior|mutant]] population (before the [[M-Day]]), the Red Cross (governmental agents posing as such, or working within) proceeded to mutant-screen under the guise of different health programs, blood-giving, and HIV-testing, according to [[Fagin (Earth-616)|Fagin]], a member of the terrorist [[Brotherhood (Earth-616)|Brotherhood]]. Also, people who refused to proceed with these tests or giving, such as [[Michael Asher (Earth-616)|Michael Asher]], were forced to do it by armed agents. When Michael was revealed to be a mutant, he fled, chased by both his schoolmates and the governmental agents. Eventually, masked and heavy-armed soldiers with the emblem of the Red Cross assaulted the school in the search for him, and were all killed by him, before the terrorists left, after that government felony made Asher to join them.{{r|Brotherhood #3}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * For more intel on our [[Earth-1218|universe]] Red Cross, please follow read the [[Wikipedia:International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] Wikipedia article or the [http://www.redcross.org/ American website of the organization].\n| Trivia                  = * This organization shouldn't be confused with [[Mutantes Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Earth-616)|Mutantes Sans Fronti\u00e8res]], a similar organization who have as symbol a red X, instead of a Red Cross, but who focus on [[Homo superior|mutants]].\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:International Organizations]]\n[[Category:Charities]]\n[[Category:Medical Organizations]]"
