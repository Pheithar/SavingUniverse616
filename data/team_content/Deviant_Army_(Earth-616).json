It also has at times being led by warlords and rogue generals, waging war among the Deviants in civil conflicts or used for private agendas. It possesses armored combat vehicles (usually tracked), robotic war machines (e.g. tanks), and seismic weapons that are capable of creating localized earthquakes or shattering the planetary crust. Deviant soldiers are trained not only in the use of ranged weapons (guns) but also in the use of swords and polearms.\n\n===Modern Era===\nWhen the high priest [[Ghaur (Earth-616)|Ghaur]] attempted to conquer the Earth by bringing the Elder God [[Set (Earth-616)|Set]] to the world from its dimension, the Deviant army was involved in the conflict. They fought against the various heroes (including the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] in their attempts to free their teammates, the [[Brides of Set (Earth-616)|\"Brides of Set\"]].{{r|West Coast Avengers Annual Vol 2 4}}{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 22}}\n\nIn the aftermath, the Deviants collapsed into civil strife. The strongest of the warring generals led his faction within the army to attack the other subterranean peoples in an attempt to reclaim lost Deviant technology and territory. Which soon came to involve the Avengers and the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]. The Deviant warlord was defeated and his army turned on him, killing the general.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 20}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Annual Vol 1 17}}{{r|Iron Man Annual Vol 1 12}}{{r|West Coast Avengers Annual Vol 2 6}} \n\nWhen the time traveling conqueror [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang]] broadcast to the world that anyone that conquered territory in his name would be allowed to keep what they conquered, a rogue Deviant general led an army to the surface and attacked China. They were repelled by [[People's Liberation Army (Earth-616)|Chinese army]] which was aided by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. The latter then pursued them underground and seized control of the army upon the defeat of their champion.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 42|44}} When the Deviants later learned that the Eternals had regained their memories, Kra led a Deviant army to confront them at Olympia.
