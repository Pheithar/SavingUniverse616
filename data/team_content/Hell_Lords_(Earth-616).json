From time to time groups of them meet to discuss issues concerning all of them.\n\nMany of them have claimed or played off the fear of the idea of \"Satan,\" a single absolute overlord of all evil. Some of their gatherings are even around his throne. Satan has at times been treated as a title for a hell-lord who is able to amass enough power to rule the rest. However, no single hell-lord has ever amassed such power. If there is an actual Satan, none of the hell-lords known have ever encountered him, and some doubt such an entity ever existed at all.{{r|Journey into Mystery #627}}\n\n| HistoryText             = \n===[[Pre-Cataclysmic Age]] and [[Hyborian Age]]===\n[[Aqquoonkagua (Earth-616)|Aqquoonkagua]], [[Dansker (Earth-616)|Dansker]], [[Kx'ulthuum (Earth-616)|Kx'ulthuum]], [[Xuthl (Earth-616)|Xuthl]], and others were among the Hell Lords during the [[Pre-Cataclysmic Age]] and the [[Hyborian Age]], when the netherworlds were known as [[Hell|Arallu]]. They eventually lost power overtime.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3|; [[Demons]]' entry}}\n\n[[File:Hell-Lords from X-Infernus Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left]]\n===[[Modern Age]]===\n====[[X-Infernus Vol 1|X-Infernus]]====\n[[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Darkchilde]] searched for the missing [[Bloodstones|bloodstone amulet]] and her [[Soulsword]]. She was watched by the Hell-Lords. Everyone except [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] was impressed of her. It was then shown that they were summoned by [[Ananym (Earth-616)|Witchfire]]. Witchfire revealed that she intended to call the [[Elder Gods of Limbo]] using the bloodstones. She then told them to stay away from [[Limbo (Otherplace)|Limbo]] so she could conquer it and destroy Darkchilde. Mephisto replied that if she takes back her kingdom, she will be offered a seat and may have a place in their larger goals.{{r|X-Infernus #1}}\n\n====Prelude to the Descent====\nAs the deadline for an event called the Descent, wherein one of the Hell Lords would be chosen to become the new Devil, began approaching, the Hell-Lords began choosing candidates to replace them should they be chosen. Mephisto selected [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]], [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]], and [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] as potential candidates, bestowing them with Hell Marks.{{r|Venom Vol 2 14}} [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]], himself a candidate due to being [[Marduk Kurios (Earth-616)|Marduk Kurios]]' son, later possessed Venom with a demon in order to turn the symbiote into one of his [[Monsters of Evil (Earth-616)|Monsters of Evil]] and make Flash a more legitimate candidate, but the demon was suppressed by the Hell Mark and later revealed that possessing those who bore the Hell Marks had been forbidden.{{r|Venom Vol 2 25}} The Venom symbiote, realizing that the demon was beginning to take control of Flash, expelled it and the Hell Mark into its clone, which it bonded to [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Andrea Benton]], turning her into Mania.{{r|Venom Vol 2 42}}\n\n====[[Hell on Earth War]]====\n[[File:X-Factor Vol 1 250 Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]\n[[Tier Sinclair (Earth-616)|Tier Sinclair]] became the central mover in a war between the various Hell-Lords. The first to kill him would be crowned King of Hell. After Tier was able to kill Pluto, Mephisto decided that the rules were forfeit and turned his attention to his fellows. [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] became the last line of resistance and fought the seemingly victorious Mephisto. [[Guido Carosella (Earth-616)|Strong Guy]] took the opportunity to kill Tier in the chaos, winning the War and becoming the King of Hell.{{r|X-Factor #250|255}}\n\nWhen the [[Thunderbolts (Red Hulk) (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] were accidentally stranded in Hell, they made a deal with Mephisto to get out in exchange for dethroning the \"pretender,\" who was revealed to them to be Guido.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 21}} Red Hulk fought against Guido and managed to convince Guido to abandon the position of Hell Lord and try to regain his lost soul, allowing Mephisto to regain the throne and let the Thunderbolts return to [[Earth]]. Red Hulk offered Guido the opportunity to return with them, but he preferred to stay until he could regain his soul.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 22}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]] and [[Hades (Earth-616)|Pluto]] control realms of the dead, but are considered 'Death-Gods' and not Hell-Lords. Despite this distinction, Hela is a member of the Hell Lords and Pluto has previously been a member. Similarly, [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]] is one of the [[Faltine]] and rules over the [[Dark Dimension]], but has also been a member of the Hell Lords.{{r|X-Infernus Vol 1 1}} The Hazareth Three also maintain a 'Hell'like dimension, but do not seem to be connected. \n* Many Hell Lords are [[Demons Classifications#Class Two Demons|Class Two Demons]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Horror 2005 Vol 1 1}}\n| Trivia                  = * Some of the Hell-Lords are members of [[Lords of the Splinter Realms (Earth-616)|Lords of the Splinter Realms]], another group of rulers of Hell-like dimensions.\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Class Two Demons]]\n[[Category:Interdimensional Organizations]]\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Demonic Organizations]]"
