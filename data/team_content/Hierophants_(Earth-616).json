They planned to use it to overthrow the Queen of Angels and conquer the other [[Glossary:Ten Realms|Nine Realms]].{{r|Angela: Queen of Hel Vol 1 7}} One day a Hierophant was followed to the furnace by an Anchorite named [[Sera (Earth-616)|Sera]]. He caught her looking into it and tried to make her answer the transgression with her life, but Sera cast a spell that threw him to his death inside the engine.{{r|Angela: Queen of Hel Vol 1 3}} After this incident, the furnace mysteriously vanished{{r|Angela: Queen of Hel Vol 1 7}} and Sera escaped from the [[Under-City of the Anchorites|Temple of the Anchorites]].{{r|Angela: Asgard's Assassin Vol 1 3}}\n\nA Hierophant later confronted Sera, demanding her to return to the Temple with him. When she refused to go, he offered to give her companion, [[Aldrif Odinsdottir (Earth-616)|Angela]], information about her missing mother, [[Loriel (Earth-616)|Loriel]], if she returned Sera to him. Angela didn't take his deal and proceeded to attack him, forcing the Hierophant to flee while vowing to take revenge on her for defying the Temple.{{r|Angela: Queen of Hel Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Angels (Tenth Realm)]]\n[[Category:Asgardian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Male Characters]]"
