Though, before Mentallo was able to notify the rest of the team, the robot used the powers of the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] to murder the telepath.{{r|Super-Villain Team-Up MODOK's 11 Vol 1 2}} \n\nDespite the loss of one of their team, the group continued with the plan, successfully infiltrating the beacon and stealing the Hypernova. Immediately after the acquisition of the Hypernova, however, Spot is revealed to have also been a traitor, stealing the Hypernova in order to sell it to the [[Temugin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]]. Despite his willingness to buy the Hypernova from him, the Mandarin is disgusted by Spot's dishonorable actions against his team and uses his [[Mandarin's Rings|Dark Light Ring]] to strand him in the [[Darkforce Dimension]].{{r|Super-Villain Team-Up MODOK's 11 Vol 1 3}} \n\nWithout the power of the Hypernova, the Ifinicide Beacon was destroyed in an explosion that would have killed the remaining team if the Ultra-Adaptoid hadn't secretly used the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman's]] powers to protect themselves and the rest of the team. The team set out after Mandarin in order to retrieve the Hypernova only for Rocket Racer to be revealed to also be a double-agent working for [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. In response, the Ultra-Adaptoid finally revealed their identity in order to go after Rocket Racer.{{r|Super-Villain Team-Up MODOK's 11 Vol 1 4}} \n\nThe now diminished team of Armadillo, Puma, Living Laser and Nightshade joined forces with the Mandarin in order to destroy the Ultra-Adaptoid after the robot managed to nearly kill Rocket Racer. Living Laser acquired the Hypernova but, hoping that its power would allow him to return to human form, Laser merged with the device, seemingly destroying them both.{{r|Super-Villain Team-Up MODOK's 11 Vol 1 5}} \n\nThinking that they failed, the remaining three members of the team returned to M.O.D.O.K.'s base only for M.O.D.O.K. to reveal that almost everything that had happened had been part of his plan. M.O.D.O.K. had anticipated the involvement of Rappaccini, Spot's betrayal to the Mandarin, and Living Laser's ultimate decision to try and merge with the Hypernova (thus making Rappaccini and the Mandarin honorary members of M.O.D.O.K.'s 11 whether anyone other than M.O.D.O.K. had realized it or not). M.O.D.O.K. had secretly stolen the real Hypernova from Spot during one of his teleport jumps via an access to the Darkforce Dimension before he had sold it to the Mandarin, replacing it with a duplicate that was destroyed by Living Laser. M.O.D.O.K. immediately sold the real Hypernova to Rappaccini, paying the three last loyal members of Nightshade, Armadillo, and Puma each a portion of the very large sum Rappaccini paid.{{r|Super-Villain Team-Up MODOK's 11 Vol 1 5}} \n\nIt turned out that M.O.D.O.K. had one last trick up his sleeve, however, having neglected to tell Rappaccini that the Hypernova was unstable and was likely to detonate, which it did seemingly killing Rappaccini and destroying her A.I.M. base.{{r|Super-Villain Team-Up MODOK's 11 Vol 1 5}}\n\n\n\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Rocket Racer modified or built the following vehicles for the team's use:\n* [[Big Wheel (Vehicle)|Big Wheel]]\n* A submersible Racer named Nautilus Junior\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Advanced Idea Mechanics Experiment]]"
