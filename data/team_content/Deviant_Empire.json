By 1,000,000 BC, they had expanded their empire underground and attacked the mystical oasis known as the [[Garden of Eden|Garden]] seeking [[Star Brand (Object)|the source of its power]], attempting to enslave the prehistoric human [[Vnn (Earth-616)|Vnn]] and his lover [[Brrkk (Earth-616)|Brrkk]]. While they were initially repelled, the Deviants returned in a burrowing machine, triggering a cave-in that killed Brrkk and led to Vnn becoming the second avatar of the Star Brand.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 26}}\n\nTheir navies and aircraft made of steel were used to sweep the seas clean of mankind. Approximately 20,000 years ago, the Deviants conquered nearly the whole world and all of mankind, except for the empire of [[Atlantis (Empire)|Atlantis]]. On the island-continents, towering cities were built with mammoth structures and stone idols that reached the sky. Where the Deviants ruled like kings and lived in luxury. Nearly all humans were enslaved, used as beasts of burden. \n\nTheir dominion continued for centuries and in the final years, they laid siege to the Atlantean empire with armies of human mercenaries who willingly served the Deviants. When the Celestials returned, the Deviants attacked them and in retaliation the Celestials destroyed their empire. The world was devastated in the [[Great Cataclysm]], and the surviving Deviants who had been reduced to thousands from their previous millions retreated into [[Subterranea]].{{r|Eternals #2}}{{r|Eternals #8}}{{r|Avengers Annual #20}}{{r|Eternals Vol 3 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Combat aircraft, naval warships\n| Weapons                 = Directed energy weapons (beam cannons and guns)\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Empires and Civilizations]]\n[[Category:Deviants]]\n[[Category:Lemuria]]\n[[Category:Earth]]\n[[Category:Sol]]"
