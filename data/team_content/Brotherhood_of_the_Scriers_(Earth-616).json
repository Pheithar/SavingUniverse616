The Cabal's members all dress identically with hooded robes and a ghostly costume. The intensely dedicated members behave in a quasi-religious fashion with rituals and ceremonies. Rooted in Europe, the \"Scriers\" hold ties to organized crime in Europe and share a common goal of maximizing the accumulation of wealth and power through whatever means necessary.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvel.com/universe/Cabal_of_Scrier\n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Brotherhood of the Scriers]]"
