They were humanly very muscular and very skilled with their motorcycles. They were originally lead by [[Craig Simpson (Earth-616)|Curly Samuels]], who was working for [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Satan]] and ordered to capture [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Johnny Blaze]]. Satan's Servants were lead to the Ghost Rider to cause him trouble, but were intimidated by his powers. They tried a second attempt by trying to capture his love interest [[Roxanne Simpson (Earth-616)|Roxanne Simpson]] first at the [[Madison Square Garden]] motorcycle show, but were defeated once again when the Ghost Rider appeared and were taken by the police.{{r|Marvel Spotlight Vol 1 #6}}<br/>\nAfter Roxanne's disappearance, the Satan's Servants were confronted by the Ghost Rider, who bursted into their hideout, and they told him that Curly used to hang out at some sinister church in [[Bleecker Street]].{{r|Marvel Spotlight Vol 1 #7}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Knifes, chains, and pipes.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
