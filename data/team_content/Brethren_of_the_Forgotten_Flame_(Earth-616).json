When the time came, Talionis directed the rest of the Brethren of the Forgotten Flame in a self-sacrificial ritual that resulted in their blood turning into a black shell that enveloped the entirety of the planet.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 14}} After days of incubation, a Dormammu-possessed Ego hatched from the egg.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 15}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
