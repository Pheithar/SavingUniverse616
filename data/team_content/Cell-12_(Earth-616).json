They were informed that Peter Parker was more powerful than what he seemed. One evening, Cell-12 ambushed Peter and [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson-Parker]]. They roughly hit Peter Parker and severely injured him, warning him to not continue his investigations. However they didn't hurt Mary Jane.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 411}}\n\nCell-12 set a trap for [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] at the Multivex Corporation, and the bait was a large case with [[Seward Trainer (Earth-616)|Seward Trainer]]'s equipment. When Spider-Man arrived they attacked him, but they were not a big threat for him. Spider-Man damaged and knocked them out in a short time. They managed to flee thanks to [[Jason Macendale Jr. (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]], who injured and defeated Spider-Man.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 68}}\n\nCell-12 was guarding Trainer's lab at Multivex when they saw Peter Parker lurking around. They captured him and were going to kill him when Spider-Man stopped them. Spider-Man and Peter Parker, fought Cell-12. They easily knocked out [[Andros (Earth-616)|Andros]], [[Bramer (Earth-616)|Bramer]], and [[Nardi (Earth-616)|Nardi]], while [[Lasher (Cell-12)|Lasher]] eliminated himself. However Hobgoblin distracted the two spider-men again, and the cyborgs managed to run away before the arrival of the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|police]].{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 234}}\n\nVery wounded, Cell-12 recovered in an abandoned factory. They asked Hobgoblin for the payment for their mission, but Hobgoblin refused, claiming he already paid for their cures. Before flying away, he hurled a [[Pumpkin Bomb]] that exploded and destroyed the factory.{{r|Spider-Man Vol 1 69}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/cell12.htm\n}}"
