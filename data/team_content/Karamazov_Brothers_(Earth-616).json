They once bought the legs and body of the android [[Elsie-Dee (Earth-616)|Elsie-Dee]] from [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]] for cheap. They put a Japanese schoolgirl uniform on the body and planned to have it serve drinks to customers at [[Club Azimut]], an establishment run by their organization.<!-- {{r|2020 iWolverine Vol 1 1}} -->\n\nElsie-Dee and her partner [[Albert (Earth-616)|Albert]] later broke into Club Azimut to retrieve Elsie-Dee's legs and body. After Albert dispatched the gang members at the club, including the Karamazov Brothers, he put Elsie-Dee back together. Before Elsie-Dee left with Albert, she broke Ignat's nose for what he did to her body. The Brothers and other members of the Vladivostok Mafia later organized to get revenge on Albert and Elsie-Dee.{{r|2020 iWolverine Vol 1 1}}\n\nDuring the confrontation with the androids, the brothers used a RPG. After hitting Albert with a projectile, they fired another, which was grabbed by Elsie-Dee and thrown back at the brothers. The projectile detonated, killing both brothers.{{r|2020 iWolverine Vol 1 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Motorcycles\n| Weapons                 = Guns, RPG\n\n| Notes                   = * The brothers' surname likely comes from the novel ''[[Wikipedia:The Brothers Karamazov|The Brothers Karamazov]]'' by [[Wikipedia:Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Vladivostok Mafia (Earth-616)/Members]]"
