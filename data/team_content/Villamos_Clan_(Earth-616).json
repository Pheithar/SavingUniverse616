It was one of the five families that dominated the country of Puerto Dulce, who exploited the people and kept hundreds of thousands of them in abject poverty. The family were tight with the ruling military junta, and had been involved in the sugar and tobacco industries for centuries. \n\nIn the late 20th century, the clan expanded their business to the drug trade and were also involved in gunrunning. The [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] went to Puerto Dulce to shut down their operation, disguised as [[Javier Callador (Earth-616)|Javier Callador]] who he had killed. When he arrived at the [[Villamos Villa]], he discovered that Javier's girlfriend who he let live was there. She was actually one of the Villamos siblings, so they knew who he was and beat him down, after which they sent him to a prison camp (sugar cane plantation).\n\nWhile the Punisher was slowly being worked to death at the prison camp, the revolutionaries were rapidly gaining ground in Puerto Dulce. As the guerillas were advancing into the capital, the Villamos siblings attempted to flee their their country but a mortar attack took out their jet. Afterwards they headed to the harbor but the revolutionaries blew up the yacht. They then fled to the last airstrip that wasn't under the control of the revolutionaries. Only to see the Punisher (who had escaped the prison camp with the help of [[David Lieberman (Earth-616)|Microchip]] and [[Michael Phillips (Earth-616)|Ice Phillips]]) leaving in the plane they had seized. Rather than face the revolutionaries' justice, the siblings killed each other.{{r|Punisher: War Zone Vol 1 26|30}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = private business jet, private yacht\n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Crime Families]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Cartels]]"
