They were also involved in other criminal activities, including; the protection rackets, illegal gambling and prostitution.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 663|664}}{{r|Dark Reign: Mister Negative Vol 1 1}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 6|8}}\n\nIt was established out of Asian immigrants who were once slave laborers for the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]]. After being freed, they were trained by [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mister Negative]] in the martial arts for legitimate work as security guards. In reality he corrupted them into becoming his enforcers and drug dealers. [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] first confronted them while Mr. Negative was extracting [[Bruno Karnelli (Earth-616)|Bruno Karnelli]]'s blood.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #547|548}} They have successfully gone to war with the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] twice, emerging victorious both times.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #547|548}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 618|620}} In the first war, they wiped out nearly all of the Maggia leadership in NY City by use of the [[Dragon-Breath (Earth-616)|Dragon-Breath]] poison. The Inner Demons were later defeated by Spidey in [[Battery Park]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #547|548}}\n\nA while later, the Inner Demons were attacked by the [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Extra! Vol 1 #2}} During the [[Dark Reign]], the Inner Demons found themselves on the defensive as Chinatown was placed under siege by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Osborn]]'s [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] and their territory was under assault by [[Hood's Gang (Earth-616)|Hood's Gang]]. Which ended when Osborn called it all off due to the blackmail material that Mr. Negative possessed.{{r|Dark Reign: Mister Negative Vol 1 1|3}} The Inner Demons continued making inroads into Maggia territories and markets, due to the Maggia being under the leadership of the inept Bruno Karnelli. In the next war between the Inner Demons and the Maggia, that was orchestrated by [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]], they emerged victorious by default as the Maggia forces were killed by Mysterio's bomb while the Inner Demons survived.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 618|620}}\n\nRecently when Mister Negative had been arrested and deported to [[China]], the Inner Demons freed him in route and relocated to [[Shanghai]] in China. Where they established themselves and have become a major player in the underworld, perhaps the dominant player, using the drug trade to establish their power.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 6|8}}\n\n==Powers==\nThe Inner Demons are gifted with a regenerative factor, which has allowed them to regenerate lost limbs and survive being stabbed or shot multiple times.
