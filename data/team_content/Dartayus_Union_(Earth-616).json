He amassed an army over the years by preaching about the deity [[Scythian Algurus (Earth-616)|Scythian]], as a means to attract followers for himself. When the Dartayus Union became powerful enough to challenge the government, Kologoth was exiled to [[Earth]]. Kologoth's banishment rallied his people, who fought harder and longer, allowing them to turn the tide of the civil war in their favor and reach a stalemate.{{r|X-Men: Gold Vol 2 12}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * The way the emblem of the Dartayus Union is displayed as well as the uniforms worn by its members are quite reminiscent of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Party]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Negative Zoner]]\n[[Category:Political Parties]]"
