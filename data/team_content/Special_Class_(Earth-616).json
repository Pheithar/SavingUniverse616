They went into the woods to meditate, when [[U-Men (Earth-616)|U-Men]] attacked (soon after Xorn found out one of his own students had put a paper on his back with the word \"Jackass\" on it). Dummy died when [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Kid Omega]] tried to take over the school. Shortly after the mutant [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]] joined, they became members of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. Basilisk was killed by Xorn soon after. The rest of the group later rebelled. After Xorn (apparently) died, the remaining students (possibly with the approval of the teachers) disbanded the class.\n\n===[[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]'s===\nAfter [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] [[Death of Wolverine|died]], [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Ororo]] found papers about inviting [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] to teach to a new special class composed of the past students Ernst and No-Girl, but also [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]], [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]], [[Iara Dos Santos (Earth-616)|Shark-Girl]], [[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob Herman]] and [[Trevor Hawkins (Earth-616)|Eye Boy]], all considered to be \"most likely to turn super villain\" kids, but in fact as a way to find a mole working against the school. Meanwhile, Spider-Man and the Special Class have a lesson in the Danger Room, but Rockslide pushes him into a robot, which tries to crush him. Spider-Man then criticizes Rockslide for his actions and takes the special class to a museum. Suddenly, Stegron and Sauron appear in the museum and later defeats them. The Special Class later wake up in Staten Island, which had been transformed into the New Savage Land.{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men #1}} Shark Girl seemingly betrays the class, but later reveals she is still on their side, helping them defeat Stegron and Sauron. Later, the Special Class are kidnapped by Chameleon who is working for Mojo in Mojoverse. The Special Class escape with the help of the X-Babies. The Special Class were also challenged to a \"Science Off\" by Beast and his class. \n\n==Line-Up==\n===First===\n* [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]] - appointed teacher of the Special Class \n* [[Angel Salvadore (Earth-616)|Angel Salvadore]] - an insect-like mutant\n* [[Barnell Bohusk (Earth-616)|Beak]] - an avian-like mutant\n* [[Mike Columbus (Earth-616)|Basilisk]] - a mutant with limited intelligence and an unusual appearance, e.g. bald, abnormally large, and with one eye. This made him extremely aggressive. Basilisk suffered from brain seizures until he was given a device to help regulate the ability\n* [[Martha Johansson (Earth-616)|No-Girl]] - a disembodied mutant with telepathic powers \n* [[Ernst (Earth-616)|Ernst]] - super-strong mutant, who helped Martha Johansson move around the institute. \n* [[Dean Boswell (Earth-616)|Dummy]] - an autistic, young mutant whose body was made up of sentient gas. His form was put into a latex suit that granted him a humanoid appearance and functionality.\n\n===Second===\n* [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] - appointed teacher of the Special Class\n* [[Ernst (Earth-616)|Ernst]]\n* [[Martha Johansson (Earth-616)|No-Girl (Martha Johansson)]]\n* [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion (Julian Keller)]]\n* [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide (Santo Vaccarro)]]\n* [[Iara Dos Santos (Earth-616)|Shark-Girl (Iara Dos Santos)]]\n* [[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob Herman (Robert Herman)]]\n* [[Trevor Hawkins (Earth-616)|Eye Boy (Trevor Hawkins)]]\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Similarly, [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] (as headmaster of the Jean Grey School) took a class of problematic and new students on a trip to the [[Savage Land]] to deal with individual situations and teach them values he believed they lacked.
