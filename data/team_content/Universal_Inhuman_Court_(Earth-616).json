They traveled to the Earth's Moon where Earth's [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] lived, and the Court's members became the brides of the Inhuman king [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 577}}{{r|FF Vol 1 6|7}}\n\nWhen [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] invaded Earth, resulting in Black Bolt in destroying the Inhuman city of [[Attilan]],{{r|Infinity Vol 1 3}} the Universal Inhuman Court and their subjects chose to leave Earth and find a new place to live. They eventually established the city of [[Novahala]] as their new home on the continent of Akuunos on the planet Centauri-IV. Akuunos became their last resort because none of the species that compose the Universal Inhumans were accepted back in their respective homeworlds.{{r|Royals Vol 1 6}}\n\nWhen the [[Kree Imperium]] began ordering all surviving Inhumans to join it or perish, the Universal Inhumans arranged a secret meeting on an unnamed planet to discuss the situation. Before the [[House of Agon (Earth-616)|Inhuman Royal Family]] arrived, the Inhuman Court were considering surrendering to the Kree. However, the Kree arrived, including the Kree's new Inhuman soldier, [[Vox (Super-Inhumans) (Earth-616)|Vox]]. Vox killed the Court and their attendants to send a message to Black Bolt that he wasn't safe.{{r|Death of Inhumans Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
