Unfortunately, everything went horribly wrong due to their being tainted by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s neurotoxin resulting in their unexpected self-replication,{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 4 #4|5}} forcing Bruno and [[Michaela Gutierrez Miller (Earth-616)|Mike Miller]] to subsequently create [[Bruno's Dinosaur Golem (Earth-616)|a gigantic dinosaur golem]] to combat them.\n\nAs the Kamala golems and dinosaur golem rampaged through [[Jersey City]], the [[Jersey City Police Department (Earth-616)|JCPD]] were overwhelmed, prompting Bruno and Mike to summon [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki Laufeyson]] as a last resort. The God of Mischief then led his [[Loki's Guardian Golems (Earth-616)|Guardian Golems]] into battle, engaging the other golems on [[Sussex Street]].\n\nWith the situation clearly out of hand, Ms. Marvel activated her [[Locator Pendant]], summoning [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] to the scene. [[Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] targeted all non-carbon based lifeforms on Sussex Street from the [[Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station|A.F.S.S.]] and neutralized the threat with extreme prejudice.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 4 6}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Lightning Golems]]"
