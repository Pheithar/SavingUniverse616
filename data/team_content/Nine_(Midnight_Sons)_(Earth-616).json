[[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] was responsible for gathering the Nine together to do what he could not, for if he battled Lilith directly, their magical forces would further weaken the dimensional barriers between Earth and the Shadow Side. Strange sent [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Johnny Blaze]] on a mission to locate the Nine and build them as allies.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 28}} They made contact with [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]],{{r|Morbius: The Living Vampire #1}} and [[Victoria Montesi (Earth-616)|Victoria Montesi]] and her comrades [[Louise Hastings (Earth-616)|Louise Hastings]] and [[Samson Buchanan (Earth-616)|Sam Buchanan]] who opposed the return of the [[Darkhold]].{{r|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins #1}} Strange also engineered the re-assembly of his old partners [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]], [[Frank Drake (Earth-616)|Frank Drake]], and [[Hannibal King (Earth-616)|Hannibal King]] as the Nightstalkers, although their zealous anti-occult stance made them a potential danger to the rest of the Nine and Strange himself.{{r|Nightstalkers #1}}\n\nThe Nine were assembled in the land of the Midnight Sun to confront Lilith and her existing Lilin before they could release all of her children from the Shadowside. The Nine appeared successful at first, with many of the Lilin killed and Lilith herself greatly weakened before disappearing.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 31}}\n\nThe Nine were only loosely associated after that, having both cordial and antagonistic encounters with each other, especially with the Nightstalkers. They were reunited when Lilith made a pact with [[Zarathos (Earth-616)|Zarathos]] and opened the Shadowside, unleashing her lost children. The Nine were betrayed from within as Morbius was infected with Lilin blood and killed Louise. The Lilin were banished back to Shadowside, but Zarathos remained a threat with his followers, the Fallen. Ghost Rider died in battle with Zarathos, while Victoria's unholy pregnancy with [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]] forced Doctor Strange to place her in stasis. After Zarathos and the Fallen were finally defeated, the remaining members of the Nine and their allies reorganized into the [[Midnight Sons (Earth-616)|Midnight Sons]], a modern incarnation of the ancient order of the same name.<ref>[[Siege of Darkness]] crossover.</ref>\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]"
