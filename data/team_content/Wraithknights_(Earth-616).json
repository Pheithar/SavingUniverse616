They appeared to have roughly equivalent abilities, technology, and weaponry. The Wraithknights were led by a Supreme Wraithknight who was larger and more powerful than the rest.\n\nThis Supreme Wraithknight was slain in single combat by the Spaceknight [[Val (Earth-616)|Val (Sentry)]].{{r|Spaceknights Vol 1 1|5}}\n\n| Equipment               = Armor of unknown metals.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = The Supreme Wraithknight had the ability to summon and control a [[Deathwing]].\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Galadorians]]\n[[Category:Armor Users]]\n[[Category:Dire Wraiths Servants]]"
