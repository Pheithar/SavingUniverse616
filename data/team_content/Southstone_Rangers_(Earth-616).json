They were locked in a war against the other big gang, the [[Spanish Kings (Earth-616)|Spanish Kings]]. In an attempt to defuse the situation, [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] approached the Rangers' leader, [[Dray (Gangster) (Earth-616)|Dray]], to convince him to work out a truce with their enemies. Despite Dray's reluctance to listen to Falcon's words, his men convinced him to give it a chance. However, the day when both gangs gathered to call truce, Dray instead shot the Spanish King's leader, [[Character Index/O#Ortiz|Ortiz]] point blank in the head in front of Falcon, and chaos ensued.{{r|Falcon Vol 2 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = The Southstone Rangers are a stand-in for the infamous black super-gang of Chicago, the Blackstone Rangers (formerly the El Rukns).\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Gangs]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
