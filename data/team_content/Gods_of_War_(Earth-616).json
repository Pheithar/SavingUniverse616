The team included [[Sigurd (Bor) (Earth-616)|Sigurd]], [[Lorelei (Earth-616)|Lorelei]], [[Theseus (Earth-616)|Theseus]], [[Beowulf (Earth-616)|Beowulf]] and his already allies [[Ire (Earth-616)|Ire]], [[Gilgamesh (Earth-616)|Gilgamesh]] and [[Tiresias (Earth-616)|Tiresias]]. But before the meeting could end the Uprising Storm attacked. Beowulf battled [[Catastrophobia (Earth-616)|Catastrophobia]] but was no match for the new god. Theseus gloated after shooting Catastrophobia with a rifle believing he saved Wulfie's life, but the new god just stood back up.{{r|Civil War II: Gods of War #2}}\n\nAfter failing to defeat them in previous battle, Hercules and the Gods of War decided to attack the Uprising Storm in their hideout.
