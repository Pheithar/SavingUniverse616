Trying to investigate Black Spectre's real goals, Daredevil discovered that their leader was [[Jerome Beechman (Earth-616)|Mandrill]], who used his pheromones to mind-control women to work for the Black Spectre. Mandrill intended to use his group to overthrown the government of United States and start a reign of chaos. Even with the help of the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] and [[Shanna O'Hara (Earth-616)|Shanna the She-Devil]], the Spectre was hard to defeat.{{r|Daredevil #109|112}}{{r|Marvel Two-In-One #3}}\n\nSometime later, they resurfaced as one of the many organizations that formed an alliance with [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], the [[Secret Empire (Earth-616)|Secret Empire]], [[Agence Byzantine (Earth-616)|Agence Byzantine]] and [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon Oil]].{{Citation}}\n\nWhen Daredevil stole the [[Omegadrive]], an object that contained data on each crime organization, from them, Agenc\u00e9 Byzantine tried many times to retrieve it, as well as the rest of the organizations. Black Spectre also framed the [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] for theft in an attempt to recruit her to steal the Omegadrive back, but she backed out of their deal and left a note to warn Matt. With help from [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]], Daredevil was able to send the information of Black Spectre to the [[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Daily Bugle]] resulting in Black Spectre being shut down as a warning to the other crime organizations.{{Citation}}\n\nLater on, hoping to get the other Megacrime organizations off his back, Daredevil had his teammates in the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] disguise themselves as Black Spectre agents so that they could steal the drive, fooling the other organizations into thinking Black Spectre has it, when in fact they no longer existed.{{Citation}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
