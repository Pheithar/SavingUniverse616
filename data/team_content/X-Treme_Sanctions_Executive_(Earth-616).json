Though initially Storm acted alone, she soon signed up the other members of the [[X-Treme X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Treme X-Men]] as officers, forming a legitimate mutant organization (though not the first, with the second [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] having been government-run). \n\nAfter a confrontation with the [[Fury (Earth-616)|Fury]], Cannonball took a leave of absence to recuperate from his injuries. He then joined the newly reformed [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] team, but and then returned to the X.S.E. team. [[Sage (Earth-616)|Sage]], meanwhile, rejoined the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] to keep an eye on [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Roberto Da Costa]] (who had become the new Lord Imperial) to make sure he was not corrupted by power, like [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]]. After the effects of M-day Storm stayed in the African country of [[Niganda]] to help bring things back to normal.  \n\nSince [[Decimation|M-Day]] and the enactment of the [[SHRA]], the team has largely ceased its activities as Law enforcement,{{r|X-Men: Future History: Messiah War Sourcebook #1}} concentrating on cleaning up the damage from the day and liaising with the US Governments O*N*E program.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   =  * Though founded in the latter issues of the ''X-Treme X-Men'' comic book, the team's adventures have transferred to ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' following the return of writer [[Chris Claremont]] to that book.\n* [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] and [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] were also associated with XSE, although they were seemingly not official members. A letters page claimed [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]] was also a member of the team, but this has never been borne out by the actual stories.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mutant Police Forces]]"
