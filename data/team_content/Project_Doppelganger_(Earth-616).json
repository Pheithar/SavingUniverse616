The first LMD of the project Doppelganger was the [[Master Matrix (Earth-616)|Master Matrix]], he was created by [[Mary Parker (Earth-616)|Mary]] and [[Richard Parker (Earth-616)|Richard Parker]]; the Matrix was to be the guide of the future Super-LMDs, but Mary created a better machine: a living machine. Fury disapproved of this and created the [[Project Doppelganger (Earth-616)/Life-Model Decoys#Galan|Galactus LMD]] to stop the Matrix in the worst case scenario, but Mary hid her work on Master Matrix. Years later the [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]] discovered the Parkers' work,{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 28}} and decided to sell the LMDs on the black market. He freed the robots and reprogrammed them to do what he wanted them to,{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 30}} but [[Project Doppelganger (Earth-616)/Life-Model Decoys#Sergei Kravinoff|Kraven the Hunter's LMD]] and the others LMDs rebelled against Chameleon because they wanted to free Master Matrix. [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], and other heroes who was on the trail of Chameleon found the latter defeated and they were attacked by the robots;{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 31}} in the end the LMDs won and Spider-Man and his friends were captured.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 33}} The LMDs freed the Master Matrix and he transformed the robots into Deadpool LMDs because a Deadpool LMD didn't exist, and the Matrix wanted to free humanity from death, transforming humans into Life-Model Decoys. Because of a malfunctioning [[Time Platform]], Deadpool of Earth-616 and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-18236)|the old Deadpool of Earth-18236]] swapped realities and the old version managed to tell the sharks [[Bruce (Shark) (Earth-616)|Bruce]] and [[Deborah (Shark) (Earth-616)|Deborah]] how to free the heroes and the battle began, but the LMDs defeated the heroes and escaped. Meanwhile, Deadpool of Earth-616 and [[Peter Parker (Earth-18236)|the old Spider-Man of Earth-18236]] arrived in Earth-616 and they paired up with their counterparts to search for the Matrix. When the two Spider-Men found Master Matrix, they explained that what he wanted to do was wrong, but Chameleon activated Galactus' LMD and shot the Matrix.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 35}} While all the heroes attacked the giant, Kraven's LMD repaired Master Matrix and he used all the LMDs to make a giant robot to fight Galactus, but the Chameleon's giant destroyed the other, so Deadpool crashed his S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier into Galactus and the battle was won. Both Deadpools renounced their mission to kill Master Matrix and the two old heroes disappeared as their future was erased.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 36}} \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = The LMDs seem to have a telepathic connection, how demonstrate the dialogue beetween Kraven's LMD and Captain America's LMD.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 31}}\n| Links                   = \n}}"
