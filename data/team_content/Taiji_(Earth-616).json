Based in Shanghai, Taiji supplies [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] with technology/weapons that are more advanced than what A.I.M. possesses.\n\nThe corporation itself has neither a C.E.O, shareholders, or employees. It's a front but it's unknown as for whom. According to Coldmoon and Dragonfire, Taiji is infecting Earth with alien technology. Which will enslave mankind, if they are not stopped.{{r|Point One Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:Chinese Organizations]]"
