As the assassins failed to kill Montesi, they were given to Lilith, who had the [[Lilin]] [[Doc (Lilin) (Earth-616)|Doc]] reshape them to be faster and stronger. Their next attack on the \"[[Darkhold Redeemers (Earth-616)|Darkhold Redeemers]]\" (joined by [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|John Blaze]] and the [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider (Dan Ketch)]]) was repelled as well.{{r|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins #1}}<!-- \n\nMeanwhile, the [[Darkhold Dwarf (Earth-616)|Darkhold Dwarf]] appeared in various locations, offering \"guidance\" to people receiving pages of the Darkhold by letter.{{r|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins #1}}{{r|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins #2}} -->\n\nAfter Lilith's defeat, the Darkholders sent hitmen to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to kill the Darkhold Redeemers (somehow knowing they were going there).{{r|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins #2}}<!-- \n\n... apparently decimated during in Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins -->\n\n====The Red Slayer====\nThey later took interest in [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]].
