With one of the Prime disguising himself as the Fantastic Four's mailman [[William Lumpkin (Earth-616)|Willie Lumpkin]], he incapacitated the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Girl]], [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]], and the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]], then disposed of them by sending them a few hours in the future in their [[Time Platform]]. \n\nThe Prime Ten's attempt to steal the transmitter failed when Mister Fantastic used the device to bring in the [[Kree]] hero [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]]. They held their own against the Prime Ten until Reed's time displaced teammates caught up with them and helped defeat the Skrulls. Reed had his comrades toss the Prime Ten back through the portal, overloading his machine in the process causing it to explode.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #15}} Presumably the Skrulls crossed over to a Skrull lab the portal ended, but they have not been seen since. This subsequent fate is unknown.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Ray blasters, a stunner device.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
