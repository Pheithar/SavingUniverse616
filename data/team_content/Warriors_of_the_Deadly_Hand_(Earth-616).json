As with the other Houses, it implied that as an homage to their namesake [[Deadly Warriors (Earth-616)|Deadly Warrior]], the Warriors of the Deadly Hand were dressed in red and specialized in unarmed combat.  \n| History                 = [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]]'s defection from [[Zheng Zu (Earth-616)|Zheng Zu]]'s criminal organization and his subsequent campaign against his father left the House of the Deadly Hand in shambles, and its Warriors defunct.{{r|Shang-Chi Vol 1 1}}  As a result, they were the only Warriors to not present for Shang-Chi's ascension to Supreme Commander.{{r|Shang-Chi Vol 1 5}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = While it is never explicitly stated to how the Warriors of the Deadly Hand disbanded, it is possible that Zheng Zu's [[Celestial Order of the Si-Fan (Earth-616)|Si-Fan]], [[Order of the Golden Dawn (Earth-616)|Golden Dawn]] and [[Celestial Order of the Hai-Dai (Earth-616)|Hai-Dai]] assassins Shang-Chi and other superheroes fought and defeated over the years were in fact the Warriors of the Deadly Hand.  All three organizations were confirmed to be aliases for the Five Weapons Society and Zheng Zu used the House of the Deadly Hand as the main base for his operations.  Modern stories have the Si-Fan and Hai-Dai garbed in red, the main color associated with the Deadly Hand.  \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n\n[[Category:Chinese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Martial Arts]]\n[[Category:Assassins]]\n[[Category:Five Weapons Society]]"
