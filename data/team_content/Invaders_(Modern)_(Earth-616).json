The Invaders were also assisted by former [[Glossary:Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] hero The [[Peter Noble (Earth-616)|Fin]] and his Atlantean wife Nia, although they did not officially join the team.\n\nThey were formed by the putative U.S. Secretary of Defense Dell Rusk\u2014in actuality the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]]\u2014who coerced the Thin Man into gathering this new team, which the Skull intended to use for his own goals. The new Invaders eventually learned of the plan, however and thwarted it, but at the cost of the apparent \"death\" of the android Human Torch. The majority of the members quit the team after this.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = the [[Infiltrator]], Duragen Statoplanes\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * In 2004 new Invaders team was created in four-issue arc \"Once an Invader...\", beginning with {{cl|Avengers Vol 3 82}}.
