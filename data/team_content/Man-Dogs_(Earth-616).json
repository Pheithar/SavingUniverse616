It was [[Mexico]]'s biggest new drug supplier. Even the Cartels were afraid of him. The man was always on the road, traveling in a convoy with a mobile drug lab in the back of a trailer. Burying the dead wherever they wanted. Gang members wore studded dog collars, filed their teeth, and made dog sounds. \n\nDue to his last chemist producing a bad batch that killed customers from [[El Paso]] to [[Alabama (State)|Alabama]], he was looking for a new chemist and  killed the old one by tossing him out the back of a moving trailer tied to a chain. The Hulk and the Punisher caught up to the convoy and took it out, with Hulk killing the Pit Bull the same way he killed the chemist.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 8}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mexican Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Cartels]]"
