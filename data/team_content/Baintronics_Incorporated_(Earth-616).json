She built the company using prototypes stolen from [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]], having seduced [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] to learn his company's security codes.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 19}} The corporate HQ [[Baintronics, Inc. Facility]] was located in [[Seattle]], some distance south and west of Evergreen Island.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 11}}\n\nBaintronics had a history of actively working against Tony Stark and his companies, especially against the think tank named [[Stark Unlimited (Earth-616)|Stark Unlimited]] that he founded after coming back from a coma.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 2}} Bain began to collude with Tony's brother [[Arno Stark (Earth-616)|Arno]]{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 15}} but was betrayed by Arno who switched her out with a [[Sunset Bain (Duplicate) (Earth-616)|A.I. duplicate]].{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 4}} With the duplicate's help, Arno eventually managed to depose Tony from Stark Unlimited. Arno seized control of the company and merged it with Baintronics.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 19}}\n\nArno and Bain used Baintronics to oppress A.I. beings as Arno believed that an Extinction Entity was coming to assimilate all A.I.s and organic life, leading them to come to blows with the [[A.I. Army (Earth-616)|A.I. Army]], a group dedicated to equal rights for robotic lifeforms that was led by Tony who now believed that he was an A.I. and went by the moniker Mark One.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 1}}\n\nTo bring all robotkind under his control, Arno tried broadcasting a submission code that would make all A.I.s subservient using a broadcast tower from Baintronics' [[Bain Tower]]. The A.I. Army managed to stop the broadcast but at the apparent cost of Mark One's life.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 2|3}}\n\nArno and Bain eventually lost control of Baintronics and Stark Unlimited; Arno was placed in a perpetual virtual reality dream by the revitalized Tony after realizing that the so-called Extinction Entity was just a delusion, and Bain was made by [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]] to take all the blame for the A.I. Army's and Arno's actions.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 6}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]\n[[Category:Arms Dealers]]"
