Prior to this occurrence, they had been experimented on by [[Dust (New Wave) (Earth-616)|Dust]] and [[Silence (New Wave) (Earth-616)|Silence]] and had powers that were activated due to Alison's light. They first fought Dazzler, [[O.Z. Chase (Earth-616)|O.Z. Chase]], and the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] at a bar using all their powers combined. At one stage, during this fight the Beyonder gave them power boosts. After their failure, Stomper was next seen in the employ of Dust. Unfortunately for Stomper, he was possessed by Dust and his body used to get to Alison Blaire's father [[Carter Blaire (Earth-616)|Carter Blaire]], leading to the deaths of both Stomper and Mr. Blaire.{{r|Dazzler Vol 1 40|41}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Motorcycles\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
