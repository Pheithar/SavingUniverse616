Their principal work together was the stealing of the different parts of the [[Library of Alexandria]], scattered in [[Wakanda]], [[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantis]], and [[Olympia]]. Their activities caused the coming of the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]], by using a tachyon ray, and they also healed the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom Symbiote]] in the aftermath of the [[Secret Wars (1984 Event)|Secret Wars]]. Eventually, the Intel was betrayed by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] and disbanded. But later, when the Hulk returned to Earth and decided to wage war on the planet, [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|MODOK]] and the [[Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)|Leader]] reformulated the team, hacking into defense satellites and channeling cosmic energy through them which ultimately led to the Hulk's defeat. Through this information they gathered, the Intelligencia discovered how to combine gamma and cosmic radiation to create a powerful being.{{r|Fall of the Hulks: Alpha #1}} \n\nThey approached [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|General Ross]] and convinced him to become their ultimate weapon, the Red Hulk, as part of an scheme to defeat the Hulk and conquer the world.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 23}} Many of the Hulk's allies were captured, brainwashed and transformed into Cosmic-[[Gamma Mutates]], like [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Red She-Hulk]]{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 610}}, [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|A-Bomb]]{{r|Fall of the Hulks: Red Hulk Vol 1 3}} and [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus Cho]].{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 608}} The plan ultimately failed, Amadeus used his recently gained powers to change MODOK back into George Tarleton again{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 610}} and the Red Hulk drained the Leader's body of all radiation and he was no longer the Leader.{{r|Hulk Vol 2 23}}\n\nA more recent line-up, composed of [[George Tarleton (M.O.D.O.K. Superior) (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K. Superior]], the [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|Wizard]], the [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]] and his [[Awesome Android (Earth-616)|Awesome Android]], the [[Ivan Kragoff (Earth-616)|Red Ghost]] and his [[Super-Apes (Earth-616)|Super-Apes]], and the [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]] disguised as [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Klaw]], developed a new weapon with the ability of sending specific objects to space, called the Zero Cannon. With it, the [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Six]] kill the [[Winter Guard (Earth-616)|Winter Guard]], though M.O.D.O.K., some [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] agents, and one Super-Ape survived.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 676}}\n\nM.O.D.O.K. then managed to revive the dead members of the Intelligencia, as well as make space for the [[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Trapster]] to join them, and formulate a plan after their predicted shattering of the superhero community. Their meeting was interrupted by [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], who tried to sink the ship they were on, but he was defeated by Trapster.{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 55}}\n\nThe Intelligencia appeared to disband after some of its members, including the Wizard and the Mad Thinker, were apprehended by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Victor von Doom, who had turned a new leaf and took up the mantle of Iron Man]].{{r|Infamous Iron Man Vol 1 6}} Some time later, in its place a [[New Intelligencia (Earth-616)|New Intelligencia]] arose.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 3 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = Formerly [[Liddleville]], [[Cathexis Ray]]\n| Transportation          = Formerly Hellcarrier\n| Weapons                 = Formerly Zero Cannon\n\n| Notes                   = * Intelligencia created a list to rank the smartest men on Earth.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n* [[wikipedia:Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia at Wikipedia.org]]\n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Think Tanks]]"
