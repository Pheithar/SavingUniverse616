After betraying the dictator, Hendrik revealed that he was part of the Belavian Underground Resistance and that they even had a plan to dispose of Zetaxas' minions. Some seconds later, a team of insurgents came out of nowhere, one of whom stated that without his two hundred top officers, Igor stood no chance against them. Thanks to them, [[Belavia]] was finally set free from Igor.{{r|Tales of Suspense #4}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
