In the 1950s they got into heroin and made a generous offer to the Castigliones to use their fishing boats. They refused and one of the Castigliones was killed by the Bessucho, another had left for America, and the final brother avenged his murdered brother by killing the don and then disappeared. Recently the Bessuchos were trading weapons to the Libyans for heroin.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 25|27}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Ship with helicopter landing pad,{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 26}} Gunboat (with cannon){{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 26|27}}\n| Weapons                 = Small-bore single-barrel cannon (on boat){{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 26|27}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Crime Families]]\n[[Category:Cosa Nostra]]\n[[Category:Italian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]"
