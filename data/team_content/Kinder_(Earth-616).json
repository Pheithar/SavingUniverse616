The two lived together in the Castle Zemo ancestral home and organized the Kinder. Named for the Nazi Wunderkinder (Wonder Kids, a.k.a. the Hitler Youth), the Kinder were a group of abducted children, who were originally captured as part of a white slavery ring by [[Damon Dran (Earth-616)|Damon Dran]]. Zemo and the Baroness picked 25 children whom they deemed worthy and adopted them into their home in Castle Zemo. These children were essentially brainwashed into developing a fanatical devotion to the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi Party]] in general, and Zemo and the Baroness in particular. Captain America and his partner [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]] followed a lead on the missing children and defeated Zemo and the Baroness, freeing the children.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Zemo Family]]"
