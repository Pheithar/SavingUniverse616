During the final [[Glossary:Incursion|incursion]] that caused the clash between [[Earth-616]] and Earth-1610, with both universe's planets [[Earth]] acting as the collision point of this phenomenon, [[James Hudson Jr. (Earth-1610)|Jimmy Hudson]], [[Pietro Lensherr (Earth-1610)|Quicksilver]], [[Nomi Blume (Earth-1610)|Mach-II]], [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-1610)|Armor]] and [[Derek Morgan (Earth-1610)|Guardian]] fell from their reality into the other. When the [[Multiverse]] was eventually rebuilt, these mutants became stranded in the Prime Earth, suffering from amnesia as a by-product of their transition from one reality to another.\n\nThese five foreign mutants were abducted by super-villain geneticist [[Claudine Renko (Earth-616)|Miss Sinister]], who brainwashed and turned them into her personal enforcers, the New Marauders. After Jimmy's natural resistance to telepathy allowed him to break free from Miss Sinister's control and he escaped,{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 5}} the remaining New Marauders were deployed to retrieve him. In the process, the New Marauders confronted the [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|young X-Men]], who had tracked down Jimmy after he was detected by [[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebro]].{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 4}} Following a brief confrontation against the X-Men and Jimmy, during which [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]] learned of Miss Sinister's involvement, the New Marauders were ordered by their superior to leave.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 5}}\n\nThe New Marauders remained by Miss Sinister's side as she allied herself with [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] and [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]] to release [[Mothervine]] globally with the intent to make mutantkind the dominant species.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 23}} They were sent to recruit [[Shen Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]] to Havok's cause, but  two of the young X-Men, Jimmy Hudson and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-21710)|Bloodstorm]], inteverened and rescued him.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 24}} Shortly afterwards, the New Marauders were sent to attack [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], who had threatened Havok's plans.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 26}} Magneto evaded them and escaped using his time platform.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 27}} Following the capture of the young X-Men, Emma Frost finally rejected Miss Sinister's ideals, and took psychic control of the New Marauders and turned them upon their mistress. However, Miss Sinister activated a kill-switch she had implanted in their genetic code, killing all three instantly.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 28}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
