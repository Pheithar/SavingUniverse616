In 1965, [[Symbiote Dragons|an alien dragon]] made of [[Symbiotes|living darkness]] was discovered frozen in a glacier by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and codenamed [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]]. A team led by [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] began experimenting with samples extracted from the Grendel and discovered they could be bonded to host organisms to create predatory monsters. Under pressure from the government to produce a replacement for the M.I.A. [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], Fury initiated a [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|symbiote-supersoldier program]] in 1966 and field-tested it during the [[Vietnam War]], to disastrous results.{{r|Venom Vol 4 2}}{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam Vol 1 1}} After the Sym-Soldier Program was declared a failure by S.H.I.E.L.D. and officially shut down, Weapon Plus surreptitiously took over and rebranded the initiative as \"Weapon V\" or \"Project Venom\" - appropriating personnel, research, and symbiote samples while crediting Fury as the founder.{{r|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}<!--{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}-->\n\nOver the next few decades, Weapon V closely monitored subsequent [[United States Government (Earth-616)|U.S. Government]]-initiated offshoots of the Sym-Soldier Program such as [[Project Rebirth (Earth-616)|Project Rebirth 2.0]] and the [[Mercury Team (Earth-616)|Mercury Team]], appropriating research and technology from them. Learning from their successes and failures, Weapon V determined that the Sym-Soldier prototypes had been corrupted by the [[Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)|symbiote hive-mind]] and were able to create suits of bio-armor virally-altered to be free of the contamination.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n\nSeven weeks after the Grendel symbiote-dragon reawakened and attacked Manhattan,{{r|Venom Vol 4 2|6}} the [[Weapon V Headquarters]] was attacked by the symbiote-augmented serial killer [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]], who had bonded to [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a sample of the Grendel symbiote]] and been greatly empowered by its connection to [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], the dark elder god who had created the symbiotes billions of years ago. Most of the personnel were slaughtered, but [[Mars Team (Earth-616)|Mars Team]] - a strikeforce led by [[Robert Urquhart III (Earth-616)|Robert Urquhart]] - managed to escape and plot revenge by forcibly enlisting the aid of fellow Weapon Plus experiment [[Clayton Cortez (Earth-616)|Weapon H]]. However, Weapon V's head of research and development, [[Andrew Breen (Earth-616)|Dr. Andrew Breen]], went insane and sabotaged Mars Team's fight against Carnage, enabling him to kill them all.<!--{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}-->\n\nIn the aftermath, Weapon V was subsequently shuttered by the head of Weapon Plus, [[William Junger (Earth-616)|Director Junger]], until the threat posed by Carnage had passed.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}} Following this, the program was restarted with [[Randall Pierce (Earth-616)|Dr. Randall Pierce]] as its new head researcher.{{r|Weapon Plus: World War IV Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               =\n* '''Sym-Suits:''' Weapon V's operatives are bonded to symbiote bio-armor engineered from samples of the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]] symbiote-dragon. Current-generation Sym-Suits have been virally altered to be disconnected from the corrupting influence of the symbiote hive-mind.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = In addition to wielding military ordinance, Weapon V operatives can use their symbiotes to manifest claws, fangs, spikes, tendrils, and blades.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n| Notes                   = * In {{cl|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}, Nick Fury is named as the lead of Weapon V in reference to his role as the head of the Sym-Soldier Program. This was retconned in {{cl|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}, which established that Weapon V was a secret offshoot of the Sym-Soldier Program established by Weapon Plus after S.H.I.E.L.D. shut it down.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Symbiotes-possessed]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]\n[[Category:Weapon Plus Projects]]\n[[Category:Super-Soldier Programs]]\n[[Category:Symbiote-Enhanced Organizations]]"
