To do so, and following Set's indication, he had allied with [[Llyra]].\n\nGhaur marked seven superhuman women with the Mark of Set to place them under his control and named them the [[Brides of Set]]. Ghaur wanted them to mate with Set and provide him with sons, one bride for each of Set's heads. Ghaur did not notice that, although the Brides were under his control, they did everything in their power to resist him (for instance, when ordered to fight for him, they tried to lose).\n\nWhen Ghaur's initial plan to destroy Atlantis did not bring Set to Earth, he sent [[Andromeda Attumasen (Earth-616)|Andromeda]] to recover a sphere with a part of Set's life essence from Neptune's Rage Altar. The Scarlet Witch would then use her power to alter probability on the sphere, freeing enough energy to make Set come. The operation was a success and Set came to Earth.\n\nAfter [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] defeated Set, Ghaur and Llyra returned to Lemuria and tried to sacrifice the Seven Brides to bring power to the Serpent Crown and thus bring Set back. They sent their armies of Deviants and Lemurians to fight the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] and the [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]], while Ghaur mentally probed the insides of the Crown. Doing so, Ghaur accidentally released the spirit of a previous holder of the Crown, Emperor [[Naga (Lemurian) (Earth-616)|Naga]] of Lemuria, who also wanted the power of the Crown. Naga and Ghaur fought using their mental powers, and finally both them and Llyra vanished.\n\nFinally fred from Ghaur's mind control, the formerly-known as Brides of Set threw the Serpent Crown to a submarine cave.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
