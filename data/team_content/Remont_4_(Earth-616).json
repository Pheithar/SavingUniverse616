The other members include Titanium Man, Unicorn, Volga and the Snow Leopards. Their goals are based on the 'Remont' plan -- a rebirth of Soviet Russia to the glory days of Stalin.\n\nThe team began as the Remont 4 under the leadership of Crimson Dynamo. Shalatov wanted to restore Russia to its former glory and formed the Remont 4 as a means to that end. Under circumstances beyond his control, Shalatov was forced to help Iron Man defeat a crazed Titanium Man when he remotely had the Dynamo Armor (which was being piloted by Tony Stark). Because this sanctioning was not \"officially authorized\" Shalatov was reassigned and the Dynamo Armor was taken from him -- effectively dissolving the Remont 4 for some time.\n\nReformed as the Remont 6 the group features two of the original members. This group comes into conflict with the [[Winter Guard (Earth-616)|Winter Guard]] after they raid an A.I.M. facility.{{Citation}}\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n* Remont means \"repair\" or \"overhaul\"\n| Links                   = \n}}"
