Once Magneto defeated Exodus, the Sleepers were freed from his control. He later put them under [[Shen Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]]'s care in [[Tibet]], with the intention to have them protected while at the same time having them at his disposal in case the were needed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 14}}\n\nWhen the united X-Men factions launched an attack on [[New Attilan]] as part of a plan to destroy the [[Terrigen Mist|Terrigen Cloud]] that caused M-Pox, he had Xorn and the Sleepers march and become the overseers of the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] population held captive at their home.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 18}}\n\nFollowing the [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|conflict with the Inhumans]], Xorn relocated to the [[Blue Area of the Moon|Blue Area]] of the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]] and left the Sleepers under the command of [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 19}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
