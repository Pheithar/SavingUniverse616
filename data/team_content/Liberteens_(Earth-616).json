They were based on the [[World War II]] team the [[Liberty Legion (WWII) (Earth-616)|Liberty Legion]]. Each member as a similar motif and power to a member of that team.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Annual Vol 1 1}}\n\nTheir first mission was to take down a group calling themselves Ultimatum, led by the new [[Guy Thierrault (Earth-616)|Flag-Smasher]], which was apparently funded by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] and whose aim was to destroy the [[Liberty Bell]] as a symbolic gesture. The Liberteens managed to defeat Ultimatum with little trouble with [[Erika Kelley (Earth-616)|Ms. America]] taking down the Flag-Smasher by herself.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Annual Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe [[Revolutionary (Earth-616)|Revolutionary]] was is in fact a [[Skrull]] infiltrator. He was involved in a plan to place a Skrull on  every team in the Initiative. Eventually, the [[Skrull Kill Krew (Earth-616)|Skrull Kill Krew]] and a loosely organized band of Initiative members revealed the Revolutionary's true identity. They assisted [[Ariana Diamante (Earth-616)|Hope]] and [[Whiz Kid (Earth-616)|Whiz Kid]] of the Liberteens in defeating him. [[Greg Willis (Earth-616)|Gravity]] dropped the diamond-skinned Hope on top of the Revolutionary and dramatically amplified her mass, crushing him to a bloody pulp. Hope stayed behind in Pennsylvania to help her wounded team members. Whiz Kid was later asked to join the Skrull Kill Krew in their search for the remaining Skrull sleeper agents among the other Initiative teams, but died saving the team by creating a tornado to suck away poisonous gas.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 18|19}}\n\nThe team apparently disbanded at an unknown point in time as members [[Darell Paine (Earth-616)|2-D]], [[Ariana Diamante (Earth-616)|Hope]], [[Jack Pierce (Iceberg) (Earth-616)|Iceberg]], and [[Erika Kelley (Earth-616)|Ms. America]] came together to form a new team called the [[Fantastix (Earth-616)|Fantastix]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 4}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each teammates' arsenal\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The Liberteens and their name were based on the [[World War II]] team the [[Liberty Legion (WWII) (Earth-616)|Liberty Legion]].\n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.1778.Initiative_Initiation:_The_Liberteens Liberteens at Marvel.com]\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Legion#Liberteens Liberteens at Wikipedia.org]\n}}\n[[Category:50-State Initiative]]"
