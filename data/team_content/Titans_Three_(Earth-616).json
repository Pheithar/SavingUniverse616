Namor feared that this machine would explode if operated past a certain power level and wanted his [[Atlantean]] scientists to test it to ensure its safety before the U.N. put it into operation.<!-- {{r|Sub-Mariner Vol 1 35}} -->\n\nThe military, however, were distrustful of the trio due to their past activities and the government called in the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] to prevent them from destroying the device. [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Goliath]] responded to the call, as the other members of the Avengers were gone to do a T.V. charity spot. The Avengers realized their error when [[Ikthon (Earth-616)|Ikthon]] proved to everyone present that the device would have become unstable and exploded if used at full power, just like Namor feared. The Avengers would leave on good terms with the Trio, who would then disband shortly after.{{r|Sub-Mariner Vol 1 35}} They would, however, gather again many times after as a group known as the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]].{{r|Defenders Vol 1 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
