The cult was made up of impressionable young people seeking knowledge and direction. What they found instead was a power-hungry mutant, who used their own mental energies to fuel his own powers. Also, believing that they were worshiping God, they were really carrying out pagan rites for a race of demons living in another dimension. Jeremiah used his powers to keep the Innocents in a hypnotic trance-like state and they would do anything he commanded of them. When Jeremiah found himself fighting against the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]], his followers even tried to obey his command to walk into a wall of flame, causing the Human Torch to relent in his attack. Eventually Jeremiah was stopped through the combined efforts of the Human Torch and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]]. Once out of contact with Jeremiah, the other cultists were freed of his influence{{r|Marvel Team-Up Vol 1 #33|35}}.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Earth Religions]]"
