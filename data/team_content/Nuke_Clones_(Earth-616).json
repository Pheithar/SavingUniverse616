They first disrupted a protest between [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] sympathizers and their oppositors in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and opened fire at anyone on sight.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2018 Avengers}} They were taken down by the combined efforts of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], the [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]] and [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]].{{r|Captain America Vol 9 1}}\n\nAfter carrying out other several attacks in different parts of the country, the Nuke clones targeted the site of the World Conference of Mayors in Chicago. After setting the building on fire, they were intercepted and defeated by Captain America before any fatalities could ensue.{{r|Captain America Vol 9 2}} With [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]]'s help, Captain America located the lab producing the Nukes, hidden beneath the mines of a small town. Wakanan intelligence had determined that the Nukes burned out a few days after activation. When Captain America, Black Panther and [[Okoye (Earth-616)|Okoye]] raided the laboratory, they located the central command unit and uploaded a virus concocted by Black Panther which reduced the burnout time from days to seconds, killing the dozens of Nukes on standby, as well as hundreds in stasis.{{r|Captain America Vol 9 3}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Clones]]"
