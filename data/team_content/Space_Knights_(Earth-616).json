Core made the [[Perans]]' weapons special and their warriors, led by [[Horn (Earth-616)|Horn]], freed their planet from slavery.\n\nBut weapons are not made for peace, and thus if idle too long, the Core would corrupt the warriors, and so they took the weapons off world, traveling the galaxy and freeing the oppressed before moving on. Various others joined their efforts and they came to be known as the '''Space Knights'''; however, their endeavors drew the ire of a monster named [[Lurgh (Earth-616)|Lurgh]], who united the Space Knights' enemies in an effort to hunt them to extinction. To this end, Lurgh's forces pursued Horn's warriors back to Pera, destroying the planet and the Space Knights along with it, their name and exploits fading into the stuff of myth.\n\nThen a [[Kree]] named [[Mahia (Earth-616)|Mahia]] discovered a piece of Core, or maybe it was the other way around, but she used her newfound power to reform the Space Knights, beginning with a rescue of [[J'k (Earth-616)|J'k]] from being assimilated, and together they helped save [[Punch (Earth-616)|Punch]]'s homeworld from an alien invasion.{{r|Guardians of Infinity Vol 1 7}}\n\nThe three of them then teamed up with [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]] to rescue another Space Knight, [[Earo (Earth-616)|Earo]], along with [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax the Destroyer]], from [[Durgh]] on [[Hool]].{{r|Guardians of Infinity Vol 1 2}}\n\nSometime later J'k and Punch were on their way to rescue Earo and Mahia from [[Cairbre (Earth-616)|Caber]] and the [[Duynans]] when [[Wink (Earth-616)|Wink]] first joined the team, hurling the [[Tuatha de Danaan]] off a cliff on [[Duyna]].{{r|Guardians of Infinity Vol 1 7}}\n\nThe Space Knights next encountered [[Iqa (Earth-616)|Iqa]], [[Hilla Rollo (Earth-616)|Hilla Rollo]], [[Pik Rollo (Earth-616)|Pik Rollo]], and [[Tarna (Earth-616)|Tarna]] on [[Wenb]] when both groups were looking for a purifying elixir.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 11}} In the Space Knight's case, they were looking for it to restore Wink's broken wings.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 12}} After settling their differences, the Space Knights accompanied the other aliens to [[Earth]], where [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Mania]], the person they were looking the elixir for, lived. After helping [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Venom]] subdue Mania and inject her with the elixir, Iqa, Hilla, Pik, Tarna, and [[803 (Earth-616)|803]] decided to join the Space Knights while Venom remained on Earth together with Mania.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 13}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Cosmic Teams]]\n[[Category:Orders of Knights]]"
