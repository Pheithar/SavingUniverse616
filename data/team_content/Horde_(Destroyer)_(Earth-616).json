They were frequently opposed by the [[Kevin Marlow (Earth-616)|Destroyer]] and an as yet unknown government security force. When the Destroyer learned of the location of Horde's central headquarters, he led an assault on the base and his partner, [[Darius (Destroyer) (Earth-616)|Turret]] killed their leader [[Krakoom (Earth-616)|Krakoom]]. Horde seems to have dissolved following the death of Krakoom.{{r|Destroyer Vol 3 1|2}}{{r|Destroyer Vol 3 4}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Teleporters\n| Weapons                 = Explosives, a high-tech arsenal of weaponry, mutated soldiers\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
