They first appeared during the largest Atlantean invasion yet attempted, the so-called \"Atlantis Attacks\" affair. However, instead of joining their brethren, the Surf acted as outlaws, saving several surface dwellers from harm. They remained together as Atlantean outlaws ever since.{{r|New Mutants Annual Vol 1 5}}\n\nLater, the members of Surf attempted to forcibly liberate several whales from their tanks at MarineWorld in Southern California. They were stopped by members of the Avengers' West Coast branch, and made to know that the whales are kept safe, although not terribly pleased that humans still kept them for study and for performances.{{r|West Coast Avengers Annual Vol 2 5}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/surfatlan.htm\n* Unofficial Handbook of the Marvel Universe\n}}"
