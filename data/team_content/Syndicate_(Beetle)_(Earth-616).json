Its main purpose was to support women in their efforts to commit crime, with the inclusion of mentorship programs and salons. Their base included open-plan workrooms for plotting and scheming, a state-of-the-art on-site childcare facility, and a shared kitchen. In their beginning, the Syndicate focused on going after offender they'd found especially egregious.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 26}}\n\nAfter rescuing [[Francine Frye (Earth-616)|Electro]] from police custody,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 25}} the Beetle introduced her to the team's ethos and invited her to join. She refused until Beetle shared with her the identity of their first target, [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]], who had previously betrayed Electro.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 26}} The Syndicate attacked the [[F.E.A.S.T. Center]] and managed to capture him despite [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]'s intervention.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 27}} Behind her teammates' back, the Beetle made a deal with the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] to have him besiege the Syndicate's base and take Boomerang in exchange for deputizing the Syndicate. All of Beetles' partners were disgruntled with both her actions and her proposal to work legitimately, but they agreed to help Boomerang evade capture after he disclosed with the Syndicate the secret reason Kingpin was after after him. The Syndicate fended off Kingpin's forces while Spider-Man escaped with Boomerange, and all members save for Beetle were arrested afterwards. As they were being taken away, Beetle broke them out of the police transport.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 28}}\n\nLater, the Syndicate was contracted by [[Miles Morales (Earth-616)|Ultimatum]] to kill the [[Aaron Davis (Earth-1610)|Prowler]]. Scorpia, White Rabbit, and Trapstr ambushed the Prowler and the young [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Spider-Man]] on the streets of [[Brooklyn]]. Morales quickly knocked White Rabbit unconscious, but the Prowler suggested that he and Morales should retreat, as they were outmatched. Trapstr tracked the pair down and, along with Scorpia, nearly killed the Prowler, but both women were shot with tranquilizer darts from [[Tiana Toomes (Earth-616)|Starling]].{{r|Miles Morales: Spider-Man Vol 1 13}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The Syndicate was funded entirely by [[Lorina Dodson (Earth-616)|White Rabbit]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 28}}\n* [[Mariah Dillard (Earth-616)|Black Mariah]] once held a teleconference for the Syndicate.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 26}}\n| Links                   = \n}}"
