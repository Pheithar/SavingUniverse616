It promotes peace and moderation amongst the pantheons in all the universe.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #3}}\n\nShadrak was deemed the Parliament's representative in order to officiate the '''''Challenge of the Gods''''' between the Gods of the [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]], [[K'ythri (Earth-616)|K'ythri]] and [[Sharra (Earth-616)|Sharra]], and [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|the new Thor]].{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 16}}\n\nWhen the Shi'ar gods' abuse in their divine powers came to light, the Parliament apprehended them for their crimes and installed [[Quintavius Quire]] as a substitute god.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 19}}\n\nWhen [[Nyx (Earth-616)|Nyx]] was freed from her prison due to the machinations of the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] and [[Challenger (Elder of the Universe) (Earth-616)|Challenger]], she and her children slaughtered the [[Olympian Pantheon]] leaving only [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] the only survivor. The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] were sent to Omnipotence City by [[Va Nee Gast (Earth-616)|Voyager]] to locate one of the [[Night Shards]], Hercules attempted to convince the Lord Librarian to summon the aid of the gods in the city, but was refused as the Parliament saw it as an Olympian internal matter.{{r|Avengers No Road Home Vol 1 3}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Interdimensional Organizations]]"
