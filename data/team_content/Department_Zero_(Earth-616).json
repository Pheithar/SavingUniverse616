The U.S. Government let FBI Special Agent [[James Woo (Earth-616)|Jimmy Woo]] forge a special rescue team of unlikely heroes.Woo reviewed his files on active super-beings and instinctively selected a roster that came to him in a dream: Gorilla Man, Venus, Marvel Boy and aquatic heroine [[Aquaria Neptunia (Earth-616)|Namora]]. Namora declined to join the mission but found a replacement by helping Woo salvage the lost Human Robot.{{r|Agents of Atlas Vol 1 1}} \n\nMeshing smoothly as a team, Woo's \"Department Zero\" rescued Eisenhower and accomplished various other missions, repeatedly clashing with Atlas Foundation agents and pawns such as the mutated canine cosmonaut Laika; however, U.S. authorities ultimately decided the world was not ready for such bizarre heroes and disbanded the group, declaring their missions classified and records of their activities sealed.{{r|Agents of Atlas Vol 1 1}}\n\nMembers of this group would later go on to re-form as the [[Agents of Atlas (Earth-616)|Agents of Atlas]].{{r|Agents of Atlas Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * This team is based on [[Earth-9904|an alternate reality]], where this group would continue and become the [[Avengers (Earth-9904)|\"1950s\" Avengers]]\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:American Organizations]]"
