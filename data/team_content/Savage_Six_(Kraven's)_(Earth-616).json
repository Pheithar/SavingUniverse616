These Hunterbots were controlled by a cadre of wealthy would-be hunters tricked by Kraven into participating, unaware of the true danger behind his plan. When Kraven and his accomplice [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] presented this idea of their benefactors, they teased the kind of prey they would be hunting down by introducing six of the participating villains, the [[Adrian Toomes (Earth-616)|Vulture]], [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Scorpion]], [[Anton Miguel Rodriquez (Earth-616)|Tarantula]], [[Vincent Stegron (Earth-616)|Stegron]], [[Piet Voorhees (Earth-616)|King Cobra]], and [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]], as the Savage Six.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 16}}\n\nDuring the tournament, Kraven confronted [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and had a change of heart. He decided to shut down the operation and free his prisoners, who were subsequently apprehended by authorities. The six members of the Savage Six convened in the same convoy, and the [[Adrian Toomes (Earth-616)|Vulture]] suggested to formally join forces as the Savage Six.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 23}}\n\n===In Hollywood===\nWhen [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]] posed as the film director [[Cage McKnight (Earth-616)|Cage McKnight]] to make a self-biopic, the Savage Six were outraged that their personas were used in this movie without their permission and decided to crash the production.{{r|Amazing Mary Jane Vol 1 1|2}} They attacked the production crew, but Mysterio used his illusions for him and the crew to escape them.{{r|Amazing Mary Jane Vol 1 3}} Despite the crew's effort to avoid discovery by the Savage Six, the Six captured an actor named [[Character Index/C#Charlie|Charlie]] who used to work for the movie and told them the crew's current location.{{r|Amazing Mary Jane Vol 1 4}}\n\nAfter production was finished, the Six arrived to destroy the movie for good, but were confronted by actress [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]]. They did quick work with her, but then the movie crew, which now also included [[Master Matrix (Earth-616)|Master Matrix]], [[Screwball (Earth-616)|Screwball]], and [[Highly Engineered Robot Built for Interdimensional Exploration (Earth-616)|H.E.R.B.I.E.]], came to her aid and together managed to fend off the villains.{{r|Amazing Mary Jane Vol 1 5}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The [[Adrian Toomes (Earth-616)|Vulture]] once offered the [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] a spot in the Savage Six.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2020 Spider-Man/Venom}}\n| Links                   = \n}}"
