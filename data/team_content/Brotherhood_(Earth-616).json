At the beginning, it was founded by [[Marvin Hoffman (Earth-616)|Marvin Hoffman]], [[Orwell (Earth-616)|Orwell]] and [[Marshal (Earth-616)|Marshal]], but this last quit, facing Hoffman's lead, disillusioned, and join a governmental agency to take down the Brotherhood.{{r|Brotherhood #9}}\n\nLed by Marvin Hoffman, who took the name of '''X''', they possess numerous cells or active members in [[London (England)|London]],{{r|Brotherhood #4|7}} [[Moscow]],{{r|Brotherhood #1}} [[Bogot\u00e1]],{{r|Brotherhood #2}} [[France]],{{r|Brotherhood #5}} [[United States of America]],{{r|Brotherhood #1|4}}{{r|Brotherhood #6|9}} [[Bangkok]],{{r|Brotherhood #7}} [[Rome (Italy)|Rome]],{{r|Brotherhood #7}} [[Tokyo]] (described as the pride of the movement),{{r|Brotherhood #8}} [[Brazil]]{{r|Brotherhood #8}} and [[North America]].{{r|Brotherhood #8}} From the outside, Marshal tracked X and the Brotherhood, but Orwell keep him from takes Hoffman down, as he wanted to make the things get right. This period last for five years.{{r|Brotherhood #9}}\n\n===Recruitment of Mikey Asher and Malon Reeves===\nIn [[New York City|New York]], [[Michael Asher (Earth-616)|Mikey Asher]] was recruited by [[Fagin (Earth-616)|Fagin]], [[Orwell (Earth-616)|Orwell]], [[Oswald (Brotherhood) (Earth-616)|Oswald]], [[Marabeth (Earth-616)|Marabeth]], after a few meetings, the intervention of the Brotherhood in an incoming firing at Mikey's school and the demonstration of the government felony, having [[Red Cross (Earth-616)|Red Cross]]' staff operating mutant-screening.{{r|Brotherhood #1|3}}\n\nAt some point, the London Cell, comprised of [[Bryson Bale (Earth-616)|Bryson Bale]], [[Tom Morgan (Earth-616)|Bela]], [[Fiona Dunn (Earth-616)|Fiona Dunn]], [[Clive Vickers (Earth-616)|Clive Vickers]] was tasked to abduct and recruit [[Malon Estella Reeves (Earth-616)|Malon Reeves]]. Once done, they intend to took down her father, the secretly mutant [[Malcolm Reeves (Earth-616)|Malcolm Reeves]],'s empire down, because of his anti-mutant engagement. Mikey and Fagin were send to join them. Still, they were followed by Marshall, who torture and seemingly killed Fiona and Bela in order to get intel on X. \n\n===Fall of the Brotherhood===\nThe London Cell fall, as Mikey and Fagin were send away by Bryson, and this one sacrificed himself to kill Malon's father. The last remaining member, Malon was then approached by Marshall,{{r|Brotherhood #4|6}} and was imprisoned with Mikey and Fagin, captured at some point by Marshal.{{r|Brotherhood #7}}\n\nAt the same time, the cells of [[Rome (Italy)|Rome]] and [[Bangkok]] fell too, taken down by the Feds, and rumors started to spread that the Revolution was dying.{{r|Brotherhood #7}} During a rally in [[Philadelphia (Pennsylvania)|Philadelphia]], a massive riot exploded between X's supporters and the police forces.\n\nLater, the Brotherhood Cells of [[Tokyo]], [[Brazil]] and [[North America]] were respectively attacked by [[X-Statix (Earth-616)|X-Force]], the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]]. [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]] himself was taking care of the Brotherhood moles.\n\nMikey, Fagin and Malon were released by Marshal to infiltrate the Brotherhood for him, after having them convinced that X was nothing more than a megalomaniac and selfish person. The three took down [[Jane Smythe (Earth-616)|Dick/Jane Smythe]], a metamorph member of the Brotherhood, on X's orders, as she was giving intel to an enemy faction (who was not Marshal's one, contrary to what X though). They then put her secretly in custody of Marshal's agency, and came back to X, presenting themselves as successful. The team then decide to hit X-Force, as they represented the alliance of some mutants to the system, and choose as target [[Doop (Earth-616)|Doop]], the heart of the team. This action was also in order to send a message to mutankind: Or they were with the Brotherhood, or they were against them.{{r|Brotherhood #8}})\n\n===Brotherhood Last Stand===\nFor this strike, the remaining Cells members were gathered in [[New York City|New York]], where X-Force were acclaimed for their hit on the Tokyo Cell. A fight started between X-Force and the Brotherhood, during which the three traitors were seemingly killed by X-Force, trying to explain themselves. X had Marshall captured but this one revealed his plan, and so the last traitor, [[Orwell (Earth-616)|Orwell]], revealed himself as well. By hearing Marshal's plan, who intended to rally to himself a healthier Brotherhood with him as the leader X, Hoffman fire his powers, but hit Orwell.\n\nMikey Asher, fatally wounded by X-Force, manage to create a trail with his explosive blood, and killed the two former friends and wannabe-leaders of the Revolution.\n\nAs the [[Guy Smith (Earth-616)|Orphan]] asked what was just happened there, [[Edith Sawyer (Earth-616)|U-Go-Girl]] answered it was the end of the Revolution, and after a silence, X-Force left the devastated street.{{r|Brotherhood #9}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
