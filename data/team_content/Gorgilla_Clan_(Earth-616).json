Despite these technological boons, the Gorgillas were still defeated by Iron Fist.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 13}}\n| Equipment               = Formerly the [[Power Stone]]{{r|Avengers Vol 8 13}}\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Gorgillas]]"
