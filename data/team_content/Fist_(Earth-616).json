After they defeated him, one of the Fist's leaders, [[Atropos (Earth-616)|Aisa]], arrived in New York in an advance aircraft and unleashed a remote-controlled tank upon the heroes while she snatched Qweeg. She then convinced him to join their cause.{{r|Spider-Man 2099 Vol 3 5}}\n\nThe Fist next searched for [[Rhonda Fleming (Earth-616)|Glorianna]], a newly manifested [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] with god-like powers, who had gone into self-imposed exile in the [[Rocky Mountains]] after unsuccessfully attempting to force humanity to worship her. Aisa and Qweeg found her in [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]] and recruited her to their organization as well.{{r|Spider-Man 2099 Vol 3 9}}\n\nThe Fist then stole the remains of Dr. Cronos from [[Queens]], and Miguel [[Spider-Tracer-Tracker|tracked]] them to [[Denver]], where [[Sonny Frisco|Dr. Sonny Frisco]] was working on a temporal portal. The terrorist organization hoped to have Glorianna use her powers to stabilize the device and allow them to recover operatives after they'd been sent to unknown points in time. Miguel tried to interfere, but was transported in time by the portal.{{r|Spider-Man 2099 Vol 3 10}} After perfecting the machine, they sent Qweeg to [[Earth-TRN590|yet another dystopian 2099]], a reality were [[Fist (Earth-TRN590)|the Fist]] succeeded in destroying the country, his mission being to find new recruits. There, he encountered the [[Sinister Six (Earth-TRN590)|Sinister Six]], who ruled the dystopian New York, and offered them to join the Fist.{{r|Spider-Man 2099 Vol 3 12}} After Miguel returned to the present, he, Captain America and [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]], an assassin with history with the Hand, went to confront the Fist in their Denver headquarters. The Fist had already evacuated and left Frisco, who was brainwashed into joining them, to keep an eye on the place. After the heroes defeated Frisco, the Fist detonated their Denver base. {{r|Spider-Man 2099 Vol 3 17}}\n\nThe Fist soon began their second wave of attacks on America, broadcasting a message on television describing their anarchist ideology and their belief that the country had failed to live up to the ideals that it was founded on. They sent their agent [[Medea (Olympian) (Earth-616)|Medea]], an Ancient Greek witch, to Chicago. She cursed various people on an environmental expo, transforming them into monsters to attack the city.{{r|Spider-Man 2099 Vol 3 18}} The monsters were kept within [[McCormick Place]] by Captain America, Elektra, and Spider-Man; with Elektra ending the curse by killing Medea.{{r|Spider-Man 2099 Vol 3 19}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
