They also would engage in direct thefts and hold-ups, leading to a direct conflict with Power Man and Spider-Man when the Rat Pack invaded a dance club the two heroes just happened to be visiting in their civilian identities.  The duo later tracked the Rat Pack back to a building whose cellar they were using as their hideout.  In trying to harm Power Man, they accidentally set their own building ablaze, whose other occupants Spider-Man rescued while Power Man captured the arsonists.\n\n| Equipment               = Conventional weapons\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
