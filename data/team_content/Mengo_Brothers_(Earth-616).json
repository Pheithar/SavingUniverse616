The doctor mysteriously vanished when the duo were boys, and as adults they found work as bounty hunters.\n\nSomehow, they became affiliated with a superhuman crimelord and slaver known as The Pig. Under his employ, they found themselves facing the mutant thief known as Gambit. They clashed with him on numerous occasions. However, after The Pig's death, they also helped him break into Castle Doom, when Gambit needed to use Doom's time machine.\n\nAs a result of this caper, they encountered their father, who it turned out had been driven mad and had control of a device which potentially threatened reality. They stranded him in an environment he could not control.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = *At the time of their creation, the Mengo Brothers physically resembled the filmmakers [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wachowskis Larry & Andy Wachowski].
