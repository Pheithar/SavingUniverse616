The Assassins Guild's main rival was the [[Thieves Guild (Earth-616)|Thieves Guild]]. \n\nTo bring peace in the two bands, [[Marius Boudreaux (Earth-616)|Marius Boudreaux]] agreed to marry his daughter [[Bella Donna Boudreaux (Earth-616)|Belladonna]] to the Thieves Guild's [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]]. Their wedding however was interrupted by Belladonna's brother [[Julien Boudreaux (Earth-616)|Julien]] who felt Remy was unworthy of his sister's hand. Julien challenged Gambit to battle, but lost. Remy was banished as punishment for injuring a member of the Guild and abandoned Belladonna. The Guild itself however remained unified.\n\n===Encounter with [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]]===\nThe guild remained relatively silent for some time, keeping to their own business, until they came into a conflict of interests with the rival assassin organization the [[The Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]]. Both sides had operated in the West Coast and laundered a substantial amount of money through the [[San Francisco]] area. With each side eager to be the dominant racket a fued began. \n\nThe Guild sought out X-Man [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] to take advantage of her luck powers and tactical expertise, all while hiding their true identities and agenda. Domino, needing the money, was eager to co-operate until she learned of the business the two clans were fighting over - under-age sex trafficking. Leaving all the assassins to their battles, she snuck away and placed the kidnapped girls into secure care and secretly stole a truck containing all of the money made from their suffering. Believing she had gotten away scott-free, her home was then attacked by the Guild who savagely injured her, giving her mere hours to return the stolen money.\n\nAt this point Domino was reluctantly forced to ask [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] for help, neglecting to inform him of the stolen money at first. Through the combined efforts of [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]], the Guild was out-gunned and outfought with Wolverine convincing/threatening Belladonna to remove the hit on Domino.\n\n===The Return of Candra===\nThe Guilds seemingly separated and, years after her death, [[Candra (Earth-616)|Candra]] returned, as her psyche managed to augment her remaining power and slowly pulled back the pieces of her body back together. The process was hastened by tributes from the Guild.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 19}}\n\nThe Guild eventually encountered [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]] when they were sent to kill his friend [[Donald Meland (Earth-616)|Dr. Donald Meland]]. Scarlet Spider was recognised by the Assassins as Kaine, with whom they had issues to settle with as he had previously killed on their territory.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 3}} Kaine was permitted to live as long as he promised to kill someone for Belladonna at a later date.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 4}}\n\nMonths later, the Belladonna sent Kaine to kill [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 17}} Scarlet Spider managed to ally with Wolverine and they teamed-up in order to stop the Guild. When they arrived at New Orleans, it was revealed to them that Belladonna was following the orders of Candra,{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 18}} who tried to get the essences of Scarlet Spider and Wolverine to finally return entirely. The two heroes managed to convince some Guild members to help them to stop Candra. She was finally killed when Scarlet Spider stung her head, although Belladonna claimed she would find a way to return. When Belladonna was about to order her men to kill Kaine and Wolverine, [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]]'s Arranger showed up and revealed to her the Assassins Guild's assets were now under his boss's control.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 19}}\n\n===Confronting Deadpool===\nWhile chasing down named a target named [[Charles Helder (Earth-616)|Charles Helder]], several of the Assassins Guild's mercenaries were murdered by [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], who had been hired to protect Helder. Deadpool ended up killing Helder himself after learning that he was a nefarious businessman responsible for the death of children.{{r|Deadpool: Assassin Vol 1 2}} Belladonna sent agents after Deadpool, including [[Melody Jacobs (Earth-616)|Threnody]] and [[Blackout (Lilin) (Earth-616)|Blackout]], but he evaded them and Threnody even left the Assassins Guild to join him. Deadpool infiltrated the Guildhouse, and confronted Belladonna, but offered her to work together.{{r|Deadpool: Assassin Vol 1 3}} Belladonna instead decided to keep retaliating against Deadpool, and sent agents after his handler, [[Jack Hammer (Earth-616)|Weasel]].{{r|Deadpool: Assassin Vol 1 4}} After saving Weasel, Deadpool raided the Guildhouse, and managed to single-handedly take down the Assassins Guild's best killers. Belladonna tried to back down on refusing Deadpool's agreement, but he impaled her with a katana, killing her.{{r|Deadpool: Assassin Vol 1 5}}\n \n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * The Assassins Guild is an organization with hundreds of members.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 4}}\n\n* During the confrontation with X-Force, it was revealed the following villains were all members or hired operatives for the guild:\n** [[Douglas Scott (Earth-616)|Razor Fist]] - injured\n** [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]] - injured\n** [[Tanya Sealy (Earth-616)|Black Mamba]] - injured\n** [[Buck Cashman (Earth-616)|Bullet]] - apparently killed\n** [[Carl Burbank (Earth-616)|Bushwacker]] - apparently killed\n** [[Nakh (Earth-616)|Nakh]] - apparently killed\n** [[Clay (Earth-616)|Clay]] - killed\n\n* During their dealings with [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]], the Guild's agents consisted of:\n** [[Smithy (Earth-616)|Smithy]] - killed\n** [[Harvester (Assassin) (Earth-616)|Harvester]] - apparently killed\n** [[Flower (Assassin) (Earth-616)|Flower]]\n** An Undead [[Hand]] ninja\n\n* The following were operatives during the hunt for [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]] and [[Cape Crow (Earth-616)|Cape Crow]] under the leadership of an unnamed telepathic child:{{r|Elektra Vol 4}}\n** [[John Greycrow (Earth-616)|Scalphunter]]\n** [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]]\n** [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]]\n** [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]]\n** [[Maki Matsumoto (Earth-616)|Lady Bullseye]]\n** [[Gregory Bryan (Earth-616)|Sidewinder]]\n** [[Blanche Sitznski (Earth-616)|Anaconda]]\n** [[Tanya Sealy (Earth-616)|Black Mamba]]\n** [[Theodore Scott (Earth-616)|Death Adder]]\n** [[Donald Gill (Earth-616)|Blizzard]]\n** [[Anton Vanko (Whiplash) (Earth-616)|Whiplash]]\n** [[Herman Schultz (Earth-616)|Shocker]]\n** [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]]\n** [[Brock Rumlow (Earth-616)|Crossbones]]\n** [[Jack O'Lantern (Crime-Master's) (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern]]\n** [[Blackout (Lilin) (Earth-616)|Blackout]]\n** [[Todd Arliss (Earth-616)|Tiger Shark]]\n** [[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Whirlwind]]\n** [[Thomas Fireheart (Earth-616)|Puma]]\n\n* Apparently back under the leadership of [[Bella Donna Boudreaux (Earth-616)|Belladonna]], the following Guild members came into conflict with [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]]:{{r|Deadpool: Assassin Vol 1}}\n** [[Melody Jacobs (Earth-616)|Threnody]]\n** [[Nakh (Earth-616)|Nakh]] - killed\n** [[Harvester (Assassin) (Earth-616)|Harvester]] - killed\n** [[Blackout (Lilin) (Earth-616)|Blackout]]\n** [[Carl Burbank (Earth-616)|Bushwacker]]\n** [[Douglas Scott (Earth-616)|Razor Fist]] - killed\n** [[Harkspur Brood (Earth-616)|Harkspur Brood]]\n** [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]]\n** [[KIA (Earth-616)|KIA]] - apparently killed\n** [[Elaine Coll (Earth-616)|Scorpia]] - apparently killed\n** [[Brock Rumlow (Earth-616)|Crossbones]] - apparently killed\n** [[Jack O'Lantern (Crime-Master's) (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern]]\n** [[Lord Deathstrike (Earth-616)|Lord Deathstrike]] - apparently killed\n** [[Mimeyoshi (Earth-616)|Mimeyoshi]] - apparently destroyed\n** [[Tanya Sealy (Earth-616)|Black Mamba]] - apparently killed\n\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Howard Mackie/Creator]]\n[[Category:Lee Weeks/Creator]]\n[[Category:Assassins]]"
