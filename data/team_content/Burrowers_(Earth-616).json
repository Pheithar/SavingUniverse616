This attempt was opposed by both the [[House of Agon (Earth-616)|Inhuman Royal Family]] and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]. The Burrowers were part of an assault on the [[Four Freedoms Plaza]] to recapture Ahura. Both groups ensured that young Ahura remained with is parents instead of being used as a test subject for insidious purposes at the hands of the Council. {{r|Fantastic Four Unlimited #2}}\n\n| Strength                = \n| Weaknesses              = \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
