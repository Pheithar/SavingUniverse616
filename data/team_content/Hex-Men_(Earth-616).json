While the other Hex-Men were teleported with her, Bloodstorm remained behind, presumably due to her betrayal severing any bonds she had with Pryor. She was then\u00a0offered a spot on the team by [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]].{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 12}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
