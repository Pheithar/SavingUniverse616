Suncorp's soldiers arrived instants later (seemingly confused for the Army), inflicting upon Storm their anti-mutant bigotry. They then helped the inhabitants.<!-- {{r|Storm Vol 3 1}} -->\n\nSoon, they returned as Storm did, to expel the inhabitants and take the land for a resort. A fight soon broke with Storm, who defeated the platoon and delivered them to local authorities, prompting [[Emilio Duarte (Earth-616)|President Duarte]] to swore to investigate. Expelled fishermen all along the northern shore soon kicked out Suncorp guards and reclaimed their villages.{{r|Storm Vol 3 1}}\n\nThe foiling of Suncorp's resort project destroyed a seventy-three million dollar annual revenue stream to [[Davis Harmon (Earth-616)|Davis Harmon]], who decided to target Storm.{{r|Storm Vol 3 8}}\n| Equipment               = Bullet-proofs vests, knee-pads{{r|Storm Vol 3 1}}\n| Transportation          = Armored and light vehicles{{r|Storm Vol 3 1}}\n| Weapons                 = Rifles and guns{{r|Storm Vol 3 1}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
