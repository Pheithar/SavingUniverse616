Their leader was the Scientist Supreme, [[Christopher Ganyrog  (Earth-616)|Christopher Ganyrog]], and they often did battle with their former Scientist Supreme, [[Yandroth (Earth-616)|Yandroth]]. When volcanic upheavals imperiled Yannians, Ganyrog lead his team on a rescue mission, only to encounter the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] who had been transported to Yann. The two teams realized their common enemy in Yandroth and the threat he represented to both their planets. Bringing the full might of the Masters, the team transported to Earth to \"run interference\" between the heroes of Earth (whose actions might unwittingly cause the destruction of the planet) and Yandroth's schemes. The plan succeeded and Yandroth was taken back to Yann for trial.{{r|The Order Vol 1 5|6}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/mastersmentalarts.htm Marvel Appendix entry]\n}}\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]"
