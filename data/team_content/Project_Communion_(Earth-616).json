S.H.I.E.L.D. deployed [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Clint Barton]] and [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Kate Bishop]] at the Antarctic Hydra base where the children were being kept to take possession of Project Communion.\n\nDuring the mission, Bishop discovered Project Communion wasn't a weapon but innocent children.{{r|All-New Hawkeye Vol 1 1}} The children were freed and later handed over to S.H.I.E.L.D..{{r|All-New Hawkeye Vol 1 2}} Kate and Clint feared that what S.H.I.E.L.D. would want with the kids could not better than what Hydra was using them for, specially after S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] revealed that she had her hands tied to interfere with the orders she was following. Hill hinted that even though she couldn't do anything Clint and Kate could retrieve the children themselves.\n\nThe two Hawkeyes proceeded to locate and free the children. They subsequently stole a [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Flying Car|flying car]] and took the kids to [[Clint Barton's Apartment Building|Barton's apartment building]] in [[Brooklyn]], where they took it upon themselves to keep the kids safe.{{r|All-New Hawkeye Vol 1 3}}\n\nHydra quickly tracked down the kids, and launched an attack on the apartment building. In order to protect their new guardians, the kids unleashed their destructive powers, killing the Hydra soldiers standing before them.{{r|All-New Hawkeye Vol 1 4}} This course of action caused Clint to question if they were truly safe with the kids. Kate and Clint argued over the kids, and Kate was ultimately forced to bitterly hand them over to Hydra when reinforcements arrived.{{r|All-New Hawkeye Vol 1 4}}\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D. retrieved the kids and placed them in a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility in Colorado. However, the building was raided by Hydra agents and the kids fell back under their control.\n\nClint Barton was joined by a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to retrieve Project Communion from transport.{{r|All-New Hawkeye Vol 2 4}} Kate Bishop and Barton's brother [[Charles Barton (Earth-616)|Barney]] had infiltrated Hydra and moved the children from the main transport to one of the escort vehicles. In the middle of the retrieval operation, Barton shot an arrow at the main vehicle, causing it to derail,  crash and explode, successfully making it appear as if the kids had perished in that accident. While Maria Hill realized Barton had been up to something, she let it slide. Kate, Barney and the kids later met up with Clint to return home.{{r|All-New Hawkeye Vol 2 5}}\n\nAfter a brief fight against Hydra agents who had tracked them down, Clint, Barney and Kate managed to bring Project Communion to Barney's private island, so they could be safe and protected.{{r|All-New Hawkeye Vol 2 6}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Humans (Homo sapiens)]]\n[[Category:Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)]]\n[[Category:Human/Inhuman Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Terrigen Bomb Activations]]\n[[Category:Terrigenesis]]\n[[Category:Mutates]]\n[[Category:Hydra Projects]]\n[[Category:Americans]]"
