Unfortunately, like Franklin's own world, there were those who were driven by racial purity that would go to extreme and radical forms of terrorism to accomplish their own goals: One such group was known as the World Party.\n\nThe World Party started off as a grass roots political group and became a major world power. It has its origins at the close of World War II, Hitler had died and his two super-operatives [[Master Man (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Master Man]] and [[Johann Shmidt (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] went into hiding. Over the convening years, they amassed enough money and influence to start the World Party, a political group that had a thinly veiled racist organization that supported white supremacy and the Nazi ideal. They stationed themselves in Philadelphia, rallying disenfranchised youth and indoctrinating them into the World Party's white supremacist ideals. The group also trained an elite group of soldiers as another costumed operative [[Brock Rumlow (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Crossbones]]. Lastly, they also collected a cache of nuclear missiles which they planned to launch all over the United States in an attempt to ethnically cleanse the country of all the World Party considered impure.\n\nFor unknown reasons, the group also sought out to collect the shield owned by [[Steve Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], which had been in the safe keeping of [[Abraham Wilson (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Abraham Wilson]] who was attempting to reactivate Captain America himself during a period when Roger was programmed to believe that he was a simple construction worker. \n\nIn recent history, the group recruit [[John Barnes (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|John Barnes]], the older brother of [[Rebecca Barnes (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Rebecca \"Rikki\" Barns]] and grandson of [[Richard Barnes (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Richard Barns]] who was Captain America's sidekick Bucky in World War II.\n\nUltimately, [[Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|SHIELD]], Captain America, [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Sam \"Falcon\" Wilson]], and Rikki Barnes (now the costumed heroine Bucky) foiled Master Man and Red Skull's plot, stopping their plot of nuclear Armageddon. Master Man was taken into SHIELD custody, and the Red Skull escaped.{{r|Captain America Vol 2 1}}{{r|Captain America Vol 2 5}}\n\nThe fate of Red Skull and John Barnes remains unrevealed, however when Counter-Earth was destabilized by the [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|Dreaming Celestial]], Master Man escaped from SHIELD custody, denounced his Nazi ways, and picked up a new obsession: Christianity and took over the western United States. Crossbones, horribly mutated by Gamma Radiation, joined Master Man's group and was killed by [[Conner O'Reilly (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Rebel O'Reilly]].{{r|Heroes Reborn: Rebel Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe World Party endured and took over Germany, and mutated [[Ishmael Questor (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Ishmael Questor]] into the powerful telepath IQ. IQ worked with the [[Young Allies (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Young Allies]], and with their aid erased all knowledge of IQ's existence from the German authorities.{{r|Heroes Reborn: Young Allies Vol 1 1}}\n\nWhen Dr. Doom abandoned his leadership of Counter-Earth, the World Party took control rather quickly, however they were ultimately defeated by the combined efforts of the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] and Young Allies.{{Citation}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = The World Party bears a loose semblance to the real life [[Wikipedia:World Union of National Socialists|World Union of National Socialists]].\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Heroes Reborn (1996 Event)]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
