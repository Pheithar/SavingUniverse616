Four of the best soldiers in the [[Latverian Army (Earth-616)|Latverian Army]]{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}} were provided with high-tech armors, designed by Doom himself \"to defeat the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].\"{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}} Only one Doom Squad was formed, with supposedly fearless troopers who were trained and familiarized with the armors. They were even known in Latveria.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe armors were first used in Doom's [[Adirondack Mountains]] [[Castle Doom (Upstate New York)|castle]], [[New York (State)|New York State]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}} under the command of a [[Doombot]] they believed to be Doom himself.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 258}} The [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] were infiltrating the castle supposedly to release a prisoner; but the Doombot, expecting this, emptied the cell and alerted the Squad. The Squad fought against [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]], and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}}\n\n[[File:Doom Squad (Earth-616) from Machines of Doom Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|Doom Squad member.]]\nUnder the leadership of Angel, the X-Men's teamwork was enough to defeat the less-resourceful Squad: The Angel was entangled by a Squad member, but he flew away so that the armored warrior was as imprisoned as he was, giving Wolverine a chance to rip away his armor. Another Squad member trapped Nightcrawler in his net, but Nightcrawler tricked this man and his partner to shoot each other while he teleported away.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}} The last survivor, aghast, decided to retreat,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}} but the Doombot noticed that and decided to punish him.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}}\n\nThe armors were never tested against the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], as was intended.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = The armor provides the Squad with protection against attacks{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}} - although not enough to withstand [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s [[Adamantium]] claws{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}} - and also different powers:{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}}\n* '''Infrared Scanners:''' Can detect heat sources in line of sight.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}\n* '''Grappling Lines:''' Can shoot six steel wires from holes in the breast plate, to grapple an enemy.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}}\n* '''Force lightnings:''' Each arm of the armor ends in a steel ball that can shoot a very powerful lightning.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}} The bolt can also be shot from their chests.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}}\n* '''Asbestos Net:''' Can shoot an asbestos net from the breast plate,{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}} specially effective against fire attacks.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}\n* '''Flight:''' Jets in the boots allow them to fly, although at a very low speed.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}}\n'''Known Abilities:''' <br> \n* Military experience.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}\n* Martial arts, including boxing.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}\n'''Strength Level:''' <br> \n* With the armor, the Doom Squad had almost superhuman strength.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 145}}\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Latverians]]\n[[Category:Latverian Organizations]]"
