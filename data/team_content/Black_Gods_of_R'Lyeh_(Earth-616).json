[[R'lyeh (City)|R'lyeh]] was created by [[Howard Phillips Lovecraft|H.P. Lovecraft]] in \"Call of Cthulhu\" (''Weird Tales''; June, 1928).\n** It is possible that the Black Gods of R'lyeh, instead of being a subset of the [[Great Old Ones|Great]] or [[Lesser Old Ones]], were originally meant simply as a synonyms for the Great Old Ones<!-- invoked once without much context -->, but were considered a proper group by the <!--Appendix? and -->Official Handbooks writer after being invoked alongside the Old Ones and other entities in \"The Web Tightens\" ({{cl|Conan the Barbarian #141}}; December, 1982).\n* The \"Black Gods\" of the [[Pre-Cataclysmic Age]] were mentioned by Robert E. Howard in \"[[The Curse of the Golden Skull]]\"{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #14|; A Kull Glossary: Black Gods' profile}} (1928), adapted in {{cl|Conan the Barbarian #37}} (April, 1974). The Black Gods aren't mentioned in that adaptation.\n** \"Black Gods\" were mentioned in {{cl|Kull the Destroyer #18}}, {{cl|Kull the Destroyer #21|#21}}, {{cl|Kull the Destroyer #24|#24}}, and {{cl|Kull the Destroyer #26|#26}} (December, 1976 to April, 1978).\n* It is unknown if the [[Thing from R'lyeh (Earth-616)|Thing from R'lyeh]], an Old One, was part of the [[Black Gods of R'Lyeh]], Old Ones (Lesser or Great) as well.\n| Trivia                  = * R'lyeh was originally wrote with a \"l\" minuscule letter. In comics, it is unknown how it is written (due to bubble texts being written exclusively in capital letters), but in the [[Demons]]' profile of {{cl|Marvel Zombies: The Book of Angels, Demons & Various Monstrosities #1|Marvel Zombies: The Book of Angels, Demons & Various Monstrosities}}, it is written \"R'Lyeh\", with a capital \"L\".\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Deities]]\n[[Category:Cthulhu Mythos Races, Species and Groups]]\n[[Category:Great Old Ones]]\n[[Category:Lesser Old Ones]]\n[[Category:Pre-Cataclysmic Age Characters]]\n[[Category:Pre-Cataclysmic Age Deities]]\n[[Category:Hyborian Age Characters]]\n[[Category:Hyborian Age Deities]]\n[[Category:Literary Characters]]\n[[Category:Black Gods]]"
