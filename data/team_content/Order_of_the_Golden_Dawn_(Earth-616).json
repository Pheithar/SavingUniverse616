He brought various secret societies and cults into one single organization dedicated to bringing about a new world order. It consisted of the [[Celestial Order of the Si-Fan (Earth-616)|Celestial Order of the Si-Fan]] ([[China]]), the [[Twenty-Third Sect (Earth-616)|Twenty-Third Sect]], the [[Leopard Cults (Earth-616)|Leopard Cult]] ([[Africa]]), the [[Phansigars (Earth-616)|Phansigars]]/[[Thugees (Earth-616)|Thugees]] ([[India]]), the [[Knights Templar (Earth-616)|Knights Templar]] ([[Europe]]), the [[Hashishin (Earth-616)|Hashishin]] ([[Middle East]]), the [[Left-Hand Path (Earth-616)|Left-Hand Path]] ([[:Category:Satanism|satanic cult]]), the [[Three-Cornered Sight (Earth-616)|Three-Cornered Sight]], and the [[Light-Seekers (Earth-616)|Light-Seekers]].{{r|Master of Kung Fu #83}} When [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]] and his allies invaded the temple, they were attacked by representatives of several of these groups.{{r|Master of Kung Fu #85}}\n\nDuring Fu Manchu's plan to bring about World War III, he sent the Phansigars and Si-Fan to prevent his son [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]] and the [[MI6 (Earth-616)|MI6]] from interfering which they failed to achieve.{{r|Master of Kung Fu #88}} Later, when Shang-Chi and his associates invaded Fu Manchu's fortress in [[Henan|Honan]], [[China]], they were confronted by the Si-Fan, Knights Templar, Leopard Cultists, Phansigars, and Hashishin whom attempted to defend the fortress.{{r|Master of Kung Fu #118}}\n\nIt was later revealed by [[Zheng Shi-Hua (Earth-616)|Shi-Hua]] that the Golden Dawn, along with the [[Celestial Order of the Si-Fan (Earth-616)|Order of the Si-Fan]] and [[Celestial Order of the Hai-Dai (Earth-616)|Order of the Hai-Dai]] were aliases used for the [[Five Weapons Society (Earth-616)|Five Weapons Society]], much like how Fu Manchu was an alias for Zheng Zu.{{r|Shang-Chi Vol 1 2}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n\n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:International Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Five Weapons Society]]"
