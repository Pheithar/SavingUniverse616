Marc Stone]] to capture super criminals. In their first mission there was a fire in an apartment and a hostage situation. [[Andrew Jackson (Jock) (Earth-616)|Jock Jackson]], a member of Code: Blue, distracted the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]] to save the hostage. They captured more dangerous criminals and they had excellent tactics and leadership. But one day Code: Blue couldn't help [[Thunderstrike]] in combat against [[Pandara]] and a member, Jock Jackson, sacrificed his life to save him.\n\nThey sometimes helped [[Spider-Man]] when he was in danger and fought the [[Beetle]], [[Cadre]], and [[Scorpion]].\n\n|Equipment                = Anti-bullet vests, infrared glasses, helmets, gadgets\n                  \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Heavy machine guns, various type of guns, bombs, rocket launchers\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n* http://www.marvel.com/universe/Code:_Blue\n* http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/codeblue.htm\n}}\n[[Category:Government Organizations]]"
