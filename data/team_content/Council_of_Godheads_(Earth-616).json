Over several years after the Hyborian Age, which occurred roughly after the sinking of the continent of [[Atlantis]] and before the advent of written records, the Gods of Earth divided into certain groups or tribes called pantheons, mostly designated to areas on Earth with mortals who were separated culturally, geographically or racially. Each pantheon allowed themselves to be worshipped as gods either willingly or unwillingly by these gatherings of mortals. At times, certain pantheons even came to clash with each other over different reasons, usually over worship rights. Only a few of these confrontations are known. It is known that the [[Olympians]] and the [[Asgardians]] formed an alliance with each other after friction between their perspective pantheons and that the Native American Gods nearly entered into bloodshed with the Asgardians when Vikings started invading North America. More over, the Celtic Gods now have a truce with the Asgardians after years of enmity, but not yet with the Olympians who they have held in low disregard since the Romans invaded Briton.  Similarly, the Mesopotamian Gods finally have a truce with the Olympians after millennia of mistrust, but not with the Devas of the Hindu gods. -->\n===Pre-Cataclysmic Age===\n[[Valka (Earth-616)|Valka]] was one of the first new gods (following the [[Elder Gods of Earth|Elder Gods]]) worshiped on [[Earth]]. He achieve prominence about 30,000 B.C which lasted at least 12,000 years, and was part of the Council of Godheads.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #3|; Council of Godheads}}<!-- or was he part after his prominence? -->\n\n===[[Hyborian Age]]===\nSome [[:Category:Hyborian Age Deities|gods from the Hyborian Age]] were members of the Council, such as [[Crom (Earth-616)|Crom]], [[Dagon (Annunaki) (Earth-616)|Dagon]] or [[Mithra (Earth-616)|Mitra]].{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #3|; Council of Godheads}}\n\n===[[Glossary:Third Host|Third Host]] of the [[Celestials]]===\nFollowing the war between the [[Asgardians]] and the [[Olympians]],{{Citation}} [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] learned of the coming of the [[Glossary:Third Host|Third Host]] of the [[Celestials]], alien beings of inconceivable cosmic power who had influenced the evolution of the Earth\u2019s human race and intended to judge humanity\u2019s worthiness to survive when the [[Glossary:Fourth Host|Fourth Host]] came. Odin had contacted [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus]], ruler of the Olympian gods, and they then met with the ruling gods of Earth\u2019s other pantheons to set a course of action. This would be the first such gathering of the Council. Odin, Zeus, and the [[Daevas|Hindu god]] [[Vishnu (Hindu Deity) (Earth-616)|Vishnu]] then confronted the Third Host, which threatened to seal off the inter-dimensional passages between the gods realms and Earth unless the gods did not interfere with the Celestials\u2019 activities for a millennium. Acting on behalf of Earth\u2019s gods, Odin, Zeus, and Vishnu agreed with their terms, but Odin already began making plans for the Fourth Host, which would arrive about a millennium later. He constructed a suit of armor with nearly invincible powers called the [[Destroyer (Enchanted Armor)|Destroyer]], and transformed the Rhinegold Ring-Halves into the [[Odinsword|Oversword of Asgard]].{{r|Thor #300}} [[Freyja Freyrdottir (Earth-616)|Frigga]] and the other leading goddesses of Earth\u2019s pantheons took charge in finding Earth\u2019s human beings who were as close to genetic perfection as possible over these centuries.<!-- {{r|Thor #301}} -->\n\n===[[Modern Age]]===\n====Fourth Host of the Celestials====\nAfter the coming of the Fourth Host of the Celestials, Odin withdrew all the life essences of the Asgardians except [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] into himself. Then Odin\u2019s spirit entered the Destroyer, animating it, and Odin thus did battle with the Fourth Host. The Celestials annihilated the Destroyer, but judged in humanity\u2019s favor when the Earth goddess [[Gaea (Earth-616)|Gaea]] presented them with twelve genetically advanced human beings, the \u201c[[Young Gods (Earth-616)|Young Gods]].\u201d The chieftains of the other pantheons of Earth granted the power to restore Odin, who then revived the Asgardians.{{r|Thor #301}}\n\n====The God-Eater<!-- unsure on the nesting -->====\nIn later years, the Council has been called together by Zeus, Odin or others to face potential threats. After [[Hades (Earth-616)|Hades]], the Olympian god of the dead, entered into a pact with other gods of the dead to extend their respective reigns, they accidentally succeeded in restoring the primeval entity known as [[Atum (Earth-616)|Demogorge]] the God-Eater to life, which then proceeded in consuming the respective gods which it had confused as demonic beings. Odin then called upon the gods of earth to each send a champion to confront Demogorge who then turned on them as well. Consumed himself,  the thunder-god succeeded in reversing the creature's palate and was able to save himself and the other consumed gods.{{r|Thor Annual #10}}\n\n====Infinity Gauntlet====\nSometime later, Odin and Zeus again gathered the respective sovereigns of the pantheons of earth to discuss the threat that [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] posed with the [[Infinity Gauntlet (Item)|Infinity Gauntlet]], a device with extra-ordinary cosmic power to restructure reality. Previously, the group had met physically in a neutral realm adjacent to their separate worlds, but this time, they met in [[Asgard (Realm)|Asgard]] and were stranded here as Thanos set the realms of the gods off the Celestial Axis. Nevertheless, Thanos was defeated by recurring waves of forces ranging from the costumed champions of Earth, the gods of Earth, and to the cosmic forces of the universe itself.{{Citation}}\n\nOver the years, the chief members of the Council has been unofficially preclusive to the rulers, sovereigns and chiefs of the pantheons of Earth, but this has been by no means absolute. Both [[Brahma (Earth-616)|Brahma]] and [[Shiva (Earth-616)|Shiva]] have attended gatherings with Vishnu while others such as [[Zhao Yen (Earth-616)|Shou-Hsing]] of the Chinese Gods and [[Horus (Deity) (Earth-616)|Horus]] of the Egyptian Gods have stepped in where [[Takamimusubi (Earth-616)|Takamimusubi]] and [[Osiris (Earth-616)|Osiris]] were unable to attend. As a matter of fact, Osiris has taken over the sovereign duties of [[Ammon Ra (Earth-616)|Ammon-Ra]] in his absence now that he has taken the role as ruler of the Egyptian gods. [[Tezcatlipoca (Earth-616)|Tezcatlipoca]], Ruler of the Aztec Gods, has even accompanied [[Itzamna Kauil (Earth-616)|Itzamna]] in meetings, and in one known alternate reality was replaced by [[Quetzalcoatl (Earth-616)|Quetzalcoatl]] himself. After the death of Odin, Thor himself ascended to his father's role in the Council after taking his role as Ruler of the Asgardian Gods although now with the restoration of the Asgardians, Odin is now once more Ruler of Asgard and again part of the Council.{{Citation}}\n\n====[[Secret Invasion]]====\n[[File:Council of Godheads (Earth-616) from Incredible Hercules Vol 1 116 001.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Athena Parthenos (Earth-616)|Athena]] convenes a [[Council of Godheads]] to discuss the impending threat of the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]].]]\nIn their most recent gathering, the Council of Godheads, united by the [[Tiamut (Earth-616)|Dreaming Celestial]] in [[San Francisco]], was called forth by [[Athena Parthenos (Earth-616)|Athena]], the Olympian Goddess of Wisdom, to be told of the impending [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrull]] threat posed by their imminent [[Secret Invasion|invasion]]. Fearing that the shifting of the cosmic axis would replace them with a new pantheon of alien deities and prompt the [[Atum (Earth-616)|Demogorge]] to lay waste to them all, the Earth gods chose to counter this new threat by following Athena's proposed strategy of journeying to the realm of the [[Skrull Pantheon (Earth-616)|Skrull Pantheon]] and eliminating them there, while the remaining heroes of the planet, combined with any of their alien or extradimensional allies, joined forces in hopes of repelling the threat directly through force.{{Citation}}\n\nThe \"[[God Squad (Earth-616)|God Squad]]\" was chosen, comprising of [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], [[Narya (Earth-616)|Snowbird]], [[Ajak (Earth-616)|Ajak]], [[Atum (Earth-616)|Atum]], and [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (Earth-616)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]], as well as boy genius [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus Cho]], mortal companion of Hercules. The Council urged the god-heroes to reach [[Nightmare (Earth-616)|Nightmare]] to attain a map of the route to the Skrull deity world, and though their own souls were nearly lost, Mikaboshi's magical trickery succeeded in fooling Nightmare long enough to find the map with no cost for the God Squad other than their own temporary suffering and more long-lasting mental scars from the traumatic experiences within themselves. Though both the Demogorge and Ajak fell before the might of the Skrull gods before their final confrontation, Hercules, Amadeus and Snowbird survived to return to Earth, while Mikaboshi, thought to be slain by the surviving God Squad, became free of the [[Amatsu-Kami|Kami]] and seized control over the enslaved Skrull deities, upsetting the invasion, as well as damaging war morale for the Skrulls, who no longer possessed their core inspiration for their religious war, all according to Athena's plan.{{Citation}}\n\n====[[Chaos War]]====\n[[File:Council of Godheads (Earth-616) from Chaos War Vol 1 3 001.jpg|left|300px|thumb|[[Amaterasu_(Earth-616)|Amaterasu]] protects the various portals to the Divine Realms inside the [[Council of Godheads]] throne room from an impending attack by Mikaboshi.]]\nMikaboshi, calling himself the Chaos King, then commanded the Skrull deities in an attack on war a few months later, duping Hercules into revealing the secret location of the Council Elite where they held their meetings and then launching an attack there. Leading a swath of destruction to destroy the gods of Earth and absorb their life energies, Mikaboshi was finally destroyed by Thor and with his death, those gods slain by him were mystically restored to life afterward.{{Citation}}\n\n====[[Fear Itself]]====\nSince Mikaboshi's defeat, the Council has once again reconvened to discuss the threat of the Serpent, a self-proclaimed god of fear and his plan to cause chaos on Earth. Advised by Odin, the Council was successful in defeating the Serpent in laying claim on Earth.{{Citation}}\n\n| Equipment               = The Council has access to the combined total resources of all the dozens of Earthly pantheons, including everything found in their native dimensions, which they can use at their disposal if needed.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = Each member of the Council possesses magical and cosmic power on a scale comparable to even the [[Elder Gods of Earth|Elder Gods]]{{citation}} and certain cosmic beings, far dwarfing that of a [[Sorcerer Supreme]]'s might.{{citation}}\n\n| Trivia                  = [[Odin]] moved into the afterlife after the end of the [[Ragnarok|Ragnarok Cycle]] to prevent [[Surtur (Earth-616)|Surtur]] from returning to again attempt to destroy the Earth. It is unknown whether the other members of the Council of Godheads still consider him a member of their gathering.\n| Links                   = * [http://www.marveldirectory.com/groupsandteams/councilofgodheads.htm Council Of Godheads at MarvelDirectory.com]\n}}"
