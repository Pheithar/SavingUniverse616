[[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]], who had come across the Vridai in the past, knew they were innocent and decided to help them defeat the actual criminals. Arriving at the [[Temple of the Three]], they fought their way through the Vridai before coming across their leaders, [[Ophidian (Earth-616)|Count Ophidian]] and [[Birgit (Earth-616)|Legie Knight Birgit]].{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 1}}\n\nAfter tracking the Vridai across the world, they discovered the Count Ophidian they had encountered wasn't, in fact, the real one, as he had been held prisoner by Birgit all this time.{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 3}} Scared of his \"new captors\", Count Ophidian revealed that the Vridai had lost their home after the [[War of the Realms]] and they had nowhere to go, so the team agreed to help \"another wandering soul\".{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 6}}\n\nTheir next stop was [[Staten Island|Monster Island]], where they established a temporary base with [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]]'s consent. After a while there, Spider-Woman, Blade and Winter Soldier found themselves having to fight each other in a bar fight, and after Jess won, she was offered a job offer by [[Don Buggini (Earth-616)|Don Buggini]] to go pro. She didn't put much thought into it, but kept Don Buggini's business card.{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 7}}\n\nWhen leaving the bar, they were ambushed by Birgit, leading Count Ophidian to be kidnapped again. They followed Birgit to [[Svartalfheim]] and managed to return safely to Monster Island alongside Ophidian, but it still wasn't safe for him. Thinking back to her job offer, Jessica called for a ring fight where the team had to confront countless monsters and even each other. The team were ignorant of Jess's plan and were growing impatient after taking on so many opponents, but after a long battle, Spider-Woman managed to knock everyone out and revealed herself to actually be Count Ophidian in disguise, was then declared the winner and offered a job and residence in the Island.{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 7|9}}\n\nAfter having a celebratory dinner, the team briefed the Avengers on everything that happened the past few weeks and parted aways.{{r|Strikeforce Vol 1 9}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
