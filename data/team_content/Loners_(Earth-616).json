Eventually she realized just how dangerous her 'hobby' was, and quit for good, joining her fellow former teen hero Phil Urich,[[Phillip Urich (Earth-616)|Green Goblin]], (the only heroic Green Goblin) as a reporter for the Los Angeles Times.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 1}}\n\nMusashi and Urich conceived ''Excelsior'' as an outreach organization, a 'support group' for teen heroes. Mickey contacted a number of former team heroes, and their first meeting was at a church in [[Los Angeles]] (which was interrupted by a phone call from a 'mysterious benefactor' who offered the team $1 million to hunt down the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]] and \"get them off the streets\".) This story coincided with the Runaways bringing new member [[Victor Mancha (Earth-616)|Victor Mancha]] into the fold, who it was discovered was [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]]'s son. It only took the return of Darkhawk, after a mental breakdown, to defeat Ultron.\n\nThe last the team was seen, their \"mysterious benefactor,\" now revealed to be [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]], had asked them to continue their hero duties as the \"experienced\" team on the West Coast. It was also revealed that Chamber was in fact the reincarnated [[Geoffrey Wilder (Earth-616)|Geoffrey Wilder]], sent by the new [[Pride (Earth-616)|Pride]] to spy on the latest Los Angeles-based team.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 6}}\n\nWhile the group was intended to help each other refrain from using their powers and try live normal daily lives, many of them tended to 'fall off the wagon' and use their powers anyway. Specifically, when Mattie Franklin (Spider-Woman) found out who took her DNA to produce [[Mutant Growth Hormone|MGH]], she enlisted the help of Darkhawk and went to find out more information. Darkhawk, who just wanted to use his powers again, ruined their cover and they ran into a woman named [[Nekra Sinclair (Earth-616)|Nekra Sinclair]] who seemed to be held captive by the MGH producers.{{r|The Loners #2}}\n\nThe Loners continued their original role as a support group of former teen heroes and people with an 'addiction' to the hero life, and helped [[Chris Powell (Earth-616)|Darkhawk]] when he lost control of his armor during his time working for [[Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. (Earth-616)|Project Pegasus]].  [[Chris Powell (Earth-616)|Darkhawk]] eventually left the planet and became involved in the [[War of Kings]].{{r|War of Kings: Darkhawk #2}}\n\nThe known remaining members of the group, (Hollow, Lightspeed, Ricochet, and Turbo) joined the Avengers Academy, once again becoming heroes.{{r|Avengers Academy #22}}\n\n==Excelsior==\n* [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]], saw the group's value due to his own teen sidekick days\n* [[Michiko Musashi (Earth-616)|Turbo]] - (Michiko \"Mickey\" Musashi), used to be a member of the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]]. Turbo decided to abandon her hero identity and concentrate on her education. Michiko retired the Torpedo armor and returned to investigative journalism.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 1}}\n* [[Jonathan Gallo (Earth-616)|Ricochet]] - (Johnny Gallo), was one of the [[Slingers (Earth-616)|Slingers]]. He is a mutant who has an early warning sense much like [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]'s, as well as superhuman agility, targeting skills and coordination.\n* [[Christopher Powell (Earth-616)|Darkhawk]] - (Chris Powell), gave up his powers due to the intense nightmares they caused. Chris Powell has a short-temper which always leads to violence in his Darkhawk form. He not only attacked his enemies at times he attacked his own teammates.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 3}}\n* [[Julie Power (Earth-616)|Lightspeed]] - (Julie Power),  was a member of [[Power Pack (Earth-616)|Power Pack]]. Julie believed that being a member of a superhero team at such a young age robbed her of a childhood. Originally came to California to be a actor.{{r|Runaways Vol 2 1}}\n* [[Geoffrey Wilder (Earth-616)|Geoffrey Wilder]], is a time-displaced enemy of the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]] and leader of the [[Pride (Earth-616)|Pride]]. He joined the team disguised as [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]]. Geoffrey Wilder used the team to gain intelligence on the Runaways. His false identity was hinted at by [[Molly Hayes (Earth-616)|Molly Hayes]] when she asked who he thought he was fooling with his \"fakey accent\".{{r|Runaways Vol 2 3}}\n\nRecruits:\n* [[Martha Franklin (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]] - (Mattie Franklin),  was being exploited to produce [[Mutant Growth Hormone]]. After that event she decided to move  to [[Los Angeles]] to start over and has been going to meetings regularly. Mattie Franklin later turned up in New York City but was captured by [[Anastasia Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Ana Kravinoff]] and killed by [[Aleksandra Nikolaevna (Earth-616)|Sasha Kravinoff]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #635}}\n* [[Hollow (Earth-616)|Hollow]], was the [[Homo superior|mutant]] ward Penance who was a member of [[Generation X (Earth-616)|Generation X]]. It has not been revealed who now resides in this hollow body.{{r|Generation X #58}}\n* [[Red Ronin (UJ1-DX) (Earth-616)|Namie]], a mysterious female character that is eventually outed as a cyborg and the new model for the [[Red Ronin]]; UJ1-XD.{{r|The Loners #6}}\n* [[Phillip Urich (Earth-616)|Green Goblin IV]] - (Phil Urich), the fourth Green Goblin is a hero unlike his predecessors. After losing his costume and equipment , he finished college, earned a degree in journalism, and helped start Excelsior team.
