She associated with [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] for a while, and after his death she had developed ambitions of her own. The crime syndicate was a resource used by her to acquire power. The rank and file consisted of members from various species and were well-armed, possessing artillery that used to belong to the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]]. It was a syndicate that had long memories, and didn't forget betrayals. The outlaw [[Yondu Udonta (Earth-616)|Yondu]]  feared the Bahamut Crime Syndicate.\n\nSkreet hired Yondu to find the Herald's Urn, but because he was late he was told he wouldn't be paid. The [[M'Kraan (Race)|M'Kraan]] arrived, demanding the Herald's Urn. A three-way battle ensued between the Bahamut Crime Syndicate, the M'Kraan, and Yondu (with his descendant the time-displaced [[Yondu Udonta (Earth-691)|Yondu]]. Which was interrupted by the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] who put an end to the fighting by taking nearly all the combatants down, except for Yondu.{{r|Yondu Vol 1 3}}{{r|Yondu Vol 1 5}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
