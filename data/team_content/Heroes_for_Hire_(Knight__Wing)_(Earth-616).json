Initially hesitant, the pair eventually created a team including [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]], [[Buchanan Mitty (Earth-616)|Humbug]], [[Orka (Earth-616)|Orka]], [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]], [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]] and a new [[Maria Vasquez (Earth-616)|Tarantula]].{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 2 #1}} After the murder of [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Goliath]] in battle, they made plans to take on [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America.]]{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 2 #2}}\n\nAfter learning Captain America's location from a Pixiu, the team (minus [[Orka]] and [[Tarantula (Maria Vasquez)|Tarantula]]) tracked him down. While [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty]] and the team just wanted to talk and find a peaceful solution, they were betrayed by [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]]. Paladin disabled the team with knock-out gas and attempted to capture Captain America. [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]]'s martial arts training had allowed him to hold his breath long enough to avoid the effects of the gas. Shang-Chi defeated Paladin and switched his uniform with Captain America. When [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] arrived, Paladin was unintentionally taken into custody.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 2 #3}}\n\nShortly thereafter, Captain America and the Heroes For Hire parted ways, and the [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] abandon their now-compromised base. Meanwhile, the Heroes For Hire discovered a black-market operation that surgically implanted superhumans with Skrull organs that would endow those who had the operation with Skrull-shapeshifting abilities. Several of these hybrid [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrull]]-villains busted Misty Knight's old foe [[Celia Ricadonna (Earth-616)|Ricadonna]] from prison. Ricadonna destroyed the Heroes' headquarters by sending an explosive package, and put hits out on the entire team. Most notable of these were [[Insecticide (Earth-616)|Insecticide]] (the hitman sent to kill [[Humbug]] \u2014 Humbug neutralized him with help from his pet killer bees), [[Shadow Stalker (Earth-616)|Shadowstalker]] (an old foe of Shang Chi sent to kill him--Shang Chi quickly humiliated him), and the gang of ninjas that attacked [[Maria Vasquez (Earth-616)|Tarantula]] when she was with her father. After they murdered her father, Tarantula killed the entire gang herself. The team split up in search of Ricadonna \u2014 while Misty Knight and [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]] tried to shake up the Toddler for information, Humbug used his flies to discover Ricadonna's base--and also that she had somehow gained superpowers. This led to a fight against Ricadonna who's Skrull organ business they stopped and who they believed they had killed.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 2 3|5}}\n\nHeroes For Hire were then paid to locate and put a stop to the [[Death Cadre (Earth-616)|Death Cadre]], a dangerous group of thieves who had been using advanced exoskeletons to aid in their robberies, with no regard for the collateral damage or death they left in their wake. The investigation led them to stop a plot to destroy the [[Statue of Liberty]] as part of a plan by [[Eric Williams (Earth-616)|Grim Reaper]] to set himself up as an untraceable terrorist for hire. While they were on this investigation Humbug was held captive by the [[Headmen (Earth-616)|Headmen]], when some of the team arrived to rescue them Orka was killed by a Doombot.{{r|Heroes For Hire Vol 2 6|8}}\n\nThe team disbanded after the events of [[World War Hulk]] resulted in the death of Humbug, and with many members leaving due to conflicting opinions on how the team should work.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 2 11|15}}\n\nAfter being kidnapped and held prisoner by [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]]{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 3 #1}} following a false pregnancy{{r|I Am an Avenger #1}}, Misty was forced to act as a liaison for a new, loose-knit Heroes for Hire, employing [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]], [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]], [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]], [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sable]], and [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] in various missions to stop a drug cartel pushing the [[Atlanteans|Atlantean]]-manufactured drug [[Hook (Drug)|Hook]], before being rescued by [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]] and ex-boyfriend [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]].{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 3 #5}} Following her release, she and Paladin officially restarted Heroes for Hire, briefly employing [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] in their first mission against [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc]] and his [[Batroc's Brigade (Earth-616)|Brigade]].{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 3 6}}\n{{Clear}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each teammates' arsenal\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  =\n| Links                   = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_for_Hire\n}}\n[[Category:Detective Agencies]]"
