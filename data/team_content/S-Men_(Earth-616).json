Red Skull recruited servants and enhanced them using mad science and magical artifacts, creating the S-Men, with the main objective to protect humanity by destroying mutantkind.\n\nTheir first recorded mission was the retrieval of Professor X's corpse from his mausoleum so Red Skull would fuse part of his brain with his in order to gain powerful telepathic powers. They detonated an explosion at the mausoleum to temporarily conceal the theft.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #1}}\n\nTheir second was precipitating the Red Riot where close to a hundred people lost their lives either at the hands of the S-Men or the rioting caused by their leader's nascent telepathy.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #3}}{{r|Uncanny Avengers #4}}{{r|Uncanny Avengers #7}}\n\nIn the months that followed they would try to recruit [[Jet Zola (Earth-616)|Jet Black]]{{r|Captain America Vol 7 16.NOW}} to their cause and would be sent out into the world by the Red Skull on their third recorded mission to capture mutants, Inhumans, and members of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]].{{r|Captain America Vol 7 22}}{{r|Magneto Vol 3 9}}\n\n===March to AXIS===\nMost of the S-Men were killed by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] when he infiltrated [[Genosha]] soon after the Red Skull turned it into a mutant concentration camp. The only surviving members were [[Honest John (Earth-616)|Honest John]], the [[Dangerous Jinn (Earth-616)|Dangerous Jinn]], and the nameless monk.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #25}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Formally [[Dancing Water (Earth-616)|Dancing Water]]'s aquatic teleportation.\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The S-Men are named after their founder's surname Shmidt which is the Red Skull's real surname.

Their leader The Red Skull combined Xavier's brain with his own in a similar manner to the [[U-Men]], though through the expertise of his partner [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=43969 Remender Plans an Apocalyptic Future for the \"Uncanny Avengers\"]</ref>\n| Links                   = \n}}"
