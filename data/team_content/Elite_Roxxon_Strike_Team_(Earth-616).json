Once they drank the dragon's blood, the members of the Roxxon Elite Strike Force were turned into hideous and enraged giant creatures.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 7}}\n\nSome time later, when Agger was kidnapped by [[Oubliette Midas (Earth-616)|Exterminatrix]] and [[Shingen Harada II (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]],{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 8}} the Elite Roxxon Strike Team was deployed to rescue their boss.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 9}} However, as they prepared themselves to go into battle, their boss' kidnappers invaded [[Roxxon Island]] and sent their [[Mindless Ones]] to attack them once they were confronted. All of them were eventually knocked out by [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Thor]].{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 10}}\n\nA B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R. was later dispatched as security into a [[New York City]] implantation of Roxxon. There, he tried to stop the [[Clayton Cole (Earth-616)|Clash]] and his [[Vox Populi (Earth-616)|Vox Populi]] from stealing the place. As Clash's henchmen distributed stolen jewels among the civilians nearby, the B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R. attacked them, forcing [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] to intervene. As he discovered a facility turning stray animals into living weapons, the B.E.R.S.E.R.K.E.R. try to crush him from behind, only to miss him and destroy the facility.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 25}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Most any manner of range semi to full-auto firearms.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Private Military Companies]]\n[[Category:Roxxon Projects]]"
