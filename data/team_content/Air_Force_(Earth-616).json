They were led by Cardinal. In their first mission they freed Cardinal from jail{{R|New Warriors Vol 1 35}} so he could get revenge on the New Warriors for an earlier defeat.{{R|New Warriors Vol 1 28}} They were defeated by Nova and Turbo. This first mission was the only mission that included Killer Shrike.\n\nLater the group tried to hijack a Taylor Foundation jet but were defeated by Night Thrasher who threatened to turn off their armors over the ocean if they did not deliver relief aid to Africa.{{R|Night Thrasher Vol 1 5}} By this time Oriole had replaced Killer Shrike as a member.\n\nWhile fulfilling their bargain with Night Thrasher in Africa Tanager and Oriole were killed by the Soldiers of Misfortune operatives of the Undertow.{{R|New Warriors Vol 1 54}} Their teammate Sparrow was enslaved by the Undertow and presumably is still their operative.\n\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = This team shouldn't be confused with the [[United States Air Force (Earth-616)|US Air Force]], part of the [[United States of America|USA]]'s military system, or from any other \"Air Force\" military corps.\n| Trivia                  = An artist mistake shows Killer Shrike as being dead instead of Oriole in New Warriors Vol 1 54.\n| Links                   = \n}}"
