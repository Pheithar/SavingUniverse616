To this end, they hired the services of [[Blake Schiel (Earth-616)|Animax]] and [[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Mole Man]], who caused situations in [[Salt Lake City]] that required the intervention of Kid Kaiju and his monsters so the Intelligencia could gather information.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 3 1}} Even though he was only meant to test Kid Kaiju's abilities, the Mole Man betrayed his benefactors and kidnapped the boy from [[Corpus Christi]], hoping his powers could be used to resurrect the deceased [[Deviant Mutates (Deviant Experiments)|Deviant Mutates]]. Because of this, the New Intelligencia hired [[Marguerite Hellbender (Earth-616)|Lady Hellbender]] to bring Kid Kaiju to their base.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 3 2}}\n\nWhen Kei refused to concede to the New Intelligencia's demands, the villains sent a group of giant monsters to attack his home in [[Mu (Monster Island)|Mu]]. Luckily for Kid Kaiju, his guardian, [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]], came to his aid after allying herself with Mole Man. Kei and his allies then teleported away to Mu via [[Mordred's Causeway]] to protect his home.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 3 4}} In order to keep the New Intelligencia from interfering, Bloodstone commanded the Mole Man's [[Moloids]] to swarm their base. By the time the [[Samuel Sterns (Earth-616)|Leader]] subdued the creatures using his mental powers, Kei and his monsters had already won the fight, and teleported back to the New Intelligencia's base. Following their subsequent defeat, the New Intelligencia were arrested by [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum-Dum Dugan]] and placed in [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody;{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 3 5}} however, they soon escaped [[Ryker's Island|Ryker's Island Maximum Security Penitentiary]] during a massive prison break and were later tracked down by the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 593}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Think Tanks]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
