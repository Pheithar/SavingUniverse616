Particularly, they wished revenge upon [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] and [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] for an incident years earlier. The duo had spearheaded a self-appointed group of Earth heroes (the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|\"Illuminati\"]]) that traveled to [[Tarnax IV]] and let it be known that if future incursions persisted, the Skrulls would face swift and direct consequences.{{r|New Avengers: Illuminati #1}} Naturally, the Skrulls didn't took too kindly to this \"affront\" on their doorstep and scheming ensued.{{r|New Avengers #42}}\n<!-- \n===[[Secret Invasion]]===\n... -->\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Skrull Organizations]]\n[[Category:Skrull Religions]]"
