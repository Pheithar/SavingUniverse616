Soon afterwards [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]] kidnapped them and disappeared into the time stream.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #5}}\n\nThe Twins reappeared in the modern era, when [[William Rolfson (Earth-616)|Genocide]], son of [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]], contacted a [[Celestials|Celestial Gardener]]. He hoped to receive the [[Death Seed]] and replace Apocalypse as Archangel had. As the Gardener judged his worth, Uriel and Eimin appeared. Using the axe [[Jarnbjorn]], Uriel killed the Celestial. Together, he and Eimin defeated Genocide's forces. They then attacked [[Peak VII|the Peak]]. {{r|Uncanny Avengers #7}} They next travelled with [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] and [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]] to Akkaba City to murder the remainder of [[Clan Akkaba (Earth-616)|Clan Akkaba]] and destroy the city.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #8}}\n\n===Ragnarok Now===\nUsing the [[Jarnbjorn]], the Twins killed a Celestial{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 9}} and incriminated the Earth for said crime. Thus, [[Exitar (Earth-616)|Exitar the Executioner]] would arrive to the planet in order to destroy it.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 15}} The Apocalypse Twins convinced the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] to cast a spell in order to bring every mutant to their ark, in order to ensure the survival of mutantkind while humankind died along with Earth.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 14}}\n\nIn a divergent universe, their plan would have succeeded. But from said universe, the remaining of the Avengers Unity Division arrived and thwarted the Twin's plans.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 20}} Exitar was killed, and Kang fed from his energies to become a powerful being.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 21}} As Havok was fighting Kang, Sunfire used part of the absorbed energy of the Celestial to destroy the Apocalypse Twins and their ark.\n\nDaken and Grim Reaper, the two remaining [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horsemen of Death]] under the service of the Twins, managed to get back to Earth along with the Twin's corpses.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 22}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Life Seed]]<br>[[Death Seed]]\n| Transportation          = The Ark\n| Weapons                 = [[Jarnbjorn]]\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Twins]]"
