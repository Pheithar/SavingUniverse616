When the man found the corpse of an alternate future version of [[Doctor Strange]] in a barn nearby and took the [[Eye of Agamotto]] from him, he returned to Happy Trails and used the artifact on the marshals to make them see their truths, traumatizing them. The old man then rounded up the officers at [[Rawhide Saloon]], forcing them to stand still for days.\n\nAfter arriving in town to investigate Strange's murder, [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] eventually confronted the old man at Rawhide Saloon. When he tried to take the Eye of Agamotto from him, the old man ordered the officers to stop him. In the scuffle, Banner snatched the Eye of Agamotto, and turned into the Hulk. After that, the marshals fled the saloon.{{r|Immortal Hulk: The Best Defense Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
