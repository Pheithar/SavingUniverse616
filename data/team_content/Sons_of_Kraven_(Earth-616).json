They were designed to age into adulthood at an accelerated rate. After Sergei trained them in the [[Savage Land]], he sent all his sons out in the world to establish themselves as hunters and to be worthy of the Kravinoff name. \n\nAfter Kraven regained his wealth and territories he awaited the return of his sons, but noticed that only one of them made it back, and that he killed the rest of them as he deemed them unworthy. He presented the skulls to Kraven which made him proud of his son.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 16}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Clones created by the High Evolutionary]]\n[[Category:Clones of Sergei Kravinoff]]"
