In reality, Phillip used his cultists to perform various shady deals, including those in pornography and drugs, using force when they would not oblige him. [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]], who followed a drug deal back to the cult, fought off the group, a battle which ended when [[Beth (Children of Heaven) (Earth-616)|Beth]], one of the most victimized cultists, sent a psychic bolt through Phillip's head. Phillip was taken into custody by the Police. Some of the members left, but Beth, [[Michael (Children of Heaven) (Earth-616)|Mike]], [[Slimeball (Children of Heaven) (Earth-616)|Slimeball]], [[Voodoo (Donny) (Earth-616)|Voodoo]], and presumably a few others decided to stay together to help other kids with similar problems. Archangel offered for them to come live at the Xavier Mansion but they turned him down.{{r|X-Factor #47}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
