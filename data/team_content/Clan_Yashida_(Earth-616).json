Under his leadership, Clan Yashida were bringing in x10 as much money as the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]]'s organization, with x10 the blood spilled.{{r|Wolverine #1|4}}{{r|New Avengers #11}} [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] tore down his empire, before killing him.{{r|Wolverine #1|4}}\n\nHis daughter [[Mariko Yashida (Earth-616)|Mariko Yashida]] took over, and vowed to end the clan's involvement with the underworld and go legitimate.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #172|173}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #176}} She became a major power in Japan's underworld, though she was opposed by the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]] and her half-brother, the [[Keniuchio Harada (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]] who undermined her authority. She was poisoned by the Hand, and to end her suffering, Wolverine killed her.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 55|57}}\n\nThe Silver Samurai turned out to be an ineffective leader, resulting in the clan ending up under the control of the Mongolian [[Clan Kaishek (Earth-616)|Clan Kaishek]]. Due to the manipulations of [[Kia Kaishek (Earth-616)|Kia Kaishek]], Wolverine was drawn into a Kaishek power struggle. Upon the end of the conflict, Clan Yashida regained its independence.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 150|153}}\n\nShingen Harada II later represented the Yashida Corporation when meeting with other business leaders at the [[Universal Bank]] when it came to [[Dario Agger (Earth-616)|Dario Agger]] and [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]]'s plans for the [[Glossary:Ten Realms|Ten Realms]].{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 8}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Japanese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Chris Claremont/Creator]]\n[[Category:Frank Miller/Creator]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Yakuza]]"
