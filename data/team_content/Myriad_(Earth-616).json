They were deserters and runaways -- with an agenda of greed, gain, and global domination -- who established their own criminal cartel. The [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-616)|Squadron Supreme]] shut down a Myriad arms trafficking operation dealing with nuclear isotopes, and investigated a Myriad undersea base, at the same time that the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]] were doing the same.{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 4 6|7}}\n\n[[Zarda Shelton (Earth-21195)|Warrior Woman]], who had betrayed Squadron Supreme by making a pact with [[Modred (Earth-616)|Modred the Mystic]], used his magic to take over the Myriad organization, turning it from a crime syndicate of several thousand disenfranchised aliens focused on profit, into an army bent on conquering the [[Earth]]. With the might of their warriors, within one day they conquered the savage and barbaric [[Africa|North African]] nation of [[Alambra]], and by utilizing alien technology, turned it into a nation a century ahead of its time overnight.{{r|Squadron Supreme Vol 4 8|9}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Alien Military Forces]]\n[[Category:Arms Dealers]]"
