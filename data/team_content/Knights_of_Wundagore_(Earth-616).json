The Knights of Wundagore are formed, and Chthon, attacking through a host body called [[Other|The Other]], is defeated.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 22}}\n\nUsing a new isotope, The Evolutionary created the [[Man-Beast (Earth-616)|Man-Beast]], an evolved from wolf with mental powers, who quickly ousted his creator from his citadel in a bid to take over the world.{{r|Thor Vol 1 134}} [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] helps the Knights to defeat the Man-Beast, but the Evolutionary decides to take his citadel into space to seek a new destiny for his creations.{{r|Thor Vol 1 135}}\n\n===Into Space===\nThe High Evolutionary, converting his citadel into a spaceship, left earth along with his Knights. After creating his own version of Earth known as [[Counter-Earth (High Evolutionary)|Counter-Earth]], The Evolutionary and his Knights are attacked by Man-Beast, who followed them to the new world with his own New Men.{{r|Marvel Premiere Vol 1 1}} With the help of [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]], the Man-Beast is defeated and partially devolved.{{r|Warlock Vol 1 2}}\n\nThe High Evolutionary later migrated his New Men to a planet in the [[Sirius (Star)|Sirius]] solar system he called [[Wundagore II]]. Giving in to their animalistic nature, all New Men, including the Knights, eventually became savage and warlike. With their society threatened, the Evolutionary evolved himself into possessing god-like psionic powers and devolved his own creations, including the Knights, back into normal animals. \n\nSome time later, this world would be discovered by [[Arcturus (Rigellian) (Earth-616)|Commander Arcturus]] of the [[Rigellians|Rigellian]] colonizers who was seeking a new homeworld to use as a staging ground to wage war against his people's leader, the [[Rigellian Grand Commissioner (Earth-616)|Grand Commissioner]]. When one of Arcturus' irradiated probes lands on Wundagore II, it creates a mutagenic effect which evolves all the New Men back to their humanoid forms. Arcturus' fleet attacks the planet, but are ultimately repelled by a collaboration of the Knights, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], the [[Jonathan Hart (Earth-616)|Jack of Hearts]], and the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers (Earth-616)|Soviet Super-Soldiers]]. The New Men re-formed their society and, now led by the Knight [[Sir Lyan (Earth-616)|Sir Lyan]], continued to live in peace.\n\n===Siege of Wundagore===\nReturning to Earth, the High Evolutionary must fight to reclaim his former home of Wundagore Mountain from the [[Acolytes (Earth-616)|Acolytes]], who see the site as holy ground since it was the last known location of [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]'s wife, [[Magda Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magda]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 380}} To prevent further attacks, he creates a new team of Knights to watch over his citadel, who eventually do battle with the Acolytes and [[Genoshan Mutates]] during their attempt to re-take the mountain.{{r|Quicksilver Vol 1 1}} Forced to retreat, the Knights re-group at their New York base, The Haven, and the Evolutionary appoints [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] as the new team leader while he recouperates in the [[Savage Land]].{{r|Quicksilver Vol 1 2}}\n\nWhen the Evolutionary's Savage Land base is attacked by mutants hired by [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Exodus]], the Knights come to his aid, only to find out that one of their members, Lord Anon, is in fact the Man-Beast, having killed the original holder of the name, [[Sir Wulf (Earth-616)|Sir Wulf]].{{r|Quicksilver Vol 1 11}} The Knights later team up with the [[Heroes for Hire (Oracle Inc.) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]] and are able to re-claim their home from the combined forces of Man-Beast and the Acolytes.{{r|Heroes for Hire / Quicksilver Vol 1 '98}} Quicksilver leaves the team shortly afterward.{{r|Quicksilver Vol 1 13}}\n\n===Endangered Species===\nAfter the events of [[M-Day]], where the majority of Earth's mutants lost their powers and the X-Gene was seemingly wiped from humanity, the X-Man [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] travels to Wundagore Mountain to meet with the Evolutionary to find a way to reverse it. There, he meets with a new group of Knights led by [[Snow Queen (New Men) (Earth-616)|Snow Queen]], who attack him before his audience.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 488}}\n\n===Earth's Mightiest===\nIn an attempt to summon the [[Elder Gods of Earth|Elder God]] Chthon back into the world, the dark magician [[Modred (Earth-616)|Modred]] seized control of the Dark Hold cavern underneath Wundagore Mountain, killing every Knight present, except for Bova, before being defeated by the [[Mighty Avengers (Pym) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]].{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 21}} It is unknown which Knights specifically were slain during the attack.\n\n| Equipment               = \nAdvanced armor.\n| Transportation          = \n'''\"[[Atomic Steed|Atomic Steeds]]\"''': which the High Evolutionary constructed them with help from the ghost of a 6th century magician named Magus.\n| Weapons                 = \nAdvanced weaponry, ranging from swords to energy weapons.\n| Notes                   = * An [[Knights of Wundagore (Earth-751263)|alternate version]] of the Knights of Wundagore are featured in the ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (animated series)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' animated series.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.immortalthor.net/bio-knightsofwundagore.html\n}}\n[[Category:Orders of Knights]]"
