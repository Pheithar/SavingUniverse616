[[China]] as secret societies in ancient imperial China and over time evolved into criminal organizations.{{r|Scarlet Witch Vol 2 7}} The Triads being an organized crime group were involved in a wide variety of criminal activities, including narcotics,{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 1 3}}{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 3 4}}{{r|Journey Into Mystery Vol 1 516}} prostitution,{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 2 2}}{{r|Dark Reign: Mister Negative Vol 1 1}} money laundering,{{r|Punisher Vol 2 17}}{{r|Punisher Vol 6 34}} gambling,{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 38}}{{r|Dark Reign: Mister Negative Vol 1 1}} human trafficking,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 7}}{{r|Punisher Vol 6 34}} contraband smuggling,{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 62}} people smuggling,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 7}} arms trafficking,{{r|X-Force Vol 1 107}}{{r|Punisher Vol 6 34}} counterfeit goods,{{r|2020 iWolverine Vol 1 1}} and protection rackets.{{r|Punisher Vol 2 51}} In the Far East, the leaders of the individual Triads were considered \"Lords\" of the underworld and whomever united and ruled the Chinese underworld was considered the \"Overlord\".{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 257}} \n\nTriads were either led by a single individual (e.g. [[Inner Demons (Earth-616)|Inner Demons]]) or by a ruling council (e.g. [[Sydney Triad (Earth-616)|Sydney Triad]]).{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 547|548}}{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 9}} The most powerful Triad of them all, was one that had an invisible worldwide empire and a globe-spanning army. It was a Triad with ambitions of global conquest. Which was the [[Celestial Order of the Si-Fan (Earth-616)|Celestial Order of the Si-Fan]] led by [[Zheng Zu (Earth-616)|Fu Manchu]].{{r|Special Marvel Edition Vol 1 15}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 27}} Several other individuals became \"Overlords\" or its equivalent, though none among the Triad leaders reached the level of power that Fu Manchu possessed. They became the Overlord (or the equivalent boss of bosses) of the Triads in a region (the Far East), a city (Mandarin City), or a Chinatown. \n\nAsia's Triads came under the rule of the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]] and later the [[Zheng Bao Yu (Earth-616)|Cursed Lotus]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 257}}{{r|Journey into Mystery Vol 1 514|516}} After the fall of the Mandarin, [[Lord Remaker (Earth-616)|Lord Remaker]] brought the Triads of Mandarin City under his control.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 10}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 21}} In San Francisco, there were several Overlord-like bosses with the title of \"Black Dragon\"; most recently [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Fat Cobra (Earth-616)|Fat Cobra]].{{r|Wolverine: Manifest Destiny Vol 1 4}}{{r|Wolverine: Manifest Destiny Vol 1 4}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 304}} On the American eastern coast, [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mister Negative]] ruled the mobs of [[New York City]]'s Chinatown.{{r|Dark Reign: Mister Negative Vol 1 1|3}} Recently the resurrected [[Leiko Wu (Earth-616)|Leiko Wu]] inherited [[London]]'s Chinatown.{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 2 4}}\n\nTechnologically, the most advanced Triad were the Celestial Order of the Si-Fan. It was an organization which had established massive secret fortresses, ranging from subterranean complexes to fortified skyscrapers to orbital space stations.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 48|49}}{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 11}}{{r|Special Marvel Edition Vol 1 15}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 17|18}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 22}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 49|51}} The organization developed and/or used such technologies as cybernetics and mind-control devices, spacecraft and submersible vessels, jetpacks and airships, beam and lightning weapons, genetically-engineered giant monsters and human-animal hybrids, and both nuclear and chemical weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).{{r|X-Men Vol 2 63|64}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 84}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 50|51}}{{r|Kung Fu Special Vol 1 1}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 86}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 47}}{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 11}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 49}}{{r|Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu #6}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 116}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 118}}{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 1 4}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 50}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 88|89}}{{r|Marvel Knights Vol 1 4}} Among the Triads it possessed the most lethal army, one that was made up of assassins who were fanatically loyal to Fu Manchu. Assassins whose mastery of the art of death made professional killers of the criminal underworld seem like novices.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 21}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 27}}\n\nWithin the United States, the most technologically advanced and dangerous Chinese mob were the [[Inner Demons (Earth-616)|Inner Demons]]. They were a Tong led by [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mister Negative]], a  powerful mutate. Which developed and/or used such technologies as nanotechnology and cybernetics, beam and sonic weapons, and adamantium and poison gas.{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man Vol 1 14}}{{r|Spider-Man: Brand New Day \u2014 Extra! Vol 1 1}}{{r|Superior Foes of Spider-Man Vol 1 16}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 564}}{{r|Spider-Man: Brand New Day \u2014 Extra! Vol 1 1}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 547}} Mister Negative bestowed on his men the ability to regenerate, which gave him a small army of nearly unkillable soldiers. Inner Demons were trained in the martial arts and were armed to the teeth with electrified martial arts weapons, as well as with firearms.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 547|548}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 619|621}}{{r|X-Men: To Serve and Protect Vol 1 1|2}}\n\nIn addition to Fu Manchu, a number of other Chinese crime lords ran empires that crossed oceans or encompassed whole continents, including; [[Yi Yang (Earth-616)|Yi Yang]], [[Marcus Tsung (Earth-616)|Marcus Tsung]], and Mister Negative. The mutant Marcus Tsung ruled a criminal empire that stretched across three large nations (China, India, and Russia).{{r|X-Force Vol 1 107}} The immortal [[Yi Yang (Earth-616)|Yi Yang]] controlled an empire with operations in both the United States and Russia.{{r|Hulk Comic (UK) Vol 1 15|20}}{{r|Daredevils Vol 1 7|11}}{{r|Fury / Black Widow: Death Duty Vol 1 1}} Mister Negative's empire was present in both the United States and China.{{r|Dark Reign: Mister Negative Vol 1 1|3}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 6|8}}{{r|Cloak and Dagger: Negative Exposure - Marvel Digital Original Vol 1 1|3}} Two non-Chinese became Triad leaders, the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] who for a period led the Si-Fan (or a faction of the organization) and the mutant Wolverine in San Francisco who became its Black Dragon (till he willingly abdicated the position).{{r|X-Men Vol 2 62|64}}{{r|Wolverine: Manifest Destiny Vol 1 1|4}}\n\nDuring different periods, various Triads came under the spheres of influence of the [[Celestial Order of the Si-Fan (Earth-616)|Celestial Order of the Si-Fan]], the [[Great Wall (Earth-616)|Great Wall Society]], or the [[Atlas Foundation (Earth-616)|Atlas Foundation]].{{r|Journey into Mystery Vol 1 514|516}}{{r|Agents of Atlas Vol 2 9}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 17|19}} Triads have formed alliances with the ninjas of the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]], the mutant Inner Circle of the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]], and the [[Molina (Earth-616)|Russian Mafia]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 257|258}}{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 5|9}}{{r|Fury / Black Widow: Death Duty Vol 1 1}} New York City's [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] had a long prosperous business relationship with the Triads (both Hong Kong's Triads and the Tongs of New York City's Chinatown).{{r|Punisher Vol 2 17|18}}{{r|Daredevil Vol 1 340|342}} Triads have also formed alliances with inter-dimensional groups (the [[Silent Ones (Earth-616)|Silent Ones]] and the [[Crimson Pirates (Earth-616)|Crimson Pirates]]), and they've worked with the [[Red Dragons|dragons]] of [[Subterranea]].{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 1 3|4}}{{r|X-Men Vol 2 104}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 17|19}} One Triad, the Inner Demons formed an alliance with an interdimensional Lovecraftian god, the [[Devourer (Deity) (Earth-616)|Devourer]], and in the process threatened all of Earth.{{r|Cloak and Dagger: Negative Exposure - Marvel Digital Original Vol 1 1}}\n\nVarious costumed superheroes, mutants, and vigilantes had encounters with the Triads and their affiliates. Which included the martial arts masters [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]] and [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], the agents of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], the mutant [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] the vigilante, the Avengers [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], and the British spies of [[MI6 (Earth-616)|MI6]]. Among the heroes, Shang-Chi has been the Si-Fan's greatest enemy, as well as that of Fu Manchu. In New York, among its costumes, it has been Spider-Man who has been Mister Negative's greatest foe, and therefore that of the Inner Demons.{{r|Journey into Mystery Vol 1 514|516}}{{r|Iron Fist Vol 1
