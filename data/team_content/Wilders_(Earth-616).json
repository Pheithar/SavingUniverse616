Bullseye had them gathered and tested before setting them loose on the city to wreak havoc where the Wilders' new hypersenses would drive them into a mad frenzy. Daredevil managed to track down and incapacitate the Wilders as they rampaged across the city by using their enhanced senses against them.{{r|Daredevil Vol 3 23}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
