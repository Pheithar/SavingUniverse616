This group consisted of [[Johnathon Ohnn (Earth-616)|Spot (Johnathon Ohnn)]], [[Brian Hibbs (Earth-616)|Kangaroo II (Brian Hibbs)]], [[Maxwell Markham (Earth-616)|Grizzly (Max Markham)]], and [[Martin Blank (Earth-616)|Gibbon (Martin Blank)]]. All of them faced Spider-Man before and were easily defeated, so they united to get revenge on him. When they faced him, he let them think they defeated him, so he could discover what they wanted to do next. They robbed a bank, but soon Grizzly and Gibbon found out that this was not what they wanted to do, and started fighting with Spot and Kangaroo. After quickly defeating the latter, they \"found out\" that Spider-Man was only faking being unconscious. They delivered the money back to him and he fled, saying that he will not web them because they delivered back the money and gave up being criminals.\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n* The name is likely a play on the [[DC Universe]] team the [[w:c:dc:Superman Revenge Squad|Superman Revenge Squad]]\n*The \"Legion of Losers\" should not be confused with the \"[[League of Losers]]\".\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
