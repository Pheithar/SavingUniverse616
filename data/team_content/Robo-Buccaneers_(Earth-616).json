After uncovering Barracuda's caviar smuggling ring, the super hero [[Walter Newell (Earth-616)|Stingray]] found himself in a face-off against the villain and the Robo-Buccaneers aboard their ship. The confrontation was interrupted by the arrival of a submarine piloted by [[Samuel Saxon (Earth-616)|Machinesmith]], a representative of the rising [[A.I. Army (Earth-616)|A.I. Army]]. He used an [[Un-Inhibitor]] to grant the Robo-Buccaneers free will unrestrained by Captain Barracuda's control. They all decided to desert him and join the A.I. Army.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * One of the Robo-Buccaneers was a parrot companion for [[Captain Barracuda (Earth-616)|Captain Barracuda]] that also abandoned him when given free will.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 2}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Robots (Full Listing)]]"
