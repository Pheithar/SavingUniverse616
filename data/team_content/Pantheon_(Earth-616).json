Stationed in the [[Nevada (State)|Nevada]] desert based headquarters called [[Mount|The Mount]], the Pantheon have recruited the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] as a member and ally, and the team joined him on several adventures. Internal struggles and the devious actions of Agamemnon and former team member [[Nathan Taylor (Earth-616)|Paris]] led to the Pantheon's eventual pilgrimage away from The Mount, and ultimately to their recruitment by the United States government. Members of the team possess super strength, a healing factor, and are able to create energy formed weaponry.{{Citation}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * It seems that certain powers are recurring throughout the Pantheon's history{{citation}} and their code names may come from which power they have.{{citation}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = *[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/pantheonhulk.htm The Pantheon at The Appendix to the Marvel Universe Handbook]\n}}"
