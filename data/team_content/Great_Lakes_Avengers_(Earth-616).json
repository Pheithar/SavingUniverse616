He soon realized his heroic endeavors would be easier with a team and took out an ad calling for men and women of action. Meeting at a local [[wikipedia:YMCA|YMCA]], Mr. Immortal was joined by [[Ashley Crawford (Earth-616)|Big Bertha]], [[Dinah Soar (Earth-616)|Dinah Soar]], [[DeMarr Davis (Earth-616)|Doorman]], [[Val Ventura (Earth-616)|Flatman]], and [[Gene Lorrene (Earth-616)|Leather Boy]].{{r|G.L.A. Vol 1 1}} Together they formed the '''''[[Great Lakes Avengers]]''''' as a sister team to the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)| West Coast Avengers]] and [[Avengers (Earth-616)|(East Coast) Avengers]].{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 46}}{{r|G.L.A. Vol 1 1}}\n\n===Great Lakes Avengers===\nThe team began fighting crime and quickly caught the attention of [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]]. The pair traveled to [[Wisconsin (State)|Wisconsin]] to check to these \"impostor\" Avengers. After determining they ''were'' just a group of (if somewhat oddball) heroes, Hawkeye and Mockingbird took it upon themselves to train the team. Originally the team heavily depended on [[Ashley Crawford (Earth-616)|Ashley Crawford]]'s modelling income to provide funding for [[Big Bertha's Place|their headquarters]] and the team also used her private jet.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 46}}{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 1 48}}\n\nNot long after beginning training with Hawkeye and Mockingbird, the Great Lakes Avengers were called to [[Texas (State)|Texas]] to help the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], and [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] to rescue the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] and the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]]. After the team successfully aided in the rescue, Captain America gave them permission to use the ''[[Avengers]]'' title.{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 1 48}} The Great Lakes Avengers continued to train with Hawkeye and Mockingbird.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 309}}{{r|Avengers: West Coast Annual Vol 1 6}} When [[Terminus (Destroyer) (Earth-616)|Terminus]] began attacking [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri (State)|Missouri]], Captain America called on The Great Lakes Avengers to battle him until the other Avengers could arrive as reinforcement.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 19}} The Great Lakes Avengers were again called into action by Captain America to help him and the [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] respond to a mysterious distress call from in the rescue of [[Stevie (Earth-616)|\"Rick Jones\"]].{{r|Avengers: West Coast Vol 1 64}}\n\n===Lightning Rods===\n[[File:Great Lakes Avengers (Earth-616) from Deadpool Vol 3 10 01.png|200px|thumb|left|The Lightning Rods]]\nAfter the Avengers were seemingly killed during [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] took over heroic responsibilities in [[New York City|New York]]. Attempting to \"cash-in\" on the popularity of the Thunderbolts, Mr. Immortal re-branded the team as the '''''[[Lightning Rods]]'''''.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 10}} They also briefly teamed-up with [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] and [[Jack Hammer (Earth-616)|Weasel]] when they crossed paths.{{r|Deadpool Vol 3 11}} When it was later revealed that the Thunderbolts were secretly the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]], the team approached [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] with the request to bring the Thunderbolts in themselves. Unfortunately, the Lightning Rods were no match for Thunderbolts.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 #15|#17}}\n\n===Misassembled===\nReturning to their former name, Great Lakes Avenger and though they mostly just hung out and played cards,{{r|G.L.A. Vol 1 1}} they still engaged in superheroics such as rescuing victims from a tornado in [[Ohio (State)|Ohio]].{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 25}} When news came in that the Avengers had [[Avengers Disassembled|disassembled]], a disheartened Mr. Immortal was reinvigorated and took the team out patrolling. The team came upon [[Maelstrom (Earth-616)|Maelstrom]] stealing a [[Glossary:Chronokinesis|Chronal Accelerator]]. Unfortunately, [[Dinah Soar (Earth-616)|Dinah Soar]] was killed during the battle. After Dinah's death, Mr. Immortal fell into a psychotic depression. Meanwhile, Doorman and Flatman traveled to [[New York City]] to recruit more new members. Although most heroes turned them down immediately, [[Doreen Green (Earth-616)|Squirrel Girl]] and [[Monkey Joe (Earth-616)|Monkey Joe]], her squirrel partner, agreed to join. [[Douglas Taggert (Earth-616)|Grasshopper]] also join, but died almost immediately upon accepting his membership. The GLA continued to investigate Maelstrom's theft, and with help from [[Deathurge (Earth-616)|Deathurge]], the team narrowly defeated him and prevented his plans to end time.{{r|G.L.A. Vol 1 #1|#4}}\n\n\n===Great Lakes <s>X-Men</s>? <s>Defenders</s>? Champions?===\n[[File:Great Lakes X-Men (Earth-616) from G.L.A. Vol 1 4 001.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[X-Men|Great Lakes X-Men]]]]\nWith a cease and desist order and threatened lawsuit from the [[Maria Stark Foundation (Earth-616)|Maria Stark Foundation]], the GLA again had to rebrand. When the surviving member of the GLA all realized they were [[Homo superior|mutants]], they decided to become the '''''[[X-Men|Great Lakes X-Men]]''''' (or GLX).{{r|G.L.A. Vol 1 4}} Although the team continued to operate under the X-Men title, they soon abandoned their [[X-Uniform|leather X-Men-style costumes]] because the outfits were designed by their former teammate/arch nemesis, [[Gene Lorrene (Earth-616)|Leather Boy]].{{r|GLX-Mas Special Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe GLX dealt with a steady increase in supervillain activity around [[Wisconsin (State)|Wisconsin]] during the holiday season including an attack by [[Doctor Tannenbaum (Earth-616)|Dr. Tannenbaum]]'s evil pine trees, a scheme by [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] using the [[Pyramatrix]], and an insurgency of [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]]{{r|GLX-Mas Special Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe team attended the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]]'s superhero poker tournament under Squirrel Girl's invitation. Upon hearing they were using the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]'s name, [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Marvel Girl]] used her [[Telepathy|telepathy]] on Mr. Immortal, who ventured the ''Great Lakes Defenders'', before being similarly rebuffed by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]]. When they all reached the final table, with [[Val Ventura (Earth-616)|Flatman]] beating the Thing, they plumped for '''''[[Champions|Great Lakes Champions]]''''' (or GLC), despite [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]]' protests.{{r|Thing Vol 2 8}}\n\n===Great Lakes Initiative===\n[[File:Great Lakes Avengers (Earth-616) and Wade Wilson (Earth-616) vs Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616) from Deadpool GLI - Summer Fun Spectacular Vol 1 1 001.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Great Lakes Initiative with Deadpool against A.I.M.]]\nThe GLC eagerly signed up under the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], becoming the official government sanctioned protectors of [[Wisconsin (State)|Wisconsin]], the '''''[[Great Lakes Initiative]]''''' or GLI.{{r|Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 30}}{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report Vol 1 1}}{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 19}}{{r|Deadpool GLI - Summer Fun Spectacular Vol 1 1}} Despite signing up immediately, the GLI team was attacked by [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] in a misbegotten plan to win government favor by bringing in unregistered, rogue superhumans.{{r|Cable & Deadpool Vol 1 30}}\n\nThe GLI enjoyed the legitimacy the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] brought, and especially enjoyed the government funding. The GLI reluctantly teamed-up with Deadpool to stop [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] from using an \"[[Inebriation Wave]]\" powered by [[Dionysus Acratophorus (Earth-616)|Dionysus]]. Deadpool was then granted reserve membership on the team, but he was forcibly evicted from their [[Great Lakes Initiative Headquarters|headquarters]] after proving too much of an annoyance. Before leaving, Deadpool broke the neck of the all-new [[Grasshopper (Unnamed) (Earth-616)|Grasshopper]] who was attempting to join the GLI.{{r|Deadpool GLI - Summer Fun Spectacular Vol 1 1}}\n\nDuring the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] of [[Earth]], the GLI's newest member, [[Grasshopper (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Grasshopper]], was discovered to be a [[Skrulls|Skrull]], and was killed by the team immediately.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 19}} When [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] took over [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], he reassigned [[Greg Willis (Earth-616)|Gravity]] to join the GLI.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 25}}\n\nFeeling that she was holding the team back by single-handedly defeating villains like [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]], [[George Tarleton (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]], [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]], [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], [[Giganto (Atlantean Beast)|Giganto]], [[Fin Fang Foom (Earth-616)|Fin Fang Foom]], [[Michael Korvac (Earth-691)|Korvac]], [[Karl Mordo (Earth-616)|Baron Mordo]], and [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego the Living Planet]], Squirrel Girl and Tippy-Toe left the GLA and returned to [[New York City]].{{r|GLX-Mas Special Vol 1 1}}{{r|Age of Heroes Vol 1 3}}{{r|Heroic Age: Heroes Vol 1 1}}\n\nDuring [[Fear Itself|the attacks of]] [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|the Serpent]], the GLA members were attacked by angry, fearful mobs,{{r|Fear Itself: The Home Front Vol 1 6}} and sometime later they disbanded and went their separate ways.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 1}}\n\n===GLA in Detroit===\nThey spent apart until the ownership of the trademark for the ''\"[[Avengers]]\"'' name was transferred, as a consequence of major shake-ups in [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Holdings]], to the only other entity who had also applied for the trademark, Flatman. [[Connie Ferrari (Earth-616)|Connie Ferrari]], the legal representative of the Avengers, attempted to negotiate with him to buy the name back, and Flatman managed to get her to reinstate the Great Lake Avengers as a permanent and official addition to the Avengers.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 1}}\n\nHe then attempted to get the band together, but only Big Bertha and Doorman appeared, because Doreen was now too famous and, unknown to them Craig's phone was now in possession of a local girl named [[Pansy (Earth-616)|Pansy]]. Unwilling to \"assume things,\" Pansy showed up at the rendezvous point, an abandoned Stark Assembly and Manufacturing plant the Avengers had set up as the GLA new headquarters in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan (State)|Michigan]], and waited for the Great Lakes Avengers. Once they arrived, Pansy cleared up the confusion caused by her presence and showed the team around the facilities.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 1}}\n\n[[File:Great Lakes Avengers (Earth-616) from Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 2 001.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Meeting Good Boy]]\nThe team's problems began when they had the tremendous idea of going to a local bar in the middle of the night and try to convince them to turn the music volume down. The owner [[Dick Snerd (Earth-616)|Nain Rouge]] instead refuses and begins to insult them. Upon getting arrested after a fight, Flatman and Bertha are left in jail with a young girl named [[Goodness Silva (Earth-616)|Goodness Silva]], who can turn into a wolf. There are some complications, but everything turns out fine as they're all later released thanks to [[Connie Ferrari (Earth-616)|Connie Ferrari]], the legal representative of the Avengers.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 2}}\n\n[[File:Craig Hollis (Earth-616) from Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 3 001.jpg|180px|thumb|left|The Return of Mr. I]]\nFollowing this misadventure, the team was served with an injunction, forbidding them from performing any superhero activity. Mister Immortal rejoined the team and went on patrol with Flatman while Bertha, Doorman, and Goodness, now going by the name of Good Boy, investigated Nain Rouge's bar, where they found the villain was in fact councilman Dick Snerd.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 3}} When Flatman and Mister Immortal returned from patrol, they discovered Bertha and Good Boy had taken Snerd hostage. When Connie arrived to help the team with the injunction, she not only found that they had taken Snerd, but also that in a fit of rage, Good Boy severely hurt him. The team dropped him off at a hospital and escaped.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 4}}\n\nThe Great Lakes Avengers' following call to action occurred after Big Bertha was kidnapped by a scientist named [[Doctor Nod (Earth-616)|Doctor Nod]] who harvested her DNA to create a pill supplement to alter its user's weight at will. Even though Bertha managed to escape from his grasp on her own, Doctor Nod tried to take her down, consuming an enormous amount of his own pills in the process, becoming a mindless giant who started to tear the city apart.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 #5|6}} Doctor Nod was finally defeated after Doorman teleported Mister Immortal inside his body and had him punch his heart.\n\nEven though the city applauded the heroes, the GLA's rejoicing was abruptly cut short when Deadpool appeared on their doorstep and, as a member of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]], told them they were fired, informing them that their legal claim of the name didn't hold up in court. He stated that people simply didn't like them, but comfort them, proclaiming that in a few years they could try to be in the spotlight again.{{r|Great Lakes Avengers Vol 1 7}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n* [[Giant Robot Snowman|Giant Robot Snowman's Head]]\n* [[Grasshopper's Suit]] (formerly){{r|G.L.A.
