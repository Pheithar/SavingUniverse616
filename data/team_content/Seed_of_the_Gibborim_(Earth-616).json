After the [[Pride (Earth-616)|Pride]] cleansed it of nearly all [[Homo sapiens|humanity]], the Seed of the Gibborim were meant to inherit the [[Earth]] empowered and fed by the billions of sacrificed souls.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 13}} Unfortunately for them, the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]] stopped their parents' Rite of Thunder, freed the soul of [[Destiny Gonzales (Earth-616)|Destiny Gonzales]], and trapped the Gibborim in [[Limbo (Otherplace)|Limbo]].{{r|Runaways Vol 1 17}}{{r|Runaways Vol 5 13}}\n\nInstead of awakening from their chrysalises fortified with the power of billions of sacrificed souls, the Seed of the Gibborim woke up hungry, weak, short, and alone. Angry to find an Earth still infested with humanity, the Seed of the Gibborim found the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]] to demand they honor their parents promise.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 13}} Although most flatly refused to participate, [[Alex Wilder (Earth-616)|Alex Wilder]] asked for time to prepare and the Seed of the Gibborim granted them a week. Gib was assigned to stay at the [[Hostel (Bronson Canyon)|Hostel]] to guard the Runaways while Bo and Rim.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 14}}\n\nWhen Rim and Bo returned, Gib tried to convince them to forgo the Rite of Thunder and even fought to defend the Runaways. While Gib attempted to convince his nestmates, [[Gertrude Yorkes (Earth-616)|Gert]] used her remote to summon the [[4-D Time Portico]] to transport Bo and Rim 999 years into the future. Gib was left alone and chose to join the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]].{{r|Runaways Vol 5 18}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
