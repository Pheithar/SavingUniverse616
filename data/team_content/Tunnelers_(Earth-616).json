They were one of the few groups of [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] to defeat the Marauders on their own, losing half their number in repelling the Marauders.\n\nThe remaining members ([[Blow-Hard (Earth-616)|Blow-Hard]], [[Masque (Earth-616)|Masque]], [[Scaleface (Earth-616)|Scaleface]], and [[Ray Carter (Earth-616)|Berzerker]]) reluctantly accepted [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]'s offer of shelter, but later snuck out into the city. While contemplating their future, they were attacked by the [[Savage Wolf Gang (Earth-616)|Savage Wolf Gang]], and later [[New York City Police Department|NYPD police officers]]. X-Factor tried to stop the fighting, but failed, and all but Masque were slain.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
