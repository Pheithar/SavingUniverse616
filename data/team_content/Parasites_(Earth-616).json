Being a warpie himself, he was attracted by Siren's powers and rescue them. Slowly, others warpies came to them and formed the '''Parasites''', James training them to the use of his powers and made them became thieves.\n\nHis band was formed by [[Hal (Warpies) (Earth-616)|Hal]], [[Nettle (Earth-616)|Nettle]], [[Peeping Tom (Earth-616)|Peeping Tom]], [[Ramora (Earth-616)|Ramora]], [[Siren (Warpies)|Siren]], [[Spasm (Earth-616)|Spasm]], [[Snap (Warpies) (Earth-616)|Snap]] and [[Moley (Warpies) (Earth-616)|Moley]].\n\nSomehow, this last quit the team or was killed (maybe both) by Lex after a conflict.\n\nAfter a time, Uncle Lex intended to grow his group to form an army under his control.\n\nWhen the [[Resources Control Executive (Earth-616)|R.C.X.]] gone-rogue Warpies team [[Cherubim (Earth-616)|Cherubim]] came to London, he recruited them, but when Snap was crashed by a bus during a robbery and his friends don't look back, the Cherubim decided to quit the team, but Uncle Lex refused them to leave, letting his Parasites battle with them. \n\nSeeing a defeat come, he eventually let them go, stating he had plenty of Warpies to come, thank to Siren's powers. However he was still hoping they will come back, especially [[Giggles (Earth-616)|Giggles]], who had impressioned him and had winkled him before leaving.\n\nThe fate of the Parasites is unknown.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Formerly [[Snap (Warpies) (Earth-616)|Snap]]'s teleportation.\n| Weapons                 = [[Warpies (Race)|Warpies]] Powers\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.rayeye.nl/ Rayeye's Ocean X] (NL)\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe]\n}}\n[[Category:Jaspers Warp]]"
