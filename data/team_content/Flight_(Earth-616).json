The Flight's first (and only documented) mission pitted them against [[Elihas Starr (Earth-616)|Egghead (Elihas Starr)]] and several of his hired super-human henchmen ([[Silas King (Earth-616)|Solarr]], [[Alexander Gentry (Earth-616)|Porcupine]], [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]], [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman (Jacques Duquesne)]], [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Power Man (Erik Josten)]]). \n\nEgghead was planning on launching a nuclear missile into [[New York City]] from a location within [[Ontario]]. The Flight was able to stop him, despite the fact that [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]] could barely control himself and that [[Alexander Thorne (Earth-616)|Smart Alec]] snapped under the pressure. In order to save the Flight, [[Saint Elmo (Earth-616)|Saint Elmo]] had to sacrifice his life to absorb the explosion. \n\nDue to the failure of his first efforts, Hudson revised his plans and created a tiered system for the Flight:\n* [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] - Active super-human response unit\n* [[Beta Flight (Earth-616)|Beta Flight]] - Training program\n* [[Gamma Flight (Earth-616)|Gamma Flight]] - Initial training program\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Helicopter\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Department H Projects]]\n[[Category:Canadian Organizations]]"
