They also hate that the human population has multiplied tremendously in the last century, so much that the Anchorite Sect retreats almost every decade to avoid them and live alone in peace. They chose to side with [[Janus Tepes (Earth-616)|Janus]] rather than [[Xarus (Earth-616)|Xarus]], enlisting the [[Claw Sect]] and [[Mystikos Sect]] to help them. However, the former of the sects was already in league with Xarus, and so the Anchorite leader was executed for their betrayal.{{r|Death of Dracula #1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Vampire Organizations]]"
