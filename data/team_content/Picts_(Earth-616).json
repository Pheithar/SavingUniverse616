They were in a part of [[Europe]] until driven off by the [[Gauls]], and subsequently in the [[British Isles]] until they were driven off by the [[Celts]]. They also battled the [[Roman Empire]] circa 200 AD, then the neighboring Celt/[[British]] kingdoms circa the [[6th century]].\n| History                 = \n===[[Elder Days]]<!-- or early Pre-Cata -->===\nAt the time ape-like humans served the [[Serpent-Men]], a Pictish shaman discovered on cave paintings or carvings that reptilians, including the Serpent-Men and the [[Man-Serpents]], could not say nor stand to hear the phrase, \"[[Ka nama kaa lajerama]]\".{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #192|; The Cape of Dark Dreams - Skull on the Seas Part III}} The humans weaponized this phrase to overthrow the Serpent-Men masters and slaughter the Man-Serpents. After centuries of fighting, the humans erroneously believed to have annihilated both of the serpent races.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #192|; The Cape of Dark Dreams - Skull on the Seas Part III}}\n\nFrom the time of war against the Serpent-Men, these words became engraved in the souls of all men,{{r|Kull the Conqueror #2|; The Shadow Kingdom}} and its knowledge was passed down among the Picts.<!-- as seen in {{r|Kull the Conqueror #2|; The Shadow Kingdom}} -->\n\n===Pre-Cataclysmic Age===\nDuring the [[Pre-Cataclysmic Age]], the Picts lived on the [[Pictish Isles]],{{r|Handbook of the Conan Universe #1|; [[Pictland (Pictish Wilderness)|Pictland]]'s entry}} a chain of islands in the [[Western Ocean]],{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #14|; A King Kull Glossary, Picts}} west of the [[Thuria]] and of [[Atlantis (Empire)|Atlantis]]. Along with the Atlanteans and the [[Lemuria (Pacific Ocean)|Lemurians]], they were the [[barbarians]] of their age. The crumbling Thurian civilizations employed barbarian mercenaries (Picts, Atlanteans and Lemurians) as their armies, and consequently, their generals, their statesmen and often their kings were barbarians.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #7|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 1: The Pre-Cataclysmic Age}}<!-- \n\n[[Nial (Earth-616)|Nial]], over-king of the Picts{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #197|; Raiders of the Pictish Isles}} -->\n\n===Great Cataclysm===\nWhen the [[Great Cataclysm]] occurred, the Pictish Isles were heaved up to form the mountain peaks of a new continent.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #7|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 1: The Pre-Cataclysmic Age}} Its inhabitants perished, but a significant colony of them already established along the mountains of [[Valusia (Kingdom)|Valusia]]'s south frontier were virtually unharmed.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #8|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 2: The Rise of the Hyborians}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #38|; A Gazetteer of the Hyborian World Part VI, [[Picts (Earth-616)|Picts]]' entry}}\n\n===Hyborian Age===\n<!-- Circa 17,000-15,000 -->The Atlanteans and Picts of the mainland fought in the west of the continent. The powerful Pictish nation outnumbered the Atlanteans, who were hurled back into a state of savagery while the evolution of the Picts stopped. Five hundred years after the Cataclysm, both kingdoms vanished. The [[Lesser Cataclysm]] achieve their ruin begun by their tribal wars.<!--Previous sentence needs rewording--> The Picts then remained as scattered clans of cave-dwelling savages with primitive speech, living in the southwest.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #8|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 2: The Rise of the Hyborians}}\n\n<!-- Circa 14,000-10,000 -->1500 years after the Lesser Cataclysm, the Picts apparently defied the laws of nature, neither by progressing or retrogressing, but by remaining savages.<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #12|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 3: The Hyborian Kingdoms}} -->\n\nPicts invaded the [[Valley of Zingg]] and merged with its nameless tribe of agricultural dwellers. The mixed race was in turn absorbed by a conquering tribe of [[Hybori]], and the resulting kingdom became [[Zingara]].<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #12|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 3: The Hyborian Kingdoms}} -->\n\nThe Picts that remained in the [[Pictland (Pictish Wilderness)|Pictish Wilderness]] were confronted by their eastern neighbors, the inhabitants of the [[Bossonian Marches]], which was inhabited by descendants of an aboriginal race mixed with Hyborians.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #12|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 3: The Hyborian Kingdoms}}\n<!-- ...{{r|Supernatural Thrillers #3}} --><!-- possibly after the Age of Conan? The Aesir migration is the one of the Hybori (in {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #8|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 2: The Rise of the Hyborians}}) or of the Nordic tribe or the Aryans later in {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #17|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 6: The Darkness... and the Dawn}} -->\n<!-- ====[[Age of Conan]] (Circa 10,000 BC)====\n...\n -->\n====Circa 9,500 BC====\nThe ever more powerful Picts (as well as the [[Nordheimr]] and the Bossonians) would cause incessant bickering with their Cimmerian neighboors.<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #15|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 4: The Beginning of the End}} -->\n\nAround that time, the [[Nemedia]] priest of [[Mithra (Earth-616)|Mitra]], [[Arus (Nemedian Priest) (Earth-616)|Arus]], decided to introduce the [[worship of Mitra]] to the Picts. Despite having benefited from Hyborian civilization contact, the Picts had always fiercely resisted it. They still dwelt in clans generally at feud with each other. Arus nevertheless managed to remain safely among the Picts after meeting with the unusually intelligent chief named [[Gorm (Pict Chief) (Earth-616)|Gorm]]. In order to convince the Picts of Mitra's benefits, he spoke to Gorm about the wealth and fortune of the Hyborians, but Gorm foxed on the material riches rather than the worship of Mitra.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #15|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 4: The Beginning of the End}}\n\nWishing to see the civilized lands, Gorm requested from Arus to conduct them there, and soon, Picts came and went freely into all Aquilonia. Despite Arus' belief he was converting Picts to Mitra, the savages simply wished, and managed to learn how, to mine their iron deposits and work them into weapon. In doing so, Gorm began to assert dominance over the other Pictish clans.<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #16|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 5: Fire and Slaughter}} -->\n\nSoon, increasing numbers of Picts entered service of Aquilonia's mercenary armies, and once their service completed, returned to the Pictish Wilderness with good ideas of civilized warfare. Gorm, then past middle age, became chief of chief, the closest approach to a king the Picts ad had in thousands of years. He moved against the frontier for war. Realizing his mistake, Arus tried to undo his work but was killed by a drunken Pict. Gorm nevertheless showed his gratitude to Arus by having the skull of his slayer set on top of the priest's cairn. Now clad in scale-mail and wielding steel weapons, the Picts burst upon the Bossonian frontiers, but were still held at bay for years by the Bossonians.<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #16|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 5: Fire and Slaughter}} -->\n\nDue to an eastern war against Nemedia, the Bossonian marches were undermanned, but hearing of the Pictish invasion, whole regiments of Bossonians quit the Nemedian campaign and returned, defeating the Picts in a great battle (while directly causing the defeat of the Aquilonians against the Nemedians). In their wrath, the Aquilonians lured and massacred the Bossonian chiefs then ravaged the marches.<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #16|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 5: Fire and Slaughter}} -->\n\nFree of the Bossonian resistance, and now an old man, Gorm led the Pictish invasion directly to the Aquilonian borders and swarmed the kingdom before its legions could return from the war in the east, causing (by synergy with other causes) the end of the Aquilonian Empire.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #16|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 5: Fire and Slaughter}}\n\nNpw the masters of Aquilonia, the Picts slaughtered nearly all the inhabitants. It is presumably the Pictish thrusts that prevented the [[Hyrkania]]ns from adding [[Stygia (Hyboria)|Stygia]] to their empire. 75 years after encountering Arus, Gorm was slain by [[Hialmar (Nemedian Aesir) (Earth-616)|Hialmar]], a chief of the [[Nemedian Aesir]].<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #17|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 6: The Darkness... and the Dawn}} -->\n\nFor a short age, Hyrkanians and Picts battled each other over the ruins of the conquered world. As the [[Glacial Ages]] began, the Nordic tribes were driven southwards, pushing the Cimmerians as well. Hordes of Aesir and Vanir soon swarmed and reeled the Pictish Empire.<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #17|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 6: The Darkness... and the Dawn}} -->\n\nAnother [[Post-Hyborian Cataclysm|cataclysm]] created the [[British Island]] from the mountains of Western Cimmeria and the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. In the west, the remnants of the Picts possessed the lands.<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #17|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 6: The Darkness... and the Dawn}} -->\n\nIn a later age, they would be overthrown by the westward drift of both Cimmerians and Nordics.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #17|; The Hyborian Age Chapter 6: The Darkness... and the Dawn}}\n\n===Celtic expansion===\nPicts that ruled all [[Europe]], before their primitive empire was destroyed by the [[Gauls]].{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #42|; Kings of the Night}}\n\nWhen two kings arose in the land of the Picts, the conqueror drove out the vanquished, and so many Picts made boats and set sail for the ''\"far-off cliffs that gleamed white in the sunlight\"''. There, they were confronted to a race of red-haired barbarians<!-- the Vanir? or early Gaels? --> whom they drove off. They built huts of wattle, tilled the soil, cleared the forest, before the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Gaels (Earth-616)|Gaels]] came from the [[Isles of the West]]. They drove the Picts into the forest and the mountains, though some Picts refused to leave the lands, hiding themselves into caverns, ravines and caves. Many Picts also mingled with the Celts. The Celtic [[Britons (Earth-616)|Britons]] would later come from [[Gallia]] and conquer the Gaels.<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #69|; The Lost Race, Part II}} -->\n\nA hundred years later, the Briton [[Cororuc (Earth-616)|Cororuc]] would be captured by the \"Little People\" (as the Picts would be known to the Britons), a group of the last pure-blooded Picts. Their priest, an old Pict cursed in his youth by an old witch to live until the last child of the Pictish race shall have passed, intended to slay Cororuc as part of his revenge upon the Celts (despite the fact it was the Gaels and not the Britons who had conquered the Picts). Cororuc was saved by [[Berula (Earth-616)|Berula]], a Pict [[werewolf]] and chief among the [[Alban Picts]], whom he had saved from a [[panther]] earlier,<!-- the Cororuc/wolf/panther battle occurred in {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #68|; The Lost Race}} --> and was given guarantees of friendship by Berula and the old pict.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #69|; The Lost Race, Part II}}\n\n===Roman occupation (circa 200 AD)===\nCirca 200 AD,{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #14|; A Kull Glossary: [[Gonar]]'s entry}} [[Bran Mak Morn (Earth-616)|Bran Mak Morn]], descendant of [[Kull (Earth-616)|King Kull]]'s friend [[Brule (Earth-616)|Brule]],{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #42|; Kings of the Night}} was the first acknowledged king of the Caledonian Picts in 500 years.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #17|; Worms of the Earth Part 2: Curse of the Black Stone}}<!-- ...\n\n{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #16|; Worms of the Earth}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #17|; Worms of the Earth Part 2: Curse of the Black Stone}}\n\n...{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #42|; Kings of the Night}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #43|; Kings of the Night Part II: The Pass of Death}} -->\n\n===6th century===\nDuring the 6th century, Picts (as well as [[Anglo-Saxons]] and [[Irish]]) were among the external enemies of [[Logres]], [[Uther Pendragon (Earth-616)|Uther Pendragon]]'s kingdom.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #3|; [[Arthur Pendragon (Earth-616)|Arthur Pendragon]]'s eentry}}<!-- no mention of Guenivere being a Pict -->\n\n==Religion==\nThe Picts have worshiped (or at least invoked the names) of [[:Category:Pictish Deities|many entities]]:\n* During the [[Pre-Cataclysmic Age]], circa 18,500 BC. they invoked the names of (among others) the [[Gaea (Earth-616)|Great Mother Danu]],{{r|Kull the Conqueror Vol 2 2}} the [[Sea-Gods]], the [[Gods of the Waves]], the [[Great War Chief (Picts) (Earth-616)|Great War Chief]],{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #47}} the [[Sky Gods (Picts) (Earth-616)|Sky Gods]],<!-- {{r|Kull the Conqueror Vol 3 4|; Brule's Tale}} --> and [[Valka (Earth-616)|Valka]],{{r|Kull the Conqueror Vol 3 4|; Brule's Tale}}<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #14|; A Kull Glossary: Valka's entry}} --> chief deity of Pre-Cataclysmic Age.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #14|; A Kull Glossary: Valka's entry}}\n* During the [[Hyborian Age]]<!-- ...{{citation}} incomplete: major cults of the Picts. -->, [[Brule (Earth-616)|Brule, the Spear-Slayer]], became the only god left of his descendants, a party of Picts led by [[Brogar (Earth-616)|Brogar]], and was also known as the Dark God.{{r|Savage Tales #4|; Night of the Dark God}}<!-- \n* Circa 200 A.D., ...{{citation}} -->\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * The Picts and [[Caledonians]] were erroneously stated to be [[Celts]] in the [[United Kingdom]]'s entry in {{cl|Marvel Atlas #1}}.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [[Wikipedia:Picts|Picts on wikipedia]]\n}}\n[[Category:Tribes]]\n[[Category:Picts]]\n[[Category:Empires and Civilizations]]\n[[Category:Barbarians]]"
