It was an incredibly powerful force, which has laid waste to galaxies, slaughtered numerous worlds, and has captured or killed cosmic beings.{{r|Annihilation: Nova Vol 1 4}}{{r|Annihilation Vol 1 1|4}}{{r|Thanos: The Infinity Finale Vol 1 1}} It was both an armada with thousands of starships and an army with countless \"bugs\". Nearly a decade after the first Annihilation Wave, the latest Annihilation Wave had over 15,500 warships. It was an armada that consisted of 7,467 dreadnoughts, 4,678 destroyers, and 3,541 cruisers. Each of these warships carried a well-trained Annihilation Wave battalion.{{r|Thanos: The Infinity Relativity Vol 1 1}} \n\nThe Annihilation Wave has also been supported by interstellar mobile planet destroying weapons.{{r|Annihilation: Super-Skrull Vol 1 1|4}}{{r|Annihilation Vol 1|4}}{{r|Thanos: The Infinity Finale Vol 1 1}} Though it had advanced technology (e.g. computers, energy weapons, force fields, etc), it's technology was in most cases inferior to those of the galactic powers of known space. It's advantage was in numbers, with which it overwhelmed opposing forces.{{r|Thanos: The Infinity Relativity Vol 1 1}}\n| History                 = \n===Annihilation War===\nThe Annihilation Wave was [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]]' galactic invading army.{{r|Annihilation: Prologue Vol 1 1}} On the first day (Annihilation Day), the Annihilation Wave slaughtered a million worlds.{{r|Annihilation: Nova Vol 1 4}} It was an army that consisted of at least 5 core fleets led by [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]], [[Salo (Earth-616)|Admiral Salo]], and each of the three queens ([[Eradica (Earth-616)|Eradica]], [[Extirpia (Earth-616)|Extirpia]], and [[Extermina (Earth-616)|Extermina]]). The army was equipped with planetoid-sized warships and the planet destroying [[Harvester of Sorrow]].{{r|Annihilation: Nova Vol 1 3|4}}{{r|Annihilation: Super-Skrull Vol 1 1}} It was a force that possessed not only advanced technology and formidable firepower, but also the advantage of numbers.{{r|Annihilation: Prologue Vol 1 1}}\n===Conquest of Known Space===\nWhen Annihilus attempted once again to conquer the positive universe nearly a decade later, he assembled a new fleet in the [[Negative Zone]]. Due to the vastly improved teleportation system, they were able to strike anywhere in the positive universe within minutes. In the battle of [[Chandilar]], they opened dozens of teleportation gateways along the assembled pan-galactic fleet and simultaneously hundreds of gateways were opened on the Shi'ar throneworld. Wiping out the combined fleet within minutes and laying waste to the planet's defenses in less than a hour.{{r|Thanos: The Infinity Relativity Vol 1 1}}\n[[File:Annihilus' Planet from Thanos The Infinity Finale Vol 1 1 001.png|thumb|250px|Annihilus' Throneworld destroying world]]\nWithin 3 months of the fall of Chandilar, the Annihilation Wave had nearly eradicated the Shi'ar and scattered the remnants across the cosmos. It had shattered [[Kree]] and [[Badoon]] worlds, and laid waste to [[Earth]]. The Annihilation Wave had killed [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] and slaughtered the [[Celestials]]. In addition to its army of \"bugs\" (insectoids) and the armada, it also had a [[Annihilus' Planet|mobile throneworld]] (complete with planetary thrust engines and a global force field) which could destroy planets with a single energy blast and could open a planet-sized teleportation gateway. They also had created humanoid insectoids which served in its army. The conquests of the Annihilation Wave during the war were erased when the nigh omnipotent [[Adam Warlock (Earth-19141)|Adam Warlock]] went back in time with [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] and prevented the war from happening in the first place after which he took his place as the prime reality's Living Tribunal.{{r|Thanos: The Infinity Finale Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = Interdimensional teleportation system,\n| Transportation          = Annihilus' Throneworld with planetary engines and the interdimensional teleportation system, Warp-capable Starships, \n| Weapons                 = Directed Energy Weapons (beam and pulse), Space Mines\n| Notes                   = * The Annihilation Wave was stated to be a cosmic level threat.{{r|Marvel Fact Files #10|; [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]]'s entry}} [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] considered them (in the scenario of an invasion of [[Earth]]) as a high level threat.{{r|Fantastic Four #588}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Cosmic Level Threats]]\n[[Category:Factions In The Game Of Worlds]]\n[[Category:High Level Threats]]\n[[Category:Negative Zoner]]\n[[Category:Interplanetary Organizations]]\n[[Category:Interdimensional Organizations]]\n[[Category:Alien Military Forces]]\n[[Category:Interstellar Fleets]]"
