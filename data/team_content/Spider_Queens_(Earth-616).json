However, as the accident didn't alter Alpha's DNA, the Jackal wasn't able to replicate his powers in his clones. Having failed, the Jackal activated the cellular degeneration inside himself and his other clones, causing their death.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 692|693}}\n\n==Powers==\nThe Spider Queens haven't displayed most of their [[Adriana Soria (Earth-616)#Powers|clonal source's powers]], but were shown to possess some new abilities from their genetic enhancing, based on Spider-biology:\n* '''Superhuman Strength'''\n* '''Stingers:''' Princess and her siblings had the ability to expel stingers from the mouth. They released a venom, causing direct trauma and/or flaccid paralysis. Based on Spider-biology, they were ineffective on [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].\n* '''Biological/Organic Webbing Generation:''' She was also gifted with the ability to organically produce his own silk webbing from glands located in her mouth. These organic webs had many of the same properties as Spider-Man's artificial webbing. Inspecting them, Spider-Man stated that that webbing was supposed to decay within a hour, as the one he had once.<ref>That's seems to be an error as his own organic needed a week to decay</ref>\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Clones]]\n[[Category:Homo Insectus]]\n[[Category:Multiple Eyes]]\n[[Category:Mutants cloned/created after M-Day]]\n[[Category:Clones of Adriana Soria]]\n[[Category:Clones Created by Miles Warren]]\n[[Category:Organic Webbing]]\n[[Category:Mutants (Homo superior)]]"
