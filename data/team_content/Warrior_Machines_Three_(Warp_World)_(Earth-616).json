They were present when [[Stark Odinson (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Stark Odinson]] requested the All-Father [[Howard Odin (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Howard Odin]] permission to join them in battle as an armor-clad warrior. The Warrior Machines Three stepped in after Stark had an outburst due to being rejected and he attacked his adoptive brother [[Ezekiel Stane (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Stane]]. As a result, Howard banished Stark to [[Earth|Midgard]], stripping him of his godhood in the process.\n\nFive years later, [[Malekith (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Malekith]] assaulted [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]] and restrained all of its inhabitants, including the Warrior Machines Three; using the [[Nidavellir]]-Ring to encase them in bubbles of transparent [[Uru]]. Stark soon returned to his home, having become the heroic [[Iron Hammer]]. When he confronted Malekith, the villain attempted to disintegrate him with a ray of Odin-Force from the Asgard-Ring. Stark evaded the attack using the [[Bridging Interdimensional Frequency Rotating Outside Space-Time|B.I.F.R.O.S.T.]], deflecting the ray into the bubble holding the Warrior Machines Three captives. The heroes charged into battle, but Malekith used the combined abilities of the [[Heven (Tenth Realm)|Heven]], [[Jotunheim]], [[Muspelheim]] and Nidavellir-Rings to subdue them again. Despite their quick foundering, the distraction allowed Stark to strike Malekith and then overpower him, since he had depleted his rings' powers on the Warrior Machines Three, ultimately resulting in the Elf-King's death.{{r|Infinity Wars: Iron Hammer Vol 1 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[War Machine Armor|Warrior Machines Three's armor]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The Warrior Machines Three are a warp between the [[Warriors Three (Earth-616)|Warriors Three]] and [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]'s allies [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Pepper Potts]], [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|Jim Rhodes]] and [[Toni Ho (Earth-616)|Toni Ho]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Infinity Warps]]"
