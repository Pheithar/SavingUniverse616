Disguising themselves as human priests, the surviving Serpent-Men infiltrated human society, becoming the secret power behind the throne of [[Valusia (Kingdom)|Valusia]].\n\nDuring the time of [[Kull (Earth-616)|King Kull]], the Cult of the Serpent was exposed, when their priests made a failed attempt to replace Kull with an impersonator, and many of their number were slain by Kull and his allies.{{r|Kull the Conqueror Vol 1 2}}\n\n====[[Siege of the City of Wonders]]====\n{{MessageBox\n| Message = For the full presentation of this event, please consult the '''[[Siege of the City of Wonders]]''' page.\n}}\nThe Cult of the Serpent would regroup and, moving openly, lay siege to the [[City of Wonders]], the capital city of Valusia. Although the siege lasted for many months, the Cult failed to break the spirits of Kull or the city's defenders.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #148|; Host of the Serpent Cult}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #149|; Traitor's Gold}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #159|; The Plague King}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #213|; Conscience of the King}}\n\n===[[Modern Age]]===\nAlthough driven back into the shadows, the Cult of the Serpent survived into the modern era. With the Serpent-Men themselves all but extinct and driven into a limbo dimension, they relied on human cultists to carry out their orders and to provide host bodies for their spirits to possess. During the modern era, the Cult captured the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] and impersonated them in an attempt to deceive [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] into aiding them in recovering a pre-Cataclysmic serpent totem. With the totem, they intended to bring the other Serpent-Men back from limbo \u2013 however, Spider-Man exposed them and destroyed the totem, foiling their plans.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #111|; Of Spiders and Serpents!}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Setites]]\n[[Category:Setite Clergy]]\n[[Category:Pre-Cataclysmic Age Religions]]"
