The team consisted of Attuma, [[Nagala (Earth-616)|Nagala]], [[Orka (Earth-616)|Orka]], [[Piranha (Earth-616)|Piranha]], [[Jeremy Swimming-Bear (Earth-616)|Sea Urchin]], and [[Todd Arliss (Earth-616)|Tiger Shark]].{{r|Defenders Vol 2 7}}\n\n[[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] traveled to the outskirts of the nation of [[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantis]], they were attacked by the Deep Six and Attuma's Barbarian Hordes. The Defenders then teleported to safety because they needed to create a strategy first.{{r|Defenders Vol 2 7}}\n\nAfter a couple of days, the Defenders returned to deal with the threat. The heroes utilized a strategy of keeping Attuma and Nagala busy, while the other team members could be defeated much more easily. [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] refused to follow the plan and confronted Orka alone, but the rest of the team followed orders.{{r|Defenders Vol 2 11}}\n\nThe Defenders defeated Piranha, Sea Urichin, and Tiger Shark all relatively easily. Nagala was left, but she was stopped by the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] and was knocked unconscious. Namor confronted Attuma alone and beat him in single contact. Deep Six apparently decided to disband not long after this battle.{{r|Defenders Vol 2 11}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Sea Urchin Armor]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/deepsixattuma.htm\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Six_(Marvel_Comics)\n}}"
