The symbiotes' touch proved caustic to the minuscule dimension and its inhabitants, and nearly wound up destroying it and all existence; but they were repelled by the [[Redeemer (Microverse) (Earth-616)|Enigma Force's avatar]].{{r|Venom Vol 2 26|27}}{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 11}}\n\n[[File:Knull Marvel Tales Vol 1 1 Unknown Comic Books Exclusive Virgin Variant.jpg|thumb|left|Knull's dark army]]\nKnull's control over the symbiotes was severed in a battle between [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|one of his symbiote-dragons]] and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]. Being disconnected from Knull caused the symbiote dragons to unravel into countless individual symbiotes, which sought out hosts to stabilize themselves. The symbiotes who had bonded to noble and kind-hearted hosts poisoned the Hive-Mind with the Light, leading to the symbiotes rebelling against Knull and imprisoning him at the core of the symbiote throneworld -- renaming it and themselves \"Klyntar\" after the symbiote word for prison.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} \n\n===Post-Knull Empire===\nAshamed of their dark past, the symbiotes of Klyntar desired to spread and maintain peace throughout the Cosmos by seeking out worthy hosts from various species in order to create an organization of noble warriors, the [[Agents of the Cosmos (Earth-616)|Agents of the Cosmos]].{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 23}} However, many of the symbiotes \u2014 including the one who would later become [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom]] \u2014 were bonded to unworthy hosts, \"corrupting\" them with hatred, rage, and ravenous predatory hunger.{{r|Venom Vol 1 158}} These \"corrupted\" symbiotes were cast out of the Symbiotes hive-mind,{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 23}} which took to forcibly cleansing those it captured and executing those who resisted or relapsed.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 10}}\n\n[[File:Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 430.png|thumb|left|Symbiote Imperium]]\nDespite being cut off from the hive-mind, the corrupted symbiotes formed into a loosely-organized spacefaring empire and resumed conquering planets, spreading what the Symbiotes hive-mind claimed was misinformation about their species.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 23}}{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 8}} While some of the corrupted symbiotes took to overwhelming their hosts with bloodlust and corrupting them;{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 8}}{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 118|119}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 26}} the vast majority came to see their hosts as nothing more than chattel and developed the practice of seizing control of their bodies; parasitically draining their vitality, phenethylamine, adrenaline, and other body fluids until they expired; and devouring their flesh before seeking out new hosts to repeat the process.{{r|Venom Super Special Vol 1 1}}{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men Vol 1 5}} As a result, the corrupted symbiotes caused their species as a whole to become once-again feared as one of the galaxy's apex predators, their hosts treated with fear and mistrust.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 14}} \n\nAt some point in the past, Joot, one of the worlds conquered by the Symbiote Hive, was devoured by Galactus, amplifying the symbiotes' instinctual fear and hatred towards the cosmic entity and his herald, the Silver Surfer.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 430|431}}\n\n===Modern Times===\nThe arms dealer [[Haze Mancer (Earth-616)|Haze Mancer]] was an unwitting ally of the Hive, abducting uncorrupted symbiotes from Klyntar, weaponizing them with chemicals that corrupted them by amplifying their aggression and bloodlust, and selling them to space-pirates and warlords.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 21}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 162}}\n\n[[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|The symbiote that would become known as \"Venom\"]] was once a member of the Hive, having been a member of the [[Agents of the Cosmos (Earth-616)|Agents of the Cosmos]] before being corrupted by its original host.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 8}} However, it was deemed aberrant for its desire to protect its hosts, and was imprisoned to prevent it from contaminating the Hive with like-minded spawn.{{r|Venom Super Special Vol 1 1}} The Venom symbiote was later unwittingly freed by Spider-Man, who brought it to Earth where it eventually reproduced - having come to consider humanity its Hive.{{r|Venom Vol 4 20}} Despite the Venom symbiote's increasing corruption and malevolence, neither it nor [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|its nihilistic and bloodthirsty spawn]] made any deliberate attempt to contact or rejoin the Symbiote Hive.\n\n<!--A symbiote later known as [[Dreadface (Earth-616)|Dreadface]] was captured by [[Devos (Earth-616)|Devos the Devastator]], who contained it in order to find a way to exterminate its species.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 359}} Unwittingly freed by the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], it attempted to conquer Earth several times but was foiled and ultimately returned to the depths of space.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 360}}{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 26}}{{r|Fantastic Force Vol 1 5}}\n\n-->\nThe Symbiote Hive [[Planet of the Symbiotes (Event)|once attempted to conquer Earth]], having been unintentionally summoned by the Venom symbiote, before being routed by Spider-Man, his clone the Scarlet Spider, Venom, and Carnage. Almost all of the invading symbiotes committed suicide after Venom unleashed a scream of despair,{{r|Web of Spider-Man Super Special Vol 1 1}} and most of the surviving invaders were eaten by a [[Xenophage]];{{r|Venom: The Hunted Vol 1 1|3}} though one tried to get revenge on the \"race traitor\" Venom and was killed when its host, [[Rune (Earth-93060)|Rune]], managed to break free of its control and devour it.{{r|Rune vs. Venom Vol 1 1}}\n\nAt some point, a symbiote called [[Zzzxx (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Zzzxx]] attacked the [[Shi'ar Empire]], but was captured and turned into a living weapon.{{r|X-Men: Kingbreaker Vol 1 2}} Members of the Hive tricked a swarm of [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] into becoming their hosts and attacked the [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] space station in an attempt to lay claim to [[Deathbird's Child (Earth-616)|the unborn child of Deathbird]] while plotting to use his power to facilitate their conquest of the galaxy, but were repelled by members of the X-Men and Spider-Man.{{r|Spider-Man and the X-Men Vol 1 5}}\n\n====Return of Knull and a new King in Black====\nAfter [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]]'s resurrection as a result of being bonded to [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a piece]] of the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel symbiote]], he began hunting down previous symbiote hosts in order to extract their codices - the remnants of symbiotes in a host's body - and free Knull.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} He succeeded in his mission, making Venom kill him and forcibly making the Venom symbiote assimilate the Grendel symbiote and the codices, freeing Knull. Upon awakening, Knull destroyed [[Klyntar (Location)|Klyntar]] and merged its constituent symbiotes into a fleet of [[Symbiote Dragons]], resuming his conquest to destroy the cosmos.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5}}\n\n[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) and Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from King in Black Vol 1 5 001.jpg|thumb|New King in Black]]\nUnder Knull's command, the Symbiote Hive decimated entire worlds en route to Earth.{{r|Incoming Vol 1 1}}{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 8}}{{r|Web of Venom: Empyre's End Vol 1 1}}{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 3}} However, following Knull's defeat they recognized Eddie Brock as the new King in Black, making him the nexus of the Hive-Mind.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 5}} Eddie's first act was to sentence the Carnage symbiote - which was being piloted by Cletus Kasady's codex - to execution,{{r|Carnage: Black, White & Blood Vol 1 2}} but a piece of the symbiote survived and made its way back to New York.{{r|Extreme Carnage Alpha Vol 1 1}} \n\nOver the next few months, Eddie granted the symbiotes free will - only remote-piloting them if they allowed him to - but tasked them with helping repair the damage they had caused under Knull's control and with maintaining peace across the cosmos. Some symbiotes chose to remain on Earth and take new hosts, but found themselves the target of anti-extraterrestrial hatred and hunted by the [[Friends of Humanity (Earth-616)|Friends of Humanity]] and [[Alchemax (Earth-616)|Alchemax]]'s [[Guardsmen (Alchemax) (Earth-616)|Guardsmen]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}} In the meantime, Carnage began using the power Knull had granted him to corrupt other symbiotes, intending to establish [[Carnage's Hive (Earth-616)|a rival Hive]] with himself as the deified nexus and ultimately dethrone Eddie.{{r|Extreme Carnage Alpha Vol 1 1}}{{r|Extreme Carnage: Scream Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = The Symbiote Hive possesses an array of technology obtained from conquered species, which they can use to construct warp gates to facilitate interstellar travel.{{r|Venom Super Special Vol 1 1}}\n| Weapons                 = While some symbiotes utilized technological weaponry appropriated from conquered species,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 430}} most relied upon their fangs, claws, pseudopods, and whatever natural weaponry their hosts possess.\n| Notes                   = * The Symbiote Hive-Mind transcends time and space, enabling the King in Black to affect the past.{{r|{{cl|Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 1}}-[[Symbiote Spider-Man: King in Black Vol 1 5|5]]}}{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}}\n* Deceased symbiotes still exist within the Hive-Mind and can potentially be resurrected, as seen with [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|All-Black]] and [[Anti-Venom II (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom]].{{r|Web of Venom: Wraith Vol 1 1}}{{r|Venom Vol 4 33}}\n| Trivia                  = * The timeline of the Symbiote Hive is inconsistently depicted within the comics. {{cl|Thor: God of Thunder Vol 1 6}} establishes that [[Gorr (God Butcher) (Earth-616)|Gorr]] stealing [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|All-Black]] from [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] happened ~3000 years ago (which is what the appendix at the end of {{cl|King in Black Vol 1 1}} goes with), and {{cl|Venom Vol 4 4}} reveals Knull created the [[Symbiotes]] ~100 years after losing All-Black; but {{cl|Venom Vol 4 3}}, ''[[Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1|Silver Surfer: Black]]'', [[Scream: Curse of Carnage Vol 1|Scream: Curse of Carnage]], and [[Savage Avengers Vol 1|Savage Avengers]] show him having created the symbiotes and [[Symbiote Dragons|symbiote-dragons]] billions of years in the past, while he still had All-Black. ''Venom'' #4 further establishes that Knull only lost control of the Symbiote Hive in the 6th century CE, which is when symbiotes first arrived on Earth in the form of the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]] (and [[Big Mother (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Big Mother]] according to ''Scream: Curse of Carnage''). {{cl|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2020 Spider-Man/Venom}} has Eddie state that Knull was imprisoned by the symbiotes billions of years ago; while {{cl|Carnage: Black, White & Blood Vol 1 1}} (assuming [[Lucius Marius (Earth-616)|Lucius Marius]] isn't a figment of Cletus' twisted imagination) shows a symbiote being present on Earth during the time of the [[Roman Empire]], and ''Savage Avengers'' shows a symbiote being present on Earth in the [[Hyborian Age]] - roughly 10 000 years before present.\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Interplanetary Organizations]]\n[[Category:Empires and Civilizations]]\n[[Category:Knull Worship]]\n[[Category:Living Abyss]]\n[[Category:Symbiotes]]"
