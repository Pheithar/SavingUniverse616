When [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] discovered the location of their televised interview, they attacked him, only to be ordered to stand down by their leader. After the imprisonment of the Caviar Killer, the $ cult was never seen again.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n* http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/caviarkillerdd.htm#cult\n}}"
