They were said to have been incorruptible and pure of heart. While delving into an ancient temple where an evil entity lived, the sorcerers became possessed by it. Their corrupted bodies remained trapped underground for eons.\n\n[[File:Thaumaturge Trivium (Earth-616) from Doctor Strange Vol 4 26 001.jpg|thumb|left|Before possession]]\nIn modern day, the temple had wound up under [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]]. It was explored by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] and his apprentice [[Zelma Stanton (Earth-616)|Zelma Stanton]] in search for mystical artifacts. The possessed Thaumaturge Trivium attacked the intruders, but they were eventually killed one by one. With its host bodies destroyed, the entity possessed Doctor Strange. Once Strange defeated this being, the souls of the Thaumaturge Trivium were freed.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 26}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
