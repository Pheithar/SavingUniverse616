Unfortunately, a failsafe measure from Doom's plan caused every trace of [[Molynite]], a precious Rotruvian element, to be destroyed, jeopardizing Rotruvia's economy and forcing its government to accept Doom's terms of surrender, which resulted in the objective of the Latverian dictator being achieved.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers #15}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = [[Molynite]]-powered firearms.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers #15}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
