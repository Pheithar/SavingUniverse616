When the atomic bomb was dropped a number of Deviants and Eternals decided that the constant wars had become too much and dangerous, they left their people and banded together to work towards a peaceful future.{{r|X-Force #97}}\n\nThe Foundation takes its name from Damocles, who had a sword suspended over his head by a thread. The name represented the danger the group felt their races actions had created.{{r|X-Force #97}}\n\nThe only problem with their solution was trying to create a race of super-beings which could control the Earth, and thus put an end to all warfare. They experimented using human [[Homo superior|mutants]] and used agents to infiltrate various organizations such as [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and [[Operation: Zero Tolerance]] to keep track of existing superhumans.{{r|X-Force #12|14}}{{r|X-Force #68|70}}\n\nTheir experiments produced an entire generation of [[Homo superior|mutant]] children in the small town of [[Almost Reno]], [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]], but the children proved genetically unstable and all but one died at a young age.{{r|X-Force #77}}\n\t\n| Equipment               = Advanced technology from the Eternals, Deviants as well as hybridized technology.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/damoclesfoundation.htm\n}}"
