[[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] (Gamma Flight's successor) tracked down the event, with the aid of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 121}} \n\nThere the [[Robert Brasman (Earth-616)|Brass Bishop]] explained that the energies that had been collected as part of the Sphinx's experiments were now stored in the bodies of the two siblings and the scientist. During the battle between Alpha Flight, Spider-Man, and the Chess Set, the energies pooled into the scientist and he became a new, merged, being. Seeking vengeance, the new being lashed out at the Chess Set, planning to kill them. Alpha Flight's leader, [[Heather McNeil (Earth-616)|Guardian]] convinced the being that to honor the memories of Auric and Silver, it should not kill the Chess Set. Agreeing, the being disappeared.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 121}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
