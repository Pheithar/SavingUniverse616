When he was passed over for the project, and later saw the success of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers, Aka Captain America]], he decided to devote his life to developing super-powered heroes of his own.\n\nTo that end, he brought together 5 people of various \"descriptions,\" and enhanced them with Psionic powers: \n* [[James Sharp (Earth-616)|Coronary (James Sharp)]] was a medical student who could psionically manipulate a person's metabolic processes.\n* [[Heidi Franklin (Earth-616)|Pretty Persuasions (Heidi P. Franklin)]] was an exotic dancer who could stimulate the pleasure centers of individuals as well as tranform her own erotic impulses into a variety of psionic weapons.\n* [[Thomas Sorenson (Earth-616)|Mathemanic (Thomas Sorenson)]] was a genius-level math student who could affect the perceptions of others through \"math telepathy\". \n* [[Dwight Hubbard (Earth-616)|Impulse (Dwight Hubbard)]] was a street-gang member who gained lightning fast movement and reflexes. \n* [[Asylum (Psionex) (Earth-616)|Asylum (Unrevealed)]] was a former mental patient who controlled the same [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]] energies as [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]].\n\n===As \"villains\"===\nPsionex played the part of super-powered bodyguards at Genetech. When the Warriors illegally trespassed on the Genetech grounds, Psionex was responsible for capturing them, and containing them for the authorities. They did NOT, as some might believe, act in any way at all illegally, and therefore the Warriors left them on uneasy terms, but not as sworn enemies. \n\nIn fact, Psionex never considered themselves to be villains, nor did they ever make any concerned effort to break the law or harm innocents. Rather, they were a team of ''very'' psychopathic powered individuals who broke free of their masters at [[Genetech (Earth-616)|Genetech]], and fought the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]], a team of teen heroes with close ties to the company. When [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax]] took over the body of their old boss Furmintz, Mathemanic and Impulse actually stayed and helped the Warriors in their fight against the villain.\n\n===As \"heroes\"===\nLater, the team broke free of Genetech's control, and while they ''did'' hold their former captors hostage, they released them when the Warriors came to their assistance, and went off to lead their civilian lives. \n\nAfter the first Asylum's form was dissipated by [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Speedball]],{{r|New Warriors #40}} her name and mask were taken by [[Henrique Gallante (Earth-616)|Henrique Manuel Gallante, formerly known as Darkling]], who had once fought the Warriors and was a drug addict who became mentally disturbed by his [[Homo superior|mutant]] ability to access the Darkforce Dimension, claiming that he heard a voice from within the [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]]. However, upon his return, he brought together the first Asylum's old teammates as a \"hero\" team. They became media darlings, cleaning up the streets, fighting the [[Punisher]]-type battles which most superheroes are unwilling to be involved in. However, Asylum's plan backfired when he accidentally killed a child carrying a toy gun, which he believed to be real. He was brought in for trial by his teammates Coronary and Impulse, and the last he was seen, he was in jail.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Dwayne Taylor (Earth-616)|Night Thrasher]] and [[Elvin Haliday (Earth-616)|Rage]] had abandoned the New Warriors, and after being officially kicked off the team, they decided to put Psionex back into action. They had somewhat of a brief success as a super-team which \"crossed all lines\" when fighting crime, but the two Warriors eventually went back to their own team. The last any member of the team was seen, Pretty Persuasions was performing at a strip club.{{r|Avengers/Thunderbolts Vol 1}}\n\nPsionex finally resolved their differences with the Warriors when the two teams teamed up against [[Genecide (Earth-616)|Genecide]] and [[Eugenix (Earth-616)|Eugenix]].\n\n===[[Dark Reign]]===\nPsionex was later reassembled as part of the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]],{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #26}} showing great interest in enrolling,{{r|Heroic Age: Villains #1}} and were appointed as the Initiative team for [[Maryland (State)|Maryland]],{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #26}} and participated to the [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] [[Siege (Event)|assault]] on [[Asgard]].{{r|Siege Vol 1 1}} At that time, the team was composed of [[James Sharp (Earth-616)|Coronary]], [[Heidi Franklin (Earth-616)|Pretty Persuasions]], [[Thomas Sorenson (Earth-616)|Mathemanic]], [[Dwight Hubbard (Earth-616)|Impulse]] and a new{{r|Heroic Age: Villains #1}} [[Asylum (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Asylum]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #26}}\n\nTheir fate following the fall of the [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] is unknown, but [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]] thought they might perform as effective heroes, as long as they stayed out of [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s influence.{{r|Heroic Age: Villains #1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.coreyblake.com/NWCC New Warriors Continuity Conundrum]\n* [http://members3.boardhost.com/NewWarriors New Warriors Message Board] \n}}\n[[Category:50-State Initiative]]"
