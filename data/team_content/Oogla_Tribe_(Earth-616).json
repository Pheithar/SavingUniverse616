The tibe consisted of [[Cole (Neanderthal) (Earth-616)|Cole]], his wife [[Jana (Neanderthal) (Earth-616)|Jana]] and their daughter [[Tres (Neanderthal) (Earth-616)|Tres]], and also [[Gort (Neanderthal) (Earth-616)|Gort]] and [[One-Eye (Neanderthal) (Earth-616)|One-Eye]], among others.{{r|Cable #96}}\n\n===Events===\nThe tribe were often confronted to [[Smilodon|sabertooth cats]] and [[mammoths]].{{r|Cable #96}} The [[Deviants (Race)|Deviant]] scientist [[Taras Vol (Earth-616)|Taras Vol]] abducted the three Neanderthal experiment to find a way to increase the Deviant lifespan. The experiment was eventually halted due to the [[Great Cataclysm]], which sunk [[Lemuria (Pacific Ocean)|Lemuria]] and [[Atlantis (Empire)|Atlantis]], and the three Neanderthals were released in the nature, with almost no aging.<!-- {{r|Cable #96}} -->\n\nCole left to take the long journey home trying to find his family. It took him fifteen years to find his way back home, but by then his family was dead. Cole never recovered from losing them, and never remarried or had another child.{{r|Cable #96}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   =\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Tribes]]\n[[Category:Homo neanderthalensis]]"
