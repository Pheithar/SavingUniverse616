They were on the hunt for a group of refugees from a species who possessed the natural ability to materialize their prayers into diamonds. These aliens were under the protection of the [[Ravagers (Earth-616)|Ravagers]], and kept going from planet to planet to escape their tormentors.\n\nThe Raiders eventually located the refugees on [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego the Living Planet]], where the Ravangers had been found by the [[Asgardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Asgardians of the Galaxy]]. Before attacking the refugee camp, the Raiders set up a device on Ego's moon, [[Alter Ego (Earth-616)|Alter Ego]]. This device allowed Chargazel to compromise Alter Ego's behavior, thus influence Ego's actions since his will was susceptible to Alter Ego. Under Chargazel's influence, Ego began to attack all creatures on its surface, refugees, Raiders, Asgardians, and Ravagers alike.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 6}}\n\nThe Asgardians and the Ravagers tried to protect the refugees and fend off the Raiders while evading Ego's enviromental hazards. After Ego managed to warn the heroes about the Raiders' meddling, [[Aldrif Odinsdottir (Earth-616)|Angela]] flew up to Alter Ego and threatened the Raiders into deactivating their device, killing Chargazel in the process. The Raiders then cancelled their attack, and fled.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 7}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
