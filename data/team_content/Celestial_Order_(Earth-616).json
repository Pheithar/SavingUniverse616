[[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]], who had acquired omnipotence when he absorbed the Heart's energy, went back in time to this point and caused their spaceship's generator to overheat and explode, killing them all before they could reach the Heart. To make sure that their race would never follow their steps, Thanos spread a black curse within them, killing them all in less than a week.{{r|Marvel Universe: The End Vol 1 4}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Alien Religions]]"
