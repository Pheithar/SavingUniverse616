The [[Dweller-in-Darkness (Earth-616)|Dweller-In-Darkness]] summoned the others to join him in causing 'The Great Fear' to take over Earth. The [[Straw Man (Earth-616)|Straw Man]] warned them that he considered the Earth his home. He alerted [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] to their plot, asking Strange to appear on his \"Horror TV\" station. Strange consulted the [[Book of the Vishanti]] and began preparing with [[Clea (Earth-616)|Clea]] and [[Rintrah (Earth-616)|Rintrah]] for their attack.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #31|33}}\n\nThe [[Lurking Unknown (Earth-616)|Lurking Unknown]] attacked the Straw Man, setting him on fire. But he, [[Kkallakku (Earth-616)|Kkallakku]], and [[Nox (Earth-616)|Nox]] were defeated by Strange, Clea, and Rintrah.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #38|39}}\n\n[[D'Spayre (Earth-616)|D'Spayre]] then challenged the Dweller in Darkness and [[Nightmare (Earth-616)|Nightmare]] to try and out do one another, offering to assist the victor. In actuality, their combined torment caused human despair which empowered [[D'Spayre (Earth-616)|D'Spayre]]. Nightmare and Dweller in Darkness fled. A 'man without fear' was needed, so [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] was summoned by the Straw Man (who had formed another body) to help the others. They managed to defeat D'Spayre.{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #40}}\n\n...{{r|Journey into Mystery #633}}{{r|Journey into Mystery #636}}{{r|Journey into Mystery #645}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Demonic Organizations]]"
