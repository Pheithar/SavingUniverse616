Vol 3 1|2}} Their name, ''Death's Head'', was based on Strucker's personal commando during the [[World War II]], the original [[Death's Head Squadron (Nazi) (Earth-616)|Death's Head Squadron]].{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 5}}\n\nAccording to themselves, the [[Gnobians]] were a specie of aliens discovered by Baron von Strucker and [[Wilhelm Schmidt (Earth-616)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] near the village of [[Gruenstadt]] in [[Germany]], 1944.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3|5}} They helped Strucker building his future [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] empire by giving him their advanced technology, which eventually led to the creations of the [[Life-Model Decoy|Life-Model Decoys]] and the [[Deltite (Earth-616)|Deltites]].{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 4|5}}\n\nIt was eventually revealed that the events of Gruenstadt have never happened and that the Gnobians were advanced [[Life-Model Decoy|LMDs]], unaware of their real origins and possibly had implanted memories, created by [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]] under Baron Strucker's orders.{{r|Fury #1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Hydra (Earth-616)/Members]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Hydra Projects]]\n[[Category:German Organizations]]"
