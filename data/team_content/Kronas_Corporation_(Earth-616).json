He named his new operation '''Kronas Corporation''' after his [[Kronas (Russia)|hometown]] in [[Russia]],{{r|Captain America Vol 5 5}} and financed it by selling a cache of superhuman artifacts he had looted from the archives of the K.G.B.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 1}}{{r|Captain America Vol 5 4}}\n\nWhile Kronas was a successful venture in Russia,  it gained global relevancy when Lukin, who was President{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #9}} and Chief Executive Officer,{{r|Captain America Vol 5 33}} gained possession of the [[Cosmic Cube]].{{r|Captain America Vol 5 1}} He used its reality-warping powers to exponentially increase the company's wealth, allowing it to perform a hostile takeovers of numerous other companies including American oil conglomerate [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon Energy Corporation]]. These new acquisitions afforded increased protection against prosecution in the United States.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 4}}\n\nUpon acquiring the Roxxon Energy Corporation, Kronas Corporation then estabilished its american headquarters at the [[One Roxxon Plaza]] in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Financial District]],{{r|Captain America Vol 5 4}} dismantling the Roxxon Board of Directors and having Roxxon President [[Don Kaminski (Earth-616)|Don Kaminski]] instead report directly to Lukin.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 2 6}} After a [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]]-controlled Aleksander Lukin faked his death in a jet explosion,{{r|Captain America Vol 5 33}} [[Vladmir Morovin (Earth-616)|Vladmir Morovin]] replaced him as C.E.O., although Morovin was later revealed to be an highly advanced hologram controlled by Lukin himself.{{r|Captain America Vol 5 35}} Following Lukin's actual death,{{r|Captain America Vol 5 42}} Roxxon started to secretly control its now leaderless parent company{{r|Dark Reign Files #1}} until it was able to break free from Kronas' ownership, establishing an independent '''Roxxon Energy Corporation''' led by newly appointed Chief Executive Officer [[Dario Agger (Earth-616)|Dario Agger]].{{r|Thor: God of Thunder Vol 1 19.NOW}}\n\nAfter [[Aleksander Lukin (Earth-616)|Aleksander Lukin]] was brought back from the dead by his wife, [[Alexa Lukin (Earth-616)|Alexa]],{{r|Captain America Vol 9 5}} he contacted his long-time friend and Kronas executive, [[Leon (Kronas Corporation) (Earth-616)|Leon]], who reintroduced Lukinto the [[Kronas Corporation Board of Directors (Earth-616)|Board of Directors]] of the rebranded '''Kronos Corporation'''. It is possible that Lukin subsequently regained his role as President and Chief Executive Officer of the company.{{r|Captain America Vol 9 10}}\n\n===Executives===\n* '''[[Aleksander Lukin (Earth-616)|Aleksander Lukin]]''' - Founder,{{r|Captain America Vol 5 4}} President{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #9}} and Chief Executive Officer{{r|Captain America Vol 5 33}}\n* '''[[Leon (Kronas Corporation) (Earth-616)|Leon]]''' - Senior Executive{{r|Captain America Vol 5 4|6}}\n* '''[[Vladmir Morovin (Earth-616)|Vladmir Morovin]]''' - Chief Executive Officer <small>(Hologram)</small>{{r|Captain America Vol 5 34}}\n\n===Subsidiaries===\n* '''[[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon Energy Corporation]]''' - American oil and energy conglomerate{{r|Captain America Vol 5 4}}\n* '''Peggy Day Finance''' - Real estate investment subsidiary{{r|Captain America Vol 5 34}}\n* '''Kane-Meyer Securities''' - Private security firm{{r|Captain America Vol 5 35}}\n* '''RockyWater''' - Mineral water imbottling subsidiary{{r|Captain America Vol 5 35}}\n* '''Kronas Energy''' - Oil and energy subsidiary{{r|Captain America Vol 5 37}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:Chinese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
