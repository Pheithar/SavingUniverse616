Who was not only a heroin drug lord but a rapist who abused his own daughter. They recruited the [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]], who was down in Mexico fighting in its underground fight clubs. Telling him they needed his help to \"rescue\" Gilberto's daughter who had been kidnapped by corrupt federales and was held in prison. \n\nIn reality she was being held in protective custody, as she was working with the DEA. Moon Knight learned the truth and afterwards protected her, later assisted by the [[Zapata Brothers (Earth-616)|Zapata Brothers]] (two assassins who switched sides). The [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] himself was down in Mexico, where he slaughtered the [[Molina (Earth-616)|Russian crime family]] which had arrived to negotiate a joint-venture with the cartel. Despite possessing a small army that included at least one helicopter gunship, the cartel was unable to kill the vigilantes. Arriving at Gilberto's mansion, the Moon Knight found the Punisher. The mansion's defenders had been slaughtered by the mysterious [[Toltec (Earth-616)|Toltec]], who later killed Gilberto.{{r|Moon Knight Vol 5 26|30}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Mexican Organizations]]\n[[Category:Cartels]]\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]"
