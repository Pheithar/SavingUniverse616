The spell-wielding exorcist Elspeth Cromwell unleashed them on Earth to attack a family of suspected witches, actually [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]], [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]], and their son [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin]].  Whatever control she had over them was lost when the blood of an innocent, Franklin, was shed in the ensuing conflict, at which point they simply went on a rampage.  Presumably, they were pulled back into the Netherworld, either when Mephisto pulled the Richardses and Cromwell into his realm, or when the demon-lord was defeated by Franklin Richards.  They have not been seen since.{{Citation}} \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Orders of Knights]]"
