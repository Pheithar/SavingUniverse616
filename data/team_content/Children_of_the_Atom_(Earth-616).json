Using alien technology, the group pretended to be mutants and their goal was to join [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|Children of the Atom Vol 1 4}}\n\nOn their first mission, they stopped the [[Depowered Mutants|depowered]] [[Hell's Belles (Earth-616)|Hell's Belles]] during a robbery. After defeating them, they met the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], who questioned why the team hadn't came to [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] yet. They invited them to come, but the Children said they weren't ready and Daycrawler teleported them away as the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|police]] was closing by (and susceptible to oppose the young mutants due to the [[Underage Superhuman Welfare Act|Kamala's Law]], a legislation banning teen vigilantes). During the night, the team made their way to a [[Gateways|gateway]] but were unable to pass through and enter Krakoa.{{r|Children of the Atom Vol 1 1}}\n\n[[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] later revealed that [[Carmen Cruz (Earth-616)|Carmen]] was a mutant, when she was inviting her to the [[Hellfire Gala]].{{r|Children of the Atom Vol 1 5}}\n\n| Equipment               = * Various pieces of alien technology that lets them emulate mutant powers.\n* Pieces of [[Magneto's Helmet|Magneto's helmet]]\n| Transportation          = [[Jason Thomas (Earth-616)|Daycrawler a.k.a Nighty-Nightcrawler]]'s teleportation.\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * All members are patterned after prominent [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], with similarities in powers (or rather technology emulating powers), names and attire:\n** [[Beatrice Bartholomew (Earth-616)|Cyclops-Lass (Buddy Bartholomew)]] is modeled after [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops (Scott Summers)]], one of the original X-Men.\n** [[Gabriel Brathwaite (Earth-616)|Cherub (Gabe Brathwaite)]] is patterned after [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel/Archangel (Warren Worthington III)]], another original X-Man: Though his tech emits blast of sounds, he uses a power suit reminiscent of [[Archangel]]'s appearance to fly. His codename relates as well to a [[:Category:Angels Choirs|choir of Angels]].\n** [[Benjamin Thomas (Earth-616)|Marvel Guy (Benny Thomas)]], a teenager who uses pheromones to hypnotize people, is patterned after [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl (Jean Grey)]], another original X-Man.\n** [[Jason Thomas (Earth-616)|Daycrawler (Jay Thomas)]] is patterned after [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner)]], one of the new, international X-Men assembled after the original X-Men's apparent demise. He is a child with a teleporter who produces the \"bamf\" sound when teleporting, and his costume includes hands with seemingly only three digits (including thumbs) and feet with only two toes.\n** [[Carmen Cruz (Earth-616)|Gimmick (Carmen Maria Cruz)]] is based on [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit (Remy LeBeau)]] (a [[Thieves Guild (Earth-616)|thief]] and [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauder]] turned X-Man). She is the only mutant on the team, and with a completely different power set than Gambit.\n| Trivia                  = * Before their first full appearace in {{cl|Children of the Atom Vol 1 1}}, the Children of the Atom made a cameo in the story \"Race\" from {{cl|Marvel's Voices Vol 1 1}} written by their co-creator, [[Vita Ayala]]. They appear as a group of civilians asking [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]] for an autograph after he participates in the International Science Race Expo.\n| Links                   = \n}}"
