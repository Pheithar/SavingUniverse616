This began with sending a booby-trapped doll to the [[Edward Hutchinson (Earth-616)|Undersecretary Edward Hutchinson]]'s home on Christmas.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 17}}\n\nThe founder and leader [[Elijah Cross (Earth-616)|Elijah Cross]] recruited depowered mutants [[Fatale (Earth-616)|Fatale]], [[Pantu Hurageb (Earth-616)|Reaper]], [[Nils Styger (Earth-616)|Abyss]], [[Callisto (Earth-616)|Callisto]], [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]], [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]],{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 20}} and also received support from [[Josef Huber (Earth-616)|The Isolationist]], who provided them armory in order to replicate their lost powers.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #23}}\n\nElijah Cross was then targeted by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|FBI]] and [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Cape-Killers (Earth-616)|Cape-Killers]], but was mistakenly rescued by [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]] and [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]], allowing him to flee out.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #17}}\n\n==Against X-Factor Investigations==\nFollowing this incident, they sought [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]]'s aide in being re-powered so they could strike back more effectively. Seeking to use them for his own means, Quicksilver accepted, but only if they would find him a vessel, someone who he could use to channel his [[Terrigen Crystals]]-derived abilities through. [[Callisto (Earth-616)|Callisto]] tried to warn Elijah but her opinion was rejected.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #18}}\n\nLater, [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]] mistakenly entered into a conflict with [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] and [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]] as he crossed them with a sandwich while he was hungry. he beat up Rictor and was then joined by [[Fatale (Earth-616)|Fatale]] who poisoned a dupe. After a brief skirmish, Blob and Fatale fled in a stolen car.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #18}}\n\nAfter hitting a pothole left open earlier in the day by [[Guido Carosella (Earth-616)|Strong Guy]] and [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]], Fatale was thrown clear and Blob was left hanging out of the wrecked car, as they were pursued by [[Theresa Rourke (Earth-616)|Siryn]] and [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|M]]. Intending to arrest the two ex-mutants, they were stopped by [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]]'s arrival, now using knives to replace her powers.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #18}}\n\nIn the ensuing battle, Siryn was quickly injured by Marrow's wrist-mounted knives. While trying to stifle the injured Siryn, Blob was launched clear of the battle. Fatale was knocked unconscious by M. Unnoticed, Rictor was injured from a ricocheted bullet fired by Fatale.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #18}} The fight ended with Siryn taking out Marrow as, still unnoticed, Rictor was dragged away by [[Pantu Hurageb (Earth-616)|Reaper]],{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #18}} already repowed by Quicksilver before joining the X-Cell.{{r|Son of M #6}}\n\nWhile searching for the X-Cell, Strong Guy and and Wolfsbane ran into [[Nils Styger (Earth-616)|Abyss]] who utilized technological whips to throw Strong Guy clear of the battle, Reaper who was trying to transport Rictor to Quicksilver's headquarters, and a knife-throwing Callisto. With Strong Guy thrown clear of the battle, Wolfsbane attempted to tell the X-Cell members what really happened on M-Day but was stopped by Quicksilver, who disabled her with just a touch.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #19}}\n\n==Final battle==\nQuicksilver then repowered Fatale, Abyss, Elijah Ross and Rictor. He offered to repower Marrow, but Callisto convinced her it wasn't a good idea (remembering her own experience with Pietro's repowering abilities). As an army of Madrox dupes launched an assault on Quicksilver's headquarters, the repowered members, including Reaper who had been repowered earlier{{r|Son of M #6}} fought back until Elijah Ross suddenly exploded. As the other members began feeling a heat build-up, Abyss snagged Reaper and Fatale, thrusting them into his Brimstone dimension and following them, in order to prevent them from explode in street.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #20}}\n\n[[File:X-Cell (Earth-616) from X-Factor Vol 3 20 0002.png|thumb|right|350px|[[Nils Styger (Earth-616)|Abyss]] taking [[Fatale (Earth-616)|Fatale]] and [[Pantu Hurageb (Earth-616)|Reaper]] with him to  the [[Brimstone Dimension]]]]\nMeanwhile, Callisto and Marrow learned of Quicksilver's role in the depowering of the world's mutants, holding off his future counterparts while Layla revealed the information. After an unseen counterpart of the speedster managed to stab Marrow from behind, Callisto fled with her to the sewers.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #20}}\n\nThe final fate of the surviving X-Cell members was unknown by Madrox and [[Valerie Cooper (Earth-616)|Val Cooper]], as well as the status of those who were dragged into the [[Brimstone Dimension]], concerning their powers, whether they froze to that step, remained or were drained, and their current whereabouts are unknown.{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #20}}\n\n==Aftermaths and legacy==\n[[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] ended up captured by cops as a vagabond, and thrown in cell, where he mysteriously recovered his powers,{{r|X-Factor: The Quick and the Dead #1}} and later accused a [[Skrulls|skrull]] from impersonating him being responsible for the stealing of the mists.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 31}}\n\n[[Josef Huber (Earth-616)|The Isolationist]] revealed his actions for the X-Cell, and tried to destroy the rest of mutantkind, but was stopped by a [[Terrigenesis]]-repowered and protected [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #23}}\n\n[[Callisto (Earth-616)|Callisto]] relocated to the tunnels below [[Manhattan]] and minded her own bussiness until teenager runaways started showing up in the subways. She decided to bring them in with her and give them a home with her. This lead to a conflict with her old enemy [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], who belived that one of the kids, Angie, was kipnapped. After learning the truth, Storm helped them with their power and water problems and let the runaways remain with her.{{r|Storm Vol 3 2}} \n\n[[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]] was later repowered by Volga at the cost of her unborn child and found by Cable who recruted her as part of his [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]].\n\n[[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]] became a weigh-loss guru in [[Japan]] and the cast leading actor for [[Kingo Sunen (Earth-616)|Kingo Sunen]] movie, but joined [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #500}} He returned repowered by [[Mutant Growth Hormone|MGH]] made from gen\u00e9tica material taken from Dlazzer and back fighting for mutant rights among [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]]'s [[Madripoor]]ian [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 3 #16}}\n\n[[Fatale (Earth-616)|Fatale]], [[Pantu Hurageb (Earth-616)|Reaper]] and [[Nils Styger (Earth-616)|Abyss]] were trapped in frozen time in the dimension, before [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] scientist [[Terrance Hoffman (Earth-616)|Terrance Hoffman]] managed to drag them out using some machine, but captured them, draining them from their energies for his own profit, and leaving them powerless. They were rescued by [[Serval Industries (Earth-616)|Serval Industries']] [[X-Factor (Serval Industries) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]], composed of [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] and [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], but once they were saved, they clashed with this last because of the side-effect of the mists, promising him that they would never forgive him and to take revenge on him.{{r|All-New X-Factor #2}} When the Corporate X-Factor was first anounced to the public, Fatale interrupted the press conference and claimed that Quicksilver blamed a Skrull for his crimes. [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] called security, but as she was taken out, Quicksilver told the guard to let her go and publicly admited that it was he, not a Skrull, who stole the [[Terrigen Mist]]s.{{r|All-New X-Factor #12}} It is unknown if the three of them remained as the X-Cell.\n\n| Equipment               = Before being repowered, Reaper, Abyss and Fatale used technological equivalents of their powers from [[Josef Huber (Earth-616)|The Isolationist]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #23}} [[Callisto (Earth-616)|Callisto]] and [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]] used knives and their training, while [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]] used his bulk of skin.\n| Transportation          = Briefly used a stolen car.\n| Weapons                 = Callisto used throwing knives, Fatale used a poison-tipped, wrist-mounted blade, and Reaper utilized large blades. Abyss had a mechanical suit provided by [[Josef Huber (Earth-616)|The Isolationist]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 3 #23}}\n\n| Notes                   = * Aside from certain government authorities, X-Factor Investigations, and Quicksilver, no one was shown as being aware of the group's existence.
