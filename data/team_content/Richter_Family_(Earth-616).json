It was well known throughout Latin America and were well connected, to the extent that family members who were arrested were soon released from jail. Their business was in the illegal arms trade, from gunrunning to arms sales. One of the individuals that they did business with was the mutant [[Nathan Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]]. \n\nHe came to their place, angry that the weapons they were supposed to supply him with were gone. The men of the family went to the front yard and opened up on him, only to see the bullets bounce off him. Stryfe knocked them all out and approached [[Louis Richter (Earth-616)|Louis Alejandro Richter]], the patriarch of the family. Who defended his actions, saying that Stryfe was two weeks later and the police were getting nosy. Therefore he sold the merchandise to [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] at a loss to get rid of the evidence. Stryfe decided to spare the family but killed Louis.\n\n[[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]] was inside the house but witnessed the fight and death of his father. He rejected the family business and left when he was old enough. Rictor went back to Guadalajara, Mexico to visit his family and face his past when one of the family was arrested and another one ended up in the hospital due to a firefight they had with the police.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 34}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Mexican Organizations]]\n[[Category:Crime Families]]"
