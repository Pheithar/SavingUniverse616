The show (on WTNH, Channel 8), followed the New Warriors around the western United States, filming them fight super-villians. The show became quite successful, but met it's end in [[Stamford]], [[Connecticut (State)|Connecticut]]. The New Warriors were raiding four supervillians ([[Cobalt Man]], [[Speedfreak]], [[Coldheart]], and [[Nitro]]), but the Warriors were out of their league. Nitro used his explosive power to kill the Warriors, all of the cameramen for WTNH, and 800 children in a nearby school. Because of the national importance of this event, the entire footage of it was released to the public, including a scene where [[Speedball]] admitted they were outmatched and simply chasing ratings. After this catastrophe, it is assumed that the company met it's end, after the bad publicity of kick-starting the [[Civil War]].{{r|Civil War Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Minivan\n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:Production Companies]]"
