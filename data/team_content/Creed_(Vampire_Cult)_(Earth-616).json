In order to usher along the coming of their messiah, the Creed set out to turn as many mutants as they could. They eventually succeeded when they used vampire magiks to create [[Varkis (Earth-616)|Varkis]], a clone of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], from a chunk of his flesh. Varkis and the rest of the Creed were destroyed by the combined efforts of Wolverine and [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]].{{r|Wolverine vs. Blade Special Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Vampires]]\n[[Category:Vampire Organizations]]"
