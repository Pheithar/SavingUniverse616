They made their lair in the roots of [[Yggdrasill]], the World Tree. The Asgardian [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]], [[Balder Odinson (Earth-616)|Balder]], and many others consulted the Norn's wisdom over the centuries.{{r|Journey into Mystery #102}}\n\n===Early years===\nThor once consulted the Norns to learn how he could wield the mighty weapon of [[Mjolnir]]. The Norn told Thor that he must face '[[Death (Earth-616)|Death]]' before he could wield such a powerful weapon. It was revealed this meant the Death-goddess [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]].{{r|Journey into Mystery #102}}\n\n[[Enitharmon (Earth-616)|Enitharmon the Weaver]] studied the woven experiences from the [[Norns (Fates) (Earth-616)|Norns]], among others, and learned many interesting patterns and fabrics from them.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 78}}\n\n===[[Pre-Cataclysmic Age]], [[Hyborian Age]], Antiquity===\nThe Fates were mentioned and invoked during the ancient times:\n* In the [[Pre-Cataclysmic Age]] (circa 18,500{{r|Kull the Conqueror Vol 2 2}} and 18,000 BC).{{r|Sub-Mariner #63|; Tales of Atlantis: Cataclysm!}}\n* In the [[Hyborian Age]] (circa 10,000 BC) (as the Fates{{r|King Conan #2}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #23|; Wizards of the Black Sun}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #73|; Island of Pirate's Doom}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #79|; Island of Pirates' Doom Part VI}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #94|; Death Dwarves of Stygia!}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #108|; The Fear of Crom!}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #172|; Swarm of the Bogwitch}} and as the Norns).{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #150|; Call to the Slain}}\n* Circa 1st century AD.{{r|Epic Illustrated #12|; Royal Hunt}}\n\n===[[Modern Age]]===\nThe Fates/Norns met with [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Brunnhilde]], who had just arrived at [[Asgard (Realm)|Asgard]]. They led her to the [[Well of Mimir]] and revealed to her visions of an upcoming future. The visions involved [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]] at war with a rival, civil war in [[Valhalla (Afterlife)|Valhalla]], death decimating mankind and claiming Valkyrie's fellow [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]], and Valkyrie herself banished to [[Niffleheim]]. The Norns claimed that this future could not be prevented.{{r|Defenders #66}}\n\n====Final Ragnarok====\nDuring the final [[Ragnarok (Event)|Ragnarok]], Thor confronted the Norns who had learned that their powers were given to them by [[Those Who Sit Above in Shadow (Earth-616)|Those Who Sit Above In Shadow]] so they could manipulate the destiny of the Asgardians and trigger constant Ragnaroks to feed Those Who Sit Above in Shadow. Wanting to end the continuous Ragnarok cycles the Asgardians were subjected to, Thor ripped apart the [[Loom of the Fates]], destroying everyone within Asgard, including the Norns.{{r|Thor Vol 2 85}}\n\n====Siege====\nThe Norns later turned up alive during the events known as the [[Siege (Event)|Siege of Asgard]]. They confronted the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avenger]] [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]] with a request for him to bring about Ragnar\u00f6k. Daken eventually decided against it.{{r|Dark Wolverine #82|84}}\n\n====[[War of Realms]]====\nThe Norns were in [[Karnilla (Earth-616)|Karnilla's]] [[Nornkeep]] when the [[Dark Council (Earth-616)|Dark Council]] launched a massive invasion in order to prevent the Norns from determining the group's destinies. The Norns were separated and able to flee, but Nornkeep was destroyed, and Karnilla killed.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 2 700}}\n\n==Powers==\nThe Norns learned the [[Weaver Magic|Wyrd Ways of the Weavers]]{{r|Marvel Tarot #1|; Weaver Magic}} and knew interesting patterns and fabrics.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 2 78}}\n\n| Equipment               = <br>\n* [[Thread of Fate]]\n* [[Loom of the Fates]]\n* [[Norn Stones]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The Norns may be the same three beings as the Fates of the Olympian Gods.{{Citation}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/fatesnorns.htm Fates/Norns at the Appendix to the Marvel Handbook]\n}}\n[[Category:Asgardian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Fate Deities]]\n[[Category:Pre-Cataclysmic Age Deities]]\n[[Category:Atlantean Deities]]\n[[Category:Hyborian Age Deities]]\n[[Category:Weaver Magic]]"
