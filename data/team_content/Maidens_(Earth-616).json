When the gangster family named the [[Choi Faction (Earth-616)|Choi Faction]] employed the body-snatcher [[Mongdal (Earth-616)|Mongdal]] to compromise patriotic hero [[Tae-Won (Earth-616)|Taegukgi]] and use him as leverage for a coup, Mongdal decided to instead betray them and wreak havoc as he pleased with Taegukgi's body. To this end, he hired the Maidens to attack the Choi Faction at their base in the abandoned [[Alps Ski Resort]]. When Taegukgi's [[Tiger Division (Earth-616)|Tiger Division]] teammate [[Ami Han (Earth-616)|White Fox]] and conscripted ally the [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] infiltrated the building, they were confronted by members of the Maidens after finding the bodies of the Choi Faction members, but managed to kill them after an arduous battle.{{r|Black Cat Annual Vol 2 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Death Cults]]"
