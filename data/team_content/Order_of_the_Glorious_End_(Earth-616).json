They took part in a ritual that sacrificed half of their members in order to summon her. However, somebody subsequently kidnapped her. Death's disappearance made dying impossible across the entire universe.\n\nWhen [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] investigated the disappearance of their mistress, they ended up in the base of the Order, the [[Dwindling Light]]. The remaining members of the Order briefly engaged the two intruders in combat before discovering they had a common goal. The Order gave Thanos all of the information regarding Death's disappearance in exchange for their deaths at the hands of the Mad Titan as soon as their mistress returned.\n\nThe [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] arrived to the Dwindling Light soon after, to track down Thanos, believing Death's disappearance to be his deed. The Order helped Thanos and Deadpool get the Guardians off their back until they could escape and continue their search.{{r|Deadpool vs. Thanos Vol 1 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Death Cults]]\n[[Category:Alien Religions]]"
