To this end, Loki and the Enchantress incapacitated Wanda's mentor [[Agatha Harkness (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Agatha Harkness]], trapping her essence in a tree, and then Amora -- posing as Agatha -- would coerce the Scarlet Witch into joining their cause.\n\nThe Enchantress formed a team of villains to battle the Avengers, dubbing them the Lethal Legion. Their members included Amora, the Scarlet Witch, [[Simon Williams (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]], the Asgardian [[Skurge (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Executioner]], and [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym's]] robot [[Ultron (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Ultron-5]]. The group attacked the Avengers at their new [[Avengers Mansion]] headquarters, however they were easily be defeated. Ultron-5 was destroyed, while Wonder Man and the Executioner were captured and taken into [[Strategic Hazard Intervention Espionage Logistics Directorate (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|SHIELD]] custody, while the Enchantress and Scarlet Witch escaped. Wonder Man and the Executioner were absorbed by Loki who had been absorbing all the Avenger's various foes and allies unique to Counter-Earth.\n\nAmora and Loki later coerced [[Thor Odinson (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Thor]], [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and [[Patricia Walker (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Hellcat]] into joining the group, the latter having her essence put into the Scarlet Witch to control her body. They attacked the remaining Avengers, however they were ultimately betrayed by Loki who absorbed all the gamma core's energy for himself. The remaining members of the Legion teamed with the Avengers in stopping Loki. Thor and Hellcat died in the battle which ultimately ended in Loki's defeat.\n\nOf all the members of the Lethal Legion, only the fate of the Scarlet Witch is known, as she rejoined the Avengers and returned to her native Earth-616. While many of those absorbed by Loki were released upon his defeat, the ultimate fates of Wonder Man and the Executioner remain unrevealed. Likewise, the fates of the Enchantress and the remains of the destroyed Ultron-5.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Heroes Reborn (1996 Event)]]"
