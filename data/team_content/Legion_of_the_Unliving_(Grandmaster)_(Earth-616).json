A number of Avengers died during this gambit, adding to the Legion's roster, but ultimately the Elders were defeated by a simple slight-of-hand game played by [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], after which the deceased Avengers were restored to life.{{r|Avengers Annual #16}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * As usual with the lineup of any Legion of the Unliving, their legitimacy is debatable.
