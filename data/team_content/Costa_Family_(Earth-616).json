At some point, they got involved in a drug dealing operation arranged by [[San Lorenzo]] diplomat [[Hector Montoya (Earth-616)|Hector Montoya]].{{r|Punisher War Journal #3}} The deal eventually led to the execution of [[Forrest Hunt (Earth-616)|Forrest Hunt]] and the resultant [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Castle]] family massacre (Bruno, along with hitmen [[Byron Hannigan (Earth-616)|Byron Hannigan]], [[Leon Kolsky (Earth-616)|Leon Kolsky]], [[Luis Allegre (Earth-616)|Luis Allegre]], and [[Matt Skinner (Earth-616)|Matt Skinner]] were responsible).{{r|Marvel Preview #2}} The family apparently had connections with the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]], since the investigation concerning the Castle massacre, led by detectives [[John Laviano (Earth-616)|John Laviano]] and [[Stan Witts (Earth-616)|Stan Witts]], was quickly sabotaged by the top brass of the department.{{r|Punisher Year One #2}} [[William Russo (Earth-616)|Billy Russo]] also worked as a hitman for the Costas, on behalf of whom he killed [[Maurice Howles (Earth-616)|Maurice Howles]] (another hitman) and [[Michael McTeer (Earth-616)|Michael McTeer]] (a [[Daily Bugle]] reporter who was helping Castle in his vengeance against the Costas). After Castle, by then known as the Punisher, disfigured him, Russo turned into his nemesis: Jigsaw.{{r|Punisher Year One #4}}\n\nLater, the entire family was wiped out when the Punisher attacked their headquarters in Punta Verde, Florida. Frank and Bruno Costa were both killed by Audrey, a [[Maggia]] hitwoman disguised as a hooker, for their failure towards the organization.{{r|Marvel Super Action Vol 1 #1}} It was later revealed Frank Costa was actually a facade for the demon [[Olivier (Earth-616)|Olivier]], who arranged [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Frank Castle]]'s family to be killed as a means to turn him into the Punisher, whom Olivier employed as a \"soul collector\" until his defeat at the hands of the vigilante and the angel [[Gadriel (Grigori) (Earth-616)|Gadriel]].{{r|Punisher Vol 4 #1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Italian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Maggia]]"
