They took in [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] and [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] after they went to [[Heven (Tenth Realm)|Heven]] to investigate the disappearance of [[Aldrif Odinsdottir (Earth-616)|Angela]].\n\nAfter Thor orchestrated a break-out, he and his allies slaughtered the Ladies of Sorrow, leaving only four survivors. After they refused to answer to Thor's interrogation about the [[War of the Realms]], he fastened the entire prison to one of his substitute hammers and sent it flying into the depths of space, trapping the remaining Ladies of Sorrow inside their own prison for eternity.{{r|Thor Vol 5 8}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
