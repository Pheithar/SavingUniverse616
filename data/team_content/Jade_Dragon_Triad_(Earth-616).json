The organization's activities included pandering, human trafficking, and the production of illegal knockoffs.<!-- {{r|2020 iWolverine Vol 1 1}} -->\n\nThe androids [[Albert (Earth-616)|Albert]] and [[Elsie-Dee (Earth-616)|Elsie-Dee]] broke into the organization's factory where they made knockoffs using slave labor to retrieve Elsie-Dee's arms, which were being used by a production robot. When the pair were confronted by Wu and his gang, Albert took out Wu's men while Elsie-Dee bit down on Wu's left ear for his criminal offenses. Wu later gathered his men to get revenge on Albert and Elsie-Dee.{{r|2020 iWolverine Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe confrontation with the android didn't end well for the gang. Many were hurt or killed when a  gang member wielding a flamethrower was killed and his flamethrower's flaming contents were expelled. Others were hurt by Elsie-Dee when she chose to fight the gang alone, leaving many with broke kneecaps.{{r|2020 iWolverine Vol 1 2}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Buses\n| Weapons                 = Machetes, bats, knives, automatic firearms, chainsaw, formerly a flamethrower\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Chinese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Triads]]"
