They were a tribe of savages who were known for eating human brains. When the cave boy [[Tuk (Earth-616)|Tuk]] began his quest to find his home [[Atlantis]] he would run into a pack of Goreks who attacked him. Tuk was rescued by the Cromagnon man known as [[Tanir (Earth-616)|Tanir]] who slew the Goreks attacking the boy.{{Citation}}\n\nFurther accounts of Gorek activities are unrecorded, and it is likely they are long extinct.\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Prehistoric characters]]\n[[Category:Tribes]]\n[[Category:Pre-Cataclysmic Age Characters]]"
