     = \n===[[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]'s Initiative===\n====Formation====\nIn the aftermath of the [[Civil War]], the pro-registration side stood victorious over the anti-registration and [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] was appointed Director of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The 50-States Initiative was launched, which called for one S.H.I.E.L.D. sponsored superhuman team for each state. The first group of young heroes were sent to 'Hero Boot Camp' located at Camp Hammond, in Stamford, Connecticut, the site of the explosion that launched the Civil War. There, the trainees learned how to respond and adapt to different situations. Before, the US Government feared of the potential of a Superhuman arms race; with mutants being the most diverse candidates to be used by terrorist groups, rogue and hostile nations. With the advent of [[M-Day]] the mutant society were no longer an issue; most of the ones still powered were largely consolidated in the United States. However, the US did lead the world in ''Other phenomena'' that created superhumans. The result, the US won the Superpower Arms Race unopposed.\n\n[[Henry Peter Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Peter Gyrich]] oversaw the entire project. [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|James Rhodes]] participated in the Initiative recruitment and training program and [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]] headed the youth outreach arm.\n\nCamp director [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Henry Pym]] was secretly a [[Skrull]] impostor called [[Criti Noll (Earth-616)|Criti Noll]], who invited Nazi supervillain [[Wernher von Blitzschlag (Earth-616)|Baron Von Blitzschlag]] to the camp.\n\nThere was a special \"black ops\" team within the Initiative, known as the [[Shadow Initiative (Earth-616)|Shadow Initiative]], that reported only to Gyrich. The team eventually consisted of [[Duc No Tranh (Earth-616)|Bengal]], [[Terrance Ward (Earth-616)|Trauma]], [[Frank Schlichting (Earth-616)|Constrictor]], [[Mary Walker (Earth-616)|Mutant Zero]], and the [[Scarlet Spiders (Team Red) (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spiders]].\n\n====First Class====\nAmong the first wave of recruits were [[Michael van Patrick (Earth-616)|MVP]], [[Abigail Boylen (Earth-616)|Cloud 9]], [[Violet Lightner (Earth-616)|Armory]], and [[Terrance Ward (Earth-616)|Trauma]]. MVP was one of the most capable young heroes. During a training exercise, however, Trauma's fear targeting powers accidentally caused Armory to lose control of her weapon, the [[Tactigon]], and MVP was killed pushing Cloud 9 out of the way. In response, the Initiative had the Tactigon stripped from Armory's arm, and threw her out of the program. Gyrich informed everyone present that the mishap had \"never happened\".{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #1}} Later, Baron Von Blitzschlag discovered that instead of being enhanced by the [[Super Soldier Serum]] as everyone believed, MVP was actually an \"\u00dcbermensch\", the ultimate human specimen.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #2}} Von Blitzschlag used MVP's body to clone several duplicates, three of which served as the [[Scarlet Spiders (Team Red) (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spiders]]. Another clone was sent back the MVP's home to resume his life.\n\nWhen a crisis involving the [[Presidents of the United States of America|president]] and the [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] terror-carrier arose in [[Texas (State)|Texas]] required the new recruits to join the fray, Cloud 9, [[Melati Kusuma (Earth-616)|Komodo]], [[Roger Brokeridge (Earth-616)|Hardball]], Gauntlet, [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]], Justice, and [[Criti Noll|Yellowjacket]] all arrived on the scene. As the attack escalated, Yellowjacket deployed the secret weapon he had developed to infiltrate the carrier's shields, a small [[vibranium]] capsule he hid inside of. When he breached the shields, he grew to enormous size and forcibly redirected the carrier to crash, purposely riding it out.\n\nHardball was forced by a Hydra agent with knowledge of his real name to steal a piece of the [[S.P.I.N.]] tech -- a new type of nanotechnology that, when fired in projectile form, could cause a superhuman to lose access to his or her superpowers instantly. As the most promising of the new recruits, Komodo was given an official assignment to take down [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] with S.P.I.N. While Spider-Man was fighting the [[Sinister Syndicate (Earth-616)|Sinister Syndicate]], consisting [[Morris Bench (Earth-616)|Hydro-Man]], [[Herman Schultz (Earth-616)|The Shocker]], and [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]], both War Machine and Komodo headed to the scene of the battle. Komodo and War Machine caused the Sinister Syndicate to flee, and Spider-Man was left to battle the duo. The Scarlet Spiders, who had been cloaked during the fight, revealed themselves. They took down the Syndicate while Spider-Man escaped.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #3}}\n\nWhen the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] [[World War Hulk|returned]] from space with his [[Warbound (Earth-616)|Warbound]], the missing cartridge of S.P.I.N. technology remained undiscovered by Tony Stark. Stark's attempt to remove Hulk's powers during their conflict failed, making Hardball directly responsible for the early failure to contain the Hulk and prevent massive amounts of damage and casualties. Initiative members were assigned to protect the crowd and refrain from engaging the Hulk, though opted to disregard orders and engage Hulk and his Warbound. Henry Gyrich ordered his Shadow Initiative to save the Initiative trainees.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #4|5}} The Shadow Initiative infiltrated into Madison Square Garden, where the Hulk had built an arena to deliver captured heroes for their punishment. It was there where they were confronted by some of the Hulk's Death's Head guards, and Mutant Zero defeated them all. Soon the team was confronted by the Hulk, himself, in which he defeated almost all of the Shadow team members. The crisis ended when Hulk was defeated and placed into S.H.I.E.L.D. confinement.\n\nThe camp's drill-instructor, Gauntlet, who had made several nasty remarks about the dead [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]], was brutally attacked by the former New Warrior [[Steven Harmon (Earth-616)|Slapstick]], who left a mark on his body: 'NW'. Following speculation that the attacker was an Initiative recruit who was a former New Warrior, Justice, [[Deborah Fields (Earth-616)|Debrii]], Slapstick, [[Tsu-Zana (Earth-616)|Ultra-Girl]] and [[Elvin Haliday (Earth-616)|Rage]] were imprisoned and interrogated. When Gauntlet awoke he claimed he was attacked by the [[Ghost (Earth-616)|Ghost]], and the suspects were released.\n\n[[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] replaced Gauntlet as Camp Hammond's drill instructor. Several new Initiative recruits arrived at Camp Hammond, including [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]], [[Z'Reg (Earth-616)|Crusader]], [[Melee (Earth-616)|Melee]], [[Geldoff (Earth-616)|Geldoff]], Dragon Lord, [[Delilah Dearborn (Earth-616)|Geiger]], Red Nine, and [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]]. Taskmaster studied MVP's and Spider-Man's moves, in order to teach the MVP clones, in their role as Scarlet Spiders. However, the result of the previous clonings of MVP impressed Initiative administrators enough to attempt to fill places within the Fifty-State Initiative with further clones of MVP. A new Michael Van Patrick clone was fitted with the Tactigon and set forth, but lost control. Under the name \"[[Michael van Patrick (KIA) (Earth-616)|KIA]]\", the clone went on a murderous rampage throughout Camp Hammond in an attempt to seek revenge for MVP's death.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #8}} The KIA clone caused destruction killing and injuring many Initiative trainees and staff. The [[Mighty Avengers (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]] showed up to help and Cloud 9 and MVP defeated K.I.A.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #11}} However, Justice's team, with the exception of Ultra-Girl, left the Initiative. Justice could no longer go along with the Initiative's lies and cover-ups. He planned to use his team, [[Counter Force (Earth-616)|Counter Force]], to make sure the Initiative didn't abuse its power. He agreed to turn himself in if he broke any laws.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #12}}\n\nHardball, Komodo, Cloud 9, Ultra Girl, 3-D Man, and Thor Girl graduated and were given states to protect as members of The Initiative, along with new costumes. Trauma graduated and became a member of the Initiative staff.\n\n====[[Secret Invasion]]====\nIn addition to the Hank Pym impostor, the Skrulls had infiltrated on each of every superhero team of the Initiative. While the cadets were dispatched to fight the Skrulls, \"Yellowjacket\" welcomed the Skrulls to use all the Initiative bases to create a massive [[Negative Zone]] portal that would take the entire country. [[Delroy Garrett Jr. (Earth-616)|3-D Man (Delroy Garrett)]] joined up with the [[Skrull Kill Krew (Earth-616)|Skrull Kill Krew]] to kill the imposters on every superhero team. Komodo, Hardball, [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]], Cloud 9, [[Greg Willis (Earth-616)|Gravity]], and [[Eric Payne (Earth-616)|Devil-Slayer]] joined the team as well. Devil-Slayer's teleportation ability aided them in killing all Skrull impostors within the Initiative. At the final fight at Camp Hammond, [[Z'Reg (Earth-616)|Crusader (Z'Reg)]], a Skrull with good intentions and an Initiative cadet, killed Criti Noll. Then 3-D Man shot Crusader after discovering his identity as a Skrull.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #19}}\n\n===[[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s Initiative: The [[Dark Reign]]===\nFollowing the aftermath of the Secret Invasion, the Fifty-State Initiative was shut down and the Thunderbolts Initiative was established when [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] took over as director.{{r|Dark Reign #1}} Gauntlet took control as head of Camp Hammond because of his position as the highest ranking officer left. Despite an offer by the Gauntlet, the real Hank Pym chose to leave the camp, as he was never really there in the first place.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #20}} Those that had been replaced by Skrulls met with [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Doc Samson]] at Camp Hammond as part of a support group. While noting the hostilities over the shooting of Crusader, 3-D Man left the Initiative to hunt down any Skrulls still hiding out on Earth.\n\nSome of the latest recruits graduated and were assigned to different teams. [[James Santini (Earth-616)|Batwing]] became a member of the Shadow Initiative, Melee was assigned to additional training to become a Camp Hammond instructor for martial arts, Annex became a member of the [[Mavericks (Earth-616)|Mavericks]] (New Mexico) and Red Nine of [[Cavalry (Earth-616)|The Cavalry]] (Georgia). Geiger also graduated. Camp Hammond instructor [[Walter Newell (Earth-616)|Stingray]] became the new leader of the [[Point Men (Earth-616)|Point Men]] (Hawaii). Because of their villainous pasts, [[Andrea Roarke (Earth-616)|Sunstreak]] and [[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Prodigy]] were not assigned to an Initiative State Team yet, but had to remain under training at Camp Hammond. Since [[Fahnbullah Eddy (Earth-616)|Gorilla Girl]] felt she was typical cannon fodder she decided to go home and be listed as a reserve member.\n\nUnder repair at Camp Hammond, the [[Thor (Clone) (Earth-616)|Thor-clone]] (now dubbed Ragnarok) was activated by a safety measure built into it by the Skrull that posed as Henry Pym, Criti Noll. Thinking he was [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], Ragnarok retook his hammer and went on a rampage easily dispatching the Initiative and Counter Force, who rushed to stop his violent march of destruction. Ragnarok killed Michael, a Scarlet Spider. Baron dismissed the notion as futile, pointing out that while Ragnarok could easily kill everyone, he would not change the fact he was an android-clone based off of the real Thor. Unconvinced, Ragnarok was shown proof that such methods were possible when one of the Scarlet Spiders revealed he and his \"brothers\" were all clones as well. Ragnarok resolved that it mattered not whether he was or wasn't a clone, but rather that his warrior's resolve was true. He flew off to presumably confront Thor and his fellow Asgardians.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #22}}\n\nFollowing Ragnarok's attack, Counter Force decided to bury Michael Van Patrick's body and confess to the world about Michael's death and the clones. This gave Norman Osborn the opportunity to shut down Camp Hammond in his plans to dissolve Tony Stark's 50-State Initiative.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #23}}\n\n====Siege====\n...\n\n===[[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Prodigy]] & [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]]'s Initiative: [[Fear Itself]]===\n...{{r|Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt #1|6}}\n\n== Recruits ==\nMembers of The 50-State Initiative included:\n\n* 5 unnamed S.H.I.E.L.D.
