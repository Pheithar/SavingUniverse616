They were found by the [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]], who uplifted them, taking in numerous former employees of A.I.M. who were chased off when [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Roberto Da Costa]] bought it, and turned W.H.I.S.P.E.R. into his personal tool to reshape the world.{{r|Avengers Vol 6 0}} The Maker's main objective was to remerge the Multiverse and empower the sentience of the Omniverse, [[Eternity (Omniverse)|Eternity]], in preparation for a forthcoming conflict.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 17}}\n\nOne of their first experiments after The Maker's appearance was \"Life-Minus,\" which consisted of capturing the souls of the dead in crystals, creating a new form of life.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 2}} The Maker unleashed the [[Evald Skorpion (Earth-616)|Neohedron]] in [[Paris (France)|Paris]], where it proceeded to use a higher-dimensional frequency to turn people's heads into crystals for the dead to control their bodies.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 1}}\n\nThe [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] of [[Avengers Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] heeded the call for help and tried to disrupt Life-Minus.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 1}} After they were overrun by the forces of Life-Minus, A.I.M.'s scientists discovered what caused Life-Minus. [[V\u00edctor \u00c1lvarez (Earth-616)|Power Man]] used his chi-hearing to find the counter-frequency for the souls of the dead's, which was telepathically transmitted to [[Melissa Gold (Earth-616)|Songbird]] by [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]]. Using the [[Avenger One]]'s loudspeakers, Songbrid's scream was scattered across all of Paris, shattering the crystals and bringing people back to normal.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 2}}\n\nAnother of the Maker's experiments involved finding the ghosts of previous forms of the universe. He accidentally unleashed [[Moridun (Earth-616)|Mor-I-Dun]] of the Fifth Cosmos into the universe after calling him.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 2}}\n\nThe Maker subsequently sent W.H.I.S.P.E.R. agents to steal advanced processors from [[Tokyo]]. The New Avengers stopped them,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 5}} but the Maker took advantage of the situation to infect the heroes with self-replicating nano-cameras that they unwittingly brought to their base, giving the Maker full surveillance of their activities.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 12}} Continuing with his plan to take over A.I.M., Richards created the [[New Revengers (Earth-616)|New Revengers]],{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 7}} a group of villains that included several beings brought from different realities including [[Angar the Screamer]], [[Skar]],{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 13}} and [[Paibok]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 17}}\n\nWith the information gathered by the nano-cameras, the Maker decided to initiate his plan to strike against A.I.M. when it became entangled on a conflict against [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 12}} However, the Maker's plan soon fell apart after realizing A.I.M. and their leader [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Bobby Da Costa]] had known about the nano-cameras, and used them to their advantage, feeding the Maker what they wanted him to see and hear.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 14}} After [[Melissa Gold (Earth-616)|Songbird]] manipulated S.H.I.E.L.D. into bombing W.H.I.S.P.E.R.'s [[Weird Hideout In the Snow-Peaked Everest Region|headquarters]],{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 15}} the Maker decided to retreat and leave the remaining New Revengers to continue fighting the New Avengers while he moved to Plan B, that consisted of kidnapping the President from the Air Force One and selling him to the highest bidder.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 16}}\n\nIn a turn of events, da Costa overturned Reed's plan yet again, and led him to unwittingly teleporting himself to a fake Air Force One made up by [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]]. Da Costa revealed A.I.M. themselves had used the moment in Tokyo when W.H.I.S.P.E.R. infected them with nano-cameras to implant their own on W.H.I.S.P.E.R.'s agent, and the surveillance had granted him the knowledge of every aspect of the Maker's plan. The leaders of the two scientific organizations fought, and the Maker was defeated at last. Reed was subsequently delivered by da Costa directly to the government and imprisoned in a special cell, while professing his subordinates would come for him.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 17}}\n\nSome time later, W.H.I.S.P.E.R. agents posing as the Russian Immigration Bureau attempted to take [[Nadia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Nadia Pym]] from the [[Van Dyne Estate]]. When [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Janet van Dyne]] realized they were fake, the two [[Wasp|Wasps]] fought them and won. Janet then called [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Director Maria Hill]] to have a S.H.I.E.L.D. cleanup crew dispatched and informed her about the \"three goons\" that claimed that were from W.H.I.S.P.E.R..{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 14}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * Each member of W.H.I.S.P.E.R.'s Inner Circle is subjected to a painful surgical procedure that turns them into insectoids with a recognizable speech pattern.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 2}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Al Ewing/Creator]]\n[[Category:Gerardo Sandoval/Creator]]"
