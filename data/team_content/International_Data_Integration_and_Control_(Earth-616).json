The faction eventually became International Data Integration and Control,{{r|Quasar Vol 1 14}} then ultimately evolved to religious zealotry.{{r|Karnak Vol 1 1}}\n\n==Corporate Takeovers==\nTheir first known activities included the attempted hostile takeover of an oil refinery owned by [[Ren\u00e9e de Peyraud (Earth-616)|Dame Ren\u00e9e de Peyraud]]. I.D.I.C. resorted to extreme measures when she instead chose to close the refinery, placing a sleeper agent known as [[Luciane d'Hiver (Earth-616)|Diadem]] with Peyraud\u2019s company under the guise of a system analyser. After numerous attempts on Dame Peyraud's life, including inducing a heart attack with the help of her personal physician, [[Doctor Lugash (Earth-616)|Dr. Lugash]], Diadem persuaded [[Lord Burtonwil (Earth-616)|Lord Burtonwil]] to reopen the refinery, and after a battle with Dame Peyraud's personal bodyguard, [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]], whom Diadem defeated by inducing temporary paralysis, I.D.I.C. succeeded in wresting control of the refinery from Dame Peyraud.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 102}}\n\nSometime later [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] placed [[Kenjiro Tanaka (Earth-616)|Ken Tanaka]] within the [[New York City|New York]] headquarters of I.D.I.C. as part of an operation to insert agents into every major corporation; however, Ken decided to defect to I.D.I.C. when it was revealed that the [[Deltite (Earth-616)|Deltites]] had corrupted his former employer.\n\nI.D.I.C. contacted [[Vaughn Security Systems (Earth-616)|Vaughn Security Systems]] and their agent, [[Shintaro Kuramoto (Earth-616)|Shintaro Kuramoto]], met with [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Wendell Vaughn]] to discuss upgrading the corporate security for their worldwide data processing network dealing in microtechnologies. Wendell was surprised to find Ken, whom had been at the S.H.I.E.L.D. academy alongside Vaughn, worked for I.D.I.C. and was offered a tour of their facility; however, Quasar was called away to deal with the [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]].{{r|Quasar Vol 1 5}}\n\nVaughn returned to I.D.I.C. to make a presentation to their Board of Directors, but was once again forced to leave, this time feigning illness in order to engage [[Terminus (Destroyer) (Earth-616)|Terminus]].{{r|Quasar Vol 1 7}} I.D.I.C. ultimately granted V.S.S. a contract to upgrade their systems after allowing Wendell one more chance to secure their business. Tanaka, realizing there was little chance of advancement for him at I.D.I.C., left the company to work for Vaughn instead.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 9}}\n\n...{{r|New Mutants Annual Vol 1 7}}\n\n==The Roderick Abduction==\nAfter kidnapping the Nuhuman [[Adam Roderick (Earth-616)|Adam Roderick]], I.D.I.C., who had become increasingly radicalized, claimed responsibility with a video delivered directly to S.H.I.E.L.D. via a proxy server.\n\nDue to complications regarding the legal status of [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhumans]], S.H.I.E.L.D. hired [[Karnak Mander-Azur (Earth-616)|Magister Karnak]] to recover the boy, and he promptly and violently interrogated a mole within S.H.I.E.L.D.'s own ranks to learn I.D.I.C. were holed up in a safehouse in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].{{r|Karnak Vol 1 1}}\n\nAfter having skillfully if not brutally dispatched all of I.D.I.C's operatives stationed at their Berlin safehouse, one in particular dubbed the [[Zen Gunner (Earth-616)|Zen Gunner]] revealed the location of their messianic figure to the assailant before being eliminated by the enigmatic Inhuman.\n\nNow armed with the new information regarding how the Zen Gunner got his abilities from Adam, whom allegedly, willingly went with the A.I.M splinter cell turned cult fanatics, as well as the name of [[Chapel of the Single Shadow|their new headquarters]], Karnak left the safehouse all but unscathed, singlehandedly toppling the entire building complex with one final blow soon after.{{r|Karnak Vol 1 2}}\n\nPicked up by [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-616)|Field Director Coulson]] and [[Jemma Simmons (Earth-616)|Agent Simmons]], the wayward magister gave them the tip he had ascertained to their quarry's location soon bringing the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]] to a remote structure in [[Transia]], [[Europe|Eastern Europe]].\n\nAs they neared the inhabited edifice, their vessel was soon bombarded by an enclave of similarly empowered religious agents with sonokinetic abilities, all of which were veritably and viscerally dispatched by the Shatterer who found a weakness within their sound wave blast; producing the corresponding counter-frequency through the vessel's public address system.{{r|Karnak Vol 1 3}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Jemma Simmons (Earth-616)/Quotes]]\n[[Category:A.I.M.
