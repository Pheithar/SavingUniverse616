The human soldiers are brave when defending [[Latveria]], although cowardly when fighting super-humans, unless Doom himself is in the battlefield. Doom has selected some of these troopers for personal projects such as the [[Doom Squad (Earth-616)|Doom Squad]].{{citation}}\n\nWhen Doom abdicated the throne of Latveria, he left in charge [[General Karadick (Earth-616)|General Karadick]], whom he regarded as the top military mind in the country. Even though Karadick promised to transition the country into a democracy, it soon fell into a military regime.{{r|Infamous Iron Man #4}}\n| Equipment               = Various including: Communicator, uniform, etc\n| Transportation          = [[Excavator (Doctor Doom's vehicle)|Excavator]],{{r|Astonishing Tales #8}} [[Flying Fortress (Doctor Doom)]]\n| Weapons                 = Force rifle, [[Energy Halberd]].\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n* [[Doctor Doom's robots]]\n* [[Machines of Doom Vol 1 1]]\n}}\n[[Category:Government Organizations]]\n[[Category:Latverian Organizations]]"
