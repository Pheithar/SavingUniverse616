With which they invade the space regions of spacefaring civilizations, patrol sectors under Phalanx control, operates convoys, fights spaceborne resistance forces, etc.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 343}}{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith Vol 1 2|4}} The fleet consists of a variety of types of ships including cruisers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 343}}{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith Vol 1 1}}\n| History                 = When the Phalanx Dominion invaded the [[Shi'ar Empire|Shi'ar Imperium]], the Phalanx cut a devastating swath across the core of the Shi'ar galaxy, nearly eradicating the [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]]. Phalanx warships patrolled the sectors under their control. The [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] encountered a Phalanx cruiser near the Shi'ar throneworld of [[Chandilar]], and tricked it into destroying their ship. Thereby creating debris for them to sneak through to the throneworld.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 343}}\n\nAfter the conquest of the [[Kree Empire]] by the Phalanx, former [[Kree]] space was under control of the Phalanx fleet.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith Vol 1 1|4}} A Phalanx cruiser discovered [[Zak-Del (Earth-616)|Wraith]] and brought him on board. He made them feel terror and was able to escape from their vessel.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith Vol 1 1}} Later a  fleet of Phalanx warships chased a Kree resistance sailship in a fringe sector of the Kree galaxy. Which escaped via a Quantrum Stream.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith Vol 1 2}} This rebel sailship raided Phalanx convoys, until its luck ran out and it encountered a heavily armed Phalanx warship,, but were saved by Wraith, the [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]], and [[Praxagora (Earth-616)|Praxagora]].{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith Vol 1 3}}\n\nUpon learning of the Phalanx planning to use a psychic weapon to pacify the Kree galaxy by making all accept Phalanx control, a Kree rebel fleet headed toward the Kirvati Pass where a Phalanx fleet was massing and preparing to deploy the weapon. The rebel fleet made up of solar sailers backed by smaller ships outfitted with analog circuits engaged the Phalanx fleet which was commanded by [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan]]. In less than fifteen minutes, half the rebel front line was destroying, forcing them to retreat. Which was a diversion, letting Wraith and his two companions board the ship and disable the psychic weapon (Supreme Intelligence). They also helped free Ronan from Phalanx control and shut down his fleet, as every circuit in the fleet had become paralyzed.{{r|Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith Vol 1 4}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Warp-capable Interstellar ships\n| Weapons                 = Direct Energy Weapons (e.g. energy beams){{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 343}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Interstellar Fleets]]\n[[Category:Alien Military Forces]]\n[[Category:Interplanetary Organizations]]"
