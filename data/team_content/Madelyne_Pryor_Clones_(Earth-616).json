The Madelyne Pryor clones joined Mister Sinister's other clone creations in fighting the Phoenix Five and managed to defeat each one, one by one. They also were able to siphon some of the energy from the Phoenix Force, but they all were quickly killed by the entity itself, which reinhabited the Phoenix Five.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 17}}\n| Powers                  =  Seemingly the powers of [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]], So far, They have demonstrated the following powers, including:\n*'''Telekinesis''': They are able to levitate, propel, and manipulate objects and matter with the energy of their thoughts. They were also able to create nigh-impenetrable force-fields, and release incredibly powerful concussive blasts of psychokinetic energies. They once used their force-fields to imprision the Phoenix Five, during their confrontation.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 14}}\n**'''Intangibility:''' They have the ability to phase through solid matter by mentally shifting the molecules of their body around another an object.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 14}}\n**'''Psychic Lightning:''' They are able to unleash destructive bolts of telekinetic energy at their enemies.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 14}}\n*'''Telepathy:''' The Madelyne Clones are also able to interact with, affect and manipulate the minds of other sentient beings over long distances. {{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 14}}\n**'''Telepathic Cloak:''' They were able to psychically mask their presence from Phoenix Namor with relative ease.\n**'''Dilate Power:''' They also have the ability to place \u201cpsychic inhibitors\u201d in the minds of mutant adversaries to prevent them from using their powers, as they did to inhibit the telepathy of the Phoenix Five.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 14}}\n**'''Astral Projection'''{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 14}}\n*'''Phoenix Force Connection:''' They seemed to be able to siphon the Phoenix Force out of the Phoenix Five to a certain extent, and access its cosmic-level powers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 17}}\n| Abilities               = Seemingly the abilities of [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]].\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Clones]]\n[[Category:Clones of Jean Grey]]\n[[Category:Mister Sinister Experiment]]\n[[Category:Clones of Nathaniel Essex]]\n[[Category:Phoenix Force]]\n[[Category:Telepaths]]\n[[Category:Telekinesis]]\n[[Category:Telepathic Immunity]]\n[[Category:Intangibility]]\n[[Category:Concussive Blasts]]\n[[Category:Force Field]]"
