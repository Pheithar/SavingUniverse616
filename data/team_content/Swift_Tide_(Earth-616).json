With members from [[Atlantis (Kingdom)|Imperial Atlantis]], the [[Skarka Tribe (Earth-616)|Chasm People]], and other undersea civilizations, the Swift Tide embodied hope of cooperation and peaceful relations between the rival groups, and defended all of the sea peoples that lived in peace.<!--{{r|King in Black: Namor #1}}-->\n\nIn the 1930s, the Swift Tide discovered the location of the evil relic known as the [[Unforgotten Stone]],{{r|King in Black: Namor #1}} a stone prison containing the evil power, if not the very souls, of the [[Great Old Ones]],{{r|King in Black: Namor #2}} and brought word of it to a diplomatic meeting between the Chasm People and Atlantis, helping fend off an assassination attempt on the political leaders and government officials by Chasm People rebels. [[Attukar (Earth-616)|King Attukar]] of the Chasm People and [[Krang (Earth-616)|Warlord Krang]] of the Atlantean Empire decided to send the Swift Tide on a mission to retrieve and dispose of the Unforgotten Stone before it could be discovered by [[Homo sapiens|humans]]; and assigned Prince [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] of the Atlantean Empire and Prince [[Attuma (Earth-616)|Attuma]] of the Chasm People to accompany them hoping to encourage a friendship between the two princes and thereby ease political tensions between their peoples.{{r|King in Black: Namor #1}}\n\nThe expedition uncovered that the Unforgotten Stone had been stolen by Soviet scientists and the [[Thule Society (Earth-616)|Thule Society]], who unwittingly activated it. Engulfed by its eldritch power, the Swift Tide were corrupted and fused with their mounts to become predatory monsters resembling [[Fishmen|Deep Ones]].{{r|King in Black #2}} Renaming themselves the Black Tide, they slaughtered the Chasm People present at the the diplomatic meeting - including King Attukar - and rampaged until they were subdued and exiled to the depths of the [[Mariana Trench]],{{r|King in Black: Namor #1}}{{r|King in Black: Namor Vol 1 3}} where they lay dormant until approached by Namor, who sought to recruit them to fend off [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]'s invasion of [[Earth]].{{r|King in Black #2}}\n\nAs Namor had feared, following Knull's defeat the Black Tide refused to return to exile and disappeared, leading to Namor's [[Defenders of the Deep (Earth-616)|Defenders of the Deep]] hunting them down.{{r|King in Black: Namor #3}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Each of the members of the Swift Tide had a personalized mount. The Unforgotten Stone merged each of them with their mounts - replacing Kharsa's legs with sharklike fins, Sycorax's lower body with tentacles, Sweet Mercy's limbs with blades, and Garanna's lower body with that of her ray.{{r|King in Black: Namor Vol 1 3}}\n| Weapons                 = [[Kharsa (Earth-616)|Captain Kharsa]]'s sword, [[Sycorax (Earth-616)|Sycorax]]'s magic, [[Garanna (Earth-616)|Garanna]]'s club; claws and fangs as the Black Tide. As a member of the Black Tide, the Mountain was turned into a creature comprised of living lava.{{r|King in Black: Namor Vol 1 3}}\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Magic-Based Mutates]]\n[[Category:Cannibals]]\n[[Category:Gestalt Characters]]"
