Down the years, they served the Master of the Winds, which was a hereditary position. It's members achieved mystical union with the cosmos by serving the Master of the Winds. If a member of the Four Winds was killed, another took his place. In service to Timothy Lee, the current Master of the Winds, they were sent to NY City to assassinate [[Richard Malone (Earth-616)|Pig Malone]]. Who was set to testify against Timothy Lee for the murder of a prostitute. \n\nTimothy Lee was being framed by the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] for the murder, with the assistance of the Assistant District Attorney Walker and Pig Malone. Which was due to Timothy Lee expanding his operations outside of Chinatown at the Kingpin's expense. ADA Walker got [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]] to protect Timothy, who did so successfully, killing two of the Four Winds members. She then killed Pig Malone upon learning that he was the one who killed the prostitute and then witnessing him brutalizing another prostitute, thereby destroying the case against Timothy Lee. Afterwards, the ADA Walker was found butchered.{{r|Elektra Vol 2 9}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Assassins]]\n[[Category:Martial Arts]]"
