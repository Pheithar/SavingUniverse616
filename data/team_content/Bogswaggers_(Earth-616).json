Their territory was stolen at some point by the [[Kingslayers (Earth-616)|Kingslayers]].\n\nA group of Bogswaggers were enslaved by [[Morgan Le Fay (Earth-15238)|Witch Queen Le Fay]]'s [[Kingdom of the Torch (Earth-15238)|Kingdom of the Torch]]. They accompanied their master in confronting [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], two visitors that had come to Weirdworld without permission. When le Fay tried to attack Spider-Man, she was electrocuted by the defense systems in his [[Spider-Armor MK IV|suit]], and was knocked unconscious. The Bogswaggers took advantage of le Fay's downfall to break free and rally others to confront the Kingslayers in an effort to reclaim their land.\n\nWhen the two factions were at a standoff, Spider-Man and Deadpool interrupted the conflict and used a [[Dragons of Klarn|Dragon of Klarn]] to help light the rift valley that divided them ablaze, preventing them from attacking each other for the time being.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 13}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
