They confronted [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] in [[Wall Street]] three days after their formation.\n\nNot only were the members of the team easily dealt with, but a new vilainess named [[Itsy Bitsy (Earth-616)|Itsy Bitsy]] interfered in the fight and nearly killed most of them as a display of power for Spider-Man and Deadpool.{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 9}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
