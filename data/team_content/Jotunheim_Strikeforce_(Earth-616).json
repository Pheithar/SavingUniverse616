They continued on foot, following a trail of Frost Giant blood to Thor, who had become submerged in warrior's madness. The Strikeforce fought the near-endless swarm of Frost Giants alongside Thor for hours, costing Arctorius' life, until the monsters were all defeated, causing Thor to snap out of his rage. Afterwards, they returned to [[Earth|Midgard]].{{r|War of the Realms Strikeforce: The Land of Giants Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
