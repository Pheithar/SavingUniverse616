They operated from [[Sherwood Forest]] outside of [[Nottingham]], robbing from the rich to give to the poor.\n\n===Legend===\nAfter battling in the [[Crusades]], Robin returned to [[England]] only to find his father had been murdered by the corrupt [[Sheriff of Nottingham (Earth-616)|Sheriff of Nottingham]] and has taken over his Father's lands. Unable to be helped by [[Marian (Earth-616)|Maid Marian]]. Robin vowed to avenge his father and fled to the Forest of Sherwood, home to a band of outlaws who have been banished from their villages by the Sheriff of Notingham. Combining the forces of the outlaws, Robin and his merry men set out on a crusade against the Sheriff of Nottingham and defeat the Sheriff of Nottingham and his henchmen who bids to take over the throne of England's rightful ruler [[Richard Plantagenet (Earth-616)|King Richard the Lionheart]] and put a end to the corruption that has infested the English countryside.\n\n===Fandral===\nIn the 13th Century, the [[Aesir|Asgardian]] known as [[Fandral (Earth-616)|Fandral]] was being chased by a [[Storm Giant]] through a forest in Asgard when he fell through a portal. He landed on [[Midgard]] in [[England]] in an area known as [[Nottingham]]. He took down a group of soldiers who were harassing the locals for taxes. It was then that he met a woman named [[Marian (Earth-616)|Marian]]. It was love at first site and she told him of the local governor who was stealing from the poor. He helped where he could robbing the rich to give to the poor. Over time he formed a band of Merry Men to help him. Working together he took down the governor and the false king as the true king returned to the throne. He married Marian and they settled in a home not far from Nottingham. However due to her mortal nature she aged and died while Fandral remained unchanged. After her death he returned to Asgard through a portal. It remained unclear if he truly was the inspiration for the legend of [[Robin Hood]].{{r|Thunderstrike Vol 1 18}}\n\n===The Adventures of Robin Hood===\nIn one instance, the 1940s time traveler [[Thomas Tyme (Earth-616)|Tommy Tyme]] ended up in Robin Hood's era. According to this account Tommy showed Robin Hood and his Merry Men how to make sling-shots, suggested that they wear green to better disguise themselves in the forest, and helped Robin Hood win an archery contest before returning to his own time.{{r|Young Allies Vol 1 7}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:British Organizations]]\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]"
