They are at a level of technology as Medieval Europe, but still making them one of the most advanced people in the land. The Lemurians might be descendants of the human denizens of pre-Cataclysmic [[Lemuria (Savage Land)|Lemuria]]. It is theorized that the Lemuran's ancestors settled in [[Pangea (Savage Land)|Pangea]] to escape the tyranny of the [[Deviants (Race)|Deviants]], who had conquered Lemuria thousands of years ago. [[Leanne (Earth-616)|Queen Leanne]] of Lemura was an ally of [[Ka-Zar]] and [[Shanna the She-Devil]], who nevertheless conflicted with them and their \"savage\" ways at times.{{r|Ka-Zar the Savage Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * The Lemurans were longtime allies of the [[Aerians (Beast-Men)|Aerians]], longtime foes of the [[Pterons]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Savage Land Tribes]]\n[[Category:Survivors of Pre-Cataclysmic Lemuria]]"
