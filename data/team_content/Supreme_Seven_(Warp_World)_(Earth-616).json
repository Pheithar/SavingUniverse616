They conceived that their dimension was colliding with that of the Defenders and the more that the cosmic instability grew the boundaries between realities would create a four dimensional black hole that will implode all of space and time.\n\nThe Seven made their way to a rooftop of a building high-rise where [[Hyperbrand (Connell) (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Hyperbrand]] would transfer his abilities in the building's infrastructure turning it into a massive energy construct that would disintegrate the entire planet. But the plan was interrupted by the arrival of [[Peter Parker (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Arachknight]] would fought against them not knowing what their motives were.\n\nAfter a gruesome battle, the Defenders arrived on the scene to protect their fellow teammate. But at this point Hyperbrand was able to channel his energies and refocus it back at the Defenders blowing them away from his vicinity. But his powers ended up being hijacked by [[Gavrill Kinney (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Speed Weasel]].\n\nWith no other recourse, The Supreme Seven pleaded with the Defenders about what could happen if they couldn't follow through with their plan, but as the team questioned the Seven's logic something entirely else had happened, their world ended up folding upon itself once again and merged everyone into more warped versions of their previous selves.{{r|Secret Warps: Arachknight Annual Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = [[Hyperbrand (Object)|Hyperbrand]], [[Sword-Gem]]\n\n| Notes                   = * This team is a warp between the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Squadron Supreme]] and [[DP7 (Earth-148611)|DP7]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Infinity Warps]]"
