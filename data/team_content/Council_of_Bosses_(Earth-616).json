It consisted of nearly a dozen crime bosses, the leading crimelords of the city. After defeating [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]] and seizing control of his [[Hammerhead Family (Earth-616)|crime family]], Tombstone demanded that the council give him a seat. They refused, stating that he had to earn to his place on the council. \n\n[[Nick Kaska (Earth-616)|Nick Kaska]] one of the crimelords on the council, said he would get a seat if he killed [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]. After fighting Spider-Man, he brought his mask to the council but they refused to believe that he had killed him. An enraged Tombstone destroyed the council table and threw Nick Kaska out of the window. Spider-Man saved Nick Kaska and then defeated Tombstone.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 205|206}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]"
