Silvermane uses unusual scientific means only for the personal goal of staving off his own death, and not for the family's activities. Although Silvermane has a son, [[Joseph Manfredi (Earth-616)|Joseph]], once known as Blackwing, his successor as family head will probably be his longtime rival, top Maggia lawyer [[Caesar Cicero (Earth-616)|Caesar \"Big C\" Cicero]]. It is unclear whether or not Silvermane has again assumed control of his organization since being turned into a cyborg.\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Maggia]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Italian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Crime Families]]"
