It possessed great influence in [[Peru]], corrupting the politicians and police, and using violence to kill and intimidate those who were honest. The cartel arranged instant adoptions, murdered the children, and stuffed them with cocaine for smuggling. It was also producing replicas of Mayan artifacts which they filled with cocaine. The [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] took down its operation in Peru and then its operation in [[Belize]].{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 22|24}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Peruvian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Cartels]]"
