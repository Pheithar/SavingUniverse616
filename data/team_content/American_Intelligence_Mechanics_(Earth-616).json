In turn, Maverick made a deal with [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to have A.I.M. become a branch of it working for the American government.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 18}} This new A.I.M. was divided in three sections. The Admin and Research Division (codenamed \"Blue Team\"), the Science and Engineering Division (codenamed \"White Team\"), and the Security and Tactics Division (codenamed \"Red Team\").{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 2}}\n\nFollowing the temporary takeover of the government by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s hand, with the dissolution of S.H.I.E.L.D. being one of many casualties, the new Presidential administration attempted to fully take control of A.I.M.. Roberto managed to save A.I.M. from this change of order by resigning from his position as Supreme Leader. Because the deal Bobby made with General Maverick concerned him personally, A.I.M. severed any ties with the government once Bobby left. The position of Supreme Leader was taken to a vote, and [[Toni Ho (Earth-616)|Toni Ho]] won.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 10}}\n\nNot long afterwards, Toni decided to eliminate the nuisance caused by rogue A.I.M. cells claiming to be the true A.I.M.. To this end she decided to rebrand A.I.M. as a different organization named [[R.E.S.C.U.E. (Earth-616)|R.E.S.C.U.E.]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 690}}\n| Equipment               = A.I.M.
