Many were hunted down and killed. Others were pressed into military service. A few formed a 'mutant underground' in [[Siberia]].{{r|X-Factor Annual #1}}\n\n[[Simas Androvich (Earth-616)|Iron Curtain]] and an unnamed member of the group were coerced to attack [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] at an airport. The unnamed member died during the attack. Iron Curtain was able to explain his actions to [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], who agreed to help. They then attacked the [[Wolfgang Heinrich (Earth-616)|Doppelganger]]'s lab. {{r|X-Factor Annual #1}}\n\n[[Laynia Petrovna (Earth-616)|Darkstar]], [[Nikolai Krylenko (Earth-616)|Vanguard]], and [[Mikhail Ursus (Earth-616)|Ursa Major]] joined the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers (Earth-616)|Soviet Super-Soldiers]] group, but went rogue after a time and refused to work directly for the State. Siberforce offered them sanctuary, but trailed by [[Grigori Andreivitch (Earth-616)|Firefox]] and other Russian forces. [[Concussion (Earth-616)|Concussion]], [[Mentac (Earth-616)|Mentac]], and Iron Curtain were killed by Firefox.{{r|Soviet Super Soldiers #1}}\n\n[[Alexi Garnoff (Earth-616)|Blind Faith]] and Darkstar later investigated the murders caused by the [[Soul Skinner (Earth-616)|Soul Skinner]]. They were attacked but freed by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], who were looking for the kidnapped [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #17|19}}\n\nDarkstar and Vanguard were also sent to investigate the Starblaster's attack on the moon.{{r|Starblast #1|4}}\n\nWith the formation of the [[Winter Guard (Earth-616)|Winter Guard]], Siberforce seems to have been disbanded with only a few members asked to join the new group. The whereabouts of the other members, especially in light of the depowering of many mutants, are unknown.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #9|10}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:KGB Projects]]"
