Sawyer assigned [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] the command of the First Attack Squad, nicknamed the \"Howling Commandos.\"{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 1}}\n\n===[[World War II]]===\nThe Howling Commandos, as well as their great rivals, the Second Attack Squad (the \"Maulers\", led by [[Bull McGiveney (Earth-616)|Sgt. \"Bull\" McGiveney]], with Cpl. [[Ricketts Johnson (Earth-616)|Ricketts Johnson]]), and, later, [[Jim Morita (Earth-616)|Jim Morita]]'s Nisei squad were stationed at a military base in [[England]] to fight specialized missions. These missions were located primarily, but not exclusively, in the European Theatre of [[World War II]], eventually going as far afield as the Pacific Theatre, [[Africa]], and, once each, in the [[Middle East]] and on the Russian front.\n\nThe Howling Commandos' earliest assignment occurred in the autumn of 1942. They were to recover British rocket scientist Dr. MacMillan from a German military base in occupied [[Norway]]. Their success brought the attention of British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill (Earth-616)|Winston Churchill]], who incorporated the unit into the British Army, and given the title of \"Commandos.\"\n\nAfter further training, the unit was dispatched back behind enemy lines in France to recover Free French resistance fighter who was captured by Nazi soldiers. This was a vital rescue mission since they knew the date and time of an impending Allied landing on the beaches of Normandy. With the help of Free French resistance fighters they rescued the man from the Nazis before he could be forced to talk.{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 1}}\n\nAfter seeing combat in a French coastal town, Fury was called back to base where he was informed that the Nazis were getting ahead in the race to develop an atomic bomb. Posing as sailors the Howling Commandos managed to smuggle their way into Germany to seek out the laboratory in the town of Heinemund where the atomic weapons were being developed. Initially captured, they broke free and realized the only way they could get near the lab was to allow themselves to be captured and placed into a nearby concentration camp. Breaking free, Fury and his Commandos attacked the Germany laboratory, sabotaging the scientists works there. After they fled the exposed rods of nuclear material reached critical mass and destroyed the lab in a massive nuclear explosion. It is possible that this set back is what caused Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Adolf Hitler]] to call off any further development of atomic weapons. {{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 2}}\n\nThe Howlers fought against the likes of German General [[Erwin Rommel (Earth-616)|Erwin Rommel]]{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 6}} and inter-squad bigotry.{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 6}} Antagonists included [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]],{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 5}}{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 9}} [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]'s nemeses [[Heinrich Zemo (Earth-616)|Baron Zemo]],{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 8}} as well Adolf Hitler's prot\u00e9g\u00e9,the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]], and other Axis villains. The Howlers were some of the first soldiers to see Captain America in action overseas when the Captain helped them to destroy a Nazi rocket research lab. They worked together so well, in fact, that the Howlers were next ordered to accompany Captain America to [[Wakanda]] to discover why a Nazi invasion force had been sent there{{r|Black Panther/Captain America: Flags of Our Fathers Vol 1 1}}. The Howlers continued to encounter and fight alongside Captain America and [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky]] several times throughout the war.{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 13}}\n\nDespite being an elite squadron, they were in constant conflict with regulations due to Fury's unorthodox command style as well as their constant rivalry with McGiveney's Maulers, which caused the squad members to be thrown into the brig on many occasions.{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 7}}{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 12}}\n\nThey reunited for missions in the Korean War, where Fury received a field promotion to lieutenant, and the Vietnam War, as well as at a present-day reunion gala. Several members of the Howling Commandos have also gone on to spend various amounts of time as a member of Nick Fury's current organization [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D]].{{r|Strange Tales Vol 1 137}}{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 44}}\n\n===Modern Era===\nThe Howling Commandos later became a Delta Force C Squadron F-Team black-ops unit known for always getting the job done no matter the circumstances or consequences. In [[Cebu City]], a mission went bad resulting in the death of a member codenamed [[Randy (Howling Commandos) (Earth-616)|Buzzkill]].{{r|Punisher Vol 10 13}}\n\nIn [[Los Angeles]], the Commandos were ordered to go after the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]].{{r|Punisher Vol 10 1}} The Commandos used the Punisher's contact, [[Thomas Tuggs (Earth-616)|Sgt. Thomas Tuggs]], as bait and eventually tracked him down to his subway hideout. The Punisher almost got away, but a tracking bullet struck him in the torso, wounding him severely.{{r|Punisher Vol 10 6}}\n\nThe Commandos then proceeded to use the Punisher's remaining family members as bait.{{r|Punisher Vol 10 11}} The bait worked,{{r|Punisher Vol 10 12}} and Punisher was captured by the Commandos;{{r|Punisher Vol 10 14}} however, the Punisher convinced their leader, [[Adam Torchia (Earth-616)|Sidewinder]], to free him and stop following orders so that he could get to the bottom of [[Mr. Secretary (Earth-616)|who]] supplied the [[Dos Soles Cartel (Earth-616)|Dos Soles Cartel]] with U.S. Army munitions.{{r|Punisher Vol 10 15}}\n\n==Howling Commandos==\n*[[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]\n*[[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum Dum Dugan]]\n*[[Jim Morita (Earth-616)|Jim Morita]]\n*[[Gabriel Jones (Earth-616)|Gabriel Jones]] killed in {{cl|Secret Warriors Vol 1 19}}.\n*[[Robert Ralston (Earth-616)|Rebel Ralston]] killed in {{cl|Secret Avengers Vol 2 3}}.\n*[[Isadore Cohen (Earth-616)|Isadore \"Izzy\" Cohen]]\n*[[Dino Manelli (Earth-616)|Dino Manelli]] mentioned as being dead in {{cl|Secret Warriors Vol 1 19}}.\n*[[Percival Pinkerton (Earth-616)|Percival \"Pinky\" Pinkerton]] reported to have died in {{cl|Secret Warriors Vol 1 19}}.\n*[[Eric Koenig (Earth-616)|Eric Koenig]] killed in {{cl|Secret Warriors Vol 1 19}}.\n*[[Jonathan Juniper (Earth-616)|Jonathan \"Junior\" Juniper]] killed in {{cl|Sgt.
