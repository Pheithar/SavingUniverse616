He specifically picked  members he deemed uniquely suited to wield a [[Infinity Stones|Infinity Stone]]. After first recruiting [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], Loki then recruited [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] and [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]] and later [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] and the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]. Loki tried to recruit [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]], but he insisted that they stay in the Soul Stone and fight [[Devondra (Earth-616)|Devondra]] who was responsible for corrupting [[Soulworld|Soul World]]. So, Emma used telepathy to call for various heroes to help Adam.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 4}}\n\nThe Cosmic Avengers later found duplicates of the Infinity Stones unintentionally created by Gamora when she created [[Warp World]] in the possession of a young version of Gamora. Using their set of Infinity Stones, the Cosmic Avengers left Soul World and confronted Gamora at the [[Quarry of Creation]]. They managed to defeat Gamora by taking the Infinity Stones from her, but Loki used his sorcery to take Gamora's set of Infinity Stones and used them to wipe out the Avengers' Infinity Stones, banish Gamora to Soul World, and enter the realm below the Quarry of Creation to learn why was he always destined to lose.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 5}}\n\nAfter finding the answer he sought, Loki gave the Infinity Stones back to the Cosmic Avengers. The Avengers then reentered Soul World and rejoined with Adam Warlock. After Hulk used the Space Stone to defeat Devondra, the Cosmic Avengers used the Infinity Stones to restore the universe as well as ensure Warp World remained in existence. They then escaped Soul World with Gamora, [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]], [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]], [[Groot (Earth-616)|Groot]], and [[Earth-18897|alternate reality]] versions of [[Heather Douglas (Earth-18897)|Moondragon]] and [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-18897)|Captain Marvel]] while [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax the Destroyer]] stayed behind to keep the portal opened. After landing in [[Egypt]], Adam Warlock decided to send Gamora someplace where she could redeem herself and then gave the Infinity Stones sentience so they could determine their own fates so no one else could fight over their power.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 6}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Ant-Man's Suit]] and [[Ant-Man's Helmet|helmet]], [[Pym Particles]], [[Biokinetic Polymer Suit|Ms. Marvel's suit]]; formerly the [[Infinity Stones]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The team is only referred to as the \"Cosmic Avengers\" in an editorial sense.
