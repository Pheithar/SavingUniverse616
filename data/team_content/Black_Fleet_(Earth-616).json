The aliens had scattered the fragments through the universe, leaving a self-destructive [[Natter Energy-Egg]] to watch over each of them.{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 2}}{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1|; Chief Examiner's entry}} Whenever a Gem tried to escape, the Egg exploded, destroying itself and the Gem. However, the Black Fleet had discovered a way to disable the Eggs and then capture the Gem fragments with a bio-harness to enslave the Gem's power. The Fleet believed that, once they could reunite all the Gem pieces, they would be powerful enough to nullify free will in the universe and then destroy all organic life. The Gem's pieces were understandably unwilling to be destroyed, but they could not escape the Eggs guarding them, and when the Fleet reached a world with a Gem, the Fleet destroyed the civilization before reaching the egg and easily captured the Gem.{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 2}}\n\nOne planet in the Black Fleet's roadmap was [[Scadam]],{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 2|; Chief Examiner's entry}}{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1|; Chief Examiner's entry}}{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 33}}{{r|Quasar Vol 1 37}} where a Bio-Gem fragment was retained by its Egg in a closed, forbidden museum, without the local [[Scadamites]] knowing about it.{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 3}} The far less discreet Black Fleet was easily detected, however, the terrified Scadamites saw their warship clearly approaching Scadam.{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 2|; Chief Examiner's entry}}{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 33}}{{r|Quasar Vol 1 37}} Although the [[Ruling Council (Scadam) (Earth-616)|Ruling Council]] of Scadam detected the Fleet,{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 1}} Scadamite pacifist culture prevented them from presenting any opposition.{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 1}} Council member [[Durgan (Earth-616)|Durgan the Philosopher]] proposed to, exceptionally,{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 33}} look for a way to confront the Fleet,{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 1}}{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1|; Chief Examiner's entry}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 2|; Chief Examiner's entry}}{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 33}} and was expelled from the Council for his schimastic opinion.{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 1}}{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 2}}{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1|; Chief Examiner's entry}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 2|; Chief Examiner's entry}} Durgan nonetheless dediced to act on his own, looking for a way to fight the Fleet.{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 33}} He decided to build{{r|Marvel Encyclopedia Vol 1 Spider-Man|; Chief Examiner's entry}} an agent,{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 3}} the [[Chief Examiner (Earth-616)|Chief Examiner]], and send it to the planet [[Earth]], where he would analyze superpowerful beings to replicate their abilities;{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 3}}{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 33}} Durgan aimed to later implant the superpowers into a champion who would fight the Black Fleet at Scadam.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 40}}\n\nThe Examiner successfully analyzed [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 1}} and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] while the Fleet attacked another world, assimiliting the Gem and approaching Scadam, and the Ruling Council still rejected Durgan's ways. Durgan's former pupil [[Tuskar (Earth-616)|Tuskar]] defied the Council to look for his missing master{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 2}} and, when he found Durgan, was convinced of the later's strategy against the Fleet and recruited by him as an ally.{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 3}}\n\nDurgan then sent the Chief Examiner to assimilate the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] but, once the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] had been examined,{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 3}} the Bio-Gem took control of the Chief Examiner, locked Durgan's mind up in the Examiner's mnemonic system and went after purported supervillain [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], whom it wanted as an ally. Magneto however proved unpredictable for the Bio-Gem, and instead listened to Durgan's plight, then helped Durgan recover control over the Chief Examiner. Although Magneto agreed to be analyzed by the Examiner, he reprimanded Durgan's and the Chief Examiner's cryptic methods, trying to force superpowered beings to do what they wanted for a supposed greater good instead of offering them a chance to act as they wished - and Magneto even compared Durgan with the Black Fleet on moral grounds.{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 33}}\n\n===Final battle===\n\nThe Black Fleet reached Scadam some time later, just after the Chief Examiner was destroyed when trying to absorbe the [[Star Brand (Object)|Star Brand]] power source from Earthling [[Kayla Ballantine (Earth-616)|Kayla Ballantine]].{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1|; Chief Examiner's entry}}{{r|Quasar Vol 1 38}} The Fleet's raid burned Ballantine{{r|Quasar Vol 1 38}} to a charred, smoked skeleton{{r|Quasar Vol 1 39}} but she regenerated thanks to her powers.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 39}}{{r|Quasar Vol 1 40}} The Black Fleet also attacked Scadamite cities, causing a flow of refugees.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 39}}\n\nThe unconventional community known as the [[Mourners (Earth-616)|Mourners]], hearing the debacle at Scadam, went there in their starship ''[[Mourning Star]]'', along with their Earth-born superpowered allies [[Ayesha (Earth-616)|Her]] -an artificial being- and [[Makkari (Earth-616)|Makkari]] -an [[Eternals (Homo immortalis)|Eternal]]. Seeing the battle, Her insisted in defending the unprotected locals and flew to destroy the first Black Fleet ship{{r|Quasar Vol 1 39}} with her cosmic bolts.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 40}} Her failed to stop the battle, but attracted the Fleet's attention, diverting it temporarily from helpless targets. The Fleet shot Her, exhausting her energy and forcing her to start a healing routine that left her outside the battle for the time being.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 41}}\n\nAfter one week of siege,{{r|Quasar Vol 1 42}} Durgan was ready to release his agent, the [[Chief Exterminator (Earth-616)|Chief Exterminator]]{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1|; Chief Examiner's entry}}{{r|Quasar Vol 1 42}}{{r|Quasar Vol 1 40}} - a huge{{r|Quasar Vol 1 40}}{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1|; Chief Examiner's entry}} piloted{{r|Quasar Vol 1 42}} robot{{r|Quasar Vol 1 42}} with the power of more than twelve superbeings from Earth{{r|Quasar Vol 1 42}} including the Human Torch, Hulk, [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]], the Thing, [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]],{{r|Quasar Vol 1 37}} Spider-Man{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 2}} and Magneto.{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 33}} With Durgan at the helm,{{r|Quasar Vol 1 42}} the Chief Exterminator confronted{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1|; Chief Examiner's entry}} at least thirteen ships from the Black Fleet at once,{{r|Quasar Vol 1 40}} destroying many of them with simultaneous death-rays from its hands and helmet. One Black Fleet ship withstood a bolt, which bounced and almost impacted Ballantine, but she dodged.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 41}}\n\nHowever, the Black Fleet destroyed the Chief Exterminator{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1|; Chief Examiner's entry}}{{r|Quasar Vol 1 41}}{{r|Quasar Vol 1 42}} with eighteen constant laser bursts, making it explode.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 41}} The Exterminator could only have defeated the Black Fleet if it had also the Star Brand power.{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1|; Chief Examiner's entry}} Ballantine found Durgan dying in the debris{{r|Quasar Vol 1 42}} and, believing to have lost her last chance to return to Earth, she unleashed the power of the Star Brand{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1|; Chief Examiner's entry}}{{r|Quasar Vol 1 42}} in a huge power sphere that covered the whole planet Scadam and expanded, engulfing the whole Black Fleet and destroying it to the last ship.{{r|Secret Wars: Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse Vol 1 1|; Chief Examiner's entry}}{{r|Quasar Vol 1 42}}{{r|Quasar Vol 1 45}} The only known survivor was a being called [[Skeletron (Earth-616)|Skeletron]], who would later continue activities of evil intent.{{r|Starblast Vol 1 4}} The Scadamite population had been decimated.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 45}} There is no information about Scadam's Bio-Gem's fate.\n\nHer -rechristened Kismet- and Ballantine returned to Earth, each by her own means, and reunited there -they already knew each other, albeit their relationship was not good. Discovering that Ballantine had destroyed the Black Fleet, Kismet was impressed - Kismet didn't even knew that Ballantine was at Scadam or she'd have tried to rescue her.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 49}}\n| Equipment               = Bio-matter harnesses with which they enslave and destroy [[Bio-Gem (Earth-616)|Bio-Gems]] to store their power.{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 2}}\n| Transportation          = Warships.{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 1}}\n| Weapons                 = Ship artillery{{r|Quasar Vol 1 41}} and personal weapons.{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 2}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Alien Military Forces]]\n[[Category:Interstellar Fleets]]"
