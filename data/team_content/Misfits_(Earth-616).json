[[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] saved him. The Toad then transferred his allegiance to Parker, going so far as to stage an assault on Parker so that he could play hero. In the ensuing chaos, two would-be wannabe heroes, [[Eugene Patilio (Earth-616)|Frog-Man]] (son of [[Vincent Patilio (Earth-616)|Leap-Frog]]) and [[Oliver Osnick (Earth-616)|Spider-Boy]] came to Parker's aid to prove that ''they'' could become Spidey's sidekicks. Toad, Frog-Man and Spider-Boy realized that they had more in common with each other than with Parker, so they formed a group.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #266}}\n\nThe three never appeared together again, so either the team broke up soon after it formed, or their adventures are yet untold.\n\n| Notes                   =\n| Trivia                  =\n[[File:Buford_Hollis,_Charles_Chandler,_Doreen_Green,_Eugene_Patilio,_Misfits_(Earth-616)_from_Marvel_Age_Vol_1_124.jpg|thumb|left|The X-cellent Misfits.]]\n* Another team announced as \"the X-cellent Misfits\" appeared in [[Marvel Age Vol 1 124|''Marvel Age'' #124]], but they never reached their own first appearance (scheduled for April 19th, 1993).
