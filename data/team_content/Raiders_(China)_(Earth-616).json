These Raiders consisted of a set of three remotely-piloted drones. When Iron Man traveled to [[Taipei]] to survey the wreckage of [[Starkdynamics]], these Raiders approached Iron Man to alert him that he didn't have any authority on Chinese soil and that he was to surrender himself. After quickly scanning the Raiders armor, Iron Man realized that these are drone suits operated via remote control. He lured the Raiders to international waters, which allowed him to destroy the drones without risk of igniting an international incident.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 3}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
