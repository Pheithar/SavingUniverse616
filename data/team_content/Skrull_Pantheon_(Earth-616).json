When she found the last Eternal Skrull ([[Kly'bn (Earth-616)|Kly'bn]]) who was kneeling at an altar, he persuaded her not to kill him but to let him be their guide and proclaimed his love for her. The two were elevated to godhood because of the truth of his words.{{r|Incredible Hercules #120}}\n\nIt has not been revealed if there were already Skrull gods before the two or if such gods (e.g. the Skrull Goddess of Love - [[Zorr'Kiri (Earth-616)|Zorr'Kiri]]) came afterwards, and under which circumstances.\n\nThe two of them indirectly supported the creation and expansion of the [[Skrull Empire]]. They conquered and enslaved the pantheons of the conquered races, numbering nearly 1000 pantheons.{{r|Incredible Hercules #118}}{{r|Incredible Hercules #120}}\n\nAround 500 years ago, [[Zorr'Kiri (Earth-616)|Zorr'Kiri]], Skrull Goddess of Love and possibly part of this Pantheon, was murdered by [[Gorr (God Butcher) (Earth-616)|Gorr the God Butcher]], and was missed all those years until her body was retrieved by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] who inquired on Gorr the God Butcher's return.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #3}}\n\n===Modern Era===\nDuring the [[Secret Invasion]], the enslaved army of alien gods battled Earth's [[God Squad (Earth-616)|God Squad]].{{r|Incredible Hercules #119}} Afterwards Kly'bn and Sl'gur't did battle with them and both were slain. Taking the place of the Skrull gods was the [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (Earth-616)|Chaos King]] who, in the form of Sl'gur't, had killed Sl'gur't who in turn was in the form of Amatsu-Mikaboshi (the Chaos King).{{r|Incredible Hercules #120}} When the Chaos King later waged war against the other gods in the [[Chaos War]], Kly'bn was one of the dead gods in her army.{{r|Chaos War: Chaos King #1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * [[Kly'bn (Earth-616)|Kly'bn]], the [[Eternal Skrull]], and [[Sl'gur't (Earth-616)|Sl'gur't]] of the Infinite Names were presented as emperor and empress of their Pantheon,{{r|Incredible Hercules #117}} but it is unknown if other such as [[Zorr'Kiri (Earth-616)|Zorr'Kiri]], [[Skrull]] Goddess of Love, were part of it.\n* To some Skrulls, Kly'bn and Sl'gur't are the only true Gods.{{r|Skrulls! #1|; [[Ethan Edwards (Earth-616)|Ethan Edwards]]' entry}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Skrull Gods]]\n[[Category:Pantheons]]\n[[Category:Skrull Religions]]"
