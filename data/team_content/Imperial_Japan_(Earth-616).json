For a complete history see '''[[Imperial Japan (Earth-616)/Expanded History|Imperial Japan's Expanded History]]'''''</center>\n\n===Preface===\nThe Empire of Japan was formed in 1868 from the existence of the Meiji Restoration, an absolute constitutional monarchy that saw [[Japan]] become a major world power due to it's heavy militarization of the 1920's and 30's. \n\nAs one of the primary aggressors during World War II, the Imperial Japanese army was featured as a major antagonist in many of [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] [[Timely Comics|Timely]] eras of publication with a fictional history that spans 70 years of publication. For a full account of the history of Imperial Japan see the '''[[Imperial Japan (Earth-616)/Expanded History|Unabridged History]]'''. An expanded membership of the Imperial Japanese army can be found '''[[Imperial Japan (Earth-616)/Members|here]]''' while a listing of their war machines unique to [[Earth-616]] can be found '''[[Imperial Japan (Earth-616)/War Machines|here]]'''.\n\n===[[World War II]]===\nBy the 1940's, under the leadership of [[Hirohito (Earth-616)|Hirohito]], the Empire would begin a war in the Pacific an ultimately join the Axis powers, allying itself with [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi Party]]. In 1945, the Empire would eventually surrender to Allied Forces after the dropping of the atom bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. \n\nDuring Pacific War, the Empire of Japan would clash with the [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]], [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and their allies the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]]. \n\nSuper-powered agents who have worked for Imperial Japan have included [[Lady Lotus (Earth-616)|Lady Lotus]] and the Atlantean [[Merro (Earth-616)|U-Man]].\n\n===Defeat and Legacy===\nWith the Japanese refusing surrender after a series of firebombings by the United States, the United Kingdom and the Republic of China, [[Harry Truman (Earth-616)|President Truman]] authorized the dropping of newly developed atomic weapons. Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, 1945 and Nagasaki bombed on August 9, 1945. These attacks effectively led to Japans surrender and subsequent occupation by American forces.\n\nWhile the Imperial Japanese army was soon put out of commission and --unlike the Nazis -- do not have an organized legacy, the use of atomic weapons would create a wave of paranoia during the Cold War era of the 1950s and 1960s. Many individuals came to resent American interference due to lingering hatred over the atomic bombings in Japan. Notably of these was [[Tomo Yoshida (Earth-616)|Tomo Yoshida]] who raised his nephew [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Shiro Yoshida]] (aka the mutant known as Sunfire) to fight against Americans, as relatives of the Yoshida family were effected by the bombings.{{r|X-Men #64}} Possibly one of the most chilling legacies of Japan's defeat at the end of the war came in the form of the [[Everwraith (Earth-616)|Everwraith]] a creature comprised of the souls of all those killed by the bombing of Hiroshima. \n\n==Members==\n{{Main|Imperial Japan (Earth-616)/Members}}\n{{Seealso|:Category:Imperial Japan members}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Governments]]\n[[Category:Japanese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Empires and Civilizations]]\n[[Category:Japan]]"
