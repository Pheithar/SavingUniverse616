They used the [[Pantheon (Earth-616)|Pantheon]]'s [[Mount]] in [[Nevada (State)|Nevada]] as a hideout.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}}\n\nHowever, the Underground was barely scraping by, and the Mount suffered from disrepair. The Underground's attitude changed when hacker [[Rayshaun Lucas (Earth-616)|Rayshaun Lucas]] delivered to the group data [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] gave him. The data revealed that Steve Rogers was transformed into a Hydra agent by the sentient Cosmic Cube [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]] and that Kobik was now in various pieces scattered around the world. The [[Anthony Stark (Third A.I.) (Earth-616)|Iron Man A.I.]] proposed that the Underground retrieve Kobik's remnants, rebuild her, and use her to restore Rogers to normal. [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] disagreed with the plan and later left the Underground to carry out her own plan of assassinating Rogers following the destruction of [[Las Vegas]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1|2}} Widow was joined by the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]] on the condition that they didn't kill anyone.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 3}} A team was put together by the Underground to retrieve Kobik's remnants.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 2}}\n\nThe retrieval team traveled to various locations around the world in search of Kobik's remnants. However, the team was only able to find two remnants before returning to the Mount to rest and to help heal [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]]' injuries.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 3|5}}{{r|Secret Empire: Underground Vol 1 1}} Shortly after the team returned, Hydra led by Steve Rogers began attacking the Mount with Hydra [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier|Helicarriers]]{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 5}} and members of [[Avengers (Hydra) (Earth-616)|Hydra's Avengers]]. [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]], out of guilt, confessed to be being a mole for Hydra. He revealed that Hydra had his daughter [[Cassandra Lang (Earth-616)|Cassie]] and was using her safety as a bargaining trip to make him to its bidding. Hydra finally broke into the Mount when Rogers sent in the newly resurrected [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]. The Underground and the civilians that there staying at the Mount managed to flee thanks to the sacrifice of the [[A.I.vengers (Earth-616)|A.I.vengers]], but the Iron Man A.I. was accidentally left behind. After being immobilized by Steve Rogers and a dying Hulk, the A.I. self-destructed his armor, destroying the Mount and nearly killed Rogers if weren't for the intervention of [[Elisa Sinclair (Earth-61311)|Madame Hydra]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 6}}\n\nFollowing the loss of the Mount, the Underground became more demoralized after learning of the death of Black Widow. That was when Sam Wilson, once again taking up the mantle of Captain America, told the Underground that it wasn't over yet.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 7}} After giving a rousing speech, the Underground became motivated to continue the fight against Hydra.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 8}} After liberating [[New Attilan]] from Hydra's occupation, the Inhuman [[Brian McAllister (Earth-616)|Barf]] produced a Cosmic Cube fragment for the heroes.{{r|Captain America Vol 8 25}} \n\nAfter determining the the fragment had reality warping power, Sam Wilson flew miles into the air with the fragment so he could use its power to remove the [[Planetary Defense Shield]] surrounding Earth to free those trapped on the outside of it while Iron Man and Hawkeye break into [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Sin]]'s and [[Brock Rumlow (Earth-616)|Crossbones]]' super-prison to free the prisoners. However, Wilson was shot out of the air by a Hydra pilot and fell into the ocean. He eventually came out of the water alive and well, and his wish for the Defense Shield to vanish came true to an extent because it awakened [[Avril Kincaid (Earth-616)|Quasar]] from her coma, and she managed to destroy the Defense Shield. During the attack on the super-prison, Maria Hill snuck in and killed [[Marcus Daniels (Earth-616)|Blackout]] to remove the Darkforce barrier around [[Manhattan]]. With the Defense Shield and Darkforce dome gone, the heroes that were trapped by the barrier united with the Underground to stage a final attack on Hydra in [[Washington, D.C.]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 8}}\n\nThe Underground and its allies furiously fought against Hydra's forces, [[High Council of Hydra (Earth-616)|High Council]], and [[Avengers (Hydra) (Earth-616)|Avengers]] before facing off with Steve Rogers himself wearing armor powered by the Cosmic Cube fragments Hydra recovered.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}} Rogers easily overwhelmed the heroes, but he was then tricked by Sam Wilson into accepting the last fragment when secretly contained a shrunken Ant-Man and Winter Soldier. Winter Soldier called out to Kobik in her own mindscape, allowing him to pull her back into the physical world as well as the true Steve Rogers. The true Steve defeated the Hydra Steve in a fight, ending Hydra's rule of the United States, which led to the Underground's disbandment.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}}\n\n| Equipment               = Each member's respective equipment\n| Transportation          = [[Fantasti-Car MK II]]\n| Weapons                 = Each member's respective weapons\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
