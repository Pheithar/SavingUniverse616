Arcade had a variety of traps and attacks laid out for Northstar around the globe, each with a clue leading to the next trap.\n\nThe final trap was in [[New Orleans]] where a band of mercenaries awaited him.  The weakened Northstar was defeated and they moved in for the kill.  The intervention of [[Heather Hudson (Earth-616)|Guardian]] saved Northstar.  The employees of Arcade were taken into custody by [[Tigerstryke]].\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Group was not given an official name\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
