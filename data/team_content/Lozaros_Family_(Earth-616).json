It was based in Staten Island and they were getting into business with [[Viktor Aleksandr Vikady (Earth-616)|Vikady]] to help him bring heroin from the Golden Crescent. They would connect him with those who were involved in the heroin retail trade in exchange for a cut. As they weren't directly involved in drugs but they collected tribute from the drug dealers. THe [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] and [[Dima Alekov Kaganitzky (Earth-616)|Dragunov]] crashed their meeting with Vikady. He got away but the Lozaros in the room were slaughtered.{{r|Punisher: War Zone Vol 1 32}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Crime Families]]\n[[Category:Italian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Cosa Nostra]]"
