Which was used to fight the other two robots, while Yakuza soldiers attacked the [[Sanctuary of Light]]. Their scheme failed and upon being captured, they were brainwashed to forget everything they knew about the Followers of the Light.{{r|Shogun Warriors Vol 1 15}} \n\nYears later, their oyabun [[Shinji Kizaki (Earth-616)|Shinji Kizaki]] was the most powerful and influential crimelord in the Far East.
