The California division of the Initiative was first to be called the \"Champions\", reminiscent of the [[Champions of Los Angeles|short-lived team]] based in Los Angeles. This was soon changed to '''\"The Order\"'''. In addition to its duties, the team was being used as a social experiment: there were eleven members, each with powers based on [[Olympians|Greek gods]], but each set of powers was removable and repeatable. Thus, if a member broke the team's rules, their powers could be removed and another person could take their place. After a year, each member would also be stripped of their powers and code names and return to civilian life, at which point eleven new civilians would replace the former team.{{r|Civil War #6}} {{r|Order Vol 2 #1}}\n\nThe team was comprised largely of celebrities known for making a difference through charitable work, and through a process involving a viral genomech payload developed by [[Criti Noll (Earth-616)|'Hank Pym']] each one was given superpowers modeled on the pantheon of Greek gods and trained at a [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] base in Arizona. However, this process caused great strain on human bodies allowing the users limited time as a superhuman (roughly a year).{{r|Civil War #5|6}}\n\n===The Order===\nAfter defeating [[Infernal Man (Earth-616)|Infernal Man]], some members failed to follow the morality clause in their contract by going out drinking, and were subsequently fired and had their powers removed. Their replacements, Milo Fields, Mulholland Black, Magdalena Marie, and Becky Ryan were given different powers.{{r|Order Vol 2 #1}}\n\nThe team would come into conflict with various villains, most with a connection to General Softly and the mysterious \"M.A.N. from S.H.A.D.O.W.\" military group, including hordes of Zobos (mechanized zombie hobos), Cold War supervillains, Gamma monsters, Namor, and an all girl gang called the [[Black Dahlias (Earth-616)|Black Dahlia]] who had been given superpowers via the same process as The Order by M.A.N. from S.H.A.D.O.W. as well as dealing with a murder case involving a former Order member.{{r|Order Vol 2 #2|7}}\n\nThe team was later evicted from its California headquarters and the M.A.N. from S.H.A.D.O.W. was revealed to be a collection of General Softly Androids first devised by the Super Human Development and Operation (S.H.D.O.) fifty years earlier; around the time of the real General Samuel Softly's death, and now part of a collection of villains (including Black Dahlias and Maul) led by [[Ezekiel Stane (Earth-616)|Ezekiel Stane]] the son of Iron Man's old enemy [[Obadiah Stane (Earth-616)|Obadiah Stane]]. Although Stane's allies were defeated, he escaped and both Heavy and Mulholland Black died.{{r|Order Vol 2 #8|10}}\n\nAt the time of the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]] [[Secret Invasion]] the Order were again functioning as a team, when the Skrull replacement of [[Timothy Dugan (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Dum-Dum Dugan]] announced to the Initiative teams that all Skrull sleeper agents were to reveal themselves and attack. The Order's members were chosen entirely by Tony Stark, with no involvement from the Skrull posing as [[Criti Noll (Earth-616)|Hank Pym]], so they were one of only two teams without a Skrull member, though they did not know this. The announcement led [[James Wa (Earth-616)|Calamity]] to believe [[Rebecca Ryan (Earth-616)|Aralune]], as a shape-changer, was the most likely among them to be a Skrull.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #18}}\n\nThe surviving members of the team were later seen listening to a speech performed by [[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Ritchie Gilmore]] during the events of [[Fear Itself]].{{r|Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt Vol 1 1}}\n\n===The Order===\n* Creators\n** [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Zeus]] - (Tony Stark)\n** [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Hera]] - (Pepper Potts)\n** [[Kate Kildare (Earth-616)|Kate Kildare]]\n\n* Members \n** [[Henry Hellrung (Earth-616)|Anthem]] - (Henry Hellrung)\n** [[Rebecca Ryan (Earth-616)|Aralune]]- (Rebecca Ryan)\n** [[James Wa (Earth-616)|Calamity]]- (James Wa)\n** [[Milo Fields (Earth-616)|Supernaut]] - (Milo Fields)\n** [[Pam Pierce (Earth-616)|Pierce]]- (Pam Pierce)\n** [[Avery Allen (Earth-616)|Avona]]- (Avery Allen)\n** [[Carlos Carvalho (Earth-616)|Corona]]- (Carlos Carvalho)\n** [[Jamal Peoples (Earth-616)|Maul]]- (Jamal Peoples)\n** [[Mulholland Black (Earth-616)|Mulholland Black]]\n** [[Dennis Murray (Earth-616)|Heavy]]- (Dennis Murray)\n** [[Magdalena Marie (Earth-616)|Veda]]- (Magdalena Marie)\n** [[Aphrodite (CSA) (Earth-616)|Aphrodite]]- (Name Unrevealed)\n** [[Hercules (CSA) (Earth-616)|Hercules]]- (Name Unrevealed)\n\n* Robots: \n** [[Bannerman Green (Earth-616)|Bannerman Green]]\n** [[Bannerman Brown (Earth-616)|Bannerman Brown]]\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Quote from [[Matt Fraction]] regarding The Order:  \"The Order is a modern superhero book, in terms of how it's been created and how it's managed, and, behind the scenes, in terms of how [[Barry Kitson|Barry]] and I are telling their stories. But below the surface, everything about the team-- how it's run, who's on it, and what they can do -- follows a classical tradition by being modeled after the Greek pantheon of Gods... the first Order, if you will, of heroes. Inside and out, The Order is organized around the same principals that held together those twelve legends. [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] sits on top, playing the role of [[wikipedia:Zeus|Zeus]]. His girl Friday and the on-site leader of The Order is [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Pepper Potts]], playing the symbolic role of [[wikipedia:Hera|Hera]]. And on and on, down through the ranks. All of our characters have a mythical, symbolic role they fulfill, along with their quite-literal new superhuman identities.\n\n* \"The Greek gods were really kind of the original superhero team-- and if (artist) [[Barry Kitson]] and I were going to be launching a superhero team of our own, it seemed like following the order of the oldest and the best wasn't such a bad idea!\"\n| Trivia                  = * The Order were originally to be called [[The Champions]], possibly after the [[Champions of Los Angeles (Earth-616)|Champions of Los Angeles]].{{r|The Order Vol 2 1}}\n* Regarding [[Matt Fraction]]'s [[Order (Initiative) (Earth-616)#Notes|quote]], the second name, the Order, wasn't after the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]]'s alternate name.\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:50-State Initiative]]\n[[Category:2007 Team Debuts]]"
