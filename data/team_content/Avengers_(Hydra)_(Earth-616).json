The team consisted of [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]], [[Eric O'Grady (LMD) (Earth-616)|Black Ant]], [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], the [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Superior Octopus]], the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] (who had been possessed by [[Chthon (Earth-616)|Chthon]]), the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] (who was being controlled by an A.I. virus created by [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]]), and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Odinson]] (who had been promised the chance to save [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Jane Foster]] from the alternate dimension she was banished to and help in the restoration of [[Earth|Midgard]]'s connection to [[Asgard (Realm)|Asgard]] in exchange for his aid). One of their first known tasks was slaying the monster [[Krigorrath (Earth-616)|Krigorrath]] in [[Denver]], [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0|1}}{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 3}}{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 5}}\n\nThe Avengers aided Hydra in recovering the remnants of the sentient [[Cosmic Cube]] [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]]. They took part in an attack on a temple in [[Atlantis]] (the remnant there turned out to be a fake){{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 3}} and were led by Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers on a mission to recover a fragment in the [[Ultronic Territories]] that they eventually lost to the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 4}}\n\nThe Avengers were also tasked with preventing the mutant [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]] from being broken out of jail by his fellow mutants of [[New Tian]]{{r|Secret Empire: United Vol 1 1}} and apprehending a [[Warriors (Earth-616)|team of Inhumans]] led by ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Quake]].{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 3}} Scarlet Witch, Vision, and Odinson were later ordered to attack the Underground's hideout, [[Mount|The Mount]], though they were unable to break through its defenses, and Odinson chose to let the Underground escape.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 6}}\n\nAs well as defending the United States, the Avengers were tasked with defending Hydra assets in foreign territories including a worldwide network of automated signal-boost outposts that maintained the [[Planetary Defense Shield]].{{r|Avengers Vol 7 10}}\n\nThe Avengers started to fall apart when the Underground and its allies mobilized to overthrow Hydra's control of the country. Odinson, Superior Octopus, Scarlet Witch, and Vision were sent to stop the heroes, but Odinson decided to switch sides after growing tired of Hydra's atrocities, Scarlet Witch was freed from Chthon's possession by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], and Vision freed himself of Zola's A.I. virus with help from his daughter [[Vivian (Synthezoid) (Earth-616)|Viv]]. Taskmaster and Black Ant chose to quit working for Hydra after the pair realized that Hydra was going to lose and even freed [[Red Room (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|young heroes]] being held in Hydra's custody.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}} Deadpool chose to quit Hydra after realizing Hydra was evil.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 35}}\n\n| Equipment               = Each members' respective equipment.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each members' respective weapons.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Hydra Projects]]"
