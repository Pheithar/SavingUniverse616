Together, [[Thales (Earth-616)|Thales the Milesian]], [[Pythagoras (Earth-616)|Pythagoras of Samos]], and  [[Pherecydes (Earth-616)|Pherecydes of Syros]], formed '''The Triumvirate'''. Influenced by the ideals of democratic political philosophy, the Triumvirate argued that three joint Sorcerers Supreme more closely matched the [[Vishanti (Earth-616)|Trinity of the Vishanti]]. Eventually, Pythagoras was replaced by [[Empedocles (Earth-616)|Empedocles of Agrigentum]], and later Thales was replaced by [[Epimenides (Earth-616)|Epimenides of Knossos]]. The Triumvirate tenure as Sorcerer Supreme had mixed results and ended around 400 B.C. when all three sorcerers were defeated by [[Caius (Earth-616)|Caius of Lacedaemons]], who succeeded them as the Sorcerer Supreme.{{r|Marvel Tarot #1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 7}}<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix7/agamotto-vishanti.html#Sorcerer Marvel Universe App: Succession of the Sorcerer Supreme]</ref>\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The three Sorcerers Supreme jointly serving as the Triumvirate is seen in the legends of the Three Magi or Three Wise Men.<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix7/agamotto-vishanti.html#Sorcerer Marvel Universe App: Succession of the Sorcerer Supreme]</ref>\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]"
