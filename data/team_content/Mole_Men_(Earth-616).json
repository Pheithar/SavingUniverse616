They were so called due to their large hands and quick digging skills, which were the result of a chemical formula created by the Mole Men's leader, the [[Yellow Claw (Japanese) (Earth-616)|Yellow Claw]].\n\nIn the spring of 1945, the Mole Men were sent to the United States, to use their digging abilities to sabotage American war factories. After completing their first attack, they stumbled upon a gold prospector and his daughter and captured the girl while the old man fled. The old man returned with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky]], who clashed with the Mole Men while freeing the girl and fled. Yellow Claw then sent the Mole Men to capture [[General Haywood (Earth-616)|General Haywood]] in order to learn military secrets, but the commanding officer refused to talk. When Captain America and Bucky returned to rescue Haywood, they were overpowered by the Mole Men, who pushed the three Americans into an underground river.\n\nThey survived this, and attacked again, just as Yellow Claw was attempting to activate a dormant volcano with TNT. During the fight, Yellow Claw and the Mole Men charged after Cap and Bucky. When the two heroes dodged out of the way, the entire army fell into a chasm to their deaths.{{r|All Select Comics Vol 1 6}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The Mole Men have no known connection to the Mole Men ruled by [[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Harvey Elder, the Mole Man]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
