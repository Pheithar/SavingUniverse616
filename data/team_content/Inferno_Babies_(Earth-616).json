They were rescued by the [[X-Terminators (Earth-616)|X-Terminators]] and [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] and given to the [[United States of America|US]] government. Now all grown up, warped by [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]], and trained for combat by [[Project Purgatory (Earth-616)|Project Purgatory]], [[General Ulysses (Earth-616)|General Ulysses]], and [[Doctor Noc (Earth-616)|Doctor Noc]].\n| PlaceOfFormation        = [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]]\n| PlaceOfDissolution      = \n| Creators                = Louise Simonson; Jon Bogdanove; Zeb Wells; Leonard Kirk\n| First                   = X-Terminators #3\n| First2                  = (babies, first full appearance)<br>{{sld|New Mutants Vol 3 #16}}(adults, unnamed)\n| Last                    = \n\n| HistoryText             = \n===Inferno===\nUsing information from [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]], thirteen [[Homo Superior|mutant]] babies were kidnapped, by [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]]'s N'asteris, during the [[Inferno (Event)|Inferno]]. The infants arrived in a cemetery, where the demon N'astirh was attempting to create a permanent portal open between the demon infested dimension of [[Limbo (Demonic)|Limbo]] and [[Earth-616|Earth]]. The infants were teleported to [[Times Square]], where the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutant]], [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]], was opening a portal to return her teammates from Limbo and N'astirh, using the babies as the points of an inverted pentagram (focusing beams of power because of their purity and openness to use them as natural, living conduits who could not block the flow of power and who would not know how to shut it off), kept the portal open. N'astirh attempted to used them, and baby [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Christopher Summers]], who later grew-up to become Cable, to open a portal from Limbo to Earth and was partially successful in merging the two realms. The [[X-Terminators (Earth-616)|X-Terminators]] and the New Mutants saved the children.\n\nAfter the defeat of N'astirh, the [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Goblin Queen]] attempted to sacrifice baby Christopher and three other mutant babies atop the [[Empire State Building]] to finish N'astirh's work and permanently open a gateway between Earth and Limbo. The invasion was thwarted after the Goblin Queen committed suicide in combat with [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]], attempting to kill everyone in her power. After the X-Terminators and New Mutants took the babies to X-Factor's [[Celestials|Celestial]] [[Prosh (Earth-616)|Ship]], X-Factor turned the babies over to the [[United States of America|US]] government, after being attacked by [[Eleanor Murch (Earth-616)|Nanny]] and [[Orphan-Maker (Peter) (Earth-616)|Orphan-Maker]].\n\n===Project Purgatory===\nFor many years the fate of children remained unknown. Following the Inferno, the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|United States Army]] founded [[Project Purgatory (Earth-616)|Project Purgatory]] to research the fields of the supernatural and paranormal. One of the recruited scientists, [[Doctor Noc (Earth-616)|Doctor Noc]], developed technology to use the children to open portals to Limbo. [[General Ulysses (Earth-616)|General Ulysses]], Doctor Noc, and a trained band of military soldiers established a military base in Limbo, the Hatchery.  At the base, they continued to experiment, both on [[Demons|demons]] and on the Inferno babies, and train new soldiers.  However, when the soldiers recovered the [[Bloodstones|Bloodstone amulet]], the base was attacked by [[Ananym (Earth-616)|Witchfire]] and the Inferno babies were believed dead. The [[Earth]] based military forces sealed off the portal Epsilon, leaving those on the Limbo base stranded to find the observation portal with virtually no hope of escape.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 16}}\n\nAfter 26 years in Limbo, but only 4 years on Earth, Noc and Ulysses were able to locate a traveling portal and return home, keeping the existence of the children to themselves. However, they never gave up their mission of taking control of Limbo and capturing [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Illyana Rasputin]]. They returned to a world where all of the mutants were living together, on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]]. and, therefore, their commanding officer, [[General Combest (Earth-616)|General Combest]], ordered them to stand-down. The unit still believed that Illyana was a significant threat and, after Project Purgatory kidnapped [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]], the Inferno Babies revealed themselves when they killed General Combest and obliterated the entire battalion. The New Mutants showed to rescue Pixie and the Inferno Babies defeated them. After Dr. Noc and General Ulysses took Illyana's [[Soulsword]] and Pixie's [[Souldagger]], they extracted the Bloodstones and completed the Bloodstone Amulet to call forth the [[Elder Gods of Limbo|Elder Gods]]. They, along with members of Project Purgatory, tortured the New Mutants; [[Trista (Earth-616)|Trista]] controlled [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]], [[Bob (Inferno Baby) (Earth-616)|Bob]] used a smaller portion of himself to probe into [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]]'s nose, [[Face (Inferno Baby) (Earth-616)|Face]] had blasted [[Amara Aquilla (Earth-616)|Magma]] unconscious, and [[Loca (Inferno Baby) (Earth-616)|Loca]] broke [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Mirage]]'s arm and strapped [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]] to explosives, while he watched [[Timothy (Inferno Baby) (Earth-616)|Timothy]] and members of Project Purgatory beat Mirage more.\n\nWhile attempting to transport the New Mutants to Limbo, to be used as sacrifices for the Elder Gods, [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]] showed Face what Project Purgatory had done to him and he killed Timothy, [[Maw (Inferno Baby) (Earth-616)|Maw]], and members of Project Purgatory and freed Magik and Karma. Once they returned to Limbo, the Demons Three asked them to turn over the Bloodstone Amulet and General Ulysses had them beg for mercy, then killed. After releasing the Elder Gods, General Ulysses was killed attempting to control them and the group fought against a demon horde. While fighting, Loca was killed by Mirage, Trista ordered Cypher to learn a machine that Trista and the others didn't understand and he used it to magically erase her mouth, ending her influence over him, and Dr. Noc ordered a retreat. While fleeing with Dr. Noc, [[Scab (Inferno Baby) (Earth-616)|Scab]] was destroyed in the escape vehicles by Cannonball, seeking revenge for himself and his teammates.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n* In {{cl|X-Terminators #2}} [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]] says that he needs '''''thirteen children''''', who will act as focuses for his power and open gate from Limbo to Earth.:\n** Ten of them are the Inferno Babies who were used in vertex of the pentagram-gate;\n** In {{cl|X-Terminators #3}} [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]] goes on to say, \"I require one more infant to channel power for the entrance spell.
