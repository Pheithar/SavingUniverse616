When he refused, hired assassin [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Ulysses Klaw]] killed T'Chaka. This account of events retconned the previously established version of T'Chaka's death. Years later, this interpretation was overwritten by {{cl|Rise of the Black Panther Vol 1 1}}, which returned to the original version of T'Chaka's death in which Klaw invaded Wakanda and killed T'Chaka when he refused to share Vibranium with him.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Wikipedia               = \n| Links                   = * {{WP|Bilderberg Group|Bilderberg Group at Wikipedia.org}}\n}}\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:International Organizations]]"
