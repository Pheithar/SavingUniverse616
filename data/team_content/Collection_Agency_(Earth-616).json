For a while, they worked for the [[Taneleer Tivan (Earth-616)|Collector]] until [[Jude (Collection Agency) (Earth-616)|Jude]]'s apparent death, though Jude's head survived and was seen in a preservation tank.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 61|64}}\n\n| Equipment               = Cybernetics\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Advanced weaponry including energy siphons and protective fields\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/collecag.htm\n}}"
