Although Batroc can and has operated on many occasions as a solo mercenary, he frequently employs a \"Brigade\" contingent upon his assignment. Most commonly, the Brigade is formed by only two additional costumed mercenaries, always with Batroc as the leader.\n\n===First Batroc's Brigade:===\nThe first Brigade was formed when Batroc was hired by an unknown person to steal an object called the \"seismo-bomb\". Batroc, considering the task beyond his personal skills, hired two more mercenaries, but they were defeated by Captain America and the mission was a failure.\n\n*[[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc the Leaper]] - (Georges Batroc)\n*[[Arthur Parks (Earth-616)|Living Laser]] - (Arthur Parks)\n*[[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]] - (Jacques Duquesne)\n\n===Second Batroc's Brigade===\nBatroc formed a new Brigade when he was hired by [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Android) (Earth-616)|The Hood]]. The Hood wanted Batroc and other mercenaries to attack Captain America, but they were again defeated. The Second Brigade included:\n\n*[[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc the Leaper]] - (Georges Batroc)\n*[[Alexander Gentry (Earth-616)|Porcupine]] - (Alexander Gentry)\n*[[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Whirlwind]] - (David Cannon)\n\n===Third Brigade===\n\n[[File:Batroc's Brigade, Daniel Rand, Georges Batroc (Earth-616) from Marvel Premiere Vol 1 20.jpg|thumb|Third Brigade]]For a time, Batroc composed \"brigades\" with various common thugs. None of them had superhuman powers, advanced technology or a costume{{r|Marvel Premiere #20}}.\n\n===Fourth Brigade===\n\nBatroc formed a last brigade with other two mercenaries to try and steal [[Captain America's Shield|Captain America's shield]], but that mission also failed.
