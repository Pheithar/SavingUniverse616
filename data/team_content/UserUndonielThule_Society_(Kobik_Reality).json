Elisa Sinclair's connection within the '''Thule Society''' were crucial for this plan. Hydra wished to benefit of the relics of the dark arts and the Lost Gods that Hitler was assembling.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #8}}\n\n=====1945=====\nIn 1945, the Red Skull eventually successfully took over Elisa Sinclair's [[Brotherhood of the Spear (Earth-TRN640)|Spear]], merging it with the Thule Society{{verify source}}<!-- that was valid at the time it was in Earth-616, where Red Skull was Thule --> into the modern Hydra, creating a definitive organization.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers #15|16}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
