The Megans had come to invade [[Earth]] while searching for material to supply them in the war; however, the Betans were able to successfully capture [[Godzilla (Earth-616)|Godzilla]] and to test his power to see how he would fair against the disastrous trio, the three members of the Mega-Monsters.\n\n[[Beta-Beast (Earth-616)|Beta-Beast]] then engaged Godzilla in a battle on the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]] to judge his worthiness to fight in a battle against the Mega-Monsters, but was killed by his radioactive fire breath as he left back to Earth through a portal from the Betans. It was there that Godzilla, with the help of [[SJ3RX (Earth-616)|Red Ronin]], engaged in combat against [[Triax (Monster) (Earth-616)|Triax]].{{r|Godzilla Vol 1 12}}\n\nDespite them getting the upper hand in the beginning of the battle, [[Rhiahn (Earth-616)|Rhiahn]], the team leader, successfully decapitated the Red Ronin just before getting blasted with the Energex-Ray by the Megans, which increased their height, power, and intelligence by a factor of ten-fold.{{r|Godzilla Vol 1 13}} As they were just about to kill Godzilla, [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] stepped in to distract the monsters, thus allowing Godzilla to regained his strength and kill them one by one, bringing their threat to an end.{{r|Godzilla Vol 1 14}}\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
