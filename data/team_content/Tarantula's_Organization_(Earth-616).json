Which was involved in drug smuggling, theft, extortion, and murder.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 432}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 436}}{{r|Daredevil Annual Vol 2 1}} It was a crime family which had ruled [[Argentina]] for a thousand years.{{r|Daredevil Blood of the Tarantula Vol 1 1}} Members either had a spider tattoo or wore a spider symbol on their clothing.{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited Vol 1 22}}{{r|Daredevil Blood of the Tarantula Vol 1 1}} The organization had fanatical operatives, who were willing to die for their \"deathless\" master. Ritual suicide for failing was an option for these operatives.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 421}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 423}} When it expanded to the [[United States of America|United States]], a deal was made with the dominant crimelord of [[New York City]] at the time [[Vincente Fortunato (Earth-616)|Don Fortunato]]. In which they were allowed to setup operations in the city, getting the hijacking racket in exchange.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 434}} \n\nThe organization worked with [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon Energy]] and the [[United States Government (Earth-616)|U.S. Department of Defense]], on a project to produce super-powered soldiers. It was in the nation of [[Bolivia]], on land owned by Tarantula's organization and in a complex that used to be owned by the [[Brand Corporation (Earth-616)|Brand Corporation]]. Roxxon funding was to the Black Tarantula's operations as were the super-powered soldiers that would have been produced by the facility. [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] followed them to the Bolivian facility, where he battled the Scorpion, and during the fighting federal agents arrived. They arrested those at the facility, though the Black Tarantula got away.{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited Vol 1 22}}\n\nYears later, the organization sent Black Tarantula's cousin along with several men to New York City. They were to kill him for betraying the organization (as he had become a vigilante). His cousin was going to bleed him dry, and use his blood in the ritual to become the new Black Tarantula. Afterwards they were going to re-establish their presence in New York City, and flood the streets with heroin. With the help of the [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], they were defeated but two innocents were killed by his cousin who in turn was killed by the Black Tarantula. He advised Daredevil, that his family would never stop, and sooner or later they would send more men to kill him and take over New York City.{{r|Daredevil Blood of the Tarantula Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Cartels]]"
