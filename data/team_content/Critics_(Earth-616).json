The Critics tribunal consisted of [[Agent of Heaven (Earth-616)|The Agent of Heaven]], [[Agent of Hell (Earth-616)|Agent of Hell]] and the [[Agent of the Realm Between (Earth-616)|Agent of the Realm Between]]. They each had to decide where a soul would travel.\n\nThe Critics were first seen when [[Darrel Daniel (Earth-616)|Darrel Daniel]] changed [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]] and his friends into actors in a play about his life. The play ended with the reenactment of Darrel Suicide which annoyed the Critics.\n\nThe three then began their judgment on his soul. His life was neither morally or artistically worthwhile and none of the Critics wished him to enter Heaven, [[Hell]], or the Realm Between. They decided that their only choice was to destroy his soul sending it into the oblivion of nothingness.\n\n[[Richard Rory (Earth-616)|Richard Rory]] tried to defend Darrel Daniel after witnessing his life, but the Critics warned him if he interfered his soul would also be destroyed. Man-Thing tried to attack the Critics, which was pointless. [[Ayla Prentiss (Earth-616)|Ayla Prentiss]], in a moment of supreme sacrifice, offered her soul instead. This great gesture humbled the Critics and they decided to let him enter the Kingdom of Heaven{{r|Man-Thing #5|6}}.\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Sword, Axe, Trident \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
