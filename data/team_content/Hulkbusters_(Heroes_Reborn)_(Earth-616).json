Their ranks included [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] who became the gamma spawned Hulk after the terrorist organization [[Hydra (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Hydra]] exploded his own gamma bomb with himself trapped inside; [[Leonard Samson (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Leonard Samson]] who was forcibly injected with gamma radiation by government agent [[Jasper Sitwell (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Jasper Sitwell]] into an abomination, however a blood transfusion from the Hulk stabilized his mutation; Lastly, [[Jennifer Walters (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Jennifer Walters]] who impulsively gave herself a blood transfusion and become the She-Hulk.{{Citation}}\n\nShortly after their formation, they helped the [[Avengers (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Avengers]] battle the heralds of [[Galactus (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Galactus]] following the death of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]. She-Hulk joined [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] in battling [[Tyros (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Terrax]] in Attilan, killing the Herald. Doc Samson joined [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]], [[Steve Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] in battling [[Pyreus Kril (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Firelord]] on Monster Island. Lastly, Bruce Banner aided [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Dr. Doom]], [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], and [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] in attempting to build a device to stop Galactus. This failed and, they all perished. However, Dr. Doom traveled back in time to change history and prevent Galactus from succeeding in his mission. This time around, the Hulkbusters saved the Fantastic Four from death, and Banner worked with the reunited [[Knights of the Atomic Roundtable (Earth-616)|Knights of the Atomic Roundtable]] in building an Ultimate Nullifier to ultimately stop Galactus.{{r|Iron Man Vol 2 12}}{{r|Captain America Vol 2 12}}\n\nThe Hulkbusters broke up shortly thereafter, with the Hulk resuming his usual rampaging nature. He and She-Hulk were among the mass exodus of heroes from Counter-Earth to [[Earth-616]] to save both Earths from destruction at the hands of the [[Celestials]], and they were merged with their Earth-616 counterparts.{{Citation}} The fate of Doc Samson remains unrevealed.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
