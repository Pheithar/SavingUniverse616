The team originally included [[Vox (Action Pack) (Earth-616)|Vox]] (the team's leader, who seems to have at least some degree of technological aptitude), [[Prima Donna (Earth-616)|Prima Donna]] (a superhuman supermodel, whose abilities include enhanced strength), and a [[Eugene Patillo (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Skrull impostor]] who posed as [[Eugene Patilio (Earth-616)|Frog-Man]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #7}}\n\nAfter they had just finished the construction of their base [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]] and [[Cloud Nine (Abigail) (Earth-616)|Cloud 9]] tore through the wall attempting to verify whether [[Michael van Patrick (Earth-616)|Michael Van Patrick]] was dead or alive. Subsequently, the Action Pack's only known altercation came following Justice's arrival, in which he used his telekinetic abilities to temporarily disable the team, so as to avoid questions about his and Cloud 9's search for Michael Van Patrick.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #7}}\n\n==Action Pack== \n*[[Vox (Action Pack) (Earth-616)|Vox]] - (Name unrevealed)\n*[[Prima Donna (Earth-616)|Prima Donna]] - (Name unrevealed)\n*[[Eugene Patilio (Earth-616)|Frog-Man]] - (Eugene Patilio)\n*[[Eugene Patilio (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Frog-Man (Skrull)]] - (Eugene Patilio)\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = *[[Dan Slott]] created Action Pack when fans asked him to bring back Frog-Man.\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:50-State Initiative]]"
