This was considered by the locals a small price to pay for peace with that dark and sinister god. Their minaret's dome was open, to allow the Night-God to enter his temple.{{r|Conan the Barbarian #6|; Devil-Wings Over Shadizar}}\n\nOne of the women offered as sacrifice was impregnated by the Bat-God, and gave birth to the bat-winged humanoid hybrid [[Night-Goddess (Earth-616)|Night-Goddess]].<!-- {{r|Conan the Barbarian #274|; Demon-Wings Over Zamora}} --><!-- \n\nWhile her father was away on a pilgrimage,{{r|Conan the Barbarian #274|; Demon-Wings Over Zamora}} the Night-God's priestess [[Hajii (Earth-616)|Hajii]] [...Conan adventure...].{{r|Conan the Barbarian #6|; Devil-Wings Over Shadizar}} -->\n\nWhile the priestess' father was away on a pilgrimage,{{r|Conan the Barbarian #274|; Demon-Wings Over Zamora}} the Night-God was killed by [[Conan (Earth-616)|Conan]] and the priestess [[Hajii (Earth-616)|Hajii]] was slain by [[Jenna (Earth-616)|Jenna]].{{r|Conan the Barbarian #6|; Devil-Wings Over Shadizar}}\n\n===Crow Cult of Ma'kannta, God of the Talon===\n<!-- how many years between the three stories: need to determine correct placement of Haiji's events mentioned in CtB 274 -->The cult went on despite their god's death, but became the '''Crow Cult'''. Some cultists wore the same red robes but were now assisted in battle by [[crows]], while other members wore crow costumes and could emit deafening shrieks.<!-- {{r|Avengers No Road Home #6}}redundant but the change isn't really clear --> They kept on sacrificing young maidens to their god, now [[Ma'kannta (Earth-616)|Ma'kannta, God of the Talon]]. They presented themselves as the '''Bastard Children of the [[Bird-Men of Akah Ma'at|Akah Ma'at]]''', forced into hiding, and wishing to free Ma'kannta from his demonic realm prison, for him to protect them, and thus enabling them to reclaim the skies over Shadizar.{{r|Avengers No Road Home #6}} The exact nature of their relation to the Akah Ma'at, if it really exists, remains unrevealed.<!-- it is unclear if the Akah Ma'at bit is a pose/title/guise adopted by the cult, or a real thing:\n* They do have powers (crows, shrieks... or the crows are domesticated and the shrieks aren't powers?), but they didn't had them as the Night-Cult, could be originated from their worship of Ma'kannta\n* they do seem to have changed their theme almost completely\n\ncompared to the statement of the priest in CtB274 (which was likely ignored by Avengers No Road Home) to the change in a crow cult, it can be explained as some kind of schism, the whole cell disolving into a new Crow Cult, later wiped out or weakened, while the Night-Cult returned -->\n\nAs Conan and the time-displaced [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] tracked bandits who had stolen a [[Night Shard]], a piece of the [[Olympians|Olympian]] goddess [[Nyx (Earth-616)|Nyx]]'s soul, those bandits were attacked by night-cultists and crows, who looted the Shard away.<!-- {{r|Avengers No Road Home #6}} -->\n\nThey used the Night Shard, the \"Ebon Key\", for its [[eldritch power]] to free Ma'kannta, through a girl's sacrifice. Though Conan prevented the girl's death, the Shard still cut her, and the blood spilled was enough to return Ma'kannta from its demonic realm prison. Conan battled the crow cultists and the god, possibly slaying all of cultists, until the Shard was detected by Nyx. She intervened, along with her [[Children of the Night (Earth-616)|Children of the Night]] seemingly killing Ma'kannta or return him to his realm.{{r|Avengers No Road Home #6}} The heroes, rejoined by other [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] then battled Nyx and her ilk among the corpses of the Crow cultists.{{r|Avengers No Road Home #7}}\n\n===Night-Cult and the Night-Goddess===\nWhen the priestess' father returned from pilgrimage, he found the temple destroyed, the order dissolved, and learned of his daughter's and his god's deaths. According to their people's beliefs, no new incarnation of their god would come to them nor answer their prayers until the deaths caused by Conan were avenged.<!-- {{r|Conan the Barbarian #274|; Demon-Wings Over Zamora}} --><!-- verify order if before or after No Road Home. this part is the connection to the two stories, to be correct if move in the order -->\n\nThe '''Night-Cult''' returned, led by the priestess' father, and rebuilt the tower, though only of wood, feeling they weren't worthy till their honor was revenged. During the next two years, the cult sacrificed a female upon the altar, and sometimes heard the flapping of wings, though no god ever came, as the Night-Goddess did not care for women. They purchased the [[Grey Lotus|Lotus]] many of their worshipers required for their visions from [[Character Index/Y#Yatha|Yatha]].<!-- {{r|Conan the Barbarian #274|; Demon-Wings Over Zamora}} -->\n\nTwo years later, their sacred assassins followed Conan after he slew Yatha and burned his warehouse. As Conan's [[Kozaki (Earth-616)|Free Companions]] fled [[Koth (Hyboria)|Koth]] and camped in Zamora, near Shadizar, a Night-Cult recognized Conan at [[Maldiz (Earth-616)|Maldiz]]'s tavern. The Night-Cult attacked their camp a couple days later, capturing the \"God-Slayer\".<!-- {{r|Conan the Barbarian #274|; Demon-Wings Over Zamora}} -->\n\nHe was placed on the altar, and it \"the Night-God\", in fact the Night-Goddess, appeared to take the male sacrifice. She wished to take her as mate, but Conan believed she would fed him to her spawn afterwards, and decided to attack them. Conan slew the Night-Goddess, only to realize she was only taking him away from her hatchings, as any mother would.{{r|Conan the Barbarian #274|; Demon-Wings Over Zamora}}\n\nThe whereabouts of the Night-Cult afterwards remains unknown.<!-- verify order with Avengers: No Road Home #6, they possibly became the Crow Cult AFTER the episode of the Night-Goddess -->\n\n==Powers==\nThe so-called Bastard Children of the [[Bird-Men of Akah Ma'at|Akah Ma'at]] could emit a deafening shriek.<!-- {{r|Avengers No Road Home #6}} -->\n\nWounded night-cultists could magically wither into dust and death,<!-- {{r|Avengers No Road Home #6}} though the exact of means of it remains unknown.
