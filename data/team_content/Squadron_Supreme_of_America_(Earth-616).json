[[Phillip Coulson (Earth-616)|Phil Coulson]] acted as their liaison.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 18}}\n\nThe Squadron Supreme of America first appeared when Phil Coulson promoted them to [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Thunderbolt Ross]] as the United States of America's sanctioned superhero team.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 10}} The Squadron then confronted different radical groups like [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|King Namor]]'s [[Defenders of the Deep (Earth-616)|Defenders of the Deep]].{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2019 Avengers}}\n\nWhen [[Malekith (Earth-616)|Malekith the Accursed]] attacked Earth during the [[War of the Realms]], the Squadron Supreme of America were summoned when [[Frost Giants]] from the realm of [[Jotunheim]] invaded [[Washington, D.C.]]. The Squadron routed the invaders out of the American frontier in [[Lake Erie]], and were subsequently sent to [[Ohio (State)|Ohio]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 18}}\n\nThe Squadron Supreme of America were summoned to confront [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] when he infiltrated [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-616)|Phil Coulson]]'s office at the [[Pentagon]]. Before they could apprehend him, Black Panther had [[Broo (Earth-616)|Broo]] teleport him away. As he disappeared, Black Panther stated to the Squadron Supreme that the Avengers weren't their enemies, but would become such if their hand was forced.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 21}}\n\nCoulson later sold his soul to Mephisto to gain the power of the [[Pandemonium Cube]], a demonic artifact with the power to warp reality itself.{{r|Heroes Return Vol 1 1}} Coulson used the Cube to change Earth-616 to [[Earth-TRN852]], a reality where the Avengers never existed and the [[Squadron Supreme of America (Earth-TRN852)|Squadron Supreme]] were the world's premiere superhero team.{{r|Heroes Reborn Vol 2 1}} Reality was eventually returned to normal by [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade the Vampire Hunter]] and his team of [[Avengers (Earth-TRN852)|Avengers]]. For his failure, Mephisto trapped Coulson in the Pandemonium Cube. With Coulson's disappearance, the Squadron Supreme fell apart. Blur, Doctor Spectrum, and Power Princess were taken into government custody, Hyperion went to parts unknown, and Nighthawk went off on his own to remake reality back to Earth-TRN852.{{r|Heroes Return Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = Each member's respective equipment\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each member's respective weapons\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:DC Comics Pastiches]]"
