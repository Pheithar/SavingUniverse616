The [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] were called in to diffuse the situation which was made more difficult by confrontations with the [[People's Protectorate]] and the Atlanteans. The sub was damaged and surfaced off the coast of Newfoundland. The situation now being in Canadian territory, jurisdiction passed on to [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]]. While the combined heroes did almost stop the Peace Corpse, the leaders, Illyich Prokvitch and Strokov wired themselves into the nuclear payload. When the Vision and [[Vostok]] cut the connection, a failsafe was activated and a nuclear explosion ensued. {{r|Avengers Vol 1 319|323}}\n\n[[Michael Twoyoungmen (Earth-616)|Shaman]] was able to shunt the affected area into his [[Shaman's Medicine Pouch|pouch]]. Once there, Prokvitch and Strokov became a being known as the [[Combine (Earth-616)|Combine]] and threatened to destroy everyone. It was only when the other Peace Corpse members joined the Combine that they were able to sway that opinion and save the entire group of people by absorbing their irradiated energy. {{r|Avengers Vol 1 323|324}}\n| Equipment               = The Peace Corpse had access to a variety of military weapons.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
