Their headquarters is called [[Lookout Point]]. They are the only thing that stands between attacks from the west and the mainland. When [[Delroy Garrett Jr. (Earth-616)|3-D Man]] arrived in Hawaii and was greeted by Point Men team members [[Star Sign (Earth-616)|Star Sign]] and [[Paydirt (Earth-616)|Paydirt]]. He encountered [[Eric Payne (Earth-616)|Devil-Slayer]] on the way to the base, who stated that he has sensed portents of doom all day. When he met the final team member Magnitude, the goggles Delroy obtained from the original 3-D Man allowed him to identify Magnitude as a [[Skrull]] impostor. The Skrull Magnitude (who had the powers of [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], and [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]]) attacked and severely wounded Star Sign and Paydirt, but Delroy killed the Skrull with a sword magically summoned by Devil-Slayer. Devil Slayer used his Shadow Cloak to teleport Delroy to [[Camp Hammond]], where he announced to everyone assembled that the Initiative had been infiltrated by Skrulls.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 14}}\n\nFollowing the Skrull Invasion and 3-D Man leaving the team, the Point Men gain [[Walter Newell (Earth-616)|Stingray]] as their new leader where he will also continue his research.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 20}}\n\nStar Sign and Paydirt represented the Point Men where they were amongst the representatives of the other 50-State Initiative teams that met [[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Prodigy]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to talk about the hammers that the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]] sent down to Earth.{{r|Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt Vol 1 1}}\n\n==Members==\n* [[Walter Newell (Earth-616)|Stingray]] - His [[Stingray's Suit|suit]] grants him super-human strength and durability to handle underwater conditions, enable him to swim at high speeds, and has a potent electrical blast.\n* [[Delroy Garrett Jr. (Earth-616)|3-D Man]] - His goggles can detect Skrulls.\n* [[Paydirt (Earth-616)|Paydirt]] - Can manipulate the molecules of dirt.\n* [[Magnitude (Earth-616)|Magnitude]] - Was revealed to be a Skrull infiltrator who had the powers of Banshee, Havok, Polaris, and Sunfire.\n* [[Star Sign (Earth-616)|Star Sign]] - No information available about her powers.\n* [[Eric Payne (Earth-616)|Devil-Slayer]] - Telepathic, telekinetic, and a sixth sense.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each teammates' arsenal\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:50-State Initiative]]"
