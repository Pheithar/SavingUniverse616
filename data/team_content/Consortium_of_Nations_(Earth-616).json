As [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] became at political odds with the nations of Earth, they arranged nuclear assaults against him. The first came as retaliation to his manifesting the floating city-continent of [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]] above [[New York City]]. Thor thwarted this strike.{{r|Thor Vol 2 51}}\n\nThe Consortium also later arranged for a priest to be used as bait to destroy Thor, detonating another nuclear device on an old abandoned island.{{r|Thor Vol 2 66}} Enraged, Thor found their secret base and destroyed the entire mountain with them still inside it. However, given their nature, it is entirely possible that the Consortium of Nations still exists.{{r|Thor Vol 2 67}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:International Organizations]]"
