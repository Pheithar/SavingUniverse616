Headed up by [[Wilma Calvin (Earth-616)|Dr. Wilma Calvin]] her team for this consisted of [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Dr. Ted Sallis]], chemist [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Bobbi Morse]], Dr. [[Paul Allen (Earth-616)|Paul Allen]], a medical doctor named Wendell, and a technician named Jim.\n\nBetween Sallis's girlfriend, [[Ellen Brandt (Earth-616)|Ellen Brandt]], and Allen, who was really an agent of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], the project was sabotaged, transforming Sallis into the Man-Thing. The locals considered Calvin a \"witch-woman\" for creating monsters in her laboratory. Calvin thought it was obvious that Man-Thing was what remained of Ted Sallis, but a local shot her in the back.{{r|Astonishing Tales #12}}\n\nDr. Wendell cared for her until Dr. Allen killed him and kidnapped her because of her knowledge of the serum.  Allen met his death at Man-Thing's hands.{{r|Astonishing Tales #13}} She was brought back to her home in [[New York City]] by [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]] and Dr. Morse. However, she was left unguarded and taken away by her son \"Vinnie\" ([[Percy Calvin (Earth-616)|Percy]]), who was forced to work for the Pusher.{{r|Astonishing Tales #15}} Eventually, Percy intervened and helped Ka-Zar defeat the Pusher, winding up in a full body cast. Although there was concern that Wilma would go into shock, she accepted things as they were and recovered.\n\nAt the behest of [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]], she created a new batch of the Super Soldier Serum, but it was taken and used by [[Victor Conrad (Earth-616)|Victorius]].{{r|Astonishing Tales #18}} After this, she denied all of Nick Fury's further orders for more serum.\n\nWilma was ultimately killed by Percy, who used his mother's death in order to attract the attention of Bobbi Morse, who had recently been injected with a combination of the Super Soldier Serum and the [[Infinity Formula]], in order to capture her and use her for his research.{{r|Mockingbird: S.H.I.E.L.D. 50th Anniversary Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  =\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D.
