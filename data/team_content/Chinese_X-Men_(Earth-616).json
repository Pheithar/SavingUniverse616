They were killed either by this event or by the [[Annex Squads (Earth-89149)|Annex Squads]] of an [[Earth-89149|alternate reality]].\n\nLooking at Tian's structure, it was speculated that at least a few of those mutants were psionics and energy creators.\n\nTheir bodies were found a few month later by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], when they came to Tian, the last entry of the [[Triploid Mutant (Artificial Mutant) (Earth-616)|Triploid Mutant]]'s notebook (who was investigating the Annex Squads).\n\n| Equipment               = The members of this team all wore white shirts and red pants, as monks.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = The team was actually never referenced by an other name than \"The Chinese X-Men\".\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
