She founded the religious organisation who began to preach on street corners about Captain Marvel's return, at a time when most believe were still unaware of this fact, urging people to worship the returned superhero and strive to better themselves so as to be worthy of his return.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 6 1}}\n\nIn an attempt to distance themselves from their 'cult' image, they began a nationwide food drive, collecting canned food, as well as sending aid to [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[North Korea]] and [[Darfur]]. At some point the church was infiltrated by [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]], such as '[[McNally (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Brother McNally]]' who died at some point and was exposed as a Skrull to some members of the church,{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 6 3}} with other Skrulls still hidden in their ranks, using the Church to hunt for \"Captain Marvel\".{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 6 5}}\n\n'Captain Marvel' approached Julia Starr, who was calling herself 'Mother Starr', and praised the good work they were doing, though he was uncomfortable with the religious aspects. After this conversation he began working with them, and led them to [[Wikipedia:Al-Fashir|Al-Fashir]] in [[Sudan]] to provide aid there. A warehouse they were speaking on top of was bombed, killing Julia Starr.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 6 4}} At least one other Skrull member of the church was chosen to act as a suicide bomber and was about to explode itself but was whisked away alongside two other Skrulls by Captain Marvel who moved so quickly he seemed to merely be a beam of light.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 6 5}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Alien-Based Earth Religions]]"
