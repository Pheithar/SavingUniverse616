Among their plans, they searched for immortality{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #2}} for about 6,000 years.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #4}}\n\nEvery aspect of history, politics, science, magic and faith has been influenced by them and their many \"tentacles\",{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #1}} and the very art of alchemy was a by-product of their Infinitas agenda.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #4}}\n\n===Early History===\n====Mesopotamia====\nIn 2671 B.C., in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Gidim (Earth-616)|Lord Gidim]] and his \"holy order\" had [[Nashtoth (Earth-616)|Brother Nashtoth]] look for over a year for the bones of [[Gilgamesh (Earth-616)|Gilgamesh]], which the great king had wanted to preserve from them. They finally managed to retrieve it (after fourteen months and seventeen tombs), in the [[House of Dust]].{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #2}}\n\n====Ancient Greece====\nIn 323 B.C., after [[Alexander of Macedon (Earth-616)|Alexander the Great]]'s death, [[Mormo (Earth-616)|Lord Mormo]] of the '''Order of the Hydra''' went to the Temple of [[Athena Parthenos (Earth-616)|Athena]] on the [[Acropolis of Phaselis]], [[Lycia]], to retrieve the [[Lance of Pelias|Spear]] of [[Achilles (Earth-616)|Achilles]] and his blood crusted into its blade, the key to immortality.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #2}}\n\n====China Qin Dynasty====\nIn 209 B.C., [[Qin Shi Huangdi (Earth-616)|Qin Shi Huang]] sent his court sorcerer [[X\u00fa F\u00fa (Earth-616)|X\u00fa F\u00fa]] to the immortal [[Anqi Sheng (Earth-616)|Anqi Sheng]] for the [[Elixir of Life]]. Anqi Sheng sent him away, asking for a certain price, and so X\u00fa F\u00fa returned with the gith of the emperor, tree thousand children, pure and from the very best families. Anqi Sheng was pleased by the gift and gave X\u00fa F\u00fa a component of the Elixir, enraging X\u00fa F\u00fa, and killed the offering.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #3}}\n\n===Medieval period===\nIn 710 A.D., in the Town of [[Ribe]] in [[Jutland]], helped by [[Strybiorn (Earth-616)|Strybiorn]] and his men, Hydra sorcerer [[Draugr (Hydra) (Earth-616)|Draugr]] buried the bones of [[Eggther (Earth-616)|Eggther]] (a [[Giants of Jotunheim|giant]] who had stolen the [[Arrow of Hoder|arrow]] of [[Hoder Vilison (Earth-616)|Hoder]]), in order to retrieve the arrow, a weapon capable of killing a god.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #2}}\n\nHydra was known at some period<!-- between the 12th and 14th centuries --> as the Cathari.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #1}}\n\n===15th Century===\n<!-- 1420-1498 -->[[Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada (Earth-616)|Torquemada]] was one of the tentacles of Hydra, as were the [[:Category:Medicis Family|Medicis]].{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #1}}\n\n===16th Century===\nIn 1522 A.D., on the Banks of the [[Caloosahatchee River]] in [[Florida (State)|Florida]], [[Count Duende (Earth-616)|Count Duende]] attacked his cousin [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n y Figueroa (Earth-616)|Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n y Figueroa]], slaughtering his men and asking him for the [[Fountain of Youth]]. As de Le\u00f3n told mocked him, stating there was no such Fountain there, Duende stabbed him and set the place for people to thinks natives had caused the slaughter.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #3}}\n\nHydra managed to manipulate and use the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition (Earth-616)|Holy Office of the Inquisition]].{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #4}} In 1537 A.D., in [[Spain]], Hydra members of the Holy Office of the Inquisition tried [[Doctor Garibaldi (Earth-616)|Dr. Garibaldi]] for his researches on the eternal life. As Garibaldi refused to confess an heresy, the inquisitors revealed themselves as Hydra members and offered to recruit him.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #3}}\n\n===19th Century===\n<!-- 1800 -->[[Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte (Earth-616)|Napol\u00e9on]] was one of the tentacles of Hydra.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #1}}\n\n===20th Century===\nThe Order was known for some time as the '''Ariosophist''' (meddling esoteric content and Nazism), the '''Wotanists''' (racist worshipers of [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Wotan]]), the '''Black Order''', the '''Sons of Anubis''', the '''Seven Kings''', the '''Green''' and the '''Red Societies''', then the '''Thule Society'''.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #1}}\n\n====[[World War II]]====\nOn their side, despite despising Hitler and his plans, [[Nikolaus Geist (Earth-616)|Geist]], [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]] and the Thule supported the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazis]], using them to access and pillage vaults and libraries in nearly every nation, including [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[Egypt]], in order to collect the rarest and most obscure of forbidden knowledge (magic, alchemy, physics...). For Hydra, [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Hitler]], [[Hideki Tojo (Earth-616)|Tojo]] and [[Benito Mussolini (Earth-616)|Mussolini]] were nothing more than individual tentacles.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #1}}\n\n=====1942=====\nIn February 1942, [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] and Baron Strucker belonged to the Thule Society. The Skull spent months tracking ancient myths, looking for an ancient, powerful weapon to destroy his enemies. Using the dead language of a Gypsy tribe the Skull exterminated and sacrificing numerous [[Homo mermanus|Atlanteans]], the Thule priests performed a ritual to invoke the [[Hammer of Skadi]], which landed in [[Antarctica]]. The Skull went on an expedition to find his prize, but the hammer could not be lifted. He told Strucker that what they found was on a crate destined for Hitler, but had secretly instructed the Thule agents to stay and guard the hammer.{{r|Fear Itself: Book of the Skull #1}} They erected [[Fortress Null|a stronghold]] around the hammer, guarding it and studying it for decades, kept from aging by Nazi superscience. The Skull kept this finding a secret from everyone, documenting his expedition in a sorcery book the Thule made out of Atlantean flesh and hiding the book in a secret lair in the Egyptian desert.{{r|Fear Itself: Book of the Skull #1}}{{r|Fear Itself #1}}\n\nThe Thule Society later acquired the [[Kraken (Mask)|Kraken]], a weapon of [[Lemurians (Homo mermanus)|Lemurian]] origin and ungodly power that they pillaged from the Atlanteans. Their scientists created an abomination from Atlantean corpses, as only an Atlantean could wield the Kraken. They were planning to test their new creation on the Allied troops during a battle, but both the weapon and the wielder were destroyed by [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Prince Namor]] of [[Atlantis]]. The Kraken was latter repaired by the [[Covenant (Earth-616)|Covenant]], a secret society dedicated to protecting the world from the occult who had informed Namor of Thule's activities. They also captured the scientist who created the abomination and forced him to abandon Thule and join them. As Namor refused to join their ranks, they needed him to created more abominations so they may wield the power of the Kraken for their own purposes.{{r|Captain America and Namor #635.1}}\n\n=====1943=====\nWhen Hitler wanted Thule's leader Baron von Strucker dead after his several failures,{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 29}} he escaped in [[Japan]] with the help of the Red Skull.{{r|Fury #1}} Here, Strucker joined the Skull's organization, renamed it [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]],{{r|Marvel Atlas #1|; Japan's entry}} killing its [[Supreme Hydra (Japanese) (Earth-616)|leader]] and becoming the new [[Supreme Hydra]].{{r|Capt. Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders Vol 1 #4}}{{r|Fury #1}}{{r|Marvel Universe #1}}\n\nStrucker later regained Hitler's favour and he returned in [[Germany]],{{r|Sgt. Fury Vol 1 112|114}} operating as a loyal Nazi but secretly leading both Hydra{{r|Marvel Universe #1|3}} and Thule Society.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #1}}\n\n=====1944=====\nIn 1944, Thule scientist Nikolaus Geist started his ''Infinitas Agenda'', a program with the purpose of creating an [[Auferstehungs Corps (Earth-616)|army of superpowered soldiers]]. They were temporarily stopped by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], his sidekick [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky]] and [[German Freedom League (Earth-616)|German Freedom League]] agent [[Trude Lohn (Earth-616)|Trude Lohn]].{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #1}}\n\n=====1945=====\nIn January, 1945,{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #1}} a branch{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #3}} of the Thule summoned a [[Snow Wyrms|Snow Wyrm]] of [[Jotunheim]] in the [[Ardennes]], thinking they could control it. This ultimately caused the deaths of their units of German soldiers. They also summoned the [[Valkyrior (Earth-616)|Choosers of the Slain]], including [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Brunnhilde]], who found the corpses. Brunnhilde remained there, slew the Wyrm and set out to find the ones responsible.{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #1}}\n\nIn March, [[Raizo Kodo (Earth-616)|Raizo Kodo]] raided a Thule lab outside [[Berlin]], where they attempted to control [[vampires]] and turn them into weapons. He killed the scientists and agents, and briefly met with Brunnhilde, before detonating the lab.{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #2}}\n\nIn April, Brunnhilde attacked a Thule base as they were delivered the [[Golden Apples of Idunn]], and was opposed by Thule's creatures.{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #3}}<!-- complete -->\n\n===Legacy===\nAfter [[World War II]], The Thule agents spread over the world after, as the Thule Society was greatly diminished.{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #8}} Thule's agents, possibly as part of Hydra,{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #1|'s recap page}} infiltrated several espionage secret agencies, including [[Atlas Foundation (Earth-616)|Atlas Foundation]].{{r|Fear Itself: The Home Front #1}} Others joined Hydra's [[Department of Occult Armaments (Earth-616)|D.O.A.]], who was thought to have been destroyed by its own research.{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #8}}\n\nDuring the [[Cold War (Event)|Cold War]], Hydra kept on its activities, the [[Red Army Faction (Earth-616)|Red Army Faction/Baader-Meinhof Gang]], the [[German People's Union (Earth-616)|German People's Union]], [[Der Republikaners (Earth-616)|Der Republikaners]] and Neo-Nazis being some of their new faces in Germany, pursuing the goal of obtaining eternal life through science. The German Freedom League who had opposed the Thules kept fighting them, smuggling scientists under duress from their organizations.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #2}}\n\nNikolaus Geist was absorbed into Hydra by Baron Strucker, where they continued Thule's ''Infinitas Agenda''.{{r|Captain America: Hail Hydra #2|5}}\n\n{{MessageBox\n| Message = ''See '''[[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]''' for more information about the modern organization created by [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] and [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]].''\n}}\n\n===Fear Itself===\nThe Thule members placed by the Red Skull in 1942 to protect the Hammer of Skadi, in Fortress Null, tried to protect the Hammer when the Skull's daughter, [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Sin]], arrived in Antarctica to reclaim it for herself. They were finally defeated by Sin's assault forces.{{r|Fear Itself #1}}\n\nAfter Sin had successfully taken the Hammer of Skadi, she found [[Thule Security Drones (Earth-616)|Thule Society's Security Drones]] in her father's Egyptian secret base. Sin then used Thule's Drones to help her in her attempt to control the world.{{r|Fear Itself #2}}\n\nLater, after Sin's defeat, an occult neo-Nazi group composed of Thule members' descendants, the [[Hammer of Thule (Earth-616)|Hammer of Thule]], became operative in the [[United States of America|United States]], carrying on their predecessors' mission.{{r|Fear Itself: The Home Front #1|2}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = [[Thule Security Drones (Earth-616)|Thule Security Drones]]\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Axis Organizations]]"
