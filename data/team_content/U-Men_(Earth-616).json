The group believed that using stealing and grafting mutant body parts through surgery, employing unethical genetic modification procedures, and injecting mutant blood transfusions and X-hormone mutagens into their members would create the Third Species, humans empowered with mutant abilities. To that end, they have abducted and have been responsible for the deaths of many mutants for the sake of experiments and organ harvesting through illicit organ smuggling operations to make their members more like mutants. They have encountered students at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] on several occasions. \n\nDuring one of those events, U-Men were detected by [[Kuan-Yin Xorn (Earth-616)|Xorn]]'s [[Special_Class#Special_Class|special class]] and a battle ensued, whereupon [[Angel Salvadore (Earth-616)|Angel Salvadore]] destroyed a car with U-men presumably inside. On another occasion, the [[Omega Gang]], lead by [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Kid Omega]] crashed into a U-men base, during a surgical transfer of body parts, killing the half dozen members.\n\n| Equipment               = They wear suits that are suppose to keep them pure, these suits were identified as expensive.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:U-Men]]\n[[Category:Artificial Mutants]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
