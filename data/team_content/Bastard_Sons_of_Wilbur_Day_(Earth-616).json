They were tracked down by Iron Man and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] to their base of operations in a warehouse, where they unleashed the Titanomech prototype, but it was quickly destroyed due to its poor  construction.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 500}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Their manifesto reads:\n::\"''The hour is at hand!

We will strike back against the corrupt, fascist heart of super-police unchecked by morality or decency with the very weapons they oppress us with, and our revolutionary brothers and sisters around the world. His name was Wilbur Day! He was the Stilt-Man! He saw technology as a tool of equalization. But the rich white men in power said no. He was murdered in the streets like a dog. Well, surprise, super-fascists!
