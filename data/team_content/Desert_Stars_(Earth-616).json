As the team worked to help civilians during the [[Secret Invasion]], [[Charles Chandler (Earth-616)|3-D Man]] and the [[Skrull Kill Krew (Earth-616)|Skrull Kill Krew]] attacked. They reveal Desert Stars' member, the [[Blacksmith (Earth-616)|Blacksmith]], to be a [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrull]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 16}}\n\n[[File:Desert Stars (Earth-616) from Avengers The Initiative Vol 1 16 0002.png|left|thumb]]\nBlacksmith fought the Stars and the Kill Krew. The Skrull took down most of the team during the battle and sliced off one of [[Melati Kusuma (Earth-616)|Komodo]]'s arms with its shield. The Skrull was finally taken down with a laser blast which went right through Komodo and into Blacksmith. Komodo healed quickly because of her lizard regenerative powers. The rest of the Stars were all injured, but the whole team survived. Before dying, the Skrull posing as Blacksmith stated that there was a Skrull infiltrator in every Initiative team. Komodo left to help 3-D Man and the Skrull Kill Krew find the Skrulls who have infiltrated the other Initiative teams.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 16}}\n\n[[File:Desert Stars (Earth-616) from Avengers The Initiative Vol 1 16 0001.png|right|thumb]]\n==Desert Stars==\n* [[Matthew Liebowicz (Earth-616)|Two-Gun Kid]] - (Matthew Hawks), was appointed team leader. \n* [[Melati Kusuma (Earth-616)|Komodo]] - (Melati Kusuma) is a former graduate student of [[Curtis Connors (Earth-616)|Dr. Curt Connors (aka the Lizard)]].
