Stark was left in comatose state.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 299}}\n\nThe robot went on a rampage while heading to [[Futura (California)|Futura]], and [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] called together [[Harold Hogan (Earth-616)|Happy Hogan]], [[Edward March (Earth-616)|Eddie March]], [[Bethany Cabe (Earth-616)|Bethany Cabe]], [[Michael O'Brien (Earth-616)|Mike O'Brien]], and [[Clayton Wilson (Earth-616)|Carl Walker]] in order to propose to them to use old Iron Man armors in order to defeat Ultimo. With the help of [[Abraham Zimmer (Earth-616)|Abe Zimmer]], the group donned the armors and departed to fight Ultimo.\n\nWhen the team caught up with Ultimo, they deployed almost their entire arsenal, and the robot soon fell to the ground. But it recovered, and continued the battle, taking down Carl and Eddie. The four remaining members continued the battle until Mike and Happy collided with each other. War Machine ordered Happy to get Carl and Eddie to a hospital and Mike and Bethany to alert Futura of Ultimo's arrival and suggest the city to start evacuating. Bethany decided to stay with Rhodes and continue slowing Ultimo down.\n\nThe arrival of [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]], equipped with a [[Modular Armor|brand-new armor]], turned the tide of the battle, as after ordering Bethany to get clear, he faced Ultimo alone and defeated him quickly.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 300}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Iron Man Armor|Iron Man Armors]] [[Iron Man Armor Model 1|Model 1]], [[Iron Man Armor Model 2|Model 2]], [[Iron Man Armor Model 4|Model 4]], [[Iron Man Armor Model 8|Model 8]], and [[Iron Man Armor Model 9|Model 9]].\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The [[Iron Man Armor]] donned by each member of the Iron Legion was the following:\n** [[Iron Man Armor Model 1|Model 1]] (Grey Armor): [[Edward March (Earth-616)|Eddie March]]\n** [[Iron Man Armor Model 2|Model 2]] (Proto-Classic Armor): [[Harold Hogan (Earth-616)|Happy Hogan]]\n** [[Iron Man Armor Model 4|Model 4]] (Classic Armor): [[Clayton Wilson (Earth-616)|Carl Walker]]\n** [[Iron Man Armor Model 8|Model 8]] (Silver Centurion Armor): [[Michael O'Brien (Earth-616)|Mike O'Brien]]\n** [[Iron Man Armor Model 9|Model 9]] (Neo-Classic Armor): [[Bethany Cabe (Earth-616)|Bethany Cabe]]\n** [[Iron Man Armor Model 11|War Machine Armor]]: [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|Jim Rhodes]]\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
