Martin had a hard time convincing Jason, recalling him that no matter their blood, he was his dad.{{r|Inhuman #5}}\n\nJason finally joined them in their buses, but the Cloud kept pursuing them, changing direction as if it was aimed toward them. Running out of luck, the community found the road cut off by a torrent.{{r|Inhuman #5}}\n\nDespite [[Raymond (Inhuman) (Earth-616)|Raymond]]'s want to keep on, Martin abandoned the run, accepting his fate and explaining Jason that they were \"special\", just like the African group he was adopted from, as the Terrigen engulfed them all.{{r|Inhuman #5}}\n\n===[[Terrigenesis]]===\nJason was the only one to emerge from his cocoon, only to meet [[Lash (Earth-616)|Lash]] who took him to [[Orollan]].{{r|Inhuman #5}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Minnesota Inhuman Community]]"
