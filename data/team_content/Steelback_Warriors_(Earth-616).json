While D'Ken was holding his sister [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Princess Lilandra]] over false charges of treason, the [[Pathfinders (Earth-616)|Pathfinders]] attempted a rescue. The Steelback Warriors were sent by D'Ken to deal with the Pathfinders while other Warriors were ordered to kill Lilandra. However, Lilandra was able to escape her captors but discovered that D'Ken's Warriors had killed all the Pathfinders.{{r|Classic X-Men Vol 1 14}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Shi'ar Organizations]]"
