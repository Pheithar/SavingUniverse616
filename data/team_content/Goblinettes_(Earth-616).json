[[Harold & Norman Osborn (A.I.) (Earth-616)|An A.I.]] amalgamated from copies of Harry and [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman]]'s minds deployed the robots to capture Normie and exact Harry's posthumous plan. However, the plan was ultimately thwarted by the combined efforts of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Mark Raxton (Earth-616)|Molten Man]], and [[Benjamin Urich (Earth-616)|Ben Urich]]. The robots were destroyed in the process.{{r|Spider-Man: Legacy of Evil Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = [[Goblin Glider]]s\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Robotics]]\n[[Category:Robots (Full Listing)]]"
