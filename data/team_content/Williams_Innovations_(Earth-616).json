The company survived, but only as a cover operation for organized crime syndicate [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]]{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 138}} - however, Maggia covered its track so well that no-one could prove Williams Innovations' involvement in criminal activities.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 145}} Simon Williams, by then the superhero called Wonder Man of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], wrote a report about what he knew (and could not prove) of Innovations' activities, for his partners. [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] was familiar with this report.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 138}}\n\nAt a later point, the criminal [[Spymaster (Ted Calloway) (Earth-616)|Spymaster]] was hired by Maggia for several reasons. While investigating the kidnapping of [[Bethany Cabe (Earth-616)|Bethany Cabe]] by the Spymaster, Cabe's boyfriend Anthony Stark (secretly Iron Man) found a hint relating Spymaster with Williams Innovations and a company called Technical Press, Inc., headquartered in [[Derby (US)|Derby]], [[Connecticut (State)|Connecticut]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 138}} Stark went to Derby and spoiled Maggia's operations there.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 139}} However, Maggia covered its track so well that the police was unconvinced about Williams Innovations being related to the mob.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 145}}\n\nOnly one month later, Williams Innovation was cleared and it held a display booth at the 24th Annual Conclave of Electronics Engineers and Innovators, in the [[Sheraton Hotel]] of [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. Stark attended the Conclave and noticed Williams Innovations' booths; he considered investigating them, but he ended up being too busy for that.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 145}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * In {{cl|Iron Man Vol 1 138}}, Stark finds documents where Technical Press, Inc., is mentioned, including paychecks, and he immediately relates them to Williams Innovations - although the reader does not see \"Williams Innovations\" written anywhere.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
