Having grown frustrated with the rampant corruption that had been infecting the London branch of MI-6, Smith retired from active duty and developed his own firm, bringing along several of his close allies from MI-6. Among these included [[Doctor Petrie]], [[Clive Reston]], [[Black Jack Tarr]], [[Leiko Wu]] and [[Shang-Chi]]. Freelance Restorations was based out of Smith's private Scottish estate, [[Stormhaven Castle]]. Freelance Restorations often came into conflict with Shang-Chi's sister, [[Zheng Bao Yu (Earth-616)|Fah Lo Suee]], who had since taken control of MI-6. They also continued their never-ending struggle against Shang-Chi's father, the criminal mastermind, [[Fu Manchu]], and his legion of dedicated [[Si-Fan]] assassins.\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = Freelance Restorations is not to be confused with Knightwing Restorations, a private investigation firm owned by [[Misty Knight]] and [[Colleen Wing]].
