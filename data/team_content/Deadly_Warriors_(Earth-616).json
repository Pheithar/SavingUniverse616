Consisting of five members, each Warrior was associated with a unique weapon, color and Chinese element:\n\n'''Deadly Hand:''' Unarmed Combat, Red, Fire\n\n'''Deadly Staff:''' Staves, Green, Wood\n\n'''Deadly Hammer:''' War Hammers, Yellow, Earth\n\n'''Deadly Sabre:''' Blades, White, Metal\n\n'''Deadly Dagger:''' Throwing Daggers, Black, Water\n\n| History                 = \n===Origins===\nThe original Deadly Warriors were the five disciples of the sorcerer Zheng Zu and his younger brother [[Zheng Yi (Earth-616)|Zheng Yi]].  During the 18th century, the Sorcerer Brothers and the Deadly Warriors protected the [[Tianjin]] Prefecture from [[Fin Fang Foom (Earth-616)|Fin Fang Foom]].  The Sorcerer Brothers would outlive their disciples through the use of longevity spells and established five Houses in their honor after their deaths.{{r|Shang-Chi Vol 1 1}}\n\n===Opium Wars===\nIn 1860, the next lineup of Deadly Warriors were mobilized by the Society to defend [[Shanghai]] from the invading [[British Army]] during the Opium Wars.  The British sorcerer Baron Harkness summoned [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]]'s [[Mindless Ones]] to bolster the British Army, resulting in the deaths of the Deadly Warriors and fatal wounding of Zheng Yi.{{r|Shang-Chi Vol 1 4}}\n\n===Boxer Rebellion===\nIn 1900, the Five Weapons Society supported the Boxers against the Eight Nation Alliance.  Despite their efforts, the then current incarnation of the Deadly Warriors failed to protect the House of the Deadly Sabre from the Western invaders.  An enraged Zheng Zu subsequently executed the Warriors' field leader Commander Sabre for his failure while denouncing the rest the Warriors for being weak.{{r|Shang-Chi Vol 1 3}}   \n\n===Dissolution and Legacy===\nFollowing the Boxer Rebellion, Zu had four of the five Houses relocated outside of China.  The Deadly Warriors were disbanded during the Society's restructuring and were subsequently replaced by the [[House Champions (Earth-616)|House Champions]] as the elite fighting team of the Society.{{r|Shang-Chi Vol 1 3}}  \n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n\n[[Category:Chinese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Martial Arts]]"
