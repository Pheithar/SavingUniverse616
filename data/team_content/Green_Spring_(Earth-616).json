Blonsky often used pieces of his own flesh in Green Spring's experiments. When one of its test subjects named [[Dionne Fortean (Earth-616)|Dionne]] escaped, [[Skaar (Earth-616)|Skaar]], who was repowered by Green Spring, was sent to retrieve Dionne, but ran into interference by [[Gamma Flight (Alpha Flight Space Program) (Earth-616)|Gamma Flight]]. When the [[United States Hulkbuster Force (Earth-616)|United States Hulkbuster Force]] came to break up the fight, Skaar attacked the Hulkbuster Force for fun. Blonsky decided to let Skaar fight the Hulkbuster Force as a show of Green Spring's experimental capabilities.{{r|Gamma Flight Vol 1 1|2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
