Commandeering [[Ravencroft Institute]], [[Truett Hudson (Earth-616)|Professor Thorton]] and his colleagues began conducting unethical experiments on the inmates, ostensibly to create super-soldiers for the [[World War II|war effort]]; intimidating the asylum's founder, [[Jonas Ravencroft (Earth-616)|Dr. Jonas Ravencroft]], into letting them do as they wished.<!--{{r|Ruins of Ravencroft: Dracula Vol 1 1}}-->\n\nHowever, Weapon Plus' experiments proved to be failures and the test subjects mutated into grotesque vampiric monstrosities dubbed the \"Unwanted\" by the researchers. Fed up with his institute having been turned into a laboratory for mad scientists, Dr. Ravencroft unleashed the Unwanted on the Weapon Plus personnel before committing suicide. Through unknown means, the Unwanted were rounded up and locked in a seemingly empty vault in Ravencroft's basement.{{r|Ruins of Ravencroft: Dracula Vol 1 1}} Coming under the leadership of [[William Adams (Earth-616)|Lt. William \"Bud\" Adams]],{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 1}} over the decades they formed a partnership with [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] crime-lord [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Wilson Fisk]], who used them to dispose of bodies.{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 2}}\n\nDecades later, the Unwanted attacked [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]], [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|Man-Wolf]], [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]], and Fisk when the group ventured into their vault, before retreating to their lair underneath the institute.{{r|Ruins of Ravencroft: Sabretooth Vol 1 1}} As the institute was being rebuilt, the Unwanted summoned Fisk to their cell via hypnotic suggestion, Adams demanding that he run the institute as a proper mental hospital and threatening to expose what he had done as the Kingpin to the public if he refused. When Fisk refused, Adams hypnotized him into opening the vault door and had him brutally beaten.{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 2}} Over the next several weeks, the Unwanted - now free to roam the institute - spied on the guards and inmates from the ventilation system, taking an interest in John Jameson.{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 1}}\n\nFisk eventually tried to subdue the Unwanted by sending in a strike force consisting of villains and armed men. Adams tricked Fisk's forces by having an Unwanted telepath named [[Joseph (Unwanted) (Earth-616)|Joseph]] trick them into attacking telepathically-generated illusions while the Unwanted launched an invasion of Ravencroft from the institute's hidden basement.{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 3}}\n\nThe Unwanted took over the prison, took the staff prisoner, and released its prisoners. Adams then tried to force staff member [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]] to reveal to him where he hid the [[Journal of Jonas Ravencroft|journal of Jonas Ravencroft]] so he could use its secrets to see the prison shut down permanently. When Jameson refused to tell him, Adams threatened to activate the prison's self-destruct program. Jameson eventually revealed that the journal had gone missing. Adams accused him of lying and was about to interrogate staff member [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] when he learned that Fisk and his men had overcame the psychic deception and were now trying to retake the prison. Jameson then transformed into Man-Wolf and took down Adams. Afterward, Adams and the surviving Unwanted were taken by the mysterious [[J.A.N.U.S. (Earth-616)|J.A.N.U.S.]] organization to be experimented on.{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 4|5}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = The Unwanted possessed an assortment of claws, fangs, wings, tentacles, and other appendages.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Weapon Plus Projects]]\n[[Category:Ravencroft Institute Patients]]\n[[Category:Vampire Organizations]]"
