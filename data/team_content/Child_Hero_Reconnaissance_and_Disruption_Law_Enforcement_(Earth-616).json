This led formation of an organisation called C.R.A.D.L.E. (Child Hero Reconnaissance And Disruption Law Enforcement) consisting of [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]], [[Carolina Washington (Earth-616)|Carolina Washington]], [[Jacob Oh (Earth-616)|Jake Oh]], [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Speedball]], and [[Rina Patel (Earth-616)|Timeslip]] to police and enforce this law via detention of any underage young heroes who violated Kamala's Law.{{r|Outlawed Vol 1 1}}\n\nC.R.A.D.L.E. made their presence known by raiding [[Hawkeye Investigations Office|West Coast Avengers' HQ]]; and by going after superheroes like\u00a0[[Lunella Lafayette (Earth-616)|Moon Girl]]\u00a0at her home and [[Riri Williams (Earth-616)|Ironheart]] at her Chicago. They commandeer the [[Champions Mobile Bunker]] while arresting [[Amka Aliyak (Earth-616)|Snowguard]] and [[Fernanda Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Locust]], and hung wanted posters of [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] in Jersey City.{{r|Outlawed Vol 1 1}} On the day of the law passing into action, they tried to arrest newly reformed [[Power Pack (Earth-616)|Power Pack]] who had intervened to stop the [[Douglas Carmody (Robot) (Earth-616)|Boogeyman]],{{r|Power Pack Vol 4 1}} but failed due to the intervention of [[Bentley Wittman (Earth-616)|\"Agent Aether\" (The Wizard)]].{{r|Power Pack Vol 4 2}}\n\nC.R.A.D.L.E. led by\u00a0Dum Dum Dugan\u00a0approached to arrest\u00a0[[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Spider-Man]] in\u00a0Brooklyn\u00a0for violation of Kamala's Law but were defeated by Spider-Man as they underestimated him. Later,\u00a0[[Brooklyn Visions Academy]]\u00a0was put under forced inspection to locate other teen vigilantes and compel students to sign a pledge to report any vigilante activity.\u00a0[[Barbara Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Barbara Rodriguez]]\u00a0and other students protests leading to their mass arrest for refusing to sign but they were released by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Miles Morales: Spider-Man Vol 1 17}}{{r|Miles Morales: Spider-Man Vol 1 18}}\n\nAfter waking from comatose, Ms. Marvel makes an unexpected announcement that her team won't go down without a fight. C.R.A.D.L.E. receive an encrypted message from Viv about a secret gathering. C.R.A.D.L.E. led by Justice attacked the abandoned warehouse where the young superheroes had gathered to plan their next move. Justice tried to explain them the dangers of being young superheroes, but a brawl breaks between them. They arrested [[Lana Baumgartner (Earth-1610)|Bombshell]] and [[Nadia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] while others were teleported to safe place by [[Qureshi Gupta (Earth-616)|Pinpoint]].{{r|Champions Vol 4 1}}\n\nC.R.A.D.L.E. led by Dum Dum Dugan later tracked Ms. Marvel and try to arrest her in even after she had saved people from a flood. Ms. Marvel eventually escaped after defeating them. C.R.A.D.L.E. with information from [[Zoe Zimmer (Earth-616)|Zoe Zimmer]] continuously hunt for Ms. Marvel but withdrew after she and Dum Dum Dugan unlikely joined forces to defeat [[Monopoly (Earth-616)|Monopoly]].{{r|Magnificent Ms. Marvel Vol 1 15}}{{r|Magnificent Ms. Marvel Vol 1 17}}\n\nBombshell, Locust, Snowguard, and [[Tiana Toomes (Earth-616)|Starling]] were being forced in Re-education Center for brainwash by C.R.A.D.L.E. Snowguard and Bombshell managed to free themselves using their powers, but are again captured by time-traveling Timeslip. Later C.R.A.D.L.E. emerged at Chicago when protests erupted, where they encountered some active members of Champions: Ms. Marvel, [[Samuel Alexander (Earth-616)|Nova]], and Spider-Man who had been monitoring the protests. They tracked them Ironheart's home but Champions eventually escaped them.{{r|Champions Vol 4 2}}\n\nC.R.A.D.L.E. continued to hunt Champions but were forced to stop after [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] rescued his former teammates and granted them asylum at [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|Champions Vol 4 3}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Government Organizations]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]\n[[Category:Law Enforcement Agencies]]"
