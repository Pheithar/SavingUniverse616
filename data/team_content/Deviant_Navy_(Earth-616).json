From mid-sized vessels to capital ships comparable in size to the largest surface warships of the human race in the late 20th century, though none the size of super carriers.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 20}}{{r|Eternals Vol 2 3|4}} Ranging in design from saucers to winged straight-lined warships with a bridge and tower.{{r|Eternals Vol 2 2|4}} The most powerful Deviant warships, such as the Dreadnoughts possessed shields that were strong enough to permit them to ride out a thermonuclear strike.{{r|Eternals Vol 2 4}} They also possess warships that not only have the capability to travel both on the surface of the ocean and underwater, but can take to the sky.{{r|Eternals Vol 2 4}}\n\n===Thurian Age===\nDuring the final centuries of the [[Pre-Cataclysmic Age|Thurian Age]], Deviant warships and aircraft of steel swept the seas clean of mankind.{{r|Eternals Vol 1 2}} These forces contributed to the Deviant conquest of most of the Earth and the enslavement of most of humanity over 100,000 years ago.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 20}}\n\n===Modern Era===\nMillennia after the [[Great Cataclysm]], during the latter 20th century, the high priest [[Ghaur]] sent warlord [[Kro]] in search of a vial with the essence of the [[Dreaming Celestial]], Kro took an armada with him.{{r|Eternals Vol 2 2}} The Deviant fleet stretched for 100s of miles, an armada unlike any seen since the time of the [[Deviant Empire]], which consisted of submersible warships.{{r|Eternals Vol 2 3}}\n\nIt was an armada of of 1000s of warships, the most powerful being the dreadnoughts, with shields that gave them the ability to ride out a thermonuclear attack. Warships that could not only operate both on the surface of the sea and underwater, but had the ability to take to the sky.{{r|Eternals Vol 2 4}}\n\nLater the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] manipulated the [[Homo mermanus|Atlanteans]] to go to war against the Deviants. Their respective navies battled in the waters over Deviant Lemuria, until the discovery that they had been manipulated by the High Evolutionary and his detonation of a genetic bomb which threatened the two races. At which point the two fleets joined forces and together with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] attacked his underwater base.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 1 17}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Directed energy weapons (e.g. beam cannons){{r|Eternals Vol 2 4}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
