During their mercenary missions they often bicker amongst each other like young siblings often do. The two seem to have at least a minor addiction to the social networking site Facebook, and have mentioned it on several occasions. They fight with a combination of Mexican wrestling moves, as well as firearms ranging from machine guns to RPGs.{{r|Moon Knight Vol 5 #27}}\n\nDuring real live fights they will tag each other in and out of battle as if they were in a wrestling ring, much to the surprise of [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]], one of their first superhero opponents. When they were double-crossed by their employer, they decided to help Moon Knight by guarding [[Carmen Alcantara (Earth-616|Carmen Alcantara]], the woman he was protecting from her father. While Moon Knight was battling her father, they stole Alcantara's hoard of cash and gave enough to Moon Knight to allow him to restart his mission in the States.{{r|Moon Knight Vol 5 #28|#30}} \n\nRecently, the Zapata Brothers took on a mercenary job in which they got involved with an idol of theirs: [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]]. Upon their first meeting, the Brothers knocked out the Merc with a Mouth in a graveyard. When Deadpool tracked them down, they sought reconciliation and offered him a team-up. After many explosions and gunshots, the trio sat back and relaxed, as they had, according to Wilson, begun a beautiful new friendship.{{r|Deadpool Team-Up Vol 2 898}}\n\n| Equipment               = Luchador Masks\n| Transportation          = Monster Truck\n| Weapons                 = Machine Guns; RPGs\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = They love to call each other \"Bro\".\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Facebook Users]]\n[[Category:Private Military Companies]]"
