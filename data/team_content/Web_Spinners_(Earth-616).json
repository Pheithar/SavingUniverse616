They were confronted by Mercury's super-powered manager, [[Slate (Mercury Rising) (Earth-616)|Slate]]. When the Web Spinners refused to yield, Slate snapped Friendly Neighborhood's neck.\n\nThe other two Web Spinners were rescued by [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]], who gave them enough time to escape. Scarlet Spider later caught up with them to try to get them to stop their enterprise. Before the Scarlet Spider left, the Web Spinner dressed in a replica of his original costume criticized his current attire, for which Ben forced him to give him his suit.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 3}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The Web Spinners wear replicas of costumes used by Spider-Man and his allies.
