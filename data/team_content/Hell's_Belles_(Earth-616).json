They were formed by [[Silas Burr (Earth-616)|Cyber]] to commit acts of extortion, and worked for a notorious drug cartel. Shrew eventually quit the team and agreed to testify against the cartel for immunity. The Belles, upon discovering their former teammate's betrayal, sought to kill [[Marilyn Maycroft (Earth-616)|Shrew]]. The government then placed Shrew under the protection of [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]. The Belles ambushed X-Factor in a hotel, and in the ensuing battle, [[Briquette (Earth-616)|Briquette]] knocked [[Guido Carosella (Earth-616)|Strong Guy]] through the ground into the basement, where she then proceeded to force the boiler to explode. Both X-Factor and Hell's Belles fled, but met up again, at which point [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] overpowered the Belles and took them into custody.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 80|81}}\n\nAfter [[Decimation]], [[Flamb\u00e9 (Earth-616)|Flamb\u00e9]], [[Tremolo (Earth-616)|Tremolo]], and [[Vague (Earth-616)|Vague]] were all depowered.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 18}} [[Briquette (Earth-616)|Briquette]] is the only member of the Hell's Belles who retained her mutant powers.{{r|Domino Annual Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe Hell's Belles resurfaced several years later. Despite having lost their powers, Flamb\u00e9, Tremolo, and Vague operated as career criminals equipped with various weaponry. A group of young mutants found the Belles robbing a bank and managed to defeat the trio, leaving them tied up for the police.{{r|Children of the Atom Vol 1 1}}\n\nWhile imprisoned, Vague used her phone call to contact Briquette for help. Briquette broke the depowered Belles out of prison and battled the [[Children of the Atom (Earth-616)|Children of the Atom]]. The Belles were about to defeat the teens when [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] appeared and offered Flamb\u00e9, Tremolo, and Vague a spot on [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] with Briquette.{{r|Children of the Atom Vol 1 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
