Most were stopped by [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Thor]] and [[Riri Williams (Earth-616)|Ironheart]], who had been previously summoned by S.H.I.E.L.D. as back-up, and were subsequently arrested. [[Snarr (Earth-616)|Snarr]] slipped away from the fight with the crate, but was stopped and killed by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]] in the outer perimeter of the building before he could reunite with Loki.{{r|Marvel Legacy Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
