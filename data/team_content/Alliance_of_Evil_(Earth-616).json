Under his guidance, they committed several acts of mutant terrorism. Early antics by the individual Alliance members brought them to the attention of the original hero team known as [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]].{{r|X-Factor #2|4}}\n\nInitially, the team stuck together due to the mutant [[Michael Nowlan (Earth-616) |Michael Nowlan]], whose powers amplified those belonging to others with addictive effects. After Nowlan's death, the Alliance was defeated and presumably imprisoned.{{r|X-Factor #5|6}} Abandoned by Apocalypse, the members continued to operate on their own. They openly opposed the [[Mutant Registration Act]] in the streets of New York.{{r|X-Factor #33}}\n\n[[Edward Pasternak (Earth-616) |Tower]], [[Joanna Cargill (Earth-616) |Frenzy]], and [[Wendy Sherman (Earth-616) |Stinger]] briefly reunited while teaming up with [[Erika Benson (Earth-616) |Harness]] and her son, [[Gilbert Benson (Earth-616) |Piecemeal]], to gather the energies of the deceased [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616) |Proteus]] for the scientific organization, [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616) |AIM]], but they were all defeated by X-Force.{{r|New Mutants Annual #7}}{{r|New Warriors Annual #1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * Danny Wall's Unofficial Handbook to the Marvel Universe\n}}"
