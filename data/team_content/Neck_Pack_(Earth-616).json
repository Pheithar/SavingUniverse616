Needing other vampires to feed on, Nosferatu had the Neck Pack kidnap the vampire [[Charles Barnabus (Earth-616)|Charles Barnabus]] so he could experiment on him to turn him into a never-ending source of blood. They later fought Charles' allies [[Frankenstein's Monster (Earth-616)|Adam]], [[Elise Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elise]] and [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]], and [[Tomas Dluga (Earth-616)|Tomas Dluga]]. In the end, most of the Neck Pack's were killed.{{r|Bloodstone Vol 1 3|4}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
