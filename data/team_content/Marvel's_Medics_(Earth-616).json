After consulting with [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], the pair made a plan to save Death and called [[Linda Carter (Earth-616)|Night Nurse]] to assemble a team of medically trained superheroes. Night Nurse was able to recruit [[Elias Wirtham (Earth-616)|Cardiac]], [[Faiza Hussain (Earth-616)|Excalibur]], and [[Whitman Knapp (Earth-616)|Manikin]].{{r|Valkyrie: Jane Foster Vol 1 6}}\n\n[[File:Marvel's Medics (Earth-616) from Valkyrie Jane Foster Vol 1 6 001.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Assembling Marvel's Medics]]\n\nTogether, the team ventured into [[Realm of Death]] to seek out, diagnosis, and treat Death to stop the universe from breaking.{{r|Valkyrie Jane Foster Vol 1 6}} Once the team arrived at Death's palace, Excalibur used her sword to allow her teammates to pass \"[[Charon (Olympian) (Earth-616)|Charon]]\". In a gallery with only one painting, Cardiac attacked Doctor Strange to thwart the team's mission. Manikin tried to stop him in his Proto form, but Cardiac accidentally killed him. Ultimately, Jane Foster alone was left to convince the [[Death of Death (Multiverse)|Death of Death]] that the world still needed Death.{{r|Valkyrie: Jane Foster Vol 1 7}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = [[Glossary:Magic|Magical]] [[Teleportation|teleportation]]\n| Weapons                 = <br/>\n* [[Undrjarn|Undrjarn the All-Weapon]]\n* [[Cloak of Levitation]]\n* [[Eye of Agamotto]]\n* [[Excalibur (Sword)|Excalibur]]\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
