As a result, Stark lost control of Stark International, became a homeless alcoholic vagrant, and gave up his armored identity to [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|James Rhodes]], who became the new Iron Man for a lengthy period of time.{{Citation}}\n\nEventually, Stark recovered and joined a new startup, Circuits Maximus. Stark concentrated on new technological designs, including building a new set of armor as part of his recuperative therapy. Rhodes continued to act as Iron Man but steadily grew more aggressive and paranoid, due to the armor not being calibrated properly for his use. Eventually, Rhodes went on a rampage, and Stark had to don a replica of his original armor to stop him. When Circuits Maximus came under assault from Stane, Stark used the completed next-generation [[Iron Man Armor Model 8|Silver Centurion Armor]] to confront Stane in personal combat. Stark's skill proved superior over Stane's unpracticed use of his own variant suit (known as the [[Iron Monger Armor MK I|Iron Monger Armor]]). Rather than give Stark the satisfaction of taking Stane to trial, Stane committed suicide.{{Citation}}\n\nShortly thereafter, Stark regained his personal fortune, but decided against repurchasing [[Stane International]] until much later; he instead created [[Stark Enterprises]], headquartered in [[Los Angeles]].{{Citation}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Wikify]]\n[[Category:Stark Industries Subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:Companies]]"
