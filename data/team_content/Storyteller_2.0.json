As the Storytellers had been secretly sending out distress beacons to the late [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] in hopes of finding freedom, much like their elder brother [[Storyteller (Gavin) (Earth-616)|Gavin]] had thanks to the heroine. But instead they got a [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|pretender to her title]] whom just so happened to be storming their A.I.M. base at the time.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 40}}\n\nThey even attempted revitalizing the real Ms. Marvel hoping she could be their rescuer. But The resurrection process was flawed; scores of Baby M.O.D.O.C.s ended up creating several energy duplicates carrying a portion of Ms. Marvel's core anima by mistake.\n\nThe energized doppelgangers they created instead reached out to some old [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] colleagues in order to help rescue them instead. But Moonstone (then posing as Ms. Marvel) would not give them up without a fight, matters seemed to escalate with inclusion of [[Monica Rappaccini (Earth-616)|Monica]]'s A.I.M faction taking an interest in the project's contents. When they enlisted the super mercenary [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]]'s services in order to recover them for personal interests.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 41}}\n\n| Equipment               = <br> '''Advanced Life Support System'''<br> '''Hive Brain Networking'''\n\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Storyteller infants can imagine anything they envision into reality similar to their precursor Gavin.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mutates]]\n[[Category:Artificial Mutants]]\n[[Category:Bald]]\n[[Category:Modern-Age Characters]]\n[[Category:Reality Warpers]]\n[[Category:Telepaths]]"
