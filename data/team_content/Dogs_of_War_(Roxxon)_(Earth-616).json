The group also attempted to convince the armored hero [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] to leave Stark Industries and work for Republic, unaware that the armored hero was secretly Stark Industry owner Tony Stark. Later when Republic employee [[Simon Krieger (Earth-616)|Simon Krieger]] (posing as Stark) and the Dogs of War later took control of [[Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-Enforcement Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.'s]] [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier|Helicarrier]] and took a number of world leaders hostage and demanded a massive ransom. Iron Man, with the help of Stark's chauffeur [[Harold Hogan (Earth-616)|Harold \"Happy\" Hogan]] helped expose Krieger's deception and capture the Dogs of War. The fate of the Dogs of War are unknown. Krieger was murdered by an assassin under the employ of Republic to eliminate any implication in the attempt to take over Stark Industries. Republic then re-branded themselves as the notorious Roxxon Energy Corporation.{{r|Iron Man: The Iron Age #2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Roxxon Projects]]\n[[Category:Private Military Companies]]"
