Freeing [[Falcona (Earth-616)|Falcona]], [[Aireo (Earth-616)|Aireo]], [[Stallior (Earth-616)|Stallior]], [[Nebulo (Earth-616)|Nebulo]], [[Leonus (Earth-616)|Leonus]], and [[Timberius (Earth-616)|Timberius]] from their place of imprisonment with the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]'s aid, Maximus then tricked the Hulk into breaching the protective barrier guarding a forbidden chemical substance created by the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] scientist [[Romnar_(Earth-616)|Romnar]] centuries previous. This substance had certain highly unstable energy absorbing capacities and Maximus intended to use it to usurp the throne again. Black Bolt overpowered him before he could do so.{{r|Incredible Hulk Special #1}}\n\nMaximus succeeded in bringing about his second coup some months later. Drugging the [[House_of_Agon_(Earth-616)|Royal Family]] with will-deadening \"hypno-potions,\" Maximus wrested the crown from Black Bolt and had the Royal Family imprisoned.{{r|Fantastic Four #82}}Before he could activate his Hypno-Gun, which he believed would make all mankind surrender to his will, the Royal Family escaped and subdued him. Maximus' first coup had lasted several years; his second one several days.{{r|Fantastic Four #83}}\n\nEscaping Attilan with his band of renegades in a rocket, Maximus landed in the South American country of Costa Salvador, and attempted to build a will-deadening device similar to his Hypno-Gun.{{r|Incredible Hulk #119}} His plans were opposed by the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] and the United States Army. {{r|Incredible Hulk #120}} However, and he and his allies were forced to flee again.{{r|Incredible Hulk #124}}\n\nThe [[Silver Surfer]] finds himself attacked by the evil Inhumans led by Maximus, who succeeded in making the Surfer believe that the Inhumans as a whole are responsible for the attack.{{r|Silver Surfer #18}}\n\nLater [[Leonus (Earth-616)|Leonus]], [[Falcona (Earth-616)|Falcona]] and [[Stallior (Earth-616)|Stallior]] were brainwashed by [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]] into being members of the [[Crimson Cadre (Earth-616)|Crimson Cadre]] who were also under his thrall at this time.{{r|Quicksilver #6}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Inhuman Organizations]]"
