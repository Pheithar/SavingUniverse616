It is a fleet that is so vast that the sheer numbers of ships overwhelms the mind. A vast variety of starships, from those that are scarred and pitted, millions of years old. To those that are newer, shining, with elegant curves and smooth lines. Some are nearly comical ships, the pieces and fragments of former ships, which have been strapped and bolted together. \n\nWhen it was learned that the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] had Galactus at their mercy and they saved his life, [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] was taken captive to face the judgement of the Survivors' fleet and various interstellar races (e.g. the [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]] and the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]]). Due to the testimony of [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]] he was set free.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 261|262}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Warp-capable Interstellar Ships\n| Weapons                 = Directed energy weapons\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Interstellar Fleets]]"
