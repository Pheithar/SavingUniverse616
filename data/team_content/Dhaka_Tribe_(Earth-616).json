During [[World War II]], their loyalty was bought by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazis]], who installed their agent [[Kurt Mueller (Earth-616)|Kurt Mueller]] as leader of the island. The tribe called Mueller \"Kuoli\" which meant \"King of the Islands\" in their native tongue. The tribe was also convinced to worship [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Adolf Hitler]] as a god.\n\nMueller briefly posed as U.S. military lieutenant Conroy in order to steal plans. Crashing his plane carrying Colonel Carter, [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]], and [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|James Barnes]], he attempted to pilfer secret plans that were being sent to [[Singapore]]. Attempting to eliminate Carter, he faced Rogers and Barnes in their costumed guises of Captain America and Bucky. Cap and Bucky were able to hold their own against the Dhaka Tribal warriors until Mueller was thrown into their sacrificial flame. Shortly thereafter, the Navy stormed the island and the tribe members who refused to surrender were gunned down.{{r|All Winners Comics #2}}\n\nIf any members of the Dhaka tribe survived the massacre or if the group continues to operate into the modern era remains unrevealed. \n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = The Dhaka tribe uses primitive weapons such as spears, daggers and swords.\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Tribes]]\n[[Category:Jack Kirby/Creator]]\n[[Category:Joe Simon/Creator]]"
