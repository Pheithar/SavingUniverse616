Dr. Loss would become allied with Ingenuity Lee to form The House of Blue Lights within New York City to devise several occult and mystical items not exempt with the drug Sacrament K, a mind-controlling drug that is made from essence of angels, which would be used to collect and control derelicts of New York on the Asura's behalf. This drug would be used onto the [[Gabriel (Devil-Hunter) (Earth-616)|Devil-Hunter Gabriel Rosetti]] to kill select Satanic cults such as the [[Ambassat (Earth-616)|Ambassat]] by killing its patrons and burning down their temple. The Asura would personally arrive to set their assassinations against Satanic priest [[Anton Devine (Earth-616)|Anton Devine]] until interventions for his protection would be made by [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]] and religious terrorist [[Jaine Cutter (Earth-616)|Jaine Cutter]] as the two would battle variant demons and demon-gods in the process.{{citation}}\n\nIn [[Bend Sinister]], Utah, the possible Asura [[Tzadqiel (Earth-616)|Tzadqiel]] would possess one of three Satanists to the Church of Lucifer to gain their souls in an abandoned cabin which would gain intervention by Daimon Hellstrom as to incite a spell to trap the four essences in the house indefinitely until the angel killed the three and committed suicide in a result of madness.{{citation}}\n\nGabriel the Devil Hunter would soon target Daimon Hellstrom after infiltrating Jaine Cutter's apartment to steal her [[Breathing Gun]] - a mystical gun able to kill demons- then infiltrate Daimon's home at Fire Lake, Massachusetts to injure Daimon's shoulder then damage his [[Hellstrom's Trident|trident]]. Hellstorm would set to retaliate this intrusion by bringing Gabriel Rosetti into his home, which contained spells to prohibit the essences and presence of angels to enter his property as to instill the removal of Sacrament K from Rosetti's body inducing the witch-hunter into a near fatal cripple from drug withdrawal. Infuriated with the threats upon his life, Hellstorm infiltrated the House of Lights to encounter Stephen Loss once more to kill the Devil-Breaker, burn his home with the mystical artifacts within, and disable the prospects of the Asura for the time being.{{citation}}\n\n====[[Heaven's on Fire]]====\nWhen the [[Black Host (Earth-616)|Black Host]] of [[Zadkiel (Earth-616)|Zadkiel]] attacked Heaven, the Asura confronted him and asked him to stand down in exchange for an exile into the [[Ninth Circle of Hell]]. He refused, and the Asura submerged him for an instant, though he slaughtered them all and went out of the fight mostly unscathed.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 6 30}}\n\n| Equipment               = Sacrament \"K\": A mind controlling drug made of the essences of angels.{{citation}}\n| Transportation          = Teleportation,{{citation}} flight by wings.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 6 30}}\n| Weapons                 = Swords,{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 6 30}} daggers,{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 6 30}} select mystical tomes and arcane knowledge.{{citation}}\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = The Asura perceive themselves as soldiers, while [[Zadkiel (Earth-616)|Zadkiel]] saw only cutthroats and assassins among them.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 6 30}}\n| Links                   = [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/asuraa.htm The Asura on the Marvel Appendix]\n}}\n[[Category:Angels of Heaven Organizations]]"
