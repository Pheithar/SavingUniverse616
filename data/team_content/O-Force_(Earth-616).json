After finalizing the team of [[Overkill (O-Force) (Earth-616)|Overkill]], [[Milton Peterson (Earth-616)|Obituary]], [[Ocean (Earth-616)|Ocean]], [[Ocelot (O-Force) (Earth-616)|Ocelot]], [[Ooze (Earth-616)|Ooze]] and [[Orbit (O-Force) (Earth-616)|Orbit]] they were sent on their first mission to rescue kidnapped celebrities.{{r|X-Statix #1}} However, unknown to the audience, the kidnapping was staged and they \"rescued\" the celebrities and killed the kidnappers (which the kidnappers didn't know would be the outcome). Solomon was approached by a police contact (who had been nudged by [[Spike (Freeman) (Earth-616)|Spike]] of [[X-Statix (Earth-616)|X-Statix]]) to get O-Force to investigate the town now under the control of [[Arnold Lundberg (Earth-616)|Arnie Lundberg]].{{r|X-Statix #2}} \n\nO'Sullivan began to brief O-Force on this mission but was interrupted by [[Guy Smith (Earth-616)|Orphan]], who attempted to warn O-Force how dangerous their next mission was. However, they ignored him and Orphan and O-Force fought until Ocean was able to hold him off with her water powers. O-Force then traveled to Arnie's town and began a live broadcast, which was seen by Arnie. In response, Arnie blew off Ocean's legs and he raised a [[Zombie]] army against them. The team were seemingly overwhelmed and Overkill fled, leaving Ocean to die at the hands of the zombies.{{r|X-Statix #3}} \n\nOcean was rescued by Orphan and the zombie threat was neutralized by the rest of X-Statix. After Arnie was stopped, he healed the injured O-Force member's. Back in New York, O'Sullivan was accousted by angry fans who suspected everything (including the teams powers) were staged.{{r|X-Statix #4}} The exploits of the team are this are unknown but it is presumed to have disbanded.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * [[Dee Milo (Earth-616)|Venus Dee Milo]] was offered membership under a contract with [[Solomon O'Sullivan (Earth-616)|Solomon O'Sullivan]], but the contract was broken under Venus and Spike pressure, as the O-Force was about to be annihilated except for the intervention of [[X-Statix (Earth-616)|X-Statix]] using Venus' teleportation (prohibited by the contract).\n* It was said that O-Force mutant powers were possibly only special effects,{{r|X-Statix Vol 1 4}} but [[Ocean (Earth-616)|Ocean]] demonstrated her powers on the [[Guy Smith (Earth-616)|Orphan]] earlier.{{r|X-Statix Vol 1 3}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/oforcexs.htm\n}}\n[[Category:Media-Driven Teams]]"
