In order to replace them and as Angel didn't wanted to run his company but rather help new mutants, he recruited for his new board [[Victor Borkowski (Earth-616)|Anole]], [[Ruth Aldine (Earth-616)|Blindfold]], [[Roxanne Washington (Earth-616)|Bling!]] and [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]], his pals from A.P.
