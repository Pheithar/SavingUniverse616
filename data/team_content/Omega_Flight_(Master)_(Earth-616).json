Their individual origins (beyond [[Werner Schmidt (Brain Drain) (Earth-616)|Brain Drain]]) have yet to be revealed.\n\nThey first encountered Alpha Flight when Alpha faced the [[Hardliners (Earth-616)|Hardliners]] in combat for the life of [[Albert Louis (Earth-616)|Albert Louis]]. They had, however, faced [[Beta Flight (Earth-616)|Beta Flight]] before that.\n\nDuring the [[Infinity War]], the Master launched a plan to release the [[Ska'r|Ska'ar]] into [[Toronto]], in a bid to stop the mental assimilation launched by the [[Magus (Earth-7528)|Magus]]. Beta Flight was able to resist the maddening influence of the Ska'ar thanks to their mage, [[Ananym (Earth-616)|Witchfire]]. Realizing they would attempt to stop his plans, the Master set Omega Flight against them. The Betas, along with [[Colin Hume (Earth-616)|Windshear]], were able to defeat Omega Flight, but the Master defeated them. The Ska'ar were forced back into their dimension when they turned on the Master.\n\nOmega Flight was later used by the Master against Alpha Flight after he had tired Alpha Flight out by manipulating them into facing the [[Hardliners (Earth-616)|Hardliners]]. During the battle, the Master of the World grew frustrated and attempted to kill both Alpha and Omega Flight but his effort was disrupted when [[Walter Langkowski (Earth-616)|Sasquatch]] threw [[William Knox (Earth-616)|Sinew]] at him. This disruption allowed Alpha Flight to rally for a period and defeat Omega Flight and, eventually, the Master. Omega Flight, defeated, seemed to disband. Some of its members have been seen since but most have remained either in hiding or in prison.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 130}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * Not related to the first [[Omega Flight (Jaxon) (Earth-616)|Omega Flight]] or the [[Omega Flight (Heroes) (Earth-616)|team of heroes by the same name]].\n| Links                   = \n}}"
