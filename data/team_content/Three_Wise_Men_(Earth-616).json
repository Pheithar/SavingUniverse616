Herod's priests sent them to [[Bethlehem]], and Herod asked them to bring the news, so he could also come and worship him. Following the star, they eventually found [[Mary of Nazareth (Earth-616)|Mary]], [[Joseph of Nazareth (Earth-616)|Joseph]] and Jesus, and gave him the gifts.<!-- {{r|Bible Tales for Young Folk #1}} -->\n\nLater in the night, an [[Angels of Heaven|angel]] came to them in a dream and warned them not to return to Herod but to leave in another way.{{r|Bible Tales for Young Folk #1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Biblical Times Characters]]"
