Yet the lore of both organizations told of a golden age when the two organizations had been one unified guild in an antediluvian realm known only \"the old kingdom\"... and a prophecied day when the two Guilds would unite. The prophecy specified one being who would bring them together: a being known as \"Le Diable Blanc\".\n\nAs the two organizations were slowly whittled by the pressures of the modern world, they both acquired new leaders: Remy Lebeau became head of the Thieves Guild, while Bella Donna Boudreaux became leader of the Assassins Guild. When the New Son put a contract on Remy Lebeau(as part of a larger scheme), the Assassins Guild vied for the contract. When Lebeau was trapped in a wrecked building with Boudreaux, she admitted the truth - the Assassins had not been part of New Son's plan, and she had used the contract as an excuse to be close to him. With this, the two leaders renewed their marriage (which had been \"annulled\" years earlier when Bordreaux had been killed by her mad brother). With their leaders united, the two guild formed one organization.\n\nThe actions of the Guild are unknown, but Lebeau was ousted as leader of the organization after he spent too much time with the X-Men. The Unified Guild was seemingly shattered, as the [[Assassins Guild (Earth-616)|Assassins]] were later seen working on their own.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 3}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * [[Thieves Guild (Earth-616)|Thieves Guild]] \n* [[Assassins Guild (Earth-616)|Assassins Guild]]\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
