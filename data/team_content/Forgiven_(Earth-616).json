After a brief duel over the hammer, Raizo agreed to hand it over.{{r|Fear Itself: The Fearless #2}}\n\nThe Forgiven later greeted [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]] following her crash landing while trying to disable a [[Sentinels|Sentinel]]{{r|X-Men Vol 3 #23}} and sought to help her overcome her need for human blood, as they had been helped themselves by Raizo.{{r|X-Men Vol 3 #24}} \n\nWhen confronted by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], the two teams briefly battled before Jubilee separated them, just in time for [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] to arrive with the [[Zapata Brothers (Earth-616)|Zapata Brothers]], the first of many assassins arriving to kill Raizo.{{r|X-Men Vol 3 #25}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Fear Itself]]\n[[Category:Vampire Organizations]]"
