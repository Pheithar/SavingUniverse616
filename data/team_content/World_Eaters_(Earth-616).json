The light of the tree while bright also casted shadows were dark things conspired for the brightest flame of the World Tree. World Eaters are on of those vile things, a race of beings from beyond the veil of space-time where a starving universe existed. The universe though dying was kept alive due to the willpower of [[Uthana Thoth (Earth-616)|Uthana Thoth]]. When [[Asgard (Realm)|Asgard]] was brought to [[Earth-616|Earth]] in [[Broxton]], it left a void allowing the World Eaters to breach the walls of the universe and open a way into the Nine Worlds.{{r|Thor Vol 1 616}}\n\nThe World Eaters wasted not time and began invading the realms, starting with [[Nidavellir]]. There they were disappointed as they only slaughtered a few dwarven seers who had foreseen them coming and ordered their people to evacuate.{{r|Thor Vol 1 617}} Uthana Thoth though was pleased that denizens of the Nine Realms knew of them and were afraid. Other realms the World Eaters invaded were not so lucky. The invaders killed all that stood in their way, and only spoke one recognizable world: Asgard causing many refugees to gather at the ruins of Asgard in Broxton.{{r|Thor Vol 1 618}} \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
