They are A.I.M.'s own team of superheroes.{{r|U.S.Avengers Vol 1 1}}\n\nU.S.Avengers joined forces with the main [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] team and the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]] due to a global crisis caused by a cosmic contest between two [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elders of the Universe]], the [[En Dwi Gast (Earth-616)|Grandmaster]] and the [[Challenger (Elder of the Universe) (Earth-616)|Challenger]]; a game during which the [[Earth]] was teleported away from the Solar System.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 675}} Most of the world's heroes were placed in stasis, including [[Doreen Green (Earth-616)|Squirrel Girl]] and [[Aikku Jokinen (Earth-616)|Enigma]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 676}} Enigma was freed from stasis when Red Wolf was abducted and taken to the Grandmaster's [[Grandmaster's Cosmic Game Room|Cosmic Game Room]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 682|683}} During a fight with a resurrected [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], Enigma's [[Pod Undersuit|Enigma Suit]] was rendered inoperable, and [[Robert Maverick (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]] was depowered.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684|685}}\n\nNear the conflict's end, Citizen V saw himself forced to switch off his regulator headband and use his powers to help keep a device named the [[World-Engine]] running, since it maintained the Earth's conditions and prevented the planet from crumbling. After Quicksilver's actions freed the heroes still in stasis, Squirrel joined Cannonball and many other heroes in fighting the Challenger{{r|Avengers Vol 1 688}} and were eventually successful in defeating him.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 689}} Bobby's actions with the World-Engine tentatively took off many years off his life, so he decided to dissolve the U.S.Avengers and return to his roots since he didn't know how much he had left.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 690}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D.
