I based the names on an eastern variation (five tone) of the familiar Musical scale (seven tone) doh, ray, me, fah, soh, lah and te. Fourteen years ago, when I did all of the research for the Clandestine, I used a reference library, with actual books, and the only record I have of the scale is a handwritten note. I believe my note to be accurate but I haven\u2019t been able to discover any information that matches my list, of the eastern tonal progression, in any online search. I\u2019d be interested in any information that might point me in the right direction.\"''{{r|{{cite web|url=http://www.alandavis-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=311&p=2028&hilit=thaddeus#p2028|title=Adam, Albert, and an Omegan Questions|work=alandavis-forum.com|first=Alan|last=Davis|date=6 August 2005|accessdate=30 June 2021}}}}\n| Links                   = \n}}"
