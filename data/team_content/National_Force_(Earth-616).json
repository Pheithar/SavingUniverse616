Faustus took control of their minds in an attempt to use them against the original [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], rechristening the McCarthy-era stand-in as \"The Grand Director\", leader of \"The National Force\".{{r|Captain America Vol 1 231}}\n\nWhile working as a [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] liaison with the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]], [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]] investigated and infiltrated the organization. During one of the National Force's battles with street criminals in [[Harlem]], the National Guard was brought in. Under the effects of a mind-altering gas, Sharon apparently activated a self-destruct device in her National Force uniform, giving the appearance of accidental self-immolation. Rogers was shown the event on videotape.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 232}}\n\nAfter being defeated in battle by Cap and [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], the Grand Director also apparently committed suicide.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 234|236}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Roger McKenzie/Creator]]\n[[Category:Sal Buscema/Creator]]"
