It was headquartered in a [[Stark Unlimited HQ|skyscraper]] located in [[Washington Square Park]].{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 1}} Stark Unlimited also served as a conglomerate, absorbing as subsidiaries several other Stark companies, such as [[Stark Solutions (Earth-616)|Stark Solutions]], [[Stark Resilient (Earth-616)|Stark Resilient]] and [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark International]].{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 5}}\n\nAfter Tony Stark was delegitimized since his current body had been engineered from scratch, making him an artificial being, his adoptive brother [[Arno Stark (Earth-616)|Arno]] laid claim to Stark Unlimited because the bio-restructuring pod used to build Tony's body was of his design, making Tony and all his inventions his property as well. Stark Unlimited was merged with Arno's other company, [[Baintronics Incorporated (Earth-616)|Baintronics]]. In the process, head of security [[Bethany Cabe (Earth-616)|Bethany Cabe]] was fired, and [[United States Armed Forces (Earth-616)|Armed Forces]] liaison [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|Jim Rhodes]] resigned.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 19}}\n\nTony Stark eventually regained control of the company after the fall of Arno and Bain. Believing that the company had too much baggage due to its association with Baintronics, Tony decided to give the company's headquarters to [[Andrew Bhang (Earth-616)|Andy Bhang]] to use it for [[Bhang Robotics (Earth-616)|Bhang Robotics]].{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 6}} Stark Unlimited continued operating on its own, albeit without Stark's intervention since he divested himself of the company.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 1}}\n\n==Executives and Staff==\n* [[Andrew Bhang (Earth-616)|Andy Bhang]] - Chief Roboticist{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 4}}\n\n[[Stark Unlimited (Earth-616)/Members|List of Minor Stark Unlimited Members]]\n\n==Former Executives==\n* [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] - Chief Executive Officer{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 1}}\n* [[Bethany Cabe (Earth-616)|Bethany Cabe]] - Head of Security{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 1}}\n* [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta Pym]] - Chief Robotic Ethicist{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 1}}\n* [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|Col.
