Though hurt, Diamondback escaped, displaying previously unseen superhuman strength and speed.{{r|Defenders Vol 5 2}} Diamondback was finally defeated by Iron Fist when Stryker attacked him and Jessica while they were on a stake-out. Stryker was arrested but escaped while being transported.{{r|Defenders Vol 5 4}} The Defenders tracked him down and defeated him even though he had ingested the power-bestowing drug [[Diamond (Drug)|Diamond]], leading to Diamondback's second arrest.{{r|Defenders Vol 5 6}}\n\nShortly afterwards, the entirety of [[Manhattan]] became trapped below a [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]] dome cast by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] as part of their plan to neutralize the American superhero community when they took over the [[United States of America|United States]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} The Defenders were among the heroes fighting tooth and nail to fend off against Darkforce demons and assist the inhabitants of the island with the diminishing resources available.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 2}} When the Darkforce dome was finally destroyed,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 8}} the Defenders joined the last stand against Hydra in [[Washington, D.C.]]{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}} after which the heroes eventually triumphed.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}}\n\nThe Defenders then were present at Diamondback's trial, from which he walked away free thanks to a lawyer provided by his secret backer, the former Kingpin of crime [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Wilson Fisk]].{{r|Defenders Vol 5 6}} Jessica enlisted [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]]'s help to find Diamondback while Daredevil interrogated [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra Natchios]], who had returned to New York hired by yet another mysterious party to find Stryker.{{r|Defenders Vol 5 7}} After subduing the Punisher, who was spying on the team, and beating up Deadpool over his usual shenanigans, the Defenders learned [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|The Hood]] had entered the race to become the new Kingpin.{{r|Defenders Vol 5 8}} The Defenders confronted Diamondback outside a club he had taken over from [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]], and he revealed he had gathered a group of superhumans on his own to rival the Defenders, these villains were the [[Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|Fixer]], [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]] and [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Moonstone]]. Luke Cage went toe-to-toe against Dimaondback while the rest of the Defenders defeated the supervillains. Stryker was finally taken down by the Black Cat, who shot him repeatedly in the back with an automatic rifle, though she didn't kill him.{{r|Defenders Vol 5 9}}\n\nWith Stryker taken care of, the Defenders turned their attention to The Hood, who had seized Diamondback's operations following his defeat. Thanks to intel provided by the Black Cat, the Defenders attacked The Hood in his own penthouse, but he managed to fend them off before escaping. In preparation for their next encounter against Robbins, the Defenders gathered numerous allies, and attacked him while he was holding a meeting with other supervillains he wanted to draw into an alliance.{{r|Defenders Vol 5 10}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The closest thing this team had to an official coming into being was Daredevil simply suggesting they actively worked together in {{cl|Defenders Vol 5 1}}.
