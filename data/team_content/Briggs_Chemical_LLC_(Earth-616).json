(Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]], [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] recruited young people with powers in order to make them the next generation of superheroes under his control. Some he pushed and tortured in order to develop their powers. Once Norman was out out power, the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] went through his files and found the most dangerous, those who has failed their psych profiles, and who had the power to destroy city blocks. The Avengers determined to train these kids to prevent them from becoming dangerous supervillains.{{r|Avengers Academy #1|#6}}\n\nHowever, some did not accept the Avengers offers. Instead of joining the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]], [[Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616)|Jeremy Briggs]] decided to form his own multinational humanitarian cooperation with the goal of improving the world through alternative means and escaping from the \"good guy/bad guy\" binary thinking.{{r|Avengers Academy #14.1}}\n\n===Vs. Avengers Academy===\nMonths after the Avengers Academy formed, Briggs approached the students in order to manipulate them into joining him. They refused and animosity quickly grew between Briggs and the students.

The two groups parted on uneasy terms, but agreed to work together as needed in the future.{{r|Avengers Academy #26}}\n\nFollowing Jeremy Briggs' death,{{r|Avengers Academy #37}} the fate of the team is unrevealed.\n\n==Members==\n* [[Jeremy Briggs (Earth-616)|Jeremy Briggs]]{{r|Avengers Academy #14.1}}\n* Kelly{{r|Avengers Academy #14.1}}\n* [[Madeline Berry (Earth-616)|Veil (Maddy Berry)]]{{r|Avengers Academy #20}}\n* [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]]{{r|Avengers Academy #25}}\n* [[Melati Kusuma (Earth-616)|Komodo (Melati Kusuma)]]{{r|Avengers Academy #26}}\n* [[Roger Brokeridge (Earth-616)|Hardball (Roger Brokeridge)]]{{r|Avengers Academy #26}}\n* [[Abigail Boylen (Earth-616)|Cloud-9 (Abby Boylen)]]{{r|Avengers Academy #26}}\n* [[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Prodigy (Richard Gilmore)]]{{r|Avengers Academy #26}}\n* [[Robert Farrell (Earth-616)|Rocket Racer (Robert Farrell)]]{{r|Avengers Academy #26}}\n* [[Autonomously Decisive Automated Mechanism (Earth-616)|Machine Teen (Adam Aaronson)]]{{r|Avengers Academy #26}}\n* [[Lisa Molinari (Earth-616)|Coat of Arms (Lisa Molinari)]]{{r|Avengers Academy #34}}\n* [[Amity Hunter (Earth-616)|Big Zero (Amity Hunter)]]{{r|Avengers Academy #34}}\n* [[Sylvie Lushton (Earth-616)|Enchantress (Sylvie Lushton)]]{{r|Avengers Academy #34}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
