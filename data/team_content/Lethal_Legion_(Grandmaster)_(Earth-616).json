Otherwise, the Grandmaster would return them to certain death.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 681}}\n\nThe objective of the contest was to each round secure a set of [[Pyramoids]] placed by each team's rulers somewhere on [[Earth]], which served as the battleground.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 678}} Before the contest formally started, both teams were teleported to Earth in order to survey it. However, both butted heads as soon as they reached the planet. The confrontation was cut short by their masters, who reminded them they were not to fight yet.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 676}}\n\n[[File:Lethal Legion (Grandmaster) (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 1 681 002.jpg|thumb|left]]\nWhen the contest started, both teams were divided in half to confront each other in order to secure the Pyramoids. The [[Gh'Ree and R'Hos Blood (Earth-616)|Blood Brothers]], [[Mentacle (Earth-616)|Mentacle]] and [[Molyn (Earth-616)|Metal Master]] fought [[Supergiant (Earth-616)|Supergiant]], [[Black Dwarf (Earth-616)|Black Dwarf]] and [[Yabbat Ummon Turru (Earth-1365)|Black Swan]] in [[Rome (Italy)|Rome]], [[Italy]] while [[Glah-Ree (Earth-616)|Captain Glory]], [[Drall (Earth-616)|Drall]] and [[Ferene (Earth-616)|Ferene the Other]] faced [[Ebony Maw (Earth-616)|Ebony Maw]], [[Proxima Midnight (Earth-616)|Proxima Midnight]] and [[Corvus Glaive (Earth-616)|Corvus Glaive]] in Cusco, [[Peru]]. Both confrontations were intercepted by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 677}} The Pyramoid in Rome was obtained by the Black Order's Black Dwarf, while the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] of the Avengers seized the other.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 678}} Anyone who touched a Pyramoid was seemingly disintegrated, but was actually teleported to the Grandmaster's Cosmic Game Room without anyone's knowledge. With the round over, both teams left.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 679}}\n\nFor the second round, only Ferene the Other travelled to one of the Pyramoid sites, [[Antarctica]], and secured the device after one of the groups of Avengers had routed the Black Order.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 680}} The rest of the Lethal Legion attempted to retrieve the Pyramoid from [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]],{{r|Avengers Vol 1 681}} but were stopped by the other group of Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 682}} Mentacle used her powers to obfuscate the Avengers' vision in order to give herself and Captain Glory a widow of opportunity to escape, since all of their other teammates had been knocked down. As they were making their escape, they were intercepted by the Challenger's secret player, the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]]. After he broke Glory's spine, Mentacle tried to reach into his mind to no avail, and was taken down by the monster.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 684}}\n\nFollowing the end of the contest and the Avengers' victory over the Challenger, the Lethal Legion regrouped and escaped to [[Knowhere]]. Since they all were facing near-death situations when the Grandmaster recruited them, none of them had nowhere to return. They decided to stay together and see what could their combined power accomplish.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 690}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * [[Al Ewing]] has been credited with coming up with Captain Glory, Metal Master and the name of Mentacle.
