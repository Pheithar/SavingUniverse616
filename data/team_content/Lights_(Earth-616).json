Under the direction of Hope and with the consent of [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], the Lights began training as a rescue team for any other new mutant manifestations.{{r|Generation Hope #5}}\n\n===First Mission===\nWhile still settling into life on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]], and experimenting with their powers, the Lights were called to their first mission: investigating a new mutant manifestation in [[Berlin]].{{r|Generation Hope #6}} Although they encountered some setbacks, the team was able to pull together, convinced the [[Sixth Light (Earth-616)|''Sixth Light'']] to be born, stabilized his powers, and saved Berlin from his mind control.{{r|Generation Hope #7}}\n\n===Teon's Trial===\nWhen the team arrived back from [[Germany]], they were greeted by the news that the Maciks wanted their son [[Teon Macik (Earth-616)|Teon]] back. While awaiting the trial and in an effort to distract her team from the looming legal proceedings, Hope insisted on adopting codenames. Later, despite his normally animalistic nature, Teon eloquently offered a sound case of why he needed to stay with Hope and the X-Men. Immediately after the trial, [[Laurie Tromette (Earth-616)|Laurie]] and [[Kenji Uedo (Earth-616)|Kenji]] speculated on the reason all of the Lights (themselves included) seemed to be so drawn to following Hope.{{r|Generation Hope #8}}\n\n===Second Mission===\nAfter the events in Germany and Teon's trial, Hope and her team continued to train and prepare for more new mutant activations around the world. Thanks to the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] monitoring in [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]], Hope and the Lights were alerted almost immediately of the activation of the [[Zeeshan (Earth-616)|Seventh Light]]'s powers. They left quickly, but arrived just after Zee had committed suicide. The whole team took the death very hard.{{r|Generation Hope #9}}\n[[File:Lights (Earth-616) from Generation Hope Vol 1 12 001.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hope refusing to let Oya leave]]\n\n===Schism and Regenesis===\nAfter [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Kid Omega]]'s attack on the [[United Nations]], anti-mutant sentiment began to rise and world leaders began reactivating [[Sentinels]].{{r|X-Men: Schism #1}} Meanwhile, in [[San Francisco]], [[Sadie Sinclair (Earth-616)|Mayor Sinclair]] expedited the grand opening of the '''[[Museum of Mutant History]]'''. Unfortunately, [[Kade Kilgore (Earth-616)|Kade Kilgore]] and his [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] used this opportunity to attack the X-Men. Despite Wolverine's objections, Cyclops ordered [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Idie]] to stop the Hellfire Club by killing them. These event lead to a giant super-Sentinel nearly destroying Utopia, and Cyclops and Wolverine parting ways because of philosophical differences.{{r|X-Men: Schism #2|5}}{{r|Generation Hope #10|11}}\n\nThe one thing Cyclops and Wolverine could agree on was Idie would be better off away from Utopia, so despite Hope's objections Idie left with Wolverine and others to resettle [[Westchester County|Westchester]].{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}}{{r|Generation Hope #12}}\n[[File:Lights (Earth-616) from Generation Hope Vol 1 13 002.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Hope's new Lights]]\n\nAlready emotionally drained, tempers flared after Hope interrupted a kiss between [[Megan Gwynn (Earth-616)|Pixie]] and [[Gabriel Cohuelo (Earth-616)|Gabriel]]. Later, Hope convinced Pixie to join the team to help them solve their transportation problem to prevent another Zeeshan from occurring.{{r|Generation Hope #12}} [[Martha Johansson (Earth-616)|No-Girl]] also joined the team, invited by Kenji.{{r|Generation Hope #13}}\n\nGetting anxious to find a new mutant, Hope misinterpreted a light near the [[China|Chinese]] border of [[Pakistan]] as a new mutant manifestation. Hope assembled her team, but when they arrived they found an amnesiac [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]] strapped to a suicide bomb.{{r|Generation Hope #13}} During the explosion No-Girl's tank was damaged leaving her unsustained and exposed. However, Zero acted quickly and created a body for her. The team narrowly escaped with Shaw from [[Jin Billion (Earth-616)|Jin Billion]] and his Butchers.{{r|Generation Hope #14}}\n\nShaw's return to Utopia caused high tensions. While [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma]] and Cyclops debated the fate of Shaw, several former [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] confronted the Lights. To end the feuding, Hope forcibly took control of and pushed Zero's powers to their limits without his permission and much to his disapproval.{{r|Generation Hope #15|#16}}\n\n[[File:Lights (Earth-616) 003.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Lights after the death of Zero]]\n\nWhile Hope studied the information about Shaw's past given to her by Cyclops, Zero began to finalize his plans to betray and murder Hope.{{r|Generation Hope #16}} For weeks Zero had been telepathically and subtly turning Utopians against Hope. Zero was even able to influence Emma into telepathically distracting Cyclops. As mind-controlled mutants converged on Hope, the remaining Lights came to her aid. The Lights fought off the other mutants as Hope and No-Girl combined their powers to kill Zero.{{r|Generation Hope #17}}\n\nDuring a debriefing session, Shaw was fully inducted and the group reconciled some of the problems they had been facing.{{r|Generation Hope #17}}\n\nWhen the [[Peak VII]] suffered a massive break-out of alien prisoners, [[Unit (Earth-616)|Unit]] mimicked the signature of a new Light, forcing Hope to separate from her Extinction Team duty to assemble her Lights and go on rescue. Soon realizing the trap, Laurie and the other were teleported by Pixie while under Unit's control, and put to sleep by his powers.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 9}}\n\n[[File:Younger X-Men (Earth-616) from Avengers Academy Vol 1 29 0001.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Lights and the younger X-Men placed into the custody of the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]]]]\n\n===Avengers vs. X-Men===\nWhen the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] arrived enforce on Utopia to take Hope into custody before the arrival of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]], Cyclops and the X-Men forcibly tried to stop them. During the melee, Hope escaped, but the Lights and young X-Men were left as Cyclops and many of his X-Men fled. Not wanting the younger X-Men to join the war, the Avengers decided to quarantine them at the [[Avengers Compound]] with the [[Avengers Academy (Earth-616)|Avengers Academy]].{{r|Avengers Academy #29}} However, the teenage mutants didn't want to remain in custody, and were eventually allowed to leave.{{r|Avengers Academy #30|#31}} The Lights returned to Utopia in search of Hope,{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 #13}} but when they couldn't find her they joined the other young mutants in [[Westchester County|Westchester]] at [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Jean Grey School For Higher Learning]].{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men #15}}\n\n[[File:Lights (Earth-616) from Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 15 0001.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Oya showing her old teammates around the new school]]\n\nThe Lights were functionally disbanded with the departure of Hope and the enrolment of the remaining members into the Jean Grey School.{{r|Wolverine & the X-Men #15}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n|

(Earth-616)|Hope]] made it clear she was not part of the team and was to serve in a purely advisory capacity.{{r|Generation Hope #6}}\n\n[[File:Lights (Earth-616) 006.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Five new

were first made aware of the Lights in {{cl|X-Men: Second Coming #2}}, the first Light appeared on panel in {{cl|Uncanny X-Men #526}}, worked as a team through much of {{cl|Uncanny X-Men #526}}-{{cl|Uncanny X-Men #529|529}} and {{cl|Generation Hope #1}}-{{cl|Generation Hope #4|4}} , and they became an officially sanctioned X-Team with [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]]' permission in {{cl|Generation Hope #5}}.\n\n* Many of The Lights come from the same geographic regions or nations as the ''All New, All Different'' [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] team:\n**[[Hope Summers
