Some time in the middle ages, one of the members [[Ebrok (Earth-616)|Ebrok]] magically evolved [[cats]] into the [[Cat People (Demons)|Cat People]]. When [[Orann (Earth-616)|Orann]] and the Guild  learned what he had done they was disgusted by his actions and banished his creation to [[Land Within|another realm]]. Ebrok's original two creations, [[Flavius (Earth-616)|Flavius]] and [[Helene (Earth-616)|Helene]] escaped the purge by devising a magical glamour to hide as humans. When Orann found out he killed Ebrok. He tried to take them out but the retaliated by throwing a potion at him, which sends him fleeing out into town where he inadvertently spreads a new disease the \"[[Black Plague (Event)|Black Plague]]\".{{r|What If? Vol 1 35}}\n\nHelene and Flavius escaped into the country side but was being tracked by the Guild. They summoned the [[Balkatar]] as a protector but he fell under the Guilds control. They then tried to uplift another cat but the Guild had made that spell impossible. They then used their magic to turn a human into a Cat Person. They called their new creation [[Tigra (Original) (Earth-616)|Tigra]], she was a great warrior who destroyed the Guild with ease.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 6}}\u2003\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]"
