However, to Warren's disappointment, Alpha's clones didn't have any of his powers as the accident that gave them to him did not alter his DNA. Seeing that would lead them to nowhere, one of the Jackal clones pressed a red button that destroyed all the clones present, including himself.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 692|693}}\n\n===Sibling Rivalry===\nOne of Miles' clones assisted him in the creation of the [[Mutant-Powered Spider-Clones (Earth-616)|Mutant-Powered Spider-Clones]] and in the capture of both [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]].{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 1|2}} The clone was eventually killed by the Scarlet Spider.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 20}}\n\n===[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]===\nA new batch of Miles Warren clones was created by [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Ben Reilly]] to trick the real one into thinking he was a clone as punishment for using him to find a cure for the cellular degradation caused by his new cloning procedure. They were convinced to work for Reilly as payment for [[New U Pills|the pills]] he devised to keep their cellular degeneration at bay. With their assistance, Reilly built [[New U Technologies (Earth-616)|New U Technologies]] in hopes of using their cloning technology for good.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 22}}\n\nAll of them died due to a signal set off by Reilly to destabilize the bodies of New U's clones worldwide, and cause a [[Carrion Virus]] outbreak with the intention of bringing every single person back as a clone once they had died.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 24}}\n\n==Weaknesses==\n'''Pill Dependence:''' In order to prevent their bodies from breaking down due to the cellular degradation caused by a flaw in [[Miles Warren (Earth-616)|Miles Warren]]'s new cloning process, the New U batch of clones had to ingest daily [[New U Pills|a pill]] provided by [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Ben Reilly]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 22}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Clones]]\n[[Category:Clones of Miles Warren]]\n[[Category:Clones Created by Miles Warren]]\n[[Category:Clones Created By Ben Reilly]]\n[[Category:Cellular Degeneration]]"
