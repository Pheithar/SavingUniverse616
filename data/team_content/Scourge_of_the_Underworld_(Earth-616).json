With funding from  [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]], he trained numerous volunteers to go around the world and kill various criminals. However, his actions were discovered by [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|U.S.Agent]], who killed his most recent operatives and arrested him for assisting numerous murders.{{r|U.S.Agent Vol 1 2|4}} Following the organization's end, [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Gyrich]] was manipulated into brainwashing two heroes, [[Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616)|Demolition Man]] and [[Jack Monroe (Earth-616)|Nomad]] into becoming the next Scourges, but this was also quickly shut down. Ironically, [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|U.S.Agent]] eventually grew tired of the crime himself, and restarted the program after [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Wilson Fisk]] became mayor of [[New York City|New York]].{{r|Captain America Vol 9 18}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/scourgeundrwrld.htm Scourge of the Underworld at Marvel Appendix]\n}}"
