[[Anya Corazon (Earth-616)|Ara\u00f1a]] and [[Rebecca Barnes (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Nomad]] teamed up with [[Benito Serrano (Earth-616)|El Toro]], also teaching him that fatal violence is unacceptable.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Greg Willis (Earth-616)|Gravity]] and [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Firestar]] learned from [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]] that it was almost historically impossible that [[Danielle Blunt (Earth-616)|Aftershock]] was his daughter.\n\nThe confrontation between the Young Allies and the Bastards of Evil came to a head in a battle between the entirety of both teams, and the Bastards hidden leader, [[Superior (Bastards of Evil) (Earth-616)|the Superior]], revealing himself.\n\nThe Allies eventually defeated the Superior, thanks in part to certain members of the Bastards turning on him after the true nature of their powers were revealed.\n\nIn the end, Nomad began to suggest that the team formally unite under the banner of Young Alllies. Surprisingly, almost all the other Allies rejected this idea, and Toro may have not only because he didn't understand what she was saying.\n\nIt remains to be seen if the Allies shall remain an unofficial team, merely assisting each other in other capacities, or if they will eventually unite as a single force.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Heroic Age (Event)]]"
