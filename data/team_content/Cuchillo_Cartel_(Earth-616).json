The corporation bought land from the cartel, and gave them a drug that turns humans into superhumans as payment. The cartel also guarded the facility that Roxxon built on that land. Which was extracting and refining a rare energy source into weapons-grade material.{{r|Young Allies Vol 2 1}}{{r|Onslaught Unleashed Vol 1 2}}\n\nThe cartel built itself an army of child soldiers. Pre-adolescent boys who were taken from their families and had their villages burned. They were given paramilitary training and brainwashed, turning them into young killers. With the drug that Roxxon provided they experimented on at least two of their child soldiers, who were turned into super powered mutates.{{r|Young Allies Vol 2 1}}\n\nFourteen years later, Cuchillo the head of the cartel and a number of Roxxon employees were slaughtered by [[Dragon (Marco) (Earth-616)|El Dragon]], one of the child soldiers that were turned into super soldiers. He took over the cartel and the facility, but it was a short-lived reign. While the [[Young Allies (Modern) (Earth-616)|Young Allies]] and [[Secret Avengers (Black Ops Unit) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] battled the psychic entity [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]] which was the source of that energy and was trying to return from the [[Negative Zone]], El Dragon battled his former friend and fellow child soldier [[Benito Serrano (Earth-616)|Toro]]. El Dragon lost the fight and his powers.{{r|Onslaught Unleashed Vol 1 2|4}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Colombian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Cartels]]"
