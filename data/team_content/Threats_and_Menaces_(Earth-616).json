Jonah Jameson]] after his time on his radio talk show, ''Get to Work!'' on [[Talk 616! (Earth-616)|Talk 616!]], was ruined due to scheduling alterations and subtle interference by [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Wilson Fisk]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 38}}\n\nThe site uses gossip and tags on the superhuman community to generate interest in their articles, and thus bring in their revenue. Their first major online trending article was by Jameson, who broke a story about [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] after the former tried explaining his public robbing from [[Pluto (Organization) (Earth-616)|Pluto]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 38}}\n\n===An Interview with Spider-Man===\nFollowing the heist expos\u00e9, Norah then convinced JJJ and Spider-Man to sit down for a podcast interview, hoping the two would fight for ratings.\n\n[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 39 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Spidey on JJJ's podcast for TNM]]\nAs an apology for ''blowing'' Spider-Man's cover with the bank heists, Norah Winters and Jonah successfully convinced Spider-man to sit down and do a podcast with Jonah to explain his side of the story. Despite a slow start, Jonah and Spidey came to a head when discussing the latter's ''hero'' career and his pranks on Jonah since his youth. As Norah celebrated the ratings from the clash of the two celebrities, they were interrupted midway into the podcast by Chance's surprising arrival to steal one of Spider-Man's web shooters. <!--{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 39|40}}-->\n\nWhen the criminal was successful with aid by the Jack O' Lanterns, and as there was no real public danger, Spider-Man stayed to finish the podcast, bringing incredible views on the site. Afterwards, Norah approached Peter Parker with a job offer, an idea beneficial for Spider-Man's public image, but was also an order from Chameleon; still communicating despite being locked up in a black site prison.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 39|40}}\n\n===Hot Topic===\nPeter Parker, desperate for income, accepts Norah's job offer and is shown Spider-Man's TNM employment suit, equipped with first person surveillance gear and private access only to Norah and Jonah. Although initially hesitant due to privacy issues, Peter accepts upon seeing the payout.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 61}}\n\n[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 63 Weaver Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|150px|TNM supplies Spidey's newest suit]]\nAs Spider-Man debuts the suit against a bank robbery with Hydro-Man, Shocker, and Speed Demon, Jonah calls directing Spider-Man on what to do based on viewer poll numbers. But after their capture, the trio reveal their name as the \"Boomerang Revenge Squad\" with their orders being to distract Spider-Man as an [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|assassin]] targets Gog and Fred.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 61}} Rating and viewership continued to climb as Spider-Man would stream each of his battles in the hunt for the Lifeline Tablet fragments.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 63}} With Spider-Man arriving in time to aid the [[Syndicate (Beetle) (Earth-616)|Syndicate]]'s fight with henchmen of Madame Masque and Crime Master, their combined victory is saved to the TNM stream- including Robbie's involvement in his son's rescue.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 64|65}} When Spider-Man was about to claim the last tablet fragment with an audience witnessing on livestream, Spider-Man cut the feed to claim the fragment. Afterwards, Spider-Man and Peter Parker both formally quit the organization- much to Jonah's chagrin and zealous crusade to \"prove\" Spider-Man a hero.{{r|Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: King's Ransom Vol 1 1}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 66}}\n\n===Expansion and New Stakes===\nDue to TNM's success in New York, another branch opened in [[Los Angeles]], where [[Olivia Obtera (Earth-616)|Olivia Obtera]] and [[Liam Cameron (Earth-616)|Liam Cameron]] investigated the past of [[Jeffrey McKracken (Earth-616)|Jeffrey McKracken]].{{r|Ghost Rider: Kushala Infinity Comic Vol 1 1}}\n\nMeanwhile in New York,  [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Cindy Moon]] (secretly the superhero Silk) also joined the website and reunited with Jonah to handle local coverage. However, Cindy unintentionally brought criminal attention on Jonah, forcing the two to work together to uncover the mastermind.{{r|Silk Vol 3 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = TNM employees carry various technologies to be on alert for news stories.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 38}}\n* Laptops: Each employee has a laptop to continue their work anywhere.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 38}}\n* Cell Phones: Every employee has a cell phone for communication.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 38}}\n* Spider-Man's TNM Suit: prototype-suit equipped with 360\u02dasurveillance tech to record POV action, upgraded Web-Shooters, and augmented Spider-Sense compatibility.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 61}}\n* Jonah's Overwatch station: computer station for monitoring and communicating with Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 61}}\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The name \"Threats and Menaces\" is a reference to [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|JJJ]]'s former strapline, ''\"Spider-Man: Threat or Menace?\"''\n* The company also shares the name of Jonah's personal podcast from before he started championing Spider-Man's heroism.{{r|Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 6}}\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:News Networks]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]"
