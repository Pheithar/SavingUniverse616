He escaped with the help of a friendly ant and restored himself to his normal size.{{r|Tales to Astonish #27}} The incident triggered an interest in ants in Pym, and he theorized that ants communicate through psionic/pheromonal/electrical waves transmitted through their antennae. After months of work, Pym succeeded in creating his first \"[[Ant-Man's Helmet|cybernetic helmet]]\", which would enable him to communicate with ants through transmitting and receiving psionic/pheromonal/electrical waves. Through this helmet, he managed to control a number of ants who would help him in his adventures as [[Ant-Man]].{{r|Tales to Astonish #35}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Ants]]\n[[Category:Pym Particles]]\n[[Category:Size Alteration]]\n[[Category:Pets]]"
