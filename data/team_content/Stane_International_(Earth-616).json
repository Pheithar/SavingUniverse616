Founded in the 19th Century by [[Isaac Stark (Earth-616)|Isaac Stark, Sr.]] and later carried into the [[Glossary:Modern Age|Modern Age]] by members of the Stark family,{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 10}} the company was later subjected to a hostile takeover operated by corporate raider [[Obadiah Stane (Earth-616)|Obadiah Stane]] under [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]'s chairmanship and then renamed Stane International.{{r|Iron Man #173}} After Obadiah Stane's death,{{r|Iron Man #200}} the company was first controlled by the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Executive Board (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D. Executive Board]] through a [[Life-Model Decoy]] of [[Obadiah Stane (LMD) (Earth-616)|Obadiah Stane]],{{r|Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. #3}} and later acquired by [[Justin Hammer (Earth-616)|Justin Hammer]]'s [[Hammer Industries (Earth-616)|Hammer Industries]], being finally reabsorbed back by Tony Stark through his new business entity, [[Stark Enterprises (Earth-616)|Stark Enterprises]].{{r|Iron Man #283}} Stark then ended up shutting down Stane International due to the company's previous illegal activities under Hammer Industries' ownership.{{r|Iron Man #301}}\n| History                 = \n===19th Century===\nThe company's origins date back to the 19th Century, when [[Isaac Stark, Sr. (Earth-616)|Dr. Isaac Stark Sr.]] turned his manufacturing and engineering concern into a global industrial superpower, developing new technologies that helped to redefine innovative security measures for the industrial age.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 5}} After Isaac Stark's death, the company passed through several hands, including his son [[Isaac Stark, Jr. (Earth-616)|Isaac Stark, Jr.]] and grandson [[Howard Stark, Sr. (Earth-616)|Howard Stark, Sr.]]{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 10}}{{r|All-New Iron Manual #1}}\n\n===20th Century===\nStark Industries gained growing prosperity under the leadership of Howard Stark Senior's son, [[Howard Stark (Earth-616)|Howard Stark, Jr.]],{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 5}} who had obtained full control of the company after his brother, [[Edward Stark (Earth-616)|Edward]], had sold his shares.{{r|All-New Iron Manual #1}} Appointed President of Stark Industries,{{r|Iron Man: The Iron Age #1}} Howard Stark successfully turned the company into the world leader in munitions development, while also branching out into several other scientific fields, including aeronautics, robotics, micro-technology and fringe science; since that, Stark Industries had its [[Stark Enterprises Main Plant|corporate offices]] in the portion of [[New York City]]'s [[Queens]] province located in [[Long Island]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 5}}\n\n[[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] was an initial investors in Stark Industries. The original investment was $100,000, but now when the size of the investment was calculated, a second line of zeroes was required.{{r|Hercules: Fall of an Avenger #1}}\n\nIn early 1960s,{{r|Secret Warriors #1|'s S.H.I.E.L.D. History log}} Howard Stark helped founding a global espionage agency named [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], with Stark Industries providing weapons, munitions, technology and vehicles, including the agency's mobile headquarters, known as the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]].{{r|Original Sin Annual #1}}\n\nHoward relied upon the genius of his adopted son, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Anthony]], for many of the company's advancements, even appointing him Vice President of Development. Tony, however, demonstrated little interest in Stark Industries' day-to-day management, and industrial rival [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Republic Oil & Gas Company]], in order to have Tony selling them his shares, arranged for the death of Howard and [[Maria Stark (Earth-616)|Maria Stark]] in a car accident. Tony, sole heir to his father's assets, was promoted to President, taking full control of Stark Industries and refusing Republic Oil's selling offer.{{r|Iron Man: The Iron Age #1|2}}\n\n===[[Glossary:Modern Age|Modern Age]]===\n[[File:Stark Industries (Earth-616) from Tales of Suspense Vol 1 48 001.jpg|thumb|left]]\nTony Stark then continued to aggressively develop new technologies and innovations, leading Stark Industries to become a major contractor for both corporate and [[United States Government (Earth-616)|government]] concerns. While personally overseeing the using of his manufactured munitions and weapons by the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Army]] in the Middle East,{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 1|6}} Tony Stark was nearly killed by an exploding land mine; captured by some revolutionary terrorists, he was saved by scientist [[Ho Yinsen (Earth-616)|Ho Yinsen]], a fellow prisoner. Stark then developed a [[Iron Man Armor Model 1|suit]] of sturdy body armor that not only saved his injured heart, but also enabled him to escape imprisonment. Upon returning to the [[United States of America|United States]], Tony modified the crude battlesuit, ultimately building what would soon become the recognizable [[Iron Man Armor|armor of Iron Man]].{{r|Tales of Suspense #39}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 1|6}}\n\nBack in the United States, Tony proudly kept Stark Industries running, employing [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Virginia 'Pepper' Potts]] as his personal Executive Assistant and ex-boxer [[Harold Hogan (Earth-616)|Harold 'Happy' Hogan]] as chauffeur. Requiring the Iron Man Armor's chest plate (actually an [[Arc Reactor]]) to being kept alive, Stark introduced ''Iron Man'' as its bodyguard, starting to fund and finance the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]' activities (a superheroes group which he, as Iron Man, had founded), even setting his family's [[Manhattan]] manor as the Avengers' headquarters, known as the [[Avengers Mansion]].{{r|Iron Man: The Iron Age #1|2}} Stark also maintained his father's contract with S.H.I.E.L.D., producing equipment, weapons and vehicles for the organization, eventually becoming part of its [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Executive Board (Earth-616)|Supreme International Council]] as Head of Special Weapons Division.{{r|Strange Tales #135}}{{r|Iron Man: The Iron Age #2}}\n\nUnder Tony Stark's leadership, Stark Industries had several lucrative contracts with many financial institutions, but, despite his skill as an inventor and businessman, Stark's playboy image didn't sit well with many military and political figures, including [[United States Senate (Earth-616)|senator]] [[Harrington Byrd (Earth-616)|Harrington Byrd]], who frequently clashed with Tony over how he ran Stark Industries and performed under government contracts.{{r|Tales of Suspense #46|47}}\n\n====Stark International====\nAfter driving the company to new heights year after year, Tony Stark eventually suffered a crisis of conscience and declared that Stark would no longer produce weapons for S.H.I.E.L.D., the [[United States Government (Earth-616)|Government]], or any other parties.{{r|Iron Man #50|51}} As Stark Industries continued to change its public persona and strengthened the corporation's foreign interests, it became known as Stark International.{{r|Iron Man #73}}\n\n====Stane International====\nAs part of his ongoing efforts to destroy Tony Stark, corporate raider [[Obadiah Stane (Earth-616)|Obadiah Stane]] brought Stark International to the edge of financial ruin. On top of the physical and psychological torments heaped upon him, Tony was eventually bought out by Stane, and Stark International was renamed in favor of its new owner.{{r|Iron Man #173}}\n\nAfter Obadiah Stane's downfall and death,{{r|Iron Man #200}} the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Executive Board (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D. Executive Board]] ended up controlling the company through an [[Obadiah Stane (LMD) (Earth-616)|advanced]] [[Life-Model Decoy]] of Stane.{{r|Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. #3}} The company was then acquired by Tony Stark's rival [[Justin Hammer (Earth-616)|Justin Hammer]]'s [[Hammer Industries (Earth-616)|Hammer Industries]], and later reabsorbed back by Tony Stark's latest corporate entity, [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Stark Industries]], after Tony forced Justin Hammer to turn the assets back over to him. Stane International then became a subsidiary of Stark Enterprises.{{r|Iron Man #283}}\n\nStark Enterprises later shut down Stane International due to its previous illegal activities performed while under Justin Hammer's ownership.{{r|Iron Man #301}}\n\n==Executive Staff==\n===Stark Industries===\n* [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Anthony 'Tony' Stark]] -
