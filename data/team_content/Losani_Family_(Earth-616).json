Their drug supplier was the [[Black Knife Cartel (Earth-616)|Black Knife Cartel]] who wanted to setup their operation in [[New York City]], cutting out the middlemen (the Losani Family). \n\n[[Raph Losani (Earth-616)|Raph Losani]] declined but his son [[Fabian Losani (Earth-616)|Fabian]] went to [[Colombia]] to negotiate. He paid [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]] to rescue his son who he believed had been taken hostage by the Black Knife cartel. In reality his son betrayed him and had made his own deal with the cartel. Where they would eliminate his father and then the cartel would setup operations in New York, and expand their activities in the United States. Fabian expected to make far more money than the family did before.\n\nAfter Bullseye brought back Fabian and got paid, he revealed to Raph what his son had done. Raph was going to have his men kill his son, but Bullseye killed Raph and the men in the room. Leaving only his son alive and informed him the family was now his. When asked why he did it, Bullseye said because he felt like it. He knew Fabian was not ready to lead the family, and would last a week at most, probably not even the night. Bullseye did it for entertainment purposes, to see the carnage that would come.{{r|Bullseye Vol 1 1|5}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Crime Families]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Cosa Nostra]]\n[[Category:Italian Organizations]]"
