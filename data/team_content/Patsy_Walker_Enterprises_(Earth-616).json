However, [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Patsy]] actually hated the notoriety the series brought on.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 89}}{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 59}}\n\n[[File:Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!

Hedy renamed the company '''Patsy-Hedy Entertainment''' and began republishing the classic Patsy Walker comics.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 2 2000}}{{r|Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat!
