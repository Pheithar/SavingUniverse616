At some point, the three left to form their own team known as the Next Wave and establish a reputation as freelance mercenaries, willing to work for anyone who pays them handsomely. \n\nIn presumably their first outing, the Next Wave attacked the estate of their former employee Penner but was stopped by the vigilante Ghost Rider and the mutants Wolverine and the Beast. After experiencing the Ghost Rider's \"[[Glossary:Penance Stare|penance stare]]\" the team seemed incapacitated.\n\n[[Sandman]] who had just left the [[Wild Pack]] and the mysterious [[Fin]] joined the team, just as they were hired by [[Hydra]] to destroy Cyberwarriors that had been stolen by the splinter group The [[Genesis Coalition]]. They infiltrated the aquatic battle station at the same time as [[Silver Sable]]'s [[Wild Pack]] and proceeded with the mission, accidentally destroying the battle station with there reckless tactics and nearly drowning the [[Wild Pack]]. After the battle was won [[Agent X]] suggested they should work together sometime and would lease their services to Silver Sable who bluntly replied they didn't meet her standards. [[Sandman]] realized his place was with the Wild Pack and [[Silver Sable]] welcomed him back. [[Fin]] also left the team and Joined [[Sandman]] in Silver Sable's newly formed team The [[Intruders]].\n\nLater, the Next Wave found themselves hunted by a team called the Posse\u2014another super-powered trio hired by Penner to exact revenge on the Next Wave. The ensuing battle attracted the attention of Ghost Rider and Wolverine, who easily defeated both the Next Wave and the Posse. Ghost Rider then turned his penance stare on the Next Wave once more. \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://members.fortunecity.com/jsc2593/nextwave.html\n* Unofficial Handbook of the Marvel Universe\n}}"
