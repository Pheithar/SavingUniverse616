Word spread across the galaxy of his generosity and the spoils that those who were loyal to him shared in. Based at its stronghold in the [[Black Quadrant]], the Black Order grew and every day new territories came under its control. Corvus' organization worked like a well-oiled machine, with control being the pillars that held up his kingdom.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 1}}\n\nCorvus Glaive's Black Order seemingly swore fealty to Thanos after he reclaimed the Black Quadrant by killing their leader. They accompanied the Mad Titan to [[Gilgrath]], where he killed his father [[A'Lars (Earth-616)|A'Lars]],{{r|Thanos Vol 2 1|2}} before coming to an end at the hands of [[Thane (Earth-616)|Thane]], then host of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]].{{r|Thanos Vol 2 6}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Alien Military Forces]]\n[[Category:Interstellar Fleets]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]"
