Helicarrier|S.H.I.E.L.D. Archangel Helicarrier]]. Rhodes normally didn't operate more than ten units, as doing so induced him headaches and nosebleed.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 39}}\n\n[[File:War Machine Drones (Earth-616) from Avengers Vol 5 35 001.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe War Machine Drones were dispatched alongside the [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] after [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] member [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus Cho]] broke into [[Stark Tower|S.H.I.E.L.D. Station: Golgotha]] to steal all of [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]'s computer files. Cho was able to escape from one drone by disrupting the A.I.'s communication system which caused it to shut down and slave to a secondary source. \n\nIn doing so the drone started to attack [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], but Danvers was able to quickly destroy it. The rest of the drones succeeded in cornering Cho so he could be captured by the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]], who  interrogated him on the whereabouts of the rest of the Illuminati.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}}\n\nThe War Machine Drones were deployed later when the Illuminati were found in [[Spain]]. However, most of the suits were destroyed by the clandestine group of heroes.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}}\n\n| Equipment               = Multiple [[War Machine Armor Model 8|War Machine Armor]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each armor's arsenal\n\n| Notes                   = * The [[War Machine Armor Model 8|War Machine Armor]] used for the drones is adapted from the [[War Machine Armor MK II (Earth-199999)|War Machine Armor MK II]] of the [[Earth-199999|Marvel Cinematic Universe]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D.
