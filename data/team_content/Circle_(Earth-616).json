During an auction run by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]], the Circle bought part of the replicated [[Extremis virus|Extremis technology]], creating new and better [[Knight-Suit|exoskeletons]] for their own purposes.\n\nAfter they noticed [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] was in the search of the Extremis which A.I.M. stole, Arthur proposed Stark a wager: if Stark defeated the Circle's Extremis-enhanced pilots, he would be free to retrieve the Extremis. During the battle, Stark noticed a that the Circle's force field which protected their sample of Extremis was light-permeable, being able to destroy their Extremis using a potent U.V. laser causing the loss of all the Extremis they had left and rendering them unable to continue producing new technologies of their own.{{r|Iron Man Vol 5 2}}\n\nWhen the powerful material [[Phlogistone]] was found in the Moon, the Circle was sent to [[Tranquility Gulch]], the human colony from which the Phlogistone was studied, as representatives of Symkaria.{{r|Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic Vol 1 4}} They later helped [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] attack the embassy of the country of their common enemy, Doctor Doom, in an attempt to prevent any Phlogistone from reaching Doom's hands.{{r|Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic Vol 1 8}} During the battle, [[Wayne Dubrovnic (Earth-616)|Gawain]] died, but the Doombot army was destroyed and the Latverian presence in the Moon removed.{{r|Iron Man: Fatal Frontier Infinite Comic Vol 1 10}}\n\nThe Circle ended up in [[Aniana]] to arrest members of [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] for the theft of stolen goods but instead they ended up in a battle against [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]] and [[Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse)|Shatterstar]] when the two refused.{{r|X-Force Vol 5 7}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Knight-Suit|Knight-Suits]], Anti-Repulsor tech force fields; formerly Extremis Virus.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Armor Users]]\n[[Category:Symkarian Organizations]]"
