They were specifically assembled because of their lack of intelligence, as the infection worked its way down from the most mentally advanced people to the bottom.\n\nThe Howling Commandos secured the beacon into the [[Dark Dimension]] from infected people while S.H.I.E.L.D. agents confronted [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]]. When the ruler of the Dark Dimension was finally defeated, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents returned to Earth through a portal, the backlash caused the Commandos to be sucked into the Dark Dimension, from where Coulson planned to retrieve them as soon as possible.{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D.
