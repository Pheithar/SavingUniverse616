They had his slave bribed with [[Vanirgeld]] for him to use arsenic on Vadis and his family. Those deaths were attributed to a curse cast by the [[Witch-Queen of the Rus Vanir (Earth-616)|Witch-Queen of the Rus Vanir]].<!-- {{r|Conan the Savage #1|; Hounds to the Slaughter}} -->\n\nVadis was replaced by [[Lucius Vindictus (Earth-616)|Lucius Vindictus]]. That very night, Vanir managed to infiltrate the fort, but [[Conan (Earth-616)|Conan]] the [[Cimmeria]]n, mercenary for the fort but chained outside, managed to kill a few, and the the attack was repelled by the Aquilonians. In the ensuing days, Conan helped them fight off the Vanir, first by denouncing the slave's treachery, then by using a [[Hyrkanian Bow|bow]] he took from an [[Hyrkania]]n chieftain to slay the Witch-Queen, using a [[Rosetree]] shaft (a wood sacred to the Vanir). The next day, the Vanir used a ram mounted on skis to breach the fort, and slaughtered everyone in it save for Conan and Lucius Vindictus who managed to escape.{{r|Conan the Savage #1|; Hounds to the Slaughter}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Ram mounted on skis.{{r|Conan the Savage #1|; Hounds to the Slaughter}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Vanir (Nordheimr)]]"
