Using the [[External Gate]], [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] led a group of [[Homo superior|mutants]] to Otherworld where they were almost immediately ambushed by First Horsemen of Apocalypse and [[Summoner (Arakko) (Earth-616)|Summoner]]. To end the fighting, [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Omniversal Majestrix Opal Luna Saturnyne]] offered the Horsemen and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] the opportunity to enter a [[X of Swords|tournament of champions]]. With no alternatives, both sides accepted the offer and Saturnyne magically implanted the tournament weapons and champions into the minds of [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] and [[Pestilence (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|Pestilence]].{{r|X of Swords: Creation Vol 1 1}}\n\nSummoner, [[Annihilation (Earth-616)|Annihilation]] and [[War (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|War]] were among the chosen who already possessed their swords. With only three days prepare for battle, Annihilation commanded the Horsemen and [[Summoner (Arakko) (Earth-616)|Summoner]] to set about recruiting the other swordbearers and retrieving their swords. Summoner recruited [[Redroot (Earth-616)|Redroot]] by promising the tournament would end with the re-unification of Arakkoa and Krakoa, and recruited [[Bei (Earth-616)|Bei the Bloodmoon]] with the promise of battle. [[War (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|War]] and Pestilence travelled to [[Tower of Broken Will|The Tower of Broken Will]] to release [[Solem (Earth-616)|Solem]], the slayer of War's husband. After being freed, Solem travelled to [[Hell]] and enlisted the aid of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] to obtain the [[Muramasa Blade]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 6}}{{r|X-Force Vol 6 13}} They also bought the services of the mercenary [[Pogg Ur-Pogg (Earth-616)|Pogg Ur-Pogg]] and recruited their aunt [[Isca (Earth-616)|Isca the Unbeaten]]. [[Death (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|Death]] and [[Famine (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|Famine]] recruited [[White Sword (Earth-616)|the White Sword]] with the promise to grant him any request of his choosing upon their victory, and retrieved Death's sword; [[Black Bone of Amduat|the Black Bone of Amduat]] from an [[Amenth|Amrnthi]] temple. With their champions recruited and their weapons gathered, the swordbearers travelled to Otherworld to partake in the tournament.{{r|X of Swords: Stasis Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe Swordbearers of Arakko quickly managed to gain the upper hand against their Krakoan foes. Despite losing two of their champions; [[Death (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|Death]] and [[Redroot (Earth-616)|Redroot]] during the course of the tournament, they took a commanding lead with the score at 18-6 ahead of the penultimate challenge; a duel between the White Sword and the Krakoan champion [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]]. The White Sword chose to summon his soldiers to face Gorgon before personally taking him on. Gorgon managed to slay 13 of the White Sword's champions when Saturnyne announced that Krakoa had receieved a point for each slain champion, giving them a one-point lead. Only when War begged him to end it, did the White Sword personally kill Gorgon, evening the score.{{r|Cable Vol 4 6}}\n\nThe final challenge was to be a duel between the Annihilation-controlled [[Genesis (Earth-616)|Genesis]] and her erstwhile husband [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]]. When Apocalypse gained the upper hand, Annihilation seized control of its host and summoned the armies of Amenth. {{r|X-Men Vol 5 15}} As chaos ensued, the swordbearers of Arakko were split on what to do. White Sword chose to depart the battlefield, stating he had come for a fight not a battle, and had won it. [[Bei (Earth-616)|Bei]], who had been wed to Krakoan swordbearer [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]] during one of the challenges chose to defect to her husband's side. The rest of the swordbearers, lead by [[Isca (Earth-616)|Isca]] pursued the Krakoans and participated in the ensuing battle. {{r|Excalibur Vol 4 15}} \n\nWhile the Arakki and Amenthian forces seemed to have the upper hand, the intervention of the newly reformed [[Captain Britain Corps (Multiverse)|Captain Britain Corps]], the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and the [[Vescora]] began to turn the tide in favor of the Krakoans. The battle was ended when Apocalypse managed to defeat Annihilation, seize control of it, and cede the tournament on its behalf, ending the conflict. {{r|X of Swords: Destruction Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = <br>\n* [[Muramasa Blade]]{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 6}}{{r|X-Force Vol 6 13}}\n* [[Twilight Sword (Amenth)|The Twilight Sword]]{{r|X of Swords: Creation Vol 1 1}}\n* [[Mercy (Sword)|Mercy]]\n* [[Vermilion|Vermilion, the Red Sword of War]]\n* [[Colony (Sword)|Colony]]\n* [[Black Bone of Amduat|The Black Bone of Amduat]]\n* [[Seducer]]\n* [[Pogg Ur-Pogg (Sword)|Pogg Ur-Pogg]]\n* [[Purity (Sword)|Purity]]\n* [[Alluvium]]\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:X of Swords]]"
