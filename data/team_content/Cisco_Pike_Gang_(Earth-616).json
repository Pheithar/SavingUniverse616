They came to the town of Wells Junction and took over the saloon. When the sheriff, Matt Morgan, tried to stop them, he was shot and his deputy killed. They then robbed the saloon, raped several women and left town that night. They planned to return to take over the town, however, and asked the [[Jonathan Clay (Earth-616)|Rawhide Kid]] to help them. The Kid refused and ended up becoming the sheriff's new deputy to ensure the safety of the town. This caused Pike to go out and round up a group of unusual criminals to add to his gang as insurance against the Rawhide Kid. These new members to the gang included: [[Catastrophe Jen (Earth-616)|Catastrophe Jen]], the Chinese brothers [[Yin (Earth-616)|Yin]] and [[Yang (Earth-616)|Yang]], the French masked swordsman known only as [[Gilles Follet (Earth-616)|Le' Sabre]] and the Native medicine man [[Thunderclaw (Earth-616)|Thunderclaw]].\n\nPike was unable to convince his second-in-command Red Duck not to go into town alone to have his revenge on the Kid, and once he left camp assumed he would be undoubtedly be killed and held a memorial service in his memory. When he later found out that Duck had in been locked up in jail by the Kid and not killed, he planned to break him out during their raid on the town.\n\nThe outlaws were very surprised to find the town completely deserted upon their arrival, as the Kid asked everyone to leave so they would not be in his way. The Kid went on to single-handedly dispatch Pike's entire gang and killing Pike himself with a Derringer. He made it appear, however, as if sheriff Morgan had taken down Pike in order to restore his son's pride in his old man.{{r|Rawhide Kid Vol 3 1|5}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Horses\n| Weapons                 = Pistols, rifles, shotguns, knives.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Western Characters]]"
