[[Lich (Earth-616)|Lich]], [[Butterfly (Avatars) (Earth-616)|Butterfly]], [[Deluge (Avatars) (Earth-616)|Deluge]], [[Foundry (Avatars) (Earth-616)|Foundry]] and [[Q'Wake (Earth-616)|Q'Wake]] attacked Hong Kong, and were defeated by [[Force Works (Earth-616)|Force Works]], and retreated. [[Warfist (Earth-616)|Warfist]], [[Ancestor (Earth-616)|Ancestor]] and [[Old Woman (Earth-616)|Old Woman]] watched while the Mandarin tortured [[Iron Man (Anthony \"Tony\" Stark)|Iron Man]] and [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]], and failed to stop [[Century (Alien) (Earth-616)|Century]]'s attack, forcing the Mandarin to intervene, seemingly killing War Machine and Century.{{r|Force Works #6}}\n\n[[Warfist (Earth-616)|Warfist]] and [[Ancestor (Earth-616)|Ancestor]] thrashed the helpless Iron Man until the Mandarin called them off. Force Works interrogated their captive, Lich.{{r|War Machine #9}}\n\nThe Avatars watched as the Mandarin continued to torture Iron Man, and created an enchanted mask to transform a peasant into the newest Avatar, [[Turmoil (Avatars) (Earth-616)|Turmoil]]. The Mandarin then sent them away, to unmask Iron Man alone.{{r|Iron Man #311}}\n\n[[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|US Agent]] and [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]] battled the Mandarin\u2019s armies, defeating Old Woman, [[Sickle (Avatars) (Earth-616)|Sickle]], Warfist and Ancestor, who Agent slammed through a wall, apparently killing him. [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] caused the [[Mandarin's Rings]] to all misfire at once, with the blast killing Warfist. The Mandarin led the Avatars in his attack on Hong Kong.{{r|Force Works #7}}\n\nAfter the Avatars conquered Hong Kong, the Mandarin proclaimed himself the last emperor of Cathay.{{r|War Machine #10}}\n\nThe Avatars then attacked the [[Stark Industries Far East Division]] to bring Iron Man before their leader. Tony infected Mandarin with a Techno-Organic Virus that rapidly aged him, and turned Deluge to dust with a touch. Mandarin and his Avatars then disappeared.{{r|Iron Man #312}}\n\nThe Avatars returned to fight in the name of the new Mandarin ([[Temugin (Earth-616)|Temugin]]; Mandarin's son) and attacked [[New York City]]. They fought the [[Heroes for Hire (Knight & Wing) (Earth-616)|Heroes for Hire]] and were defeated.{{r|Heroes for Hire Vol 2 #1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/avatrz.htm\n}}"
