They followed their master's philosophy of [[wikipedia:Social_Darwinism|Social Darwinism]] the \"Survival of the Fittest\". They traditionally took the titles of '''[[Horsemen of Death|Death]]''', '''[[Famine]]''', '''[[War]]''', and '''[[Pestilence]]'''. During their conversions Apocalypse usually augmented their powers and/or outfitted them with specially designed weapons and equipment using his advanced [[Celestials|Celestial]] technology.\n\n| HistoryText             = \n===Origin===\n\n[[File:Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616) from Powers of X Vol 1 4.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe First Horsemen were the sons and daughters of Apocalypse and [[Genesis (Earth-616)|Genesis]] from the ancient mutant land of [[Okkara (Earth-616)|Okkara]]. When the four children were born, their maternal aunt, [[Isca (Earth-616)|Isca the Unbeaten]] forged the [[Scarab (Sword)|Scarab]], a sword in four parts to celebrate their births.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 13}}\n\nWhen [[Okkara (Earth-616)|Okkara]] was split by a force wielding the [[Twilight Sword (Amenth)|Twilight Sword]], Apocalypse and his first horsemen fought the invaders. In the end, they were responsible for the sealing of the chasm. The horsemen were sealed on the other side of the chasm alongside their mother and [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]], to the sorrow of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]].{{r|Powers of X #4}}{{r|X-Men Vol 5 12}}\n\nAfter the Horsemen were trapped in the hellish dimension of [[Amenth]], their father built a pyramid, sectioned in four parts, to serve as a monument to their sacrifice, the [[Temple of the Horsemen]], which housed four memorial tombs for each of them. Inside each tomb, Apocalypse hid a part of the Scarab.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 13}} During his mourning moments, Apocalypse visited the Temple of the Horsemen to remember his children.{{r|Marvel Comics Vol 1 1000}}\n\n===3rd Century===\nIn 281, [[Decimus Furius (Earth-616)|Decimus Furius]] activated his powers in [[Rome (Italy)|Rome]] and was collected by Apocalypse and \"stored\" for later use as the War of his [[Final Horsemen]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #3}}\n\n===4th Century===\nIn 325, [[Sanjar Javeed (Earth-616)|Sanjar Javeed]] was collected by Apocalypse and \"stored\" for later use as the Death of his [[Final Horsemen]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #3}}\n\n[[File:Horsemen of Apocalypse (11th Century) (Earth-616) from Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 6 001.jpg|left|250px|thumb|11th century incarnation]]\n===11th Century===\nIn 1013, Apocalypse came to [[Scandinavia]] to kill on the counsel of [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Rama-Tut]] who informed him of beings and ancestors of people who would cause a threat to him in the future. He then sent his four [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Four Horsemen]] ([[Phantom Bats of the Twelve Minds (Earth-616)|Pestilence/Phantom Bats of the Twelve Minds]], [[War (11th Century) (Earth-616)|War]], Native-American [[Famine (11th Century) (Earth-616)|Famine]], and [[Death (11th Century) (Earth-616)|Death]]) to kill [[Folkbern Logan (Earth-616)|Folkbern Logan]], ancestor of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], but they were all destroyed by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers #6}}\n\n===15th Century===\nIn the fifteenth century, Apocalypse led yet another group of Horsemen and rode among them as well, leading an army of followers known as the '''[[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Riders of the Dark]]'''. This army was so strong and powerful that some were led to believe that they were just a myth to scare soldiers even before their first battle.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}\n\nIn 1459, in Romania, the [[War (15th Century) (Earth-616)|Horseman of War]] led the Riders of the Dark, and single-handedly defeated [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Vlad the Impaler]] and his army.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}\n\n===19th Century===\nIn 1833, [[Ichisumi (Earth-616)|Ichisumi]] first activated and was collected by Apocalypse and \"stored\" for later use as the Famine of his [[Final Horsemen]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #3}}\n\nIn 1863, [[Jeb Lee (Earth-616)|Jeb Lee]] activated and was collected as well by Apocalypse, \"stored\" for later use as the Pestilence of his [[Final Horsemen]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #3}}\n\n===20th and 21th Centuries===\n[[File:X-Factor Vol 1 19.jpg|left|180px|thumb|First modern incarnation]]\n====First modern incarnation====\nThe first modern Horseman recruited by Apocalypse was [[Plague (Earth-616)|Plague]], a member of the [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]], whom he recruited during the [[Mutant Massacre]] to fill the role of [[Pestilence]]. He then approached ex-soldier [[Abraham Kieros (Earth-616)|Abraham Kieros]] and granted him the position of War. [[Autumn Rolfson (Earth-616)|Autumn Rolfson]] was Apocalypse's third choice and was given the position of Famine. Apocalypse then saved the de-winged [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] from his sabotaged, exploding plane and chose him to be his fourth and final Horseman, Death.{{r|X-Factor #15}}\n\nThe Four Horsemen were forced to battle one another for leadership, and Death emerged victorious. In a battle against [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]], the Horsemen were nearly defeated until Death appeared, shocking his former comrades. [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]] went to Apocalypse and asked for a power boost so he could avenge his fellow Morlocks. Pestilence was slain in the battle and Archangel came back to his senses after assuming he killed his former comrade, [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]]. Apocalypse was forced to retreat with his remaining Horsemen and Caliban.{{r|X-Factor #24|26}}\n\nCaliban replaced Angel on the team and became Death. He captured [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] and took them to [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]]. The [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] tracked him down and defeated Caliban and Famine and then realized the Horsemen were under Mr. Sinister's orders. The X-Men were later defeated by Apocalypse. Caliban battled [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] for revenge of the [[Mutant Massacre]] and lost the battle.{{r|X-Factor #51|53}}\n\n[[File:Bruce Banner (Earth-616) from Incredible Hulk Vol 1 457 0001.jpg|left|thumb|210px|The Hulk as War]]\n====The Hulk====\nAfter a battle with the X-Men in their [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|mansion]], [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] was discovered by Apocalypse and became his second incarnation of War. Apocalypse set him against the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] to test his strength. Hulk was able to knock back Juggernaut with the huge celestial energy boost that Apocalypse had given him. He was also able to best the [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]], but came to his senses when he thought he had injured his friend, [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]].{{r|Incredible Hulk #456}}\n\n====Second incarnation====\nFor his second team of Horsemen, Apocalypse had [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] abducted, replacing him with a [[Skrull]] [[James Howlett (Skrull) (Earth-616)|impostor]]{{r|Uncanny X-Men #371}} to prevent his absence being noted, and pitched him in battle against Sabretooth. The winner of the battle, Wolverine, became his Horseman of Death.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 #145}} Wolverine as Death, battled the X-Men and killed the impostor Wolverine.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 2 #1|3}} Apocalypse then turned [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]] into his second Horseman, War. Caliban was once again chosen to be one of Apocalypse's Horsemen, this time becoming Pestilence. Pestilence and War fought [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] and captured [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]].{{r|Cable #73|74}} In a battle against the X-Men, Death was unmasked and revealed to be Wolverine.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #96}}\n\nIn Apocalypse's lair, Cable escaped and defeated Death in battle. Apocalypse then threatened to kill Caliban. Apocalypse captured [[Roderick Campbell (Earth-616)|Rory Campbell]] and turned him into his fourth Horseman, Famine. The Horsemen then started collecting \"[[Apocalypse: The Twelve|The Twelve]]\". When Death captured [[Mikhail Rasputin (Earth-616)|Mikhail Rasputin]] and failed to teleport out with him, he was chased into the [[Alley|Morlock Tunnels]] by the X-Men. He battled them and regained his memory, thanks to the efforts of [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]], [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]], [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]] and [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]]. The rest of the Horsemen were teleported to another dimension by Mikhail.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #97}}\n\n====Third incarnation====\nFollowing the [[Earth-58163|House of M]] and [[Decimation|M-Day]], Apocalypse resurrected, only to find himself in a world with its mutant population reduced to a tenth of what it had been, out of the millions who populated earth prior to his demise at Cable's hands. Bent on becoming the new messiah for mutantkind, Apocalypse assembled a new cadre of Horsemen, with the purpose of wiping out 90% of the baseline human population.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #182}}\n\nApocalypse's new Horsemen were [[Gazer (Earth-616)|Gazer]] as War, [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]] as Famine, [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] as Pestilence and [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]] as Death. Gazer was saved from death and forced to battle an archaeologist for the mantle of War, which he won with the aid of Apocalypse's majordomo and scribe, [[Ozymandias (Earth-616)|Ozymandias]]. Both Sunfire, who had lost his legs at the hands of [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]] and his powers to [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] and Polaris, an [[M-Day]] victim, were captured, and reluctantly altered into Famine and Pestilence, respectively. Gambit, however, submitted himself willingly to be transformed into Death, as he had come to believe Apocalypse could be helpful to the mutant cause though he would require to be watched. Sunfire was able to break free of Apocalypse's control with the help of [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], although he was weakened by the experience. Polaris was knocked out by Iceman in the final battle. She was abandoned, saved by [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], and was de-brainwashed by the X-Men. Gazer died defending Apocalypse, stabbed in the back by Ozymandias. Sunfire took Gambit somewhere at the conclusion of the final battle, only to be approached by Mister Sinister.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #183|187}}\n\n[[File:Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 2 0001.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Final Horsemen]]\n====Final Horsemen====\nThe Final Horsemen, the contingency plan that Apocalypse had prepared in case of an ultimate failure, emerged and aided [[Clan Akkaba (Earth-616)|Clan Akkaba]], [[Ozymandias (Earth-616)|Ozymandias]] and the new [[Celestial Ship (Clone) (Earth-616)|Ship]] in resurrecting their master.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #1}}\n\nThe Horsemen's first test was to protect a recently revived Apocalypse from [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #2}} The Horsemen failed however and their master was killed by [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #4}} They reappeared later in service to Apocalypse's newly risen successor, [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]], who chose [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] as Death.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #17}}\n\nWar and Famine were destroyed by the returned [[Apocalypse Twins]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 7}}\n\n[[File:Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616) from Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 9 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Horsemen of Death]]\n====Horsemen of Death====\nThe [[Apocalypse Twins (Earth-616)|Apocalypse Twins]], using a set of both Life Seeds and Death Seeds, brought back to life [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]], [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], [[Eric Williams (Earth-616)|Grim Reaper]] and [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]], in order for them to serve as their Four Horsemen of Death.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #9}}\n\nBy the conclusion of their campaign, the Apocalypse Twins were apparently deceased. Banshee was a captive of the Avengers, Sentry had disappeared into space, and Daken and Grim Reaper were left to their own whims.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #22}}\n\n====The First Horsemen Return====\nThe First Horsemen of Apocalypse planned their return and overthrow of Krakoa with their fellow Arakki mutants and [[Demons|Daemon]] army by waging war on their [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|father]] and the [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoan]] mutants living there. [[War (First Horsemen)|War]] sent in her [[Summoner (Arakko) (Earth-616)|son]] to trick her father and the other mutants living there into building the [[External Gate]], connecting Otherworld to Krakoa. When Apocalypse, and some mutants who volunteered to traverse the gate, decided to cross over to Otherworld to see the danger that Summoner had warned of, he was attacked and betrayed by him and the First [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]], being forced to retreat back to Krakoa to heal their wounds and prepare for war between the two group.{{r| X of Swords: Creation Vol 1 1}}\n\n\n==Succession line==\n* '''Famine''':\n** [[Famine (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|Famine (First Horsemen)]]\n** [[Famine (11th Century) (Earth-616)|Famine (11th Century)]]\n** [[Autumn Rolfson (Earth-616)|Autumn Rolfson]]\n** [[Roderick Campbell (Earth-616)|Rory Campbell]]\n** [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Shiro Yoshida]]\n** [[Jeb Lee (Earth-616)|Jeb Lee]]\n* '''War''':\n** [[War (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|War (First Horsemen)]] \n** [[War (11th Century) (Earth-616)|War (11th Century)]]\n** [[War (15th Century) (Earth-616)|War (15th Century)]]\n** [[Abraham Kieros (Earth-616)|Abraham Kieros]]\n** [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]]\n** [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Cal'syee Neramani]]\n** [[Gazer (Earth-616)|Gazer]]\n** [[Decimus Furius (Earth-616)|Decimus Furius]]\n* '''Pestilence''':\n** [[Pestilence (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|Pestilence (First Horsemen)]] \n** [[Phantom Bats of the Twelve Minds (Earth-616)|Pestilence (Phantom Bats of the Twelve Minds)]] (11th Century)\n** [[Plague (Earth-616)|Plague]]\n** [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]]\n** [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Lorna Dane]]\n** [[Ichisumi (Earth-616)|Ichisumi]]\n* '''Death''': \n** [[Death (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|Death (First Horsemen)]]\n** [[Death (11th Century) (Earth-616)|Death (11th Century)]]\n** [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Warren Worthington III]]\n** [[Caliban (Earth-616)|Caliban]]\n** [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]]\n** [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Remy LeBeau]]\n** [[Sanjar Javeed (Earth-616)|Sanjar Javeed]]\n** [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Betsy Braddock]]\n** '''Four Horsemen of Death''':\n*** [[Eric Williams (Earth-616)|Eric Williams]]\n*** [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Sean Cassidy]]\n*** [[Akihiro (Earth-616)|Daken]]\n*** [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Robert Reynolds]]\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = <br>\n* '''[[Horsemen's Steeds]]''': Organic{{r|Uncanny Avengers #6}} or mechanical steeds for Horsemen unable to fly on their own.\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The [[Death Seed]] is seen within the comics to be necessary in the creation of [[Horsemen of Death|Death]], in an interview [[Rick Remender]] states that seeds exist for the [[Pestilence]], [[Famine]], and [[War]] positions.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=45736 X-Position: Remender Unites \"Uncanny Avengers\"]</ref> With the existence of the [[Life Seed]] and the fact that the newly ascended [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)#Age of Archangel|Archangel]] was called the \"Master of the Seven Seeds\", two other seed types are unaccounted for.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 14}}\n* These Horsemen of Apocalypse should not be confused with [[Axi-Tun|Axi-Tun Four Horsemen]] who battled the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [[Horsemen of Salvation (Earth-616)|Horsemen of Salvation]]\n}}"
