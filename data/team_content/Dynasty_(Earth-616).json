Also, they apparently only work in his country.\n\nThe Chinese army decided to use jets to explode the Dam, so although they would lose it anyway, they could at least destroy the enemy. Then the Dynasty left the scene in a special aircraft.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 513}}\n\nWhen Tony Stark was kidnapped by the Mandarin and forced to create new weapons for him, the Dynasty was contacted by Tony's friends [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Pepper Potts]] and [[Bethany Cabe (Earth-616)|Bethany Cabe]] of [[Stark Industries (Earth-616)|Resilient]] for help to rescue Tony which they gladly accepted.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 525}} The cavalry arrived just in time when Iron Man was fighting Mandarin and his Titanomechs, which were destroyed by the efforts of the heroes.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 526}}\n\nThe Dynasty fought [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]]' forces during [[Infinity (Event)|his invasion]]. The Star and Soldier One died in battle. Following the loss of their leader, the Dynasty disbanded. The Weather Witch and Saber would be part of the [[Ascendants (Earth-616)|Ascendants]].{{r|Avengers World Vol 1 13}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = A jet\n| Weapons                 = Various Dynasty members' arsenal\n\n| Notes                   = The Dynasty appears to the be successors of the other Chinese superhero teams [[China Force (Earth-616)|China Force]] and [[People's Defense Force (China) (Earth-616)|People's Defense Force]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
