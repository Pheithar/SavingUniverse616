Their name was a reference to [[Tarnax IV]], the Skrull throneworld that was devoured by [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]].\n\nThe group assaulted [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Teddy Altman]] at a gay bar when [[Bel-Dann (Earth-616)|Bel-Dann]] and [[Raksor (Earth-616)|Raksor]] came there to convince him to become the emperor of the united empire of the [[Kree]] and Skrulls, calling the two agents heretics for thinking such a notion. [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|David Alleyne]] and [[Thomas Shepherd (Earth-616)|Tommy Shepherd]] assisted Bel-Dann and Raksor in fighting them, before the group surrendered after Teddy wielded the [[Excelsior (Star-Sword)|Excelsior]] in front of them.{{r|Lords of Empyre: Emperor Hulkling Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Skrull Organizations]]"
