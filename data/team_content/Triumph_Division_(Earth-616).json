At the public ceremony during which the members of the Triumph Division were commended, a group of monks broke the rope line and approached the superheroes. Being undercover suicide bombers genetically engineered by [[Ezekiel Stane (Earth-616)|Ezekiel Stane]], the monks held onto the members of the Triumph Division and charged up. [[Red Feather I (Earth-616)|Red Feather]] ordered [[Wishing Man I (Earth-616)|Wishing Man]] to make them disappear, but before he could act, the monks exploded, obliterating the entire square and leaving no survivors. As the director of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] attended the funerals for the members of the Triumph Division. Since all members of the team possessed secret identities, the services were only attended by their immediate families. [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] also attended the funeral of [[Anitun I (Triumph Division) (Earth-616)|Anitun]], since she had been the mortal host of a [[Diwatas|Diwata]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 2}} A few weeks later, the succeeding members of the Triumph Division settled in the Triumph Hall. They were visited by Iron Man to pay respects.{{r|invincible Iron Man Vol 2 4}}\n\nWhen Tony Stark became a prisoner of the [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]], his allies [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Pepper Potts]] and [[Bethany Cabe (Earth-616)|Bethany Cabe]] set up a meeting in international waters with the Triumph Division and the [[China|Chinese]] superhero team the [[Dynasty (Earth-616)|Dynasty]] and requested their aid to take part in a rogue rescue operation to retrieve Stark from [[Troy (Mandarin City)|Mandarin City]]. Both teams were glad to help since Tony Stark had been present for them.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 525}} The heroes arrived during the final battle between Iron Man and the Mandarin. While the Dynasty took down the Mandarin's armed forces, the Triumph Division engaged the [[Titanomech|Titanomechs]] until Iron Man used the [[Swarm (Resilient)|Swarm]] to destroy them.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 526}}\n\nSome time later, the Triumph Division prevented the [[Infinaut (Earth-616)|Macronaut]] from making a landfall in Quezon City.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 6}}\n\nAfter the defeat of [[Sindr (Earth-616)|Sindr, Queen of Cinders]], the Triumph Division was in [[Shanghai]] where they were being celebrated for their bravery of defending the Philippines and the rest of Southeast Asia during the [[War of the Realms]]. But [[Pearl Pangan (Earth-616)|Wave]] was removed from the group for leaving her post even though she was in an integral part of the victory.\n\nWave traveled 500 miles to a small island in the [[Philippines|Philippine Sea]] to drown her sorrows but was located by [[Lei Ling (Earth-616)|Aero]] who wanted to make sure that she was okay. After a long talk between the two about Pearl's past, Red Feather arrived and demanded that Wave return her armor and swords since they were the property of the Triumph Division.{{r|Aero Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Various Triumph Division members' arsenal\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
