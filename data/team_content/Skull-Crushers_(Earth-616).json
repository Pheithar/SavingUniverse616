She met with [[Richard Rory (Earth-616)|Richard Rory]] and revealed it had been Snake who had stolen the money and spent it on heroin. They chased the pair through the swamp and Snake nearly killed Richard except he was accidentally saved by [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]] who killed Snake by knocking him over the head with his own chain, which Man-Thing possessed due to it being stuck within his body from an earlier confrontation.{{r|Man-Thing #2}} The two remaining bikers, French and Darby, left thanking Richard for revealing the truth about Snake and as they were driving out of the Swamp were both shot dead by [[Ross G. Everbest (Earth-616)|Foolkiller]].{{r|Man-Thing #3}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Gangs]]"
