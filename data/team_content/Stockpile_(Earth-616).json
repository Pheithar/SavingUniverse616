The team tried to seize control of [[Hall of Armor|the Armory]]. Iron Man and [[War Machine]] stopped the Stockpile, destroying Brass and causing traumatic sensory feedback on Morgan. Fearing death, Morgan  linked with every suit currently stored in the armory and used them to destroy Iron Man, as War Machine was occupied getting Sunstreak and Joust to medical treatment, giving Unicorn time to escape.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 330}}\n\nWhen Morgan was about to kill Iron Man, he choose to unmask him, revealing the [[Anthony Stark (Earth-96020)|younger Tony]] that the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] had only recently retrieved from an earlier [[Earth-96020|alternate timeline]]. This gave Tony enough time to override the link to the suits, setting them to self-destruct. Morgan died at the [[Helicon]] facility.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 331}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
