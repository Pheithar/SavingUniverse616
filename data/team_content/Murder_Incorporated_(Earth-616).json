Each homeless man admitted to the shelter was made to sign a life insurance policy taken out in their name. Murder, Inc then arranged for fatal \"accidents\" to occur, allowing the mission to claim the insurance and make large sums of money.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics Vol 1 60}}\n\nWhen members of Murder, Inc. attempted to kill a homeless man with a hit-and-run, [[Madeline Joyce (Earth-616)|Madeline Joyce]] witnessed the attack and changed into Miss America to foil the attempt and capture the driver. Forcing him to reveal the secret of his employers' operation, Miss America arrived at the community mission just in time to prevent another murder. However, she was clubbed over the head and tossed into the East River to drown. Breaking free, Miss America flew back to the mission and rounded up the members of Murder, Inc, and turned them all over to the authorities.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics Vol 1 60}}\n\nThe fate of the group members is unknown{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics Vol 1 60}} but, in recent times, [[Silvija Sablinova (Earth-616)|Silver Sablinova]] considered (and discarded) a mercenary job opposing Murder, Inc.,{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack Vol 1 1}} suggesting that the organization was still active as of 1992.<ref name=\"top\">This date is [[Glossary:Topical Reference|topical]].</ref>\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = The [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and [[Thomas Raymond (Earth-616)|Toro]] also fought Murder,Inc.<ref>{{cl|Young Men Vol 1 24}} (12/53) page 5 panel 2</ref> in the 1940s and the [[Albert Malik (Earth-616)|Communist Red Skull]] mentioned Murder,Inc.<ref>{{cl|Young Men Vol 1 24}} (12/53) page 2 panel 3 of the Captain America story</ref>\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Companies]]"
