They sought asylum in America, but the political situation in Genosha had changed since their departure by boat months earlier, so the State department no longer deemed asylum necessary, prompting an incident. [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] initially arrived as liaisons to the matter, {{r|X-Factor #82|83}} but were called away by the X-Cutioner's Song, leaving the X-Patriots to their own devices. \n\nThey briefly took over a hospital, prompting a response by the mercenary [[Random (Marshall Stone II)|Random]].{{r|X-Factor #88}} Afterwards, X-Factor accompanied them back to Genosha to address the current political climate.{{r|X-Factor #89|91}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
