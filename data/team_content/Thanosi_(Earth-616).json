He used cloning, sorcery, and technology for these Thanosi.{{r|Infinity Abyss #3}}\n\nAfter tests involving [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]],{{r|Ka-Zar Vol 3 4|11}} [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]],{{r|Thor Annual Vol 2 2000}}{{r|Thor Vol 2 22|25}} and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]{{r|Avengers: Celestial Quest #1|8}} proved the clones a failure due to them exhibiting nihilistic and destructive behaviors, Thanos scheduled them for recycling; however, a secret player blasted a hole in the roof of one of his hideouts' subterranean section, and consequently activated five of the replicants:{{r|Infinity Abyss #3}} [[Armour (Thanosi) (Earth-616)|Armour]], [[Mystic (Earth-616)|Mystic]], [[Omega (Thanosi) (Earth-616)|Omega]], [[Warrior (Thanosi) (Earth-616)|Warrior]], and [[X (Thanosi) (Earth-616)|X]].{{r|Infinity Abyss #1}}\n\nThese Thanosi then banded together to bring about the end of the universe and believed that they could do this by capturing [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]] so he could direct them to the cosmic being [[Atlez (Earth-616)|Atlez]], the Anchor of Reality, and his successor [[Atleza Langunn (Earth-616)|Atleza]]. By killing Atlez and his successor, the universe would come to end (this was actually a scheme created by Atlez to aid Adam in finding his successor Atleza).\n\nX impersonated Thanos using a telepathic illusion and directed [[Pip Gofern (Earth-616)|Pip the Troll]] to kidnap Adam Warlock as he was recovering from insanity on an alien planet.\n\nX required information from Warlock, who previously made contact with Atlez. [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]] located the real Thanos, and with the aid of Warlock, [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]], [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], and [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]], killed four of the the Thanosi. \n\nHowever, the final clone, Omega, had gone to Earth to kill Atlez's successor Atleza and destroy the Earth. Omega was prevented from doing so after being teleported with the heroes to a barren planet where they battled. Thanos transported the heroes back to Earth and had a fleet of alien mercenaries destroy the planet, killing Omega. This allowed Atleza to take Atlez's place as the Anchor of Reality and thus sparing the universe from destruction.{{r|Infinity Abyss #1|6}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Trivia                  = * The Thanosi were introduced by [[Jim Starlin]] in ''[[Infinity Abyss Vol 1|Infinity Abyss]]'' in order to [[Glossary:Retcon|retcon]] the appearances of [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] in [[Ka-Zar Vol 4|''Ka-Zar'' Vol 4]], [[Thor Vol 2|''Thor'' Vol 2]], {{cl|X-Man Annual Vol 1 1998}} and ''[[Avengers: Celestial Quest Vol 1|Avengers: Celestial Quest]]''.\n* In {{cl|She-Hulk Vol 2 #12}}, it was implied that the Thanos defeated by [[Doreen Green (Earth-616)|Squirrel Girl]] in {{cl|GLX-Mas Special #1}} was actually one of the Thanosi, despite [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu]] having verified that he was not. On trial and under oath, Thanos claimed that he had perfected his clones to the point that they were so indistinguishable from him that not even cosmic beings could tell the difference. However, this Thanos was himself a clone with modified memories - leaving whether or not Squirrel Girl defeated the real Thanos somewhat ambiguous.\n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/thanosi.htm Thanosi (Earth-616) at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe]\n}}\n[[Category:Artificial Eternals]]\n[[Category:Artificial Titans]]\n[[Category:2002 Team Debuts]]\n[[Category:Clones of Thanos]]\n[[Category:Clones of Eternals]]\n[[Category:Thanos Experiment]]\n[[Category:Clones Created by Thanos]]\n[[Category:Mutant Eternals (Deviant Syndrome)]]\n[[Category:Thanos Family]]\n[[Category:Clones]]"
