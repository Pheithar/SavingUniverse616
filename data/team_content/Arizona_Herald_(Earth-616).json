Our ongoing '''meal ticket''' as a national newspaper. You know the drill.

After her investigation of a multiple murder at a gas station in [[Arizona (State)|Arizona]] resulted in the first legimitate sighting of the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] following his death after the [[Civil War II|second superhuman civil war]],{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 2}} the Arizona Herald broke the news, and started quickly gaining traction.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 4}} McGee continued making deadlines for the Herald, like landing an exclusive interview with [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] after she and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] captured the Hulk, but then he disappeared when handed over to the covert [[United States Hulk Operations (Earth-616)|U.S. Hulk Operations]].{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 8}}\n\nFollowing the disappearance of [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Betty Ross]], McGee's editor Murray received a tip-off from a contact of his about it, and assigned Jackie to investigate it. Due to their coverage of the Hulk, the board of directors of the newspaper decided to expand into a national newspaper with more staff and a wider distribution.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 16}} Their new offices were located in [[Phoenix (Arizona)|Phoenix]]. The Herald continued being catapulted by Jackie's stories, namely when she reported the existence of Shadow Base, the Hulk Operation's government-funded headquarters with a billion-dollar budget.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 26}}\n\nBecause of the Herald's association with the Hulk, their new offices were one of four sites in Phoenix targeted by giant monster attacks orchestrated by [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]].{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 29}} The giant monster that attacked the Herald was eventually fended off by the Hulk's ally [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]]. Murray and Jackie survived the attack, but many of their colleagues were killed.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 30}} The destruction and casualties caused by the attack put in doubt the future of the newspaper.{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 32}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:Newspapers]]"
