They decided to pull their resources and finally hunt down and kill [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]]. The team consisted of [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]], the human/vampire hybrid who was known to the creatures of the night as the Daywalker, [[Hannibal King (Earth-616)|Hannibal King]], a Vampire detective who vowed never to take a human life and [[Frank Drake (Earth-616)|Frank Drake]], a distant descendant of Dracula himself. The team hunts Dracula with the help of [[Quincy Harker (Earth-616)|Quincy Harker]] and [[Rachel van Helsing (Earth-616)|Rachel van Helsing]]. \n\nThe group became a detective agency with the official name of Borderline Investigations, but to the Vampires they were the Nightstalkers. \n\nIt was revealed that the team was actually formed by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]] as an elaborate to take out the Vampires for good. Dr. Strange had tried to wipe them all out with the [[Montesi Formula]]. This was a spell contained in the Darkhold capable of destroying all vampires utterly. The downside to using the spell is that the effect is temporary. Once the spell is broken, the Vampires it destroyed are returned to life. The spell had started to weaken and worried that Dracula the Lord of the Vampires himself would return. Dr. Strange allowed the team to battle lesser threats to gain experience before the main battle when Dracula does come back to life.{{r|Nightstalkers #1}}\t\n\n===Lilith===\nThe mother of all demons, [[Lilith (Earth-616)|Lilith]], hired Blade's agency to kill Ghost Rider -- the leather-clad, motorcycle-riding Spirit of Vengeance -- and bad-boy Johnny Blaze, the fiery skeleton's former host. After a protracted battle, Blade and company realized they had been duped. The team joined with Ghost Rider and Blaze against Lilith, battling her monstrous minion Meatmarket. {{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 28}} Blade, Drake and King continued their partnership with Ghost Rider and Blaze. Along with Dr. Strange, [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]] the Living Vampire and the [[Darkhold Redeemers (Earth-616)|Darkhold Redeemers]], they formed the [[Midnight Sons]], a group dedicated to preserving the boundaries between our world and the dark realms. The Midnight Sons clashed with Lilith and her demons spawn, the Lilin, in a supernatural contest with Earth as the prize. The Midnight Sons proved victorious, destroying Lilith and her brood. {{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 31}} Blade also rescued his close friend Safron Caulder from the Darkholders. {{r|Marvel Comics Presents #6}}\n\nThe Nightstalkers also battled other threats, such as [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s [[Department of Occult Armaments (Earth-616)|D.O.A. (Department of Occult Armaments)]].{{r|Nightstalkers #2}}{{r|Nightstalkers #3}}{{r|Nightstalkers #4}} \n\nThe Nightstalkers became a part time members of the [[Midnight Sons (Earth-616)|Midnight Sons]].{{r|Midnight Sons Unlimited #1}} {{r|Midnight Sons Unlimited #2}}\n\nThe team work with the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher (Frank Castle)]] to battle [[Shiv (Cult Leader) (Earth-616)|Shiv]] a dangerous cult leader.{{r|Nightstalkers Vol 1 5}} Working together they are able to stop the cult from sacrificing any more people{{r|Nightstalkers Vol 1 6}} The team battle various supernatural threats such as [[Johann Bessler (Earth-616)|Stonecold]]{{r|Nightstalkers Vol 1 7}} and [[Victor Slaughter (Earth-616)|Vic Slaughter]]{{r|Nightstalkers Vol 1 8}}  along with the return of the D.O.A{{r|Nightstalkers Vol 1 9}}{{r|Nightstalkers #11}} They also encountered the dreaded [[Short Circuit (Earth-616)|Short Circuit]]{{r|Nightstalkers #12}} teamed up with an evil alternate reality version of [[Hannibal King (Earth-931113)|Hannibal King]].{{r|Nightstalkers #13}}\t\t\n\nBlade's desire to destroy supernatural enemies led him to be tricked into using the [[Darkhold]].{{r|Nightstalkers #10}}As 'Switchblade' Blade attacked a number of supernatural beings and stole their power in the 'Midnight Massacre'.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 40}} King and the Nightstalkers eventually stop Blade and another page of the Darkhold was used to restore things back to normal. {{r|Ghost Rider/Blaze: Spirits of Vengeance Vol 1 13}}\n\nThe worked with the [[Darkhold Redeemers (Earth-616)|Darkhold Redeemers]] to battle [[Martine Bancroft (Earth-616)|Martine Bancroft]]{{r|Morbius: The Living Vampire Vol 1 16}} and the  [[Lilin]].{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 44}} Who even Doctor Strange could not help. {{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme Vol 1 60}} \n\nThe team battle a new threat called [[Bad Timing (Earth-616)|Bad Timing]] began working with Lilith.{{r|Nightstalkers #14}} The Lilin then teamed up with [[Fallen (Team) (Earth-616)|The Fallen]].{{r|Ghost Rider/Blaze: Spirits of Vengeance #17}}{{r|Morbius: The Living Vampire #17}}{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #146}}{{r|Midnight Sons Unlimited #4}}\n{{r|Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #61}}{{r|Nightstalkers #15}}\n\nThey later battle [[Bloodstorm One (Earth-616)|Bloodstorm]] a clone of Dracula and the first of a line of vampiric shock-troopers utilized by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra's]] [[Department of Occult Armaments (Earth-616)|D.O.A.]].{{r|Nightstalkers #16}} He was created in a lab by [[Gregory Belial (Earth-616)|Lt. Belial]], but as soon as he emerged, he began slaughtering all the Hydra personnel present, including Lt. Belial at the hypnotic command of [[Varnae (Earth-616)|Varnae]].{{r|Nightstalkers #17}}\n\nUpon the eventual weakening of the [[Montesi Formula]], and the return of vampires, Blade encountered and staked a former ally, a now-vampiric [[Taj Nital (Earth-616)|Taj Nital]]. However, the team was unable to prevent its hated quarry, the vampire, from returning to the Earth realm. Blade, Drake and King, who again had become afflicted with vampirism, began their crusade anew to cleanse the world of all bloodsuckers. Blade and his partners clashed with dread lord [[Varnae (Earth-616)|Varnae]]-- supposedly the first vampire, the demon who had visited this hellish curse upon men. King and Drake were slain in a bloody and futile battle. The loss of his compatriots only strengthened Blade's resolve to rid the world of vampires, regardless of the circumstances of their creation. Following their victory, King was cured of his vampirism.{{r|Nightstalkers #18}} \n\n\n| Equipment               = [[Montesi Formula]], [[Darkhold]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = [[Blade's Sword]], [[Exorcist Gun]]\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n* In Blade: Trinity, Abigail Whistler was a member instead of Drake and [[Hannibal King]] was depicted in his non-vampire status.\n| Links                   = \n*Tomb Of Dracula Vol. 1, No. 44 May 1976; Blade meets King; Featuring: Doctor Strange\n*Doctor Strange Vol. 1, No. 61-62 October-December 1983; Featuring: Dracula, The DarkHold\n*Morbius: The Living Vampire Vol. 1, No. 10 June 1993\n*NightStalkers Vol. 1, No. 1-18, November 1992-April 1994\n* 1992 Marvel Universe Cards #177\n* 1993 Marvel Universe Cards #108\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightstalkers_%28comics%29\n}}\n[[Category:Vampire Hunters]]\n[[Category:Detective Agencies]]\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]"
