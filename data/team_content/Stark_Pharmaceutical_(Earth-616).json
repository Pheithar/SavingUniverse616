When the medical vigilante [[Elias Wirtham (Earth-616)|Cardiac]] targeted [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] for his involvement in the pharmaceutical industry, he kidnapped fifteen Stark Pharmaceutical scientists and trapped them inside an impenetrable sphere comprised in part of [[Vibranium]] and [[Adamantium]] so they suffocated to death.\n\nAfter being alerted of the incident, Iron Man confronted Cardiac and attempted to rescue the scientists. Seeing that his weaponry was ineffective against the trap's material, Stark resorted to flying into the sphere at maximum speed, piercing the deadly trap with his arm, and saving the scientists, but mutilating himself in the process.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 2}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
