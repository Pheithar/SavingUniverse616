The Board oversaw S.H.I.E.L.D.'s operations and projects.{{r|Strange Tales #135}}\n\nSome time later, the [[Deltite (Earth-616)|Deltite]], an advanced [[Life-Model Decoy]] of Hydra's leader [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] created by [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]] under Strucker's orders, successfully infiltrated the Council and started replacing the members with other Life-Model Decoys.{{r|Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. #6}}{{r|Fury #1}}\n\nAfter the death of Baron Strucker,{{r|Strange Tales #158}} Hydra split into several factions such as [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] and the [[Secret Empire (Earth-616)|Secret Empire]]. The Council, now composed entirely of LMDs, controlled S.H.I.E.L.D., Hydra, A.I.M. and the Oil Corporation [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]], with the Deltite himself as the new [[Supreme Hydra]].{{r|Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. #4}}\n\nThe Council led [[Project Delta (Earth-616)|Project: Delta]], a secret project to replace S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top agents with advanced LMD duplicates enhanced with Nick Fury's [[Infinity Formula]], giving them immortality.{{r|Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. #1|6}} These LMD were created by Roxxon's [[Encoders (Deltite) (Earth-616)|Encoders]], who worshipped the Deltite as a god.{{r|Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. #4|6}}\n\nAfter Nick Fury and some agents loyal to him killed all the Deltites, including the Executive Board, S.H.I.E.L.D. was shut down by the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]].{{r|Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. #6}}\n\nAfter some time, a new S.H.I.E.L.D., under the direct control of Nick Fury and the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council (Earth-616)|Security Council]] was created.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 7}} At the same time, Baron Wolfgang von Strucker was resurrected thanks to his [[Death Spore Virus]].{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 20}} Hydra then managed to brainwash the original S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, who were replaced by the Deltites and kept in stasis, into working for Hydra.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 43|45}}\n\nThree agents, [[Jasper Sitwell (Earth-616)|Jasper Sitwell]], [[James Woo (Earth-616)|James Woo]] and [[Sidney Levine (Earth-616)|Sidney Levine]], escaped from their stasis pod and created a new Council from which they directed the brainwashed agents like [[Clay Quartermain (Earth-616)|Clay Quartermain]] and [[Laura Brown (Earth-616)|Laura Brown]].{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 43|45}} After Fury defeated the reborn Strucker, the agents were freed from Hydra's psychic control and they rejoined S.H.I.E.L.D.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
