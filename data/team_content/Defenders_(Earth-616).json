protect Earth from usually otherworldly attacks. Many members of the team aren't particularly fond of their teammates, with fights frequently breaking out and many labeling the group as a \"non-team\" for the way they act.\n| PlaceOfFormation          = \n| PlaceOfDefunction         = \n| Creators                  = Roy Thomas; Ross Andru\n| First                     = Marvel Feature Vol 1 1\n| HistoryText               = \n{{Quote|The record of the Defenders has been a proud one so far. I am certain that whatever the future may bring, nothing will ever change that.|[[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Stephen Strange]]|Defenders Vol 1 11}}\n\n===Origins===\nWhile trying to defend Earth from the extra-dimensional, demonic beings called the [[Undying Ones]], Sorcerer Supreme [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Dr. Strange]] manipulated Prince [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] into aiding him,{{r|Sub-Mariner #22}} and then teamed with the monstrous [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] to ward off the demons.{{r|Incredible Hulk #126}} Later, when the Yannian scientist [[Yandroth (Earth-616)|Yandroth]] menaced Earth with the Omegatron doomsday device, Dr. Strange persuaded a reluctant Hulk and Namor to help him thwart Yandroth's scheme, forming the \"non-team\" known as the Defenders.{{r|Marvel Feature #1}} After Yandroth's defeat, Hulk and Namor vowed never to work together again, but Strange managed to hold their informal alliance together over time. Unlike other super-teams, these Defenders had no charter or by-laws, no permanent headquarters, no fixed roster, and little affection for each other.\n\n[[File:Defenders Vol 1 10.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe Defenders' ranks soon grew. Due to the group's unofficial nature, any individual who assisted them could be considered a member, but only a select few fit the two major criteria of true membership: that they consider themselves Defenders, and that they are accepted by the continuing core group as Defenders. Strange's disciple, [[Clea (Earth-616)|Clea]], assisted the team on an irregular basis. The alien [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]]'s longtime link with the Defenders began when they aided him against [[Calizuma (Earth-616)|Calizuma]] and his Warrior Wizards, agents of the Undying Ones.{{r|Defenders #2}} The Asgardian warrior goddess [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] became a mainstay of the team (first in the mortal host body of former Undying Ones follower [[Barbara Norriss (Earth-616)|Barbara Norriss]] and later in her own form) after helping them defeat [[Casiolena (Earth-616)|Casiolena]].{{r|Defenders #4}} The archer [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] fought several battles with the group before leaving their ranks.{{r|Defenders #11}} [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]], a reformed villain and head of Richmond Enterprises, became a long-term core Defender after a near-fatal battle with his ex-partners, the [[Squadron Sinister]], and their extraterrestrial employer [[Nebulon (Earth-616)|Nebulon]] the Celestial Man, who became one of the Defenders' most enduring foes.{{r|Defenders #13|14}}{{r|Defenders #33|38}}{{r|Defenders Annual #1}} The half-demonic [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]] helped rescue the Hulk from Hell{{r|Giant-Size Defenders #2}} and aided the team in other matters, eventually becoming a full Defender. Mercenary super hero [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] reluctantly aided the team in several battles{{r|Defenders #22|25}} until Nighthawk placed him on retainer to secure his full-time services,{{r|Defenders #37}} though Cage felt out of place and soon quit the group.{{r|Defenders #46}} The dissident Russian heroine [[Tania Belinskaya (Earth-616)|Red Guardian]] became a member after being allied to the US to assist in an operation on Nighthawk,{{r|Defenders Vol 1 36|46}} and Barbara Norriss' ex-husband [[Jack Norriss (Earth-616)|Jack Norriss]] became a regular - if sometimes rather unwelcome - associate of the group, at one point even occupying Nighthawk's body for a time.{{r|Defenders #32|35}} Occasionally, their paths (almost) crossed with the mysterious, murderous [[Melf (Earth-616)|Elf with a Gun]], though they somehow never actually encountered him; another Elf later become mixed up in their affairs though, as an agent of the alien [[Tribunals]].\n\nThe team also attracted an eclectic array of recurring associates and occasional members such as [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]],{{r|Giant-Size Defenders #3}} [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]],{{r|Giant-Size Defenders #4}} and [[Eric Payne (Earth-616)|Devil-Slayer]]. [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]], a former model turned superheroine, was the next major long-term recruit.{{r|Defenders #46}} The [[Isaac Christians (Earth-616)|Gargoyle]], an elderly man trapped in a demon's body, joined the Defenders in their quest to prevent the grouping of minor demons known as the [[Six-Fingered Hand]] (Avarrish, Fashima, Hyppokri, Maya, Puishannt, and Unthinnk), who were being manipulated by an alliance of powerful demonlords (Mephisto, Satan [[Marduk Kurios]], Satannish, and Thog), from merging the realms of Hell with Earth.\n\nThe ever-shifting ranks of the Defenders battled menaces such as [[Dormammu (Earth-616)|Dormammu]] dread lord of the Dark Dimension;{{r|Marvel Feature #2}} [[Xemnu (Earth-616)|Xemnu]] the Titan, the psionic alien conqueror; the [[Headmen (Earth-616)|Headmen]], megalomaniacal scientists whose experiments warped their own bodies;{{r|Defenders #31|35}}{{r|Defenders Annual #1}} [[Shazana (Earth-616)|Shazana]] who took control of Nighthawk's ex-girlfriend [[Patricia Starr (Earth-616)|Trish Starr]];{{r|Defenders #41}} [[Elihas Starr (Earth-616)|Egghead]]'s [[Emissaries of Evil (Egghead) (Earth-616)|Emissaries of Evil]];{{r|Defenders #42}} [[Null the Living Darkness (Earth-616)|Null the Living Darkness]] and the [[Undying Ones]], who threatened Earth yet again. The Defenders were even tricked into fighting the Avengers when Dormammu and the Asgardian god [[Loki]] manipulated them into assembling the [[Evil Eye of Avalon]]. After several skirmishes, the two teams joined forces and foiled Dormammu's scheme.\n\nThe Defenders' existence was revealed to the world in an unauthorized television documentary by Valkyrie's friend, filmmaker/television producer [[Aaron English (Earth-616)|Dollar Bill]]. As a result, a horde of well-meaning super heroes arrived at the team's headquarters (the [[Richmond Riding Academy]]) and declared themselves Defenders (while others, such as Captain Mar-Vell, Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers), and [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]], decided against Defenders affiliation); but all of these \"[[Defenders for a Day (Earth-616)|Defenders for a Day]]\" decided to quit after a single harrowing day in action with the team.\n\n[[File:Defenders Vol 1 64.jpg|thumb|left]]\nWhen [[Arisen Tyrk (Earth-616)|Arisen Tyrk]] was deposed as God-King of the extra-dimensional Other Realm, he fled through a damaged portal that split him into various fragments. Some of Tyrk's sentient fragments landed on Earth and plagued the Defenders as the crazed [[Lunatik (Tyrk Fragment) (Earth-616)|Lunatik]] vigilantes while another fragment became drama professor Harrison Turk. Other fragments fell under the control of the powerful other-dimensional sorcerer known as the Unnameable and landed on the alien [[Tunnelworld]], where they allied themselves with the vile Ytitnedion of the Buzzard People. When the Defenders entered Tunnelworld to investigate Lunatik's origins, they joined with [[Aeroika (Earth-616)|Aeroika]] and the alien sorcerer [[Xhoohx (Earth-616)|Xhoohx]], liberating the cylindrical realm from the influence of the Unnameable and Ytitnedion. By this time, the founding Defenders were only occasional participants in the group; they soon quit the team altogether after the race of energy beings known as the [[Tribunals]] hoaxed Strange, Hulk, Namor, and the Silver Surfer into believing that the interaction of their karmic energies would eventually lead to the destruction of Earth. The four heroes split up, resolving never to work together again.\n\n===New Defenders===\n[[File:Defenders Vol 1 125.jpg|thumb|right]]\nWith the team's most powerful members gone, the mutant [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] (an X-Men founder and recent Defenders recruit) tried to reorganize the Defenders as a more formal team: the New Defenders. This team, based at [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|The Angel's]] [[Angel's Aerie|\"Aerie\"]] home in Colorado, consisted of three former [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] (Angel, Beast, and [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]]), former Defenders [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] and [[Isaac Christians (Earth-616)|Gargoyle]], new recruits [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]] and [[Cloud (Earth-616)|Cloud]], later joined by the Atlantean [[Andromeda Attumasen (Earth-616)|Andromeda]], and nominally led by the Angel's long-term girlfriend [[Candace Southern (Earth-616)|Candy Southern]]. Despite a number of early successes though, including their defeat of the [[Secret Empire]], the team was plagued by problems, many of them relating to the [[Dragon of the Moon (Earth-616)|Dragon of the Moon]], a mystical entity which possessed Moondragon. Eventually Valkyrie, Gargoyle, Moondragon, Andromeda, and new recruits [[Betilakk (Earth-616)|Interloper]] and the team's psychotic former adversary [[Manslaughter (Earth-616)|Manslaughter]] were all apparently killed battling the Dragon, and the surviving members (the former X-Men) disbanded the Defenders and went off to found [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]. The apparently deceased members were later resurrected, but most of them have never operated as Defenders since then.\n\nLater, after the Tribunal's apocalyptic prophecy was exposed as a hoax,{{r|Incredible Hulk #370}} Dr. Strange, the Hulk, Namor, and Silver Surfer reunited to battle [[Shanzar (Earth-616)Shanzar]], the Sorcerer Supreme of the Strange Matter dimension, who was trying to resurrect the Elder God known as the [[Wild One (Earth-616)|Wild One]]. Possessing the body of Namor, Shanzar succeeded in performing the ritual needed to bring back the Wild One, but the Defenders were able to trap the Wild One in the Strange Matter dimension, forcing Shanzar to concede defeat.\n\n===Curse of Yandroth===\nThe original Defenders next reunited to once again battle Yandroth, who was tapping the power of the Earth goddess [[Gaea (Earth-616)|Gaea]]\nto cause worldwide chaos. The Defenders prevailed, but a dying Yandroth used Earth's power to place a curse upon the Hulk, Dr. Strange, Namor, and Silver Surfer that automatically united them whenever a catastrophe placed Earth in peril. The curse also had a secret side effect, causing the rationality of the four heroes to be submerged by their more selfish desires. The slain Yandroth's consciousness secretly fed off the violent energy created by the cursed Defenders, planning to be reborn more powerful than ever. Corrupted by the curse, Strange, Namor, Hulk, and Surfer abandoned their fellow Defenders and formed the Order, a group dedicated to ending any perceived threat to world peace by any means necessary. Operating out of the floating metropolis Sky Island, the Order opposed all who challenged their new world order until the remaining Defenders broke Yandroth's curse and restored the Order's humanity. Gaea empowered Nighthawk to gather the Defenders at will should the need arise.\n\n===Last Defenders===\nA version of the Defenders led by Nighthawk was also a part of the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] program, but it is as yet unknown whether these [[Defenders (Initiative) (Earth-616)|\"Last Defenders\"]] will work together again or become a part of the main group.\n\n===Fear Itself===\nA new Defenders featuring [[Alani Ryan (Earth-616)|Loa]], Namor, Dr. Strange, Silver Surfer, and [[Lyra (Earth-8009)|Lyra]] was formed to help in Atlantis' battle against [[Attuma (Earth-616)|Nerkkod]], one of the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]]'s [[Worthy (Earth-616)|Worthy]]. Being outnumbered, Dr. Strange called every hero who was part of the Defenders to help, defeating Nerkkod.{{r|Fear Itself: The Deep #1|4}}\n\n===Chasing Carlo Zota===\nDoctor Strange summoned a new team of Defenders, made up of past members Silver Surfer, Betty Banner (The Red Harpy) and Cloud, when [[Masked Raider III (Earth-616)|The Masked Raider]] informed him that former [[Enclave (Earth-616)|enclave]] scientist [[Carlo Zota (Earth-616)|Carlo Zota]] had used a time-travel spell that could be very dangerous if used in the wrong hands. In order to give Cloud a human form Strange had to submit fully to the will of magic, it took them back to the [[Glossary:Sixth Cosmos|Sixth Cosmos]] on the planet [[Taa]] where they had to face the previous planet-eater [[Moridun (Earth-616)|Omnimax]]{{r|Defenders Vol 6 1}} They teamed up with [[Taaia (Earth-616)|Taaia]] who the Silver Surfer described as that worlds equivalent to a superhero, but they were horrified to discover she was the mother of an infant [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]]. Nonetheless they teamed up with her to stop the planet eater and were able to do so when a scientific device Taaia created was combined with Doctor Strange's magic, while the Silver Surfer fought Zota who had become Omnimax's herald. After it was over Strange's magic dragged them all, alongside Taaia and Zota, further back into the [[Glossary:Fifth Cosmos|Fifth Cosmos]]{{r|Defenders Vol 6 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = Unknown\n| Transportation          = Doctor Strange's teleportation spells\n| Weapons                 = Unknown\n\n| Notes                   = [[File:Defenders Vol 1 62.jpg|thumb|right]]\n* A storyline in issues #63-65 of the original ''Defenders'' run had dozens of new applicants attempting to join the Defenders. All of them left shortly after for various reasons, mostly disappointment with the existing members. Among them were the [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]], [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Marvel Man]] (currently known as Quasar), [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Mar-Vell]], [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]], [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova (Richard Rider)]], [[Brock Jones (Earth-616)|Torpedo]], [[Walter Newell (Earth-616)|Stingray]], [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]], [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Black Goliath]], [[Hector Ayala (Earth-616)|White Tiger]], [[Griffin Gogol (Earth-616)|Captain Ultra]], [[Tagak (Earth-616)|Tagak the Leopard Lord]], [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]], [[Hobie Brown (Earth-616)|Prowler]], [[Jonathan Hart (Earth-616)|Jack of Hearts]], [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Son of Satan]], [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], and the [[Paladin (Earth-616)|Paladin]]. Nineteen heroes joined the [[Defenders for a Day (Earth-616)|Defenders for a Day]].\n* During the \"Defenders for a Day\" incident, a [[Defenders (Villains) (Earth-616)|separate villainous team]] was put together by the [[Life-Model Decoy|LMD]] versions of [[Sagittarius (LMD) (Earth-616)|Sagittarius]] and [[Libra (LMD) (Earth-616)|Libra]] to take advantage of the recent publicity of the team and create public distrust for the Defenders. Members included [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]], [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]], [[Pecos (Earth-616)|Pecos]], [[Georges Batroc (Earth-616)|Batroc]], [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|Beetle]], [[Samuel Smithers (Earth-616)|Plantman]], [[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Whirlwind]], [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]], [[Joe the Gorilla (Earth-616)|Joe the Gorilla]], [[Bruno Horgan (Earth-616)|Melter]], [[Vincent Patilio (Earth-616)|Leap-Frog]], [[Herman Schultz (Earth-616)|Shocker]], [[Frederick Myers (Earth-616)|Boomerang]], [[Alexander Gentry (Earth-616)|Porcupine]], and the [[Norton Fester (Earth-616)|Looter]]. This group participated in a series of running battles throughout [[New York City]] against the expanded Defenders roster until a rage-possessed Valkyrie drove off members of both teams.\n* In the ''Marvel Team-Up'' (Vol. 3) story, The Titannus War, Doctor Strange formed a team of unofficial Defenders, although the name was never mentioned, consisting of himself, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man (Peter Parker)]], Nova, [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]], Ms. Marvel, and the Hulk. Once they confronted [[Titannus (Earth-616)|Titannus]] they were joined by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.comic-covers.com/Marvel/MarvelC-D/Defenders/ Cover gallery: 70's series]\n}}\n[[it:Difensori (Terra-616)]]\n[[Category:Stephen Strange (Earth-616)/Quotes]]"
