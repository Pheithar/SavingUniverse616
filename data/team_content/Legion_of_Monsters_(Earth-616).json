Though Starseed was a benevolent entity, both the [[Jack Russell (Earth-616)|Werewolf by Night]] and [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]], overcome by their monstrous hungers attacked it. [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]] attempted to intervene, but Starseed was unable to overcome his fear of Man-Thing and suffered severe burns at its touch. The dying Starseed attempted to cure the Legion of their monstrous forms but was too weak and died little later.{{r|Marvel Premiere #28}}\n\nTired of fighting and disappointed in their actions the team split up. Though they hardly ever acknowledged themselves as a team in the first place, the Legion of Monsters (minus Ghost Rider) reunited. This incarnation included Morbius, Werewolf, Man-Thing, and new members [[N'Kantu (Earth-616)|Living Mummy]] and [[Manphibian (Earth-616)|Manphibian]].{{r|Legion of Monsters Vol 2 #1|4}}\n\nThey vowed to protect monsters that were hunted down to be killed. One of their missions included saving remaining monsters from the [[Hunter of Monster Special Force (Earth-616)|Hunter of Monster Special Force]]. They sent the monsters into the Morlock Tunnels and started a [[Monster Metropolis]] where the monsters could live in peace. Recently they saved the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] after he was killed by Daken and brought him back to life as FrankenCastle.{{r|Punisher Vol 8 #11|16}}\n\nHe was since returned to his normal form and left the team.{{r|Franken-Castle #21}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n\n}}\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]"
