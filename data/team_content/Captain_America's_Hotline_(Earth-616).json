The hotline service was headquartered in a nondescript building in [[Brooklyn Heights]], [[New York (State)|New York]], and was fully computer-automated so it required no personnel. \n\nIncoming calls were recorded, transferred to printed text, and transmitted by computer to Captain America's portable briefcase terminal, an interface for which was house in his [[Captain America's Van|van]].\n\nAll messages were simultaneously sent to the Stars and Stripes, an independent nationwide network of computer enthusiasts who volunteered to assist Captain America in his data processing. The volunteers scanned all messages, correlating them as to duplication, urgency, and location.\n\nThis information extract was then forwarded by computer through telephone lines to Captain America as he roved the country; thus he had constant access to information regarding his mission to serve the nation.<!-- Plagiarism ends. -->{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 2}}\n\n==Reestablishment==\n[[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Sam Wilson]], the all-new Captain America, reestablished the hotline as part of his effort to connect with the American public. Those seeking Cap's assistance could send in a voicemail, video message, or even a social media post.{{r|Captain America: Sam Wilson Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
