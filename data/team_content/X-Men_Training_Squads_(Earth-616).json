To this end, they formed training squads of four to seven members under teacher-advisers, so that the students could become prepared for the day they may need to defend themselves or even become [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #2}}\n\nIn these groups the students made uniforms, got codenames, and were supervised by their teacher-advisors. The teams participated in small missions or [[Danger Room]] scenarios called '''Field Day Events'''.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #2}} [[Hellions Squad (Earth-616)|Hellions]] won first place in the overall competition and the [[Corsairs Squad (Earth-616)|Corsairs]] came in second.{{r|New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook #1}} \n\n===M-Day and Funerals===\nAfter the events of [[Decimation|M-Day]] only 27 of 182 enrolled Xavier's students retained their powers. The teams were split up, due to deaths and depowerment. Emma Frost gathered all the living students that retained their powers. She made the students go into an all out brawl against each other. The students that Frost observed to be the best were formed into the [[New X-Men (Earth-616)|New X-Men]]. The team of New X-Men included [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]], [[Joshua Foley (Earth-616)|Elixir]], [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]], [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]], [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]], [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] and being led [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]].{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #20}} [[David Alleyne (Earth-616)|Prodigy]] was later added to the roster despite being depowered.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #32}}\n\nFor their protection, the depowered students who had not already left the X-Mansion sneaked out at night, off the Institute grounds, and loaded on to a bus. Unfortunately, Icarus was tricked into leaking this information to [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Rev. William Stryker]] and he had his [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] shoot a missile at the bus, massacring forty-two depowered students. They then attacked the school, attempting to wipe out the survivors, but were defeated.{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 #23|#24}}\n\n==Squad Rosters==\n[[File:Advocates Squad (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 1
