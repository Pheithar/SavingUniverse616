They were inspired by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], whom they knew as [[Patch]] from his time in their country.\n\nWhile brutally taking down a [[Mutant Growth Hormone|MGH]] dealer, the Raksha were interrupted by [[James Hudson Jr. (Earth-1610)|Jimmy Hudson]], who disapproved the lethality of their methods. Norio attacked Jimmy, but was soon subdued by his teammate from the [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|X-Men]], [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]], who arrived to assist Jimmy together with [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]]. The X-Men and the Raksha engaged in a fight which was abruptly stopped by Norio himself once Jimmy popped his claws and Norio recognized their similarity to Wolverine's. After clearing up their intentions, both teams agreed to work together.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 6}}\n\nDuring the beginning of the [[Mothervine]] crisis, the Raksha encountered a group of [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] henchmen. They infiltrated the X-Mansion to inform Magneto about their presence in Madripoor, as well as to check up on the X-Men, since they were concerned they had been compromised after hearing nothing from them for weeks. At the time, the time-displaced members of the young X-Men were off-world due to an emergency mission in space.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 23}} The Raksha remained at the X-Mansion under [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]]' observation, but she fell under the control of the psychic entity [[Alice MacAllister (Earth-1610)|Malice]] and attacked them. Polaris managed to fight off Malice's possession, but not before having brutalized all of the Raksha except Gazing Nightshade.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 24}} Her teammates were hospitalized at the X-Man's infirmary afterwards, and Nightshade herself temporarily joined Polaris' makeshift roster of X-Men to help stop the spread of the Mothervine.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 25}}\n\nHaving recovered, the Raksha teamed up with the X-Men to take down a group of ninja MGH dealers. Since Magneto had returned to his mutant-supremacist roots and the time-displaced X-Men were preparing to return to their era, the young mutants arranged with Polaris and [[Danger (Earth-616)|Danger]] to offer the Raksha the opportunity to become their students at the X-Mansion. The Raksha were initially reluctant, but seemed to take up the offer.{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 36}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Vigilantes]]"
