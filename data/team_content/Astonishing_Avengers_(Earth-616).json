Thus, the heroes became evil, and the villains of Magneto's group became good.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 4}} After the Red Onslaught was defeated, the villains from the group went separate ways.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 3}}\n\nAfter it was noticeable something was wrong with some of the Avengers and the X-Men, [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]] reassembled the inverted villains so they could form the resistance against the inverted heroes.{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 6}} Even though the Astonishing Avengers failed to stop the inverted X-Men,{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 7}} the appearance of the [[Axis (Avengers) (Earth-616)|Axis]] gave them a second wind to keep on fighting{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 8}} long enough for Doctor Doom, the White Skull (the inverted version of the Red Skull), and the Scarlet Witch (possessed by [[Daniel Drumm (Earth-616)|Daniel Drumm]] in order to cooperate) to cast a reinversion spell, which turned almost everyone back to normal.\n\nBefore the battle, the Astonishing Avengers had decided to record a video sent to the media, in which they blamed the evil actions of the Avengers and the X-Men on themselves, claiming to have manipulated the heroes using the [[Amora (Earth-616)|Enchantress]]' magic, as the \"Axis of Evil.\"{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 9}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)/Quotes]]"
