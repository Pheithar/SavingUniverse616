If necessary, Strange would also teleport the team to the location they were needed. At times there seems to be a subtle pattern among those who choose to serve, such as [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] and [[Eric Masterson (Earth-616)|Thunderstrike]], [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Ant Man]] and [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] etc.\n\n===Doctor Druid===\nStrange later forced [[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Doctor Druid]] to take over for him while he was dealing with Salome and the War of the Seven Spheres. Druid and [[Jillian Woods (Earth-616)|Shadowoman]] were asked to protect the [[Moebius Stone]] from evil forces. The Stone ended up empowering [[Cody Fleischer (Earth-616)|Cadaver]], and the three became a regular team of sorts, based out of [[Doctor Druid's Sanctum]] in [[Boston]].\n\nHowever, Druid grew tired of leading the group. Summoning the demon [[Slorioth]], he faked his death and the team disbanded, although Cadaver, Shadowoman and [[Joshua Pryce]] agreed to help each other if needed.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] also assembled his own Secret Defenders team to carry out a mission.
