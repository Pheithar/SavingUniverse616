When the injured Eternal [[Sersi (Earth-616)|Sersi]] fell into the [[Subterranea|subterranean]] hideout of the [[Deviants (Race)|Deviant]], [[Kro (Earth-616)|Kro]], and asked for assistance in rescuing her allies, the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], he facilitated his Delta Network to discover other members of his race who were looking to build a better life for themselves and other [[Deviants (Race)|Deviants]]. \n\nKro detected and recruited [[Enigmo (Earth-616)|Enigmo]], a wrestler in the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]], [[Dragona (Earth-616)|Dragona]], self appointed protector of her people, [[Karkas (Earth-616)|Karkas]] and [[Ransak the Reject (Earth-616)|Ransak]], two [[Deviants (Race)|Deviants]] who were trying to become actors, Kro's own children Deborah & Donald Ritter, with the power to merge into one powerful super being called [[Deborah & Donald Ritter (Earth-616)|Tzabaoth]], and [[Toro Rojo (Earth-616)|El Toro Rojo]], a former wrestler who was now trapped in a Red Bull Totem owned by a young autistic boy. \n\nThe team went with Sersi to [[Lemuria (Pacific Ocean)|Lemuria]] where they tried to stop the forces of [[Ghaur (Earth-616)|Ghaur]] as well as a group of mind controlled [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. Even though they saved the Avengers, both Delta Force had no choice but to leave Lemuria with Ghaur incharge. They did this out of fear of throwing their society in complete chaos if the beat him. Kro ensured Delta Force that they stopped Ghaur in time.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/deltaf.htm\n}}"
