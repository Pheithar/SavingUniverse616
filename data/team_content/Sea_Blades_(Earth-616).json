Years ago they took over a settlement of displaced Atlanteans, displacing them yet again. Led by [[Karris (Earth-616)|Karris]], they had been pillaging the dark corners of the sea.\n\nWhen [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|King Namor]] sought them out to have them rejoin Atlantis, Karris insulted Namor and one of his warriors drew Namor's blood with his sword. Namor then used his newly acquired hydrokinesis to expose the entire settlement to the air and leave all the Sea Blades temporarily gasping for water. Witnessing Namor's new power and being told of Namor's plan, Karris and the Sea Blades accompanied him back to [[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantis]].{{r|Invaders Vol 3 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Sea creatures\n| Weapons                 = Swords, Spears\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
