It is one of the largest fuel conglomerates around the world. The Corporation generated billions of dollars in profits each year by refining and manufacturing products related to oil through its many holdings. Like any business enterprise, the goal of Roxxon was to increase their profits, and it was unclear if all its businesses were entirely legitimate. In fact, Roxxon had been involved in many activities morally questionable or illegal, including blatant violent crimes, but this fact was unknown to most consumers and the general public.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 11}} In the early 21st century, the corporation's annual revenue exceeded $500 billion, it employed over 100,000 men and women, and operated in 28 countries.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 7}}\n\n| History                 = \n===Origin===\nRoxxon began as the \"Roxxon Oil Company\" a small oil engineering business in the early 20th century in the [[United States of America]].{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #9}}\n\nBy [[World War II]] the [[Roxxon Oil Company]] had become a major northeastern US supplier with a exemplary record in the industry. This all changed when rival company Republic Oil and Natural Gas was formed and incorporated by [[J.T. Jones (Earth-616)|J.T. Jones]], a ruthless [[Texan]] oil magnate. Jones built the company into a profitable corporation and, on his death, the control of the company went to his son [[Hugh Jones (Earth-616)|Hugh Jones]] who took control of both the \"Roxxon Oil Company\" and \"Republic Oil and Natural Gas\" and merged them to create the Roxxon Energy Corporation.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #9}}\n\nRoxxon was one of the early funders of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], however they also had ties to [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] as they helped them smuggle weapons in Roxxon tanker trucks. This was discovered by S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Rick Stoner (Earth-616)|Rick Stoner]], but he was murdered before he could report it.{{r|Fury #1}}\n\n===Hugh Jones===\nRoxxon jumped to fame as something more than a business enterprise when its then chairman, [[Hugh Jones (Earth-616)|Hugh Jones]], was abducted by the second [[Serpent Squad (Roxxon Oil) (Earth-616)|Serpent Squad]]. The Squad members were actually agents of the [[Serpent Crown]], an object of great mystical power, built by the evil [[Set (Earth-616)|Set]] and uncovered when Roxxon used their machines to investigate the sunken city of [[Lemuria (Pacific Ocean)|Lemuria]]. [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], in his short career as the Nomad, rescued Jones and clashed with the Serpent Squadron, prompting the Crown to be lost. However, Jones was forced to wear the Crown during his captivity, creating a mental link between the Crown and Jones that would last for a lifetime.{{r|Captain America #180|181}}\n\nThis mental nexus enabled Jones to trace the Crown, and he sent employees of Roxxon to recover it. Once found, Jones began wearing the Crown again, but it was invisible to anyone that wasn't aware of the Crown's existence. Jones used the powers granted to him by the Crown to enact a corporate conspiracy in an attempt to dominate the United States' government. During this plan, Jones made contact with [[Nelson Rockefeller (Earth-712)|President Nelson Rockefeller]] of [[Earth-712]], which is also the home of the [[Squadron Supreme (Earth-712)|Squadron Supreme]]. President Rockefeller was also under the influence of a Serpent Crown, the Crown from Earth-712. When the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] attempted to stop Jones' plans, he transported them to Earth-712,{{r|Avengers #144}} to be challenged and defeated by the Squadron Supreme, who were being manipulated by Jones and President Rockefeller. Instead, the Avengers stole Earth-712's Serpent Crown and freed the Squadron Supreme from its influence. The Avengers returned and defeated Jones and his crown-controlled minion [[Orka (Earth-616)|Orka]].{{r|Avengers #147|149}}\n\nAlthough Earth-712 was saved, the Avengers inadvertently made Earth-616 more dangerous, now that two Serpent Crowns exist on the same Earth. The Avenger known as [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] dropped the Serpent Crown from Earth-712 in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, believing that nobody could find it there. But the mental link between Jones and the Crown allowed Jones to find it. He formed a new version of the Serpent Squadron, consisting of Roxxon employees who were genetically mutated, and sent them to retrieve the Crown. Despite opposition from [[Walter Newell (Earth-616)|Stingray]] and [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]], the new Serpent Squadron recovered the Crown. After the second Crown was delivered to Jones by the leader of this new Serpent Squadron, [[Seth Voelker (Earth-616)|Sidewinder]], Jones moved to [[Washington DC]], where he used the power of two Crowns to control the minds of members of Congress. His plans were thwarted by Stingray, the Thing and the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]. Finally, the Thing managed to remove the Crown from the head of Jones. He went crazy because of their traumatic separation of the Crown, and even months after the Crown was destroyed, Jones remained in a mental hospital. [[John Gamelin (Earth-616)|John T. Gamelin]], previously Roxxon's Vice President in Charge of Foreign Matters, replace Jones as chairman of Roxxon.{{r|Marvel Team-Up #87}}\n\nRoxxon then pursued an expensive and elaborate project, the installation of [[Star Well I]], a massive orbiting platform that would absorb sunlight and send the converted energy back to Earth. Star Well's designer was Doctor Arthur Dearborn, who submitted to a voluntary mutagenic treatment to transform him into [[Arthur Dearborn (Earth-616)|Sunturion]]. Then, an accident occurred in [[Allantown]], Iowa, killing over two-hundred people. [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] went to Iowa to investigate the accident and discovered a camouflaged radar installation. During his investigation, Iron Man and Sunturion briefly clashed, but then had to work together when the Star Well lost hold of its orbit and fell towards Earth. To stop the Star Well from crashing into a populated Florida area, Sunturion channeled himself into Iron Man's armor. With their combined powers, Iron Man and Sunturion were able to disintegrate the falling station, but Sunturion appeared to die, apparently sacrificing himself to destroy the Star Well. The remaining components of the Star Well continued to operate in orbit.{{r|Iron Man #143|144}}\n\t\n[[File:Roxxon, Joy Mercado (Earth-616) from Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 20.jpg|thumb|left|Roxxon's logo.]]Roxxon's illegal activities have not always remained hidden from the government. [[Raymond Royton]] of the Department of Justice appointed a special investigator on possible illegal activities within Roxxon, who in turn, hid any evidence of fraud within the company. Nevertheless, Roxxon was unable to prevent the opening of an inquest into its scientific branch, the [[Brand Corporation]], whose illegal activities were brought to light by the actions of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[Jackson Arvad (Earth-616)|Will o' The Wisp]]. To prevent an investigation from exposing any possible link between Roxxon and the Brand Corporation, the president of Roxxon closed all Brand plants, including its main facility in [[Queens]], New York.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #234|236}}\n \nRoxxon has developed other illicit activities, such as stealing the comatose body of [[James Hudson]], abducting several super-powered beings to analyze their powers, and joining a conglomerate of major companies to launch an attack on the [[Stark Industries|Stark Company]]. Most recently [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] uncovered a sinister plot involving Roxxon CEO Calvin Hardeman. Hardeman was indicted and replaced as CEO by [[Don Kaminski (Earth-616)|Don Kaminski]].{{r|Captain America Annual #1999}}\n\n===[[Heroic Age (Event)|Heroic Age]]===\nDuring the [[Dark Reign]], Roxxon was mining on [[Mars]]. Their operations were halted by the discovery of an unknown civilization controlled by the [[Shadow Council (Earth-616)|Shadow Council]]. The Shadow Council's agents terminated Roxxon's staff, who were under the influence of a new [[Serpent Crown]]. The lost workers were simply erased from Roxxon's staff listing. The Serpent Crown was sent to Earth, tracked by both the Shadow Council and [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]]' [[Secret Avengers (Black Ops Unit) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]]. Eventually The Secret Avengers discovered the Crown to be in the possession of Mr. Bromley, Roxxon's Vice President. The Secret Avengers went to [[Dubai]] and stole this new Crown from Bromley.\n\nEventually, the new Serpent Crown was stolen from the Secret Avengers by [[Max Fury (Earth-616)|Max Fury]], a member of the Shadow Council, and a third Crown was found by [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] on Mars. While under the Crown's influence, Nova commanded the Shadow Council's agents to dig the surface for an unknown mean, using Roxxon's equipment.\n\nThe Shadow Council sent four kamikaze pilots armed with atomic bombs to terminate the Serpent Crown's pawns and the Secret Avengers, but [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] managed to make the bombs explode during the teleportation, destroying the Shadow Council's citadel on Earth and Roxxon's installation on Mars, but leaving the Avengers unharmed.{{r|Secret Avengers #1|5}}\n\n===Mentallo===\n[[Marvin Flumm (Earth-616)|Mentallo]] tried to take control of the creatures on [[Monster Isle]] on behalf of the Roxxon Corporation who wanted to drill for oil there.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 #36|37}} He was however stopped by the Mutant heroes the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] He tried to flee with the billion dollars promised to him by Roxxon, but one of the monsters got hold of it and dropped the pile of money on him.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 #39|41}}\n\n===Dario Agger===\n[[Dario Agger (Earth-616)|Dario Agger]] became the CEO and strove to make as much as money as possible regardless of the effects on the environment and uses Roxxon's vast financial resources to pay for lobbyists and lawyers in order to exploit and pollute as much as he wanted without consequence.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #19.NOW}} One of his most frequent critics was S.H.I.E.L.D. environmental agent [[Rosalind Solomon (Earth-616)|Rosalind Solomon]]. When Agent Solomon learned that Dario and Roxxon had mined ice mined from Europa, one of the moons of the planet Jupiter, and were planning to sell it as well for a lot of money, Solomon decided to teach them a lesson by convincing [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], the god of thunder, to bring an even larger chunk of ice from the realm of Jotunheim and give it away for free. Dario brushed off Thor's interference at first.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #19.NOW}} However, Dario was forced to deal with Thor after the god was motivated to fight Roxxon after Agent Solomon explained the company's negative effects on the environment. Thor's first act against Roxxon was to destroy some of its factories with a blast of lightning. Dario angrily asked his lawyers what they should do. When his lawyers didn't give a satisfactory answer, Dario fed some of them to bloodthirsty bears.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #20}}\n\nDario got back at Thor for destroying his factories by building a floating island full of factories above Broxton, OK, which heavily polluted the town. Dario knew this would infuriate Thor and waited for the god of thunder to appear on the floating island he built. When Thor arrived, Dario and his remaining lawyers slapped Thor with a lawsuit for destroy Roxxon's factories and with an injunction that forbade him from entering Broxton.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #21}} Thor was undeterred by the injunction and sneaked into Broxton looking for a way to stop Dario. Thor eventually confronted Dario as he was ordering people out of a diner he planned to tear down. That was when Dario sprang his trap. Dario had made a secret deal with the leader of the Rock Trolls, [[Ulik (Earth-616)|Ulik]], that allowed Ulik and a large group of Trolls to live beneath Broxton in exchange for attacking Thor. The Trolls attacked and killed Dario's remaining lawyers.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #22}} Dario told the Trolls that they could do what they want to Broxton. Dario also revealed his true form as the Minotaur to Thor and explained that his ultimate goal was to exploit all of Earth's natural resources before moving on to a new area. The Trolls were ultimately defeated by the combined forces of the Asgardians and S.H.I.E.L.D., but Ulik was able to flee and Broxton was left in ruins. Dario pleaded ignorance to the whole incident.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #23}} Through a media campaign, Dario was able to pin the Trolls' attack on Broxton on the Asgardians and their presence in the United States. After giving a speech that blasted the Asgardians, he was confronted by Agent Solomon and punched in the face. Dario threatened legal action against Solomon, but Solomon reminded Dario that he had killed off all of his lawyers. Dario later met with Ulik and asked the Troll about the Nine Realms as he would like to exploit them next.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #24}}\n\nHe forged a pact with [[Malekith the Accursed]]: when Malekith and his allies conquered a [[Glossary:Ten Realms|world]], Roxxon would be given exclusive rights to essentially strip mine it.{{r|Thor Vol 4 6}} Dario was recruited on to the [[Dark Council (Earth-616)|Dark Council]].Their first act of war was the massacre of the [[Light Elves]] of [[Alfheim]], an event Malekith surely expected would bring the attention of [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Thor]]. Because of this, they tasked one person that was seeking admittance in the council, [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]], with carrying out the murder of the Goddess of Thunder.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 1}}\n\n==Locations==\nThe main headquarters of the Roxxon Oil Company is in the Roxxon Plaza, in New York.
