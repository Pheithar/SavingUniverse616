They live in an unassailable mountain fortress according to the [[Anchorite Sect (Earth-616)|Anchorite Sect]].\n \nThe Warriors of Krieger Sect were one among the many sects that attended the once in a century vampire gathering. When [[Xarus (Earth-616)|Xarus]], son of [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]], assassinated his father, the Warriors of Krieger turned against Xarus and returned to their fortress where they were attacked by the [[Nosferatu Sect (Earth-616)|Nosferatu Sect]] and [[Charniputra Sect (Earth-616)|Charniputra Sects]]. They were massacred by both forces along with their leader Legate.\n| Equipment               = '''[[Lightbender Amulet|Sunlight Pendant]]'''\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Vampire Organizations]]"
