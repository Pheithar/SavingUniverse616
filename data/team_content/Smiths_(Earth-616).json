Due to the company suffering a shortage in the department of robotics, they had to make-do, and the Smiths are partially run on the compatibility algorithm from a dating app.\n\nBased on little guidance from [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]], the Smiths built the [[Hulkbot 3000 (Earth-616)|Hulkbot 3000]] with the purpose to test out a behavior-modifying prototype device. Before testing out the device, the Hulkbot malfunctioned and went on a rampage, destroying one of the Smiths before being shut down by Stark. The Smiths were later deployed to defend the [[Stark Unlimited HQ]] from the [[Asgardian Dragons|dragon]] [[Sadurang (Earth-616)|Sadurang]],{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 12}} and subsequently repaired the [[Manticore (Vehicle)|Manticore]].{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 13}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] named the Smiths after the rock band from the '80s of the [[wikipedia:The Smiths|same name]].{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 12}}\n* Due to the Smith's systems making use of a dating app algorithm to function, the robots thought Stark and [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|Jim Rhodes]] were a couple.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 12}}\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Stark Robots]]\n[[Category:Robots (Full Listing)]]"
