Three of those speedsters, [[Momenta (Earth-616)|Momenta]], [[Zig-Zag (Earth-616)|Zig-Zag]], [[Whiz Kid (Earth-616)|Whiz Kid]], were hired by the law firm of [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway (Earth-616)|Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]] to operate the mail room effectively. When they were hired, it was agreed that they'd not be placed in harm's way, since, when injured, most speedsters bleed out at super speed.{{r|She-Hulk Vol 1 11}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Notes                   = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
