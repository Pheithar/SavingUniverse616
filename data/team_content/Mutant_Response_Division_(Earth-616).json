[[Beautiful Dreamer (Morlock) (Earth-616)|Beautiful Dreamer]] was the first victim and she was released into a [[Friends of Humanity (Earth-616)|Friends of Humanity]] rally in [[Ames]], [[Iowa (State)|Iowa]] killing eleven hundred humans. Next was [[Fever Pitch (Earth-616)|Fever Pitch]] in [[Jackson Hole]], [[Wyoming (State)|Wyoming]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 12}}\n\nThe next target was the [[United Nations]], and [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom Boom]], [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]] and [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]] were all abducted for this purpose. While Hellion and Surge were sent to the U.N., Boom Boom was kept as a decoy with the Leper Queen to lure the X-Force into killing her.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 13}} [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] was successful in stopping the final attacks, narrowly saving Boom Boom, Hellion and Surge and killing the Leper Queen.These mutant caused mass murders were meant to compel the world to responded to the perceived mutant threat  and the were successful. Because of these incident, the U.N. formed the '''Mutant Response Division''' on [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar Trask]] and [[Stephen Lang (Earth-616)|Stephen Lang]]'s proposal, led as well by [[Sebastion Gilberti (Earth-616)|Bastion]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 #17|18}} \n\n[[File: X-Factor Vol 1 204 Textless.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The MRD targeting [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations]]]]\n===Second Coming===\n[[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar Trask]], the inventor of the [[Sentinels]], used his connections in [[Washington, D.C.]] and the U.N. to be placed in a high ranking position in the newly formed Mutant Response Division to deal with the few mutants outside of [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] specifically [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations crew]], but other mutants across the globe were targeted. After running several scenarios, Trask and his senior officers decided that the best approach for exterminating them was to lure them outside of the densely populated city. The MRD hired the [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|The Absorbing Man]] to set a trap.{{r|X-Factor #204}} Luckily X-Factor escaped, and went into hiding.{{r|X-Factor #205}}\n\nThe MRD officers also attempted take out [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]] in [[Ireland]], but were thwarted by the arrival of [[Gaveedra Seven (Mojoverse)|Shatterstar]] and [[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|Layla Miller]]. The pair rescued Banshee,{{r|X-Factor #205}} and teleported back to New York City.{{r|X-Factor #206}}\n\nThe MRD officers also followed [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]] and [[Guido Carosella (Earth-616)|Strong Guy]] into [[South America]].{{r|X-Factor #203}} However, before the troops could lead an attack, Monet, Strong Guy, and [[Cartier St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet's father]] were all transported with [[Karl Mordo (Earth-616)|Baron Mordo]] to New York City.{{r|X-Factor #206}}\n\nThe MRD launched one final assault on X-Factor, with Trask leading in his Dread-X. [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]] used her telepathic abilities on Trask briefly freeing him from Bastion's control. Trask used this small window of freedom to commit suicide after telling the MRD soldiers to retreat. Colonel Moran continued the charge, but was defeated by X-Factor.{{r|X-Factor #206}}\n\nLike Trask, [[Stephen Lang (Earth-616)|Stephen Lang]], the Head of Project: Armageddon, was placed in a high ranking position in the Mutant Response Division. As Trask is dealing with the mutant population in [[New York City]], Lang is hunting mutants in more remote locations. He was stationed in [[Portugal]] to eliminate [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]] at his safe house/brothel in [[Monsanto]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 13}}\n\nWhen [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]] became the head of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], he voiced disapproval for the MRD.{{r|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}} It is unknown, however, if the MRD program still exists or was cancelled.\n| Equipment               = MRD Armor\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Guns with laser sights\n| Notes                   = * The Mutant Response Division (or MRD) was originally conceived in the [[Wolverine and the X-Men (animated series)|''Wolverine and the X-Men'']] television series.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Government Organizations]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]\n[[Category:United Nations Organizations]]"
