[[Nathan Summers (Stryfe) (Earth-4935)|Stryfe]] founded the group sometime after coming to the 20th century (from roughly 2,000 years in the future). They were likely assembled as a tool while Stryfe assembled his master plan<ref>[[X-Cutioner's Song]]</ref>. The exact size of the organization is unknown, but they were seen to have had several advanced bases around the world, and employed a number of presumably human guards.\n\nWhen the team first appeared, their mission was to rescue [[Russell Collins (Earth-616)|Rusty]] and [[Sally Blevins (Earth-616)|Skids]], two [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] who had been captured by the government. Rusty and Skids would not be seen for some time later, but when they were it was revealed that they stayed with the group due to mind control devices Stryfe implanted in them. It was never indicated that any of the others members had similar implants.\n\nAfter the organization was dismantled, four of the imprisoned members ([[Richard Gill (Earth-616)|Wildside]], [[Pantu Hurageb (Earth-616)|Reaper]], [[Michael McCain (Earth-616)|Forearm]] and [[Heather Tucker (Earth-616)|Tempo]]) were liberated and recruited by a mysterious villain named [[Reignfire (Earth-616)|Reignfire]], who was believed to be a futuristic version of Sunspot. Already among the ranks of the new MLF were former New Mutant member [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Moonstar]] (undercover on behalf of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]]) and [[Rayna Piper (Earth-616)|Locus]]. X-Force's [[Maria Callasantos (Earth-616)|Feral]] also defected to the MLF, and Tempo betrayed them and went her own way. After a few minor missions, including a group that infiltrated [[Muir Island]] to obtain information on the [[Legacy Virus]], the group was captured by members of [[Operation Zero Tolerance|Operation: Zero Tolerance]].{{Citation}}\n\n===Krakoa===\nThe MLF relocated to [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] to be a part of the mutant nation.{{R|New Mutants Vol 4 9}}\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = [[Ambient-Energy Dampening Actualization Module Unit Zero (Earth-4935)|Zero]]'s teleportation\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_Liberation_Front\n* http://www.marvel.com/universe/Mutant_Liberation_Front\n}}"
