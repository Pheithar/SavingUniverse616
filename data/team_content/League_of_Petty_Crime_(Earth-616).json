He convinced a quartet of criminals to join his organization, promising them protection from within the prison while providing them with a cut of their stolen gains.\n\nThe operation attracted the attention of the [[Robert Frank (Earth-616)|Whizzer]] who attempted to stop them from mugging people on the street. As he chased the crooks, Warden Balew drove his car into the path of the Whizzer, pretending it to be an accident.\n\nLater, when the gang was sent out to rob a local carnival, they were chased once again by the Whizzer. Trying to escape on a roller coaster, the crooks were easily captured by the yellow speedster. They quickly revealed who their employer was, and the Whizzer then brought Balew to justice, ending the League of Petty Crime one and for all.{{r|All Winners Comics Vol 1 5}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Warden Balew provided a getaway car for his gang.\n| Weapons                 = Each member was armed with a pistol.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
