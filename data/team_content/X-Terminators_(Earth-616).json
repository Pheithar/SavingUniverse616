Their ranks included [[Russell Collins (Earth-616)|Rusty Collins]], the young [[Arthur Maddicks (Earth-616)|Artie Maddicks]], runaway [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom-Boom]], Mexican immigrant [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]], and former [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] [[Sally Blevins (Earth-616)|Skids]] and [[Leech (Earth-616)|Leech]]. When X-Factor revealed their mutant natures to the world, they feared for the children's safety, and also came to realize that things were not adequate at X-Factor headquarters to teach the students, so they were enrolled in private schools.{{r|X-Terminators Vol 1 1}}\n\nRusty attempted to turn himself over to the military to obey the law following his accidental burning of a prostitute and subsequent warrant out for his arrest.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 33}} Skids, Boom-Boom, and Rictor were enrolled in summer school at Philips Academy, while Artie and Leech were sent to St. Simons school where they made friends with paraplegic mutant [[Takeshi Matsuya (Earth-616)|Takeshi Matsuya]].{{r|X-Terminators Vol 1 1}} They were all soon drawn together to prevent the demon [[N'astirh (Earth-616)|N'astirh]] from capturing thirteen mutant babies that he needed to sacrifice in order to open a portal between Earth and [[Limbo]], in a conflict referred to as the [[Inferno (Event)|Inferno]]. They took on the name the \"X-Terminators\", naming themselves after the name that X-Factor used when operating as mutants during the time that X-Factor were publically posing as mutant hunters.{{r|X-Terminators Vol 1 2|3}} Ultimately, the X-Terminators teamed up with the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] and helped save the thirteen captured babies and closing N'astirh's portal in Manhattan.{{r|X-Terminators Vol 1 4}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 72|74}}\n\nFollowing the end of Inferno, the X-Terminators disbanded when Artie, Leech, and Taki returned to St. Simons. Rusty, Skids, Boom-Boom, and Rictor all joined the New Mutants, serving with the team for a time.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 40}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 76}}\n\nIn the present day, [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] formed a team to assist him in a mission on [[Breakworld]] which, although [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom-Boom]] declared the team an [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] reunion, [[Takeshi Matsuya (Earth-616)|Wiz Kid]] dubbed the All-New X-Terminators since X-Force was taken. The team successfully managed to obtain the necessary Breakworld technology, turn it into a gun, and appropriate it for Krakoa's use, and Cable noted that he would call on these allies again.{{r|Cable: Reloaded Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The team name X-Terminators dates back all the way to when X-Factor was first formed.
