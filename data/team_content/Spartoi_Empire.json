While they are not necessarily allies, they have attempted a political union in the past and do not consider one another to be enemies.{{r|Inhumans Vol 3 3|4}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * The '''Spartoi Empire''' of the '''Spartoi''' race from the planet '''Spartax''' was first mentioned as the homeworld of '''Prince Jason''' who was heir to the throne of the Empire.{{r|Inhumans Vol 3 2}} This Spartax was located in the Sparta star system of the [[Greater Magellanic Cloud]]{{r|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files Vol 1 1|; Spartoi's entry}} and this [[Jason (Spartoi) (Earth-616)|Prince Jason]] was intended to be a younger version of the [[Jason (Earth-791)|Emperor Jason]] who ruled his empire from the planet [[Sparta (Planet)|Sparta]] and was the biological father of [[Peter Quill (Earth-791)|Star-Lord]].{{r|Marvel Preview Vol 1 11}}\n* A subsequent retcon by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] revealed that the biological father of the [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] who was born on [[Earth-616]] was actually '''King J'Son''',{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 0.1}} ruler of the '''Spartax Empire''' of the '''Spartax''' race from the planet '''Spartax'''.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 3}}\n* The fact that the Spartoi Prince Jason and the Spartax King J'Son could not possibly be the same person meant that their respective planets, both named Spartax, could also not be the same.\n* Due to retcons, some of the information from the [[Spartoi]] entry presented in {{cl|Annihilation: The Nova Corps Files Vol 1 1}} is no longer accurate. This includes the idea that Jason had an uncle named Gareth, that Peter Quill (the then-former Star-Lord) was half Spartoi, and (probably) that the Spartoi Empire had been drawn into a prolonged war with the [[Ariguans]] following the cancellation of a planned alliance between the Spartoi and the [[Shi'ar Empire]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Shi'ar Galaxy]]\n[[Category:Empires and Civilizations]]"
