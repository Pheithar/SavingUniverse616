In doing so they found the lab of [[Robert Hellsgaard (Earth-616)|Robert Hellsgaard]], and while there they opened the portal to [[Limbo]] and freed him from his prison.\n\nWith Hellsgaard's technical support, they went on to kill all the super-monsters in Japan. After that they killed vampires, werewolves, yetis, and poltergeists, but eventually they started to kill mutants and even disfigured people.\n\nAfter exterminating the monsters on [[Monster Isle]], they discovered and proceeded to attack [[Monster Metropolis]] which contained the [[Legion of Monsters (Earth-616)|Legion of Monsters]] and the newly revived [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] (who was rebuilt as Frankencastle).\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Swords made of silver\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Japanese Organizations]]"
