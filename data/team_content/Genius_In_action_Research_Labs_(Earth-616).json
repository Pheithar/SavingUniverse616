Nadia next went to the [[Lower East Side]] and spoke with [[Lunella Lafayette (Earth-616)|Lunella Lafayette]];{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 2}} however, although the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] liked the idea, she was too busy to commit to the project herself.\n\nJarvis then took Nadia to [[Times Square]], but the person she wanted to talk with didn't work until later that night, so they continued to the [[Brownsville]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], where [[Priscilla LaShayla Smith (Earth-616)|Shay Smith]] joined G.I.R.L.'s ranks.\n\nReturning to [[Manhattan#Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]], Nadia finally met with the last name on her list, [[Priya Aggarwal (Earth-616)|Priya Aggarwal]]; however, the young woman stated she wasn't interested,  as she'd rather be popular than smart.{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 3}} She soon changed her mind though when Nadia donned the [[Wasp's Suit]] and saved Priya's mother from [[Marian Pouncy (Earth-616)|Poundcakes]] and [[Hellen Feliciano (Earth-616)|Letha]] of the [[Grapplers (Earth-616)|Grapplers]].{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 4}}\n| Equipment               = [[Wasp's Suit]] and [[Bio-Synthetic Wings]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * Writer [[Jeremy Whitley]] created G.I.R.L. in order to highlight women scientists in the Marvel universe, and bring more diversity to a field consisting mostly of adult male characters. <ref>Nerdist: [https://nerdist.com/article/unstoppable-wasp-interview-sam-maggs-jeremy-whitley/ UNSTOPPABLE WASP Writers Discuss Nadia Van Dyne, July 28, 2020]</ref> \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Jeremy Whitley/Creator]]\n[[Category:Elsa Charretier/Creator]]\n[[Category:Think Tanks]]"
