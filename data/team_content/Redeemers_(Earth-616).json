They were created as a mirror of the original Thunderbolts:\n*Citizen V \u2013 John Watkins III, the real grandson of the original Citizen V that Zemo pretended to be (possessed by Zemo at this time)\n*Smuggler \u2013 Conrad Josten, [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Atlas]]'s younger brother, using Erik's second super-villain identity\n*Beetle \u2013 Leila Davis, an old foe of [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|Abner Jenkins]] in his super-villain identity\n*Meteorite \u2013 Valerie Barnhardt, using [[Karla Sofen (Earth-616)|Moonstone]]'s heroic identity\n*Scream \u2013 analog to [[Melissa Gold (Earth-616)|Screaming Mimi]] (and secretly her ex-boyfriend Angar the Screamer)\n*Fixer \u2013 formerly Techno of the Thunderbolts, back in his original criminal identity and forced to work for the CSA\n\nThe Redeemers managed to learn that the conspiracy involved a mind-controlled [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Peter Gyrich]]. When the Redeemers confronted Gyrich, he used nanites to control them and make them fight the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] team. After the Thunderbolts were disbanded and most members pardoned, [[Helen Takahama (Earth-616)|Jolt]] and [[Charles Burlingame (Earth-616)|Charcoal]] were added to the Redeemer program. The team trained, briefly, with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Thunderbolts #50}}\n\n[[Franklin Hall (Earth-616)|Graviton]] returned to [[Earth]], looking to fight the Thunderbolts. Finding the Redeemers at [[Mount Charteris|Mt. Charteris]] instead, he attacked and massacred the entire team.  [[David Angar (Earth-616)|Scream]] vanished in a vacuum and Charcoal was ripped apart and spread across the desert as dust.  The gravitational forces keeping Jolt's bioelectric form together were removed, dispersing her body, while [[Valerie Barnhardt (Earth-616)|Meteorite]] was left floating in the upper atmosphere to suffocate.  The [[Leila Davis (Earth-616)|Beetle's]] armor was crushed into a tiny box and [[Conrad Josten (Earth-616)|Smuggler]] was apparently hurled into the Sun.  [[John Watkins III (Earth-616)|Citizen V]] and [[Paul Norbert Ebersol (Earth-616)|Fixer]] survived the assault, but the Redeemers were no more. Years later it was discovered that Smuggler had survived by teleporting into the darkforce dimension. Baron Zemo used Conrad's life as a bargaining chip to ensure Atlas would help him defeat Genis.{{Citation}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each teammates' arsenal\n\n| Notes                   = * [[Helen Takahama (Earth-616)|Jolt]] was able to pull herself back together, and rejoin the Thunderbolts.  \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redeemers_%28comics%29 Wikipedia: Redeemers]\n\n}}\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D.
