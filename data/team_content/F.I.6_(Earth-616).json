It was headed by Brigadier Theobold \u2018Inky\u2019 Blott, and employed the superhero Micromax. \n===History===\nMicromax came into conflict with Nightcrawler and his N-men as they mounted a rival investigation with Dai Thomas and the clairvoyant Miss Emilia Witherspoon.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 #45}}\n\nWhen the psychic esper division of F.I.6 detected a superhuman hiding in a derelict warehouse in the former London docks, Brigadier Blott ordered the F.I.6 mediators, a team of ace special forces, to capture them. However, they came up against Necrom, who drained their life energy to restore himself to full power. As the esper division sense this, Necrom fries them, blowing up the warehouse and their van. Captain Bodie and Brigadier Blott struggle from the rubble, but Necrom absorbs their life energy, leaving only [[Scott Wright (Earth-616)|Micromax]] left. He managed to shrink so fast that Necrom believed he had absorbed his life energy too, and so escaped, being the sole survivor of F.I.6.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 #50}} After the death of [[Theobald Blott (Earth-616)|Inky Blott]] and most of his team at the hands of Necrom, [[F.I.6 (Earth-616)|F.I.6]] was absorbed into the [[Resources Control Executive (Earth-616)|R.C.X.]].{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 #62}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Esper Division Van\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:British Organizations]]"
