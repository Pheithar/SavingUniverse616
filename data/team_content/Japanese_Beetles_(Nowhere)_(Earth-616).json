They are the product of [[Jimmy Jankovicz (Earth-616)|Jimmy Jupiter's]] imagination. They invade the Victory Garden in order to destroy the vegetables being grown there but are constantly opposed by its defenders, swarms of crows and [[Mantis Marines (Nowhere) (Earth-616)|Mantis Marines]]. They are inspired by the [[Imperial Japan (Earth-616)|Imperial Japanese]] army.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics Vol 1 47}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each member of the Japanese Beetle army is armed with an automatic weapon.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Nowhere Races]]"
