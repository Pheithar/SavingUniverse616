They fought off any attempt from anybody at entering the island.{{r|All-New X-Men #40}}\n\nThe [[X-Men (New Charles Xavier School) (Earth-616)|X-Men]] were reached out by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to investigate the island after a recon team went missing. The X-Men teleported to the island, and initially engaged the Utopias. After talking it out and discovering the Utopians wanted nothing but to be safe and undisturbed, the X-Men offered them a place at the [[Weapon X Facility|New Charles Xavier School]], which they gladly accepted.{{r|All-New X-Men #41}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
