They were led by Dracula's son [[Xarus (Earth-616)|Xarus]], adopting the identity of the mysterious Shadow Colonel. Under their pretense of contesting Dracula's throne, the Legion of the Unliving massacred other vampires, with the objective to weed out the weakest members of the vampire race.\n\nDuring an attack on [[Castle Dracula]], the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] assisted the [[Romania|Romanians]] in the surroundings of the castle, who were threatened by fleeing vampires. The Shadow Colonel turned himself over to the Avengers and was taken to the [[Avengers Mountain]]. In addition to goading the Avengers' newest recruit, the vampire-hunter [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]], the Shadow Colonel only surrendered himself over so that [[Sarge (Hellhound) (Earth-616)|Sarge]] could infiltrate the base and take possession of the [[Roberto Reyes (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] with a demonic recitation.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 14}} With the Ghost Rider in their ranks, the Shadow Colonel and Sarge had him scold them away on his [[Hell Charger]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 15}} In the meantime, Dracula had used the attack on his castle as a pretext to seek political asylum in [[Russia]], presenting himself with a weak and feeble appearance.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 14}} He offered all his knowledge in exchange for a piece of land where he could purportedly spend his final days in peace.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 16}}\n\nThe Legion of the Unliving continued their crusade in [[Madripoor]], where they were intercepted by the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 15}} The vampires managed to escape while the heroes were occupied confronting and ultimately freeing the Ghost Rider from Sarge's influence.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 16}} The Legion of the Unliving fled to [[Russia]], where they turned all the prisoners of the [[Sol-Iletsk]] [[Federal Penal Colony No. 9]] into vampires to build up the ranks of the new kingdom. The Avengers came to stop the vampire outbreak, and Blade wounded Xarus during battle, severing his right leg and right arm before eventually decapitating him. The Legion of the Unliving escaped with Xarus' body and head, since he had remained responsive after being decapitated. Sarge was left behind, having been defeated by the Avengers' own canine ally, [[Thori (Earth-616)|Thori]]. The Legion met with Dracula in [[Chernobyl]], which was the territory the Russian government had granted him, and where he intended to set up his new domain.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 17}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
