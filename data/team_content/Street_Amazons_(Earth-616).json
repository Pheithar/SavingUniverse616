They attempted to purchase high-tech guns from Mr. Carbine and Ice, both of who were killed. Sidney Fishburne offered to supply them with battle armor, if they retrieved a time-displace equipment part that was in the possession of the Huns. Equipped with the large battle armor, the Street Amazons attacked the Huns. Once Fishburne no longer needed the Street Amazons, their battle suits disappeared making the gang fight a more even one.{{r|Killpower: The Early Years Vol 1 3}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Gangs]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
