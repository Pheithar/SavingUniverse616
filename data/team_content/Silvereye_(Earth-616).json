Sanctioned by The President\n\nThe Silvereye organization was compromised early on, perhaps since its inception by the very menace it was designed to eliminate.  There were vampires infiltrating the program from field operatives to the very Head of SilverEye, Darius Venginian.\n\nThe vampires involved with SilverEye managed to acquire and brainwash [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]] into thinking he was one of them.  Their plans for Blade failed.  However, Venginian's true agenda remains unknown.\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D.
