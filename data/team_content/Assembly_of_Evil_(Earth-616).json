The Jester contacted many second-tier criminals to form his \"Assembly of Evil,\" including the heroes [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] and [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]], whose reputation as vigilantes has often left them be mistaken for criminals.\n\nThe Assembly confronted a small contingent of [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] who were holding a press conference regarding the \"Acts of Vengeance.\" The Avengers defeated the Assembly with the help of Cloak and Dagger, who had only agreed to join the villains so they could foil their plans. The Assembly was remanded to custody and the various members have never since banded together again.{{r|Mutant Misadventures of Cloak and Dagger Vol 1 8|9}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = '''Declined Membership:'''\n* [[Typhoid Mary]]\n* [[Leader]]\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * The Unofficial Handbook to the Marvel Universe\n}}"
