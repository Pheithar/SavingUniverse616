It was involved in the drug trade, using their territory to grow the drug crops. Their number one customers were the [[Cosa Nostra (Earth-616)|American Mafia]]. F.A.R.C. invited [[Thomas Casino (Earth-616)|Tommy Casino]] down to Colombia for party. When he arrived, they took him hostage to ransom the capo.. They sent one of his fingers back to the mob and demanded $10 million, which they received. Afterwards they mailed another finger to the Mob and demanded another $10 million, but this time the family didn't pay. \n\nWith him gone, the East Coast families began to slide into chaos with unsanctioned hits, territorial infractions, and infighting. [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] rescued Tommy Casino from a guerilla camp. He shot him a dart which made him immune to the poison gas his mortar rounds delivered to the camp, which killed a hundred. F.A.R.C. guerillas chased them through the jungle, forcing the Punisher to fight his way to the aircraft that was going to take the both of them out of Colombia.{{r|Punisher Vol 6 13|14}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Helicopter gunship\n| Weapons                 = military-grade firearms and machine guns{{r|Punisher Vol 6 13|14}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Colombian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Military Personnel]]"
