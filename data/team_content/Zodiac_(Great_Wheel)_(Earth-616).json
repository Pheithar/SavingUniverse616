They all represented the nations, factions and secret societies most likely to acheive world domination and they all fought for this in the shadows. He needed certain secret missions performed, in exchange for he would provide them with patronage and resources which could be acquired nowhere else on Earth, which would give them and their factions advantage in fighting their wars in secret. All of this on the condition of ultimate anonymity for all parties. Despite personal hatred and pride, all parties agreed.{{r|Secret Warriors #25}}\n\n===Events===\nThe first mission was in [[Giza]], [[Egypt]]. Pisces, Capricorn, Leo and Aquarius were sent into a Brood nest after a power source. It ended in success.{{r|Secret Warriors #25}}\n\nThe second mission was in [[Amboise]] in the [[Loire Valley]]. Virgo, Scorpio and Gemini were sent to the grave of Leonardo da Vinci. However, they encountered something they were unprepared for and marked the mission as unsuccessful.{{r|Secret Warriors #25}}\n\nThe third mission was in the [[Zargos]] mountain range. Taurus, Sagittarius, Libra and Cancer fought their way through a horde of undead cyborgs to find a collection of stasis chambers.{{r|Secret Warriors #25}}\n\nThe prizes, brought together, were combined into something capable of sustaining an army on the power source, while turning one person into a superhuman. However, the Russian members of the Great Wheel double-crossed the others and stole everything.{{r|Secret Warriors #25}}\n\nThe Great Wheel ended up having an immense impact on the lives of its agents. Nick Fury was mortally wounded and only recovered through the [[Infinity Formula]]. [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]] and [[Shoji Soma (Earth-616)|Shoji Soma]] united their forces to strike back at the Russians, leading indirectly to the formation of the [[Leviathan (Earth-616)|Leviathan]] and [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] terrorist organizations. The contents of the Amboise Coffin was retro-engineered into the S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Life-Model Decoy]] program.{{r|Secret Warriors #25}}<!--add hickman art to gallery http://bigeasycomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/darkreignthelist-sw1L.jpg-->\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Italian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Jonathan Hickman/Creator]]\n[[Category:Alessandro Vitti/Creator]]"
