Finding Genocide worthy after reading his very soul, the Celestial was about to empower him with a Death Seed when the [[Apocalypse Twins (Earth-616)|Apocalypse Twins]] appeared. Initially curious, the Celestial's feelings towards the twin [[Homo superior|mutants]] shifted into sadness when [[Uriel (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Uriel]] used the enchanted axe [[Jarnbjorn]] to cleave wide its unbreakable hull, but only because its death would bring severe consequences to the life it had tended for so long.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 7}} Its corpse was later taken to the [[Akkaba Nebula]], where [[Eimin (Earth-616)|Eimin]] pried Death and Life Seeds from its chest to use in the creation of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)#Horsemen of Death|Horsemen of Death]].{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 9}}\n\n| Equipment               = Celestial Gardeners carry Death and Life Seeds with themselves.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
