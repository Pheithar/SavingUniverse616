After they escaped, Iron Man tracked them to [[Luchino Nefaria (Earth-616)|Count Nefaria]]'s castle and fought the villains. During the fight an ionic shock erupted from the floor, apparently killing the Squad and damaging Iron Man's armor. Iron Man recovered and defeated Nefaria but the Death Squad was not seen again.{{r|Iron Man Annual Vol 1 1999}}\n\n| Equipment               = Various equipment\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Various weaponry.\n\n| Notes                   = Nefaria wasn't the leader by employer.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/dthsq4.htm\n}}\n[[Category:Private Military Companies]]"
