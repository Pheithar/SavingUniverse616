[[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]] seems to be the oldest of the Friendless; at least two of the others regard Eternity as a father.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 #25}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = The \"Friendless\" are, in no conceivable way, a reference to the [[w:c:dc:Endless|Seven Endless]] of ''Sandman'' from DC's Vertigo imprint.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
