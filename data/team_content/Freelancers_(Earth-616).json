The Champions were distracted by the Freelancer's niceties, and were caught off guard when [[Cursed Cass (Earth-616)|Cursed Cass]] set off an explosive. While most of the Freelancers confronted the Champions, [[Panic (Earth-616)|Panic]] induced fear on the protesters and [[Hotness (Earth-616)|Hotness]] slipped away to cause a forest fire. Panic was knocked down by [[Vivian (Synthezoid) (Earth-616)|Viv]], and Cursed Cass was knocked far away by [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Hulk]].\n\nThe confrontation between the Freelancers and the Champions was abruptly interrupted when two monsters originating from the [[Leviathon Tide (Earth-616)|Leviathon Tide]] landed on the forest, knocking down Hotness in the process, and prompting both teams to work together to stop the creatures. [[Might (Earth-616)|Might]] and [[Crush (Earth-616)|Crush]] proved essential to defeat a molten creature. The Freelancers remained behind while the Champions hurried to subdue a monster that had landed on the coast, which coincidentally destroyed the drilling platform the pipeline was going to be used for, potentially leaving the Freelancers without a paycheck.{{r|Champions Vol 2 1.MU}}\n\nThe Freelancers were later hired for other jobs, including disrupting a wage protest in [[Durham (North Carolina)|Durham]], [[North Carolina (State)|North Carolina]] and displacing homeless people from a tent city in [[Los Angeles]], [[California (State)|California]]. The Freelancers invited two of the homeless people they displaced to their compound, and manipulated them into fighting each other, later using Panic's powers to have them tell the authorities that the Champions had assaulted them.{{r|Champions Vol 2 6}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]"
