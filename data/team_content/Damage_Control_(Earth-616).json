Stark and Fisk sold their stock in Damage Control: Stark because he didn't want to be associated with Fisk and Fisk because he had no confidence in Robin's ability to lead the company. Another company, Carlton Co, took control of Damage Control and tried to make Damage Control more profitable, but in the process angered a lot of employees and nearly ruined Damage Control. Ms. Hoag convinced S.H.I.E.L.D. to invest in Damage Control and they loaned her the money to buy back the company. S.H.I.E.L.D. also found out that the sale of Damage Control had been a plot by Fisk to buy back the company for cheap. During the events of Acts of Vengeance (an event Fisk helped organize), massive damage was done to the city and Fisk made a large profit when Damage Control was hired to repair the damages.{{r|Damage Control Vol 2}}\n\n[[File:Damage Control (Earth-616) from Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 3 2 001.jpg |left|thumb|The team]]\n===Civil War===\nFollowing a tragedy at [[Stamford]], [[Connecticut (State)|Connecticut]] in which the supervillain [[Robert Hunter (Earth-616)|Nitro]] leveled part of the town, including a school, during a fight against the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] hunted down the supervillain. He discovered that Damage Control's CEO [[Walter Declun (Earth-616)|Walter Declun]] had provided Nitro with [[Mutant Growth Hormone]] to enhance his powers.{{Citation}}\n\nWolverine's investigation led him to interrogate Anne Marie Hoag. She revealed that Declun and his investors had taken a controlling share of the stock after the company went public to obtain more funds. Following the Stamford disaster, Damage Control obtained the town's reconstruction contract, as well as a contract to perform the evaluation and training of registered super-humans.{{Citation}}\n\nIn his search for Declun, Wolverine engaged in a fight with Damage Control guards, who were equipped with Mandroid Armor, S.H.I.E.L.D. weaponry, Stark Enterprises technology and other weapons and equipment salvaged from superhuman fights. Wolverine defeated them with the aid of two members of the Atlantean Royal Guard, who had assisted his investigation.{{Citation}}\n\nHaving survived his confrontation with the Damage Control forces and then escaped from S.H.I.E.L.D. imprisonment, Wolverine confronted Declun, who had just been fired by Hoag, and apparently killed him. However, it later transpired that Wolverine had \"only\" stabbed Declun's eyes out, which he later had replaced with cybernetic implants.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 35}}\n\n===World War Hulk===\nAfter [[World War Hulk|Hulk's attack on New York]], Damage Control, with Anne Marie Hoag back in charge, was awarded a contract by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to clean up New York. With the help of numerous Superhero volunteers, the job went off without a hitch with only a brief issue where the [[Chrysler Building]] came to life due to alien rocks.{{r|World War Hulk Aftersmash: Damage Control Vol 1}}\n\n===Monsters Unleashed===\nAfter he and his monsters helped stop the [[Leviathon Tide (Earth-616)|Leviathons]] from destroying Earth, [[Kei Kawade (Earth-616)|Kid Kaiju]] and his monsters were placed under the protection of Damage Control. Damage Control built a facility on the artificial island [[Mu (Monster Island)|Mu]] to house Kid Kaiju, his family, and his monsters and assigned their agent [[Gloria Clark (Earth-616)|Gloria Clark]] to help manage any damage caused by Kid Kaiju's adventures.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 3 1}}\n\n===House of X===\nSometime after the establishment of the settlement of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] and [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]] broke into one of Damage Control's buildings in search of information. Due to this and Sabretooth's attacks on various guards, the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] were alerted and confronted the trio, with [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|the Invisible Woman]] capturing Sabretooth. Through an infographic, it was revealed that various inventions created by both Tony Stark and Reed Richards were now in Damage Control's possession due to events that incapacitated the two of them.{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}}\n\n==Employees==\n* [[Anne Marie Hoag (Earth-616)|Anne Marie Hoag]]: Founder and first director of Damage Control, an elderly lady, she is good friends with then-S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury and convinced him that S.H.I.E.L.D. should loan her the money to buy Damage Control's stock.

Despite both heroes going to great lengths to avoid such thing, their normal avenue of evasion consisted of leaving control of their intellectual property to each other; and this method failed after Richards was missing for a prolonged period of time and Stark fell into a coma. The rights to all of that material became contested,{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}} presumably after both heroes returned.\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D.
