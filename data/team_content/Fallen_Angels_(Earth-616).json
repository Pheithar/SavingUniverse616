He was scared to death from the mutants-hunters teams such as [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] or the [[Marauders (Earth-616)|Marauders]].{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 1 8}}\n\nAfter accidentally injuring his teammate [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]], a deeply ashamed [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]] left his own team, the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]], and ran away to the city, with his teammate [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]] accompanying him, trying to keep him from harm. They encountered Chance, who led them to the Fallen Angels, and the two were invited to join.{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 1 1}} Associates of the New Mutants, [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]] and the [[James Madrox (Fallen Angels) (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]], secretly a rogue duplicate of the main [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Jamie Madrox]], were asked to follow Sunspot, and they soon encountered and joined the group as well.{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 1 2}} Some time later, secretly following up on stories she had heard, Ariel took the group to [[Earth-78411]], where they encountered and befriended extra-dimensional mutants [[Devil Dinosaur (Earth-78411)|Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon-Boy (Earth-78411)|Moon Boy]].{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 1 4}}\n\nAnother [[James Madrox (Mutate Duplicate) (Earth-616)|Madrox Duplicate]] from the Fallen Angels' Madrox joined the team later, but refuse to rejoin the \"original\".{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 1 5}} It was revealed both by [[Mini-Cerebro]] and the fact to having not been vanished during Madrox's powers nullifying by Chance that he was a mutated duplicated, a mutation of a mutation.{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 1 6}}\n\n\nFinally, the Fallen Angels journeyed to Ariel's home planet, after [[Chance (Fallen Angels) (Earth-616)|Chance]]'s powers endangered the team, nullifying the peace-mutation of Warlock, and making the Vanisher believe he was targeted by some mutants-hunter, and allowing Ariel to teleport them, pretendly for their safety, herself unbeknownst of the source of the disturbances.{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 1 6}}\n\nThere, they were made captives. Ariel turned against her home planet's ruler Unipar when he took not only her friend Chance but also Ariel herself captive as well, since they both proved to possess superhuman mutant powers. The Fallen Angels regained their freedom and returned to Earth, but the [[James Madrox (Mutate Duplicate) (Earth-616)|mutated duplicate]] was reabsorbed by [[James Madrox (Fallen Angels) (Earth-616)|\"the real Madrox\"]].{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 1 7|8}}\n\nSunspot and Warlock returned to the New Mutants, and eventually Siryn and Multiple Man returned to their base at the [[Muir Island]] research facility. Boom Boom left to become inducted as a trainee of the original mutant team [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]]. Moon Boy and Devil returned to their homeworld, while Vanisher returned to crime. Ariel eventually resurfaced after [[M-Day]] in [[San Francisco]], while Chance's subsequent fate remains unrevealed. [[James Madrox (Fallen Angels) (Earth-616)|\"Multiple Man\"]] later allied with [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mr. Sinister]] into his [[Nasty Boys (Earth-616)|Nasty Boys]], and briefly absorbed the original [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|James Madrox]], using his adventure in the Fallen Angels to make the new [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] and even Madrox himself believe he was the original.{{r|Fallen Angels Vol 1 8}}{{r|X-Factor Annual Vol 1 8}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 75}}\n\n\n| Equipment               = [[Mini-Cerebro]]\n| Transportation          = [[Ariel (Coconut Grove) (Earth-616)|Ariel]] and [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]] (for his own purpose) teleportation powers.\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = In her plot to assemble a pool of [[Homo superior|mutant beings]], [[Ariel (Coconut Grove) (Earth-616)|Ariel]] had collected various kind of specimens:\n* [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]], [[Roberto Da Costa (Earth-616)|Sunspot]], [[Theresa Cassidy (Earth-616)|Siryn]], [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom Boom]]: Classic '''Human mutants''', or '' '''[[Homo superior]]''' ''\n** [[James Madrox (Fallen Angels) (Earth-616)|\"Multiple Man\"]], a '''[[James Madrox (Earth-616)#Powers|duplicate]]''' from [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Madrox]]\n*** An '''independent [[James Madrox (Earth-616)#Powers|duplicate]]''': [[James Madrox (Mutate Duplicate) (Earth-616)|Madrox Independent Dupe]], from a [[Homo superior#Secondary Mutation|Secondary Mutation]] or for being a [[Mutate]].\n** [[Chance (Fallen Angels) (Earth-616)|Chance]], a [[Homo superior#Latent Mutant|'''latent mutant''']].\n* [[Homo Superior#Non-Human Mutants|'''Non-Human Mutants''']]\n** A '''mutant lobster''': [[Don the Lobster (Earth-616)|Don]] (whose mutation was only a color alteration)\n** A '''mutant dinosaur''' from the past or from an alternate timeline: [[Devil Dinosaur (Earth-78411)|Devil Dinosaur]], \n** An '''ape-man mutant''' from the same origin: [[Moon-Boy (Earth-78411)|Moon Boy]] \n** A '''[[Technarchs|Technarch]] mutant''': [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]]\n** A '''[[Coconut Grove]] mutant''': [[Ariel (Coconut Grove) (Earth-616)|Ariel]], herself, first mutant of her species.\n\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
