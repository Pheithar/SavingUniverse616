They used the MK-1, MK-2 and MK-3 to commit crimes, and even though the CSA knew about this, they didn't have the resources to resolve the situation.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 103}}\n\nLater, the [[Superhuman Registration Act|SHRA]] passed, and the Thunderbolts registered in the [[Initiative]]. The CSA convinced the Thunderbolts to track down and apprehend the Beetles, and later they were taken to the Folding Castle. There, they were brainwashed with dreams promoting Thunderbolts service. The Beetles were drafted into Operation: Justice Like Lightning (an army of criminals into government service supervised and trained by the Thunderbolts, overseen by [[Dallas Riordan (Earth-616)|Dallas Riordan]] and [[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Gyrich]]). Also, they and the rest of the recruits were fitted with a subdernal phase-shift locator that teleported them to a holding facility if they disobeyed. Showing great command of the cybernetic systems, they soon apprehended super-villains like [[Roger Gocking (Earth-616)|Porcupine]] and [[Edward Lavell (Earth-616)|Eel]]. Since then, the Thunderbolts have dissolved and the Initiative has disbanded.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 103|109}}\n\n| Equipment               = <br>\n* [[Beetle Armor MK I]] (Robichaux); \n* [[Beetle Armor MK II]] (Vaughn); \n* [[Beetle Armor MK III]] (Quinn);\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
