In New York City, it was putting pressure on the [[Royal Cobras (Earth-616)|Royal Cobras]], a Vietnamese gang. In New York, they were involved in protection rackets and people smuggling.<!-- {{r|Punisher Vol 2 51}} -->\n\nThe triad brought a 30 ft golden statue of Buddha, which was stolen from Laos by the PLA and stored it in a warehouse. The [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] and his allies, the Royal Cobras, later assaulted that warehouse.{{r|Punisher Vol 2 51}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = Historically there was a White Lotus Society, which records / evidence shows to have existed as early as the 13th century (though legend states it is older than that). It organized and led a rebellion (the Red Turbans) which overthrew the foreign Yuan dynasty (Mongol), expelled the Mongols from China, and reestablished Han Chinese rule (the Ming Dynasty). \n\nAfter the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, it led a new rebellion against the foreign Qing dynasty (Manchu) at the close of the 18th century, which failed to overthrow the Manchu. Some scholars consider the White Lotus Society to be the ancestor or one of the ancestors of the Heaven and Earth Society (aka, the Triads), and it may have been one of the Triads' five branches that existed in the 18th century.\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Triads]]\n[[Category:Chinese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]"
