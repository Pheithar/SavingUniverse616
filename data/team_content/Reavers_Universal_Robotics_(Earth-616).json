HQ demanding the whereabouts of his partner [[Elsie-Dee (Earth-616)|Elsie-Dee]]. The Reavers' leader and head of R.U.R. [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]] revealed to Albert that Elsie-Dee had come to him to remove the self-destruct mechanism in her. Instead, Pierce took her apart and sold the pieces to different criminal gangs throughout Madripoor. When Pierce tried to do the same to Albert, Albert wrecked R.U.R.'s laboratory and killed some Reavers before forcing Pierce tell him who had Elsie-Dee's parts. Pierce later gathered up his men to get revenge on Albert.{{r|2020 iWolverine Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = Biological 3D printing technology\n| Transportation          = Military-style vehicles\n| Weapons                 = Electric stun weapons, cybernetics, guns\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n\n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
