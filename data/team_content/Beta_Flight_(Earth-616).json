This version was later disbanded when the Canadian government cut all funding to [[Department H (Earth-616)|Department H]] after several missions were deemed failures.\n<br> Membership consisted of:\n<center><gallery style=\"text-align:center;\">\nRoger_Bochs_(Earth-616)_from_Official_Handbook_of_the_Marvel_Universe_Vol_2_2_0001.jpg|[[Roger Bochs (Earth-616)|Box (Bochs)]]\nFile:Marrina Smallwood (Earth-616) from Alpha Flight Vol 4 3 001.jpg|[[Marrina Smallwood (Earth-616)|Marrina]]\nFile:Eugene Judd (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Force Vol 2 4 Larroca Variant Cover.jpg|[[Eugene Judd (Earth-616)|Puck]]\nGardner Monroe (Earth-616) from Alpha Flight Vol 1 12.png|[[Gardner Monroe (Earth-616)|Flashback]]\n</gallery></center>\n\nThe second team to be known as Beta Flight was created by [[Heather Hudson (Earth-616)|Heather Hudson]] after Alpha Flight became allied with several young super-humans.
