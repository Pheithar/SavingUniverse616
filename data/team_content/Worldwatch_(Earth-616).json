It was founded by Vincent Cetewayo from the African Republic of Imaya. In a Conflict with Imaya's Dictator General Eda Arul and his mysterious Advisor, Cetewayo was killed. He asked of James Rhodes to take over as Worldwatch's director.\n\nWorldwatch was founded with the Intent to remain as politically neutral as possible. War Machine's interference in Imaya put that neutrality at risk. The staff of Worldwatch didn't know that Rhodes is War Machine.\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D.-Agent Sheva Joseph was personally invited by Rhodes to join Worldwatch after she had Doubts about stopping War Machine and [[Michael Collins (Earth-616)|Deathlok]] from rescuing Cetewayo from General Arul.\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * Sheva Joseph was invited to join Worldwatch in {{cl|War Machine Vol 1 4}}.\n* Rhodes became the Director of Worldwatch in {{cl|War Machine Vol 1 5}}.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
