It consisted of various men trained to fight and equipment and possibly funding provided by a millionaire named Morgan. \n\nBetty called the group into action when she would receive a distress call from [[Luther Robinson (Earth-616)|Luther Robinson]]. Robinson and his female companion [[Lynne Harris (Earth-616)|Lynne Harris]] were virtual prisoners in [[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantis]] by the [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]] who had them both modified to breath underwater and was going to force Lynn to marry him. Betty went on a furlough of her police duties to gather the Legion, calling favors with munitions providers and Morgan to man an expedition to the Antarctic location of Atlantis.\n\nTravelling out by armed yachts, they attacked Atlantis with aircraft and ground troops armed with flamethrowers. With Namor held at bay, Betty freed Luther and Lynne and tricked Namor into following a decoy plane, allowing the Legion to escape and their mission accomplished.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics #18}}\n\nThe Legion was not gathered again since, likely its members (with the exception of Betty) were drafted into military service when America officially entered the war.\n\n| Equipment               = The Legion of Loyalists had breathing gear to allow them to breath underwater.\n| Transportation          = The Legion had access to fully armed yachts and fighter planes.\n| Weapons                 = The Legion was armed with rifles, grenades, and flame throwers.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
