Seeking revenge for the death of their leader, they planned to fight their rivals at a park. [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]] met the gang and tried to talk them, but was forced to fight several members. Defeating them, he was then introduced to the rest of the gang whom elected him leader.\n\nAfterwards the gang tried to steal guns from a store but were forced to leave because of the arrival of the police. Meeting the Golden Claws at the park at night, a gang fight began. Shang-Chi and [[Leiko Wu (Earth-616)|Leiko Wu]] tried to stop the fight, when a Joy Boy shot at the Golden Claw leader. Whose life was saved by Shang-Chi who took the bullet. Wounded, he convinced the two gangs to stop fighting and return home.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 90|91}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Gangs]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
