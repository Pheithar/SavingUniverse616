This iteration of the Masters of Evil was formed with the goal of breaking up the new West Coast Avengers team, recruiting [[M.O.D.O.K. Superior (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K]], who had recently been defeated by the West Coast Avengers, alongside [[Eleanor Bishop (Earth-616)|Eleanor Bishop]] and [[Derek Bishop (Earth-616)|Derek Bishop]], the parents of the team's leader [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]]. The group lured the Avengers to an abandoned carnival to torture the team, but were thwarted and released after [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Noh-Varr]] was revealed to have been disguised as Graviton, and Hawkeye broke the power inhibitors M.O.D.O.K had placed on her teammates.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 6}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
