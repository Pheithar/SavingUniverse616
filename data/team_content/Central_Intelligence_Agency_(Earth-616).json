C.I.A. is an executive agency and reports directly to the Director of National Intelligence, with responsibility for providing national security intelligence assessment to senior United States policymakers. Intelligence-gathering is performed by non-military commissioned civilian intelligence agents, many of whom are trained to avoid tactical situations. The C.I.A. also oversees and sometimes engages in tactical and covert activities at the request of the [[President of the United States of America|United States President]]. Often, when such field operations are organized, the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Military]] or other warfare tacticians carry these tactical operations out on behalf of the agency while the C.I.A. oversees them. [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|C.I.A. Headquarters]] is located in [[Langley]], McLean, Fairfax County, [[Virginia (State)|Virginia]], a few miles west of [[Washington, D.C.]].{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
