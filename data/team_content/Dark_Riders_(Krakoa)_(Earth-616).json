She explained that she could free him from the curse of the Man-Thing, but that it would leave the beast mindless and possibly threaten the entire world. Not willing to unleash that, Magik summoned the Dark Riders to help Ted, as the Man-Thing, fight against [[Harriet Bromes (Earth-616)|Harrower]] to regain his power and his home. The Riders successfully staved off the creatures that Harrower summoned to fight them, and watched as she ultimately was lost in the [[Nexus of All Realities]]. What became of the team afterwards is unknown.{{r|X-Men: Curse of the Man-Thing Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
