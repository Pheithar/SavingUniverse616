On the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]], they built a cannon capable of firing a ray with the frequency to control [[Earth]]'s plate tectonics with the intention to hold the Earth to ransom for money and power.<!-- {{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} -->\n\n[[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Nicholas Fury, Jr. (Earth-616)|Nick Fury Jr.]] broke into the cannon's base in order to steal the elemental compound powering the device. Numerous members of the Shogun Reapers were sent to the perimeter of the base to deal with Fury when he was detected by the cameras; however, Fury had used [[Prism Dust]] to delay the transmission, setting up a trap, and killing them in an explosion.<!-- {{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} -->\n\nThe base's leader [[Daniel Kiku (Earth-616)|Danny Fear]] and his two lieutenants confronted Fury outfitted with suits of armor, but the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent overrode [[Akihiko (Yakuza) (Earth-616)|Akihiko]]'s armor with his [[Prototype Eyepatch]], and had him fight his boss in order to distract them while he slipped away. Akihiko was then forced to fire at a window, decompressing the room, causing the three Shogun Reapers to be swallowed by the vacuum of space.<!-- {{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} -->\n\nMeanwhile, the guards protecting the housing that contained the element were killed by [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] agent [[Frankie Noble (Earth-616)|Frankie Noble]], who had used Fury's break-in as a distraction to carry out her own mission to steal the powering compound.<!-- {{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} -->\n\nA shuttle was later launched by remaining Shogun Reapers in order to retrieve Danny Fear, who remained floating in space, safe within his armor.{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}}\n| Equipment               = humanoid mecha,{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} battle suits,{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}}\n| Transportation          = shuttle spacecraft,{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} moon rovers,{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}}\n| Weapons                 = moon-based frequency cannon,{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} high-tech firearms, (comparable to Hydra or S.H.I.E.L.D.),{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} energized swords (mecha),{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Japanese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Yakuza]]"
