He then confronted the hero [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]] and offered to fix his long-lost love [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]] if he would join his team. Machine Man accepted, and they went to the panhandle of [[Texas (State)|Texas]] and reprogramed [[Sentry 459 (Earth-616)|Sentry]] and then the [[TESS-One]] robot, adding them to the team. \n\nHeavy Metal then went to [[Hydrobase]] and attacked the Avengers who dwelled there, battling the [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]], [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]], [[Monica Rambeau (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], and [[Marrina Smallwood (Earth-616)|Marrina]]. Unknown to the other members of the team, the Adaptoid was merely looking for information on the [[Cosmic Cube]]. He found the information he needed and summoned Kubik, a cosmic being that evolved from the cube. \n\nMeanwhile, the other members of the team began to lose one by one, except for Machine Man, who switched sides and joined the Avengers to fight the Adaptoid after he copied Kubiks powers and became almost omnipotent. The Adaptoid eventually lost the battle, and the androids and robots were sent to a secure location.{{Citation}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
