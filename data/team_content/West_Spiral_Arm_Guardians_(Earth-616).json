They were joined by Drax's daughter [[Heather Douglas (Earth-616)|Moondragon]].\n\nFor their first mission, the team was hired by [[Black Bunny Brigade (Earth-616)|Black Bunny Solutions]] on behalf of [[Castor Gnawbarque III (Earth-616)|Castor Gnawbarque III]] to kill [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]] and stop the sabotaging of an energy-converting machine named the [[D-Type Converter]] at the hands of the other Guardians.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 3}} Both teams clashed,{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 4}} and Gamora's team failed their missions. During the confrontation, Moondragon merged with her [[Earth-18897|Reality-18897]] [[Heather Douglas (Earth-18897)|counterpart]] and joined the other Guardians. Groot had helped prevent Rocket's assassination, and also defected to the other team.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 5}} The two members of Black Bunny Solutions, [[Blackjack O'Hare (Earth-616)|Blackjack O'Hare]] and [[Otherone (Earth-616)|Prince of Power]], remained with the team. In the aftermath of the conflict, the two teams extended a truce.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 6}}\n\nWhen the Guardians were reunited with Star-Lord, who heralded the return of the Olympians, Nova sought the help of Gamora's team, and the two Guardians teams stood their ground together agains the vengeful gods.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 11}} In the aftermath of the Olympians' defeat, Gamora's unit was folded back into the main team.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 12}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * This team is only referred to as the West Spiral Arm Guardians in the solicit for {{cl|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 3}}.
