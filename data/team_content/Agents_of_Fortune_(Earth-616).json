They were led by [[Vera Gemini (Earth-616)|Vera Gemini]], who was the daughter of a human and a demon. Eric Simon Payne, aka [[Eric Payne (Earth-616)|Devil-Slayer]], was once a member of the Agents of Fortune, but quit. He would later return to battle the organization.{{r|Marvel Spotlight Vol 1 33}} The [[Agent of Fortune (Earth-616)|Agent of Fortune]] stole the [[Amulet of Agamotto]] from [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] as a part of this plot. The [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]] succeeded in defeating them.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 58|60}}\n\nThe human members of the Cult lusted for power, but they were unwitting pawns of their leader Vera Gemini. They were offered as human sacrifice to the [[Demons]]. When they managed to summon many demons to Earth, they were brutally slain by the Demons.{{r|Defenders Vol 1 60}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n* At least two members of the cult had [[Shadow Cloaks|Shadow Cloak]]s which allowed them to teleport. \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/cultharvesteye.htm Profile of the Cult] in the Appendix to the Marvel Handbook\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/geminive.htm#Agent  Profile of the Agent] in the Appendix to the Marvel Handbook\n}}\n[[Category:Teams]]"
