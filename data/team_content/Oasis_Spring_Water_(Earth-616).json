They elaborated a ruse that involved toxic waste leak and the contamination of Sweet Medicine's only known underground spring, which diverted attention from the water pumping station in the newfound reservoir, which was also hidden within an alleged hazard zone to prevent any unwanted visitors.{{r|Occupy Avengers Vol 1 2}}\n\nWhen the [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] decided to investigate Swet Medicine's water problem, he delved into the reservation, catching the attention of the armed militia protecting the pumping station.{{r|Occupy Avengers Vol 1 1}} Hawkeye's confrontation against the militia and his subsequent apprehension together with his ally [[Red Wolf (Earth-51920)|Red Wolf]] by the hand of hired goon [[Morris Bench (Earth-616)|Hydro-Man]] caught the attention of two of the reservation's inhabitants, [[Silas Fireheart (Earth-616)|Silas]] and [[Frank Fireheart (Earth-616)|Frank Fireheart]], who followed the militia as they took the heroes to the pumping station.\n\nOasis' [[Boss (Oasis Spring Water) (Earth-616)|boss]] tried to interrogate Hawkeye and Red Wolf, but they managed to untie themselves. Red Wolf took down most of Oasis' armed militia while Hawkeye confronted Hydro-Man. The heroes were assisted Fireheart counsins, and together they finished off the militia and Hydro-Man, who was knocked out after being electrocuted by Silas. The authorities were notified, and Oasis Spring Water was dealt with accordingly.{{r|Occupy Avengers Vol 1 2}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
