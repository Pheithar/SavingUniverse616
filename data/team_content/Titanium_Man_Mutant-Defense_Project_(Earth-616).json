During a test run for the Titanium Men, General Zaslon was attacked by [[Arkady Rossovich (Earth-616)|Omega Red]]. When [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] stepped in to try to stop him, he was attacked by the Titanium Men, though he managed to defeat all five of them.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 19}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Titanium Man Armor (Modern)|Titanium Man Armor]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Russian Armed Forces (Earth-616)/Members]]\n[[Category:Russian Organizations]]"
