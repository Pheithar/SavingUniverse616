They often draw on the British superhuman community for assistance with superhuman threats. Such heroes as [[Joseph Chapman (Earth-616)|Union Jack]], [[Scott Wright (Earth-616)|Micromax]] and [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] have gone on missions for MI5 in the name of public security.{{r|Union Jack Vol 2 4}}\n\nUnion Jack, for instance, along with [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.'s]] U.K. liaison the [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Earth-616)|Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]], Israeli superheroine [[Ruth Bat-Seraph (Earth-616)|Sabra]] and the new [[Navid Hashim (Earth-616)|Arabian Knight]], was pressed into service by MI5 to stop a [[Radically Advanced Ideas in Destruction (Earth-616)|R.A.I.D.]] terrorist attack on [[London (England)|London]].{{r|Union Jack Vol 2 1}} At the conclusion of this mission, Union Jack discovered that MI5's assistant director [[Philip Gavin (Earth-616)|Philip Gavin]] had learned of R.A.I.D.'s plot some time before, but allowed it to happen anyway in order to force the organization's Director to resign, thereby ensuring his own promotion to the role of Director. Union Jack forced Gavin to come clean about his plan to the British media.{{r|Union Jack Vol 2 4}} It is unclear who the current director of the agency is.\n| Equipment               = Advanced scientific equipment\n| Transportation          = Flying cars\n| Weapons                 = Advanced and conventional firearms and weaponry\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Government Organizations]]\n[[Category:Secret Intelligence Service]]\n[[Category:British Organizations]]"
