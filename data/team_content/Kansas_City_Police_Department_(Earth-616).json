They helped cover up the operations of the [[Toews County Experimental Farm]], which was using [[Glossary:Gamma Radiation|gamma radiation]] to grow crops. After a local girl named [[Rebecca Green (Earth-616)|Rebecca Green]] wandered off into the farm, she got mutated into a disfigured monster which terrorized the town, killing three people over three days.\n\nWhen [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] traveled to this town to investigate Rebecca's disappearance, he found out the experimental farm. When he was being confronted by Rebecca's father [[Rick Green (Earth-616)|Rick]] for snooping around, having also found him holding Rebecca's hair clip, Darrell and Les approached them. They arrested Banner, and Darrell brutalized him in the process. At night, the mutated Rebecca rampaged downtown, drawn to Banner's gamma energy. In the process, she attacked Darrell, leaving him trapped under a car with an extensive gash across his torso. At his prison cell, Banner turned into the Hulk and escaped. He killed Les, who was guarding him, for his role in the cover-up. When he stumbled into the result of Rebecca's rampage, the Hulk approached Darrell and killed him as well for not warning the locals of the truth behind the experimental farm.{{r|Immortal Hulk: The Threshing Place Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
