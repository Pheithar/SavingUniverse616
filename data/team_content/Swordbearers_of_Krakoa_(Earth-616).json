Using the [[External Gate]], [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] led a group of [[Homo superior|mutants]] to Otherworld where they were almost immediately ambushed by First Horsemen of Apocalypse and [[Summoner (Arakko) (Earth-616)|Summoner]]. To end the fighting, [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Omniversal Majestrix Opal Luna Saturnyne]] offered the Horsemen and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] the opportunity to enter a [[X of Swords|tournament of champions]]. With no alternatives, both sides accepted the offer and Saturnyne magically implanted the tournament weapons and champions into the minds of [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] and [[Pestilence (First Horsemen) (Earth-616)|Pestilence]].{{r|X of Swords: Creation Vol 1 1}}\n\n[[File:Voltus Glade from X-Factor Vol 4 4 002.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] taking her place in the [[Voltus Glade]] as a Swordbearer of Krakoa]]\n\nAfter returning to Krakoa and discovering that [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]]'s death in Otherworld was permanent, Polaris constructed a casting circle in the [[Voltus Glade]] to transport the '''Swordbearers of Krakoa''' to the tournament.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 4}}\n\n[[File:Voltus Glade from Cable Vol 4 5 001.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] joining the other Swordbearers of Krakoa in the [[Voltus Glade]]]]\n\nWith only three days prepare for battle, the chosen swordbearers set out to gather their swords. [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] had to travel to [[Hell]] and enlist the aid of [[Solem (Earth-616)|Solem]] to obtain the [[Muramasa Blade]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 6}}{{r|X-Force Vol 6 13}} [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] travelled to [[Wakanda]], where she stole the [[Skybreaker (Sword)|Skybreaker]] after being told she would not be able to use it.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 13}} Already armed with their swords, [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] used her [[Soulsword]] to train [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]] and [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]].{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 13}} [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] was also called back to Krakoa from [[Peak VII|The Peak]] with [[Light of Galador|The Light of Galador]].{{r|Cable Vol 4 5}} Knowing of the prophecy, [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Brian Braddock]] unearthed the [[Sword of Might]] from its burial spot beneath the [[Braddock Lighthouse]], and after deceiving Saturyne, [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Betsy Braddock]] obtain the [[Starlight Sword]]. Together, Betsy as Captain Britain and Brian as Captain Avalon join the other swordbearers armed with the Starlight Sword and Sword of Might respectively. Despite their apparent destruction, [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] was able to regain both [[Grasscutter]] and [[Godkiller (Sword)|Godkiller]]. Finally, after recovering from injuries, Apocalypse went to the [[Apocalypse's Pyramid|Temple of the Horsemen]], where he retrieved and resembled the [[Scarab (Sword)|Scarab]].{{r|X-Men Vol 5 13}}\n\nWith their swords gathered and their champions assembled, the swordbearers of Krakoa travelled to Otherworld. While they fought valiantly in a series of  contests, they soon began to fall behind in the scores as the [[Swordbearers of Arakko (Earth-616)|Swordbearers of Arakko]] gained  the upper hand. Ahead of the penultimate challenge; a duel between Gorgon and the [[White Sword (Earth-616)|White Sword]] the Arakki side led with a score of 18-6. Declaring that Gorgon would need to face his soldiers first, the White Sword sent out waves of them to face Gorgon. Gorgon managed to kill 13 of them, whereupon Saturnyne declared that Krakoa had receieved a point for each soldier slain, giving them a one-point lead. White Sword finished a grievously wounded Gorgon off, tying the score at 19-19.{{r|Cable Vol 4 6}} \n\nThe final challenge was to be between Apocalypse and his erstwhile wife [[Genesis (Earth-616)|Genesis]], possessed by the dark elder god of Amenth; [[Annihilation (Earth-616)|Annihilation]]. Apocalypse gained the upper hand in the duel, but refused to kill his wife, prompting Annihilation to seize control of her and summon its horde of demons. Apocalypse and the other Krakoan swordbearers retreated and prepared to face the might of Amenth and the remaining Arakki swordbearers. The ensuing battle seemed doomed, but the swordbearers were reinforced by the newly reforged [[Captain Britain Corps (Multiverse)|Captain Britain Corps]], the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and the [[Vescora]], allowing them to stand against the Amenthi hordes. Apocalypse found Annihilation on the battlefield and disarmed it, ripping the Golden Helm from his wife and donning it himself. He merged with Annihilation but managed to control it and ceded the tournament on its behalf, granting Krakoa the victory.{{r|X of Swords: Destruction Vol 1 1}} \n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = <br>\n* [[Soulsword]]{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 4}}\n* [[Muramasa Blade]]{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 6}}{{r|X-Force Vol 6 13}}\n* [[Skybreaker (Sword)|Skybreaker]]{{r|Marauders Vol 1 13}}\n* [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]]{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 13}}\n* [[Light of Galador|The Light of Galador]]{{r|Cable Vol 4 5}}\n* [[Sword of Might|The Sword of Might]]{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 13}}\n* [[Starlight Sword|The Starlight Sword]]{{r|Excalibur Vol 4 13}}\n* [[Scarab (Sword)|The Scarab]]{{r|X-Men Vol 5 13}}\n* [[Grasscutter]]{{r|X-Men Vol 5 13}}\n* [[Godkiller (Sword)|Godkiller]]{{r|X-Men Vol 5 13}}\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:X of Swords]]"
