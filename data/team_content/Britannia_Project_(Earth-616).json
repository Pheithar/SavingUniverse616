During their planned first public appearance, [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]'s invasion began and Britannia was killed by a [[Symbiote Dragons|symbiote dragon]].{{r|Union Vol 1 1}} While fighting Knull's forces too, Choir was infected by a symbiote and fell under Knull's control. Her teammates' unusual physiologies however allowed them to resist Knull and devise a plan to break her free. Once that was taken care of, the trio quit the team, claiming they were only doing it for Britannia. Union Jack was then informed that, as the newly appointed leader, he had to bring them back.{{r|Union Vol 1 2}}\n\nFollowing the defeat of [[Croker Dyle (Earth-616)|Doc Croc]] and [[Steve Darwin (Earth-616)|Steve Darwin]] the team was officially disbanded but unofficially they would still protect Britain should the need arise.{{r|Union Vol 1 5}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
