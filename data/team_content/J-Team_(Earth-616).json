The roster was rounded out by [[Princess Justice (Sarah Jo) (Earth-616)|Princess Justice]], [[Mister Swift (James) (Earth-616)|Mr. Swift]], [[Little J (Bess) (Earth-616)|Little J]] and [[Marty (J-Team) (Earth-616)|Marty]]. In the early days, the J-Tem was funded by Justice's family through their chain of steakhouses.\n\nJustice and Princess Justice eventually married and they had a child named [[Matthew Caniglia (Earth-616)|Matthew]]. Tragedy struck shortly afterwards with the death of Princess Justice on a mission. Justice focused full-time on crime-fighting, but the remaining members of the J-Team retired after Mr. Swift died, resulting in the team's disbandment.\n\n[[File:J-Team (Earth-616) from Runaways Vol 5 29 001.jpg|thumb|left|The original team]]\nAlmost a decade later, Justice, having adopted the identity of \"Doc Justice,\" reformed the J-Team as a crime-fighting school. Doc Justice and his sidekick [[Kid Justice (Earth-616)|Kid Justice]] were joined by [[Jennifer Moore (Earth-616)|Blue-J]], the new [[Natalie McClure (Earth-616)|Princess Justice]], and an unidentified fifth member.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 29}}\n\nThe roster of the team kept changing throughout the years due to the death of their members, in some instances with new heroes stepping up and taking on the mantle of dead predecessors. The secret behind the J-Team's high mortality rate was due to Doc Justice routinely orchestrating the death of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to raise his own profile as part of the sensationalization of his super hero life, believing that his mediatic image and the fortune that came with it helped him protect Los Angeles.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 30}}\n\n[[File:J-Team (Earth-616) from Runaways Vol 5 29 002.jpg|thumb|left|The J-Team reformed]]\nAt one point in time, the J-Team branched into the [[J-Squad (Earth-616)|J-Squad]], and in the 1990s, Doc Justice led the unmemorable team named [[Justice for All (Earth-616)|Justice for All]].{{r|Runaways Vol 5 26}} When Matthew was a teenager, he begged his father to take him on as the second Kid Justice,{{r|Runaways Vol 5 29}} and he eventually became involved in Doc Justice's schemes to kill his teammates. Matthew's contemporaries were the third [[Jen Gaines (Earth-616)|Princess Justice]], [[Ashley Pearson (Earth-616)|SPF]], and [[James McClintock (Earth-616)|Trench]]. When Doc Justice disappeared for roughly a year, he was secretly replaced by the then-current Justice Princess.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 29}} During a staged mission called \"Operation: Clear Slate,\" Doc Justice buried Matthew's super heroic alter-ego, and he started running Mission Control for his father. In the mid-2000s, the J-Team disbanded after another tragedy.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 30}}\n\n[[File:Victor Mancha (Earth-616) and J-Team (Earth-616) from Runaways Vol 5 26 001.jpg|thumb|right|The J-Team as Victor Mancha remembered them]]\nOportunity arose for Doc Justice to reform the J-Team when the group of teenage heroes known as the [[Runaways (Earth-616)|Runaways]] sought his help after being forced out of their underground hideout by a public drainage work. [[Victor Mancha (Earth-616)|Victor Mancha]] was a big fan of the J-Team, and offered to assist Doc Justice in a mission. The rest of the Runaways followed suit, donning the costumes of past members of the J-Team as well.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 26}} After this initial mission, the Runaways were consolidated as a new J-Team.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 27}} Victor became Kid Justice, [[Chase Stein (Earth-616)|Chase Stein]] donned BumpStock's costume as \"Gun Arm,\" [[Nico Minoru (Earth-616)|Nico Minoru]] became The Gloom, [[Molly Hayes (Earth-616)|Molly Hayes]] became Blue-J, [[Karolina Dean (Earth-616)|Karolina Dean]] became Princess Justice.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 26}} and [[Gib (Earth-616)|Gib]] became Old God. Only [[Gertrude Yorkes (Earth-616)|Gert Yorkes]] was left behind, in part for her lack of combat ability and because Doc Justice didn't see her physique suitable for the media. During missions, she stayed behind with Matthew at Mission Control.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 29}}\n\n[[File:Runaways (Earth-616) and Doc Justice (Earth-616) from Runaways Vol 5 30 001.jpg|thumb|left|Doc Justice with the Runaways as the J-Team]]\nThis new J-Team enjoyed a burst in popularity, and they continued working with and being trained by Doc Justice for weeks.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 28}} However, after failing to secure a contract for a TV reality show, Doc Justice decided to kill off Karolina Dean for an attention bump. He led the J-Team into a trap for Karolina, pitching her against former J-Team member SPF, who possessed the ability to absorb solar energy.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 30}} Gert had become increasingly suspicious of the J-Team's high mortality rate,{{r|Runaways Vol 5 29}} and eventually snooped through Matthew's computer, where she discovered the truth behind it.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 30}} She rushed with her pet dinosaur [[Old Lace (Earth-TRN846)|Old Lace]] to intercept the J-Team's mission. Matthew tried to stop her, but she convinced him to help her.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 30}}\n\nGert and Matthew managed to barely stop Ashley from killing Karolina, and Doc Justice fended himself against the rest of the Runaways. When he was holding Gert at gunpoint, Victor Mancha arrived and immobilized Doc Justice long enough for Old Lace to sink her teeth on him, ending his life. Matthew tended to SPF while the Runaways left the scene.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 31}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[J-Team Costumes]]\n| Transportation          = [[Justice-UV]]\n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * All five [[Princess Justice|Princesses Justice]] were blond and three of them were married to Doc Justice, one of them being the first Princess Justice.{{r|Runaways Vol 5 29}}\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Media-Driven Teams]]"
