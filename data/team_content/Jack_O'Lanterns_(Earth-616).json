Unbeknownst to Levins, the four additional Jacks were sleeper agents working for the [[Karl Fiers (Earth-616)|Finisher]].{{r|Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: Chameleon Conspiracy Vol 1 1}} They fought against [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and [[Teresa Parker (Earth-616)|Teresa]] when they tried to capture [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]], who was selling the [[Infinity Formula|Infinity Formula]] to the Foreigner.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 32}}\n\nThe Foreigner later deployed the Jack O'Lanterns when he cornered [[Nicholas Powell (Earth-616)|Chance]] into accepting a bet to attempt to steal a [[Web-Shooters|web-shooter]] off Spider-Man. Since succeeding would make the Foreigner cover all the debts of the wagers of his casino, but he had been swindled of his money by Chance, Chance tried to fail on purpose. However, the Jack O'Lantern's intervention allowed him to fluke the challenge when one of the Jacks sliced a web-shooter off Spider-Man's wrist and it fell on Chance's hands. Afterward, Chance and the Foreigner became partners.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 40}}\n\nAfter Chance pressured one of his indebted patrons, college student and inventor [[Jamie Tolentino (Earth-616)|Jamie Tolentino]], into stealing a device called the [[Catalyst (Item)|Catalyst]] to power his own invention, a future-predicting artifact named the [[Clairvoyant (Item)|Clairvoyant]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 68}} the Jack O'Lanterns revealed themselves as double agents and attempted to steal both devices on behalf of the Finisher.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 69}} Levins helped contain the Jacks' rampage, fighting his namesakes.{{r|Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: Chameleon Conspiracy Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Jack O'Lantern's Suit]] and [[Jack O'Lantern's Platform|Platform]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
