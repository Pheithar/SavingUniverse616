Instead of worshipping the [[Bast (Earth-616)|Panther God, Bast]], the White Gorilla Cult worship the [[Ghekre (Earth-616)|Ape God, Ghekre]]. Though the cult was outlawed by the rest of Wakandan society, the religion was still practiced by the [[Jabari Tribe (Earth-616)|Jabari Tribe]].{{r|Avengers #62}}\n\n===World War II===\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[White Gorilla (WWII) (Earth-616)|White Gorilla]] burned with an intense hatred towards the [[Azzuri (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and his people. Presumably gaining his powers from a similar magical ritual as the one that empowered [[M'Baku (Earth-616)|M'Baku]] years later, the White Gorilla matched the Panther's physical prowess, but his village was no match for the advanced African country. The Gorilla held such a resentment towards Black Panther for not sharing their wealth and resources that he agreed to an alliance with the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazis]] when the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] and his forces planned to invade the country in order to take over its supply of [[Vibranium]]. He was part of a force of Nazi superhumans that invaded the [[Birnin Zana (Earth)|Wakandan capital]], attacking the [[Royal Palace of Wakanda]] before being defeated by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Black Panther/Captain America: Flags of Our Fathers #3}}\n\n===Modern Era===\n<!-- Plagiarism: Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 8 -->\nThe cult's greatest warrior, [[M'Baku (Earth-616)|M'Baku]], set to claim the throne of Wakanda while [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|T'Challa]] was away from Wakanda for several months. In disregard for the Wakandan decrees, the White Gorilla Cult was restored. M'Baku performed a ritual to gain enhanced strength by killing a rare [[White Apes|white ape]], bathing in its blood, and eating its meat.{{r|Avengers #62}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = Apparently, the Jabari worshiped two gorilla gods. before they became Jabari, the tribe worshiped summoned the god [[Ngi (Earth-616)|Ngi]] and created the Gorilla Man,<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/jabariwhitegorilla.htm Jabari at Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe]</ref>{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 3 2}} afterwards the cult of [[Ghekre (Earth-616)|Ghekre]] emerged.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #2|; [[Bast (Earth-616)|Panther God]]'s entry}}{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; The [[Vod\u016b]]'s entry}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Wakandan Cults]]\n[[Category:Earth Religions]]"
