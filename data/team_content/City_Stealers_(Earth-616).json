They were defeated by [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]] and [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]]{{r|Marvel Team-Up #28}}. However, Hercules later admitted that the story was largely exaggerated.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Armor Users]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
