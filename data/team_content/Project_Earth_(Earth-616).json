[[Robert Baldwin (Earth-616)|Speedball]]'s mother, soap opera actress (and former hippie) [[Madeline Baldwin (Earth-616)|Madeline Baldwin]], joined their cause but went missing. The [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]] went to the [[Amazon]] Rain Forest to investigate and discovered that Project Earth was planning to use their superhuman agents the Force of Nature to commit terrorist acts against developers who were deforesting the land. The groups leader [[Omar Barrenos (Earth-616)|Omar Barrenos]] had planned to kill Madelyne, frame the developers and use the outrage over the murder of a celebrity to bolster his cause.{{r|New Warriors Vol 1 9}}\n\nLater undercover Project Earth member [[Michael Shauneghann (Earth-616)|Michael Shauneghann]] (PE's military strategist) helped the New Warrior [[Namorita Prentiss (Earth-616)|Namortia]] with the villain Sea Urchin and his henchmen.{{r|New Warriors Vol 1 14}} Shaunehann and Barrenos would later try to recruit Namorita into their organization at Sea Urchin's trial.{{r|New Warriors Annual Vol 1 2}}\n\nThe [[Folding Circle (Earth-616)|Folding Circle]] attacked Project Earth at their headquarters in [[Geneva (Switzerland)|Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] to recruit their superhuman operative [[Min Li Ng (Earth-616)|Firewall]] into the Folding Circle.{{r|New Warriors Vol 1 21}}. Project Earth would later send their operatives the Force of Nature into the middle eastern country Trans-Sabal which had become involved in a civil war that was causing an environmental disaster which led to the New Warriors being drawn into the conflict. PE's operative Aqueduct murdered one of the primary aggressors in the conflict and control of the country was given to a cousin of the country's former dictator which is what the United States government wanted. {{r|New Warriors Vol 1 29}} {{r|New Warriors Vol 1 30}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = Michael Shaunehann was the group's military adviser, Sasha Yamir was their political analyst and Li Muan Ho was a venture capitalist who presumably financed much of Project Earth.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/projectearth.htm\n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
