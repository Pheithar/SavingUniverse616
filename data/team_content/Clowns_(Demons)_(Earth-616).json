Edwards, becoming a prominent photographer and ethnologist. \u00a0In this identity, the Clown demon traveled to various Indian reservations and took photographs that romanticized the slaughter of the indigenous population, to the overall detriment of indigenous culture.\u00a0 On December 21, 1925, the day of the winter solstice, [[Nathaniel Great Owl (Earth-616)|Ghost Dancer (Nathaniel Great Owl)]] followed the trail of this Clown demon to New York City.\u00a0 There, Ghost Dancer exorcized the Clown demon and returned it to the Secret Worlds for atonement.{{r|Marvel Frontier Comics Unlimited Vol 1 1}} \u00a0\n\nIn recent times, a legion of Clown demons was corrupted by a [[Manitou (Necromancer) (Earth-616)|skin-walker demon]] calling itself \u201c[[Manitou (Necromancer) (Earth-616)|Manitou]]\u201d (\u201cSpirit\u201d).\u00a0 These Clown demons served as the Manitou demon\u2019s scouts and henchmen as it attempted to usurp the power of the Ghost Dancer, but were defeated by [[James Owl (Earth-616)|James Owl]], the grandson of Nathaniel Great Owl and successor to the Ghost Dancer mantle.{{r|Dances With Demons Vol 1 4}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = As stated in the comic, the false identity of \u201cCurtis M.
