Savages were a [[Los Angeles]] street gang whose leader became filled with jealousy when he saw his girlfriend flirt with [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]] in an attempt to get him jealous. The gang ambushed him, though Shang-Chi attempted to avoid battle and move on. Armed with knives and chains they attacked him but were easily and quickly defeated. His girlfriend tried to get the gang leader to stop and was accidentally killed by him. Enraged at the loss of an innocent life, Shang-Chi knocked him out with a brutally savage kick.{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 1 6}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Gangs]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
