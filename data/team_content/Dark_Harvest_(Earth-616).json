At the time, the two kids were also under the protection of [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin]] and [[Valeria Richards (Earth-616)|Valeria Richards]] of the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 21}}\n\nThe Dark Harvest were assembled to track down Jo-Venn and N'Kalla, and they found them at the front steps of the [[4 Yancy Street]], where they combated three alies of the Fantastic Four, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Kaila (Earth-616)|Sky]] before capturing Jo-Venn. Franklin and Valeria managed to drive them away after using [[Image Inducer|image inducers]] to impersonate [[Daniel Ketch (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] and the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 22}}\n\nThe Dark Harvest then raided an [[Alchemax (Earth-616)|Alchemax]] facility to steal a neutronic wave front inducer. With it, they built an [[Omni-Wave Projector]] and forced Jo-Venn to beam memories of his people's conflict with the Skrulls into the mind of every Kree. N'Kalla tracked down Jo-Venn and attempted to free him, but was captured and paired with him to also inflict every Skrull with a similar psychic intrusion. The resulting mental attack awakened the buried enmity between the Kree and the Skrull, risking to break apart their [[Kree/Skrull Alliance (Earth-616)|Alliance]] during their war against the Cotati. Franklin, Valeria, Spider-Man and Wolverine tracked down N'Kalla in turn and confronted the Dark Harvest. Valeria and Franklin managed to make Jo-Venn and N'Kalla focus on their shared bond, changing the Omni-Wave Projector's beam into one which fueled the Alliance's bond. As soon as he noticed the Dark Harvest's failure, [[Sequoia (Earth-616)|Lord Quoi]] of the Cotati turned their plant powers against them, turning them into trees.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 23}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Omni-Wave Projector]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Based on the solicit text for {{cl|Fantastic Four Vol 6 23}}, the Dark Harvest was originally going to be called the Celestial Assassins.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
