The psionic [[Addison Falk (Earth-616)|Grey King]], the winged [[Rapture (Sister Joy) (Earth-616)|Rapture]], the elemental [[Cristal Lemieux (Earth-616)|Crux]], the superstrong [[Lee Broder (Earth-616)|Landslide]], the metallic [[Mercury (Cerebro's X-Men) (Earth-616)|Mercury]], and the destructive [[Daniel Dash (Earth-616)|Xaos]] formed his perfect team. The new \"X-Men\" attacked the real X-Men, and captured Shadowcat. She was taken to Xavier, who told her he was dying of a computer virus given to him by [[Bastion (Earth-616)|Bastion]]. Xavier asked her to reconfigure a computer system to help him.  Shadowcat quickly fixed the computer, and Xavier seemed to be \"cured\", then he ordered his \"X-Men\" to place her in cryogenic storage, so her DNA would be preserved for future study. He told her that all obsolete mutants must be \"stored\".\n\n\nShadowcat managed to escape, and she was able to find [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]], [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]], who had been searching for her. They encountered Xavier and his X-Men, who were going to destroy the government's mutant tracking satellite, regardless of the potential threat to human life once its radioactive core was breached. Wolverine's senses confirmed Shadowcat's suspicions that \"Xavier\" was an impostor.\n\nIf the satellite was launched, then Cerebro wouldn't be able to collect mutants before humans found them.  The real X-Men fought and defeated Cerebro's team, and prevented the satellite from exploding.  Cerebro escaped, and revealed that his X-Men were nano-tech lifeforms created from power and personality templates stored in Cerebro's own mutant database.  Deeming them failures, he absorbed them into his body, becoming a cybernetic monster.  But the real Charles Xavier was able to subdue Cerebro, and purge a virus from its systems, destroying the robotic body it had created.\n\n==Roster==\n*'''[[Cerebro (Founder) (Earth-616)|Cerebro]]''' - The X-Men's mutant detecting computer, given physical form when a nano-tech virus corrupted its systems.\n\n*'''[[Addison Falk (Earth-616)|Grey King]]''' - Addison Falk, a super-intelligent [[telepathy|telepath]] with the ability to psionically neutralize mutant powers, he also possessed [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] abilities to move, lift, and manipulate matter with his thoughts. When he utilized his telekinesis, he was surrounded by a corona of psychic fire in the shape of a bird (like the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]]). Grey King also wore a Phoenix-like costume and had red hair. Cerebro patterned the Grey King after the mutant power template of [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] and the personality template of [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] (who had once used the alias of Grey King){{verify source}}. \n\n*'''[[Rapture (Sister Joy) (Earth-616)|Rapture]]''' - Sister Joy, a blue-skinned nun with large dove-like wings, she could fly and was a skilled sword-fighter.  She was in love with Grey King.  Rapture had red hair and a skull charm on her costume.  She was created from the power template of [[Warren Worthington (Earth-616)|Archangel]], the appearance of [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], and the personality of [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]]{{verify source}}. .\n\n*'''[[Daniel Dash (Earth-616)|Xaos]]''' - Dan Dash, an autistic with the power to fire concentric waves of explosive plasma from his glowing red left eye.  Xaos was patterned after the powers of both [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]].\n\n*'''[[Cristal Lemieux (Earth-616)|Crux]]''' - Cristal Lemieux, a French ice skater with a cocky attitude, and had the ability to fire blasts of flame or ice.  When Crux used her powers, the right half of her body turned into fire, the left turned into ice. Crux was patterned after the powers of [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]] and [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], and the personality of [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]]{{verify source}}. \n\n*'''[[Lee Broder (Earth-616)| Landslide]]''' - Lee Broder, a Southern redneck with ape-like strength and agility.  Landslide had a white stripe in his hair.  Landslide was patterned after the powers of [[Beast]] and [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]], and the personality of [[Rogue]]{{verify source}}. \n\n*'''[[Mercury (Cerebro's X-Men) (Earth-616)|Mercury]]''' - Not to be confused with [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Cessily Kincaid]] of the ''New X-Men'', Mercury was a hitman who could turn his skin into metal and had razor-sharp claws on his fingers.  Mercury was patterned after the powers and personality of [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]{{verify source}}. \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * '''Cerebro's X-Men''' were designed by Spanish artist [[Carlos Pacheco]] but he officially drew them just once in the cover of ''Uncanny X-Men #360.'' The interior art of this issue was done by [[Chris Bachalo]].\n| Trivia                  =   * [[Carlos Pacheco]] said in the Spanish magazine ''[[X-Men]]'' that Grey King was designed after [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] and [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]], the Black King. His name is a pun between Jean's surname, Grey, and the alias of Shaw, Black King.\n* Carlos Pacheco mixed [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]] in order to create Silverface, who could mold his own body. He finally appeared like Mercury in the comics.\n* Carlos Pacheco designed Landslide mixing up [[Frederick Dukes (Earth-616)|Blob]], [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] and [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] but not [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] and he wanted to called him Fastball. Landslide acquired Sabretooth's powers because he looks very much alike.\n* [[Carlos Pacheco]] wanted to call Crux Geisher, a pun between ''geyser'' and ''geisha'', because at first she was a Japanese girl, not a French one. She was designed after [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]], [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] and [[Dominikos Petrakis (Earth-616)|Avalanche]]. Geisher was supposed to have the ability to manipulate the four elements but her look was only fire and ice like Equinox, a Marvel villain created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne]].\n* [[Carlos Pacheco]] called Xaos after ''Kaos'', the Spanish translation for [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]]; The correct spelling of ''Kaos'' is ''caos'', which means ''chaos'' in English.\n* [[Carlos Pacheco]] created Rapture mixing [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]], [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]]; Carlos first called her Spook but finally she appeared as Rapture\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Teams]]"
