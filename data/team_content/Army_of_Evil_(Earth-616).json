The real purpose of the attack was to lure out as many of America's superheroes as possible. Baron Zemo subsequently had the Army of Evil teleport away, and used the [[Darkhold]] to boost the powers of [[Marcus Daniels (Earth-616)|Blackout]] to trap half of the island in a dome of [[:Glossary:Darkforce|Darkforce]], isolating heroes on the scene from the rest of the nation.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} The Army of Evil later fought off any remaining heroes in [[Washington, D.C.]] as Hydra moved toward the capital to secure its takeover of the country.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2017 Secret Empire}}\n\nAfter Hydra took over the United States,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}} Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers decided to place the Army of Evil in stasis, being wary of what they could do if they remained free.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}} Only a few remained free, namely [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mister Hyde]],{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 2}} [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]],{{r|Secret Empire: Brave New World Vol 1 3}} and Blackout{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 34}} (who would later be killed by [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] in order to release the Darkforce dome over Manhattan).{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 8}} When a contingent of American superheroes who opposed Hydra's regime known as the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]] launched a massive offensive against Hydra in Washington DC, Baron Zemo was ordered to awaken the Army of Evil. He was stopped by [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]] before he could accomplish his task.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}} When the Hydra regime ended,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}} the Army of Evil was likely released from stasis and were either forced to disband or were arrested by the authorities.\n\n| Equipment               = Each member's respective equipment\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each member's respective weapons\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Hydra (Earth-616)/Members]]"
