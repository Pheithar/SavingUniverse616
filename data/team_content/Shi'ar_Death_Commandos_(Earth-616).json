They were all created through special experiments and are criminals to the public eye and often from enemy species. Unlike the regular [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]], they are all unique except [[Black Cloak]] who is always an exguardsman.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 5}}\n\nThey were first seen sent to eliminate the [[Grey Genome]]. They succeeded in killing all except [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Grey]] and [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] (although it's debatable how he fits into the Grey line, since his [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|mother]] was a clone of [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]]). They then attempted to destroy Rachel after she had sneaked away from the Institute, but the X-Men and one of the [[Office of National Emergency (Earth-616)|O*N*E]] sentinels arrived in time to help her.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 466|468}}\n\nDuring the War of Kings,  [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]] believed that [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Lilandra]] was murdered by the Death Commandos (it was in fact a raptor in [[Darkhawk]] armor). Gladiator hunted down [[Black Cloak (Earth-616)|Black Cloak]] and his superiors and engaged Black Cloak in combat. Black Cloak actually managed to hold his own against the enraged Gladiator and had gained the upper hand and was about to kill him when Rachel Summers arrived with the Starjammers and used her powers to explode his head, killing him in revenge.{{r|War of Kings Vol 1 3|6}}\n\nFollowing the death of Black Cloak, a [[Black Cloak II (Earth-616)|second one]] replaced him on the team. Meanwhile, [[Xandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Xandra Nermani]] was being trained to take the throne of the Shi'ar Empire and requested to see her aunt, [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]]. However, [[Sybil (Oracle) (Earth-616)|Oracle]] saw Deathbird as a threat and sent the Death Commandos to kill her and her escort, the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]]. [[Flaw (Earth-616)|Flaw]], [[Hypernova (Earth-616)|Hypernova]], and [[Offset (Earth-616)|Offset]] were all killed immediately after boarding the escort vessel by [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]] and [[Devo (Earth-616)|Devo]], [[Krait (Earth-616)|Krait]], and [[Shell (Shi'ar Death Commando) (Earth-616)|Shell]] were defeated, which led to Black Cloak ordering [[Warshot (Earth-616)|Warshot]] to destroy the ship.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 5}} They then captured the New Mutants and while Black Cloak tortured them, Deathbird ambushed them and killed both Warshot and Black Cloak.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 7}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each teammates' arsenal\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Shi'ar Organizations]]"
