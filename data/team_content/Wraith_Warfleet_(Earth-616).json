It's purpose was to conquer the [[Golden Galaxy]] and spread the evil of the Dire Wraiths beyond the [[Dark Nebula]].{{r|Rom Vol 1 48}} The Wraith fleet used both technology and sorcery in its spaceborne operations and in space combat.{{r|Rom Annual Vol 1 2}} It consisted of Wraith Battlecruisers which were the warships of the fleet and of Drakillars (bat-winged battle craft).{{r|Rom Annual Vol 1 2}}{{r|Rom Vol 1 16}}\n| History                 = During the late 18th century, a [[Galadorians|Galadorian]] trading fleet dared to enter the [[Dark Nebula]]. Where it was ambushed and laid siege to by the Dire Wraith fleet. The Dire Wraiths summoned a [[Deathwings|Deathwing]], one so colossal that the stars were blocked out. Which shattered the Galadorian defenses, filled the Galadorians with horror, and stripped the flesh from their bones.{{r|Rom Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe Wraith armada then invaded the Golden Galaxy.{{r|Rom Annual Vol 1 2}} For a month both alien worlds and the Galadorian colony worlds  were brutally attacked, as they destroyed all and showed no mercy. Numerous worlds and races were extinguished by the Wraiths.{{r|Rom Vol 1 1}}{{r|Rom Annual Vol 1 2}}{{r|Rom Vol 1 16}}{{r|Rom Vol 1 48}} When the fleet reached [[Galador]], it found it defended by a thousand Galadorians who had volunteered become cyborgs so they could defend their homeworld, the [[Spaceknights (Galadorian) (Earth-616)|Spaceknights]]. Who formed a defensive ring around their homeworld. It was a long and exhausting battle, which ended in the the defeat of the Wraith fleet and its retreat from the Galadorian sector.{{r|Rom Vol 1 1}}{{r|Rom Vol 1 13}}{{r|Rom Vol 1 48}}\n  \nThe remnants of the Wraith armada were pursued by the Spaceknights, which fought them wherever they were encountered. The Wriath fleet in turn continued its attacks on the worlds of the Golden Galaxy and on Galadorian interstellar shipping.{{r|Rom Vol 1 14}}{{r|Rom Vol 1 16}}{{r|Rom Vol 1 19}} Rom pursued them all the way to [[Wraithworld]], breaking their power and scattering the Wraith fleet and the Dire Wraiths themselves throughout the cosmos.{{r|Rom Annual Vol 1 2}}{{r|Rom Vol 1 48}}\n| Equipment               = Eldritch Energy Scanners{{r|Rom Annual Vol 1 2}}\n| Transportation          = Interstellar Battlecruisers,{{r|Rom Annual Vol 1 2}} Drakillar battle craft,{{r|Rom Vol 1 16}}\n| Weapons                 = Directed Energy Weapons (beams),{{r|Rom Vol 1 1}} Deathwings,{{r|Rom Vol 1 1}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Alien Military Forces]]\n[[Category:Interstellar Fleets]]"
