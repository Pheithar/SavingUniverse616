It possessed over 150,000 operatives, analysts, and overseers, sixteen airships, and a science division. Commanded by director [[Xian Zheng (Earth-616)|Xian Zheng]], the organization was built after the [[Infinity (Event)|invasion]] by [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]],{{r|Avengers World #7}} in which the super-powered team [[Dynasty (Earth-616)|Dynasty]] was decimated,{{r|Avengers World #13}} Feeling that they needed to be able to protect themselves, [[China]] wanted to be on the same level as [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]].
