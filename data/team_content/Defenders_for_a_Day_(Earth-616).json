They were interested in joining because of the Defenders' lack of rules and loose formation. This led to a disaster as the large group of different personalities often clashed and the poor leadership of this large group (led by long-standing Defenders [[Kyle Richmond (Earth-616)|Nighthawk]], [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] and [[Patricia Walker (Earth-616)|Hellcat]]). Their first and last mission was against a team of super-villains (Led by [[Libra (LMD) (Earth-616)|Libra]] and [[Sagittarius (LMD) (Earth-616)|Sagittarius]]) who had joined together. The villains also called themselves the [[Defenders (Villains) (Earth-616)|Defenders]], using the publicity of Dollar Bill's documentary to give the Defenders a bad name.\n\nAlthough they managed to defeat the villains, the experience proved to be so haphazard, and disorganized that all the \"Defenders for the Day\" quit.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
