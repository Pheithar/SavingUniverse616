Fury Vol 1 5}}\n\nAltough a S.S. division, the Squadron operated independently from the [[v (Earth-616)|Reich]], following only Baron Strucker's orders. They were ordered by Strucker to capture young Russian killer [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Natalia Romanova]] and to bring her in [[Madripoor]], where Strucker was going to have a meeting with the cabal of ninjas known as the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]]; they fought against [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]] and [[Ivan Petrovich Bezukhov (Earth-616)|Ivan Petrovich]], but they were defeated and ultimately killed when Logan's ally [[Seraph (Earth-616)|Seraph]] arrived and shotted them.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #268}}{{r|Wolverine: Origins #16}}\n\nMany years later Strucker, now [[Supreme Hydra|leader]] of the terrorist organization known as [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], had his ally [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]] building several advanced [[Life-Model Decoy|Life-Model Decoys]] in order to use them in his future plans.{{r|Fury #1}} Some of those LMDs were created to pose as the ''[[Gnobians]]'' an alien race that had never existed, programmed with false memories of an event that had never taken place:{{r|Fury #1}} the discovering of a Gnobian space ship in the forest of [[Gruenstadt]], a [[Germany|German]] village by Strucker and his Death's Head Squadron. According to this false history, Strucker \"helped\" the Gnobians, who gave the Baron alien powers and technology, the same he would use to built Hydra.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 3|5}}\n\nTime later, while Strucker was dead,{{r|Strange Tales #158}} his son [[Werner von Strucker (Earth-616)|Werner]], now head of Hydra, started his father's backup plan to distract his longtime adversary [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Colonel Nick Fury]] while the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] would accomplish his resurrection.{{r|Fury #1}}{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 1}}{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 20}}\n\nWerner then activated the Gnobian LMD unit known as the [[Death's Head Squadron (Earth-616)|Death's Head Squadron]], which started to capture and kill those who were near to Fury, believing themselves to be real aliens and searching vengeance for their savior, Strucker. They were defeated by Fury and some other former [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] members.{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 1|6}}\n\nLater, Fury found an hologram of Baron Strucker who explained him the whole Gnobian affair was just a distraction and that he would be resurrected soon.{{r|Fury #1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
