However, how these units ended up in the [[Earth-616]] reality is a mystery. Some 300 of these unit ended up passing through the [[Great Portal]] over the planet [[Sakaar]] some years ago and were used by [[Angmo-Asan (Earth-616)|Red King Angmo-Asan]] to win the so-called Spike War. He later used them to be his elite guard following the war.{{r|Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook #1}} The Death's Head Guard were mostly used to keep slaves in line and stop insurrections on the planet. They were soon used to battle the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] when he threatened the Red King's rule. However, the Hulk ultimately took over the kingdom after defeating the Red King.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 #92|105}} When Sakaar was seemingly destroyed, some of the remaining Death's Head Guard were taken by the Hulk and his [[Warbound (Earth-616)|Warbound]] to Earth to get revenge against the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]], whom the Hulk blamed for the destruction. The Guard were used to police an arena match between members of the Illuminati, until Earth's heroes were able to defeat the Hulk.{{r|World War Hulk #1|5}}. It is unknown if any of the Death's Head Guard that were taken to Earth survived the Hulk's war. \n\nMeanwhile, the Planet Sakaar survived, at least for a short period of time and some of the Death's Head Guard units remained on the planet. They later clashed with [[Skaar (Earth-616)|Skaar]], the son of the Hulk.{{r|Skaar: Son of Hulk #6|8}}. Presumably, any remaining Death's Head units were destroyed when Sakaar was later consumed by [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]].{{r|Son of Hulk #13}}\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
