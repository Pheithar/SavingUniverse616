When Greville attempted to control Psi-Key with a computer virus, the protosilicon mutated the virus. Paxton ordered Curtis Vogel, Katherine Petrezyn, and Delgado to his side as the virus went wild. The virus attempted to possess the mercenaries and, while Delgado and several  others were killed in the process, it succeeded in creating the Bacillicons: Byte (Vogel), Kay Petrezyn, and Purge (Paxton). The Bacillicons had Greville create a machine to track Digitek. They fought Digitek but in the end they were all destroyed.{{r|Digitek #1|4}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
