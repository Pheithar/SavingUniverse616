Each member had their own unique gift though all were experienced and hardened fighters. At an unspecified point in time, the group disbanded.\n\nAfter Canada instituted the Super-Power Registration Act, [[Thomas Greaves (Earth-616)|Cleft]] caused a disturbance in [[Moosejaw]].  When Puck saw the report at [[Department H (Toronto)|Department H]], he recruited [[Kyle Gibney (Earth-616)|Wild Child]] and [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]] to assist him.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 122}}\n\nOnce the three Alphans had Cleft under control [[Flagstone (Earth-616)|Flagstone]] and [[Depth Charge (Earth-616)|Depth Charge]] arrived.  During the ensuing battle, Puck conquered any doubts he had about his actions and ensured a victory. The Outcasts were taken into custody.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 123}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Private Military Companies]]"
