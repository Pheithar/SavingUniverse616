He deployed them to deal with a few of the clones he created that had escaped his facility.\n\nFollowing Reilly's downfall, his fellow clone, the other [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]], began to track him down. When he broke into one of Ben's old office buildings to retrieve information, Reilly sent the Kill Crew to take him down. [[Kill Crew (Earth-616)/Members#Tango (Kill Crew) (Earth-616)|Tango]] and [[Kill Crew (Earth-616)/Members#Foxtrot (Kill Crew) (Earth-616)|Foxtrot]] tried but failed to shoot him down, and Scarlet Spider escaped. However, [[Kill Crew (Earth-616)/Members#Victor (Kill Crew) (Earth-616)|Victor]] and [[Kill Crew (Earth-616)/Members#Whiskey (Kill Crew) (Earth-616)|Whiskey]] were waiting for him to return to a wherehouse were he had had [[Rita Clarkson (Earth-616)|Rita Clarkson]] kidnapped.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 3}}\n\nWhen Scarlet Spider returned to the warehouse and noticed Clarkson was gone, Victor launched a missile from a rooftop nearby which exploded the building. However, Scarlet Spider escaped in the nick of time and attacked the mercenaries by surprise. After easily taking them down, Scarlet Spider threated them not to cross his path again.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider Vol 1 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]"
