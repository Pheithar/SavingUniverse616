They fought [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]] on Isla De La Sombra, off the coast of [[Morocco]]. The Twelve Horrors were sent by the Murderous Lion to kill anyone else who was seeking the [[Dreaming Maiden (Earth-616)|Dreaming Maiden]]. They were defeated, with some of them slain by the two.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 314}} On one of the worlds that the two visited through the [[Valley of Gates]], they fought and defeated the Twelve Horrors again.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 315}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Martial Arts]]\n[[Category:Demonic Form]]\n[[Category:Cthulhu Mythos Pastiches]]\n[[Category:Assassins]]"
