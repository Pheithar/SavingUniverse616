Vol 1 1\n\n| HistoryText             = \n===Origins===\nSeveral years ago, [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum-Dum Dugan]] successfully petitioned [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] director [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] to create a specialized unit dedicated to the use of paranormal personnel. Dubbed the Howling Commandos in homage to the [[Howling Commandos (WWII) (Earth-616)|famed World War II squad]], the team set up shop at [[Area 13]] and began acquiring operatives whose strengths and powers were supernatural, paranormal or extra-terrestrial in nature.{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #1}}\n\nCaptured beings were given the option to either work as an operative with the Commandos, which came with certain \"walking around\" privileges, or to be kept in continuous isolated containment at Area 13. While the Commandos' roster often fluctuated to meet the needs of the mission, a core group of operatives soon emerged: [[Nina Price (Earth-616)|Nina Price]], the [[Kenneth Hale (Earth-616)|Gorilla-Man]], the [[N'Kantu (Earth-616)|Living Mummy]], [[Frankenstein's Monster (Clone) (Earth-616)|Frank]], the [[Zombie (Howling Commandos) (Earth-616)|Zombie]], and field commander{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Horror 2005 Vol 1 1}} [[Vic Marcus (Earth-616)|Vic Marcus]], codename Warwolf. Additionally, the team outfitted the monstrous [[Grogg (Earth-616)|Grogg]] with advanced technology that allowed the dragon to serve as a living transportation vehicle, piloted by S.H.I.E.L.D. operative [[Buzz McMahon (Earth-616)|\"Buzz\" McMahon]]. This team, under the leadership of Dugan and his second-in-command [[Bradley Beemer (Earth-616)|Bradley Beemer]], completed many missions for S.H.I.E.L.D., utilizing the \"horror, shock and awe\" of their unique operatives.{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #1}}\n\n===New Leadership & Fighting Merlin===\nSome time after their formation, the group travelled to Afghanistan and defeated an unnamed group of terrorists and members of technological death-cult the [[Lords of the Living Lightning (Earth-616)|Lords of the Living Lightning]].{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #1}} After the mission, Dum-Dum Dugan was replaced as commanding officer by [[Clay Quartermain (Earth-616)|Clay Quartermain]], who made a less than stellar impression with the operatives.{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #2}} \n\nThe commando's first mission under Quatermain's command was a standard capture operation of alien creature [[Groot (Earth-616)|Groot]]; the team also acquired operative [[Joseph Timms (Earth-616)|Glob]] the same day.{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #2}} Around the same time, ancient wizard [[Merlyn (Otherworld)|Merlin]] broke free from S.H.I.E.L.D. containment and set off an enchantment that sent England into the Dark Ages{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #1}} while collaborating with [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]] (who unbeknownst to the operatives was deep undercover) and the remaining leadership of the Lords of the Living Lightning.{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #3}}{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #4}} Operatives [[Nina Price (Earth-616)|Nina Price]], the Vampire by Night, and [[Lilith Drake (Earth-616)|Lilith Drake]] were sent in undercover to spy on Merlin's activities.{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #3}}\n\nMerlin soon attacked Area 13, unleashing an army of mythical creatures into the base.{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #4}} With the active operatives overpowered and the base overrun, Beemer activated the \"stampede protocol\", unleashing all of the contained assets of the base, effectively turning the tide of the fight.{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #5}}\n\nWhile the Commandos made preparations to infiltrate Merlin's camp, Lilith attempted to double cross him, but failed and was burned alive. Quartermain then called in a favor to the [[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Mole Man]] to use his city-moving technology. As the Mole Man raised the city above the surrounding landscape and the Commandos launched their attack, Warwolf and Gorilla-Man cornered Merlin, only for the wizard to teleport away. After the battle, it was revealed to the Commandos that Lilith survived, and that her role in the mission was to assassinate Merlin, should capture not be an option.{{r|Nick Fury's Howling Commandos #6}}\n\nThe subsequent activities of the team were not recorded.\n\n===S.T.A.K.E.===\nSome years later, the Howling Commandos fell under the jurisdiction of [[Special Threat Assessment for Known Extranormalities (Earth-616)|S.T.A.K.E.]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s newest subsidiary to contain supernatural threats. A new lineup of Howling Commandos was formed, consisting of [[Hit-Monkey (Earth-616)|Hit-Monkey]], [[Manphibian (Earth-616)|Manphibian]], [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]], [[Jamie Carlson (Earth-616)|Teen Abomination]], [[Orrgo (Earth-616)|Orrgo]], an undead [[Jasper Sitwell (Earth-616)|Jasper Sitwell]], and a returning Nina Price. Dum-Dum Dugan returned to serve as the new group's field commander, while S.T.A.K.E. agent [[Martin Reyna (Earth-616)|Warwolf (Martin Reyna)]] served as the team's handler and commanding officer.{{r|Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe new team's first mission saw them securing the [[Earth Idol of Golthana]] from a tanker ship after it mutated the crew into mindless humanoid plant creatures. While successfully defeating the crew, they failed their main objective when Man-Thing's destruction of the creatures caused the idol to incinerate.{{r|Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 1}}\n\nAt the time when [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] took over S.H.I.E.L.D. and most of the United States, the Howling Commandos alongside S.T.A.K.E. fell under Hydra's control.{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = formerly [[Grogg (Earth-616)|Grogg]]\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D.
