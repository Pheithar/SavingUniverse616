They fight for the people of the [[Russian Federation]] and their interests around the globe. The team is formed from members of the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers (Earth-616)|Soviet Super-Soldiers]] after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the end of the [[Cold War (Event)|Cold War]].{{r|Soviet Super Soldiers Vol 1 1}} \n\n===The Waterwind Incident===\nWhen the Russia-based terrorist group [[Combine (Earth-616)|Peace Corpse]] seized control of the British submarine, the Waterwind, the Protectorate was sent to intervene. They encountered the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and claimed responsibility for handling the matter. {{r|Avengers Vol 1 319}} The two teams settled their differences in order to fend off an attack by [[Tyrak (Earth-616)|Tyrak]] and other [[Homo Mermanus|Atlanteans]].{{r|Avengers Vol 1 320}}\n\nWhen the Waterwind moved into Canadian waters, the Protectorate were somewhat hasty about letting [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] take control of the situation, as they doubted their experience. {{r|Avengers Vol 1 321}}\n\nA nuclear explosion did take place accidentally due to the actions of Vostok and the Vision.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 322}} [[Michael Twoyoungmen (Earth-616)|Shaman]] was able to shunt the entire area affected by the explosion into his pouch. While lost in the otherdimensional worlds contained in Shaman's pouch, Alpha Flight, the Avengers and the People's Protectorate faced the Combine; an amalgamous being of the two leaders of the terrorist group who wanted to create war on earth to promote financial growth. The Combine was eventually won over when the other terrorists joined it and all that was affected by the explosion was returned to earth, leaving the Combine to explore the various dimensions in Shaman's pouch.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 323}}\n===The Winter Guard===\nThe Protectorate later merged with [[Siberforce (Earth-616)|Siberforce]] to become the [[Winter Guard (Earth-616)|Winter Guard]].{{r|Hulk: Winter Guard Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = The Protectorate had access to Russia's military resources.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = Chronologically, their first appearance as the People's Protectorate was in [[Avengers Vol 1 319|Avengers #319]], but their origin was told later. This has lead to some discrepancies; \n* Crimson Dynamo was never a member of the People's Protectorate - he would be known as Airstrike\n* Perun's outfit was revised when they became the People's Protectorate.\nThis could be explained fairly easily by saying that the team was re-named prior to [[Soviet Super Soldiers Vol 1 1|the Soviet Super Soldiers special]] (thus explaining the new name in their [[Avengers Vol 1|Avengers]] appearances) but that the other changes had not yet been implemented.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:KGB Projects]]"
