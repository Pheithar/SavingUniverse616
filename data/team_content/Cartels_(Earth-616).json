Though other criminal organizations have been for all intents and purposes cartels (e.g. the [[Triads (Earth-616)|Triads]], the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]], the [[Yakuza (Earth-616)|Yakuza]], and the [[Molina (Earth-616)|Molina]], and likewise some terrorist groups like [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] and the [[Sons of the Serpent (Earth-616)|Sons of the Serpent]]), the criminal organizations which have been given the name \"Cartels\" by law enforcement, the media, and the underworld have been those of Latin America. Every one of the \"Cartels\" have been heavily involved in the drug trade, with some cartels having been involved only in drugs and other cartels (e.g. [[Lobo Cartel (Earth-616)|Lobo Cartel]] and [[Dos Soles Cartel (Earth-616)|Dos Soles Cartel]]) having been involved in other criminal enterprises. These syndicates were named after the city they were founded in or based in, the drug kingpin running the syndicate, the family (e.g. Lobos) controlling the syndicate, or some other symbol (e.g [[Black Knife Cartel (Earth-616)|Black Knife Cartel]]).{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 143}}{{r|Punisher Vol 10 4|6}}{{r|Punisher Vol 10 10|12}}{{r|Bullseye Vol 1 1|4}} \n\nThe oldest and most powerful one, [[Tarantula's Organization (Earth-616)|Tarantula's Organization]], had ruled [[Argentina]] for a thousand years.{{r|Daredevil Blood of the Tarantula Vol 1 1}} Which had fanatical operatives, willing to die for their master, including committing ritual suicide for failing.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 421}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 423}} Two of the cartels had a theme, where their members dressed and/or acted a specific way, following the example of their cartel bosses. In the [[Don of the Dead's Cartel (Earth-616)|cartel]] that was led by [[Don of the Dead (Earth-616)|Don of the Dead]] (an insane drug lord), the men dressed in costumes and masks that corresponded to the Santa Muerte cult (Our Lady of the Holy Death) or to Lucha Libre (Mexican professional wrestling).{{r|Taskmaster Vol 2 2}}{{r|Deadpool vs. The Punisher Vol 1 2}}{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist Vol 2 1}} In the [[Man-Dogs (Earth-616)|Man-Dogs]], it was led by [[Pit Bull (Earth-616)|Pit Bull]] a brutal humanoid dog and the organization's members wore spiked dog collars, barked, and filed their teeth.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 8}}\n\nAs the Mexican and South American Cartels have been the primary supplier of drugs to the [[United States of America]], among foreign organized crime groups it has been the cartels which have had the most numerous confrontations with American vigilantes and super heroes. Most notoriously the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]], but also including [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]], [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], and [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]].{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 143}}{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 54|55}}{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 22|24}}{{r|Punisher Vol 10 4|6}}{{r|Punisher Vol 10 10|12}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 8|11}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Presents: Anti-Venom - New Ways To Live Vol 1 1|3}}{{r|Moon Knight Vol 5 26|30}}{{r|Deadpool Team-Up Vol 2 898}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 8}}{{r|Daredevil: Reborn Vol 1 3|4}} Among organized crime groups, only the cartels have received the full paramilitary treatment by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], with two military-style assaults (complete with [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]]) on two different cartels ([[Black Knife Cartel (Earth-616)|Black Knife Cartel]] and [[Espumar (Earth-616)|Espumar's cartel]]).{{r|Bullseye Vol 1 1|4}}{{r|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 20}} \n\nThe [[Dos Soles Cartel (Earth-616)|Dos Soles Cartel]] of Mexico had an alliance with a conspiracy within the highest levels of the [[United States Government (Earth-616)|American government]].{{r|Punisher Vol 10 16}} In Colombia, the [[Cuchillo Cartel (Earth-616)|Cuchillo Cartel]] had a partnership with one of the largest and most powerful corporations in the world, [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon Energy]].{{r|Onslaught Unleashed Vol 1 2}} [[Tarantula's Organization (Earth-616)|Tarantula's Organization]] worked with the U.S. Department of Defense and Roxxon Energy.{{r|Spider-Man Unlimited Vol 1 22}} These cartels all possessed extreme influence in their home countries, being nearly untouchable due to the corruption and/or violence used by the cartels, the [[Black Knife Cartel (Earth-616)|Black Knife Cartel]] and the [[Man-Dogs (Earth-616)|Man-Dogs]] being the most extreme examples in the violence used.{{r|Bullseye Vol 1 1|4}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 3 8}} The Dos Soles Cartel also had a relationship with [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] which supplied it with superhumans.{{r|Punisher Vol 10 2}}{{r|Punisher Vol 10 4|6}} Some of the drug lords (e.g. [[Calavera de Jade (Earth-616)|Calavera de Jade]]) had relationships with the American [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|C.I.A.]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 3.1}} Within the United States, the Dos Soles Cartel temporarily united the street gangs under its banner, giving them an army of hundreds of thousands of gang members on American streets.{{r|Deadpool Vol 6 3.1}}{{r|Punisher Vol 10 5}}{{r|Punisher Vol 10 11|12}}{{r|Punisher Vol 10 14}} Unlike with the Triads, Molina, Yakuza, or Maggia there have not been any \"boss of bosses\" or equivalent who leads the cartels of Latin America (neither Western Hemisphere-wide or national-level).\n\n===Cartel Groups===\n* [[Dos Soles Cartel (Earth-616)|Dos Soles Cartel]] (Mexican)\n* [[Quintas (Earth-616)|Quintas Cartel]]

the Marvel Universe, where the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] (its analog of the American Mafia) dominates the American underworld, in the real world it's the Mexican Cartels who have the most influence in the American underworld, from the U.S.-Mexico border to the U.S.-Canadian border and from the West Coast to the East Coast. They dominate the drug markets throughout the nation and their affiliates dominate the arms trafficking, organized auto theft, and human smuggling in the American Southwest. Mexican Cartels work with Latino and white prison gangs, Latino and black street gangs, and white biker gangs to smuggle and distribute drugs. Especially the Chicano prison gangs of California, Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico (who have the most extensive and strongest relations with the cartels). These Chicano prison gangs now dominate or control the mid-level drug trafficking in California, Texas, and the Southwest, are involved in various border smuggling activities (drugs, cars, guns, and people), dominate the prisons of that region, and control most of the Latino street gangs on both the West Coast and the Southwest.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41576.pdf|title=Mexico: Organized Crime and Drug Trafficking Organizations|work=Congressional Research Service|first=June|last=S.
