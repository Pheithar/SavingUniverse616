The strength augmenting process was tremendously risky, with half the subjects dying or becoming severely deformed, but this information was kept a closely guarded secret. Power Broker and Malus also used highly addictive drugs on their subjects, telling them that the chemical was necessary to stabilize their powers, but in fact it only served to keep the subjects working for-- and paying --the Power Broker. One such victim was [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|Sharon Ventura]], who was also sexually abused while drugged. Many wrestlers of the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]], which is only open to those with super-strength, have used the Power Broker's services, and wound up indebted to them.\n\nPower Broker was also responsible for the strength augmentation of the [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|U.S. Agent]] and [[Lemar Hoskins (Earth-616)|Battlestar]].\n\nWhen Power Broker, Inc. was attacked by the vigilante known as the [[Scourge (Delazny) (Earth-616)|Scourge of the Underworld]], Curtiss Jackson exposed himself to his own augmentation device in an attempt to gain the super-strength necessary for his self-defense. The process went awry, leaving him so grotesquely muscle-bound that he could not move. Malus decided to take advantage of this situation by sending [[Priscilla Lyons (Earth-616)|Vagabond]], who knew Jackson (having previously approached him about gaining super-strength herself), to obtain a copy of his fingerprints so that Malus could access all of Jackson's personal accounts and vaults. He used an explosive wristband to force Vagabond's cooperation, but she managed to knock Malus out, destroy the fingerprint mold, place the band on his wrist, and inject him with the drug he had planned to use on her.\n\nThe Power Broker had Malus' legs broken for his betrayal, then promptly re-hired him to try to cure Jackson's condition. Malus captured and experimented on several augmented individuals, including Battlestar, which drew the involvement of the U.S. Agent. Together, Battlestar and the Agent freed the captured wrestlers, and forced Malus to restore their strength. The U.S. Agent then destroyed Malus' equipment and records.\n\nPower Broker has been responsible for providing augmented henchmen to various criminal organizations, such as the Sweatshop and the [[Power Tools (Earth-616)|Power Tools]].\n\n===Power Broker II===\nA new [[Power Broker (Power Broker, Inc.) (Earth-616)|Power Broker]] has recently appeared as the latest owner of Power Broker, Inc.<ref>Avengers: The Initiative Annual #1</ref> Very little is known about him, other then he wears a battle suit, and can project bolts of energy from his hands. He was responsible for giving [[Roger Brokeridge (Earth-616)|Hardball]] his powers.\n\nPower Broker Inc. later established the [[Hench App]].{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 1}}\n\n==Clients of Power Broker Inc.==\n* [[Roberto Velasquez (Earth-616)|Bantam]] (Roberto Velasquez)\n* [[Lemar Hoskins (Earth-616)|Battlestar]] (Lemar Hoskins)\n* [[Character Index/C#Cruz|Cruz]]\n* [[Curtiss Jackson  (Earth-616)|Curtiss Jackson]]\n* [[Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616)|Demolition-Man]] (Dennis Dunphy)\n* [[Grapplers (Earth-616)|Grapplers]]\n** [[Anita Ehren (Earth-616)|Battleaxe]] (Anita Ehren)\n** [[Deborah Lowry (Earth-616)|Cowgirl]] (Deborah Lowry)\n** [[Robin Braxton (Earth-616)|Gladiatrix]] (Robin Braxton)\n** [[Hellen Feliciano (Earth-616)|Letha]] (Hellen Feliciano)\n** [[Sandy Stalmaster (Earth-616)|Magilla]] (Sandy Stalmaster)\n** [[Marian Pouncy (Earth-616)|Poundcakes]] (Marian Pouncy)\n** [[Melissa Gold (Earth-616)|Screaming Mimi]] (Melissa Gold)\n** [[Susan Hayakawa (Earth-616)|Sushi]] (Susan Hayakawa)\n** [[Davida DeVito (Earth-616)|Titania]] (Davida DeVito)\n* [[Rico Lazar (Earth-616)|Hammerhand]] (Rico Lazar)\n* [[Roger Brokeridge (Earth-616)|Hardball]] (Roger Brokeridge)\n* [[Paul Brokeridge (Earth-616)|Paul Brokeridge]]\n* [[Power Tools (Earth-616)|Power Tools]]\n** [[Buzzsaw (Power Tools) (Earth-616)|Buzzsaw]]\n** [[Drill (Power Tools) (Earth-616)|Drill]]\n** [[Handsaw (Power Tools) (Earth-616)|Handsaw]]\n** [[Jackhammer (Earth-616)|Jackhammer]]\n** [[Pick Axe (Power Tools) (Earth-616)|Pick Axe]]\n** [[Triphammer (Power Tools) (Earth-616)|Triphammer]]\n** [[Vice (Power Tools) (Earth-616)|Vice]]\n* [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|Sharon Ventura]]\n* [[Sweat Shop (Earth-616)|Sweat Shop]] \n* [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|U.S. Agent]] (John Walker)\n* [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]]\n** [[Antonio Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Armadillo]]\n** [[Winslow Smith (Earth-616)|Blacksmith]]\n** [[Hector Lennox (Earth-616)|Hector Lennox]]\n** [[Brendon Clark (Earth-616)|Icepick]]\n** [[Jerome Johnson (Earth-616)|Jerome Johnson]]\n** [[Don Remming (Earth-616)|Jersey Devil]]\n** [[Kyle Arneson (Earth-616)|Kid Stuff]]\n** [[John Lewandow (Earth-616)|Little John]]\n** [[Red Zeppelin (Earth-616)|Red Zeppelin]]\n** [[Jonothon Burrows (Earth-616)|Sawbones]] \n** [[Michael O'Toole (Earth-616)|Steamroller]]\n* [[Priscilla Lyons (Earth-616)|Vagabond]] (Priscilla Lyons)\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Roger McKenzie/Creator]]\n[[Category:Roger Stern/Creator]]\n[[Category:Sal Buscema/Creator]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]"
