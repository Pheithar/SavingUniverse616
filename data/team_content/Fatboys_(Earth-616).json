[[Butch (Fatboys) (Earth-616)|Butch]], [[Darla (Fatboys) (Earth-616)|Darla]] and [[Straight Arrow (Alfie) (Earth-616)|Alfie]], originally known as the [[Bratpack (Earth-616)|Bratpack]], befriended [[Longshot (Mojoverse)|Longshot]], earning the wrath of his nemesis, [[Mojo (Mojoverse)|Mojo]]. The otherdimensional dictator briefly mutated the three youngsters into his agents: Snitch (Butch), Jubilee (Darla) and Straight Arrow (Alfie). The were rescued by the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]], [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] and [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]] and returned to normal. Butch, Darla, [[Eightball (Fatboys) (Earth-616)|Eightball]] and [[Ralf (Fatboys) (Earth-616)|Ralf]] befriended Matt Murdock and [[Karen Page (Earth-616)|Karen Page]] as the pair was setting up a free law clinic in their neighborhood. The Fatboys also became fans of [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], and they often tried to emulate his heroic deeds. Usually, this behavior led Daredevil to lecture them on the dangers of being a hero. The Fatboys later attended Page's funeral\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Skateboards\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
