During this period, a number of new members were added and the older members adopted new aliases. The team were drawn into a trap by the then Captain America, [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|John Walker]], his partner [[Lemar Hoskins (Earth-616)|Battlestar]] and the government mutant super team [[Freedom Force (Earth-616)|Freedom Force]]. Walker took down the team with extreme violence. \n\nThe team apparently disbanded and the Mutant Force members went back to their original identities.{{r|New Warriors Vol 2 6}} \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/resistants.htm Marvel Appendix entry]\n}}"
