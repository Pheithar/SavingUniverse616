Most of the members believed they had joined a criminal gang, but the Shroud secretly guided the group of misfit superhumans to prey on other criminals.\n| PlaceOfFormation        = Los Angeles, California\n| PlaceOfDissolution      = Los Angeles, California\n| Creators                = Mark Gruenwald; Tom Morgan\n| First                   = Captain America Vol 1 330\n| Last                    = \n\n| Quotation               = They are '''mercenaries.'''

The Locksmith was eventually captured when the original [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]] led a mass escape from the Locksmith's prison. Soon after, the vigilante [[Maximillian Coleridge (Earth-616)|Shroud]] - posing as a crime boss - recruited several of the Locksmith's former prisoners to serve as a criminal front for his vigilante activities. These early Night Shift members included [[Sybil Dvorak (Earth-616)|Gypsy Moth]] and the Shroud's one-time foe, [[Dansen Macabre (Earth-616)|Dansen Macabre]]. Shroud bolstered the Night Shift with the Locksmith's assistant, the future-predicting [[Tick Tock (Earth-616)|Tick Tock]], and several other misfits. With his group assembled, the Shroud established several bases and safe-houses throughout Los Angeles, including the \"[[Tower of Shadows]].\"{{r|Captain America Vol 1 330}}\n\nAlthough the Shroud claimed to be a crime lord, he actually sought to infiltrate the criminal underworld and destroy it from within. Thus, the Shroud manipulated the Night Shift members into battling other criminals and criminal organizations, stealing their wealth and splitting it among the team. The Shroud also kept careful watch over his team, ensuring that none of the group members preyed on the innocent. Under the Shroud's leadership, the Night Shift even allied with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] against the [[Curtiss Jackson (Earth-616)|Power Broker]]. During this time, Shroud only revealed his true plans to [[Jack Russell (Earth-616)|Jack Russell]], whose violent werewolf persona was kept in check by Dansen Macabre's powers.{{r|Captain America Vol 1 331}}\n\nDansen Macabre eventually became the Night Shift's deputy leader, overseeing the group's criminal activities whenever the Shroud was absent. During one of these periods, Dansen Macabre led an attack on the [[Avengers West Coast (Earth-616)|West Coast Avengers]] as revenge for the capture of their teammate, [[Roderick Krupp (Earth-616)|Digger]].{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 40}}{{r|Solo Avengers Vol 1 3}}\n\nThe Shroud and Werewolf departed the Night Shift, leading to them being taken over by the villainous [[Jason Roland (Earth-616)|Hangman]]. The Hangman was a supernatural servant of the demon [[Satannish (Earth-616)|Satannish]] and tricked the Night Shift members into exchanging their souls for increased powers and a promise of Hollywood stardom. While serving Satannish and the Hangman, the group again came into conflict with the West Coast Avengers. However, once the Night Shift members learned that their souls were threatened, they joined forces with [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] and the West Coast Avengers to defeat Satannish and his servant. In the aftermath of this battle, the Night Shift lost their enhanced powers and were taken into custody by the Avengers.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #76|79}} As a result, Hangman severed his ties with the group, and joined Satannish's [[Lethal Legion (Satannish) (Earth-616)|Lethal Legion]].{{r|Avengers: West Coast #98}} At some point, Gypsy Moth and the Brothers Grimm also left the team to resume their own individual careers.\n\n[[Sheoke Sanada (Earth-616)|Snapdragon]] hired the Night Shift to take out [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]], who had recently moved to [[Los Angeles]]. After they failed to take out Moon Knight and [[Maya Lopez (Earth-616)|Echo]], the [[Luchino Nefaria (Earth-616)|L.A. Kingpin]] killed them.{{r|Moon Knight Vol 6 3|6}}\n\nA new version of the Night Shift formed some time later with original members [[Percy & Barton Grimes|Brothers Grimm]], [[Dansen Macabre (Earth-616)|Dansen Macabre]], [[Roderick Krupp (Earth-616)|Digger]], and [[Sybil Dvorak (Earth-616)|Gypsy Moth]], with new member [[Waxman (Earth-616)|Waxman]] rounding out its roster.{{r|Superior Octopus Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Spider-Geddon participants]]"
