Currently headquartered in its [[Manhattan]] [[Stark Industries Main Campus|offices]],{{r|Invincible Iron Man #594}} the company's current President and Chief Executive Officer is [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]],{{r|Invincible Iron Man #600}} direct descendant of the founder [[Isaac Stark, Sr. (Earth-616)|Isaac Stark Sr.]]{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 5}}\n| History                 = \n===19th Century===\nThe company's origins date back to the 19th Century, when [[Isaac Stark, Sr. (Earth-616)|Dr. Isaac Stark Sr.]] turned his manufacturing and engineering concern into a global industrial superpower, developing new technologies that helped to redefine innovative security measures for the industrial age.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 5}} After Isaac Stark's death, the company passed through several hands, including his son [[Isaac Stark, Jr. (Earth-616)|Isaac Stark, Jr.]] and grandson [[Howard Stark, Sr. (Earth-616)|Howard Stark, Sr.]]{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 10}}{{r|All-New Iron Manual #1}}\n\n===20th Century===\nStark Industries gained growing prosperity under the leadership of Howard Stark Senior's son, [[Howard Stark (Earth-616)|Howard Stark, Jr.]],{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 5}} who had obtained full control of the company after his brother, [[Edward Stark (Earth-616)|Edward]], had sold his shares.{{r|All-New Iron Manual #1}} Appointed President of Stark Industries,{{r|Iron Man: The Iron Age #1}} Howard Stark successfully turned the company into the world leader in munitions development, while also branching out into several other scientific fields, including aeronautics, robotics, micro-technology and fringe science; since that, Stark Industries had its [[Stark Enterprises Main Plant|corporate offices]] in the portion of [[New York City]]'s [[Queens]] province located in [[Long Island]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 5}}\n\n[[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] was an initial investors in Stark Industries. The original investment was $100,000, but now when the size of the investment was calculated, a second line of zeroes was required.{{r|Hercules: Fall of an Avenger #1}}\n\nIn 1965,{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 3 9|; [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum-Dum Dugan]]'s story}} Howard Stark helped founding a global espionage agency named [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], with Stark Industries providing weapons, munitions, technology and vehicles, including the agency's mobile headquarters, known as the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]].{{r|Original Sin Annual #1}}\n\nHoward relied upon the genius of his adopted son, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Anthony]], for many of the company's advancements, even appointing him Vice President of Development. Tony, however, demonstrated little interest in Stark Industries' day-to-day management, and industrial rival [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Republic Oil & Gas Company]], in order to have Tony selling them his shares, arranged for the death of Howard and [[Maria Stark (Earth-616)|Maria Stark]] in a car accident. Tony, sole heir to his father's assets, was promoted to President, taking full control of Stark Industries and refusing Republic Oil's selling offer.{{r|Iron Man: The Iron Age #1|2}}\n\n===[[Glossary:Modern Age|Modern Age]]===\n[[File:Stark Industries (Earth-616) from Tales of Suspense Vol 1 48 001.jpg|thumb|left]]\nTony Stark then continued to aggressively develop new technologies and innovations, leading Stark Industries to become a major contractor for both corporate and [[United States Government (Earth-616)|government]] concerns. While personally overseeing the using of his manufactured munitions and weapons by the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Army]] in the Middle East,{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 1|6}} Tony Stark was nearly killed by an exploding land mine; captured by some revolutionary terrorists, he was saved by scientist [[Ho Yinsen (Earth-616)|Ho Yinsen]], a fellow prisoner. Stark then developed a [[Iron Man Armor Model 1|suit]] of sturdy body armor that not only saved his injured heart, but also enabled him to escape imprisonment. Upon returning to the [[United States of America|United States]], Tony modified the crude battlesuit, ultimately building what would soon become the recognizable [[Iron Man Armor|armor of Iron Man]].{{r|Tales of Suspense #39}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 4 1|6}}\n\nBack in the United States, Tony proudly kept Stark Industries running, employing [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Virginia 'Pepper' Potts]] as his personal Executive Assistant and ex-boxer [[Harold Hogan (Earth-616)|Harold 'Happy' Hogan]] as chauffeur. Requiring the Iron Man Armor's chest plate (actually an [[Arc Reactor]]) to being kept alive, Stark introduced ''Iron Man'' as its bodyguard, starting to fund and finance the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]' activities (a superheroes group which he, as Iron Man, had founded), even setting his family's [[Manhattan]] manor as the Avengers' headquarters, known as the [[Avengers Mansion]].{{r|Iron Man: The Iron Age #1|2}} Stark also maintained his father's contract with S.H.I.E.L.D., producing equipment, weapons and vehicles for the organization, eventually becoming part of its [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Executive Board (Earth-616)|Supreme International Council]] as Head of Special Weapons Division.{{r|Strange Tales #135}}{{r|Iron Man: The Iron Age #2}}\n\nUnder Tony Stark's leadership, Stark Industries had several lucrative contracts with many financial institutions, but, despite his skill as an inventor and businessman, Stark's playboy image didn't sit well with many military and political figures, including [[United States Senate (Earth-616)|senator]] [[Harrington Byrd (Earth-616)|Harrington Byrd]], who frequently clashed with Tony over how he ran Stark Industries and performed under government contracts.{{r|Tales of Suspense #46|47}}\n\n====Stark International====\nAfter driving the company to new heights year after year, Tony Stark eventually suffered a crisis of conscience and declared that Stark would no longer produce weapons for S.H.I.E.L.D., the [[United States Government (Earth-616)|Government]], or any other parties.{{r|Iron Man #50|51}} As Stark Industries continued to change its public persona and strengthened the corporation's foreign interests, it became known as Stark International.{{r|Iron Man #73}}\n\n====Stane International====\nAs part of his ongoing efforts to destroy Tony Stark, Stark International Executive [[Obadiah Stane (Earth-616)|Obadiah Stane]] brought Stark to the edge of financial ruin. On top of the physical and psychological torments heaped upon him, Tony was eventually bought out by Stane, and Stark International was renamed in favor of its new owner.{{r|Iron Man #173}}\n\nEven after Obadiah Stane's downfall and death, [[Stane International (Earth-616)|Stane International]] remained a separate institution from Stark's companies. [[Justin Hammer (Earth-616)|Justin Hammer]] covertly acquired control of Stane International for his own dealings until Iron Man forced him to turn the company and its assets back over to Stark.{{r|Iron Man #283}}{{r|Iron Man #301}}\n\n====Stark Enterprises====\nAfter dragging himself out of the bottle, Tony Stark briefly worked with James Rhodes and the Erwin siblings at a small California firm called Circuits Maximus. After Obadiah Stane killed Morley Erwin, and his sister Cly left to join AIM, Stark and Rhodes got to work rebuilding the Stark legacy. Tony soon reopened his business with a new corporation called Stark Enterprises, now based on the West Coast.{{r|Iron Man #217}}\n\nDuring the Stark Enterprises days, Tony learned that Stane International had been bought out by Justin Hammer, and forced the billionaire to sign the company back over to him. Unfortunately, Tony then became liable for countless shady business dealings Stane had been involved in, as seen in the [[Crash and Burn]] event.{{r|Iron Man #301}}\n\n====Stark-Fujikawa====\nUpon Tony Stark's death, Stark Enterprises was bought out by Japanese firm [[Fujikawa Industries (Earth-616)|Fujikawa Industries]], and was renamed Stark-Fujikawa.{{r|Iron Man #329}}\n\n====Stark Solutions====\nAfter he returned from the Heroes Reborn universe and reestablished his identity, Tony Stark considered trying to reacquire his old assets from Stark-Fujikawa. Ultimately, however, he chose to proceed with his own separate company called Stark Solutions, with a focus on troubleshooting-for-hire to other firms.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #1}}\n\nStark suffered numerous setbacks after his Iron Man armor became sentient, giving him a case of \"techno-phobia\" where he relied upon older armor versions instead of creating a new one. He also suffered considerably in the public eye thanks to a media smear campaign initiated by his former friend, Tiberius Stone. After fighting with Stone in the virtual reality DreamVision, Stark retired from the public eye. He dismantled Stark Solutions and gave away his assets to the Avengers or the Maria Stark Foundation.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #37|41}}\n\n====Stark Returns====\nTony Stark eventually returned to work with the assistance of Trevor Donahue. Another industrialist and target of Tiberius Stone, Donahue passed away and left his company and personal fortune to Tony Stark. Stark used these assets and Donahue Development factories to restart '''Stark Enterprises'''.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #45}} It was also alleged that Stark's previous actions giving away his fortune were the result of a subliminal message implanted in his brain by Stone's DreamVision, although never conclusively proven.{{r|Iron Man Annual #2001}}\n\nWhen Rumiko finally learned the truth about Tony Stark's relationship with Iron Man, she came to understand the behavior that led to their separation. As reparation, she convinced her grandfather to sell Tony 49% interest in Stark Industries while Fujikawa retained 49% as well. The remaining 2% was in Rumiko's hands, but she willingly gave it back over to Tony without any strings.\n\nAs a result, Tony Stark once again possessed both the names and assets of all his previous companies: Stark Industries, Stark International, and Stark Enterprises.{{r|Iron Man Vol 3 #56}}\n\n====Dark Reign and Downfall====\nAfter numerous terrorist attacks perpetuated by [[Ezekiel Stane (Earth-616)|Ezekiel Stane]], Stark was forced to use an EMP which incapacitated Stane's tech and Stark's own.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 6}} The company suffered heavy losses,{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 7}} including the research, development, design, and manufacturing hubs.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 25}}\n\nIn the wake of [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s \"Dark Reign,\" Tony made [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Pepper Potts]] the CEO and COO of the company, who sold off everything she could, so Stark Industries existed \"as a corporate entity on paper only.\"{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 25}} When Tony Stark returned into the action, he founded a new company: [[Stark Resilient (Earth-616)|Stark Resilient]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 26}} He later passed the reins of the organization to Pepper Potts when he was being targeted by the Mandarin for the sake of the safety of the company's staff.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 519}}\n\n====Return of Stark Industries====\nAfter Tony's moral axis became inverted by a magic spell gone wrong in the end of the conflict known as [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]],{{r|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 3}} he targeted the city of [[San Francisco]] for the release of a commercialized version of the [[Extremis virus]]. The product's launch became the cornerstone of a new Stark Industries.{{r|Superior Iron Man Vol 1 1}} Months later, and following the return of normalcy for Tony's morality, the company crashed meteorically as a result of mismanagment due to Tony's superheroic endeavors.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 1}} The stocks of the company struggled for months afterwards,{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 7}} falling to a nearly 15-month low.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 8}} The assets of the company were under siege by the [[Stark Industries Board of Directors (Earth-616)|Board of Directors]] following Stark's disappearance for an undercover mission, which harmed the company even further.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 10}} Despite Tony's evenutal return, the Board of Directors remain extremely dissatisfied.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 12}}\n\nNot long afterwards, Tony Stark fell into a coma due to injuries sustained in battle.{{r|Civil War II Vol 1 8}} The reins of the company fell in the hands of Tony's biological mother [[Amanda Armstrong (Earth-616)|Amanda Armstrong]], but she delegated the duties of management to Tony's A.I. assistant [[Friday Stark (Earth-616)|Friday]]. Around this time, the shares of the company rose from the all-time low.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 4 3}} The chairman of the Board of Directors, [[Eric Lynch (Earth-616)|Eric Lynch]], rallied the other members to remove Amanda from the position of President.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 593}} Following the disappearance of Tony Stark's comatose body, Lynch led the take-over of the company and nominated himself to become the new director of the company.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 594}} However, Lynch was approached by rising crime boss [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|The Hood]], who believed there was a connection between Tony Stark's disappearance and the heroic endeavours of [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Victor von Doom]], who had taken up the mantle of Iron Man.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 599}} Before The Hood could coerce Lynch into handing him over his share of the company, Robbins and his criminal army were attacked by an army of [[Doombot|Doombots]] commanded by Doom, as well as the recently-resurfaced Tony Stark and [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]].{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 1 600}} In the aftermath of Lynch's attempted takeover, Tony set up a new company called [[Stark Unlimited (Earth-616)|Stark Unlimited]],{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 1}} which absorbed Stark International, [[Stark Solutions (Earth-616)|Stark Solutions]], [[Stark Resilient (Earth-616)|Stark Resilient]] and several other Stark companies as corporate subsidiaries.{{r|Tony Stark: Iron Man Vol 1 5}}\n\n==Executives and Staff==\n===Stark Industries===\n* [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Anthony 'Tony' Stark]] -
