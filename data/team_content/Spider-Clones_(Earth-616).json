He and Kaine soon realized the clones were unstable, degenerating and collapsing as the battle continued. When Ben unmasked one of the dying clones, he found only a faceless mass of flesh that quickly dissolved.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 227}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Clones of Peter Parker]]"
