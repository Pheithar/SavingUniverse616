Those within the conspiracy did not like the fact that super powered costumed heroes and violent vigilantes were whom the public looked to, and planned to use the anarchy and terror caused by Dos Soles to get the citizens to turn to the federal government and its [[United States Armed Forces (Earth-616)|armed forces]] for security and order.{{r|Punisher Vol 10 16}}\n\nTo achieve this, [[Mr. Secretary (Earth-616)|Mr. Secretary]] supplied Dos Soles with chemical weapons which were to be used in [[Los Angeles]],{{r|Punisher Vol 10 16}} and sent the black ops team [[Howling Commandos (Earth-616)|Howling Commandos]] to stop the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]].{{r|Punisher Vol 10 6}} [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M]] provided Dos Soles with the services of [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]],{{r|Punisher Vol 10 2}} then sent [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] as additional backup.{{r|Punisher Vol 10 4|6}}\n\n[[Guillermo Del Sol (Earth-616)|Guillermo Del Sol]] attempted to release the poison gas in Los Angeles, but the weapons were destroyed during the Punisher's assault on the Dos Soles warehouse in Los Angeles.{{r|Punisher Vol 10 4}} He came to Los Angeles with the objective of causing death and destruction, and getting the cartels and gangs to follow the Dos Soles Cartel in forming a national gang. Electro caused a citywide blackout resulting in Del Sol attacking the [[Los Angeles Police Department (Earth-616)|police]] throughout the city.{{r|Punisher Vol 10 5}}. While being pursued by the Punisher, a UAV took him out before he was captured by the Punisher.{{r|Punisher Vol 10 6}}\n\nAfterwards his brother, [[Hector Del Sol (Earth-616)|Hector Del Sol]], arrived in Los Angeles to finish the job. Dos Soles armed the gangs which went on a spree of murder, burning, and looting in Los Angeles,{{r|Punisher Vol 10 11}} which ended in the bombing of several high-rise buildings in the city.{{r|Punisher Vol 10 12}} Unlike his brother, he did not plan to lead a national gang formed by the cartels and gangs. He knew that the gangs could not be controlled, and therefore saw his job as unleashing the gangs to rampage in the cities and to empty the prisons of hardened criminals.{{r|Punisher Vol 10 14}} After Punisher discovered and revealed the government conspiracy, Hector Del Sol attempted to flee back to [[Mexico]], but was intercepted by the Punisher who then executed him live on television to send a message to criminals and terrorists.{{r|Punisher Vol 10 18}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Military-grade poison gas (weapon of mass destruction){{r|Punisher Vol 10 2|6}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mexican Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Cartels]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Arms Dealers]]"
