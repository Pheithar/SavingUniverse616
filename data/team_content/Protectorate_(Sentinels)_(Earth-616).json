After learning that [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] had buried the remains of Onslaught's [[Sentinels]] in a [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]] landfill, Fabian dug them up and began to rebuild them in a warehouse, redesigning them to look like [[Iron Man (Anthony \"Tony\" Stark)|Iron Man]], [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], and [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] of the Avengers. As Fabian had only working CPU unit, he created an interface between himself and the CPU so that he could control the machines. However, the machines ate away at Fabian's already fragile mind, enslaving him to their will. The four robots, terming themselves the Protectorate, set out to \"protect\" New York. Their appearance drew the attention of the remaining Avengers, among whom were the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Firestar]], and [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]], all mutants. Recognizing them as mutants with their Sentinel technology, the Protectorate deemed all of the Avengers mutants and refused to acknowledge them as the true Avengers, as Fabian had programmed them to believe the Avengers dead. The Protectorate assaulted the Avengers and managed to hold their own, briefly containing them in the Ant-Man unit's cocoon. In the meantime, though, [[Edwin Jarvis (Earth-616)|Edwin Jarvis]] had sought out Stankowitz at his warehouse and learned what had happened. When Fabian realized that the Avengers were alive and that he was \"the bad guy\", he asked Jarvis to free him from the CPU and destroy the Protectorate's motherboard. Jarvis did so, and the Protectorate were immediately rendered immobile. Fabian was subsequently sent to a hospital for extensive treatment.{{r|Avengers Annual Vol 2 #1999}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/protectorate.htm\n}}"
