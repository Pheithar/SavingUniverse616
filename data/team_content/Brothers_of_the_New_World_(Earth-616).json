The Brothers said that they were going to live off the land and were led by [[Cry (Earth-616)|Cry]] who had a thing for girls. The group didn't kidnap any girls, the girls simply disappeared. In their pocket was the corrupt Sheriff [[Dennis Terril (Earth-616)|Dennis Terril]] who helped make girls disappear. Anyone in the town that made any problems for them, was assaulted and given a warning.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 3}} \n\nIn the heavily guarded walled compound, the cult kept a \"harem\" of missing girls. The [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (Earth-616)|ATF]] agent [[Cassie Lathrop (Earth-616)|Cassie Lathrop]] who had been investigating and was jumped, was added to the group. Except for one recently added girl (who had been missing for a month), all the others had \"Stockholm Syndrome\".{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 4}} [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] tracked down the Brothers to their compound, seeking revenge for the death of [[Lucy Braddock (Earth-616)|Lucy Braddock]], a girl who escaped the Brothers. He snuck into the compound and slaughtered them all the Brothers, killing Cry last.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 5}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Slavers]]\n[[Category:Earth Religions]]"
