Unfortunately, the R.C.X. quickly became a law unto themselves and began operating in a manner which many considered unethical-including their unwilling ally, [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]]. The R.C.X. were headquartered for a time at his home, [[Braddock Manor]], where agents [[Michael (RCX) (Earth-616)|Michael]] and [[Matthew (Gabriel) (Earth-616)|Gabriel]] cared for the mutated children known as the [[Warpies (Race)|Warpies]]. \n\nThe R.C.X. were eventually subverted by [[Nigel Orpington-Smythe (Earth-616)|Nigel Orpington-Smythe]], who disabled the [[Mastermind (Computer) (Earth-616)|Mastermind computer]] at Braddock Manor and placed the principal agents in suspended animation while attempting to turn the Warpies into his own private army. They were eventually freed by [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]], who defeated Smythe, but the R.C.X. was shut down soon aftward and replaced by the agency [[Black Air (Earth-616)|Black Air]]. One of the R.C.X.'s former members, Joshua N'Dingi, became the cybernetically enhanced [[Joshua N'Dingi (Earth-616)|Doctor Crocodile]] after a [[Robert Arnold (Earth-616)|warpie baby]] exploded close to him.\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.C.X.\n}}\n[[Category:British Organizations]]"
