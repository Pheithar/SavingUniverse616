This situation had caused a problem for the Canadian government due to [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] demise. [[Iron Man (Anthony \"Tony\" Stark)|Iron Man]] agreed to help the Canadian government by sending a group of registered heroes to Canada. [[Walter Langkowski (Earth-616)|'''Sasquatch''']] and [[Elizabeth Twoyoungmen (Earth-616)|'''Talisman''']] teamed up with [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|'''Arachne''']], [[Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616)|'''Beta Ray Bill''']], '''Guardian''' ([[Michael Pointer (Earth-616)|Michael Pointer]], formerly known as the Collective), and [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|'''US Agent''']] to form the new '''Omega Flight''' in order to fight a horde of demons, a [[Tanaraq (Earth-616)|Tanaraq]] possessed Sasquatch, and the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]]. During the battle that followed Beta Ray Bill tricked the demon hordes to follow him into a dimensional portal, once inside the portal Guardian destroyed it trapping Beta Ray Bill and the demons in another dimension. Despite Bill sacrificing himself, Omega Flight still remained together.{{r|Omega Flight #1|5}}\n\nThree days before the discovery of the [[Skrull Invasion]], Pointer went at [[Cape Columbia]] to try to recruit [[Narya (Earth-616)|Snowbird]], in vain as she despised him for having cause Alpha Flight's death as the Collective (including [[Michael Twoyoungmen (Earth-616)|Shaman]] who had raised her like a father), wearing [[James Hudson (Earth-616)|James Hudson]]'s uniform and asking her to join a team named after Alpha Flight's enemies.{{r|Incredible Hercules #117}}\n\nThe team eventually disbanded<!-- Later, they were apparently however disbanded, as Beta Ray Bill was back in Earth's dimension but returned in space, US Agent became a member of Hank Pym's [[Mighty Avengers (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]], Pointer tried to live a normal live but was kidnapped by Osborn who manipulate him to make him join his [[X-Men (Osborn) (Earth-616)|Dark X-Men]], and Arachne returned to the United States.{{r|Dark X-Men: The Beginning #2}} -->\n\n===Second Omega Flight===\nA new incarnation of Omega Flight was later assembled by the Department H during the [[Marvel NOW! (2012 Event)|aftermath]] of the [[Avengers vs. X-Men (Event)|Avengers vs. X-Men conflict]]. It consisted of [[Validator (Earth-616)|'''Validator''']], [[Boxx (Earth-616)|'''Boxx''']], [[Kingdom (Earth-616)|'''Kingdom''']], and a [[Wendigo (Omega Flight) (Earth-616)|'''Wendigo''']]. Omega Flight was sent in by [[Department H (Earth-616)|Department H]] to investigate one of the spots left by [[Ex Nihilo (Earth-616)|Ex Nihilo]] in [[Regina (City)|Regina]], [[Canada]]. With the exception of Validator, all members of the team were killed in action by the hostile organisms.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 10}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each teammates' arsenal\n| Notes                   = \n* Despite appearing in preview art, being \"announced\" as a member of the team in {{cl|Civil War: The Initiative #1}} and appearing in the mini-series, [[Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616)|Beta Ray Bill]] never officially joined the team, he merely helped them against the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]] and their demonic allies. He was hardly even acknowledged by Omega Flight as even being there. However, the Omega Flight entry in the {{cl|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update #4}} lists him as an honorary member.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Department H Projects]]\n[[Category:Canadian Security Intelligence Service]]\n[[Category:Canadian Organizations]]"
