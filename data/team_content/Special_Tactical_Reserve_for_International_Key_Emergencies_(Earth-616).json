Slaymaster murdered several of the telepaths including [[Kevin Mulhearn (Earth-616)|Kevin]] and [[Vicki Reppion (Earth-616)|Vicki]], but [[Thomas Lennox (Earth-616)|Tom Lennox]], [[Alison Double (Earth-616)|Alison Double]] and [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Elizabeth Braddock]] escaped thanks to the arrival of Braddock's brother Brian, AKA Captain Britain. S.T.R.I.K.E was subsequently replaced by the [[Resources Control Executive (Earth-616)|RCX (Resources  Control Executive)]].\n\n==Members==\n{{Main|Special Tactical Reserve for International Key Emergencies (Earth-616)/Members}}\n{{Seealso|:Category:Special Tactical Reserve for International Key Emergencies members}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.R.I.K.E.
