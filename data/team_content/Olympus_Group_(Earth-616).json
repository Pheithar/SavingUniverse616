He reversed his edict regarding humanity and instead began studying humanity, and formed the '''Olympus Group''' with the Dodekatheon which included the formation of the [[Wall Street]] situated company of the same name.{{r|Hercules Vol 3 2}}{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; The [[Olympians]]' entry}}\n\nSince the desolation of Olympus by the undead forces of Amatsu-Mikaboshi, it has formed the base of the [[Olympians]] power on [[Earth]].{{r|Hercules Vol 3 #3|5}}{{r|Incredible Hercules #123}}<!-- \n\n...{{r|Hercules Vol 3 #3|5}} -->\n\nThe first sign of the Olympus group's new direction came when Hera assumed control upon the death of Zeus. Combining his shares in the company with hers, she allied with [[Typhon (Earth-616)|Typhon]], the Volcano Titan, and forced out [[Poseidon Aegaeus (Earth-616)|Poseidon]],{{r|Incredible Hercules #123}} [[Aphrodite Ourania (Earth-616)|Aphrodite]],{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; [[Aphrodite Ourania (Earth-616)|Aphrodite]]'s entry}} [[Phoebus Apollo (Earth-616)|Apollo]],{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; [[Phoebus Apollo (Earth-616)|Apollo]]'s entry}} [[Dionysus Acratophorus (Earth-616)|Dionysus]],{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; [[Dionysus Acratophorus (Earth-616)|Dionysus]]'s entry}} [[Hephaestus Aetnaeus (Earth-616)|Hephaestus]],{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; [[Hephaestus Aetnaeus (Earth-616)|Hephaestus]]'s entry}} and [[Hermes Diaktoros (Earth-616)|Hermes]].{{r|Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica #1|; [[Hermes Diaktoros (Earth-616)|Hermes]]'s entry}}\n\nThe Olympus Group owns the [[Excello Soap Company]], and was quietly funding [[Pythagoras Dupree (Earth-616)|Pythagoras Dupree]]'s obsessive war with [[Athena Parthenos (Earth-616)|Athena]] until his death.{{r|Incredible Hercules #127}}\n\nDuring the [[Dark Reign]], the Olympus Group was working towards \"Continuum\u00a9\", the ultimate goal of which was to replace the Earth with a new, better version, leaving behind all the baggage the world had created and ending the \"Iron Age\" of classical Greek mythology. Continuum\u00a9 was opposed by [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] and his allies, the Avengers, at the cost of Hercules' life.{{r|Assault on New Olympus #1}}\n\n====The Heroic Age====\nIn the wake of Continuum\u00a9, Athena took control of the Olympians and returned them to Olympus. Control of the Olympus Group devolved to Amadeus Cho, ally of Hercules, who had been selected as the \"[[Prince of Power]]\" for the new age.{{r|Heroic Age: Prince of Power #1}}\n\nThe Olympus Group was strengthened by adding the assets of the late Hercules to their portfolio.{{r|Hercules: Fall of an Avenger #1}} Said stock includes but is not limited to: multiple wineries and breweries, a nude beach resort, an adult entertainment shop and a significant share in [[Stark Enterprises]].{{r|Hercules: Fall of an Avenger #2}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * The  [[Olympians]]' entry in {{cl|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #8}} lists [[Hades (Earth-616)|Pluto/Hades]], while omitting [[Demeter (Olympian) (Earth-616)|Demeter]].
