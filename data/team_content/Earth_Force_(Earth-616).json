The [[Ennead|Heliopolitan]] death god, [[Seth (Earth-616)|Seth]], brought these mortals to [[Abydos|his realm]] and bestowed upon them the sign of Aton. This special mark gave them incredible powers and they were told they were to be \u201ca force to protect and preserve the Earth.\u201d However, this power was to come at a price: Earth Force was ordered to kill the [[Asgardian]], [[Hogun (Earth-616)|Hogun]], who also happened to be in the same hospital as they were after he was seriously injured in a fight with [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] and the police. When Earth Force returned to the hospital, they clashed with [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] who was protecting his fellow Asgardian. Even though Earth Force had Thor beaten, Earth Lord and Wind Warrior felt that they should reevaluate their actions and decided to leave, taking a belligerent Skyhawk with them.{{Citation}}\n\nEarth Force returned and asked Thor for redemption after realizing that Seth was evil and merely using them to serve his foul plans. Thor agreed and together they fought the armies of Seth for the liberation of [[Asgard]] and the defense of all life everywhere. Earth Force confronted their manipulator, and even though they tried their best, Seth was too powerful for them and he left the three individuals at death\u2019s door once more. After Seth\u2019s ultimate defeat, the Gods of [[Celestial Heliopolis|Heliopolis]] restored the lives of Earth Force and returned them to their hospital beds mere moments after they were kidnapped by Seth. Earth Lord noticed that he still had the glowing sign of Aton in his hand and presumed that Wind Warrior and Skyhawk retained the mark as well.{{Citation}}\n\nEarth Force had not been seen until a confrontation between [[Jackie Lukus (Earth-616)|Bloodaxe]] and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] was brought to the attention of police and special task force, [[Code: Blue (Earth-616)|Code: Blue]]. Kyle Brock was among the police officers at the scene, and when no one was looking, he transformed into Earth Lord once more. He sent a silent signal to the other members of Earth Force, and together with Code: Blue, the two teams along with Doctor Strange were able to stop Bloodaxe before any serious damage was done to others.{{Citation}}\n\nFollowing the registration-initiated \"[[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]],\" Skyhawk registered as a superhero with the US government and was apparently assigned to work in [[Washington (State)|Washington state]] as part of the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|50-State Initiative]]. Whether the other two members of the original Earth Force were assigned there with him, or if they even registered, is unrevealed.{{r|Civil War: Front Line Vol 1 11}}\n\n==Members==\n*[[Winston Manchester (Earth-616)|Skyhawk]] - Winston Manchester was a businessman working in New York, who had been hospitalized.
