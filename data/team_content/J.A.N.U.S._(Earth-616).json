The group tasked him with helping [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]] regain the ability to become Man-Wolf, turning him into an asset. With Osborn's success using [[Calvin Zabo (Earth-616)|Mister Hyde]], the [[Unwanted (Earth-616)|Unwanted]], and [[Ashley Kafka (Earth-616)|Ashley Kafka]]'s clone to manipulate Jameson, they were satisfied with his results.
