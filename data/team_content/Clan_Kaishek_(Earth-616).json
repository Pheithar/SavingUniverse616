Meanwhile they stole from tributes the court received to build their private fortress. It's a clan of warriors and conquerors, whose criminal empire spans throughout Asia and eastern Europe.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 150|153}}\n\n[[Clan Yashida (Earth-616)|Clan Yashida]] came under their control after the deaths of Shingen & [[Mariko Yashida (Earth-616)|Mariko Yashida]].
