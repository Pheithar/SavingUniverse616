It's an ethnic Corsican mob active mostly in Corsica and the seaport / city of Marseilles in France. They were made famous in the \"French Connection\" case.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unione_Corse] They used to control the heroin trade in Europe and supplied the American Italian Mafia with heroin from Turkey, before they were displaced in the European and American heroin trade by the Silician Mafia (who were later displaced by the Mexican and Colombians in the United States, and in Europe by their previous suppliers, the Turkish Mafia).\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:French Organizations]]"
