They planned to market [[Thunderbolt (Drug)|Thunderbolt]], a super addictive drug, one that killed its user within one hour. It formed a partnership with [[Nguyen Ngoc Coy (Earth-616)|General Coy]] and the corrupt [[Prince Baran (Earth-616)|Prince Baran]]. They perceived [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] to be a threat and sent men to kill him in [[Madripoor]]. Twenty one Yakuza were killed by Wolverine in the attempt, but later they made another attempt and believed themselves successful. \n\nFaking his death, Wolverine had his deadlike body sent to Japan. He then went to the clan's compound and fought his way through their ranks, slaughtering Yakuza soldiers. Wolverine destroyed the drug factory and decimated the clan, with Dai Kumo himself being killed by the assassin [[Reiko (Earth-616)|Reiko]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 31|33}} \n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Japanese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Yakuza]]"
