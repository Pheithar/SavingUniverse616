Jonah Jameson]] as a cybernetic update the [[Super Soldier Serum|Super-Soldier]] program acting as black ops for the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|United States Army]]. Three women were chosen for the team and each was given a different cybernetic enhancement. Unfortunately, the upgrades also cause mental instability. Two members of  S.C.A.R.s began taking mercenary jobs on the side to allow them to kill more. Finally,  S.C.A.R.s was disbanded.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 #219}} [[Noelle Blanc (Earth-616)|Ballistique]] and [[Rococo (Earth-616)|Rococo]] were both mind-wiped and given civilian lives.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 #210}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 #215}} [[Sylvius (Earth-616)|Sylvius]], who appeared mentally stable, was allowed to stay in military service, but was told Ballistique and Rocky died.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 #219}} She continued her service and was eventually recruited by the [[Mutant Response Division (Earth-616)|MRD]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 #204}}\n\nBallistique led a civil life for decades as a war vet suffering from PTSD until she contacted [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]] looking for mental relief from her anguish. Monet agreed to help, but her [[Telepathy|telepathic]] interventions inadvertently unlocked Ballistique's true memories. Almost immediately Ballistique traveled to Richmond, [[Virginia (State)|Virginia]] to kill General Ryan.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 #210}} She next went to [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska (State)|Nebraska]] to attack a \"Nurse Coco\" with a flame-thrower. Nurse Coco turned out to be Rococo, her former associate. With Rococo's memories restored the pair set off for [[New York City]] to assassinated Mayor Jameson.{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 #215}} \n\nThe pair reunited with Sylvius and attempted to assassinate Mayor Jameson at a public rally, but were foiled by [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations]]' and [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]]'s intervention. However, Ballistique did fatally wound [[Guido Carosella (Earth-616)|Strong Guy]]{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 #216|#218}} The trio was successful abducting Dr. Pock, but were again foiled by X-Factor and Black Cat. Monet was able to psychically attack Ballistique, leaving her in a permanent coma.
