'''[[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]]''' and '''[[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]]''' are '''opposing magnetic poles''', serving to control the flow of the energies at play here... Energies under constant pressure from the forces of nature itself. The '''elemental extremes''' of '''[[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]]''', '''[[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]]''' and '''[[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]]'''... stimulated by the unrestrained energies of '''man''' and the '''heavens''', free of any grounding or gravity.

She also initially believed that Alpha-Level Mutants (who included the Twelve [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Phoenix]], [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]]) could be part of them. She started disregarding her own theory after learning that [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Sinister]] was part of the list, and eventually thought it to be pointless.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 94}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Apocalypse: The Twelve]]"
