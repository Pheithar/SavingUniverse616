As the fighting continued, they realized that they needed financing to carry on the fight. Like the other paramilitaries groups, they turned to smuggling cocaine for the Colombians and within Belfast itself the drug trade, prostitution, loan-sharking, and pornography. Since the ceasefire, the political conflict mutated into a gang war over territory.{{r|Punisher Vol 6 18}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The Red Hand Commando were the smallest of the loyalist terrorist groups and the most selective.\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Irish Organizations]]"
