In the final battle the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] and many of their allies seemingly sacrificed their lives to destroy Onslaught.{{r|Onslaught Marvel Universe #1}} In reality they were transported to a pocket dimension with a reproduction of Earth (later dubbed [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Counter-Earth]] by [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]] where they were reborn into new lives that were similar to those of their lives on Earth-616.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 2 #1}}{{r|Captain America Vol 2 #1}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 2 #1}}{{r|Avengers Vol 2 #1}} After living in this pocket dimension the heroes were eventually returned to their native Earth.{{r|Heroes Reborn: The Return Vol 1 1|5}}\n\nFollowing the events of [[M-Day]],{{r|House of M #8}} Onslaught was resurrected and he immediately sought to get revenge against Franklin Richards attacking him at the [[Baxter Building]] home of his family the Fantastic Four. When Onslaught kept on possessing the various members of the Fantastic Four, Franklin sought to escape by creating a new [[Counter-Earth (Onslaught Reborn)|pocket dimension]] based on the original Counter-Earth to escape in.{{r|Onslaught Reborn Vol 1 1}}\n\nThis pocket dimension had it's own version of the Avengers and [[Fantastic Four (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] based on the lives the heroes lived when they were reborn on Counter-Earth, however there were many distinct differences. Unlike Counter-Earth, the heroes of this world were not transported from Earth-616 to live out new lives, they were all creations of Franklin Richard's mind. For example, unlike his [[Thor Odinson (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Counter-Earth counterpart]] the Thor in this dimension reverts into Donald Blake after being separated from his hammer [[Mjolnir]] for sixty seconds.{{r|Onslaught Reborn Vol 1 3}} Also unlike Counter-Earth or Earth-616, Hawkeye is not [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Clint Barton]] on this world, but the mutant [[James Howlett (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Logan]], known in many realities as [[Wolverine]].{{r|Onslaught Reborn Vol 1 5}}\n\n==The End of the Fantastic Four==\nThe [[Quiet Man (Earth-616)|Quiet Man]] and the [[Psycho-Man (Earth-616)|Psycho Man]] opened a portal to the Onslaught Reborn's Counter-Earth. From there came out the Onslaught Reborn Avengers that battled against the [[Earth-616|Prime Marvel Universe]]'s heroes; that Avengers team was more similar to [[Avengers (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Heroes Reborn Avengers]] than the Onslaught version: [[Clinton Barton (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Clint Barton]] was [[Hawkeye]], wearing the same suit [[Clint Barton (Earth-616)|the 616 Clint]] wore during [[Heroes Reborn (1996 Event)|Heroes Reborn]], [[Steven Rogers (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Captain America]] had on his uniform the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s eagle, rather than the classic \"A\", like in [[Captain America Vol 2|Heroes Reborn Captain America's Series]]; also, [[Simon Williams (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], who were members of the [[Masters of Evil (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]], were present as Avengers. These evil Avengers were killed in battle, except for [[Clinton Barton (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Hawkeye (Barton)]], [[Bruce Banner (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Hulk]], and the two Avengers who were not present in that battle: [[James Howlett (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Hawkeye (Logan)]] and [[Henry Pym (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]].{{r|Fantastic Four #642|645}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = In [[Fantastic Four Vol 5 13|the Fantastic Four story arc]], in the team of Avengers there are new characters that weren't present during the [[Onslaught Reborn Vol 1]] series: [[Simon Williams (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] who were in the [[Masters of Evil (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]] team of supervillains and the [[Robert Bruce Banner (Onslaught Reborn) (Earth-616)|Hulk]] who was an enemy in the original miniseries.\n| Links                   = \n}}"
