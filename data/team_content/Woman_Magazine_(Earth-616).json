The Bugle suffering from low sales prevented [[J. Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]] from being involved with Woman Magazine and controlling its content. As a result, Woman Magazine began printing articles on women's lib, interviews with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Millett Kate Millett], and stories about careers for women.\n\nJameson disliked the content. To him, the magazine should contain new diets, fashions and recipes. Stuff that he thought was useful to women. However, he didn't have time to devote to the magazine in order to \"fix\" it.\n\nEventually, Jameson chose to hire Air Force officer turned writer [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol Danvers]] as the editor for Woman Magazine. However, Carol quickly put her foot down and made it clear that Jameson could just forget about her putting diets and recipes in the magazine.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 1}} She often clashed with Jameson over the magazine's content.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 6}} Finally, Jameson chose to fire her. Reluctantly, [[Tracy Burke (Earth-616)|Tracy Burke]] took over as editor.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 22}}\n\n===Staff===\n* [[J. Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J.
