Hired to kill [[Rudev Broga (Earth-616)|Colonel Rudev Broga]] in his [[New York City|New York]] hospital room, [[Bombardier (Earth-616)|Bombardier]] detonated a bomb in the hospital's waiting room as a distraction while [[Cordite (Earth-616)|Cordite]] and [[Clash (Earth-616)|Clash]] infiltrated the building. Aided by a turncoat government agent, they succeeded in drugging Broga and taking out his bodyguards, although the suit was killed in the process. The final bodyguard, [[Cary Armstrong (Earth-616)|Cary Armstrong]], managed to wound Cordite, but was grievously injured after the arrival of [[Flare (Shadowforce Alpha) (Earth-616)|Flare]] and [[Stampede (Earth-616)|Stampede]]. \n\nThe arrival of the [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]], who had battled and captured Bombadier, forced them to flee, but they subsequently signaled [[Shell (Shadowforce Alpha) (Earth-616)|Shell]] and [[Shot (Earth-616)|Shot]] to destroy the room.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Super Special Vol 1 #1}}\n\nShell And Shot found that the Scarlet Spider and Broga had survived. Shot was taken down by the Spider, although Shell managed to escape with Broga. He took him to Operating Theater 8, where Clash had forced  [[Greg Chasen (Earth-616)|Greg Chasen]], [[Raymond Crow (Earth-616)|Raymond Crow]], and [[Ellen Grantz (Earth-616)|Ellen Grantz]] to operate on the wounded Cordite.\n\nWhen the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|police]] shut down the power, the Spider took out Shell, Stampede, and Flare, but was captured by Clash and the recovering Cordite. The arrival of a revived Cary Armstrong turned the tide, allowing the Spider to rescue Broga and the captive doctors. Cornered, Clash and Cordite whipped out grenades, but were prevented from going out in a blaze of glory when Strongarm neutralized the explosives.{{r|Spider-Man Super Special Vol 1 #1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [//www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/shdowfrcalphascrlt.htm Shadowforce Alpha] at ''marvunapp.com''\n}}"
