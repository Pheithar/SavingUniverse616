They became the masters of Aleister's subconscious, channeling their power through it, harassing him with monsters born from his own twisted psyche.<!-- {{r|Marvel Fanfare #52|; Mirror, Mirror}} -->\n\nAleister managed to sent a call towards his past friend [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Stephen Strange]]. Finally hearing his call for help, Strange managed to rejoin Aleister, but had no way to free his friend. Aleister urged Strange to save his soul by the only possible way: destroying the force-wheel. Strange blasted it, freeing Aleister's soul while his body was destroyed and Strange was returned to his plane.{{r|Marvel Fanfare #52|; Mirror, Mirror}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The Keepers of the Great Silver Gate were possibly inspired by or another name for the [[Ancient Ones]] guarding the [[w:c:lovecraft:Ultimate Gate|Ultimate Gate]] in \"[[w:c:lovecraft:Through the Gates of the Silver Key|Through the Gates of the Silver Key]]\"{{r|[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/kanealeisterds.htm Aleister Kane at the Marvel Appendix]}} (July, 1934) by [[Howard Phillips Lovecraft|H.
