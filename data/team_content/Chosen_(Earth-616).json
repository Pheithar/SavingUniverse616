The beings evolved into super powered beings, some of them having outward alterations and other having interior alterations. The two groups began to segregate and the physically deformed beings became known as the [[Rejects (Earth-616)|Rejects]], while the other, more humanoid, group became the Chosen. The Celestials, who were called \"Space Gods\", returned four times and judged both groups, finding them acceptable and leaving them to progress until their next appearance. The Space Gods were worshiped and considered saviors by both the Rejects and the Chosen, each group praying to the Celestials to sway the gods to their own petty purposes. \n\nAfter believing that the Space Gods did not hear their prayers, a third group emerged, compromised of both Rejects and Chosen, calling themselves, the [[Beginagains (Earth-616)|Beginagains]]. Eventually, all groups began to become envious of each other and the whole planet began to war with each other. The Chosen began to build huge cities, while the Rejects moved to the forests and woods. The Beginagains moved underground, so as to not be seen with either group.{{r|X-Factor #43|50}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = The Chosen are seemingly an equivalent to the [[Eternals (Race)|Eternals]] being great-powered human-looking individuals, opposed to physically deformed Rejects who seemingly stands for their world [[Deviants (Race)|Deviants]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
