The [[Homo superior|Mutants]] are in their crosshairs.    \n|[[Jeffrey Bannister (Earth-616)|Jeffry]]|Image1=Jeff Bannister (Earth-616) from Wolverine Vol 7 2 0001.jpg\n|And so are you, agent Bannister.\n|[[Delores Ramirez (Earth-616)|Delores]]|Image2=Delores Ramirez (Earth-616) from Wolverine Vol 7 8 001.jpg}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 7 8}}\n\n===Founding===\nThe X-Desk came into being upon [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Prof. Charles Xavier]]'s founding of the new mutant home nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]. A specifically select wing manned by upper echelon C.I.A directors whom relay contact information between special agents acting both on side and in the field on their behalf while commencing missions. Their main facility is keeping tabs on all associated instances of Homo Superior and their various affiliates across the globe. Surveying actions related to them, monitoring worldly events surrounding their involvement, pinching and cataloging any memorable X related paraphernalia that pops up across the market; public, legal, black or otherwise.\n\n===Activity===\nThere have been hushed whispers of the clandestine groupings avocation into the affairs of the newly ascendant mutant nation. A secret so well kept that not even the spooks within it's own establishment properly register them as a credible extension of the C.I.A. Above board the secret operations keep in contact with Krakoa's [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council of Krakoa]], as was evident with Agent Ramirez tipping off [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] of the X-Men to [[Homines Verendi (Earth-616)|Verendi's]] tampering with the [[Flowers of Krakoa|Krakoan Medicine]] supply to [[Madripoor]]. Although this may have been a personal bid as the abettor whom tipped her off had a sickly mother whom couldn't walk and mutant medicine enabled \n\n===Subjects of Interest===\nWith the sudden onset of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]]'s rise, the X-Desk has tasked itself with keeping a sharp eye on the mutants checking in & out all across the world through their home tailored [[Gateways|gates]]. One of their more critical items of study are the remnants of the agencies [[Team X (Earth-616)|Team X]] and it's wayward operatives who have long since gone their separate ways. One in particular which the Central Intelligence keeps a close eye on, as well as [[Jeffrey Bannister (Earth-616)|those he associates]] with, is [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|James Howlett Logan]]. As of late, the X-Desk has potentially acquired the services of said focus of their observation's old associate [[Christoph Nord (Earth-616)|Christopher Nord]] as a contact or field operative.\n\n| Equipment               = '''Remote Spy Drones'''\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = '''Laser Artillery'''\n| Notes                   =\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n\n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]\n[[Category:Government Organizations]]"
