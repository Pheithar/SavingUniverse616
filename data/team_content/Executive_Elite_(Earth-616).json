The members of the organization were Bashur as Commcast, blade artist [[Anastasia Summit (Earth-616)|Rive]], who wielded an energy sword and wore wrist-mounted spikes, and the last member of the group was techno-construct assembler [[Amie Zamborano (Earth-616)|Makeshift]], who could rapidly create technology advanced weapons. With his knowledge of cloning, Bashur made copies of himself and his teammates, but a problem with the process ultimately prevented further duplication, leaving him one last ancillary body. When [[Nyko Hafghanaghan (Earth-616)|Nyko Halfghanaghan]] sought revenge for the apparent murder of his brother [[Pico Halfghanagan (Earth-616)|Pico]], he tasked the [[Jacob Gavin, Jr. (Earth-616)|Courier]] with hiring the Executive Elite to eliminate the three main suspects on his list; mercenary [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], mutant soldier [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]], and mutant shape-shifter [[Vanessa Carlysle (Earth-616)|Copycat]]. As payment, they were offered information on the will of arms dealer [[Tyler Dayspring (Earth-4935)|Tolliver]], which was to lead to a hidden cache of advanced technology. Realizing that they needed the information that the Elite had, Deadpool and his associate [[Jack Hammer (Earth-616)|Weasel]] lured the Elite into the open by making Deadpool a target; clones of Bashur and his teammates ambushed Deadpool in [[Sarajevo]], where Deadpool was rendered unconscious with a strong electrical charge. They took Deadpool to their mobile base known as \"the Edsel,\" where they sought to learn more about Tolliver's will by using a device to tap into Deadpool's memories; however, Weasel rescued him. Bashur sought to escape, but was killed by Weasel while Deadpool killed Rive and Makeshift; Deadpool and Weasel gained the information they sought{{r|Deadpool: The Circle Chase Vol 1 #3}}.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://marvel.com/universe/Executive_Elite\n}}"
