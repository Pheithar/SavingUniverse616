Their rituals caused several disturbances throughout [[New York City|New York]], including the appearance of a [[Chronosites|Chronosite]] in [[Manhattan]].\n\nThese disturbances caught the attention of the new [[Iron Man]], [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Victor von Doom]], who enlisted the help of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] in order to stop them and secretly evaluate [[Nadia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]] in the process.\n\nIron Man had Wasp infiltrate the base of operations of the Champions of Anamelech, [[Susan Storm Camp for Girls' Leadership]], in order to pinpoint the source of the magical interferences. When Nadia found out the Champions, they tried to use her as a sacrifice for a ritual. The Avengers intervened, and confronted another Chronosite summoned by the Champions of Anamelech. With Wasp's help, Iron Man cast a spell to vanish the Chronosite, stripping the Champions of their weapons and power in the process.{{r|Avengers Vol 7 7}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The leader of the Champions of Anamelech intended to become President of the United States.
