As [[A.R.M.O.R.]] is located in Florida, they work closely with A.R.M.O.R.\n\nWhile the team investigated a disturbance in the Citrusville swamp (home to the [[Nexus of All Realities]] and Man-Thing), [[John Kelly (Earth-616)|Siege]] was bitten on the face by a [[Wade Wilson (Earth-2149)|zombie Deadpool]] and despite his cybernetic nature was quickly turned into a zombie as well. He attacked [[Jennifer Kale (Earth-616)|Jennifer Kale]], making lewd references to her undergarments \"and what's beneath those and what's beneath that and what's beneath that.\" His onboard computer had alerted A.R.M.O.R. to the fact that he was seemingly malfunctioning, and triggered his self-destruct mechanism. [[Conquistador (Command) (Earth-616)|Conquistador]] was ripped apart by zombies after they realized he wasn't made of flesh and blood.\n\nBoth [[Wundarr (Earth-616)|Aquarian]] and Kale (who was suffering from a catatonic shock) were brought back to A.R.M.O.R. central command, [[The Hollow]], to receive the medical attention they needed.{{r|Marvel Zombies 3 Vol 1 1}}\n\nConquistador was replaced on the team by a [[Conquistador II (Command) (Earth-616)|second Conquistador]], who was then secretly captured by the Skrulls, who substituted [[Devil Dinosaur (Skrull) (Earth-616)|one of their own]] in his place. When the Skrulls \"secret invasion\" was revealed, the Command were assisted by [[Melati Kusuma (Earth-616)|Komodo]] and [[Heidi Sladkin (Earth-616)|Riot]] in taking out the Skrull infiltrator.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 19}}\n\n==The Command==\n*[[Jennifer Kale (Earth-616)|Jennifer Kale]] \n*[[Wundarr (Earth-616)|Aquarian]] - (Wundarr)\n*[[John Kelly (Earth-616)|Siege]] - (John Kelly)\n*[[Conquistador (Command) (Earth-616)|Conquistador]]\n*[[Conquistador II (Command) (Earth-616)|Conquistador (replacement)]]\n*[[Devil Dinosaur (Skrull) (Earth-616)|\"Conquistador\" (Devil Dinosaur skrull)]]\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Siege's plasma pulse cannon\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:50-State Initiative]]"
