But '''why?''' It makes no '''sense!'''|[[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)]]|Hawkeye Vol 4 16}}\nThe Champions were the first West Coast-based superhuman team. They formed much as did the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], with several heroes meeting by chance against a great threat, in their case the [[Olympians|Greek god]] of death, [[Hades (Earth-616)|Pluto]]{{r|Champions #1|3}}. The group consisted of two former [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] ([[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] and [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]]), Greek god of strength [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules,]] supernatural avenger [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)]], and the Russian spy called [[Natasha Romanoff (Earth-616)|Black Widow,]] who acted as team leader.{{r|Champions #4}}\n\nAfter defeating Pluto, the self-styled \"Champions of Los Angeles\" decided to stick together as a team{{r|Champions #5}}. Their public dedication ceremony turned into disaster when they were attacked by [[John Horton (Earth-616)|Griffin]], [[Boris Bullski (Earth-616)|Titanium Man]] and [[Yuri Petrovich (Earth-616)|Crimson Dynamo]]{{r|Champions #8|9}}. Angel's wealth bankrolled the group, and they bought a surplus [[Avengers Quinjet]], the \"Champjet\", for team usage. Black Widow and Hercules made an abortive attempt at romance, but though it did not last long, neither did it seriously impair their working relationship. The group also worked from time to time with [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Black Goliath,]] who provided scientific expertise in addition to his brawn.{{r|Champions #11}}\n\nDuring their brief tenure as a team, the Champions once fought [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|The Incredible Hulk]], who was, unknown to them, trying to get his injured cousin Jennifer to a hospital for the blood transfusion that would inadvertently turn her into [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]].{{r|Giant-Size Hulk #1}}\n\nIn addition to Black Widow, another Russian heroine joined the team: [[Laynia Petrovna (Earth-616)|Darkstar]] joined after participating in an attempt to capture the Black Widow.{{r|Champions #9|10}}\n\nThe Champions briefly reunited, teaming up with [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] to battle their old foe Pluto{{r|X-Force / Champions Vol 1 '98}}\n\nAfter their dissolution, the Champions became a sometime object of ridicule, with Iceman recalling the team as an embarrassment{{r|Uncanny X-Men #332}}, and Angel calling the team \"a nightmare - we just didn't know what we were doing.\"{{r|Defenders #135}}\n\nDespite this, two recent teams courted the name as their own: the California branch of the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|50-State Initiative]] was originally to be named \"The Champions\", but this was quickly changed to [[The Order (Los Angeles)|\"The Order.\"]]{{r|Civil War #6}}{{r|The Order Vol 2 #1}} Also, the team first known as the [[Great Lakes Initiative (Earth-616)|Great Lakes Avengers]] (also the Lightning Rods and Great Lakes X-Men) changed their name to the unused \"Great Lakes Champions\" during a poker tournament held by [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|The Thing]],{{r|Thing Vol 2 #8}} although they later switched back.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = formerly the \"Champjet\", a surplus [[Avenger's Quinjet|Avengers Quinjet]]\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n\n| Trivia                  = * Originally, writer Tony Isabella wanted the Champions to be a two-man group consisting of former X-Men, Angel and Iceman, but editor Len Wein insisted the team contain at least five members and Isabella added the other previously-established heroes. Another Russian hero, Darkstar, later joined the team. Had the series continued, the team reportedly was to expand to include [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Black Goliath]] in full capacity as well as [[Jonathan Hart (Earth-616)|Jack of Hearts]].\n| Links                   = *[http://www.chronology.net/default.pl/cited/rd_champions Series index]\n*[http://uncannyxmen.net/db/issues/showfaq.asp?fldAuto=210 Issue Summaries]\n*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Champions_(comics) Wikipedia article]\n* http://www.marvel.com/universe/Champions_(of_Los_Angeles)\n}}\n[[Category:Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)/Quotes]]"
