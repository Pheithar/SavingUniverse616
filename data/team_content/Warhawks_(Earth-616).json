The Warhawks were gathered by Ares to fan the flames of war by demonstrating outside of the [[Midtown Hotel]] in New York where [[Midtown Hotel#Wo Tong (Earth-616)|Wo Tong]], a delegate to the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] from a communist country was staying. Ares incited his Warhawks to storm the hotel to assault Wo Tong, and this attracted the attention of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] and the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], who tried to reason with the crowd, but instead fell under the spell of Ares' satyrs.\n\nWarhawks were also dispatched to [[Stark Enterprises Main Plant|Stark Industries]] with one of the satyrs, and they managed to control [[Iron Man (Anthony \"Tony\" Stark)|Iron Man]], and forced him to help design new weapons for Ares. The [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] came to Stark Industries to stop the Warhawks, and battled Iron Man. In the course of their battle, Iron Man blasted Vision in the face with his repulsor rays and struck him so hard that he fell back into the satyr, crushing him to death. With the satyr dead, Iron Man and the Warhawks regained their senses. The Vision, Iron Man and [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] rallied against the Warhawks and their fellow Avengers, but Iron Man fell under the satyrs' spell again as soon as he heard their music.\n\nThe Scarlet Witch managed to separate [[Mjolnir]] from Thor using a hex-sphere, but the timely arrival of [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] set Mjolnir free and Thor's fiery display of power began to shock some of the Warhawks back to their senses. The Vision used this moment to strike, and knocked both of the satyrs unconscious. Ares fled the scene.{{r|Avengers #98}} \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/warhawks.htm\n}}\n[[Category:Satyrs]]\n[[Category:Olympian Organizations]]"
