Tracking down [[Clayton Cortez (Earth-616)|Weapon H]] to [[Drumheller]], [[Alberta]], Mars Team blackmailed him into helping them seek revenge by taking his mother-in-law, [[Janice Sung (Earth-616)|Janice Sung]], hostage. Luring Dark Carnage to an abandoned warehouse, Mars Team attempted to weaken him with anti-[[Symbiotes|symbiote]] weaponry, but were killed one-by-one. Weapon V's head researcher, [[Andrew Breen (Earth-616)|Dr. Andrew Breen]], was driven insane by his study of the symbiotes and betrayed them by freeing Weapon H's mother-in-law. With no reason to help them, Weapon H left them and the remaining members were killed by Dark Carnage.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = Mars Team's members were bonded to [[Symbiotes|suits of symbiote bio-armor]] cloned from samples of the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel symbiote]] taken from the [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|Sym-Soldier Program]] by [[Project Venom (Earth-616)|Weapon V]].{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Mars Team is equipped with a variety of military-grade and anti-symbiote weapons.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * Mars Team's name follows that of the [[Mercury Team (Earth-616)|Mercury Team]], a symbiote super-soldier initiative started by the [[United States Armed Forces (Earth-616)|U.S. Military]], in that it's named after a Roman god or planet.\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Symbiotes-possessed]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]\n[[Category:Weapon Plus Projects]]\n[[Category:Project Venom (Earth-616)/Members]]\n[[Category:Symbiote-Enhanced Organizations]]"
