He used his own technology to create an experimental nucleorganic pacemaker to save his life. Although a success, the nucleorganic pacemaker mutated Darren's body to and gave him superhuman abilities. A side-effect of the mutation was that Darren would quickly overuse and burn out his heart. Multiple heart transplants were performed, but each heart was removed when overused. Desperate, he kidnapped heart surgeon [[Erica Sondheim (Earth-616)|Dr. Erica Sondheim]] to replace his damaged heart. He also kidnapped 'donors' from slums. [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]], also looking for Dr. Sondheim to save the life of his daughter [[Cassandra Lang (Earth-616)|Cassie]], attempted to rescue her. A battle between Darren and Ant-Man resulted in Darren burning out his heart and dying, Sondheim revealing when Ant-Man interrupted the operation she replaced his old heart rather than a new one. The company was then taken over by Darren's son, Augustine.{{r|Marvel Premiere #47}} \n\nCross Technological Enterprises featured at the 24th annual Conclave of Electronics Engineers and Innovators in [[Dallas]], [[Texas (State)|Texas]]. Other organizations at the event include [[Stark Industries]], [[Cordco]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and [[Roxxon]]. When a trio of armored men called the [[Raiders (Earth-616)|Raiders]] attack the convention, Scott Lang tackles them despite having left his [[Ant-Man's Suit]] in New York, with the help of [[Iron Man]], but they manage to escape. At one point [[Augustine Cross (Earth-616)|Augustine Cross]] was thought to be a suspect in an incident where the [[Raiders (Earth-616)|Raiders]] were hired to attack Iron Man, but turned out to be innocent.{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 145}}\n\n===Hawkeye===\n[[William Cross (Earth-616)|Crossfire (William Cross)]] began work on the construction of a new, advanced model of his ultrasonic brainwashing device. He arranged to have certain components constructed at [[Cross Technologies]], a firm founded by his cousin, Darren Cross. Learning that the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avenger]] [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] was employed as a security guard at CTE, Crossfire devised a plan to use Hawkeye, whom he believed to be the weakest of the costumed crime-fighters, as bait to lure other super-phumans into his clutches where he could subject them to his brain-washing machine. To capture Hawkeye, Crossfire hired a trio of costumed criminals: the [[Dean Helm (Earth-616)|Silencer]], [[Elton Healey (Earth-616)|Oddball]], and [[Wendy Conrad (Earth-616)|Bombshell]]. Cross' minions managed to take Hawkeye and his companion [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]] captive, and Crossfire used his ultrasonic weapon to make them fight each other. During this fight, Hawkeye suffered permanent hearing damage. However, Hawkeye eventually escaped and defeated Crossfire and his henchmen. The second machine was destroyed, and Crossfire was arrested and sentenced to prison. His subordinates were rescued by Oddball's brother [[Alvin Healey (Earth-616)|Tenpin]].{{r|Hawkeye #4}}{{r|Avengers #239}}\n\n[[Douglas Arthur Cartland (Earth-616)|Dr. Douglas Cartland]],  Head of Systems Designs was among the scientists brought together to sort through the acquired equipment of [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Dr. Bruce Banner]]. Dr. Cartland accompanied by [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Hank McCoy]], met with [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]] and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. Later, while secretly attempting to learn about technology, Dr. Cartland was attacked by [[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Arnim Zola]]. But was soon rescued by the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Annual #13}}\n\n===Ant-Man Security Solutions===\n\nYears later, Augustine resurfaces in [[Miami]], [[Florida (State)|Florida]] where he begins a campaign of vengeance against [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man (Scott Lang)]], the man he blames for his father's death.{{r|Ant-Man Vol 1 3}}\n\n[[Power Broker (Power Broker, Inc.) (Earth-616)|Power Broker]] of [[Power Broker, Inc. (Earth-616)|Power Broker Inc.]] later visited Darren Cross to help invest in the [[Hench App]] by demonstrating it's abilities by having [[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Whirlwind]] attack Ant-Man. Darren Cross didn't want to pay a lot of money for it causing Power Broker to cancel the demonstration and call off Whirlwind's attack.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 1}}\n\nAfter Darren Cross refused to invest in Hench, Augustine Cross hired [[Samuel Saxon (Earth-616)|Machinesmith]] to hack into Power Broker Inc.'s databases so that Cross Technological Enterprises could steal his algorithm, and use it to create a Hench App knock-off called \"Lackey\".{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 2}}\n\nCross Technological Enterprises' Lackey App debuted where it was used by [[Paul Scheer (Earth-616)|Paul Scheer]] to have [[Jason Cragg (Earth-616)|Voice]] disrupt a basketball game as a way to promote the Lackey App.{{r|Astonishing Ant-Man Vol 1 4}}\n\n==Staff==\n* [[Darren Cross (Earth-616)|Darren Cross]] - Founder, CEO\n* [[Augustine Cross (Earth-616)|Augustine Cross]] - CEO\n* [[Ambrose Connors (Earth-616)|Ambrose Connors]] - Special Project Director\n* [[K.H.
