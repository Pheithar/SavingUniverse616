To prevent the collapse of order and prevent the return of the Tong wars, Lin took leadership of the Black Dragon Tong which Wolverine had rejected.{{r|Wolverine: Manifest Destiny Vol 1 4}}\n\nFive decades later Wolverine returned to Chinatown and was confronted by Lin who tried to kill him.{{r|Wolverine: Manifest Destiny Vol 1 2}} Once again the Black Dragon Tong was defeated but this time Wolverine accepted leadership of the Tongs in San Francisco to prevent a gang war at the urging of the [[Sons of the Tiger (Earth-616)|Sons of the Tiger]].{{r|Wolverine: Manifest Destiny Vol 1 4}}\n\nA faction within the Black Dragon Tong would later align with [[Suwan (Earth-616)|Jade Claw]]. Who had established a narcotics operation in [[Subterranea]], with opium poppy fields, underground greenhouses, and methamphetamine factories. She was going to establish a global narcotics empire and supply all of the drug addicts' needs. Her operation was shut down by Wolverine and allies, who also freed the slave labor that she was using.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 17|19}} \n\nThe [[Han, Chang, Lin, Sun, and Ho Tao-Yu (Earth-616)|Collective Man]] later came to San Francisco and attempted to take over the underworld in Chinatown.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 530}} He temporarily assumed leadership of the Tongs but was defeated by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 532}}. Wolverine later gave up the position of Black Dragon after he for some reason finally realized that he basically became a crime boss by assuming the mantle.{{r|Wolverine Vol 4 19}} The new Black Dragon is now [[Fat Cobra (Earth-616)|Fat Cobra]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 304}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Guns, martial arts weapons\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Chinese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Triads]]"
