Their shaman sought to use him to destroy the Nowek. During the battle the Nowek were aided by [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]] but all sides came together when a dinosaur dispatched the Hulk. The two sides came together in a celebratory feast but neither of the leaders could accept a peace between their two peoples and each poisoned the other tribes' food and water.{{r|Incredible Hulk #454}} \n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Savage Land Tribes]]"
