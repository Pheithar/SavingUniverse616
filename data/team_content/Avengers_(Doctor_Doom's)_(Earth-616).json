After having seen the errors of his ways, Doom planned to redeem himself.\n\nAfter the Avengers disappeared, having being captured by the inverted and evil [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]], Doom tasked [[Valeria Richards (Earth-616)|Valeria Richards]] with the mission to assemble a group of certain available heroes, each having specific skills which could be utilized.\n\nThe new Avengers assembled in Doctor Doom's Castle, and jumped into action when the now-evil [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]] arrived to Latveria to have revenge on Doom.{{r|Avengers World #15}}\n\nThe Avengers fought the Scarlet Witch and saved villagers trapped in the crossfire. 3D Man managed to get hold of the Witch and take her to a machine Doctor Doom had created to specifically canalize her abilities. Soon after being put into the machine, the Scarlet Witch escaped and set out to find Doom, leaving the Avengers behind. After condensing a portion of Scarlet Witch's powers into the device, Valeria informed the heroes their job was done.\n\nDoom planned to use the Scarlet Witch's powers to right all his wrongs, but with only enough power to correct one sin, he chose to bring back [[Cassandra Lang (Earth-616)|Cassie Lang]] to life.{{r|Avengers World #16}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Brunnhilde the Valkyrie]] appeared as part of the team even though she was captured and contained with most of the other Avengers in {{cl|Avengers & X-Men: AXIS Vol 1 5}}.\n* This team isn't officially the Avengers; neither [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doom]] nor [[Valeria Richards (Earth-616)|Valeria]] have the powers to induct people as Avengers. Consequently, [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-616)|Coulson]] and [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Bloodstone]], are not to be counted as Avengers (the other members being already Avengers through other memberships).<ref>[[Tom Brevoort|Tom Brevoort]]'s [http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/post/106557817668/hi-tom-very-grateful-for-your-prompt-answer-about statement]</ref>\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
