However, her enemy [[Damon Mathias (Earth-616)|Rok]] took over the group and trapped her, then hired them out as mercenaries. Eventually, Wild Child investigated Nemesis's disappearance and met up with the Children of the Night, and was captured by Rok. Alpha Flight encountered the Children while searching for Wild Child, but were able to defeat them by blinding them. The current status of the Children of the Night is unknown.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 116|117}}\n\nThe Children of the Night have no super-human powers, but are excellent and vicious fighters. Living underground, they have adjusted to subterranean life with enhanced vision.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 116|117}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
