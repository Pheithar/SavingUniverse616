Their ancient history is mostly a mystery due to conflicting stories from the various tribes, but it is believed that they originated from the Ancient Pueblo Peoples (also known as the Anasazi to the Navajo) who existed in the southwestern United State as early as the 13th Century.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Pueblo People|Wikipedia]]</ref>\n\nPresumably, their history on [[Earth-616]] mirrors that in the real world.\n| History                 = \n===American Frontier===\nDuring the days of the American Frontier, the various existing Pueblo tribes had interactions with the gunslinging heroes of the age, either as friend or foe depending on the tribe and the circumstances of the encounter.\n\nOne such tribe of Pueblos, led by Red Willow had befriended the outlaw hero [[Blaine Colt (Earth-616)|Kid Colt]]. They had asked Kid Colt to help them fight off a tribe of [[Apache Nation|Apaches]] who raided their village every year during harvest time. This time around, the Apaches were armed with guns by an outlaw named Ryker. When Kid Colt helped the Pueblos defend their home, Ryker and his men posed as the [[Manidoog]] known as the [[Black Ogre (Earth-616)|Black Ogre]], whom the Pueblo feared. Kid Colt exposed this hoax, but was shocked when the real Black Ogre appeared and slew Ryker and his remaining men.{{r|Wild Western #27}}\n\n===Modern Age===\nThe various Pueblo tribes still exist to this day.\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [[Wikipedia:Pueblo People|Pueblo People at Wikipedia]]\n}}\n[[Category:Native American Tribes]]"
