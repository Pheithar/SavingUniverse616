Kennedy (Earth-616)|Kennedy]]'s assassination, where they had been betrayed by Silver Fox.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 49}} They were later joined by agents Mastodon and Wraith, and together they clashed against Silver Fox, known as ''Zora de Plata''.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 61}}\n\nAgents Logan, Sabretooth and Wraith were sent on a mission in [[Asia|Southeast Asia]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 61}}\n\nAlso in 1963{{r|Wolverine: Origins Vol 1 7|8}} Romulus C.I.A. scienticists in [[Dallas]], [[Texas (State)|Texas]], experimenting on Logan with [[Carbonadium]] pills;{{r|Wolverine: Origins #6|7}} The whole squad was sent on Team X's last mission in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]; they were ordered to save C.I.A. double agent [[Janice Hollenbeck (Earth-616)|Janice Hollenbeck]] and to stole [[Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (Earth-616)|K.G.B.]]'s [[Carbonadium Synthesizer]], required by soviet super-soldier [[Arkady Rossovich (Earth-616)|Omega Red]];{{r|X-Men Vol 2 5|7}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 60|61}}{{r|Wolverine: Origins #8}} Wraith tried to kill Red with a new weapon, but he survived and Wraith managed to teleport himself away to safety.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 60|61}} In the following years, Omega Red continuously sought out the Team X members, believing they may know of its whereabouts.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 5|7}}\n\nIn 1968, Wolverine was send to kill Soviet's Super-Soldier Cosmonaut [[Epsilon Red (Earth-616)|Epsilon Red]] to keep the Russians from reaching the Moon first.
