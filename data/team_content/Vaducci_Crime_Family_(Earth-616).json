Along with members of the [[Righteous Ones (Earth-616)|Righteous Ones]] biker gang and the [[August Dragon Clan (Earth-616)|August Dragon Clan]], they laid siege to the town and battled the Punisher. When they learned that the state police were coming, the Vaducci men pulled out.{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 63|64}}{{r|Punisher: War Zone Vol 1 25}} \n\nThe boss of the Vaducci family later invited several Mafia dons to a Mafia summit in Nevada, one of which was [[Rosalie Carbone (Earth-616)|Rosalie Carbone]]. The meeting was to divide up the country, but unknown to the Vaducci, Rosalie had her own plans. She hired [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]] to take out the other dons. At the same time, their compound was being assaulted by the vigilante successors to the Punisher, the Carlos new [[Carlos Cruz (Earth-616)|Punisher]] and [[Cord Mather (Earth-616)|Phalanx]]. Bullseye killed nearly all of the other dons except the don of the Vaducci, when the two vigilantes burst into the room. He got out of the room but was then killed by Rosalie.{{r|Punisher Vol 2 102|103}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Crime Families]]\n[[Category:Chuck Dixon/Creator]]\n[[Category:Gary Kwapisz/Creator]]\n[[Category:Italian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Cosa Nostra]]"
