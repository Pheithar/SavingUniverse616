To send a message that they were not be to messed with and were to be respected, they threw a funeral for the recently slain [[Bullseye (Lester) (Earth-616)|Bullseye]], who they considered their friend, ever since he stopped at their bar for a game of pool. When rival bikers arrived to start a war, he killed them with all with cue balls. The funeral was crashed by Daredevil, [[Angela del Toro (Earth-616)|White Tiger]], and the Hand, killing or capturing the gang members.{{r|Shadowland: Bullseye Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Gangs]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
