May you strike down mighty and true!!|[[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]|Dark Avengers Vol 1 2}}\n===Origin===\nThe ramifications of the alien [[Skrulls]]' [[Secret Invasion|secret invasion]] of Earth forced a massive restructuring of the United States' defense network. At the time, the country's primary peace keeping agency was [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], led by civilian industrialist Tony Stark, aka, [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]. Because the Skrulls were able to compromise S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Stark Industries|StarkTech]] technology, it was decided that S.H.I.E.L.D. was no longer an effective organization and Tony Stark was personally held accountable for not preparing adequately for the Skrull invasion. In the wake of this controversy, [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] leader [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] manipulated the U.S. government into allowing him to serve as director of a replacement agency called '''H.A.M.M.E.R.''' Under Osborn's leadership, H.A.M.M.E.R. had administrative control over the entire [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|50-State Initiative]].{{r|Secret Invasion #8}}\n\n===Director Osborn===\n[[file:H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616) from Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 9 001.jpg|thumb|right|280px|H.A.M.M.E.R. Uniforms]]\nAs the director of H.A.M.M.E.R., one of Osborn's first initiatives was to issue warrants, demanding the arrest of former S.H.I.E.L.D. director Tony Stark and deputy director [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]]. Moreover, Osborn wanted access to the database containing the identities of every hero registered under the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. To prevent Osborn from getting his hands on such vital information, Tony Stark took measures to erase all known resources containing this sensitive information, including his own mind.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 #9}}\n\nWhen Stark failed to surrender himself to Osborn, Norman sent contingents of H.A.M.M.E.R. squads to Stark Industries facilities all across the globe with orders to arrest Tony Stark with extreme prejudice. The militant agents caused substantial damage in their efforts to find Stark, often brutalizing Stark Industries' personnel.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 2 #10}}\n\n===Dark Avengers===\nIn an effort to make H.A.M.M.E.R.'s image more palatable to the general public, Osborn reorganized the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], filling their ranks with members of the Thunderbolts. Two previous members of the team who remained on Osborn's Avengers were the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] and [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]], the God of War. Osborn himself donned his own suit of [[Iron Patriot Armor Model 1|armor]] (based upon Stark's designs) and became known as the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Iron Patriot]].{{r|Dark Avengers #1}}\n\nOther super-powered agents employed by H.A.M.M.E.R. included the [[Cleavon Twain (Earth-616)|Headsman]], the [[Ghost (Earth-616)|Ghost]], [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] and [[Yelena Belova (Earth-616)|Yelena Belova]] - the second Black Widow. These agents were instructed to track down and assassinate a particular thorn in Osborn's side - [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]].{{r|Deadpool Vol 4 #7}}\n\n===Siege of Asgard===\nDuring the [[Siege (Event)|siege]] of [[Asgard]], H.A.M.M.E.R. lead the attack on Asgard without U.S. permission. Many H.A.M.M.E.R. agents were killed in the battle and their Helicarrier was damaged by U.S military forces, on orders from the President for treason. Shortly afterward their leader Norman Osborn was finally defeated by the Avengers and H.A.M.M.E.R. was dissolved.\n\n===Return===\nH.A.M.M.E.R. reappeared as a criminal organization under the leadership of [[Deidre Wentworth (Earth-616)|Superia]], but was shut down by the New Avengers.\n\nAfter Norman Osborn escaped from prison along with Superia, they reformed H.A.M.M.E.R. with the alliance of The Hand, A.I.M., and the remnants of Hydra.{{r|New Avengers Vol 2 16.1}}\n\nNorman Osborn was ultimately defeated by the combined efforts of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]]. H.A.M.M.E.R. was disbanded and the remaining agents reinforced Hydra.{{r|Avengers Vol 4 24}}\n\nElements of H.A.M.M.E.R. have joined [[Orchis (Earth-616)|Orchis]].{{r|House of X #1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = None; formerly [[H.A.M.M.E.R.
