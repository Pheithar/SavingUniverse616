It had ties to racist organizations such as the National Front. As the fighting continued, they realized that they needed financing to carry on the fight. Like the other paramilitary groups, they turned to smuggling cocaine for the Colombians and within Belfast itself the drug trade, prostitution, loan-sharking, and porngoraphy. Since the ceasefire, the political conflict mutated into a gang war over territory.{{r|Punisher Vol 6 18}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The Ulster Freedom Fighters were a group with the Ulster Defense Association (an umbrella group of loyalist factions) that carried out attacks and used the name of \"Ulster Freedom Fighters\" so that the UDA would not be named as a terrorist group by the British. By the 21st century, both the UDA and its terrorist arm the UFF were proscribed as terrorist groups by the British.\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Irish Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
