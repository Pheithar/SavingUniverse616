The team originally consisted of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] (\"Mister Fantastic\"), Reed's girlfriend [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Sue Storm]] (the \"Invisible Girl\"), Susan's brother [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Johnny Storm]] (the \"Human Torch\"), and their good friend [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Ben Grimm]] (\"The Thing\"). {{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 1}} Since gaining their powers, the group has stuck together and through many adventures, exploring new frontiers of the universe,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 37}} defeating villains,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 8}} and defending [[Earth]] from intergalactic threats.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 48|50}}\n\nThroughout the years, the group evolved with Reed and Sue getting married,{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 3}} and multiple members coming and going,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 265}}{{r|FF Vol 2 1}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 2}} but the original 4 are still the face of the team.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 2}}\n\nUp until recently, Reed, Susan (now going by Invisible Woman) and their kids were rebuilding the Multiverse after its collapse due to the [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]],{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 9}} but they have since returned and once again taken center stage as some of the most important defenders of the world.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 2}}{{r|Empyre Vol 1 6}}\n\n| HistoryText             = \n<center>''This is an abridged version of Fantastic Four's history. For a complete history see '''[[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)/Expanded History|Fantastic Four's Expanded History]]'''''</center>\n\n===Origin===\nThe brilliant aeronautical engineer [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] inadvertently created the Fantastic Four after deciding to make an unauthorized test flight into space using an experimental faster-than-light rocket named the ''[[Marvel-1]]'' of his own design. Reed's plan was to use the ship to visit an Earth=like planet in a star system 44 lightyears away.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 14}} When Reed's financiers began to lose interest in the project, Reed's girlfriend [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Susan Storm]] and her younger brother [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Johnny]] insisted on joining Reed on the flight. Reed's old friend [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Ben Grimm]] was convinced to pilot the rocket.\n\n[[File:Fantastic Four (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four First Family Vol 1 1 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]\nOnce in space, the rocket passed through a storm of [[Glossary:Cosmic Radiation|cosmic radiation]]. Although prepared for them, the ship was met with an unexpected intensity from the radiation and its shielding couldn't contain it. The craft crashed back down to [[Earth]]. Emerging from the ruins of the spaceship, they discovered the radiation had mutated their bodies and had given them remarkable new abilities. Reed gained the ability to stretch his body and limbs, Johnny was able to fly and become engulfed in flames he could control, and Sue was able to bend light around her body and become invisible. Ben gained incredible strength and durability, but his body was tragically transformed. He now had a muscular orange, rock-like hide.\n\nAll four decided to use their powers to better humanity, and founded the Fantastic Four.{{r|Fantastic Four #1}} Individually they call themselves Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and the Thing. They are not superheroes in the traditional sense, but rather explorers, facing whatever challenges that may arise as a family. The profits from Richards' patents and royalties fund the team's activities.\n\n===The Early Years===\nOperating from [[Central City]], [[California (State)|California]], the first menace the Fantastic Four were called upon to face was the [[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Mole Man]] and his ever changing cadre of monsters and sub-human races from below the Earth.{{r|Fantastic Four #1}} They were soon thrown into conflict with the shape-shifting [[Skrulls]],{{r|Fantastic Four #2}} the first of many alien menaces they would battle in their long careers.\n\nThe team moved to the [[Baxter Building]], their New York headquarters, and established themselves as mainstream superheroes. Falling out with his teammates after a battle with the [[Joshua Ayers (Earth-616)|Miracle Man]],{{r|Fantastic Four #3}} Johnny left the group and encountered the [[World War II]] hero [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor, the Sub-Mariner]] living as an amnesiac in a flop house. Recognizing Namor from comic books, Johnny dropped him into the sea, hoping to restore his memory. The plan worked, but after Namor found [[Atlantis]] in ruins, he declared war on humanity. Johnny rejoined the Fantastic Four and together they drove Namor back into the sea.{{r|Fantastic Four #4}} He remained their rival for awhile, vying for the affection of Sue Storm.{{r|Fantastic Four #9}}\n\nReed's former college rival Victor von Doom returned as [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]]. Doom's attempts at world domination forced the Fantastic Four to face him again and again, making him their deadliest and most persistent adversary.{{r|Fantastic Four #5}}{{r|Fantastic Four #10}}{{r|Fantastic Four #16|17}}{{r|Fantastic Four #23}}{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #2}}{{r|Fantastic Four #39|40}}\n\nDuring a trip to the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], the Fantastic Four battled the [[Ivan Kragoff (Earth-616)|Red Ghost]] and the [[Super-Apes (Earth-616)|Super-Apes]] and made first contact with a [[Watchers|Watcher]], called [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu]].{{r|Fantastic Four #13}} With the aid of [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Ant Man]], they battled Doctor Doom in [[Sub-Atomica]].{{r|Fantastic Four #16}} During a trip to ancient [[Egypt]]'s past, they encountered the Pharaoh [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Rama-Tut]], a time-traveler who would become the man known as [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]].{{r|Fantastic Four #19}} When the Sub-Mariner was reunited with his people, the [[Atlanteans]], the Fantastic Four were caught in the middle of an Atlantean attempt to invade the surface world.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #1}} Other threats from this period included [[Kurrgo (Earth-616)|Kurrgo]]{{r|Fantastic Four #7}}, the [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]],{{r|Fantastic Four #8}}{{r|Fantastic Four #14}} the [[Impossible Man (Earth-616)|Impossible Man]],{{r|Fantastic Four #11}} the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]],{{r|Fantastic Four #12}} the [[Mad Thinker (Julius) (Earth-616)|Mad Thinker]],{{r|Fantastic Four #15}} the [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]],{{r|Fantastic Four #18}} and the [[Owen Reece (Earth-616)|Molecule Man]].{{r|Fantastic Four #20}} [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] made a bid to join the team, but was denied.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #1}}\n\nThey teamed up with [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] to defeat the [[Adolf Hitler (Clone) (Earth-616)|Hate-Monger]],{{r|Fantastic Four #21}} and it was during this time that the Invisible Girl discovered her force-field powers, right before another confrontation with the Mole Man.{{r|Fantastic Four #22}} The Fantastic Four also returned a [[Infant Terrible (Earth-616)|lost alien child]] which was causing mayhem in New York to its parents,{{r|Fantastic Four #24}} and then they teamed up with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] for the first time when the Hulk attacked New York in his most destructive rampage to that date.{{r|Fantastic Four #25|26}} They also met another active super team of the era, the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], for the first time when the schemes of the Puppet Master and the Mad Thinker pitted them against each other.{{r|Fantastic Four #28}}\n\nThree of the Human Torch's enemies, the [[The Wizard (Earth-616)|Wizard]], [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]], and the [[Peter Petruski (Earth-616)|Trapster]], joined forces and recruited an amnesiac [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Medusa]] to form an evil, mirror counterpart to the Fantastic Four. They called themselves [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]], and battled the Fantastic Four on several occasions.{{r|Fantastic Four #36}}{{r|Fantastic Four #38}}{{r|Fantastic Four #41|43}}{{r|Fantastic Four #177}}\n\nDoctor Doom used his Emotion Charger machine to mind control many villains to attack the team on Reed and Sue's wedding day, but with the aid of a device given to him by the Watcher, Reed ended the threat. Sue and Reed finally married. The wedding was attended by the Avengers and most of the world's heroes.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #3}}\n\n===New Friends and Enemies===\nThe Fantastic Four met Medusa's family, the royal family of the hidden race known as the [[Inhumans (Race)|Inhumans]]. Johnny instantly fell in love with Medusa's sister, [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]]. The Inhumans and their king, [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]], were originally distrustful of the Fantastic Four. Tragedy struck when the Inhumans' ancestral home [[Attilan]] was separated from the outside world by a Negative Zone barrier created by Black Bolt's mad brother [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus]]. The Inhumans were trapped inside, and Johnny and Crystal were separated.{{r|Fantastic Four #44|49}}\n\nDespite the Watcher's efforts to hide Earth, [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] came to Earth determined to consume the energy-rich planet. His herald, the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]], rebelled. Reed Richards thwarted Galactus by threatening to use an alien device called the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] on him, a weapon that could lay waste to the universe and kill even Galactus. Galactus was forced to vow to spare Earth in exchange for the Nullifier's return, and he punished the Surfer for his betrayal by erecting an undetectable energy barrier that prevented the Surfer from leaving Earth.{{r|Fantastic Four #48|50}}\n\nThe Fantastic Four were invited to visit the African nation [[Wakanda]] by its king, the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]]. They were attacked by the Black Panther, who easily bested them all in individual combat, but was defeated when they teamed up as a group. With the battle over, the Black Panther revealed that it was all a test of their abilities. They helped the Black Panther drive [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Ulysses Klaw]] out of Wakanda. Thwarted, Klaw leaped into his massive sonic converter device hoping to gain superhuman powers to combat his foes.{{r|Fantastic Four #52|53}} His gamble was successful and Klaw was transformed into a creature whose body was composed of \"living sound\". In his new form, Klaw battled the Fantastic Four and was pummeled into unconsciousness by Mister Fantastic wearing Vibranium knuckle guards and taken to prison.{{r|Fantastic Four #56}}\n\nThe [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|original Human Torch]]'s body was discovered by the Mad Thinker. Using his knowledge of androids, the Thinker restored most of the Torch's original synthetic tissue and nervous system. The Thinker partially restored the android's memories but coerced the Torch into battling the Fantastic Four. On realizing the implications of what the Thinker wanted him to do, the Torch sacrificed his artificial life to save the Fantastic Four from a sneak attack by the Thinker's computer [[Quasi-Motivational Destruct Organism (Earth-616)|Quasimodo]]. The Thinker fled, and the Fantastic Four left the Torch's body in the Thinker's laboratory in Nevada.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #4}}\n\nThe Silver Surfer was befriended and betrayed by Doctor Doom, who imprisoned him and stole the Surfer's power for himself. Doom attacked and defeated the Fantastic Four and held the world in terror, but Doom lost his new might when Reed tricked him into leaving Earth's atmosphere. Doom collided with Galactus' barrier, and the Surfer's powers were restored. Meanwhile, the Inhumans escaped their prison thanks to Black Bolt's scream, however Attilan was left in shambles. The Inhuman Royal family agreed it was time to enter the world of the humans.{{r|Fantastic Four #57|60}}\n\nReed found himself trapped in the [[Negative Zone]] after an attack by the Sandman. At that moment, Crystal and Johnny were reunited, and Crystal enlisted the Inhuman [[Triton (Earth-616)|Triton]] to rescue Reed. [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]], who once ruled [[Baluur]] in the Negative Zone, followed them through a portal. He teamed up with Sandman, but the Fantastic Four and Crystal managed to defeat them and sent Blastaar back to his own dimension.{{r|Fantastic Four #61|63}}\n\nWhile trying to take a vacation on a tropical island, the Fantastic Four encountered the [[Kree]] [[Sentry 459 (Earth-616)|Sentry 459]], who had been reactivated by an [[Daniel Damian (Earth-616)|archaeologist]]. During the fight, Johnny's flame struck the island's energy supply, causing it to explode. The FF and the archaeologist escaped in time, seemingly leaving the Sentry to be destroyed.{{r|Fantastic Four #64}}\n\nA difficult pregnancy for Sue followed, during which Crystal took her place on the team. At the last moment, to save the unborn child, the Fantastic Four had to visit the Negative Zone and borrow the [[Cosmic Control Rod]] of [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]]{{r|Fantastic Four Annual #6}}. Sue's child, [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin]], named after her father, manifested strong and unusual powers almost immediately. When Annihilus kidnapped Franklin to tap those powers, they increased exponentially, and Reed felt he had no choice but to inhibit Franklin's mental activity. Outraged, Sue left Mr. Fantastic and took Franklin with her.{{r|Fantastic Four #130}} During Sue Storm's hiatus, the Inhuman Medusa took her place. The old bonds, though, drew Susan back to the team.{{r|Fantastic Four #149}} When Ben Grimm was transformed into his human self and lost his powers after a battle with the Hulk,{{r|Fantastic Four #167}} he was briefly replaced with [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]].{{r|Fantastic Four #168|169}} He returned to the team using an exoskeleton constructed by Reed that emulated his old powers,{{r|Fantastic Four #170}} but was transformed into his rock form again during a battle with Galactus.{{r|Fantastic Four #175}}\n\n[[File:Fantastic Four Vol 1 525 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Fantastic Four]]\n===Change===\nThe team was transported to the distant \"[[Battleworld (Beyonder)|Battleworld]]\" by the [[Beyonder (Earth-616)|Beyonder]] for the first of the so-called \"[[Marvel Super Heroes: Secret Wars|Secret Wars]].\" On that planet Ben Grimm found himself able to change to human form and back. Concealing his discovery of Grimm's mental block for fear of hurting his feelings, Richards claimed that the nature of the planet itself was somehow responsible for Grimm's ability to transform back and forth. Once the \"Secret War\" was over, Grimm remained on the planet for months. The Thing asked [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] to take his place in the Fantastic Four.{{r|Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars #1|12}}\n\nDuring an extended trip to the Negative Zone, a sort of second honeymoon, Sue conceived another child. This unborn daughter began to give off radiation. Despite the efforts of Mr. Fantastic and several other experts, the girl was apparently stillborn.{{r|Fantastic Four #268}}\n\n[[Psycho-Man (Earth-616)|Psycho-Man]] took advantage of Sue's fragile self-control at this point and amplified her negative emotions. She became Malice, with all of the Invisible Girl's powers but none of her restraint, and attacked the Fantastic Four. Mr. Fantastic helped her throw off Psycho-Man's influence, but she lost control again when the Fantastic Four confronted Psycho-Man; she turned his own Control Box on him, which shorted out his nervous system and nearly killed him. This episode would have lasting effects: the Invisible Girl changed her name to Invisible Woman; she discovered how to use Force Objects, and in the long term, she lost a measure of self-confidence, knowing that Malice still lurked inside her.\n\nJohnny found himself drawn to Alicia Masters, longtime girlfriend of the absent Thing. Johnny and Alicia's romance helped estrange the Thing from the Fantastic Four for a lengthy period.\n\nThe Thing rejoined the Fantastic Four and She-Hulk returned to the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. When Reed and Sue retired from active Fantastic Four duty to focus on raising their son, they left Ben in charge. He recruited Crystal, who was separated from [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] at the time, and [[Sharon Ventura (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel (Sharon Ventura)]] to replace them. Ben served capably as team leader and started a romance with Sharon that deepened after new cosmic radiation exposure further mutated them both, turning Sharon into a sort of \"She-Thing\" and Ben into an even stronger, more hideous spiky-hided Thing. Their romance continued through several more changes of form (with Ben eventually settling back into his classic Thing form), even after Reed and Sue rejoined the group; but they were estranged after Sharon accepted Doctor Doom's aid in regaining human form.\n\nJohnny's old feelings for Crystal slowly returned, but his love for Alicia enabled him to resist temptation, and Crystal eventually left the team. Eventually Johnny married Alicia. Despite their long and intimate relationship, Johnny was horrified to discover that the Alicia he loved and married was not the true Alicia Masters, but a Skrull impostor named [[Lyja (Earth-616)|Lyja]]. Originally sent to infiltrate and destroy the Fantastic Four, Lyja truly fell in love with Johnny, and joined the Fantastic Four in confronting [[Paibok (Earth-616)|Paibok]], the Skrull who had kidnapped the real [[Alicia Masters (Earth-616)|Alicia]]. Lyja seemingly sacrificed her life to protect Johnny, but her former lover Paibok nursed her back to health.\n\nTrying to move on from yet another failed relationship, Johnny enrolled at Empire State University; but [[Devos (Earth-616)|Devos]], Paibok and even Lyja attacked Johnny at ESU, forcing his powers to go nova, burning down a large section of the campus. Johnny briefly became a fugitive until Reed agreed to sell some of his patents to pay for the damages. Lyja returned to Johnny's life again, tricking him into believing she was carrying his baby. When this proved a lie as well, Johnny left her again.\n\n===Psi-Lord===\nClaiming that Franklin's presence in this timeline would lead to destruction, Reed Richards' father Nathaniel abducted the child into the future. Nathaniel raised Franklin for years in the future, training him to be a warrior and to master his superhuman powers. The adolescent Franklin journeyed back in time, arriving in the Fantastic Four's headquarters mere moments after Nathaniel had abducted him as a child. The teenage Franklin called himself [[Franklin Richards (Earth-6311)|Psi-Lord]], and wielded vast psionic powers, although they remained far short of his full potential.\n\nWhen Reed and Doom seemingly died as a result of their conflict with the alien Hunger, they were actually spirited away by the space-time-warping [[Jonathan Richards (Earth-967)|Hyperstorm]], mad son of an alternate-future Franklin Richards. Hyperstorm kept Doom as a tortured captive and trapped Reed in the distant past for months, during which time the world believed both Reed and Doom to be dead. In Reed's absence, Sue took over leadership of the Fantastic Four and served capably in the role, recruiting [[Scott Lang (Earth-616)|Ant-Man (Scott Lang)]] as the team's new scientist. However, she refused to believe Reed was truly dead, and she rebuffed romantic advances from Namor.\n\nDuring this period, Franklin founded the [[Fantastic Force (Earth-616)|Fantastic Force]], a new super-hero team to carry on his father's work of protecting humanity. Finally, after Reed was eventually rescued, Psi-Lord somehow was removed from the Fantastic Four's time and was replaced by the child Franklin, as he had been at the time that Nathaniel had abducted him. Nathaniel claimed that Hyperstorm must have arranged the substitution, and that the Psi-Lord version of Franklin no longer existed in the Fantastic Four's timeline.\n\n===Onslaught===\nWhen Franklin Richards was kidnapped by [[Onslaught (Psychic Entity) (Earth-616)|Onslaught]], the Fantastic Four joined the Avengers and the X-Men to battle Onslaught in Central Park. An enraged Hulk was able to crack open Onslaught's shell. However, Onslaught remained as pure psionic energy, planning to spread across the planet. Thor plunged into Onslaught, trying to contain him. The Fantastic Four, the majority of Avengers, and even Doctor Doom followed. Thanks to this sacrifice, the X-Men finally managed to destroy Onslaught. The Fantastic Four, Doom, and the Avengers were believed dead, but were instead saved by Franklin, who created a pocket dimension called [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Counter-Earth]] to keep them safe. Back on [[Earth-616]], the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] moved into the Fantastic Four's headquarters at [[Four Freedoms Plaza]].\n\n===Heroes Return===\nAfter several months away, the missing heroes returned from Counter-Earth and were reunited with Franklin. They set up their new headquarters at [[Pier Four]].\n\nThey met [[Valeria von Doom (Earth-99315)|Valeria von Doom]], visitor from the future, who claimed to be Sue's daughter by Doctor Doom. She proved to be a key to the defeat of [[Abraxas (Multiverse)|Abraxas]], an entity related to Galactus. Reed banished Abraxas by using the [[Ultimate Nullifier]], which had an unintended consequence: it returned Valeria to Susan's womb in the present. Everyone learned then, with some dismay, that Franklin had saved his unborn sister by sending her into the future, when technology was available to help her survive the pregnancy. With the help of Doctor Doom, the child was delivered safely. As a condition of his service, Doom named the girl after Valeria, the love of his life.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 54}}\n\nLater, Doom exploited his special bond with the young [[Valeria Richards (Earth-616)|Valeria]] to employ her as a mystical familiar, using sorcery to mount one of his most ruthless and terrifying attacks on the Fantastic Four ever. In the end, Doom was taken by his own demonic benefactors, but not before he hideously disfigured Reed's face as a petty parting gesture. Physically and emotionally scarred, Reed led the Fantastic Four into Doom's now-leaderless Latveria, where he worked obsessively to dismantle Doom's regime, neutralize his arsenal, erase Doom's legacy and create a better state, becoming increasingly tyrannical himself in the process and ignoring threats of international criminal charges from the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]]. At the same time, unknown even to his teammates, Reed was secretly plotting to retrieve Doom from Hell and place him in a specially prepared other-dimensional prison from which he could never escape; but this transfer was unwittingly interrupted by the rest of the Fantastic Four, allowing Doom to escape long enough to kill the Thing.\n\nDevastated, the remaining Fantastic Four returned to the [[United States of America]], where their standing with the authorities and their reputation with the general public had taken a terrible beating due to the Latverian controversy. The Fantastic Four broke up, Reed and Sue split up, and Reed was even forced to sign over most of his patents to the government as part of a deal to escape prosecution. However, Reed was certain that Ben could be resurrected, and he convinced Sue and Johnny to join him in this quest, which ultimately led them to the gates of Heaven itself using a modified model of Doom's old afterlife machine. Persuaded it was not yet his time, Ben agreed to return to the land of the living with his friends-and the Creators allowed it, even healing Reed's facial scars as a parting gift. With the Fantastic Four back together, Reed led them in rebuilding their reputations and their finances.\n\n===[[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]]===\n[[File:Fantastic Four Vol 1 544 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fantastic Four: (left to right) Human Torch, Storm, Black Panther, Thing.]]\nThe super-human civil war split the team once again. Johnny was beat into a brief coma during a visit to a nightclub, sparked by anger over the [[Stamford]] disaster. Mr. Fantastic supported the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], while Sue and Johnny joined the resistance. The Thing announced that while he thought the registration was wrong, he was also not going to fight the government and left the country for [[France]].\n\nDuring the final battle,{{r|Civil War #7}} however, Mr. Fantastic shielded Sue from an attack by the [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] and was severely wounded. In the aftermath of the war, Sue and Johnny were granted amnesty. Sue and Reed took a leave from the team to work on their marriage, while the recently married [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] filled in for them.\n\n===[[Secret Invasion]]===\nReed and Sue returned to the Fantastic Four in time for the Skrull invasion. While Sue was on a talking tour in Vancouver, [[Canada]], a Skrull attacked her in her apartment and quickly neutralized her. Meanwhile, Reed and Hank Pym were called in by Tony Stark to study the body of the [[Siri (Skrull) (Earth-616)|Skrull Elektra]] to find out how they became undetectable. When Reed found out, Hank turned into a Skrull and blasted him into goo. While this was happening, the Skrull impersonating Sue walked into the [[Baxter Building]] and opened the portal into the Negative Zone, causing it to consume the Baxter Building, with Johnny, Ben, and the two Richards children inside. The Skrull revealed herself to be Johnny's ex-girlfriend, Lyja the Laserfist, who had been trying to keep them out of harm's way.\n\nAfter dueling with Lyja and learning of the invasion on Earth, Ben, Johnny, Franklin and Val, with the assistance of Lyja, turned to the prison in the Negative Zone to gain the aid of someone to rebuild the portal back to Earth. They sought a man known as the [[Phineas Mason (Earth-616)|Tinkerer]] who refused to help, stating that he was captured, despite being retired, while taking his grandchildren out for ice cream and was not given a fair trial. Franklin pleaded with the man, stating that Dr. Reid, the boy's father, would not support the Tinkerer's arrest had he been aware, begging for his aid. Tinkerer, most likely reminded of his grandchildren, agreed to assist. After hours of waiting, the Tinkerer repaired the technology. Lyja chose to stay behind while the remaining Fantastic Four, the children and the Tinkerer returned to a battle-torn New York City.{{r|Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four #1}}\n\n===[[Dark Reign]]===\nReed created a device called The Bridge to explore alternate realities. Meanwhile, Johnny, Sue, and Ben fought off the agents of H.A.M.M.E.R. <!-- why? -->Reed's machine sent Johnny, Ben and Sue to a different reality where a super hero Civil War was happening sometime in the [[Hyborian Age]]. Reed continued to study parallel worlds where the Civil War ended differently to find the reason his reality had become the way it was while Ben, Sue, and Johnny traveled throughout collapsed space-time. Reed determined that in all the realities that the Registration was successful, he had acted alone without any input from anyone else.\n\nIn the Baxter Building on Earth-616, Franklin and Val prepared to fend off the agents of H.A.M.M.E.R. When Red shut down the Bridge and the others returned, they went outside to find [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] chasing their children with a gun. Norman was trapped in the Baxter Building with a very upset Susan Richards. She put up a force field that locked everyone else out and him in. He pulled a gun and was about to shoot Reed when Franklin shot him first with a toy gun. They ultimately let Norman go, and Sue told Reed to destroy The Bridge. He did so, but then secretly put it back together, and met beings from another reality who told him how he could fix things. Johnny and Ben wondered how Franklin could have actually shot Norman with a toy gun and thought his powers may have returned.\n\nFollowing the [[Siege|Siege of Asgard]], Ben was asked by [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] to become a member of the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]]. Cage assured Ben that he could maintain joint membership with both teams.\n\n===Three===\nWhile Reed and Sue were gone from the Baxter building of their own important missions a group known as the [[Cult of the Negative Zone (Earth-616)|Cult of the Negative Zone]] successfully made their way into the building and breached the portal to the Negative Zone. Once inside the cult had managed to unleash what seemed to be an endless army of Annihilus Insectoid Soldiers upon Johnny, the currently powerless Ben, and the kids of the Future Foundation. Franklin revealed that he had his powers back by destroying the army; and the group pushed into the Negative zone where the only way to hold the army off from getting through the door was to lock the door from their side and randomize the code so no one could get in or out. Ben prepared to make the sacrifice but Johnny threw him through the portal as he regained his powers. The last image of Johnny was him being covered by the Army.\n\n[[File:Fantastic Four Vol 5 1 Ope\u00f1a Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]\n===Return===\nJohnny was revived by Annihilus three times while he participated in the latter's \"gladiator competition\". When Annihilus was planning a new Annihilation Wave to enter Earth, Johnny and the [[Light Brigade (Earth-616)|Light Brigade]] rebelled and took Annihilus prisoner, while the Human Torch, using the [[Cosmic Control Rod]] became the new ruler of the Negative Zone. After helping the [[Future Foundation]] to save Earth from a Kree invasion and the arrival of the Mad Celestials, the Fantastic Four reformed.<ref>In {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man #680}}, Spider-Man mentions the Baxter Building as the home of the Future Foundation and the Fantastic Four, implying they are reformed, also in {{cl|FF #16}} the four main members have a \"4\" in their Future Foundation suits, and in {{cl|Invincible Iron Man #517}}, Tony stark mentions Fantastic Four and the Future Foundation.</ref>\n\n===Voyagers===\n[[File:Fantastic Four (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Vol 4 1 0001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Reed's cells begin degenerating.]]\nAfter finding out that during one of their explorations he developed a sickness which caused the cells of his body to start degenerating, Reed decided to disguise a travel through time and space to find a cure as a family excursion.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 4 1}}\n\nThey discovered their sickness had been caused by an overload of their powers, as the abilities of an [[Earth-13266|alternate reality]] version of  [[Fantastic Four (Earth-13266)|themselves]] had them stripped from them when trying to stop [[Victor von Doom (Earth-13266)|Doctor Doom]], who had conquered their Earth.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 4 13}} After helping their depowered [[Fantastic Four (Earth-TRN379)|counterparts]] from that [[Earth-TRN379|alternate universe]] defeat [[Victor von Doom (Earth-TRN379)|Doom the Annihilating Conqueror]], the Fantastic Four re-stabilized their powers and returned home.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 4 14|16}}\n\n===The Fall of the Fantastic Four===\nAfter a portal to the [[Counter-Earth (Heroes Reborn)|Counter-Earth]] was somehow opened, an invasion of monsters in New York resulted not only in the Human Torch losing his powers,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 2}} but also the Fantastic Four being evicted from the Baxter Building, and the children of the Future Foundation being taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 5}}\n\nSoon after finding out years ago Johnny had ruined an opportunity for becoming normal, The Thing was arrested after being found next to the corpse of the Puppet Master.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 7}} Additionally, Sue started becoming more violent,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 9}} Johnny lost track on his life,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 10}} and Reed started becoming erratic.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 12}} After concluding that somebody was behind their misfortune, the Fantastic Four decided to go to the bottom of it, and find Reed, who had recently disappeared, actually having being kidnapped by the man pulling the strings, the villain known as the [[Quiet Man (Earth-616)|Quiet Man]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 13}}\n\nThe Fantastic Four were reunited when Johnny was brought to his senses,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 12}} he and Sue helped free The Thing from the [[Power House]],{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 5 13}} and Reed escaped from the Quiet Man.{{r|Fantastic Four #643}} While the Quiet Man unleashed an invasion of creatures from the Counter-Earth, the FF enlisted the help of the [[Sleepwalker (Earth-616)|Sleepwalker]] in order to find the source of the monstrosities that came from it by exploring Franklin's subconsciousness, who was revealed to be the [[Psycho-Man (Earth-616)|Psycho-Man]].{{r|Fantastic Four #644}} \n\nBack in his headquarters, the Quiet Man tried to activate the code that would shut off the portals from the Counter-Earth and render the invading forces inert, to make himself look like the hero, however, the Psycho-Man had betrayed him and created a defense wall so he could then control both the Counter-Earth and the Earth with his monstrous army. Mister Fantastic and Valeria came with a solution to finally shut down the creatures and save the world, meanwhile, as he was helping his allies escape from the Counter-Earth, Johnny recovered his powers due to the resulting radiation caused by the closing of one of the portals.{{r|Fantastic Four #645}}\n\n===[[Secret Wars (2015 Event)|Secret Wars]]===\nIn light of the imminent destruction of the Multiverse due to the phenomena known as [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]], the Fantastic Four and the Future Foundation began working on vessels capable of surviving the death of everything.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2015 #Secret Wars}} When the final incursion took place between Earth-616 and Earth-1610, Mister Fantastic gathered every person he could, put them in the life raft, and deployed its measures. When the vessel approached the central point of the incursion, it suffered a hull breach that led to the death of the Fantastic Four and the Future Foundation, leaving Mister Fantastic the sole member of the Fantastic Four.{{r|Secret Wars #1}}\n\nWhen Reed acquired omnipotent power from Doctor Doom, he brought his family back to life and set out to restore the entire Multiverse.{{r|Secret Wars Vol 1 9}} Reed realized that Victor would eternally resent him, and decided to alter his memories to make him believe he was dead, hoping Victor would walk a righteous path if he no longer pursued ultimate power and believed his greatest rival to be gone. Reed also altered the memories of the Human Torch and The Thing, leaving them both behind on the restored Earth-616 to keep Victor in check.{{r|Marvel 2-In-One Annual Vol 1 1}} Since Ben and Johnny believed the rest of their family to be dead, the Fantastic Four were disbanded.{{r|Marvel 2-In-One Vol 1 1}} Ben joined the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] and Johnny Storm acted as both ambassador to the Inhumans and a member of the [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Squad]].\n\nA makeshift Fantastic Four was formed when The Thing and the Human Torch joined with [[Lunella Lafayette (Earth-616)|Moon Girl]] and [[Devil Dinosaur (Earth-78411)|Devil Dinosaur]] to stop the Super-Skrull from allowing [[Omnipotentis (Multiverse)|Omnipotentis]] to enter the Prime Marvel Universe.{{r|Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 29}} After the threat passed, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur left the team.{{r|Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 30}} After discovering a device called the [[Multisect]], The Thing convinced the Human Torch to go explore the Multiverse.

At this moment the team was confronted by an abstract entity called the [[Griever at the End of All Things (Multiverse)|Griever at the End of All Things]] who repudiated their mission of creating new universes. She caused the collapse of the hundreds of universes charted by the Future Foundation, forcing the team to make a final stand. The Fantastic Four were reunited when Mister Fantastic tricked the Griever into giving them the chance to summon the remaining members of the Fantastic Four for backup. In addition to teleporting Ben and Johnny, Reed also brought every super hero who had been part of the team in order to defeat the new foe.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 2}} With his allies, Reed destroyed the Griever's teleporters, forcing her to retreat or risk being stranded in the reality where they were fighting.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 3}} While the Future Foundation continued to explore the Multiverse to restore the Molecule Man, who had been slain by the Griever, the core Fantastic Four returned with Valeria and Franklin to Earth, where only months had passed since the Foundation's years-long journey.

However, after Ben and Johnny saw that the casino was forcing a Kree boy, [[Jo-Venn (Earth-616)|Jo-Venn]], and a Skrull girl, [[N'Kalla (Earth-616)|N'Kalla]], to fight to the death for the spectators' amusement, they tried to rescue the two children by entering the arena. Meanwhile, Reed faced the [[Profiteer (Earth-616)|Profiteer]] to stop this carnage and also send his wife, Sue, to help their kids, Valeria and Franklin, at the casino games. After Reed destroyed the Profiteer's panel control, which allowed Ben and Johnny to save the alien kids, Valeria and Franklin, having won the entire casino, made a deal with the Profiteer to let them go with the necessary things to go back home in exchange for the casino.

Upon entering however, Super-Skrull was able to detect them blowing their cover. The Fantastic Four were shocked to find Earth hero [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]] as the leader of united Kree/Skrull empire. They tried to solve the issue by diplomacy, but the Avengers soon attacked the Alliance's armada and overloaded their computer system allowing the [[Cotati]] to attack the aliens and the Fantastic Four, much to the dismay of the Avengers.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 1}} After [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] combined her powers with Hulkling's [[Excelsior (Star-Sword)|Excelsior]] to remove the Cotati infection, the Fantastic Four split up in order to cover more ground as the Cotati's [[Empyre (Earth-616)|Empyre]] began invading Earth.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 2}}\n\nReed Richards assisted Tony Stark in planning their next move in [[Avengers Mountain]], Invisible Woman and Thing joined [[Hulk (Cotati) (Earth-616)|\"She-Hulk\"]] and Mantis in pursuing [[Sequoia (Earth-616)|Quoi]], while Human Torch remained behind at the Alliance's mothership.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 3}} The situation then began escalading, [[R'Klll (Earth-616)|R'Klll]], posing as her grandson Hulkling, ordered the launching of the [[Pyre (Item)|Pyre]], and Sequoia finally arrived at the Vibranium Mound where he would become a god.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 4}} Human Torch, Captain Marvel, Wiccan and Hulkling tried to stop R'Klll, while Invisible Woman and Mantis tried to fight off the Cotati who had been possessing She-Hulk's corpse and was beating the Thing to death.{{r|Empyre Vol 1 5}} After R'Klll was defeated, Human Torch helped in deactivating the Pyre, and meanwhile Invisible Woman and Thing defeated the Cotati Hulk.
