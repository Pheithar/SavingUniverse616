They were allied with the demon [[Shelob (Earth-616)|Shelob]] and were the biggest heroin dealers in the area. Working with Shelob they planned to use [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Blaze]]'s Hellfire shotgun to kill the heavenly being (Uri-El) whom they had imprisoned in a box.\n\nThe gang encountered and clashed with both Blaze and the Punisher, and in their final confrontation, when Uri-El escaped the box, it was shot by Blaze who thought it a threat. The gang was finally destroyed by Blaze, who used Uri-El's sword to deliver the final blow.{{r|Blaze Vol 1 10|12}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Gangs]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Vampires]]"
