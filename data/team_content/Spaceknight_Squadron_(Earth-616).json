Each member was one of the 1,000 volunteers that sacrificed their humanity to become cyborg warriors in [[Galador]]'s last desperate defense against the [[Dire Wraiths]] invasion fleet. The unit was later dispatched by Galador's [[Prime Director (Earth-616)|Prime Director]] to locate the missing [[Rom (Earth-616)|Rom]].{{r|Rom Annual Vol 1 2}} The Squadron followed the trail of wrecked Wraith [[Drakillar]]'s to [[Wraithworld]]. On the surface, they found Rom entranced by Wraith illusions and [[Unam (Earth-616)|Unam]] was able to finally free him from the delusion.{{Citation}}\n\nRom would later rescue [[Tarm (Earth-616)|Tarm]] and [[Skera (Earth-616)|Skera]] from the living planet [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego]] on his return trek to find Galador. The trio would next encounter Unam and then aid [[Vola (Earth-616)|Vola]] in deposing the now renegade [[Raak (Earth-616)|Raak]] whom Rom neutralized and banished to Limbo with his Dire Wraith allies.  They would all soon after become prisoners of [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]] of the [[Shi'ar]] empire in answer to crimes supposedly committed by [[Plor (Earth-616)|Plor]]. They later find out the fate of the real Plor when [[Tyreseus (Earth-616)|Tyreseus]], who had usurped the Pulsar armor from the dying Plor, is confronted by the Spaceknights and the [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]]. Tyreseus is slain and Gladiator uses the Shi'ar Stargate to send the Spaceknights home to Galador.{{Citation}}\n\nUpon their arrival on the homeworld, they find Galador ravaged by civil war between a new [[Spaceknights (Second Generation) (Earth-616)|Second Generation Spaceknights]] that turned renegade and the human resistance. A battle ensues and many renegade Spaceknights are slain along with the remaining humans on Galador with the exception of the recently arrived [[Brandy Clark (Earth-616)|Brandy Clark]]. Rom creates a final diversion allowing them to escape to the catacombs beneath the surface where Brandy tells them of what she has learned of Galador's fate. Together, they plan to assault the Dark Tower (the bastion of the renegades) and send out a homing signal for the remainder of Galador's lost First Generation Spaceknights to follow to their lost homeworld. In the final assault Rom confronts the renegades leader, [[Dominor (Earth-616)|Lord Dominor]] in single combat while the Spaceknight Squadron battles the remaining renegades allowing Skera enough time to send out the signal. Soon after, all the Spaceknight Squadron members are slain by the renegades.{{r|Rom Vol 1 75}}\n\n==Members==\n* [[Vola (Earth-616)|Vola (Trapper)]]- deceased\n* [[Raak (Earth-616)|Raak (Breaker)]]- Neutralized & banished to Limbo\n* [[Unam (Earth-616)|Unam (Unseen)]]- deceased\n* [[Tarm (Earth-616)|Tarm (Seeker)]]- deceased\n* [[Skera (Earth-616)|Skera (Scanner)]]- deceased\n* [[Plor (Earth-616)|Plor (Pulsar)]]- deceased\n\n| Equipment               = Galadorian plandanium armor\n| Transportation          = Galadorian Stardrive Rocket Pods\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n--[[User:WizArtist|WizArtist]] 05:36, March 19, 2011 (UTC)\n[[Category:Galadorian Organizations]]"
