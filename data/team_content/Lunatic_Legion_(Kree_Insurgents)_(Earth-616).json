They had two primary goals: first, they wanted to overthrow the [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]] and secondly was the death of the Kree hero [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Mar-Vell]], who was a pink-skinned Kree. The group operated initially from the [[Blue Area of the Moon]].{{r|Captain Marvel #37|38}}\n\n===Nitro===\nThe Legion experimented on a [[human]] by the name of [[Robert Hunter (Earth-616)|Robert Hunter]] and turned him into [[Nitro]] the \"Living Bomb\" and sent him on a mission to steal the highly lethal [[Compound 13]], a nerve gas capable of causing huge amounts of destruction and death.{{r|Captain Marvel #34}} This resulted in the fateful battle between Nitro and Mar-Vell that led to Captain Mar-Vell's cancer,{{r|Captain Marvel #35}} which would be ultimately his demise.{{r|Death of Captain Marvel Vol 1 1}} Later, they sent the two androids named [[Living Laser (Android) (Earth-616)|Living Laser]] and [[Nimrod the Hunter (Earth-616)|Nimrod the Hunter]], to kill Captain Marvel and [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]]. They were both fairly easily destroyed by [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|The Wasp]] and Captain Marvel respectively.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 35}}{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 37}}\n\n===Defeat===\nUnable to defeat the Earth's protector, the Legion fled back to their home planet [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]] where they were summoned to an audience with the Supreme Intelligence. The Intelligence proposed an alliance with them to eliminate Captain Mar-Vell, though the real purpose of this was to pit the Legion into a battle they could not win against Captain Mar-Vell. The plan worked, and the Legion was defeated.{{r|Captain Marvel #41}}\n\n| Equipment               = {{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 6}}\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/lunaticlegionzarek.htm\n}}\n[[Category:Kree Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
