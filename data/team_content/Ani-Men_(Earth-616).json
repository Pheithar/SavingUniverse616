Their original line-up consisted of [[Francois Le Blanc (Earth-616)|Frog-Man]], [[Townshend Horgan (Earth-616)|Cat-Man]], [[Henry Hawk (Earth-616)|Bird-Man]], and [[Gordon Keefer (Earth-616)|Ape-Man]], informally known collectively as \"The Organization\".{{r|Daredevil #10}} They were defeated by [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]]{{r|Daredevil #11}} who later fought them on other occasions, during which the team operated without Frog-Man as \"The [[Unholy Three]]\". \n\nIn his bid to take control of NORAD, Count Nefaria returned Frog-Man to the team along with a new female member, [[Veronica Dultry (Earth-616)|Dragonfly]], and empowered them all with super powers. Now known as the Ani-Men, they succeeded in taking over the military base for Nefaria, only to be decisively defeated by the new team of [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].{{r|X-Men #94|95}}\n\nAlthough losing Dragonfly, who was confined to [[Moira Kinross|Moira MacTaggert]]'s mutant research facility in Scotland, the four original Ani-Men continued working for Count Nefaria. During a battle against [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], however, they were all apparently slain with a bomb set by [[Spymaster]].{{r|Iron Man #116}}\n\n===Second Line-Up===\nA second line-up of Ani-Men, who actually referred to themselves as the Unholy Three as well, consisted of [[Roy McVey (Earth-616)|Ape-Man]], [[Achille DiBacco (Earth-616)|Bird-Man]], and [[Sebastian Patane (Earth-616)|Cat-Man]].  Recruited by [[Death-Stalker]], for whom the original Unholy Three has worked for under a previous alias, they also fought Daredevil. Ape-Man and Cat-Man were later slain by Death-Stalker; Bird-Man escaped this fate, having already been captured, but was subsequently slain by [[Scourge (Delazny) (Earth-616)|Scourge]] in the \"Bar with No Name\" massacre in Ohio (he has since been resurrected by the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]]).{{r|Punisher Vol 8 #5}}\n\n===Third Line-Up===\nThe third (and current) line-up consists of [[Giraffe-Man (Earth-616)|Giraffe-Man]], [[Great Horned Owl-Man (Earth-616)|Great Horned Owl-Man]], [[Pig-Man (Earth-616)|Pig-Man]], and [[Rabbit-Woman (Earth-616)|Rabbit-Woman]]. In their only known appearance they attacked a modeling convention in [[Milwaukee]] citing animal rights issues as their motive. They blamed the modeling industry for everything from animal testing of cosmetics to the wearing of furs. The [[Great Lakes Avengers]] showed up on the scene to fight the Ani-Men, but were beating to it by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]\nwho quickly dispatched the criminals.{{r|G.L.A. Vol 1 1}}\n\nTheir current whereabouts are unknown.\n\n===Fourth Lineup===\nLater, a new group of criminals surfaced wearing the Ani-Men costumes of Ape-Man, Cat-Man, and Frog-Man and robbed an armored car.{{r|Code of Honor #3}}\n\nThen, during the [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], A new Bird-Man, Ape-Man, and Cat-Man were amongst the criminals seen recruited by [[Hammerhead]].{{r|Civil War: War Crimes #1}}{{r|Iron Manual Mark 3 #1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = The Ani-Men should not be confused with the [[Animen (Earth-616)|Animen]], a group of [[New Men]] sent by the [[High Evolutionary]] to sabotage one of the [[Miles Warren (Earth-616)|Jackal]]'s labs.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/animendd.htm Ani-Men on Marvunapp]\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/animencwwc.htm]\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/animends.htm]\n}}"
