After getting his hands on the technology to produce [[Adrenaline Pills|Nuke Pills]],{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 12}} President Duarte got these soldiers to work for him, transforming them into the Nuke Platoon,{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 13}} with which he declared war on the mutant population of his country.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 12}}\n\nAn inhabitant of one of the villages ravaged by the Nuke Platoon, [[Carlos Santiago (Acero) (Earth-616)|Acero]], sought help from [[Weapon X-Force (Earth-616)|Weapon X]]. This group of mutants liberated the innocents captured and scheduled for execution and confronted the Nuke Platoon at their base. While being cornered by soldiers, [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] stumbled upon the pills factory, and a cell holding the original [[Frank Simpson (Earth-616)|Nuke]], who hadn't bent to Duarte.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 12}} Sabretooth liberated Nuke and provided him with pills to face the rest of the patrol. However, Nuke soon turned against Weapon X due to his schizophrenia making him believe the mutants were after his pills as well, and even joined forces with Duarte's soldiers.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 13}}\n\nWeapon X managed to hold the line against the Nuke Platoon by taking some pills themselves, and were even assisted by the mutant villagers they had liberated. Close to the battle's end, [[James Howlett (Earth-21923)|Logan]] used explosives to destroy the supply of pills, and [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]] made Nuke come back to his senses. The surviving members of the Nuke Platoon were subdued, and forced to march on the streets of Santo Marco with the mutant villagers as they challenged Duarte's reign.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 14}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
