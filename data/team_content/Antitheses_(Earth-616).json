Each one of them was the polar opposite of one of the heroes: [[Evangelist (Earth-616)|The Evangelist]] was [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]]'s, [[Encephalon (Earth-616)|Enchephalon]] was [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]]'s, [[X-666 (Earth-616)|X-666]] was [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]]'s, and [[Ichor (Earth-616)|Ichor]] was [[Alejandra Jones (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]]'s.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 2 13}}-[[Venom Vol 2 13.1|13.1]]}}\n\nAfter easily defeating Ichor,{{r|Venom Vol 2 13.1}} Ghost Rider attacked [[Gari Oyle (Earth-616)|Gari Oyle]] before she could find and destroy the magical amulet [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Johnny Blaze]] put on the city limits to prevent Hell's corruption from spreading any further, prompting Blackheart to send the remaining Antitheses after her. Agent Venom and Red Hulk, having recovered from their encounters with their antitheses, arrived soon afterwards and killed X-666. The Evangelist then killed the Red Hulk while Encephalon dealt a death blow to the Ghost Rider, who used what little time she still had alive to escape from there. Alone, Agent Venom took on the two remaining Antitheses and managed to kill them.{{r|Venom Vol 2 13.2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]"
