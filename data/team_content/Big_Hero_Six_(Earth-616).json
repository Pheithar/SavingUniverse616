Despite reservations by some members of the Giri, [[Keniuchio Harada (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]], a freelance ronin and former bodyguard of the terrorist Viper, was appointed as field commander of the group. Secret agent [[Aiko Miyazaki (Earth-616)|Honey Lemon]], inventor of the nanotechnology-based Power Purse from which she could access any object, also agreed to join the team. The tough-talking [[Leiko Tanaka (Earth-616)|Gogo Tomago]], able to transubstantiate her body into a fiery force blast by uttering her code-name, was released from prison on the condition that she serve on the team. The Machiavellian bureaucrat known only as Mr. Oshima was appointed as the Giri's spokesperson and coordinated Big Hero 6's activities.\n\nGovernment scientists next identified smart boy genius [[Hiro Takachiho (Earth-616)|Hiro Takachiho]] as a potential operative. Unimpressed with the Silver Samurai, Hiro declined joining the team until his mother was kidnapped by the Everwraith, the astral embodiment of all those killed in the 1945 nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and [[Nagasaki]].{{r|Sunfire and Big Hero Six #1}} Joined by [[Baymax (Earth-616)|Baymax]], a synthetic bodyguard capable of synth-forming into a dragon which was created by Hiro using the brain engrams of his dead father, Hiro reluctantly joined forces with Big Hero 6 to prevent [[Everwraith (Earth-616)|Everwraith]] from slaughtering millions in downtown Tokyo.{{r|Sunfire and Big Hero Six #2}} During the battle, Big Hero 6 was joined by Sunfire, Japan's premiere super hero and a mutant with the ability to super-heat matter into plasma, who was instrumental in the Everwraith's defeat.{{r|Sunfire and Big Hero Six #3}}\n\nSoon after, Big Hero 6 moved their headquarters from the Giri Office Building to Japan's Cool World Amusement Park, where they were attacked by [[X (Monster) (Earth-616)|X the Unknowable]], a monster born from a child's drawings that could transform its atomic structure into any form and shape. With the help of Alpha Flight, Big Hero 6 destroyed X the Unknowable in the fires of Mount Fuji.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 2 #17}} Afterwards, Big Hero 6 continued to protect Japan from all threats, such as when the team rescued Tokyo residents from a freak blizzard caused by the [[Justine Hammer (Earth-616)|Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)]] and her [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]].{{r|Thunderbolts #25}}\n\nEventually, [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]] left Big Hero 6 so that he could work at Charles Xavier's X-Corporation office in Mumbai, [[India]]. His spot on the team was filled by [[Lumina (Earth-616)|Sunpyre]], a young woman with similar solar-based powers who was pulled into this reality through the Power Purse and came to worship Honey Lemon as her own personal god. Similarly, after Silver Samurai was seemingly slain in an altercation with the assassin [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]] in [[Iraq]], his spot on the team was filled by the enigmatic [[Kioshi Keishicho (Earth-616)|Ebon Samurai]]. With the two most experienced members of Big Hero 6 gone, Hiro became the team's new leader.\n\nThe members of Big Hero 6 fell victim to a mind-control device implanted within Baymax. Traveling to [[Canada]], the mind-controlled super heroes attacked a new incarnation of [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] at a national park. After a brief battle, the mind-control device was short-circuited and the two teams parted as friends. Big Hero 6 returned to Japan to seek out the parties responsible for their mind-control.\n\n===New Big Hero Six===\nAfter the super-human [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], instead of forcing heroes to join the [[Japan Defense Agency (Earth-616)|Japan Defense Agency]], the Japanese government preferred to established a voluntary public partnership: the Big Hero Six, including [[SJ3RX (Earth-616)|Red Ronin]] and [[Otomo (Earth-616)|Otomo]].{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report Vol 1 1}}\n\nBaymax and Hiro join the new Big Hero Six with new members [[Wasabi-No-Ginger]] and [[Fred (Fredzilla) (Earth-616)|Fred]].{{r|Big Hero 6: Brave New Heroes #1}} Together they battle [[Brute (Criminal Program) (Earth-616)|Brute]], [[Gunsmith (Criminal Program) (Earth-616)|Gunsmith]] and [[Whiplash (Criminal Program) (Earth-616)|Whiplash]].{{r|Big Hero 6 #1}} Working together they battle [[Badgal (Earth-616)|Badgal]].{{r|Big Hero 6 #2}}{{r|Big Hero 6 #3}}{{r|Big Hero 6 #4}}{{r|Big Hero 6 #5}}\n\n===Ends of Earth===\n[[Spider-Man]] rallied many of Earth's heroes including the Big Hero 6 to help stop the construction of [[Doctor Octopus]]' satellites, which the villain would have used to accelerate global warming.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #685}} Big Hero 6 found one of the facilities, and discovered that it was being guarded by Everwraith. Despite a tough battle, Big Hero 6 finally ended up victorious.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth #1}}\n\n===Original Sin===\nDespite still being considered Japan's premiere superhero team, [[Ryoko Sabuki (Earth-616)|Radiance]] was stated to be more popular than them or Sunfire.{{r|All-New Invaders #6}} Big Hero Six were later confirmed to be engaged in a battle with the [[Jade-Gang-Stars (Earth-616)|Jade-Gang-Stars]] on the dark side of the moon when [[Dagora (Earth-616)|Great Lord Dagora]] began attacking Tokyo, prompting Radiance and [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Jim Hammond]] to team up to protect the city.{{r|All-New Invaders #7}}\n\n| Equipment               =\n* '''[[Go-Go Tomago's Battlesuit]]'''\n* '''[[Power Purse]]'''\n* '''[[Hiro's Battlesuit]]'''\n| Transportation          =\n| Weapons                 = Big Hero Six members' arsenal{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Teams 2005 Vol 1 1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 1}}{{r|Heroic Age: Heroes Vol 1 1}}{{r|Marvel: Your Universe Saga Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Notes                   = * Big Hero Six was created by [[Steve Seagle]] and [[Duncan Rouleau]] and were set to appear in their volume of [[Alpha Flight Vol 2|Alpha Flight]].
