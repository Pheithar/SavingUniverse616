When the pilgrims who traveled to this land entered in conflict with the native beasts that lived on it, the [[Glossary:Originators|Originators]], the heroes that rose among the humans were ascended to gods on faith. These gods, the Orisha, were [[Thoth (Earth-616)|Thoth]], [[Kokou (Earth-616)|Kokou]], [[Mujaji (Earth-616)|Mujaji]], [[Ptah (Earth-616)|Ptah]], [[Nyami (Orisha) (Earth-616)|Nyami]] and [[Bast (Earth-616)|Bast]]. The humans and the Orisha defeated the originators and banished them to the [[Nether-Realms]] beyond a group of gates. As part of their duty, the Orisha became guardians of these gates.{{r|Black Panther #167}}\n\n===Modern Era===\n====Schism====\nAfter the attack led by [[Tetu (Earth-616)|Tetu]]'s [[People (Earth-616)|army]] on [[Birnin Zana (Earth)|Birnin Zana]], [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|T'Challa]] wondered where the Gods had been in those times of trouble, and started to investigate on the matter.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 13}}\n\nIn [[Kinamasi]], a faction of protesters abandoned their worship to the Orishas and preached the coming of a new god, [[Adversary (Earth-616)|Sefako]]. [[Yao (Wakandan) (Earth-616)|Counselor Yao]] of Kinamasi was certain that a schism was brewing.{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 16}} Others in Wakanda, such as in the [[Alkama Fields]] chose, on her return, to worship [[Hadari Yao]] (the \"[[Walker of Clouds]]\" in the old Alkamite tongue), the Goddess who preserves the balance of all natural things: [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], for her to defeat the [[Anansi (Race)|Anansi]], man-spiders of myth and legend. Once the Anansi were repelled, Ororo used the belief in her from the Alkamites to once again inspire confidence in their king and country,{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 17}} ultimately ascending to godhood herself.{{r|Black Panther #172}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Both {{cl|Black Panther Vol 6 13}} and {{cl|Black Panther Vol 6 15|#15}} depict the Orishas of Wakanda as a group of five including [[Thoth (Earth-616)|Thoth]], [[Bast (Earth-616)|Bast]], [[Kokou (Earth-616)|Kokou]], [[Mujaji (Earth-616)|Mujaji]] and [[Ptah (Earth-616)|Ptah]]. Yet, in {{cl|Black Panther Vol 6 15|#15}}, [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|T'Challa]] mentions [[Nyami (Orisha) (Earth-616)|Nyami]], who could be Nyame, another name of [[Vod\u016b]] [[Sky Father]] [[Buluku (Earth-616)|Buluku]].\n* The previously introduced Orishas are part of the [[Ennead]] ([[Bast (Earth-616)|Bast]] and [[Ptah (Earth-616)|Ptah]]) and related gods ([[Thoth (Earth-616)|Thoth]]), forming the [[Gods of Egypt (Earth-616)|Gods]] of [[Egypt]], and not of the \"classical\" Orishas of [[Africa]], the [[Vod\u016b]].\n* Others first appeared as Gods of Wakanda, and haven't been confirmed as any known groups, though they are inspired by beings from [[Earth-1218|our reality]]'s [[Africa]]n mythologies, such as:\n** [[Wikipedia:Kokou_(orisha)|Kokou]] is a \"warrior [[Wikipedia:Orisha|Undergod]]\" for the [[Wikipedia:Yoruba religion|Yoruba faith]] of [[Benin]].{{r|[[Wikipedia:Kokou_(orisha)|Kokou (orisha) at Wikipedia]]}}\n** the [[Wikipedia:Rain Queen|Modjadji]] are \"rain queens\" from the [[Wikipedia:Lobedu people|Balobedu]]'s mythology.{{r|[http://www.mythencyclopedia.com/Mi-Ni/Mujaji.html Mujaji at Myth Encyclopedia]}}{{r|[[Wikipedia:Rain Queen|Rain Queen at Wikipedia]]}}\n<!--* Part of the Orisha of Wakanda are Ennead (Bast, Ptah) or related (Thoth).
