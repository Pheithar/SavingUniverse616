Among their criminal activities was a protection racket and it was as a recently established unified gang that they soon had a confrontation with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 184}} Decades later, they would join the coalition of Chinese gangs that made up [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mister Negative]]'s Chinatown syndicate after he killed some of the White Dragon's men and then corrupted him to his side via use of his powers.{{r|Dark Reign: Mister Negative Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = The separation between the Dragon Lords and the Snakeheads is quite unclear: [[Yana Li (Earth-616)|Yana Li]] seems to consider them as a same organization, but stating on the different declarations, they seems to be associates.{{r|Dark Reign: Mister Negative Vol 1 1|3}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Chinese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Triads]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]"
