His wife sold her last son [[Malekith (Earth-616)|Malekith]] sold to the [[Undertakers Elves of the Southern Swamps (Earth-616)|Undertakers Elves]] of the [[Southern Swamps]] on the nineteenth years of the war, in exchange for food to her [[Hounds of the Hunter (Earth-616)|hounds of the Wild Hunt]], for him to become a corpse burner instead of a soldier.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #25}}\n\nMalekith grew grim in doing his labor, was captured by the [[Rock Trolls (Orange-Skinned)|Trolls]] met a wizard who trained him, and whom he killed when he asked Malekith to help him defeat war (as war defined the young Malekith).{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #25}}\n\nBefore dying, the wizard marked Malekith, with half of his face black. Malekith then returned to his mother, took control of the Wild Hunt and had them eat her.{{r|Thor: God of Thunder #25}}\n| Equipment               = [[Hounds of the Hunter (Earth-616)|Wild Hunt]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Dark Elf Tribes and Clans]]"
