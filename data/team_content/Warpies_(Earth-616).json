Their exogenetic mutations caused them to suffer, die young, sometimes during spectacular explosions. Also, they give them super-human abilities and/or unusual morphology.{{r|Astonishing X-Men: Xenogenesis Vol 1}}\n\nThey were named '''Warpies''' by the [[Resources Control Executive (Earth-616)|R.C.X.]] because of their relations with Jaspers reality manipulation, commonly named as [[Jaspers Warp]].\n\n===Sent to [[Braddock Manor]]===\n[[File:Warpie Kids (Earth-616) 04 from Captain Britain Vol 2 8 0001.jpg|thumb|left|325px]]\n\nThe Warpies were discovered in London, and were one by one taken from their families to a vast prison where some of them were turned into government agents or simply studied, away from the public.\n\n[[File:Warpies (Earth-616) from Captain Britain Vol 2 14 001.jpg |thumb|left|200px]]\n\nConcerned that R.C.X. commander [[Nigel Orpington-Smythe (Earth-616)|Peter (Nigel Orpington-Smythe)]] planned to turn the children into a parahuman army, some R.C.X. agents, including [[Michael (RCX) (Earth-616)|Michael]], Raphael and [[Matthew (Gabriel) (Earth-616)|Gabriel]], tried to hide the Warpies and forced Brian Braddock (alias [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]]) to take the Warpies into his home ([[Braddock Manor]]), figuring that he could lend them much needed protection, both physical and politically. However, the agents' decision to not fully inform the hero of their situation meant he was reluctant to help.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 9}}. \n\nReleased by error by [[Meggan Puceanu (Earth-616)|Meggan]], the [[Cherubim (Earth-616)|Cherubim]] attacked the Manor, before [[Cherub Whirlwind (Earth-616)|Cherub Whirlwind]]'s deaths. The Warpies were then placed under the care of the Braddock Manor robot [[Mastermind (Computer) (Earth-616)|Mastermind]] who was planning Captain Britain fall and the ascension of a new order with the R.C.X. agents. \n\n[[Joshua N'Dingi (Earth-616)|Joshua N'Dingi]], the heir of [[Mbangawi]]'s kingdom, was sent to England where he became a member of R.C.X. He was hideously scarred when a [[Robert Arnold (Earth-616)|Warpie baby]] exploded at his face. The British government spent millions outfitting him with cybernetic parts.{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 10}}{{r|Astonishing X-Men: Xenogenesis Vol 1 3}} He kept from his experience an hatred for the Warpies.\n\n===No more new [[Warpies (Race)|Warpies]]===\nIt was stated by [[Roma (Otherworld)|Roma]] and Braddock's computer [[Mastermind (Computer) (Earth-616)|Mastermind]] that [[Linda McQuillan (Earth-238)|Linda McQuillan]], as an anomaly from the now erased [[Earth-238]], was preventing [[Earth-616]] from healing of his wounds caused by [[James Jaspers (Earth-616)|James Jaspers]]'s reality-manipulations: The continuous born of Warpies and the existence of the [[Crazy Gang (Earth-616)|Crazy Gang]].\nLeaving Earth-616 to [[Otherworld]], the Warp-children cease to appears, from now to the [[Warpies_(Race)#Xenogenesis|apparition of news one, several years after]].{{r|Captain Britain Vol 2 14}}\n\nThen, under Roma's direction, Mastermind decided to took care by himslef of Braddock Manor's Warpies, inviting Michael that he and the R.C.X. were welcome to assist him, but he was the only in command.\n\nThrough an association with the [[Weird Happenings Organization (Earth-616)|W.H.O.]], some of the R.C.X. Warpies were relocated to [[Muir Island]], at [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira MacTaggert]]'s care.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 254}} The Island was soon attacked but the Warpies were unharmed. Their fate was unknown.\n\n===[[Cloud Nine (Earth-616)|Cloud Nine]]===\nEventually, Peter and his [[Cloud Nine (Earth-616)|Cloud Nine]] recaptured the Warpies and his errant agents, bombing the Braddock Manor and kidnapping the children. Peter used the powers of the Warpies to make the underground complex Cloud Nine. He then formed different Warpie teams for various purposes, including the [[Advocates (Earth-616)|Advocates]] and the [[Seraphim (Warpies) (Earth-616)|Seraphim]], as well as the already existing [[Cherubim (Earth-616)|Cherubim]]. \n\nWhen many Warpies started to lose their super powers as a result of the change in [[Merlyn (Otherworld)|Merlyn]]'s Cosmic Convergence, Peter captured the British super team [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] and told them they were suffering from the same genetic defects as the Warpies did, presenting them as [[Homo Superior|mutants]], in the hope that they would cure the Warpies as well as join his organization.\n\n[[File:Warpies Kids 06 from Excalibur Vol 1 65 0001.jpg |thumb|left|400px]]\n\nHowever Excalibur learned of his true plans and engage battle with the Warpies teams. As the heroes were upon to loose, many weaker warpies joined the fight on their side, and a massive melee started in [[Cloud Nine]], stopped by the defeat of Peter. The freed R.C.X. agents and Excalibur ally [[Alistaire Stuart (Earth-616)|Alistaire Stuart]] took command of R.C.X. and took care of the Warpies.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 65}}\n\n===War on Otherworld===\nThe Warpies were later abducted and mutated by [[Black Air (Earth-616)|Black Air]] and then used as weapons by the robot [[Mastermind (Computer) (Earth-616)|Mastermind]] under the guise of [[Roma (Otherworld)|Roma]], who tried to take control of [[Otherworld]], destroying a lot of the [[Captain Britain Corps]] members. The [[Cherubim (Earth-616)|Cherubim]] were used as Mastermind's elite corps.\n\nAfter a team of mutated and armored warpies led by [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-811)|Widget]] on [[Linda McQuillan (Earth-238)|Captain UK]], Excalibur rebands and came to Otherworld.\n\nThe robot was eventually defeated by the newly formed Excalibur, and Captain Britain was appointed Otherworld's new leader and he used his powers and Excalibur sword to cure all Warpies present and possibly all warpies in the Multiverse. The Warpies were now ordinary human children again.\n\nIt was revealed that all those events were been planed by Widget and [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]], in purpose to an unrevealed yet plan..\n\n===[[Revolution]]===\nLeader of [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]], [[Peter Wisdom (Earth-616)|Peter Wisdom]] bombed a Secret Service laboratory who dessicated [[Warpies (Earth-616)|Warpies]], and blaming [[Alistaire Stuart (Earth-616)|Alistaire Stuart]] to haven't closed down this lab when he became the leader of the [[MI13 (Earth-616)|Office of Paranormal Activies]]. He then warmed him about secrets services, such as [[Black Air (Earth-616)|Black Air]],'s violations of the human right, especially about those to [[Homo Superior|mutants]], promising to look close of them.{{r|X-Force Vol 1 102}}\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = During Otherworld battle, [[Linda McQuillan (Earth-238)|Captain U.K.]] stated that the Warpies were from an alternate reality and were brought by the R.C.X. on Earth-616.{{r|Excalibur Vol 2 3}}\nThis statement wasn't denied but strongly oppose to all the informations we had on the Warpies, including the fact that the. Mastermind soon later affirm the same.{{r|Excalibur Vol 2 4}}\nThis seems to be a mistake.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = [http://www.rayeye.nl/ Rayeye's Ocean X] (NL)\n}}\n[[Category:British Organizations]]\n[[Category:Jaspers Warp]]"
