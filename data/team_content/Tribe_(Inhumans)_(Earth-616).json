They came to blows with the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]] after two of its members kidnapped an Inhuman named [[Mark Sim (Earth-616)|Haechi]], and brought him to Jakarta. The Tribe retreated when the New Warriors proved stronger than anticipated and Haechi refused to join them.{{r|New Warriors Vol 5 7|8}}\n\nAfter learning from [[Maximus Boltagon (Earth-616)|Maximus the Mad]] that [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] kidnapped [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses Cain]], the Tribe declared war on Iron Man. Their first act was to [[Stark Manufacturing Facility SZ-4]] near [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]]. When confronted by [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Queen Medusa]] and the [[Ultimates (Earth-616)|Ultimates]], the Tribe claimed their terrorist act was done in the name of Queen Medusa. After a brief fight with the Ultimates and Medusa, Medusa had [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]] teleport the Tribe to the Triskelion where they were taken into custody.{{r|Uncanny Inhumans Vol 1 12|13}}\n\nMembers of the Tribe, including their leader Leader, later escaped from custody and learned that the former Inhuman king [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] had returned to Earth but wasn't as strong as he once was. The Tribe attacked Black Bolt intending to capture him, but Black Bolt was tougher than expected. So, Lash decided to take Black Bolt's new friend [[Blinky (Earth-616)|Blinky]] captive to force Black Bolt to come to him.{{r|Black Bolt Vol 1 9}}\n\nBlack Bolt eventually came to rescue Blinky while accompanied by the villain [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]]. The pair fought off the Tribe, but Black Bolt was forced to surrender while Titania was knocked out when Lash threatened Blinky's life. The Tribe then revealed their plan to use Black Bolt's blood to power a crude T-Bomb to create new Inhumans all over the world. Things went awry when the ancient Inhuman the [[Jailer (Inhuman) (Earth-616)|Jailer]] revealed himself from within Blinky and went on the attack. After the Jailer killed [[Jack Chain (Earth-616)|Jack Chain]] and Lash, the rest of the Tribe retreated and likely disbanded.{{r|Black Bolt Vol 1 10|11}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Teleportation via Lash\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
