Like it's rival the [[Annihilation Wave (Earth-616)|Annihilation Wave]], it consists of both ground forces and a space fleet. The main difference being that unlike the mostly \"bug\" forces of the Annihilation Wave, the Negative Zone Hordes consists of humanoids from various species and is led by [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus's]] rival warlord and sometime ally, [[Blastaar (Earth-616)|Blastaar]].\n| History                 = In the aftermath of the [[Annihilation (Event)|Annihilation War]] and the \"death\" of Annihilus, the [[Kree]] made Blastaar the ruler of the Negative Zone. They granted him full authority and made him their client king){{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 8}} Within a few years, an alliance between the [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]] and Blastaar was established thru the [[Fraternity of Raptors (Earth-616)|Fraternity of Raptors]] who gave Blastaar the [[Cosmic Control Rod]]. In which he agreed to strike the ceded Kree territories.{{r|War of Kings: Ascension Vol 1 3}}\n\nBack in the Negative Zone his forces assaulted [[Prison 42]], the Terran interdimensional jail  to recruit its superhuman inmates and then invade Earth. He laid siege to the prison which was defended by the inmates as the guards had fled back to Earth. [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] was successful in closing the gateway, though Blastaar was able to recruit most of the surviving inmates.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 8|10}}\n\nShi'ar assault forces attacked the Kree territories that were ceded to the Annihilation Wave, reinforced by hundreds of thousands of allied troops from the Negative Zone.{{r|Nova Vol 4 27}}\nUpon the conquest of the Shi'ar by the Kree, Blaastar became an independent power.{{r|Nova Vol 4 28}} Meanwhile back in the Negative Zone, the US government sent superhumans from the Initiative to take back prison 42, which they did after fierce fighting and taking heavy casualties.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Vol 1 27}}\n\nLater his forces were among those participating in the battle against the [[Earth-10011|Cancerverse]] invasion of the the positive universe.{{r|Thanos Imperative Vol 1 3}} In the intensive fighting that followed, Blastaar's forces soon suffered approximately 50% casualties, just like the Shi'ar, Kree, and other allied forces.{{r|Thanos Imperative Vol 1 5}} Blastaar's forces then fled from the battle at the Fault, abandoning their allies.{{r|Thanos Imperative Vol 1 6}}\n\nBlastaar attempted to take advantage of the Kree empire's weakened state a week after the war ended. Invading and nearly conquering it, he defeated their sovereign Medusa but the empire was saved by the Annihilators who forced him and his forces to retreat back to the Negative Zone, greatly diminished.{{r|Thanos Imperative: Devastation Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Interstellar warp-capable warships, directed energy weapons (e.g. beam weapons), armored combat vehicles, combat aircraft\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Interplanetary Organizations]]\n[[Category:Alien Military Forces]]\n[[Category:Interstellar Fleets]]\n[[Category:Interdimensional Organizations]]"
