(Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facility. After \"resurrecting\" Bastion, they then harvested the remains of [[Magus (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Magus]], modified it into a [[Techno-Organic Virus |techno-organic virus]] (or T.O. virus) and injected his remains into several living and dead known mutant killers ([[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]], [[Leper Queen (Earth-616)|the Leper Queen]], [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Reverend William Stryker]], [[Stephen Lang (Earth-616)|Stephen Lang]], [[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]], [[Graydon Creed (Earth-616)|Graydon Creed]], and [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar Trask]]), turning them all into [[Technarch]]/human hybrids and \"resurrecting\" the dead members, much to Risman's objections. These mutant killers now constitute an inner circle of leadership for the Purifiers: '''The Human Council'''.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 3}}\n\n\n===Missions===\n\nIndividual members of The Human Council were charged with different duties to give the appearance of several different organizations being run independently while all secretly being directed by Bastion.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}} These missions occasionally overlap and are assigned as follows:\n\n*'''[[Matthew Risman (Earth-616)|Matthew Risman]]''' - Bishop of the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] - With Reverend Craig, he brainwashed Craig's daughter, [[Rahne Sinclair (Earth-616)|Wolfsbane]], and trained her to attack [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] and obtain his wings, which, even though they appeared to be fully organic, were still composed of [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]]'s [[Techno-Organic Virus|techno-organic strain]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 4}} Using the sample, the Purifiers employed [[Facility (Earth-616)|The Facility]]'s [[Adam Harkins (Earth-616)|Adam Harkins]] to duplicate the strain and use it to create an elite team of Purifiers called \"[[Choir (Earth-616)|the Choir]]\". After learning that Bastion was planning to remove Risman from the group's leadership, Risman led the Choir against Bastion's Purifiers in an attempt to destroy Bastion and the reanimated remains of Stryker, considering them unholy. However, Archangel attacked the Purifiers in an attempt to reclaim the wings that were stolen from him, killing every member of the Choir. Soon after that, Matthew Risman was shot in the head by [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] before Risman was able to kill Bastion.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 6}}\n\n*'''[[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Reverend William Stryker]]''' - Archbishop of the [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]] - After Risman's death, Stryker resumed leadership of the Purifiers and continued to prepare his religious acolytes for the return of the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Mutant Messiah]] and impending war.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men #523}} Stryker and a team of Purifier soldiers attempted to ambush [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] and Hope in the hotel they were staying, but he was killed in battle with the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men's]] Alpha Team.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 12}}\n\n*'''[[Cameron Hodge (Earth-616)|Cameron Hodge]]''' - Founder of The [[Right (Earth-616)|Right]] - Hodge has begun recruiting for The Right group and rebuilding his Smiley-Faces army to prepare for the return of the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Mutant Messiah]] and impending war.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 12}} Hodge's Smiley-Faces were poised outside of the ruins of the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters|Xavier Institute]] as patrol.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming #1}} When Cable and Hope's location was discovered, Hodge was preparing his Smiley-Face armored troops to assist the Purifiers. However, the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] ambushed him before he could deploy his troops. Hodge reverted into his more robotic form and ripped off [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma's]] left leg before being absorbed by a reluctant [[Warlock (Technarch) (Earth-616)|Warlock]] at the behest of [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy #235}}\n\n*'''[[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]]''' - Leader of the [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]] - Posing as [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], Pierce began training a team of [[Young X-Men (Earth-616)|Young X-Men]] for the purpose of killing the [[New Mutants (Earth-616)|New Mutants]] (or perish in the attempt). Pierce claimed the New Mutants were reorganizing the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Earth-616)|Brotherhood of Mutants]] under the direction of the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]].{{r|Young X-Men #1}} Pierce was exposed as an impostor and imprisoned by in [[Cell Block X]] in [[Graymalkin Industries]] and later move to the [[X-Brig]] on [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]].{{r|Young X-Men #5|#6}}{{r|X-Force Vol 3 12}} There he acted as a sleeper agent for Bastion inside the X-Men's home base. Pierce was responsible for disabling [[Cerebra (Mutant Detector)|Cerebra]] to cripple the X-Men's communications.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #235}} Finally, to ground the X-Men on Utopia, Pierce sacrificed himself to destroyed the [[X-Men Blackbird|Blackbirds]] with a suicide bomb.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 13}}\n\n*'''[[Graydon Creed (Earth-616)|Graydon Creed]]''' - Founder of the [[Friends of Humanity (Earth-616)|Friends of Humanity]] - Claiming witness protection to explain away his \"death\" and using his political clout, Creed again became a public face of anti-mutant policy and began organizing rallies across the [[United States]] for the Friends of Humanity.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}}{{r|X-Force Vol 3 12}} Creed served along with Lang as one of Bastion's close lieutenants when the other members of the Human Council had been killed. Creed and Lang were both converted into robot forms by Bastion to battle the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]; all three were killed in battle by [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 28}}\n\n*'''[[Leper Queen (Earth-616)|The Leper Queen]]''' - Leader of the [[Sapien League]] - Reorganizing her racist/speciesist Sapien League,{{r|X-Force Vol 3 7}} the Leper Queen was charged with capturing several mutants and inject them with a modified strain of the [[Legacy Virus]] to cause their powers to go berserk and kill themselves and thousands surrounding of humans. The Leper Queen was an unwilling participant compelled by Bastion.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 12}} [[Beautiful Dreamer (Morlock) (Earth-616)|Beautiful Dreamer]] was the first. She was released into a [[Friends of Humanity (Earth-616)|Friends of Humanity]] rally in Ames, [[Iowa (State)|Iowa]] killing eleven hundred humans. Next was [[Fever Pitch (Earth-616)|Fever Pitch]] in Jackson Hole, [[Wyoming (State)|Wyoming]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 12}} The next target was the [[United Nations]], and [[Tabitha Smith (Earth-616)|Boom-Boom]], [[Julian Keller (Earth-616)|Hellion]] and [[Noriko Ashida (Earth-616)|Surge]] were all abducted for this purpose. While Hellion and Surge were sent to the U.N., Boom-Boom was kept as a decoy with the Leper Queen to lure the X-Force into killing her.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 13}} The X-Force was successful in stopping the final attacks, narrowly saving Boom-Boom, Hellion and Surge and killing the Leper Queen.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 17}}{{r|X-Force Vol 3 18}} These mutant-caused mass murders were meant to compel the world to respond to the perceived mutant threat, and they were successful. Because of these incidents, the U.N. formed the '''[[Mutant Response Division (Earth-616)|Mutant Response Division]]'''.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 18}}\n\n*'''[[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar Trask]]''' - Inventor of the [[Sentinels]] - Trask used his connections in [[Washington, D.C.]] and the U.N. to be placed in a high ranking position in the newly formed Mutant Response Division to deal with the few mutants outside of [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] (specifically [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor Investigations crew]] and possibly others). Like the Leper Queen, Trask appears to be resistant to Bastion's control.{{r|X-Factor #204}} Leading the MRD troops to attack X-Factor at their safe house, Trask was briefly freed from Bastion's control when [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Monet]] attempted to read his mind. Trask used this moment of freedom to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head.{{r|X-Factor #206}}\n\n*'''[[Stephen Lang (Earth-616)|Stephen Lang]]''' - Head of Project: Armageddon - Like Trask, Lang was placed in a high ranking position in the Mutant Response Division. As Trask is dealing with the mutant population in [[New York City]], Lang is hunting mutants in more remote locations. Recently he was stationed in [[Portugal]] to eliminate [[Vanisher (Earth-616)|Vanisher]] at his safe house/brothel in Monsato.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 13}} Lang served along with Creed as one of Bastion's close lieutenants when the other members of the Human Council had been killed. Lang and Creed were both converted into robot forms by Bastion to battle the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]; all three were killed in battle by [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 28}}\n\n===[[Necrosha]]===\nNot long after the Human Council's formation, [[Eliphas (Earth-616)|Eli Bard]] left to bring the T.O. Virus to [[Selene Gallio (Earth-616)|Selene the Black Queen]] which lead to the events of [[Necrosha]]. He became a member of [[Inner Circle (Selene) (Earth-616)|Selene's Inner Circle]] until his death.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 24}} The mysteriously mutant resurrections across the world led Bastion to realizes that someone had gotten hold of the T.O. virus. This spurs him onto accelerating his mysterious plan.{{r|X-Necrosha #1}}\n\n===[[Second Coming]]===\nWith the return of [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] and [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope, the Mutant Messiah]], Bastion final plans for the extinction of [[Homo superior|mutantkind]] have begun.{{r|X-Men: Second Coming #1}} Bastion began tracking the pair to using Cable's T.O. virus as a beacon. Hodge's Smiley-Faces and Stryker's Purifiers have both been used to attempt to kill Hope.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #523}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 12}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy #235}} Once the X-Men understood how Bastion was tracking Cable they broke into two team: [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], [[Rogue (Anna Marie) (Earth-616)|Rogue]] and Hope teleporting back to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]] and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], Cable and the remainder of Alpha Team to act as decoys.{{r|X-Men: Legacy #235}} Bastion quickly uncovered the deception and attempted to kill Hope personally, but he is confronted by Rogue and then damaged when Nightcrawler sacrifices himself to save Hope.\n\nAfter Hope arrived on Utopia, Bastion launched the next phase of his plan. During the months leading up to Hope's return a large energy dome was built over the [[San Francisco|Bay Area]] to cut off the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] from escape or help. Once the dome was activated, Bastion opened a dimensional portal from his [[Earth-811|home reality]] to allow in more [[Nimrod (Earth-811)#Nimrod-Series Sentinel|Nimrod-Series Sentinels]].{{r|X-Men: Legacy #236}} Like the original Nimrod, these Sentinels are able to detect, analyze and adapted to mutant powers. They are also self-repairing. The X-Men were barely able to subdue them, and several X-Men sustained severe injuries.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 27}} Every five minutes a wave of five new Nimrod Sentinels continued to appear through the portal.{{r|New Mutants Vol 3 14}} Only by sending [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]], [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] and [[Douglas Ramsey (Earth-616)|Cypher]] into [[Earth-811|the future]] to reprogram and destroy the Nimrod Master Molds were the X-Men successful to defeating them.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 27}}{{r|X-Men: Legacy #237}}{{r|X-Force Vol 3 28}}\n\nOnce the dimensional portal was closed, Bastion decided it was time to confront Hope personally. He converted both Lang and Creed into robot forms to battle the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. However, Hope's mutant powers manifested which allowed her to destroy all three in battle.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 28}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each teammates' arsenal\n\n| Notes                   = * A [[Human High Council (Earth-295)|Human High Council]] exists in the [[Earth-295|Age of Apocalypse]].
