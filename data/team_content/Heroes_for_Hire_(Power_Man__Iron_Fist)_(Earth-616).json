Heroes For Hire was owned by [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] and [[Daniel Thomas Rand-K'ai (Earth-616)|Daniel Rand]]. It had offices on [[Park Avenue]] and two paid employees, secretary [[Jennifer Royce (Earth-616)|Jennie Royce]] and lawyer/business representative, [[Jeryn Hogarth (Earth-616)|Jeryn Hogarth]]. Heroes For Hire would not accept jobs involving extralegal activities.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist Vol 1 54}} \n\n==Origin==\nThey first met at a party held by Jeryn celebrating Luke Cage's exoneration of all charges they were attacked by [[Thomas Stuart (Earth-616)|Stiletto]] and [[Timothy Stuart (Earth-616)|Discus]] teaming up to take them down.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist Vol 1 50}} Cage's efforts led to a fight with Iron Fist, however, upon learning of Cage's situation, Danny later helped him defeat [[Tilda Johnson (Earth-616)|Nightshade]].{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist Vol 1 #51|52}} Cleared of criminal charges, they briefly worked for [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]]'s detective agency [[Daughters of the Dragon (Earth-616)|Nightwing Restorations]] but soon elected to become a two-man team, \"Heroes for Hire\". Although the streetwise Cage and the unworldly Iron Fist seemed to have little in common, they soon became the best of friends.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist Vol 1 53}}\n\n==Heroes for Hire==\n[[File:Power Man and Iron Fist Vol 3 1 Classic Variant Textless.jpg|right|thumb|300px]]\nDanny visited [[Joy Meachum (Earth-616)|Joy Meachum]] and relinquished control of his share of [[Rand Corporation (Earth-616)|Rand-Meachum Inc.]] to her until such a time that he believed he's earned the wealth from the company. Their first official mission as a team was against the [[Incinerator (Earth-616)|Incinerator]] who tried to rob Manhattan National Bank. They took him down easily using the sprinkler system, then Cage just knocked him out.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #54}} They next attended a local car show to advertise the business, which Cage found boring until it was attacked by the [[Bull (Criminal) (Earth-616)|Bull]] and his thugs. Their mission was to steal the [[Fantasti-Car MK II|Fantasti-Car]] which was on display at the show. The duo took out the thugs with little effort.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #55}}\n\n==Living Monolith==\nThe were hired by [[Ahmet Abdol (Earth-616)|Ahmet Abdol]] and Professor Merridew to protect an exhibit of ancient Egyptian artifacts on display at the Metropolitan Museum. [[Jaime Garcia (Earth-616)|Senor Suerte]] tried to rob the museum and they initially stopped him but the artifacts they recovered were revealed to be fakes. Teaming up with [[Rafael Scarfe (Earth-616)|Lt. Rafael Scarfe]] of the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|N.Y.P.D.]] they followed a lead and ended up at the apartment of Ahmet Abdol who was revealed to be the \"Living Monolith\".{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #56}} The Monolith then began a rampage on the city and the pair teamed up with Misty, [[Colleen Wing (Earth-616)|Colleen Wing]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] to stop him. They learned that he was empowered by the Cheops Crystal, which was stealing life energy from people. They freed the imprisoned people and the Monolith returned to normal.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #57}}\n\n==El Aguila==\nThe duo tried to take down [[Alejandro Montoya (Earth-616)|El Aguila]], a \"hero for the underprivileged\", who was taking on drug dealers and crime lords with a sword. J.P. Preston, the owner of the London Street Property Owners Association (who owned local slum housing), hired the team to stop El Aguila, who had been robbing his offices. They reluctantly accepted and when they confronted El Aguila, Preston tried to shoot him but Cage got in the way and he escaped. Preston screamed at them to stop him but they reminded him that they got paid a retainer regardless of success or failure and that since it was after 5:00 their shift was over and they left.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #58}}\n\n==Manhattan Bomber==\nThe incident with J.P. Preston gave them bad press appearing in an article in the [[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Daily Bugle]]. Danny was injured in an explosion and [[Alan Cavenaugh (Earth-616)|Alan Cavenaugh]] was the main suspect.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #59}} He was taken to the police under suspicion that he was the \"Manhattan Bomber\" because of Cavenaugh's past ties with the IRA. They were hired by the ambassador to [[Halwan]], who offered them $1000 to determine who the bomber was. During the investigation they proved his innocence and Alan helped them find the bomb before it blew up the embassy.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #60}}\n\n==Maggia==\n[[Benjamin Donovan (Earth-616)|Big Ben Donovan]] came to them for help after being attacked by goons of the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]]. However they were led by [[Michael Marko (Earth-616)|Man Mountain Marko]] who knocked Cage into some exposed electrical wire. [[William Carver (Earth-616)|Thunderbolt]] was also following Donavan as a suspect in  a murder case and believed Iron Fist was just another thug but after a brief battle they realized their mistake. Cage and Donovan were taken to  [[Caesar Cicero (Earth-616)|Caesar Cicero]], who wanted to know the location of the stolen drugs. {{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #61}} They tracked down Cicero's penthouse, but Cage was taken to a graveyard to be buried alive. They found the grave and rescued their friend, but Donovan revealed that he kept the drugs for himself and ordered the hit on Thunderbolt's brother. Having found his brother's killer, Thunderbolt died happy, leaving them to turn in Donovan.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #62}}\n\n==Senor Suerte/Senor Muerte==\nThey smashed up a number of [[Jaime Garcia (Earth-616)|Senor Suerte]]'s gambling operations, who now wanted revenge for the death of his brother. This gained them a lot of popularity regarding their latest case. Suerte placed a bomb in the [[Gem Theater]], destroying the building and injuring [[David Griffith (Earth-616)|D.W. Griffith]].{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #63}} The heroes tracked down Senor Suerte and [[Phillip Garcia (Earth-616)|Senor Muerte]] and as they were arrested they swore to get revenge.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #64}}\n\n==Visit to Canada==\nThe team was called to Canada where they visited Jeryn's private office. He brought them there as women on his staff may have been stealing the various assets that are kept at the Aerie. When El Aguila arrived to attack the Aerie, he ultimately ends up teaming up with the Heroes for Hire, and exposing a number of Jeryn's support staff who are responsible.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #65}}\n \n==Sabretooth & Constrictor==\nWhen Misty and Colleen were injured in a fight against [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] and the [[Frank Payne (Earth-616)|Constrictor]], they asked the Heroes for Hire for help. They took down the criminals and rescued Misty whose bionic arm was trapped in a vault.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #66}}\n\n==Bushmaster==\nLuke was kidnapped when they were breaking up a bank robbery. They later found out he was captured by his old foe [[John McIver (Earth-616)|Bushmaster]]. He wanted [[Noah Burstein (Earth-616)|Dr. Noah Burstein]] to reverse the process that slowly rends him immobile. He did this by holding his wife hostage. Danny tracked him to his lab on a ship. Danny freed Luke, and before Bushmaster could push the button to signal to his men to kill Noah's wife, he became totally inert. As Bushmaster's body crumbled into a skeleton the others escaped.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #67}} After the incident Luke had lost his super-powers. But they still needed to rescue Emma Burstein, but in his weakened state Luke was left back at the office to recover. [[Arthur Nagan (Earth-616)|Dr. Arthur Nagan]] came after Luke for revenge after his defeat by him and the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]]. Luke escaped to find his friends, but Nagan followed. During a fight Luke is knocked into the electric fence. However, instead of killing him the electricity restores his super-powers, allowing to take down Nagan with ease.{{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #68}}\n<!--\n===Colonel Eschat===\nNathaniel Turner, a former soldier of fortune, came to the Heroes for Hire for protection. They were all targeted by Colonel Eschat, who was seeking to kill them so that he cannot be identified.

But during the investigation they learn he is a dictator and running the drug operations himself. With the help of the locals they overthrew the despot leader. {{r|Power Man and Iron Fist #70}}\n<!--\n===Montenegro===\n[[Montenegro (Earth-616)|Montenegro]] and Luke originally crossed paths when Cage took a quarter that belonged to Montenegro.
