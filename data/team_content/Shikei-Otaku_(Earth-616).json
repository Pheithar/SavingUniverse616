It was into cheap drugs, easy sex, and most of all, casual violence. While on the road, the gang ran into the [[Masters of Silence (Earth-616)|Masters of Silence]] who had been hired by their parents. They were hired to avenge the unendurable shame that the gang's thievery and violence had brought to their houses. Every member of the gang was killed by the Masters of Silence.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 147}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Gangs]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Japanese Organizations]]"
