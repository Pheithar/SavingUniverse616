He admired the [[U-Men (Earth-616)|U-Men]], but was unwilling to participate in their religious rituals and the modus operandi of their transformation (harvesting and implanting mutant organs). With John Sublime gone, Lobe founded a society, the [[Sublime Corporation (Earth-616)|Sublime Corporation]], intending to make a reality of Sublime's ideal, and profit from it. Lobe recruited four associates: [[Verre (Earth-616)|Verre]], [[Thug (Mutate) (Earth-616)|Thug]], [[Burst (Earth-616)|Burst]], and [[Bouncing Betty (Earth-616)|Bouncing Betty]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 515}}\n\n===Nation X===\nHe somehow obtained six [[Predator X|Predators X]] (but one got loose), enhanced them cybernetically, and infused them with nanomachine spies. He then led his team to capture [[John Greycrow (Earth-616)|Scalphunter]] and forced him to fly a jet containing the Predators X to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 516}} After the X-Men defeated the Predators, the nanomachines were released from the bodies and spied on all the mutants, analyzing their fighting styles, powers, and DNA.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 519}} The nanobots then transmitted to Lobe, who able to use it to enhance his team's capabilities, and give himself [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine's]] healing factor, with the ultimate goal being to replicate their powers for everybody on Earth and make profit of it.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 517}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 520}}\n\nWhen [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] got news of a Predator X attack in [[New York City]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], and [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] were sent to investigate. When they tracked down Lobe's team to a skyscraper, the X-Men were almost defeated until the fortuitous arrival of [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 520}}\n\nOnce Fantomex destroyed Lobe's central computer, his team lost their fighting edge, and were defeated. Lobe then released [[HX-N1]], the influenza-based mutant plague, revealing that he was working for John Sublime. He and his team escaped, and his base exploded. The explosion was green like the plague gas, and was released high above the streets of Manhattan from a skyscraper, but that didn't seem to worry the X-Men at the time.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 521}}\n\nLobe later used his team as bodyguards and security guards during the promotion in [[San Francisco]] of his [[Xperience]], the drug based on the mutant genome, who could give defined powers to every human. They were defeated by a team of X-Men uninfected by the mutant plague, and their fate wasn't revealed.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 530|534}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = *The title \"New U-Men\" is never used in canon, but, like the original [[U-Men (Earth-616)|U-Men]], this group does have ties to [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Sublime]] and they are humans who've augmented their own bodies with [[Homo Superior|mutant]]-like powers; however, this group does not appear to share the U-Men's fanatical ideals about creating the perfect race of beings: ''Homo Perfectus''.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
