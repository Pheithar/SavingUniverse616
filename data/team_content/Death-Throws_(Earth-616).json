When he met brothers and jugglers [[Oddball|Elton]] and [[Tenpin|Alvin Healey]], he recruited both of them for a new gang of costumed criminals: The [[Death-Throws]], under the leadership of Last, would be at the same time costumed mercenaries and jugglers. They would take advantage of their juggling skills and use throwing weapons. Elton adopted the name of [[Elton Healey (Earth-616)|Oddball]] due to his looney nature, and his tenpin-throwing brother would be known as the [[Alvin Healey (Earth-616)|Tenpin]]. The fourth member of the team was [[Nicholas Grossman (Earth-616)|Knicknack]], recruited under undisclosed circumstances.{{r|Captain America #317}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #3}}\n\n[[File:Death-Throws (Earth-616) from Captain America Vol 1 317 0001.jpg|thumb|left]]\nAlthough the Death-Throws valued teamwork more than other villain groups, Oddball suddenly broke up with the Death-Throws for unknown reasons. Tenpin found him after a while, and took him back to the Death-Throws. While solo, Oddball had began to work with another criminal juggler, [[Wendy Conrad (Earth-616)|Bombshell]], and had convinced her to join the Death-Throws.{{r|Hawkeye #3}}\n\nOddball's previous boss [[Crossfire]] contacted the Death-Throws from jail. He wanted the jugglers to release him, and agreed to pay them when he was freed. The Ringleader accepted the deal, and the other Death-Throws worked together to free Crossfire. However, once they had taken Crossfire to their own HQ, they discovered that Crossfire was broke! His assets had been impounded and he had lost any useful link with [[Cross Technologies]]. The Death-Throws decided to use Crossfire as a bait to attract Hawkeye and [[Captain America (Steve Rogers)|Captain America]] to a trap, but those two Avengers defeated all of the Death-Throws. Tenpin and his partners went to jail.{{r|Captain America #317}}\n\nAlthough Oddball was killed in [[Madripoor]], and Bombshell temporarily left the team, the Death-Throws continued with their usual crime contracts. They even went to [[London (England)|London]] with their old boss, Crossfire, as part of a [[Radically Advanced Ideas in Destruction (Earth-616)|R.A.I.D.]] terrorist attack on the city. They were tasked with causing destruction and death on Tower Bridge, but were defeated by [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]] and [[Ruth Bat-Seraph (Earth-616)|Sabra]].{{r|Union Jack Vol 2 2}}\n\nSoon after the [[Avengers & X-Men: AXIS|World War Hate]], the Death-Throws attempted to rob the Big Top Casino in Las Vegas, but their plan was thwarted by [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]].{{r|Loki: Agent of Asgard Vol 1 8}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Ad hoc\n| Weapons                 = Each of the members uses own weapons, although they commonly juggle weapons to another teammate\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
