However, Strange learned of their temple while he was looking for the last traces of magic on the Earth. He incapacitated Wong to prevent him and the Disciples from risking their lives, and ordered those who had traveled there to leave.\n\nRegardless of this, when Doctor Strange confronted the leader of the Empirikul, the [[Imperator (Earth-616)|Imperator]], the remaining Disciples and hundreds of people across the world supported Strange and absorbed his pain so he could fight until the Imperator's defeat.\n\nOnce the dust settled, Wong sent the monks home and dismantled the Secret Disciples at Strange's request.{{r|Doctor Strange Vol 4 9}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]"
