Some of them seem to have received mechanical enhancements in addition. The origin of the X-Genes as for those of the human bases are unknown.\n\nThey had taken down a first [[Annex Squads (Earth-89149)|Annex Squad]], and kept in the fight with the second one was sent later{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 30}}. All over the planet, the New Mutants followed, tracked and confronted that second [[Annex Squads (Earth-89149)|Annex Squad]], fighting in a [[Secret War]].\n\nAt some point, they followed the scouts in [[Tian (China)|Tian]], an hidden city in [[China]], where the invaders looked for a power-source to charge their [[Ghost boxes|Ghost Box]]. As the city was powered by the [[Chinese X-Men (Earth-616)|Chinese mutant community]] living there, dead since the [[M-Day]], they couldn't find it, and so [[Agent X-13 (Earth-89149)|Agent X-13]] split from the group with the Box. He was followed by one of the artificial mutants, [[Triploid Mutant (Artificial Mutant) (Earth-616)|one with flight powers]], whose was killed by X-13 in [[San Francisco]] and whose corpse was found by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], who started to inquiry on the subject{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 25}}, using the \"Triploid Mutant\"'s (as was named the dead mutant) notebook relating his track of the invaders.\n\nLater, the X-Men showed up in Tian, captured the \"Chameleon\",{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 28}} killed the remaining invading agents, and follow the trail to the [[Wundagore Mountain]] base of Forge,{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 29}}\n\nThe Chameleon was taken to Wundagore{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 29}} and freed from the [[X-Men Blackbird]] by Forge's systems while his Maker was discussing with the heroes.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 30}}\n\nForge, thinking the X-Men were joining his fight, show to them the remains of his New Mutants, and after discussions, tried to force them to go though the [[Ghost boxes|Ghost Box]] Forge had found in destroying the first team.\n\nAfter a quick fight, and the emergence of a [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] from the other side of the Box, the X-Men left and the base was destroyed with a giant-laser fired by [[Abigail Brand (Earth-616)|Abigail Brand]] of [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] from Orbit.{{r|Astonishing X-Men Vol 3 30}}\n\nForge and his New Mutants, including the Chameleon, were seemingly killed. However Forge later somehow resurfaced.{{r|Marvel NOW!
