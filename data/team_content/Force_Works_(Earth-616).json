[[Iron Man (Anthony \"Tony\" Stark)|Iron Man]] revealed his new plan for a proactive team based in a highly sophisticated, adaptable building known as [[Works|The Works]]. A special 'hex mainframe' computer worked with the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]]'s power to predict events that the team could act on. Through her powers and the computer's calculations, they could proactively determine where the team was most needed rather than react to an alarm or breaking news. The original roster consisted of most of the final lineup of the Avengers West Coast, namely: Scarlet Witch, Iron Man, [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]], [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]], and [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|U.S. Agent.]]{{r|Force Works #1}}\n\nThe team started off on a bad note, losing Wonder Man on its first mission, a space battle against the [[Kree]]. This deeply traumatized the Scarlet Witch, with whom Wonder Man had been involved. It would be some time before she recovered. The alien warrior [[Century (Alien) (Earth-616)|Century]] soon joined them.{{r|Force Works #1|3}}\n\nWhile investigating instances of monsters and people apparently trapped in their sleep, the team was assisted by [[Willie Walkaway (Earth-616)|Dreamguard]].{{r|Force Works #9|10}}\n\n[[File:Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 3 Portacio Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe team responded to a centuries-old battle between rival ethnic groups lead by their champions [[Volkvhy (Earth-616)|Volkvhy]] and [[Pavel Chenklo (Earth-616)|Ember]] in [[Slorenia]]. The cyborg mercenary [[Black Brigade (Earth-616)|Black Brigade]] was also involved, battling Iron Man. The team was successful, ending generations of one side enslaving the other.{{r|Force Works #11|12}}\n\nThe [[Recorder RE-404 (Earth-616)|Rigellian Recorder]] was revealed to be corrupted, and was soon defeated by Century. Tension in the ranks began as Scarlet Witch, the nominal leader, was countermanded more and more by Iron Man.{{r|Force Works #13|14}}\n\nIron Man began acting strangely due to the influence of [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]]. The ruthless [[Suzi Endo (Earth-9528)|Cybermancer]] became a member, and the team was ordered to capture [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]], their former leader as West Coast Avengers chairman, who had been framed for the murders at [[Avengers Mansion]]. Public Relations director [[Amanda Chaney (Earth-616)|Amanda Chaney]] was murdered in the process.\n\nThe mysterious [[Moonraker (Earth-616)|Moonraker]] was confronted about his sudden appearance on the team. He claimed he was actually [[Gustav Brandt (Earth-616)|Libra]] shortly before being abducted.\n\nIron Man and [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]] battled and destroyed most of The Works. It was revealed that there were chronograph weapons in a hidden sub-basement programmed to bombard the planet. Scarlet Witch, U.S. Agent and War Machine managed to disable them despite the building going into ''Defense Code Mordred'', and sending hard light holograms to attack them.<ref>The Crossing crossover.</ref> Soon after this the team were confronted by an alternate reality version of [[Simon Williams (Earth-9528)|Wonder Man]]. Facing trauma from this encounter as well as the continuing leadership struggle, the team quietly disbanded.{{r|Force Works #21|22}}\n\nMany years later, Force Works was reinstated during the [[Iron Man 2020 (Event)|robot revolution]] as a taskforce designed to subdue rebel artificial intelligences. The team was operated by [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]], with War Machine serving as field leader.  His teammates included [[Joseph Green (Earth-616)|Gauntlet]], [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]], [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Quake]], [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|U.S. Agent]] and [[James Bourne (Earth-616)|Solo]], but the former left the team after a mission resulted in Gauntlet's hospitalization.\n\nWhen the team was deployed in [[Lingares]] to investigate a mysterious nuclear explosion,{{r|2020 Force Works Vol 1 1}} Force Works crossed paths with an army of [[Deathloks (Earth-616)|Deathloks]] as well as the giant robot [[Ultimo (Earth-616)|Ultimo]].{{r|2020 Force Works Vol 1 2}} They were assisted by [[M.O.D.O.K. Superior (Earth-616)|M.O.D.O.K.]] in killing Ultimo, unbeknownst that he had created the Deathloks in the first place to stop Ultimo. M.O.D.O.K. usurped Ultimo's beheaded body, and rechristened himself UltiM.O.D.O.K., but he was ultimately defeated as well. Despite the success in stopping the Deathloks and Ultimo, Maria Hill fired all the team save for U.S.Agent for both their course of action and their refusal to retrieve M.O.D.O.K.'s files on how to create Deathloks. However, U.S.Agent was only spared because he handed Maria Hill over a blank thumb drive, claiming it contained the files in order to stall Hill until a scrub team sent to Lingares destroyed all traces of the Deathlok operation, including the files.{{r|2020 Force Works Vol 1 3}}\n| Equipment               = Hex-Mainframe Computer, [[Piezo-electrical Logistic Analytical Tactical Operator (Earth-616)|PLATO]]\n| Transportation          = [[Hex-Ship Pegasus]], [[Hex-Ship Chimera]], the [[Works Wagon]].\n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * Following the [[Civil War (Event)|superhuman civil war]], the [[Iowa (State)|Iowa]] division of the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|50-State Initiative]] shared its [[Force Works (Initiative) (Earth-616)|namesake]] with Force Works.{{r|Civil War #6}} [[Suzi Endo (Earth-616)|Cybermancer (Suzanne \"Suzi\" Endo)]] was a member of this team.{{r|Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Vol 1 33}}\n| Trivia                  = * The group was adapted into the supporting cast of the 1994\u20131996 ''Iron Man'' animated series. For the series, Hawkeye appeared in place of U.S. Agent (though he did appear in the 8 issue adaptation of the cartoon). Shortly after the characters were written out of the series, ''Force Works'' was cancelled at issue #22 (April 1996).\n| Links                   = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Works\n}}\n[[ru:\u0421\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438 (616)]]\n[[Category:Force Works]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]"
