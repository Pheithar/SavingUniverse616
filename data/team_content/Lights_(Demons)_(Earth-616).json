After her emerging, she gathered five acolytes, the '''Lights''', banded together with loyalty. All of them were powered beings, but their origins are unknown.\n\n[[File:Phoenix Messiah (Demon) (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 13 0004.png|thumb|left|250px|Communed with  the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]]]]\nTogether, they waged rebellion against the Lord of Stasis, and at last, the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] came to them, and they communed, although the Demon Lords fought to prevent it.\n\n===Evolution restarting===\nThe spell was broken by the Five and One and the Phoenix Force, and the Demons were swept away.\n\nThe whole history was witnessed by the alien peace-keeping robot [[Unit (Earth-616)|Unit]], who intended to witness a billion years later a variant of that story by observing [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], the Mutant Messiah, without her own [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 13}}\n\n==Powers==\nThe Lights seemed to possess the following powers:\n* '''Flight''' thanks to purple cut out wings.\n* Presumably '''Superhuman strength''', scythe-shaped arms and sharp teeth.\n* '''Cryokinesis''' through the hands.\n* A toad-like demon, presumably granted with related abilities.\n\n* The [[Phoenix Messiah (Demon) (Earth-616)|Phoenix Messiah]] was granted with '''Pyrokinesis''' coming through mouth and eyes orbits, unusual body parts for her species.\n\nFollowing their communion with the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]], they were all powered with flight, and possibly other powers related to the Phoenix.\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Their own flight.\n| Weapons                 = Their own powers.\n\n| Notes                   = * Technically, those Lights were the first [[Phoenix Five]] to communed with the [[Phoenix Force]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Flight]]\n[[Category:Thermokinesis]]\n[[Category:Superhuman Strength]]\n[[Category:Cryokinesis]]\n[[Category:Phoenix Force]]\n[[Category:Winged Characters]]\n[[Category:Alien Demons]]\n[[Category:Demonic Organizations]]"
