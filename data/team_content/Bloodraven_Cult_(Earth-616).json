When their bomb was detected by [[Dania (Earth-616)|Dania]] (daughter of the [[Red Raven (Earth-616)|Red Raven]], leader of the [[Bird People]]) sought aid from the visiting [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]]. During the battle, the bomb was set off and the [[Wayfinder (Earth-616)|Wayfinder]] began to cross the dimensions to Earth, clearing the path for the dark gods who would come after it. The cultists fought the heroes to prevent them from stopping Wayfinder's arrival but were defeated when Red Raven maneuvered Sky-Island itself into the portal. The cultists, defeated and captured, faced the judgement of Red Raven.{{R|Defenders Vol 2 6|7}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/bloodravencult.htm Marvel Appendix entry]\n}}\n[[Category:Inhuman Religions]]"
