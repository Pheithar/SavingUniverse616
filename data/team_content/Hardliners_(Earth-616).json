They were to hunt down any super-humans and either take them captive for experimentation of to eliminate them. Their leader was named Reginald Tork. \n[[File:Hardliners (Earth-616) from Alpha Flight Vol 1 120 001.jpg|thumb|left|The Hardliners confront Alpha Flight.]]\nThey first appeared when they attacked [[Albert Louis (Earth-616)|Albert Louis]] in [[Halifax]]{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 118}} and chased him to [[Toronto]] where he confronted [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]]. There, another contignent of Hardliners had caused a battle between the [[Wrecking Crew]] and Alpha when they had tried to capture [[Thunderball]]. When Albert approached Alpha Flight, the Hardliners claimed that they were 'taking him in' in accordance with the Super-Powers Registration Act. When Alpha Flight refused to turn him over, the Hardliners attacked, and were easily defeated by [[Vindicator (Heather Hudson)|Guardian]] and taken into custody.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 120}}\n\nThe entire group was freed when their mysterious backer found legal technicalities in their case and offered to pay for all damages.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 126}}\n\nSomehow, later on, they captured Albert again and Alpha had to rescue him. Rather than facing Alpha Flight directly, the Hardliners made them run their training course, tiring them out. At the end of the course, the heroes met [[Omega Flight (Servants of the Master)|Omega Flight]]. It was then revealed that the Master had been controlling the Hardliners all along. In the ensuing battle the the Master was apparently killed and the Hardliners taken into custody.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 128|30}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Hardliner Armor]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Energy rifles\n\n| Notes                   = * Characters seen wearing [[Hardliner Armor]] were seen in [[Alpha Flight Vol 1 123]] but they were not identified as Hardliners and worked with the police.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
