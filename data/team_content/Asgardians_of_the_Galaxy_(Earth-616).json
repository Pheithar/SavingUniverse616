Their objective was to help him retrieve the [[Naglfar Beacon]] in anticipation of the [[War of the Realms]] waged by [[Malekith (Earth-616)|Malekith the Accursed]]. The team consisted of [[Kevin Masterson (Earth-616)|Thunderstrike]], [[Skurge (Earth-616)|Skurge the Executioner]], [[Simon Walterson (Earth-616)|Throg]], and [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]] and her human host, [[Annabelle Riggs (Earth-616)|Annabelle Riggs]]. The team initially failed their mission, since the space pirate [[Nebula (Earth-616)|Nebula]] obtained it before they could.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe Asgardians followed Nebula's trail, fighting soldiers of the [[Naglfar Armada (Earth-616)|Naglfar Armada]] she summoned on [[Netredeen]] and then on [[Chandilar]] to test its power.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 2}} During battle, Kid Loki was exposed as the mastermind behind the formation of the Asgardians of the Galaxy. The [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]] intercepted the team on [[Chandilar]]{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 3}} and arrested them. Angela let the team remain in captivity until they learned of Nebula's next target, [[Earth]]. Nebula abducted Loki to her ship when he teleported to warn [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]].{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 4}} The Asgardians intercepted Nebula's ship, and Loki used an illusion to incapacitate Nebula long enough for Valkyrie to take the Naglfar Beacon from her hands, prompting her to flee. The Asgardians of the Galaxy were joined by [[Urzuul (Earth-616)|Urzuul]], a [[Dwarves of Nidavellir|dwarf]] Nebula had kidnapped to help her find the beacon.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 5}}\n\nSince Kid Loki had promised Angela to help her find her girlfriend [[Sera (Earth-616)|Sera]] in exchange for joining the Asgardians of the Galaxy, the team visited [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego the Living Planet]], and stumbled into the [[Ravagers (Earth-616)|Ravagers]], resulting in a brief confrontation until Sera made herself present, revealing she had joined this team during her absence.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 6}} After helping the Ravagers protect a group of refugees on the run from [[Chargazel (Earth-616)|Chargazel]]'s [[Raiders (Chargazel) (Earth-616)|Raiders]], the Asgardians of the Galaxy decided to take the Naglfar Beacon to [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]] in anticipation of the War of the Realm's culmination. Kid Loki vanished after the spell that created him was dismissed by the real Loki.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 7}}\n\nOnce in Asgard, the Asgardians of the Galaxy were alerted by [[Heimdall (Earth-616)|Heimdall]] of Malekith's assault in [[Manhattan]].{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 8}} Valkyrie died during battle,{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 2}} and the Asgardians of the Galaxy save for Angela and Urzuul joined forces with [[Clea (Earth-616)|Clea]] and [[Ren Kimura (Earth-616)|Ren Kimura]] to rescue Annabelle from exile in the fringes of Valhalla.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 9}} The Asgardians of the Galaxy continued fighting to free Midgard, and confronted the [[Angels (Tenth Realm)|Angels]] of [[Heven (Tenth Realm)|Heven]] on [[Kenya]]. During this battle, Angela put the Naglfar Beacon to use when she summoned the Naglfar Armada on Heven to draw the Angels away from Earth and into their death, afterwards she destroyed the beacon. The battle was not won without losses, with Skurge fighting until succumbing to injuries and Throg being presumed dead after being flung away from battle and stubmling into a new group of frogs to protect.{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 10}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Various weapons.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Cosmic Teams]]"
