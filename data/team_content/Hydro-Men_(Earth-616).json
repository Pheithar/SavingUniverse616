He was an ecologist who believed that man's only salvation is to adapt and live in the sea. The followers of Dr. Hydro built an artificial island off the Atlantic coast, and used a chemical mist, the [[Terrigen Mists]] possibly acquired from [[Maelstrom (Earth-616)|Maelstrom]] and or [[Phaeder (Earth-616)|Phaeder]], which mutated them into green skinned scaly amphibians.<ref>{{cl|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 6}}; [[Maelstrom (Earth-616)|Maelstrom]] entry</ref>\n\nDr. Hydro also used the chemical to hijack five airliners and expose the passengers as well. [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] came to the rescue of the humans and defeated the cult. Namor was unable to restore the humans to normal, so he requested help from [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] aka Mr. Fantastic. Dr. Richard discovered through studying the green mist, that it has the same properties of the [[Terrigen Mists]] used by the [[Inhumans]] in their Rites of Passage. Dr. Richards with this knowledge was then able to cure all the converted humans using an [[Anti-Terrigenesis Compound]].<ref>{{cl|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 6}}; [[Maelstrom (Earth-616)|Maelstrom]] entry</ref>\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Depowered Terrigenesis-Mutates]]\n[[Category:Terrigenesis]]\n[[Category:Depowered by Technology]]\n[[Category:Depowered by Reed Richards]]\n[[Category:Genetically Engineered]]\n[[Category:Aquatic Races]]"
