The mobs of South Texas were in a brutal gang war over drugs and smuggling which had cost the lives of many and then the Lobo Brothers arrived. They put a stop to the war and united the gangs, with the former gang leaders gone and the Lobo Brothers heading the new syndicate.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 143}} It was the charisma of Carlos Lobo which had convinced the gangs to end the war and unite under the Lobo Brothers.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 152}}\n\nSoon they expanded their operations to [[Dallas]], where they owned a mansion and had drug trafficking operations.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 143}} They were content with their empire in south Texas.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 152}} It all changed when the [[Oswald Silkworth (Earth-616)|Arranger]] who saw them as a threat to the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] had the [[Roland Rayburn (Earth-616)|Persuader]] brainwash the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] into attempting to assassinate the Lobo Brothers. Due to the actions of [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and the Punisher's strong will, it failed.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 143}}\n\nIn retaliation, the Lobo Brothers took the war to the Kingpin in [[New York City]], with the Lobo Brothers leading the assault themselves.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 145}} Within a few weeks they had done much damage to the Kingpin's syndicate as they slaughtered his men and attacked his operations.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 150}} Near the end of their war with the Kingpin, the Lobo Brothers executed a helicopter assault on [[Fisk Towers]] in which they and their men slaughtered everyone from the rooftop to the penthouse suite in an attempt to eliminate the Kingpin who was not there.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 54}} \n\nThe Kingpin wanting an end to the war, arranged a meeting with the Lobo Brothers to make peace. They demanded the life of the Arranger in exchange for peace and just as it seemed that the Kingpin would agree, the meeting was attacked by the Kingpin's rival crimelords ([[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]] and [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]]) as well as Spider-Man himself. During the multi-sided fight, Eduardo Lobo was accidentally shot and killed by his lover [[Gloria Grant (Earth-616)|Gloria Grant]], and Carlos Lobo was knocked out.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 55}}\n\nOver two decades later, the Lobo Cartel was now led by Carlos Lobo and his mutant sister [[Esmeralda Lobo (Earth-616)|Esmeralda Lobo]]. Their new business was human trafficking.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 1}} The lone survivor of a shipment into the United States ([[Mar\u00eda Aracely Penalba (Earth-616)|Hummingbird]]) was hunted by the Lobo siblings who killed the [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]] but failed to capture Hummingbird.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 13}} The Lobo Cartel was working with the human trafficker [[Mr. Moctezuma (Earth-616)|Mr. Moctezuma]] and were aware of Hummingbird's powers, and were undecided as to whether they should kill her as Mr. Moctezuma wanted or recruit her.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 14}}. After a fight with [[Other (Spider-Totem) (Multiverse)|the Other]], Carlos Lobo was injured and while he was recuperating, he was murdered by Mr. Moctezuma.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 15}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Crimelords]]\n[[Category:Mexican Organizations]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]\n[[Category:Cartels]]"
