They consisted of nine warriors who rode winged horses, and were led by [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Brunnhilde]]. In ancient times, the Valkyries used to take the mortally wounded human heroes from German and Scandinavian battlegrounds as well. The Valkyries were no longer able to perform this task when [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]], ruler of Asgard, vowed to the [[Celestials]] a millennium ago that he would severely restrict Asgardian contact with Earth.{{citation}}\n\n==Preface==\nIt should be noted that the concept of warrior-women riding flying horses and conveying the souls of the worthy fallen warriors to the afterlife is frequent in mythology:\n* Circa 500,000 BC, [[Gorm (Deity) (Earth-616)|Father Gorm]]'s [[War Maids (Earth-616)|War Maids]] rode, bearing the spirits of fallen warriors to him.{{r|Creatures on the Loose #24}}<!-- not seen -->\n* Until circa 10,000 BC, during the [[Hyborian Age of Conan]], [[Bori (Earth-616)|Bori]]'s [[Choosers of the Slain (Earth-616)|Choosers of the Slain]] performed the same deed.{{r|Conan the Barbarian #3}}{{r|Conan the Adventurer #7}}\n* Before [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]]'s rule, his father [[Bor Burison (Earth-616)|Bor Burison]] commanded his own Valkyrior, the [[D\u00edsir (Earth-616)|D\u00edsir]].{{citation}}\n\n| HistoryText             = \n[[Image:Valkyries (Earth-616) and Megingjord from Journey Into Mystery Vol 1 91 0001.jpg|left|thumb|The Valkyries' first appearance]]\nIn modern day, Brunnhilde became a member of Earth's superhero team known as the [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]]. The remaining Valkyries were killed in a war between Odin and Hela over rulership of Valhalla. Odin restored the Valkyries to life after he regained possession of Valhalla, but these Valkyries only had physical forms within Valhalla; outside it, they existed only in astral form. [[Valtrauta (Earth-616)|Valtrauta]] took Brunnhilde's place as the leader of the Valkyrior, and [[Hildegarde (Earth-616)|Hildegarde]]'s sister [[Krista (Earth-616)|Krista]] filled the role of the ninth Valkyrie, left open since Brunnhilde's departure.{{citation}}\n\nBy the time [[Malekith (Earth-616)|Malekith the Accursed]] waged his [[War of the Realms]], the Valkyries had grown into an army. When [[Niffleheim]] was invaded by the queen of [[Muspelheim]], [[Sindr (Earth-616)|Sindr]], [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] had [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]] use magic to fake his death in such a way he would still be sent to Valhalla.{{r|Thor Vol 5 3}} Once there, Thor recruited the Valkyries and the [[Einherjar (Earth-616)|Einherjar]] to help fend off Sindr's forces.{{r|Thor Vol 5 4}}\n\nDuring Malekith's assault on Manhattan, the Valkyries were summoned by Odin to help defend the island, having seemingly regained the ability to pass into the real world. Due to an evacuation spell gone awry, [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] accidentally teleported most of the combatants away from the fight, leaving the Valkyries to stand alone against Malekith's forces. They were all ultimately slain in battle, and Brunnhilde was the last Valkyrie to fall.{{r|War of the Realms #2}}\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\n===Powers===\nThe Valkyrior have inherent mystical powers allowing them to perceive supernatural phenomenon, especially to see astral spirits (ghosts) and sense when mortal beings are near death; a perception that appears as a glow around the form of a person about to die. Beyond Asgard, they appear only as shades (astral forms). They are extra-ordinary warriors wielding swords and shields and usually transport themselves aloft on winged horses which attain an astral form with them beyond Asgard.{{citation}}\n\n===Abilities===\nOdin granted the Valkyrior the ability to traverse the nine realms unhindered by physical boundaries that they might ferry the spirits of the noblest warriors into Valhalla.\n\n===Strength level===\nThe Valkyrior possesses the conventional attributes of the Asgardian gods including superhuman strength (Class 40), stamina, resistance to injury and long life enchantments.{{citation}}\n\n| Equipment               = The Valkyries wear Uru armor which protects them from harm.{{citation}}\n| Transportation          = They usually transport themselves aloft on winged horses which attain an astral form with them beyond Asgard.{{citation}}\n| Weapons                 = Each of the Valkyrie carries a sword.{{citation}}\n\n| Notes                   = * Allegedly, the Valkyrior were kinswomen to [[Lilith (Earth-616)|Lilith]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Horror 2005 Vol 1 1|; [[Lilith (Earth-616)|Lilith]]'s entry }}\n* According to [[Torunn Gr\u00f8nbekk]], one of the writers of {{cl|Mighty Valkyries Vol 1}}, the Valkyries don't require [[Idunn (Earth-616)|Iddun]]'s [[Golden Apples of Idunn|Apples]] to sustain their youth, unlike the rest of the Norse Gods.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paanghyaW9I</ref>\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/valkyrior.htm Valkyrior (Earth-616) at the Appendix to the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]\n}}\n[[Category:Valkyries]]"
