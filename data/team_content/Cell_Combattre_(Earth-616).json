The Cell Combattre was infamous for its attack on an [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Earth-616)|RCMP]] station at Christmas time where all the police officers were slain. Eventually, the group retired and returned to semi-normal lives, hoping that no one would determine their true identity. When one of the leaders was murdered, it was revealed that [[Jean-Paul Beaubier (Earth-616)|Northstar]] was the seventh member.\n\nA vigilante, [[Giles McHeath (Earth-616)|Scourge]], was out to kill off the remaining Cell members. Northstar attempted to save the remaining members. [[Alpha Flight (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] felt the need to offer their assistance to Jean-Paul and followed him by using the microchip he was implanted with as a member of Alpha Flight. Unknown to Alpha Flight, they were being followed by the murderer, Scourge, and only realized it when all but two of the members were dead.{{r|Marvel Fanfare Vol 1 28}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/cellcombattreaf.htm Cell Combattre at ''Marvel Appendix'']\n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
