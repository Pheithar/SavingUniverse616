The first time that [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] fought them, he was repeatedly beaten, stabbed, torched, slashed, cut, and had his soul hit. They overloaded his healing factor and almost killed him. Only thing that saved him, was someone called the police. He escaped and crawled into a sewer to heal. In the next confrontation they had with Wolverine, they were defeated as he had received training by a Kung Fu master.{{r|Wolverine: Manifest Destiny Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
