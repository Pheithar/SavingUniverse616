They were contracted to create the [[Omega Clan (Earth-616)|Omega Clan]] to defeat [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]]. They were based out of a floating base disguised as a cloud.{{r|Uncanny X-Force Vol 1 #25}}\n\nThe White Sky Facility, the Cloud, was later used by the disbanding [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] to revive [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]]. [[E.V.A. (Earth-616)|E.V.A.]] hadn't finished to put in the settings when [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] activated the process, leading in the creation of two others Fantomexes, [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Cluster) (Earth-616)|a lady one]] and an other [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Jean-Phillipe) (Earth-616)|dressed in black]], because of the special brains-structure of Fantomex.
