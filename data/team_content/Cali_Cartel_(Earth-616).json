Under the hangers were cocaine\nprocessing plants. The final product was sent to Miami via mini-subs or torpedoes. The operation was attacked by the terrorist of [[Undertow (Earth-616)|Undertow]] and their team of enslaved superhumans, the [[Soldiers of Misfortune (Earth-616)|Soldiers of Misfortune]].{{r|New Warriors Vol 1 65}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Colombian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Cartels]]"
