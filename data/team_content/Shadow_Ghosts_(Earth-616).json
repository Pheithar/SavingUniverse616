They had black magic tattoos and possessed mystical abilities. The Shadow Ghosts assaulted the Mao Shan Pai Monastery in [[London]], resulting in a massacre with every monk dead or needing an ambulance. An ancient and powerful Chinese black magic spell book, the [[Chao-Siwang Shu]], was stolen from the monastery. While in the service to the White Dragon Clan they clashed repeatedly with [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]], the [[Daughters of the Dragon (Earth-616)|Daughters of the Dragon]], and [[Sons of the Tiger (Earth-616)|Sons of the Tiger]].{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 2 2|4}} \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Martial Arts]]\n[[Category:Assassins]]"
