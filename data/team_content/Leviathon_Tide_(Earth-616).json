An [[Summoner (Incentaurian) (Earth-616)|Inhuman warrior]] attempted to use her powers to summon monsters independent of the Tide to fight against them. The resistance proved to be futile, and the Tide emerged triumphant in the end. The planet was devastated and it became the Leviathon Mother's [[Desecrated Nest|desecrated nest]].{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 2 3}}\n\nA few thousand years later, the Leviathon Mother awoke from her slumber and directed the Tide towards [[Earth]]. A handful of monsters started landing on the planet heralding a bigger invasion. The Tide encountered heavy resistance in the form of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]], and many more heroes.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 2 1}} These heroes, however, were struggling to defeat the Tide and prevent civilian casualties as the Leviathons continued to arrive in bigger numbers and shorter periods of time.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 2 2}}\n\nSuddenly, many Goliathons (monsters who had attempted to conquer Earth decades before) appeared,{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 2 2}} having been summoned by the [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] [[Kei Kawade (Earth-616)|Kei Kawade]] and managed to defeat the biggest Leviathon congregation in [[San Diego]], [[California (State)|California]]. Upon hearing of this defeat from [[Leviathon Servitors|her servitors]], the Leviathon Mother gave the order to send all of the remaining Leviathons to Earth to crush the resistance.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 2 3}}\n\nThe rest of the Leviathons arrived to Earth, but the heroes and the Goliathons managed to fight back. The Leviathon Mother made earthfall herself in order to end with the life of Kei Kawade herself.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 2 4}} The monster mother proved to be no match for Kei and the combined force of new monsters of his own creation, prompting most members of the Leviathon Tide to abandon her and flee Earth. A few remained on the planet, some having been defeated and captured and others managing to hide around the world.{{r|Monsters Unleashed Vol 2 5}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Giant Monsters]]"
