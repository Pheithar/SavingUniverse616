She-Hulk thought he was trying to harm her friend, and attacked.\n\nWhen She-Hulk became distracted, Talon and the X-Humed escaped in a hearse. Still rebelling, Changeling morphed into Elvis Presley to attract the attention of passing police officers. She-Hulk was able to catch up to the hearse and crash it, but was confused about Changeling's actions. He explained Talon couldn't control the four zombies completely at the same time and he was able to try and stop him; he had died a hero and wasn't about to change.\n\nThe four were given proper burials, their mouths filled with salt and sewn shut to prevent them from rising as zombies again.{{r|Sensational She-Hulk #34|35}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = The X-Humed briefly escaped in a hearse.\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/xhumedshehulk.htm Marvel Appendix]\n\n}}\n[[Category:Zombies]]\n[[Category:Undead]]"
