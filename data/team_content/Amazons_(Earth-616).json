The garrison left behind was slain, as the Atlanteans hated the warrior-women and wanted to avoid payment. Wishing to protect their power, the Atlantean's council of sorcerers tried to harness a fraction of the power of the [[Axis Mundi]], but were unable to control the energies, causing the [[Great Cataclysm]]{{r|Incredible Hercules #123}} (along with other causes).<!-- \n\nsomewhere:\n* Eaten by [[Echidna (Earth-616|Echidna]].{{r|Fearless Defenders #10}}?\n* Battling the [[Doom Maidens (Earth-616)|Doom Maidens]], and holding their ground.{{r|Fearless Defenders #2}} or #3?  -->\n\n===Hyborian Age===\nDuring the [[Hyborian Age]], at least three groups of women warriors were known as Amazons (though their relations to the Amazons are unknown, if any):\n* The foremost was the '''[[Amazons (Gamburu) (Earth-616)|Black Amazons]]''',{{r|King Conan #4}} also known as the '''Amazons of [[Gamburu]]''',{{citation}} in the kingdom [[Amazon (Black Kingdoms)|Amazon]], who were led by a queen always named \"[[Nzinga]]\".{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #97|; Leopard Men of Darfar}}{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #30|; A Gazetteer of the Hyborian Age: [[Amazons (Gamburu) (Earth-616)|Amazons]]' entry}}\n* Another was the eons-lived '''[[Warrior Women of Z'Harr Hr'ann (Earth-616)|Warrior Women]] of [[Z'Harr Hr'ann]]''', also known as \"'''White amazons'''\"<!-- verify --> (in contrast to the \"black Amazons\") or \"'''[[Vilayet]] Amazons'''\".{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #62|; The Temple of the Tiger}}\n* A third group were the (fair-skinned) '''Amazons''' led by [[Bryn (Earth-616)|Queen Bryn]], and living in the [[Valley of the Amazons]],{{r|Conan #10|; Queen of the Amazons!}} in the [[Secret City of the Amazons]].{{r|Conan #11|; Amazons!}}\n\n===[[Twelve Labors of Hercules]]===\nIn 1270 BC, [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] went to [[Themiscyra]], to steal the [[Hippolyta's Girdle|girdle]] of [[Hippolyta (Earth-616)|Hippolyta]] Queen of the Amazons, a gift from Hippolyta's father [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]]. However the moment the two met it was an instant attraction and the two went to bed together. This happiness from Hercules angered [[Hera Argeia (Earth-616)|Hera]], who took the form of one of the Amazons, and made them believe Hercules was kidnapping their queen. He escaped buck naked, carrying the girdle and chased by the countless Amazons.{{r|Incredible Hercules #122}}\n\n===[[Siege of Troy]]===\n<!-- {{r|Cable #96}} mentions the Amazons as well -->Hippolyta was eventually killed in a hunting accident by her sister [[Penthesilea (Earth-616)|Penthesileia]].
