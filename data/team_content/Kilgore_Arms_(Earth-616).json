After Quentin interrupted an arms control summit in [[Switzerland]] (which Kade's father was attending) by [[Telepathy|telepathically]] making the assembled diplomats reveal their dirtiest secrets on live television, Kade shot his father to death and dumped his body out of his flying car and into the mountains. With the resulting fear and general panic after Quentin's attack, The [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] then toasted the 12-year-old as their new [[Black King]].{{r|X-Men: Schism #1}}\n\nThe [[Kilgore Sentinel (Earth-616)|Kilgore Sentinel]] was produced by Kilgore Arms.{{r|Avengers A.I.
