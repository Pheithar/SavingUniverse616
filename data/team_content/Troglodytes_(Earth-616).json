Their presence near the castle alerted the attention of [[Skol (Earth-616)|Skol]] and his army of Troglodytes, a group of underground dwellers who were forced into living under the castle for centuries. They captured the Avengers and took them prisoner, where they were blamed for the barrier blocking their path as the Troglodytes used an underground entrance into the castle to steal food.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 115}}\n\nAfter battling a giant insect, and fighting off the attacking Troglodytes, Skol surrendered to the Avengers. The Avengers, however, decided to help the Troglodytes out by making arrangements with the British government to aid these underground dwellers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 115}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
