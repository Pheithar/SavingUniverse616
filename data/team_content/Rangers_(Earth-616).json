[[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] was being held captive by the villainous [[Jackson Day (Earth-616)|Corruptor]], who had the Hulk under his influence. Rick managed to sent a shortwave radio message to attempt to contact the Avengers.{{Citation}} \n\nThe message never reached the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] but instead five individuals intercepted the message and responded: [[Bonita Juarez (Earth-616)|Firebird]], [[Hamilton Slade (Rider) (Earth-616)|Phantom Rider]], [[William Talltrees (Earth-616)|Red Wolf ]],[[Victoria Star (Earth-616)|Shooting Star]], [[Drew Daniels (Earth-616)|Texas Twister]].{{Citation}}\n\nAlthough the five Southwestern adventurers were unable to stop the Hulk's rampage, they did enable him to defeat the Corruptor. At the battle's end, Texas Twister suggested that the five of them get together whenever a threat to the Southwest crops up. They agreed and took the collective name of the Rangers. However, because of the geographical separation among the members, the first incarnation of the Rangers didn't last long.{{Citation}}\n\nShooting Star's identity was at some point taken over by an unnamed demon in the employ of Master Pandemonium, who believed Firebird to be one of the possessors of his fragmented soul. To keep the Rangers from meeting regularly and perhaps posing a threat to him before he had completed his study of Firebird, Pandemonium dispatched the demon to take Shooting Star's place. Firebird nevertheless believed the demon to be hiding among the Avengers' West Coast branch and with her guidance the Rangers confronted the heroes, only to flush the demon in Shooting Star out of hiding. The demon claimed that Shooting Star was a human guise it had taken long before, that there never was a Victoria Star. The Avengers imprisoned the demon at their Compound and began an investigation of Master Pandemonium, but the Texas Twister, demonstrating a curious lack of concern, did not accompany them.{{Citation}}\n\nSoon, however, Texas Twister returned to the Avengers Compound at a time when Hawkeye was alone, demanding to see the captive demon. Twister declared his love for the demon, which turned back into Shooting Star. Texas Twister went on to explain that the demon had come to him months ago when Twister's powers seemed to be fading, making him afraid that he'd lose Shooting Star if their rodeo act broke up on account of his lost powers. The demon offered to augment the Twister's powers in exchange for his soul, and the Twister agreed, but after his powers were restored he begged to be spared, so the demon possessed Shooting Star instead, casting a spell that prevented Twister from telling anyone about this. Twister studied the occult until he found a means to expel the demon from Star.{{Citation}}\n\nThe demon then possessed Twister himself and battled Hawkeye and Shooting Star. Ultimately, Star threatened to kill the demon rather than allow the possession to continue, and the demon reluctantly imprisoned itself in a statue. Texas Twister and Shooting Star were reunited.{{Citation}}\n\nThe Rangers have recently registered as the official state super-team for [[Texas (State)|Texas]]. [[Miguel Santos (Earth-616)|Living Lightning]] and [[Antonio Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Armadillo]] have joined the original five. They recently helped protect the President of the USA from a [[Hydra]] attack.{{Citation}}\n\nDuring the Secret Invasion, Red Wolf's pet wolf Lobo was revealed to have been replaced by a Skrull. The Skrull was killed by the team after being discovered.{{Citation}}\n\n===Rangers===\n*[[Bonita Juarez (Earth-616)|Firebird]] - (Bonita Juarez)\n*[[Hamilton Slade (Rider) (Earth-616)|Phantom Rider]] - (Hamilton Slade)\n*[[William Talltrees (Earth-616)|Red Wolf]] - (William Talltrees)\n*[[Victoria Star (Earth-616)|Shooting Star]] - (Victoria Star)\n*[[Drew Daniels (Earth-616)|Texas Twister]] - (Drew Daniels)\n[[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|50-State Initiative]] Recruits:\n*[[Miguel Santos (Earth-616)|Living Lightning]] - (Miguel Santos)\n*[[Antonio Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Armadillo]] - (Antonio Rodriguez)\nPost-50-State Initiative Recruits:\n* [[Fifty-One (Earth-616)|Fifty-One]]\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Various types of firearms\n\n| Notes                   = \n* The Rangers' origin closely mirrors that of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].
