It operates from the [[Daily Bugle Building]] located on [[39th Street]] and [[Second Avenue]]. It was once one of the most read newspapers in the [[United States of America]].\n\n===Origin===\nFounded in 1897 on the streets of [[New York City|New York]], ''The Daily Bugle'' was a daily tabloid newspaper read by the citizens. The publication constantly edged out rival ''[[The Daily Globe]]'' to be the most read newspaper in the country.{{Citation}}\n\n===20th Century===\nIn the 1930's, [[Scoop Daly (Earth-616)|Scoop Daly]] worked for the Bugle, and he and other journalists working for it often became involved in the adventurer [[Night Raven (Vigilante) (Earth-616)|Night Raven's]] adventures. \n\n===[[World War II]]===\n[[Walter Jameson (Earth-616)|A man named Jameson]] worked for the Bugle, once almost catching a picture of an unmasked [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. This man later served as an editor, directing C. Thomas Sites. He served as publisher in 1945, when the Daily Bugle printed a story alleging, correctly despite official denial, that Captain America had been lost at sea.{{Citation}}\n\n===J. Jonah Jameson Inc.===\nThe long-time publisher of the Bugle, [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]], began his journalistic career as a reporter for the Bugle while still in high school. Jameson purchased the then-floundering Bugle with monies obtained from assets inherited, and turned the paper into a popular success. Other magazines published from time-to-time include the revived [[NOW Magazine (Earth-616)|NOW Magazine]] and the now-defunct [[Woman Magazine (Earth-616)|Woman Magazine]].\n\n[[File:Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616) from Daily Bugle Vol 1 1 Cover.jpg|left|thumb|Daily Bugle staff]]\nJ. Jonah Jameson, Inc. purchased the Goodman Building on 39th Street and Second Avenue in 1968 and moved its entire editorial and publishing facilities there. Now called the [[Daily Bugle Building]], the office complex is forty-six stories tall, and is capped by the Daily Bugle logo in 30-foot letter on the roof. There are loading docks in the rear of the building, reached by a back alley. Three floors are devoted to the editorial office of the Daily Bugle, two sub-basement levels for the printing presses, while the rest of the floors are rented.{{Citation}}\n\n===Anti-Spider-Man===\nThe newspaper is noted for its anti-superhero slant, especially concerning [[Spider-Man (Peter Parker)|Spider-Man]], whom the paper constantly smears as a part of its editorial policy. However, the Editor-in-Chief, [[Joseph Robertson (Earth-616)|\"Robbie\" Robertson]], the only subordinate to Jameson who is not intimidated by him, has worked to moderate it.{{Citation}}\n\n===The Pulse===\nDue to declining circulation, Jameson conceded to Robertson's objections and has created a special feature section of the paper called ''[[The Pulse]]'' which focuses on superheroes.  In addition, the paper also intermittently ran a glossy magazine called ''NOW Magazine.''{{Citation}}\n\nThe [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]] decided to strike a deal with Jameson regarding exclusive content in exchange for removing the strong Anti-Spider-Man vibe from the newspaper, to which Jameson agreed. Merely one day later, Jameson had already gone back on his word with [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]], using the headline \"a wanted murderer ([[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]), an alleged ex-member of a terrorist organization ([[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman]]) and a convicted heroin-dealer ([[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]]) are just some of the new recruits set to bury the once good name of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]\". This caused [[Jessica Jones (Earth-616)|Jessica Jones]] to sell the first pictures of her newborn baby to one of the Bugle's competitor's instead.{{Citation}}\n\n===DB!===\nRecently ''The Daily Bugle'' hit on hard times which led to it being offered by a buyout by [[Dexter Bennett (Earth-616)|Dexter Bennett]]. This forced Jonah to stop everyone's checks to build the capital needed to save the paper, with everyone at the Bugle working temporarily for free as a sign of solidarity. After Jonah Jameson suffered a heart attack, his wife sold the ''Bugle'' to Dexter Bennett, who changed the name to ''The DB'' and transformed it into a scandal sheet. However, the reputation of the ''DB'' plummeted down because of the new, scandalous angle Bennett gave it. \n\n===Front Line===\nSeveral reporters unwilling, or refusing the new course, like Peter himself, were forced to go away, finding a new safe haven in the ''Frontline'', the only magazine willing to accept people fired by Bennett, pursuing a scorched earth policy over them. The Daily Bugle was later destroyed by [[Electro]]. Later after their shares were reacquired from Bennett, Mayor Jameson turned the money over to Joe Robertson to have the Frontline offices remade into the [[Daily Bugle (Front Line) (Earth-616)|new Daily Bugle]].{{Citation}}\n\n<!-- ==Staff Members==\nIs this list necessary?\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100% border=1\n!| Character\n!| Job Title\n!| Employed/Seen working in\n!| Notes\n|- bgcolor=\"#DDDDDD\"\n| colspan=4 align=center | '''Current Staff Members'''\n|-\n|[[Joseph Robertson (Earth-616)|Robbie Robertson]]\n|Former Editor-in-Chief\n|{{Cnst|Amazing Spider-Man #51}}\n| Quit after becoming disgusted over Dexter Bennetts' new policies, learning of how the DB was indirectly responsible for the death of a woman shown on their paper.
