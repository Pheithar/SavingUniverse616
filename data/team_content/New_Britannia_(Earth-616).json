They lived on an island in Lake Lost Sinister. For generations, the chief Rob Christopher and Chief [[Neu Deutschlanders (Earth-616)|Neu Deutschlanders]] Heinrich Draco continued hostilities, using dinosaurs as vehicles of war, until [[Ka-Zar]] put an end to the war. Draco and Christopher apparently perished and their people sought peace. \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Savage Land Tribes]]\n[[Category:British Organizations]]"
