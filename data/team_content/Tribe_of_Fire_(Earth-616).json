Arriving in a lightweight plane, the tribe believed him a god, with the exception of [[Gahck (Earth-616)|Gahck]], the tribe's female chieftain. Gahck challenged Wolverine to combat, and once it was established that he wasn't a god, he offered to help their hunting parties. Logan subsequently started a relationship with Gahck. When members of the tribe were captured, Wolverine discovered that a robotic [[Tyrannosaurus rex]] would attack the tribe and take their members to a secret base. Wolverine discovered that experiments were performed on the tribe members by [[Apocalypse (Android) (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]], and after freeing himself and the captured Gahck, he battled Apocalypse, though it turned out to be an android. In the android's lab, Logan learned that [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]] was the man who had told him to journey to the Savage Land in the first place. Cyborgs resulting from the experiments ultimately rejoined the tribe.{{r|Wolverine: The Jungle Adventure Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * The idea that Wolverine had a son named [[Erista (Earth-616)|Erista]] originated from {{cl|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: X-Men 2004 Vol 1 1}}. The author indicated it was his intent to make Erista the same child glimpsed in {{cl|Wolverine: The Jungle Adventure #1}}, confirming for the first time the sex of the child and that it was Logan's. Although the author insisted the child's name and sex were pre-existing information,<ref>Statements by [[Eric J. Moreels]] on the now-defunct comixfan.net boards</ref> twelve years later it still appears as if Erista, son of Wolverine, was first named in the 2004 OHOTMU: X-Men.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Savage Land Tribes]]"
