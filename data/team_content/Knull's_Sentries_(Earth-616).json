Rather than kill them, Knull chose to forcibly recruit them into his [[Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)|Hive]] by infecting them with his [[Symbiotes|living abyss]].<!--{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}}-->\n\nThe trio were stationed on a planet Knull had conquered and tasked with guarding a portal from that planet to the [[Klyntar (Location)|Symbiote Throneworld]]. When the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] - displaced in time from billions of years in the future - arrived on the planet seeking aid, the three goddesses demanded that he leave - stating that his [[Power Cosmic]] was too bright. When the Silver Surfer did not heed their warning, the three goddesses attacked him and nearly succeeded in killing or infecting him with living abyss, but he conjured a star that burned away the living abyss cocooning the planet and separated them from their symbiotes - knocking them unconscious.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}}\n\nImpressed by the Silver Surfer's power, Knull dragged him through the portal to the Symbiote Throneworld and [[Void Knight (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|tried to claim him]] for the Hive, but the Surfer was freed by [[Egros (Earth-616)|Ego the Living Planet]]. Infuriated, Knull summoned the sentries to the Throneworld; and when they offered to hunt down the Surfer for him, Knull set off to do so himself and tasked them with guarding his throne-room.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2}}\n\nIt is unknown what happened to these goddesses following the symbiotes rebelling against and imprisoning Knull.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = The goddesses are capable of teleportation - both through the mage's magic and Knull's power.{{r|{{cl|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}}-[[Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 2|2]]}}\n| Weapons                 = One goddess wields a symbiote-augmented greatsword, another goddess wields a pair of warhammers fused to her arms by her symbiote, and the third goddess wields a magic staff.{{r|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Notes                   = * In the director's cut of {{cl|Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1 1}}, Donny Cates' script notes that while the goddesses have symbiotes, they should look as dissimilar from [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom]] as possible.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Symbiotes-possessed]]\n[[Category:Symbiote-Enhanced Organizations]]\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Knull Worshipers]]\n[[Category:Alien Gods]]"
