They were able to obtain ownership of the [[Baxter Building]] to use as their headquarters, and they hired [[Brenda Bannicheck (Earth-616)|Brenda Bannicheck]] as their manager and publicist.\n\nTheir first mission consisted of stopping the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]] from robbing [[Wilkinson's & Sons Jewelry]]. The team later learned that Brenda Bannicheck had actually staged the whole situation in order to get the team publicity, resulting in Bannicheck getting fired. Despite the return of the Fantastic Four, the Fantastix were allowed to remain the owners of the Baxter Building.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 4}}\n\nThe Fantastix saw little action during their subsequent career, mostly due to being stand-ins for the Fantastic Four with the Fantastic Four being around. When the powerful alien [[Cormorant (Earth-616)|Cormorant]] scoured the [[Earth]] in search for a mysterious artifact, he unceremoniously destroyed the entirety of the Baxter Building to unearth [[Container Zero]]. When the Fantastic Four, [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] and [[Zora Vukovic (Earth-616)|Victorious]] arrived to confront the Cormorant, the Fantastix joined the fight. After the destruction of Container Zero ended with the creation of the [[Forever Gate]] and the Cormorant left, [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] decided to reclaim what was left of the Baxter Building so his team could guard the portal. Despite being offered to help carry this duty, the Fantastix decided to leave it all to the Fantastic Four.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 25}}\n\n| Equipment               = Matching uniforms\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The Fantastix had an action figure line, but didn't pull enough revenue.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 25}}\n| Links                   = \n}}"
