The faux-Beatles were intended to take the place of the real [[Beatles (Earth-616)|Beatles]], and use their positions to launch a Skrull invasion. [[John Lennon (Skrull) (Earth-616)|John]], however, thought the Skrull Beatles could do more than an alien invasion, and convinced their bosses to give them free reign.\n\nMuch like the real Beatles, the Skrull Beatles eventually found their interests leading in different directions, leading to the band's break-up. They were all later revealed to have been killed,{{r|Captain Britain and MI-13 #1}} save for John, who died later.{{r|Captain Britain and MI-13 #4}}\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Musicians]]\n[[Category:Bands]]"
