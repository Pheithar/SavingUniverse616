He used them as pawns against the remaining members of Alpha Flight and the Fantastic Four. He lost control when [[Jeanne-Marie Beaubier (Earth-616)|Aurora]] used her own light powers on herself and freed her own mind and the other members eventually were freed as well.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 93|94}} \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
