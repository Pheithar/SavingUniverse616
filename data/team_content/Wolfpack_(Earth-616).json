The mysterious retired Naval [[Character Index/M#Mack|Mr. Mack]] selected them due to their extraordinary abilities and aptitude.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #31}}\n\nMr. Mack trained each of the team individaully from early adolescence into their late teens in  hand to hand combat, strategy, stealth, speed, endurance, and raw physical strength. When the time came, Mr. Mack gathered all his pupils and formed the Wolfpack to battle the [[Nine (Wolfpack) (Earth-616)|The Nine]] and their forces in South Bronx, in New York.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #31}}\n\nNone of the members had experience in team work, but after the death of Mr. Mack and the imprisonment of [[Samuel Weltschmerz (Earth-616)|Samuel Weltschmerz]] (one of their teammates and Mr. Mack's oldest student), they got together and won their first victory against the The Nine.{{r|Marvel Graphic Novel #31}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfpack_(Marvel_Comics)\n}}"
