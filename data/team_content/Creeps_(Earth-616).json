Rather than finding a healthy outlet for their loneliness, they began abducting children and imprisoning them in their basement. Once their prisoners died, the Creeps would simply go out and abduct another child to replace them.{{r|Scream: Curse of Carnage Vol 1 6}}\n\nThe Creeps once attempted to kidnap [[Jubilation Lee (Earth-616)|Jubilee]] when she first became a student at the [[Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]], though they fled when she noticed a nearby [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|police]] officer.{{r|Be X-tra Safe with the X-Men Vol 1 1}}\n\nYears later, the Creeps began abducting homeless teenagers and youths living at the [[Food, Emergency Aid, Shelter and Training (Earth-616)|F.E.A.S.T. Center]], beginning a manhunt by the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]], vigilantes like [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] and [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Scream]], and bounty hunters like the [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]] to apprehend those responsible. Oblivious to this, the Creeps met their end when they attempted to abduct a homeless boy called Basquait and were executed by [[Demogoblin (Earth-616)|Demagoblin]] - a demon whose fanatically religious cult Basquait was a member of.{{r|Scream: Curse of Carnage Vol 1 6}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Insanity]]\n[[Category:Grey Hair]]\n[[Category:Criminals]]"
