When the barbaric [[Warlord (Sakaar) (Earth-616)|Warlord]] forced them into a fighting trial known as the Gauntlet, the husband of the clan's leader [[Sharn (Earth-616)|Elder Sharn]] was presented as the clan's champion. He died in battle, and as a consequence, the Desert Sea Clan was absorbed into the Warlord's army.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 710}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
