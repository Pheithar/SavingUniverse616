Lobe recruited four [[Verre (Earth-616)|Verre]], [[Thug (Mutate) (Earth-616)|Thug]], [[Burst (Earth-616)|Burst]], [[Bouncing Betty (Earth-616)|Bouncing Betty]].\n\n===[[Nation X (Event)|Nation X]]===\nHe obtain somehow six [[Predator X|Predators X]] (but one get lose), enhanced them cybernetically, and infused them with nanomachine spies. He then led his team to capture [[John Greycrow (Earth-616)|Scalphunter]] and forced him to fly a jet containing the Predator X's to [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]]{{r|Uncanny X-Men #516}}. After the X-Men defeated the Predators, the nanomachines were released from the bodies and spied on all the mutants, analyzing the fighting styles, powers, and DNA. The nanobots then transmitted to Lube, who able to use it to enhance his team's capabilities, and give himself [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]]'s healing factor, with the ultimate goal being to replicate their powers for everybody on Earth.\n\nThe X-Men Wolverine, [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] and [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], helped by [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]] assaulted Lobe's building in [[New York City]]{{r|Uncanny X-Men #521}}. Once Fantomex destroyed Lobe's central computer, his team lost their fighting edge, and were defeated. Lobe then released [[HX-N1]], the influenza-based mutant plague and also a mutant powers suppressing, revealing that he was working using John Sublime's works and ideals. He and his team escaped, and his base exploded. The explosion was green like the plague gas, and was released high above the streets of [[Manhattan]] from a skyscraper, but that didn't seem to worry the X-Men at the time. The plague quickly infected numerous [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopian]] mutants.\n\n===Quarantine===\nAt this time, Lobe also debuted his imitation [[X-Men (Lobe) (Earth-616)|New X-Men]] in [[San Francisco]], five humans who were given copies of the original X-Men's powers using a genetically tailored drug{{r|Uncanny X-Men #530}}. Lobe then contacted [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and offered him the cure for the mutant plague in exchange for sole commercial rights to the mutant genome{{r|Uncanny X-Men #532}}, in order to use it to legally sell his mutant powers drug, the [[Xperience]]. \n\nWhile Lobe was showcasing an inhaler that could give an ordinary human mutant powers to shareholders, planning on commercializing mutant powers, the X-Men decided to break quarantine and confront Lobe, in order to save the small uninfected team of X-Men who was battling at this time against a crowd of powered potential buyers of the products. Lobe tried to subdue the X-Men with his virus, only to discover that anyone who breathed in his inhalant would be susceptible too. Therefore, he was forced to release his cure. Cyclops then promised Lobe that they will sue him for everything{{r|Uncanny X-Men #532|#534}}.\n| Equipment               =  \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = * [[HX-N1]]: The X-Flu, used to weaken and inhibit the [[Homo superior|mutant]] powers of 134 known mutants.\n* [[Xperience]]: A drug who give the powers of a defined mutant for a certain amount of time.\n| Notes                   = * The Sublime Corporation is seemingly a tribute from [[Lobe (Earth-616)|Lobe]] to his inspiration: [[Sublime (Earth-616)|John Sublime]], and not one of Sublime's creations and properties.\n* During the battle in the Triumph Hill Ballroom, [[Lobe (Earth-616)|Lobe]] fired [[Bouncing Betty (Earth-616)|Bouncing Betty]] for having been beat up again by the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
