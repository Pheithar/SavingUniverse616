Ms. Marvel had one condition: she wanted a covert strike team that could deal with super villains before they became Avengers-level  global threats. Stark agreed, and formed Operation: Lightning Storm.\nsup\nThe team was given full autonomy from the normal S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy, but was allowed the full use of S.H.I.E.L.D. resources, including senior agents, and a [[Minicarrier 13|Minicarrier]] to act as their mobile base. The core team consisted of Ms. Marvel, Agent Locke, Agent Baines, and Agent Sum.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 13}}\n\nOn their first mission, the team busted up an [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] research lab in [[Anderson (Indiana)|Anderson]], [[Indiana (State)|Indiana]], responsible for the detonation of a DNA-scrambling bomb. The subsequent actions involved a full battle between various A.I.M. factions in [[Seattle]]. The operation proved disastrous, though, leading to Agent Baines' death and Agent Locke's complete loss of Psi abilities.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 15|17}}\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D. offered up replacement agents in the form of new recruits [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]] and [[Sleepwalker (Earth-616)|Sleepwalker]]. Following a failed raid on the [[Raft]] prison, the team traveled to [[Chile]], where they broke up a kidnapping and slavery ring led by the [[Phillip Masters (Earth-616)|Puppet Master]].{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 18|20}}\n\nWhen Ms. Marvel was kidnapped by the alien creature [[Cru (Earth-616)|Cru]], the team gave chase to [[Monster Isle]], where they exterminated a new colony of [[Brood]].{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 21|24}}\n\nThe team returned to New York, where they were charged with the capture of Ms. Marvel for being a [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrull]] infiltrator as part of the [[Secret Invasion]]. The team captured two Ms. Marvels, and eventually worked out which one was the impostor. However, the impostor self-destructed while imprisoned on the Minicarrier, destroying the carrier and killing most of the team.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 2 26|27}}\n\n== Members ==\n* [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol Danvers (Ms. Marvel)]] - leader\n* [[Agent Locke (Earth-616)|Agent Locke]] (retired) - Psi Ops, General action\n* [[Agent Baines (Earth-616)|Agent Baines]] (deceased) - Technical\n* [[Hui Lin (Earth-616)|Agent Sum]] - Pilot, General action\n* [[Sleepwalker (Earth-616)|Sleepwalker]] - General action\n* [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]] - Technical, General action\n* Doc Farrell (deceased) - Medical support\n* [[Superhuman Restraint Unit (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.
