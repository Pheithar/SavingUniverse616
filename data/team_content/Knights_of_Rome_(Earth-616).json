Later sacrificing their souls to continue their mission, they were granted a degree of immortality, but left dessicated and seemingly trapped inside their mystical armor.{{r|Incredible Hulks #628}}\n\nWhen [[Romulus Augustulus (Earth-616)|Tyrannus]] later sought Pandora's urn for his own ends, the Knights of Rome moved against him, coming into conflict with the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] and [[Elizabeth Ross (Earth-616)|Red She-Hulk]]{{r|Incredible Hulks #627}} while kidnapping Romulus, Italian historian Dr. Sofia di Cosimo, and the Urn. Taking them back to their flying castle, the Knights were followed by the Hulks, with a battle erupting in the castle, during which they unleashed a mystical bird belonging to [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus]] before being attacked from behind by Romulus and seemingly defeated.{{r|Incredible Hulks #628}}\n\n| Equipment               = * Magic-enhanced titanium-armored suits.\n| Transportation          = * Flying castle\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Invoked the Roman names [[Zeus Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Zeus]] (Jupiter), [[Hephaestus Aetnaeus (Earth-616)|Hephaestus]] (Vulcan), and [[Hecate (Olympian) (Earth-616)|Hecate]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Orders of Knights]]"
