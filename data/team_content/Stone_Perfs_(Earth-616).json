They pursued the shooters, capturing the gang members.\n\nHawkeye then waged a one-man crime fighting campaign against the gang which was involved in the drug trade at the street level, disrupting their activities and protecting citizens from their harassment and violence. Meanwhile the vigilante Terminizer, followed him, killing any Stone Perfs that Hawkey encountered. Due to media attention, the crimelord whom they answered to, [[Lady Lotus (Earth-616)|Lady Lotus]] betrayed the gang, setting them up to be incinerated.{{r|Avengers Spotlight Vol 1 30|34}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/stoneperfsgang.htm\n}}\n[[Category:Gangs]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
