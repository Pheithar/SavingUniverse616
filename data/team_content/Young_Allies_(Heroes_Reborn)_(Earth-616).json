The  [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] return  home to [[Earth-616]] , but the planet suffers without the teams to protect it. One or two of Allies share code-names with heroes from the 616 team but have no relation to them.  The team first comes in contact with the [[Redeemers (Earth-616)|Redeemers]], who were backed by the U.S. government and work with the Thunderbolts.{{Citation}}\n\nThe Redeemers of Counter Earth was lead by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] but due to amnesia he had forgotten his time on the other Earth with the Allies [[Rebecca Barnes (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Bucky]]. The battle was caused by the Allies when they created a fake chemical weapons scare in [[Latveria]] in an attempt to force the ruler of Counter [[Victor von Doom (Counter-Earth) (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] to distribute food and medicine in a fairer way. When the team left, Bucky was left shocked that Captain America would believe she would really use the weapon, which made Captain America lie to Dr. Doom about the canister being hidden.\n\nThe team some time later encountered the [[Thunderbolts (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] themselves on their home world, while a rift was threatening to destroy both worlds. The Thunderbolts returned home but [[Helen Takahama (Earth-616)|Jolt]] stayed behind to work with the team.\n\nThe recent events to take place on  Counter-Earth involved the reality hopping team the [[Exiles (Multiverse)|Exiles]] who were there stop [[Kevin MacTaggert (Earth-616)|Proteus]], who was in their teammate [[Kevin Sidney (Earth-1081)|Morph]]'s body. Proteus at first tricked the the Young Allies into fighting  the Exiles. The Young Allies they later found out the truth when Proteus was enjoying torturing the Exiles. Proteus appeared to be winning, but two cosmic entities known as \"[[Order (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|O]]\" and \"[[Kaos (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Kay]]\" tore Proteus away from the Exiles saying \"that they've been waiting for him\". They they then  supply Proteus with an army of nuclear weapons.\n\nEmpress [[Dorma (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Dorma]] and Proteus soon meet, resulting in Proteus taking Dorma's crown and drying up [[Atlantis]], and killing her and all her soldiers. The Exiles with the help of the Young Allies arrived at Atlantis. Proteus launchs the nuclear weapons but with luck, [[Elric Freedom (Heroes Reborn) (Earth-616)|Kid Colt]] and Jolt stop the nuclear weapons without setting them off. Proteus believed he was still winning but as he still had Dorma's crown but  [[Clarice Ferguson (Earth-295)|Blink]] rigged it with a behavior modifier. The device  made Proteus to believe he was Morph. The Exiles then teleport back to [[Panoptichron]] and sent the last of the nuclear weapons into space. The Young Allies then thanked the Exiles for saving their world  and left for the next reality.{{Citation}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [[Wikipedia:Young_Allies#Modern_Day|Wikipedia: Young Allies]]\n}}\n[[Category:Heroes Reborn (1996 Event)]]"
