There, they saw the [[X-Men]] trying to leave taking Xorn with them. As the protectors of China, they felt Xorn was their responsibility and attacked the X-Men.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 158}} \n\nWhen Xorn's containment helmet cracked and opened the black hole, the Eight Immortals realized the destruction caused by Xorn wasn't the X-Men's doing and offered their assistance. Even though they didn't want to help the X-Men fight the Chinese military, in whose possession a spare containment helmet was, they guided the X-Men to the military base for safety.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #158|160}}\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\n\nAt least some of the members of the team appear to have super powers, though it's never revealed what's the source of those powers. All of them appeared to be skilled in the martial arts, most had body armor, and some of them carried weapons (hammer, swords, and a handgun).{{r|X-Men Vol 2 #158|160}}\n\nThe team member who had lost his legs was able to weaken [[Lorna Dane (Earth-616)|Polaris]] from a distance to the point that she felt like she was dying, causing her to collapse.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 158}} Another one who carried two swords was able to shatter the ice blasts that [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]] was sending his way and when he got encased in ice, he broke himself free by shattering the ice.{{r|X-Men Vol 2 158}} The lone female member of the group touched the soil with her hand, controlling vegetation which entangled [[Remy LeBeau (Earth-616)|Gambit]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 158}} \n\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Handgun, Swords, Hammer\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
