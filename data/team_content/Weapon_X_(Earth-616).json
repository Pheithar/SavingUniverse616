It was the tenth installment of the [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus Program]]. In the case of Weapon X, the mechanism was genetic engineering, specifically creating mutations in normal humans and enhancing preexisting mutations.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 23}} The successive projects had Roman numerals, so Weapon X was the tenth such project.{{r|New X-Men #145}} Some confusion has arisen because this same name has applied to several different projects as well as several of the project's \"graduates.\"\n\n===Before Weapon X: Weapon Plus===\nWeapon X was the tenth installment of the '''[[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus Program]]''' a military project started by the [[United States Government (Earth-616)|U.S. Government]] in 1945 after [[Truett Hudson (Earth-616)|Professor Thorton]], a civilian advisor to the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Army]], discovered the secret laboratory of [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Dr. Nathaniel Essex]] in a [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi]] concentration camp.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 23}} The program was designed to produce super-soldiers employable by the military, replicating the success provided by [[Project Rebirth (Earth-616)|Project: Rebirth]], retroactively rebranded '''Weapon I''', which gave birth to [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|New X-Men #145}}\n\nFollowing many unsuccessful attempts to create the perfect super-soldier, the criminal mastermind known as [[Romulus (Earth-616)|Romulus]] used his connections within the [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|C.I.A.]] to have the agency sponsor the tenth incarnation of the program,{{r|Wolverine: Origins #33}} named [[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X]], whose control was fully given to Professor Thorton.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 23}}\n\n[[File:Weapon X (Earth-616) from Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 73 001.jpg|left|thumb|First incarnation of the Weapon X Program with Dr. Cornelius and the Professor]]\n===Experiment X===\nThorton recruited former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|F.B.I.]] scientist [[Abraham Cornelius (Earth-616)|Abraham Cornelius]] and former [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Earth-616)|NASA]] operative [[Carol Hines (Earth-616)|Carol Hines]] to be part of the program's staff.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #72}}{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 23}} Under Romulus' orders, Thorton dispatched Weapon X agents to capture the [[Homo superior|mutant]] [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]], a former member of both the C.I.A.'s [[Team X (Earth-616)|Team X]]{{r|X-Men Vol 2 5|7}} under the codename '''Wolverine''' and the Canadian government's [[Department K (Earth-616)|Department K]],{{r|Logan: Shadow Society #1}} who Romulus chose as the first subject of the [[Adamantium]] bonding process, codenamed '''Experiment X'''.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #72}}\n\nAfter the initial phases of the experiment,{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #73|78}} Thorton and his collaborators found a way to project Logan's thoughts into a screen, observing the clash between Logan and [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] which happened after Logan's former love, [[Silver Fox (Canadian) (Earth-616)|Silver Fox]], was killed by Sabretooth on Logan's birthday.{{r|Wolverine: Exit Wounds #1}} In order to control Logan's behaviour and actions by using the several layers of false memories implanted by the C.I.A., Thorton and the Weapon X staff prepared a [[Weapon X Warehouse (Ontario)|warehouse]] in [[Ontario]] where they built elaborated scenarios and cinematographic sets to record additional false memories to be implanted into Logan's mind.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 50}} Having access to the C.I.A. files, Thorton recruited into Weapon X the other members of Team X, including [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Victor Creed]] a.k.a. '''Sabretooth''', [[Christoph Nord (Earth-616)|Sgt. David North]] known as '''Maverick''' and '''Wildcat''', [[John Wraith (Earth-616)|John Wraith]], operating as '''Kestrel''', '''Halcon''', or '''Carlisle''', [[Silver Fox (Canadian) (Earth-616)|Silver Fox]] (or a duplicate of her produced by either the C.I.A. or Romulus),{{r|Wolverine: Weapon X Files #1}} and [[Mastodon (Elefante) (Earth-616)|Mastodon]] a.k.a. '''Elefante'''.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 50}} These operatives became program subjects, receiving implanted memories through the Windsor scenarios,{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 50}} until Thorton contacted the psi-talent mutant mastermind named [[Aldo Ferro (Earth-616)|Aldo Ferro]], who could provide implanted memories through his psychic powers, avoiding spending resources and money to build elaborate stages. Ferro then joined Weapon X under the codename '''Vole'''.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 63}}\n\nHowever, Logan escaped the [[Weapon X Facility|Department K Facility]] where Weapon X scientists were experimenting on him,{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #79|84}} slaughtering several staff members including [[Dale Rice (Earth-616)|Dr. Dale Rice]],{{r|X-23 #1}} and nearly killing the head of security, [[Malcolm Colcord (Earth-616)|Malcolm Colcord]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 166}} causing the program to be temporarily put under the coverage of [[United States Department of Agriculture (Earth-616)|U.S. Department of Agriculture]]'s \"Pest Control Section\", of which Thorton was appointed director.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 50}} When [[Sublime (Earth-616)|John Sublime]], the former assistant of Dr. Cornelius who, in the meantime, had been promoted to Weapon Plus, notified Thorton that his superiors wanted to terminate the tenth incarnation, the Professor in turn decided to break Weapon X off from the Plus Program,{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 23}} being now funded only by the U.S. Agriculture Department.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 50}}\n\n===Department K===\nAfter Logan escaped from the Experiment X compound, Canadian Department K found a way to replicate his healing factor and implement it into other subjects, giving birth to a new iteration of the Weapon X Program. One of such subjects was [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Wade Wilson]], a man who suffered from cancer who had enlisted in Department K searching for a cure. Weapon X implemented healing factor in Wilson's body, temporarily regressing his cancer.{{r|Deadpool and Death Annual #1998}} Department K then formed an early installment of [[Weapon P.R.I.M.E. (Earth-616)|Weapon P.R.I.M.E.]] squad composed by Wilson, [[Bernard Hoyster (Earth-616)|Sluggo]], [[Garrison Kane (Earth-616)|Kane]] and [[Gregory Terraerton (Earth-616)|Slayback]]; they were later joined by Wade's girlfriend [[Vanessa Carlysle (Earth-616)|Vanessa Carlysle]], codenamed [[Copycat]]. Under unknown circumstances, Wilson killed Slayback during a mission;{{r|Deadpool Vol 1 1}} his health then got worse and worse, so he was taken to the [[Hospice]], a Weapon X Facility directed by [[Emrys Killebrew (Earth-616)|Dr. Emrys Killebrew]] and his assistant [[Francis Fanny (Earth-616)|Francis Fanny]], codenamed [[Ajax]]. There, Killebrew and Ajax made terrible experiments on Wilson, who was also tortured by Ajax. Adopting the name ''[[Deadpool]]'', Wade led a massive breakout from the Hospice, and the Canadian branch of Weapon X was shut down afterwards.{{r|Deadpool and Death Annual #1998}}\n\n===The Shiva Scenario===\nMany years later, Logan, now the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Man]] known as [[Wolverine]], started remembering events from his past, eventually leading him to the [[Weapon X Facility]] in [[Alberta]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 48}} At the same time, [[Silver Fox (Canadian) (Earth-616)|Silver Fox]], now a powerful leader of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]], had started secretly following U.S. Agriculture Department's activities, searching for the Professor in order to kill him for the treatment she received during her time at Weapon X.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 50}} Meanwhile, former [[Abraham Cornelius (Earth-616)|Dr. Cornelius]]' assistant [[Carol Hines (Earth-616)|Hines]] contacted the Professor at Agriculture Department, informing him that Logan had discovered something about his past at Weapon X.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 49}} After having read [[National Security Agency (Earth-616)|N.S.A.]] files provided by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Director [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]], Logan searched for the Professor in [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[Jamie L. Whitten Federal Building|Agriculture Department's Building]]; after Logan's visit, he decided to reach former Weapon X memory implants' set in [[Windsor (Ontario)|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], since he knew which could have been Logan's next place to visit. He then activated the [[S.H.I.V.A. (Earth-616)|S.H.I.V.A. Protocol]], a security program composed by several robot units used by Weapon X to capture agents which had escaped their control; Logan destroyed the first S.H.I.V.A. units and reached the Control Room, where he found Hines and the corpse of the Professor, who had been successfully killed by Silver Fox minutes before.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 50}}\n\nSabretooth was successfully found by a survivor S.H.I.V.A. unit in a Wrestling Club in [[New York City]]; he was helped by his former Team X teammate [[John Wraith (Earth-616)|John Wraith]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 60}} who also gathered Logan, Mastodon,{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 61}} Silver Fox and [[Carol Hines (Earth-616)|Carol Hines]] to reform the old Team X for the last mission: found the man who was behind their implanted memories: [[Aldo Ferro (Earth-616)|Aldo Ferro]]. They arrived in Ferro's private island in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (State)|Washington]], where they met their former teammate [[Christoph Nord (Earth-616)|Maverick]], who was employed by Weapon X Program to be Ferro's bodyguard.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 62}} After Ferro revealed that, during his time at Weapon X, had implanted false memories in all of their minds, Maverick rejoined Team X and, together, they fought Ferro, who killed Hines when she revealed he was an alien called the ''Psi-Borg''; then, he vanished bringing Silver Fox with him.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 63}} He then appeared, revealing his true form as the Psi-Borg and creating an illusory replica of Logan and Silver Fox's cabin in [[Yukon]]; then, he mentally controlled Sabretooth into killing Silver Fox for the second time, finally disappearing with Creed.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 64}} He will be later helped by Sabretooth escaping the United States.{{r|Sabretooth #1|2}}\n\n[[File:Weapon X Vol 2 \u00bd.jpg|left|thumb|A new Weapon X]]\n===The Director===\nAfter this Program's incarnation's failures, [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus]]' Director [[Sublime (Earth-616)|John Sublime]], contacted former Weapon X's head of security [[Malcolm Colcord (Earth-616)|Malcolm Colcord]], who had been nearly killed by Logan when he escaped after the Experiment X, offering him the position of Director at the new incarnation of Weapon X Program.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 23}}\n\nHe gave the project two additional goals: to monitor mutants in the general population and to set up concentration camps where they would be recruited, held for study, or executed. Colcord brought in Brent Jackson, a former agent of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], as well as Sabretooth, Deadpool, [[Vanessa Carlysle (Earth-616)|Copycat]], and [[Jean-Pierre Beaubier (Earth-616)|Mauvais]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 160}}\n\nThe new Weapon X team's first success was to psionically gain control of Wolverine and direct him to track down the \"alumni\" of previous Weapon X projects. They were forced to detain him, though, when he regained his volition. The [[Shiver Man]] freed Wolverine, upon which Colcord and the others fled.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 162|166}}\n\nColcord next brought in Box to build a concentration camp called [[Neverland]]. The Weapon X project had reached the height of its power. They recruited [[Jeanne-Marie Beaubier (Earth-616)|Aurora]], [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]], [[Mesmero (Vincent) (Earth-616)|Mesmero]], [[Marrow (Sarah) (Earth-616)|Marrow]], [[Kyle Gibney (Earth-616)|Wildchild]], Washout, Garrison Kane, and many more mutants. Some joined willingly. Most did not.\n\n[[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] organized the [[Underground]], a mutant movement to counter the atrocities going on at Neverland. With assistance from Agent Jackson, they led an assault on Neverland, in which Kane was killed. Jackson's help, however, was a ploy to help him take over the Weapon X project.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 #7|13}} Learning of the camp, the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] sent [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]] there undercover. Jackson ordered him to assassinate Sublime, at which point Chamber disappeared{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 #16|18}} -- as did everyone else at Neverland. The Weapon X project moved to another facility they named the Program.\n\nJackson scored another success when he subverted Maverick, who arrived at the Program in critical condition after a battle. In exchange for his life, Maverick agreed to another treatment and became Agent Zero. Now working for Jackson, he neutralized Marrow's team. Apparently considering the debt satisfied, he teamed with Wolverine and [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]] (a product of the Weapon XIII project) to uncover the truth about Weapon Plus. They found Neverland and the Program abandoned{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 21}} but managed to track down Sublime. Only then did Wolverine learn what had happened at Roanoke.\n\n[[File:Death of Wolverine - The Weapon X Program Vol 1 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|right]]\nA new Weapon X project, whose staff included [[Martin Sutter (Earth-616)|Dr. Martin Sutter]], [[Sarah Kinney (Earth-616)|Dr. Sarah Kinney]], and [[Zander Rice (Earth-616)|Dr. Zander Rice]] (son of [[Dale Rice (Earth-616)|Dale Rice]]), followed. They produced [[Native (Earth-616)|Native]], who was rescued by Wolverine and Sabretooth, and a female clone of Wolverine, [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]], who escaped after killing Rice and Kinney.\n\nLater, Colcord and Jackson appeared to be running separate, competing Weapon X projects. Also, Nathaniel Essex (Mister Sinister) was still working with the project, using the name Dr. Robert Windsor. Sinister's journal, chronicling his experiments in a Nazi death camp, inspired Thorton to work on one of the original projects; the full extent of Sinister's influence on the Weapon X programs is still unknown.\n\n===Weapons of Mutant Destruction===\nUnder the direction of [[William Stryker (Earth-616)|Reverend William Stryker]], a new Weapon X program emerged, which focused on the creation of undetectable killer cyborgs that could eventually eradicate mutantkind. These cyborgs were created from regular humans Stryker lured into his cause.{{r|Weapons of Mutant Destruction: Alpha Vol 1 1}} As part of the process to refine their cyborgs, Weapon X targeted several mutants with special abilities of their interest, namely [[James Howlett (Earth-21923)|Logan]], [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]], [[James Proudstar (Earth-616)|Warpath]], [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]], and [[Yuriko Oyama (Earth-616)|Lady Deathstrike]].{{r|X-Men Prime Vol 2 1}}\n\nOnce Weapon X captured Lady Deathstrike and harvested genetic material for their cyborgs, they sent their robots after the remaining four targets. While they failed to capture Logan and Sabretooth, they acquired tissue samples.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 1}} Meanwhile, Warpath was successfully apprehended.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 2}} By the time Weapon X's cyborgs attacked Domino, Logan, and Sabretooth had joined forced to investigate their attackers, and managed to rescue her. In order to improve the resistance and strength of the cyborgs, Weapon X set their sights on the [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Hulk]].{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 3}}\n\n[[File:Weapon X (Earth-616) from Weapons of Mutant Destruction Alpha Vol 1 1 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]\nEven though the cyborgs that attacked the Hulk managed to have a blood sample sent to their command center before being defeated and forced to self-destruct, their attack prompted Cho to investigate the situation and join forces with Weapon X's other targets. Data retrieved from a partially preserved cyborg allowed Hulk and his new allies to determine the location of one of the cyborgs' production centers.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 19}} When said facility was raided by Hulk and the mutants, Stryker had it self-destruct, killing its employees in the process. The mutants and Hulk survived, and even managed to rescue Warpath and Lady Deathstrike from containment.{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 4}} With the Hulk's blood sample still in their possession, Weapon X moved to the creation of mutant-Hulk hybrids.{{r|Weapons of Mutant Destruction: Alpha Vol 1 1}}\n\nAfter further investigating Weapon X, Hulk and the mutants located and raided their [[Weapon X Central Command|central command]], forcing most of the facility to be evacuated. Weapon X's leading scientist, [[Aliana Alba (Earth-616)|Dr. Alba]] had already finished experimenting on her best and last two subjects, [[Clayton Cortez (Earth-616)|H-Alpha]] and [[Robert Andrews (Earth-616)|H-Beta]],{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 6}} who were eventually released to confront the intruders. H-Alpha proved to be much less docile, to the point of killing H-Beta and attempting to turn on his creators. Hulk held him back, giving Stryker, Dr. Alba, and the remaining staffers the chance to flee in a helicopter. During the ensuing fight between Hulk and H-Alpha, Weapon X's central command collapsed.{{r|Totally Awesome Hulk Vol 1 22}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * \"Weapon #\" is normally used to denote specific known agents.
