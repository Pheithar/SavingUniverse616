They wore feathered head dresses and were savage fighters. They were discovered by African explorer [[Alvarez Monez (Earth-616)|Alvarez Monez]], and a number of the tribe was brought to America in his quest for ill gotten wealth and power. After murdering a number of rich men who refused to pay Monez's ransom requests, the Bird-Men clashed with the newly established costume hero the [[Allan Lewis (Earth-616)|Phantom Bullet]], who slew the tribe and their employer.{{r|Daring Mystery Comics Vol 1 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:African Tribes]]"
