Due to the lack of resources, she would be the only member until second order.{{r|Patsy Walker: Hellcat #1}}\n\n===Looking for [[Ssangyong Rexton (Earth-616)|Ssangyong Rexton]]===\nDuring her flight to join her base, Hellcat decided to visit [[North Spirit]]. She ended up fighting with magical bears{{r|Patsy Walker: Hellcat #1}} and a sea-monster until encountering seven witches in the [[Middle World]]. Hellcat agreed to help them locate and return their missing [[Ssangyong Rexton (Earth-616)|daughter]].{{r|Patsy Walker: Hellcat #2}}\n\nOn her journey, she banded with one of the magical bear, a water lemming, a talking stone calendar and a cat-like creature possibly going as \"Manslayer\".{{r|Patsy Walker: Hellcat #2}}{{r|Patsy Walker: Hellcat #3}} She eventually encountered the kidnapper of the witches' daughter on standing on a ship, separated from Hellcat and her group. Joined by an army of rabbits, she built a rabbit bridge to confront him and managed to aboard the ship.{{r|Patsy Walker: Hellcat #4}}\n\nDuring the ensuing fight, Hellcat and the \"kidnapper\" burst through a wall into the daughter's bedroom, where she revealed that he was his boyfriend. The daughter, named Ssangyong Rexton, then revealed the truth about the whole adventure, including that the talking stone calendar was her father.{{r|Patsy Walker: Hellcat #4}}\n\nExceeded by Ssangyong's obstination, Hellcat ended up punching her to move on. Leaving the ship, the band burst the car into an ice cliff.{{r|Patsy Walker: Hellcat #4}}\n\nShe eventually managed to convince Ssangyong to save them and sent them to the witches, after her father turned back to human form. After a quick brawl, the whole situation was debunked, and Hellcat returned to [[Anchorage]] for debriefing with Iron Man.{{r|Patsy Walker: Hellcat #5}}\n\n===[[Dark Reign]]===\nOffered commandment of the Initiative by [[Joseph Green (Earth-616)|Gauntlet]] (who had become its leader but didn't felt qualified), Hellcat refused, intending to return to her duty in Alaska. After [[Thor Odinson (Ragnarok) (Earth-616)|Thor's clone]] awakened, Hellcat battled it along with the other Initiative members present at [[Camp Hammond]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #21|22}} She also helped rescue the endangered civilians once the brawl was over, until [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] came to announce the camp closure.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #23}}\n\nUnnoticed by [[H.A.M.M.E.R.
