They were specifically picked due to being outside Iron Man's regular support network in order to avoid tipping off Korvac. These heroes consisted of [[Isaac Christians (Earth-616)|Gargoyle]], [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]], [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]] and [[Eugene Patilio (Earth-616)|Frog-Man]].\n\nThe team nearly died during their first outing. Investigating a massive radiation signature they believed to be Korvac's space ship, the heroes were lured to a decoy spacecraft that detonated.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 5}} They only survived due to Gargoyle using his powers to shield his teammates.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 6}} They returned to Iron Man and Hellcat, who had confronted Korvac in the meantime. Korvac had broken Stark's neck, so his allies tinkered with his armor to help it hold him together. The heroes were then joined by [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|War Machine]], who had escaped from Korvac's grasp, and they took off to space to race Korvac to ''[[Worldship (Taa II)|Taa II]]'', where the android intended to reclaim the [[Glossary:Power Cosmic|Power Cosmic]] and ascend to godhood.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 7}}\n\nDuring the chase, Stark's allies sent an SOS which was heeded by [[Wilbur Day (Earth-616)|Stilt-Man]], who had stationed himself on an alien planet. He secretly used a teleporter beam to suddenly pluck Iron Man away to his space colony, [[Megiddo (Space Colony)|Megiddo]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 11}} Tony's team continued pursuing Korvac and locked in combat with his ship until they managed to evade him.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 8}} Although Hellcat managed to telepathically reach out to Stark in Megiddo, she decided to take his team to ''Taa II'' and stop Korvac without him if necessary.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 10}} After defeating Stilt-Man, Iron Man and his newfound ally, [[Colin Richard (Earth-616)|Avro-X]], were facilitated the arrival at ''Taa II'' by the [[Adam Warlock (Earth-19141)|Living Tribunal]].{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 11}} Stark and Avro-X intercepted Korvac but were defeated, which also resulted in Avro's death. Tony's team subsequently arrived and helped Tony continue pursuing Korvac. At Frog-Man's request, Iron Man decied to name the team. Under the influence of morphine due to his injuries, Stark named it the Space Friends. The Space Friends were also joined by the original [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] after freeing him from Korvac's mind-control.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 12}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * {{cl|Iron Man Vol 6}} writer [[Christopher Cantwell]] once stated on Twitter that he had wondered what to name this team, and all he could think of at the time was \"the Alternates.\"{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ifyoucantwell/status/1346174775786262528|title=Christopher Cantwell on Twitter: \"Also been wondering what this ...|work=Twitter|first=Christopher|last=Cantwell|date=4 January 2021|accessdate=14 January 2021}}}}\n* [[Eugene Patilio (Earth-616)|Frog-Man]] was the main proponent for the team being named. His suggestions were \"Star Warriors\" and \"God Fighters.\" [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]] shot down the first idea arguing it sounded too close to ''{{WP|Star Wars}}''.{{r|Iron Man Vol 6 7}}\n| Links                   = \n}}"
