Executive Board (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D. Board]] meeting; however the real Stark arrived dressed as Iron Man, revealing the imposter's identity as Roxxon executive Simon Krieger. While Krieger was in prison, President Jones had him killed by one of his men; later, at a Board meeting, he officially changed Republic Oil's corporate name into ''Roxxon Oil Corporation''.{{r|Iron Man: The Iron Age #2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
