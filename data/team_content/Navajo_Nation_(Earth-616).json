The first Navajo were believed to have migrated into the south-west as early as 200 AD and expanded into the states of [[Arizona (State)|Arizona]], [[New Mexico (State)|New Mexico]], and [[Utah (State)|Utah]].<ref>[[Wikipedia:Navajo people|Wikipedia]]</ref> Presumably, their history on [[Earth-616]] mirrors that of their real world counterparts.\n| History                 = \n===American Frontier===\nThe colonization of the United States by European settlers caused great changes among the Navajo people. They often worked with or against settlers that were expanding in their region, occasionally fighting with or against such western heroes as the [[Matthew Masters (Earth-616)|Black Rider]], [[Blaine Colt (Earth-616)|Kid Colt]], and others, depending on their needs at the time. In later years many tribes strove for peace in order to prevent further bloodshed, but some renegade factions of the Navajo waged war against the white settlers.\n\nOne such renegade group of Navajo attacked a stage coach but were driven off by Kid Colt. Their leader [[Black Cloud (Earth-616)|Black Cloud]] sent his warriors [[Black Bear (Earth-616)|Black Bear]] and Running Deer to capture Kid Colt. They tortured him and then eventually attempted to burn him at the stake, however Kid Colt broke free and sent them fleeing into a dead end valley where they were trampled to death by a herd of buffalo.{{r|Kid Colt Outlaw #12}}\n\n===Modern Age===\nThe Navajo people continue to exist to this day. \n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Native American Tribes]]"
