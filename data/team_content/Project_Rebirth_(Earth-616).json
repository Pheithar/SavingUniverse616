Its success allowed the concept to grow and expand, becoming the larger operation known as [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapon Plus]].{{r|New X-Men #145}}\n\n===Origin===\n[[File:Steven Rogers (Earth-616) from Captain America Comics Vol 1 1 0001.png|thumb|left|The project working on [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]], [[Captain America]].]]\nIn February 1941, [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi]] scientists; [[Abraham Erskine (Earth-616)|Dr. Abraham Erskine]], [[Hans Bruder (Earth-616)|Professor Hans Bruder]] and [[Eric Schmitt (Earth-616)|Professor Eric Schmitt]] worked for [[Project Nietzsche (Earth-616)|Project Nietzsche]]. They hoped to create the first \"Ubermensch\" Dr. Erskine however defected to the [[United States of America]].{{r|Marvels Project #2}} \n\nNow in the US the project began as a collaboration between [[American]] and [[British]] governments. He was given the code name of \"Joseph Reinstein\"{{r|Giant-Size Invaders Vol 1 1}} and became the primary source of the American program. Dr. Erskine independently created both the chemical portion of the project, the [[Super-Soldier Serum]], that has been recreated to certain degrees, as well as the [[Glossary:Vita-Rays|Vita Ray]] housed in the [[Vita-Ray Chamber]] treatment that has not been recreated since.\n\n===Prototypes===\nThe project created two failed subjects: [[Clinton McIntyre (Earth-616)|Clinton McIntyre]], a.k.a. Protocide, and [[Adriana Soria (Earth-616)|Adriana Soria]], a.k.a. Queen. Protocide was placed in suspended animation and was revived in the modern era by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]]{{r|Captain America Annual #2000}} Queen was the first [[Homo superior|mutant]] experiment. Experimentation on her seems to have occurred prior to the serum being tested on Steve Rogers.{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 #15|20}}\n\n===Captain America===\nErskine continued to refine the process and eventually succeeded in being able to convert frail [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steven Rogers]] into the first Super Soldier. Rogers took the name Captain America. But Erskine was murdered moments after Rogers was successfully empowered. All of the refinements Erskine had made to the program were lost with his death, as he never fully documented all of his research to the recorded notes. What had made the process successful with Rogers, especially the [[Vita-Ray Chamber|Vita-Ray portion]], could not be recreated at the time. [[William Burnside (Earth-616)|William Burnside]] (a.k.a. [[Captain America|Steve Rogers II]]) eventually found and used the chemical portion of this process to become the Captain America of the 1950s.{{r|Captain America #155}}\n\n===Camp Cathcart===\nWith Erskine's murder, [[Wilfred Nagel (Earth-616)|Wilfred Nagel]] took over the American program under the code name of Josef Reinstein. Nagel's attempt to recreate Erskine's successful process with Rogers, did not succeed in mass production. Nagel's early attempts to recreate Erskine's successful chemical formula resulted in African-American super soldiers (most prominently [[Isaiah Bradley (Earth-616)|Isaiah Bradley]]). Three hundred African-American soldiers were taken from [[Camp Cathcart]] and subjected to potentially fatal experiments at an undisclosed location in an attempt to recreate Erskine's successful Super-Soldier Formula. Only five men survived the original trials; hundreds of test subjects left behind at Camp Cathcart and the camp's commander were executed by US soldiers in the name of secrecy. The families of the three hundred were told that they had died in battle.{{r|Truth: Red, White & Black Vol 1 #1|7}}\n\nWhile Nagel failed to create a working mass-production version of Erskine's formula, Nagel did make relatively successful samples, such as the one that kept then [[Walker Price (Earth-616)|Colonel Walker Price]] younger than his chronological age and still muscular and fit into his 90's.{{r|Truth: Red, White & Black #7}}\n\n===Josiah X===\nAlthough there were many later attempts to recreate or reverse-engineer Operation: Rebirth's Super-Soldier Serum in detail, none are known to have been involved with Weapon Plus, nor have been successful in replicating the missing Vita Ray portion. The exception was an attempt which resulted in the creation of Isaiah Bradley's son [[Josiah al hajj Saddiq (Earth-616)|Josiah X]]. Weapon Plus considers Steven Rogers its most successful creation.{{r|The Crew #4|7}}\n\n===Project Rebirth 2.0===\nA second Project Rebirth later began as an offshoot of the [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|Sym-Soldier Program]], a super-soldier operation using captured [[Symbiotes]] to create super-soldiers.{{r|Venom Vol 4 1}} After capturing the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]], Project Rebirth 2.0 attempted to bond it to military hosts to create \"Agent Venom\" - killing [[Cal Henriksen (Earth-616)|Cal Henriksen]] after he lost control before succeeding with [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Corporal Flash Thompson]], who was initially signed up for 20 missions.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 654}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 1}} Project Rebirth 2.0 came into conflict with [[Bennett Brant (Earth-616)|Crime Master]]'s syndicate and was raided by the [[Adriana Soria (Earth-616)|Spider-Queen]]'s horde during the [[Spider-Island (Event)|Spider-Island]] incident.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #670}} Upon being made aware of Project Rebirth 2.0's existence, Captain America personally shut it down,{{r|Venom Vol 2 10}} and its resources were appropriated by [[Project Venom (Earth-616)|Weapon V]].{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe [[Mercury Team (Earth-616)|Mercury Team]] was created in response to Project Rebirth 2.0's successes and failures with Agent Venom.{{r|Carnage, U.S.A. #2}}\n| Equipment               = \n\n* '''[[Super-Soldier Serum]]'''\n* '''[[Vita-Ray Chamber]]'''\n* '''[[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom Symbiote]]'''\n* '''[[Symbiote Inhibitor]]'''\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n* The original history wrongly states Rogers was the only test subject with no one else involved before him.{{r|Captain America Comics #1}}{{r|Captain America #119}}{{r|Captain America #255}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Government Organizations]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]\n[[Category:Allied Organizations]]\n[[Category:British Organizations]]\n[[Category:Weapon Plus Projects]]\n[[Category:Super-Soldier Programs]]"
