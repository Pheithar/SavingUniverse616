It warred with the British and the loyalist paramilitary groups (the Protestants). As the fighting continued, they realized that they needed financing to carry on the fight. Like the other paramilitary groups, they turned to smuggling cocaine for the Colombians and within Belfast itself the drug trade, prostitution, loan-sharking, and porngoraphy. Since the ceasefire, the political conflict mutated into a gang war over territory.{{r|Punisher Vol 6 18}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Irish Organizations]]"
