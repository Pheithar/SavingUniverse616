Revolted with this affront, the Verendi then unleashed an all-new team of [[Reavers (Earth-616)|Reavers]], composed of biomechanically augmented mercs and criminals recently maimed by mutants, against the [[Marauders (Pryde) (Earth-616)|Marauders]], successfuly causing an international incident that resulted in the Marauders being banned from Madripoor.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 17|18}}\n\nWith their protectors gone, the people of Lowtown were pillaged and had their houses destroyed by the Reavers, but the Marauders sent a small team of [[Morlocks (Earth-616)|Morlocks]] into the city to fight the Reavers and keep the peope safe one more day.{{r|Marauders Vol 1 19}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Hellfire Club Projects]]"
