They were confronted by [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Iron Patriot]] who, after being incapacitated by the Corps, asked them to become his bounty hunters. Eager to regain a purpose, the Gamma Corps agree.{{r|Dark Reign: Made Men Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe Gamma Corps were later attacked by a haywire [[Gammon (Earth-616)|Hulk A.I.]], who wanted to kill them as part of the plan of the original Hulk to neutralize every Gamma-powered mutate from the Earth, even though the original Hulk's plan didn't include lethal force. After following the haywire A.I. to [[Fort Knox]], Hulk saved the Gamma Corps from their deaths, but later stripped them of their powers.{{r|Hulk Vol 3 15}}\n\n===The Gamma Corps===\n* [[Brian Talbot (Earth-616)|Grey]] - (Brian Talbot)\n* [[Eliot Franklin (Clown) (Earth-616)|Griffin]] - (Eliot Franklin)\n* [[Nichole Martin (Earth-616)|Mess]] - (Nicole Martin)\n* [[Gideon Wilson (Earth-616)|Mister Gideon]] - (Gideon Wilson)\n* [[Timothy Wilkerson (Earth-616)|Prodigy]] - (Timothy Wilkerson)\n\n| Equipment               = Prodigy designed all the equipment for the team.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Prodigy had also designed and made high-tech weapons for the team as well.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_Corps\n}}\n[[Category:Super-Soldier Programs]]"
