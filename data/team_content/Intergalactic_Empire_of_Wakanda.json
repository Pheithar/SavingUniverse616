While exploring the [[Vega (Star System)|Vega System]], the explorers' travels took them through a temporal anomaly into the past, where they established an empire named after their homeland.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 12}}{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 15}} It was built over the next two-thousand years and came to span five galaxies beginning with the [[Benhazin System]] and expanding into [[T'Chaka's Reach]], which was taken from the [[Rigellians]] by force. The Wakandans then moved into the [[S'Yaan Expanse]], wiping out its original inhabitants without mercy, before taking the [[Matrix of Mamadou]] from the [[Kronans]], [[Symbiotes]], and [[Shadow People]], though not without considerable losses. Finally [[Nehanda's Lattice]] was added to the empire, the dominant [[Teku-Maza]] enslaved like the Kronans before them, and forced to work in the [[Vibranium]] mines.{{r|Black Panther Vol 7 4}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Wakandan Organizations]]\n[[Category:Empires and Civilizations]]\n[[Category:Interplanetary Organizations]]"
