They provided [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] with mystical power. As part of his bargain, he took the soul of his old lover [[Valeria (Latverian) (Earth-616)|Valeria]] by placing a special necklace on her and swore to acknowledge his subservience to the demons for his magical gifts. In exchange, the Three gave Doom a mystical armor comprised of his lover's own skin and flesh, greatly enhancing his mystical powers.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 69}}\n\nDoom then attacked the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], having offered to give the Haazareth Three their souls as well before casting Franklin Richards into Hell. During that time, The Three mentally tortured [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]] while Doom took delight in magically torturing the Fantastic Four before delivering their souls.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 70}}\n\nHowever, [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] tricked Doom into boasting of his prowess over his demonic benefactors, and the Three angrily grabbed Doom through the [[Orb of Agamotto]] to their dimension. The Fantastic Four followed and were able to free Franklin.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 71}}\n\nThe Three tortured Doom and mentioned [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] as their 'master'. However, Mister Fantastic soon rescued Doom out of fear he would conquer the realm in due time and banished him to a 'Moebius dimension.'{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 507}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/haazareththree.htm\n}}\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Demonic Organizations]]"
