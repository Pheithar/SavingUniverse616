After the [[Mena Ngai|vibranium meteor]] fell, a number of [[Wakandans]] were painfully mutated into \"demon spirits\" and began attacking their fellow Wakandans. [[Bashenga (Earth-616)|Bashenga]] became the first \"[[Black Panther]]\" known after his [[Black Panther (1,000,000 BC) (Earth-616)|prehistoric ancestor]] and closed the [[vibranium]] mound to outsiders, forming a religious cult that guarded the mound and fought to keep the \"demon spirits\" from spreading across the kingdom.{{r|Black Panther Vol 1 7}}\n\nThe Black Panther is a ceremonial and religious title given to the chief of the African nation of Wakanda. In addition to ruling the country, he is also chief of its various tribes (collectively referred to as the Wakandans). The [[Panther Habit]] is a symbol of office as well as a religious vestment.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 30}}\n\nAs part of the cult's ceremonies, A chosen Black Panther is entitled to the use of a [[Heart-Shaped Herb]] that grants the person who consumes it enhanced strength, agility, and perception.{{r|Black Panther Vol 3 24}}\n\nThe fallen Black Panthers are sent to rest in the city of [[Necropolis]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 608}}\n| Equipment               = [[Panther Habit]], [[Vibranium]], [[Heart-Shaped Herb]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Wakandan Cults]]"
