They were created by the leading communist government to combat superhuman threats and disasters and to counter the growing number of heroes being formed in the west and especially the [[United States of America]]. Each member of the team is assigned a code-name from the Chinese Zodiac.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 2}} \n\n===Events===\nWhen their member [[Dei Guan (Earth-616)|Dei Guan]], known as the Jade Dragon, appeared in Canada after mysteriously disappearing, China Force was sent to retrieve him. While en route, they fell under the influence of the [[Dreamqueen (Earth-616)|Dreamqueen]] and were diverted to West Edmonton Mall.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 64|66}} There, they fought Alpha Flight, mistakenly thinking that they were in China. After the battle, the team returned to China with Guan after [[Laura Dean (Earth-616)|Pathway]] opened a trans-dimensional portal.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 64|69}}\n\nAfter returning to China, Guan officially defected from China Force and became a member of a small resistance group ([[3Peace (Earth-616)|3Peace]]) who opposed China's approach to super-humans. China Force battled against the group and the Mutant Liberation Front. During the battle, [[Rabbit (China Force)_(Earth-616)|Rabbit]] was killed by Reignfire.{{r|X-Force Annual Vol 1 3}}\n\nThey have since been apparently disbanded and been replaced by the [[People's Defense Force (China) (Earth-616)|People's Defense Force]].{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 27}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n* There apparently have been several members who have defected from China Force; a list which may include [[Tang Jhimon (Earth-616)|Silver]] and Auric, who defected to Canada. \n| Trivia                  = \n* Members of the team are named after the Chinese zodiac.\n| Links                   = * http://marvel.com/universe/China_Force\n}}"
