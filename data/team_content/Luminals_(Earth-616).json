The Luminals mostly fought an entity known as the [[Abyss (Cosmic Sorcerer) (Earth-616)|Abyss]], who is able to turn organics into zombies. Though they thwarted his schemes many times, the Abyss' uncanny ability was to escape from even the most secure prisons. In a desperate gambit to rid themselves of the Abyss, the Luminals brought his prison to Knowhere, a city contained in the giant severed head of Celestial, to cast it into the Rip, a line where the laws of physics don't apply and all matter and energy become nonexistent. Unfortunately, the Abyss began to break out of his prison and began causing a reign of terror on Knowhere. The Luminals somehow managed to survive, while Knowhere's chief of security, [[Cosmo (Dog) (Earth-616)|Cosmo]], saved the unaffected in a dimensional envelope. Unfortunately, after a few days, the Luminals succumbed to the Abyss' control. Only the timely arrival of [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] was able to seal the Abyss back in his prison, using the transmode virus he was infected with to repair the mechanisms of the Abyss' prison.{{r|Nova Vol 4 8|9}}\n\n[[Lena Sendak (Earth-616)|Lena Sendak]] later became the new Cynosure and leader of the Luminals and they clashed with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] who had set up their headquarters on Knowhere when a Skrull infiltration had everyone on high alert. She sent her Luminals to hunt down [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax]] who had gone rogue.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 4|6}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = The Luminals are Xarth Three's equivalent of the Avengers.{{r|Nova Vol 4 8}} It is a large organization, with at least 50 members from dozens of alien species.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 22}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
