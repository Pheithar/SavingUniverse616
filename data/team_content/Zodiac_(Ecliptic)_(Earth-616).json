The full origins and details behind the new Zodiac remain unrevealed. Their leader, another man calling himself Scorpio, wielded a weapon reminiscent of the original Zodiac Key, but its origins remain unrevealed as well. Scorpio and his team were guided by the old woman known only as [[Ecliptic (Earth-616)|Ecliptic]], who had the ability to foretell the future.\n\nIn the Zodiac's first known mission in which they were hired by the Canadian government's [[Department H]] to fight the latest incarnation of their sponsored team, [[Alpha Flight]]. In doing so, Scorpio led the group in framing a militant special interest group. Alpha Flight discovered the truth and confronted the Zodiac. During the battle, the Zodiac's Virgo disappeared while fighting the Flight's [[Arlette Truffaut (Earth-616)|Murmur]]. Enraged, Scorpio ordered he team to kidnap the Flight's [[Madison Jeffries (Earth-616)|Madison Jeffries]] before escaping, and he went on to sever ties with Clarke, his contact with the Canadian government. The Zodiac only returned to Department H in order to steal the powerful the [[Nth Projector]], a device capable of allowing interdimensional travel, although the device was stolen from the Zodiac in turn by [[Imus Champion]].\n\nThis version of the Zodiac was later confronted by the mercenary team [[Weapon X (Team)|Weapon X]], who was intent on recruiting Madison Jeffries for themselves. Jeffries had since been brainwashed into serving the Zodiac as their version of Gemini. The members of Weapon X kidnapped Madison Jeffries, killing the other members of the Zodiac.\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/zodiacaf.htm\n* http://alphanex.alphaflight.net/index.php/Zodiac\n}}"
