However, after the untimely death of [[Chompsky (Earth-616)|Chompsky]], Allene became disenchanted with [[Homo sapiens|humanity]]. Without [[Doreen Green (Earth-616)|Doreen]]'s moral compass, Allene chose to use her powers to rid the [[Earth]] of humans (and humanoids) and make squirrels the dominate species. Allene used the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]]'s duplication chamber to [[clone]] an army of approximately 62,000 squirrels.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Beats Up the Marvel Universe!

Vol 1 1 002.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The Squirrel Revengers Initiative taking down the electrical grid]]\n\nTogether, Allene and her duplicate squirrel army destroyed the country's electrical grid and then systematically defeated nearly all of the heroes and villains of the [[Earth-616|Marvel Universe]]. Although their plans nearly succeeded, they were thwarted by Squirrel Girl, [[Tippy-Toe (Earth-616)|Tippy-Toe]], and their friends.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Beats Up the Marvel Universe! Vol 1 1}}\n\nAs part of a compromise, Allene and her duplicate squirrel army were sent to the [[Negative Zone]] to explore, battle villains, and found a squirrel utopia.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Beats Up the Marvel Universe!
