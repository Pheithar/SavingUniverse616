At this time, very little is known about the Order save that they maintain a vested interest in the vampire hunter, [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]], and have compiled an extensive dossier on Blade's activities. One of the more important men associated with the Order is [[Lucas Cross (Earth-616)|Lucas Cross]], Blade's biological father. Lucas' role in the order has yet to be clearly defined.{{r|Blade Vol 4 1}}\n\nRecently, a prophecy has emerged directly relating to Lucas Cross and his Dhampir offspring.\n\n'''Prophecy:'''<br>\n::''A father in chains''<br>\n::''Freed by a son not yet birthed<br>\n::''Will Unlock Vlad's remains<br>\n::''Upon the salted Earth<br><br>\n::''After his vampire urge is sated<br>\n::''Upon drinking of virgin essence<br>\n::''His resistance now abated<br>\n::''Upon learning of father's presence<br><br>\n::''Returning essence lost<br>\n::''From those undead in graves<br>\n::''At immortal living's cost<br>\n::''To the man known as Blade''<br>\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Earth Religions]]"
