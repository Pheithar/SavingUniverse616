His new powers allowed him to create humanoid plant-life in [[Manhattan]] that would fight by his side, by quickly growing seeds in water. He named these beings \"Sprout Soldiers and they were resistant to even bullets, although a very strong physical attack or strong herbicides could kill them, something that was discovered by [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] and [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Doctor Nemesis]]. As the two finished dealing with the Sprout Soldiers, [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] increased the temperature of the water where they were breeding after subduing Plantman, resulting in their destruction.{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 2|3}}\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\n===Powers===\n* '''Superhuman Durability''': They are impervious to bullets.{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 3}}\n\n===Weaknesses===\n* '''Nano-Herbicides''': Nano-herbicides, capable of destroying plants at a very small-scale, can also kill Sprout Soldiers.{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 3}}\n* '''Water dependency:''' They require water at normal temperature to breed.
