The company was operated by a man named Abner Skrooney, who also employed a man named Jesse as the station dispatcher. The Quick Cab Co. is noted for hiring one of its less reliable taxicab drivers, Jake Lockley. What neither Abner nor Jesse realized however, was that Jake Lockley was actually but one of three alternate aliases used by the masked vigilante [[Moon Knight]]. Despite Skrooney's dislike of Lockley's aloofness, he kept him in his employ for several years.\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Companies]]"
