They also helped in the recovery of stolen property for a wide array of clientele, from large insurance companies to small countries.{{Citation}}\n\nSilver Sable witnessed her mother\u2019s death as a young girl at the hands of terrorists, providing her drive to become leader of the group. Silver Sable joined the team at the young age of 17 and was quickly promoted to second in command. Ernst Sablinovia later left the team to finally track down his wife's murderer. Silver Sable and the Pack eventually catch up with him, but only to see the villain kill her father and escape with the body. Silver Sable assumed command of the Wild Pack while believing her father to be dead.{{Citation}}\n\nOver the years the number of war criminals declined so the team put their sites to other endeavors, by selling their services to the highest bidders. The team later gained the approval of the Symkarian government, which in turn provided a major source of outside income for [[Symkaria]]. The Wild Pack was made of skilled mercenaries or soldiers of fortune, and Silver Sable maintained a base of operations in New York City.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #265}}\n\nSilver Sable encountered the masked hero Spider-Man on several occasions, and respected his skills enough to seek his assistance as a freelance operative. She also recruited his reformed former nemesis, the Sandman, on a more regular basis.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #279|281}} \n\nOn one occasion, Silver Sable and Sandman worked with Spider-Man to set up one of their targets. This led them into conflict and later an alliance with other vigilantes and mercenaries such as [[Robert Farrell (Earth-616)|Rocket Racer]], [[Hobie Brown (Earth-616)|Prowler]], [[Thomas Fireheart (Earth-616)|Puma]] and [[Jackson Arvad (Earth-616)|Will O' The Wisp]].{{r|Web of Spider-Man #50}} Sable and the Wild Pack employed several of these men as an elite sub-team known as the Outlaws.{{r|Excalibur #36}}\n\nSilver Sable continued to work with the Wild Pack and lead them on missions around the world. She established her own, personal squad of skilled but reformed specialists, including an [[Amelia Chen (Earth-616)|assassin]], a [[Raul Quentino (Earth-616)|gang-banger]], a [[Carlton Stricklan (Earth-616)|Hydra masochist]], and [[Doug Powell (Earth-616)|a former KKK member]], as well as the hero [[Lemar Hoskins (Earth-616)|Battlestar]].{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #1|3}} This group performed several missions in the New York area, hunting [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom]] and the [[Human Torch]] when he was wanted by the authorities.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #374|375}}{{r|Fantastic Four #371|373}}\n\nThe team later recruited more superhuman members such as the [[Fin (Intruders) (Earth-616)|Fin]] and [[Malcolm Murphy (Earth-616)|Man-Eater]], who formed a new Wild Pack super-team, the Intruders. The Intruders team was led by Sandman and included Fin, Man-Eater, Paladin and [[Obax Majid (Earth-616)|Lightbright]]; they usually worked separately from the Wild Pack.{{r|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack #16|17}}\n\nSilver Sable eventually steps down as leader of the Pack, believing that she was pregnant but later found out to be a computer error. Silver Sable's father led the team in her absence as he had not died at the hand of his wife's killer but was rescued from them by Silver Sable and the Wild Pack. Silver Sable monitored the team from afar but felt compelled to rejoin the team as they were the only family she had.{{Citation}}\n\nThe team of operatives that worked with Silver Sable for many years have split and gone their separate ways. The team slowly declined in skill and ability without the A-list recruits, as after four unsuccessful missions and the betrayal, Silver Sable decided that the group had become too fractured to keep going. The teams were brought together one last time and she explained her plans to disband the team.{{r|Sable and Fortune #1}}\n\nYears later, Silver Sable reformed the Wild Pack to rebel against the new leader of Symkaria, [[Katarina Karkov (Earth-616)|Countess Karkov]], who had allied herself with the despicable Norman Osborn.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 27}}\n\n| Equipment               = Kevlar lined costumes, Specialist state of the art equipment such as capture net and hacking pad mostly created by Wild Pack member [[Raul Quentino (Earth-616)|Raul Quentino]].\n| Transportation          = Stealth Craft, Jet Packs and various other transportation.\n| Weapons                 = Massive supply of standard and state of the art weaponry.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n\n| Links                   = * http://www.marvel.com/universe/Wild_Pack\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Sable\n}}\n[[Category:Symkarian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Private Military Companies]]"
