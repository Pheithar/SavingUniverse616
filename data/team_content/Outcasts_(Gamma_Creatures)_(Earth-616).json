They lived in underground tunnels connected to [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]]'s [[Hulk's Cave|hidden desert lab]]. They befriended [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] when he was briefly transformed into a Hulk himself, but asked him to leave their company after the Army wounded or killed several of them while hunting him. \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mutates]]\n[[Category:Gamma Ray Exposure]]"
