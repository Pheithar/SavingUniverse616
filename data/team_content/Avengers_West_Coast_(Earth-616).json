He had detected a great threat to come, the [[Dire Wraiths]], and in order to better combat the threat, decided to establish a second active team of Avengers. He requested and received permission to do so from the U.S. government, which had begun to take a more active supervisory role towards the Avengers. Recently returned veteran member [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] was appointed as chairman of the West Coast roster.{{r|Avengers #243}} Selecting his team and [[Avengers Compound|a headquarters]], the bowslinger set to the task. The Vision would also go on to attempt the creation of a third Avengers team, but was turned down by potential Midwest Avengers Chairman [[Leonard Samson (Earth-616)|Doc Samson]].{{r|Avengers #252}}\n\nThe original lineup included team leader Hawkeye, his wife Bobbi a.k.a. [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Mockingbird]], the animalistic [[Greer Nelson (Earth-616)|Tigra]], industrialist-turned-superheroic actor [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] and the invincible [[James Rhodes (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]. Unbeknownst at first to the others, this Iron Man was not [[Iron Man (Anthony \"Tony\" Stark)|the original,]] but a substitute. Rhodey revealed he wasn't the original Iron Man shortly into his career with the group.{{r|West Coast Avengers #1|4}} Stark would, however, soon reclaim his Iron Man identity and join the group himself.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #1}} [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Dr. Hank Pym,]] a founding Avenger as Ant-Man (and subsequently Giant-Man, Goliath, and Yellowjacket) was offered the open sixth slot in the lineup, but he turned it down to act as their compound manager and resident scientist. Hawkeye and Mockingbird acted as the guiding force behind the West Coast team.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #1}}[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 794 Avengers Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|250px|]]\n\nThe West Coast roster was slightly more irreverent than their East Coast counterparts, taking upon themselves the nickname 'Wackos'. Their initial efforts to fill the sixth slot on the team involved courting the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] (by Hawkeye) and [[Bonita Juarez (Earth-616)|Firebird]] (by Mockingbird), but ultimately neither hero joined the Avengers West full time.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #4|10}}\n\nDuring one of their most fateful missions, the team became stranded in the past, its members separated in various historic eras. While most of the team was caught in ancient [[Egypt]], Mockingbird was held captive in the Wild West by the [[Lincoln Slade (Earth-616)|Phantom Rider]], who used amnesia-inducing drugs to convince her that she was his lover. Parallel to this adventure ran the salvation of Hank Pym, and his return to heroics. [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Moon Knight]] helped rescue the team, and he and Pym each accepted invitations to join the team.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #17|24}}\n\nThe adventure in time left repercussions for the team to deal with. Mockingbird and Hawkeye separated after he was told through Phantom Rider's spirit she had allowed him to fall to his death. Bobbi, along with Tigra and Moon Knight, left the group and with [[William Foster (Earth-616)|Bill Foster]] briefly had a team of their own. Tigra soon returned, and later Mockingbird, but the rift between the team's leading couple was far from healed.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #37|41}}\n\nWhen the United States government forcibly imposed a new field leader on the team, USAgent, Hawkeye quit in protest. No longer a couple, Hawkeye and Mockingbird still worked together to check out rumors of an unsanctioned team of [[Great Lakes Initiative (Earth-616)|Great Lakes Avengers]]. The GLA turned out to be an offbeat group of neophyte Midwestern heroes, whom the pair offered their mentorship to.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 2 #44|46}}\n\nThe Vision was reassembled, but his personality was largely a blank, emotionless slate. Wonder Man, who as the Vision's \"twin\" also harbored feelings for the Scarlet Witch, refused to serve as a template for his brother's thoughts again. The love triangle involving Simon, Wanda, and the Vision was salient throughout the tenure of the WCA. The original [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Human Torch (Jim Hammond)]] was also revived, leading to doubts as to what the Vision actually was. Meanwhile Hammond was asked to join the team, an offer he gratefully accepted, though he served only a brief amount of time before taking a leave of absence and relegating himself to reserve status.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #50|51}}\n\n[[Agatha Harkness (Earth-616)|Agatha Harkness]] visited her old student, the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], revealing that the Witch and the Vision's twins were not real, but magical constructs created from fragments of the demon [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]]'s soul.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #51|52}} The Scarlet Witch, already under strain from the Vision's dismemberment, her kidnapping by the forces of Set and That Which Endures, and the influence of Immortus, went insane. Her mental state was taken advantage of by her father, [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]], and she once again became a villain for a time.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #56}}\n\nThe other Maximoff twin, [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]] rescued his sister from Magneto's [[Asteroid M]] headquarters only to have her kidnapped by the time traveling [[Nathaniel Richards (Immortus) (Earth-6311)|Immortus]]. Immortus' entire plan was to use Wanda, as a \"nexus being\" capable of safeguarding the future of humanity, from the wrath of the [[Time-Keepers]]. With the help of Agatha Harkness, the Avengers were able to travel to [[Limbo (Temporal)|Limbo]] to rescue the Scarlet Witch. The Avengers fought Immortus' [[Legion of the Unliving (Kang) (Earth-616)|Legion of the Unliving]], doppelgangers created out of [[Space Phantoms]], and were successful in helping Wanda regain her sanity.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #61|62}} Quicksilver unofficially joined the team for a time before dropping down to reserve status, and ultimately leaving to join the new government-sanctioned [[X-Factor (Government) (Earth-616)|X-Factor]].{{r|Avengers: West Coast #69}}{{r|Avengers: West Coast #83}}\n\nTwo gigantic [[Terminus (Destroyer) (Earth-616)|Terminus]] creatures attacked the [[United States of America|United States]] were repulsed with the combined efforts of the East and West Coast teams as well as the Great Lakes Avengers. [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]] joined the team as a reservist. The team was reorganized in the wake of the Avengers obtaining a [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] charter, with [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|USAgent]] not making the final cut{{r|Avengers: West Coast #69}}\n\nThe team gained new members in the form of [[Julia Carpenter (Earth-616)|Spider-Woman (Julia Carpenter)]] and the [[Miguel Santos (Earth-616)|Living Lightning]]. USAgent also rejoined the ranks.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #74}} Mockingbird, still estranged from Hawkeye, nonetheless remained a reserve member. The team also got swept up in the events of \"[[Operation: Galactic Storm]]\", the aftermath of which created tensions in both teams when Iron Man, against orders, led a group of Avengers to execute the [[Kree]] [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]].<ref>[[Operation Galactic Storm]] crossover.</ref>\n\nFollowing the Avengers' return to Earth, the West Coast team encountered [[Ultron (Earth-616)|Ultron]] again, this time accompanied by his newest created mate, [[Alkhema (Earth-616)|Alkhema]], based on the brain waves of Mockingbird. During the confusion, Mockingbird was kidnapped and replaced by [[Barbara Morse (Skrull) (Earth-616)|a Skrull agent]] who was unfamiliar with the impending divorce of Hawkeye and Mockingbird. In the end Alkhema betrayed Ultron to the team, who were assisted by the Vision.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #89|92}}\n\nHawkeye reassumed his Goliath identity temporarily, during which time he and Mockingbird managed to reconcile due to the Skrull imposter's long-term plans. Iron Man and Wonder Man left the team, and allies War Machine (Jim Rhodes) and [[Chris Powell (Earth-616)|Darkhawk]] joined, the latter as a reservist. Some members of the team were also directly involved in the events of the [[Infinity Crusade]].{{r|Avengers: West Coast #95|97}}\n\nDuring the team's last major adventure, [[Satannish (Earth-616)|Satannish the Supreme]] and his [[Lethal Legion (Satannish) (Earth-616)|Legion]] captured Mockingbird and took her to his realm. To retrieve her, the West Coast Avengers followed and fought the combined forces of Mephisto and Satannish. Mockingbird was tragically killed by Mephisto, who as the Prince of Lies never revealed her Skrull heritage, while the team was trying to escape from his other-dimensional realm.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #98|100}}\n\nAfter events in [[Genosha]],<ref>The [[Bloodties]] crossover</ref> the East Coast team convened a meeting with the West Coast branch to discuss the future of the team. It was voted on and decided that due to an ever-changing membership, in-fighting among the members and attacks on the Compound it had proven too costly to maintain a separate branch of Avengers and the team was to be folded back into the East Coast branch. This decision came despite the even more fluid nature of the East Coast roster, and the fact that they had lost [[Avengers Mansion]] to the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]]. However, most active members of the West Coast team (Scarlet Witch, Iron Man, Spider-Woman, Wonder Man, and USAgent) were unhappy with this decision, and resigned from the Avengers entirely.{{r|Avengers: West Coast #102}} They went on to form a new team, [[Force Works (Earth-616)|Force Works]].{{r|Force Works #1}}\n\n===Reformed===\nThe West Coast Avengers were reformed years later by [[Katherine Bishop (Earth-616)|Kate Bishop]], an archer who shared her vigilante moniker with Clint Barton. While operating in [[Los Angeles]], Kate was encouraged by Barton to form and lead a team to help protect the West Coast. Kate's recruitment drive failed for the most part due to a lack of local superheroes, and the team ended up being formed by Clint (working part-time), her boyfriend [[Johnny Watts (Earth-616)|Fuse]], her friend [[America Chavez (Earth-616)|America]], and [[Gwendolyn Poole (Earth-TRN565)|Gwenpool]]. Desperate for funding, Kate also welcomed [[Quentin Quire (Earth-616)|Kid Omega]] into the ranks since he had signed a contract with a reality television crew, which would also sponsor the team.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 1}} The new West Coast Avengers first stopped [[M.O.D.O.K. Superior (Earth-616)|B.R.O.D.O.K.]] and an army of women turned into giant monsters (which included a brainwashed Tigra),{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 1|4}} and then [[Masters of Evil West Coast (Earth-616)|a group of villains]] led by [[Giuletta Nefaria (Earth-616)|Madame Masque]], with the help of Kate's ex [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Noh-Varr]].{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 5|7}} Fuse's sister [[Ramone Watts (Earth-616)|Alloy]] also joined the group when they confronted a group of vampires.{{r|West Coast Avengers Vol 3 8|10}}\n\nDuring the [[War of the Realms]], the West Coast Avengers - minus Kate, who had been drafted onto the [[Babysitters Club (Earth-616)|Babysitters Club]] - were battling [[Frost Giants]] in [[San Francisco]], when [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Superior Spider-Man]], who wanted to take advantage of America's powers, arrived and drove the Giants away with concentrated sun rays. Octavius suggested going to the beasts' origin, an idea the Avengers approved but could not perform at once since the Realm's magical properties prevented America from transporting them there. At Alloy's suggestion, they left for [[New York City]], helped the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] battle more giants, and through [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic's]] studies on the [[Bifrost]], Octavius artificially replicated the magic energy to enable America to open a portal to [[Jotunheim]]. The [[Jotunheim Strikeforce]] convinced the group to instead keep Earth safe instead of going to the war's core, with Otto only giving in after Gwen convinced him.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 2 7|8}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Avengers Identicard]]\n| Transportation          = [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjets]], [[Sky-Cycle|sky-cycles]]\n| Weapons                 = Each teammates' arsenal\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * In the early 90's, the title changed from ''West Coast Avengers'' to ''Avengers West Coast''.
