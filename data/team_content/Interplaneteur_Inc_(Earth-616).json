One of its activities is loaning money to starship owners who use their spacecraft as collateral. If they fall behind, the corporation will repossess the ship, by force if necessary and will even leave the owner adrift in space to die. They employ the humanoid [[Mandos]] as hired muscle. [[Adam Warlock (Earth-616)|Adam Warlock]] encountered a certified representative of the company ([[Marr Gar (Earth-616)|Marr Gar]]) who was having a starship forcibly repossessed by Mandos. He interceded and saved the life of the starship owner who left with his spacecraft, with an advise by the Warlock to get the necessary funds as soon as possible to pay what he owed.{{r|Warlock Vol 1 15}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:Interplanetary Organizations]]"
