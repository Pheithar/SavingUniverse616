The Hood's objective was to use the Illuminati to acquire power, and become part of the \"big leagues\" of super villains.{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 1}}\n\nFollowing a failed attempt at stealing [[Asgardian]] weapons,{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 #2|#5}} the Hood tried to amass an army with the villains that had been victims of abuse from S.H.I.E.L.D. when they were imprisoned at [[Pleasant Hill]]. When he proposed to target the families of their enemies, [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]] confronted Robbins, believing that to be a line that shouldn't be crossed. She forced the Hood to teleport them away from the base, and during an ensuing confrontation, she defeated him and destroyed his cloak, making him lose any of the powers it granted him.{{r|Illuminati Vol 1 7}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Parker Robbins (Earth-616)/Quotes]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
