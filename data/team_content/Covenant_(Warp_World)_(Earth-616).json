They scaled [[Wundagore Mountain|Mount Wundagore]] to approach the occult cult named the [[Evolutionaries (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Evolutionaries]]. Deeming the Covenant as a threat to their lifestlye, Wyndham dispatched [[Laura Kinney (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Weapon Hex]] and [[Hellhound (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Hellhound]] to intercept and neutralize the invaders. They were successful and killed the entirety of the Covenant.\n\nSix months later, when Weapon Hex rebelled against Wyndham, she used magic to summon the vengeful spirits of those who died as a result of his actions, including the Covenant. The spirits mauled Wyndham to death before vanishing.{{r|Infinity Wars: Weapon Hex Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Aside from [[Elsa Bladestone (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Elsa Bladestone]] being a warp between [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]] and [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]], the remaining members of the Covenant are not a mix between any two characters.
