They answered to the [[Carlos LaMuerto (Earth-616)|Black Tarantula]] , who they considered to be their master. The cult's chief assassin was given the title of Dragonfly. To take up the position of the Dragonfly, an assassin is given a target and per their  code of honor the assassin three attempts to kill the target. \n\nPer Black Tarantula's orders, the True Believers waged war against the [[Richard Fisk (Earth-616)|Rose]], disrupting his operations. The Hand arrived in New York, to stop their hated enemies, but were attacked by [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]] and left New York. Deciding that he couldn't beat the True Believers, the Rose hired them to help him resurrect Doctor Octopus. The ritual went sideways and though the Doctor was reborn, the True Believers who were present died.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 421|428}} \n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = *http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/truebelievers.htm\n}}\n[[Category:Korean Organizations]]\n[[Category:Earth Religions]]\n[[Category:Assassins]]\n[[Category:Martial Arts]]"
