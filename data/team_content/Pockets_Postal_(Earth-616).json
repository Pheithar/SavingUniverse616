The quartet escaped the palace, but Pockets still held a grudge against Rocket for imprisoning them and almost getting them killed, so Rocket responded by stealing Pockets' ship, leaving Pockets and Shrub stranded.{{r|Rocket Raccoon and Groot Vol 1 3}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Pockets' ship\n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
