To that end, under the leadership of [[Carlton Drake (Earth-616)|Carlton Drake]] they constructed a large fallout shelter to provide a place for their wealthy clients to live comfortably. In order to protect their future utopian society, they created five [[Symbiotes]] forcibly spawned from [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom]]: [[Agony (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Agony]], [[Phage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Phage]], [[Riot (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Riot]], [[Lasher (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Lasher]], and [[Scream (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Scream]].{{r|Venom: Lethal Protector #4|5}}\n\nAccording to [[Mendel Stromm (Earth-616)|Mendel Stromm]], the Life Foundation ended up succumbing to Chapter 7 bankruptcy.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 4}} However, as a result of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]]'s downfall at the hands of the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] and [[Xemnu (Earth-616)|Xemnu]],{{r|Immortal Hulk Vol 1 33}} and [[Alchemax (Earth-616)|Alchemax]] being attacked by [[Carnage's Hive (Earth-616)|Carnage's Hive]],{{r|Extreme Carnage: Phage Vol 1 1}}{{r|Extreme Carnage: Lasher Vol 1 1}} the Life Foundation was able to recoup their losses and emerge as the preeminent authority on symbiote-related matters in a world traumatized by [[Absolute Carnage|three]] [[King in Black (Event)|major]] [[Extreme Carnage|attacks]] by malevolent symbiotes in the space of a few months. The Life Foundation bankrolled an attempt to apprehend the Venom and [[Sleeper (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Sleeper]] symbiotes that ended with the assassination of Eddie Brock and the deaths of dozens of soldiers at the hands of Eddie's son [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan]], who'd bonded to the Venom symbiote.{{r|Venom Vol 5 1}} This attracted the attention of New York Senator [[Arthur Krane (Earth-616)|Arthur Krane]], who had been taken over by the [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage symbiote]] and killed his own father, Senator [[Peter Krane (Earth-616)|Peter Krane]]. While Senator Krane - secretly a sociopath who'd sworn fealty to [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]] - expressed dislike towards Carlton Drake, he offered to give the Life Foundation the authority to shape symbiote-related government policy, in exchange for their collaboration.{{r|Extreme Carnage Omega Vol 1 1}}{{r|Venom Vol 5 2}}\n \n| Equipment               =\n| Transportation          = Web-Slinging (Guardian Symbiotes).\n| Weapons                 = The Five Symbiotes; various anti-symbiote weapons\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:Symbiote-Enhanced Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
