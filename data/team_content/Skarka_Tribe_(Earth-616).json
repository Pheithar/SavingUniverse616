Although they were unable to conquer the city, it did sustain heavy damage; forcing the Atlanteans to abandon their city and move south to the [[Southern Ocean|frigid seas]]. Skarkan forces were also able to kill [[King Immanu]], but took heavy casualties doing so.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 1|; [[Atlantis]] entry}} {{r|Saga of the Sub-Mariner Vol 1 1}}\n\nAt some point following their banishment, the Skarka Tribe was enslaved by the bandit warlord [[Rorak (Earth-616)|Rorak]], who sought to exploit a prophecy that a member of the tribe would usurp leadership of the [[Atlantis (Kingdom)|Atlantean Empire]]; though the young [[Attuma (Earth-616)|Attuma]] led a rebellion and freed his people.{{r|Fear Itself: The Worthy #1}} Despite their freedom, the Skarka Tribe was often forced to resort to banditry when unable to hunt or forge for sufficient resources.{{r|King in Black: Namor Vol 1 2}} Driven into the chasms, the Skarka Tribe fell under the leadership of Attuma's father, [[Attukar (Earth-616)|Attukar]] and renamed themselves the \"Chasm People\".{{r|King in Black: Namor Vol 1 4}} \n\nIn the 1930s, the Chasm People entered negotiations to integrate into the Atlantean Empire,{{r|King in Black: Namor Vol 1 4}} but diplomatic talks were interrupted when the [[Swift Tide (Earth-616)|Swift Tide]] - an elite group of Atlantean warrior-women whose ranks included the Skarka Tribe's [[Garanna (Earth-616)|Garanna the Breaker]] - discovered the location of the [[Unforgotten Stone]], an eldritch artifact dating back to the time of [[R'lyeh (City)|R'lyeh]].{{r|{{cl|King in Black: Namor Vol 1 1}}-[[King in Black: Namor Vol 1 2|2]]}} Attukar and the representative of Atlantis - [[Krang (Earth-616)|General Krang]] - agreed to send Attuma and the Atlantean prince [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] to accompany the Swift Tide to recover the Unforgotten Stone, hoping to encourage a friendship between the two princes and thus further improve relations between their peoples.{{r|King in Black: Namor Vol 1 1}} However, the expedition ended in disaster, with the Swift Tide being corrupted into monsters by the Unforgotten Stone and going on a murderous rampage through the oceans.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 2}} King Attukar and the other members of the Skarka Tribe's delegation were slaughtered by the Black Tide, Attuma assuming leadership of his people and blaming Atlantis for the deaths.{{r|King in Black: Namor Vol 1 3}}\n\nUnder Attuma's increasingly ruthless leadership, the surviving members of the Skarka Tribe settled in an area of the ocean known as the Murky Depths and began waging war with the Atlantean Empire.{{r|Dark Reign: Made Men #1}} When the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] helped route Attuma's attempted conquest of the Atlantean Empire,{{r|Fantastic Four #33}} the Skarka Tribe began seeking to conquer both Atlantis and the surface world - bringing them into conflict with the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]],{{r|Avengers #154}} [[Defenders (Earth-616)|Defenders]],{{r|Defenders #7}} and other surface-world superhero teams as well.\n\nEventually, the Skarka Tribe conquered [[Lemuria (Pacific Ocean)|Lemuria]] as a stepping stone towards conquering Atlantis. However, they were thwarted by the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]].{{r|{{cl|Indestructible Hulk #4}}-[[Indestructible Hulk Vol 1 5|5]]}} When Attuma decided to finally set aside his grudge against Namor, the Skarka Tribe allied with [[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantis]].{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 4}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
