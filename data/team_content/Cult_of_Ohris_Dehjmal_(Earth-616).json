They also called themselves the \"sons of Lord Ohris Dejhmal\".{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #182|; The Man Who Would Be King}}<!-- paragraph maybe unnecessary, but lists all designations of his followers --> They were active in [[Valusia (Kingdom)|Valusia]],<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #121|; Pieces of Horror}} -->{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #165|; Siege}} and even had a sanctuary within the [[City of Wonders]].{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #121|; Pieces of Horror}}\n\n===Execution of Ohris Dehjmal===\nAt some point, Ohris Dehjmal was captured and sentenced to death, and half of [[Valusia (Kingdom)|Valusia]] came to the [[City of Wonders]] to witness his beheading. Before losing his head, Ohris threatened [[Kull (Earth-616)|Kull]], stating that that wouldn't stop him.<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #121|; Pieces of Horror}} -->\n\nTo prevent a possible return from Ohris, Kull had his body dismembered and scattered throughout the realm, while his head was kept in the [[Royal Palace (City of Wonders)|palace]] under guard.<!-- {{r|Savage Sword of Conan #121|; Pieces of Horror}} -->\n\nTwo days later, the [[Black Legion (Earth-616)|legionaries]] who guarded one of Ohris's arm at the [[Commoria]]-Valusia frontier were attacked by Ohris' disciples. All parts of him save his head were gathered before the next night, when they attacked the palace dungeon and stole the living talking head. The [[Spell of Containment|spell of containment]] which Ohris had used was wearing off, and so his disciples took him to their sanctuary, where the rest of the body had been gathered. Before they could reassemble him, Kull burst in with [[Brule (Earth-616)|Brule]] (who had found a trail to the sanctuary) and the [[Red Slayers (Earth-616)|Red Slayers]]. All disciples there were slaughtered{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #121|; Pieces of Horror}} and his cult subsequently scattered.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #132|; The Sea King}}\n\n''For a time, Dehjmal was worshiped by a party of [[fishmen]] having found his living head in the oceans.''{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #132|; The Sea King}}\n\n===Aftermaths of the execution===\nOhris Dehjmal's followers kept on trying to avenge him and destroy Kull. One night, they decided to infiltrate the palace and assassinate him. That same night, the [[Cult of Ral (Earth-616)|followers]] of the [[Ota Caristah (Earth-616)|Keeper of the Laws]], and worshipers of [[Kodatha  (Earth-616)|Kodatha]] (both having been killed by Kull) also decided to do so. Dehjmal's followers soon stumbled into those of the Keeper of the Laws, and after a bloody skirmish, united. The group was then attacked by the worshipers of Kodatha. Only one of those survived the brawl and, heading to Kull's bed, stumbled on a she and broke his head on a chest a few feet from Kull, unaware of the events of the night.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #135|; Fools' Night}}\n\nIt was seemingly considered for a time that his cult was no more,<!-- mentioned in a dream -->{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #140|; Nightmare}} but hordes of Ohris Dehjmal later attacked Kull in the Valusian countryside, wounding him with an arrow, and laying siege to his troop. Leading the Red Slayers, Brule prefered to hold the ground (and guard Kull, whose wound was infected) instead of following [[Bakas (Earth-616)|Bakas]]' advice to take the initiative. The next day, Ohris' hordes attacked the camp. As the Red Slayers were weakening against them, Kull emerged from his tent and, sparked by fever, bloodlustly slaughtered the assailants, rallying is troops in doing so.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #165|; Siege}}\n\nThe last of Dehjmal's followers later took camp in the outskirts of Valusia, where they encountered an [[Dendor (Earth-616)|impostor of Kull]], whom they slayed before being themselves slaughtered by the Red Slayers pursuing the impostor.{{r|Savage Sword of Conan #182|; The Man Who Would Be King}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
