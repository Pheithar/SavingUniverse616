On [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]]'s birthday, [[Zheng Zu (Earth-616)|Fu Manchu]] sent them to assassinate his son. The first two dispatched were defeated by Shang-Chi and rather than face Fu Manchu, they committed suicide by poison capsule. The next two assassins dispatched also failed, and both likewise committed suicide. \n\nAfterwards Shang-Chi infiltrated their NY base, encountered two Council members whom he knocked out. Wearing their robe, he entered the meeting room where he confronted his father and defeated the other 5 Council members.{{r|Giant-Size Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 1}} A little over half a year later during a briefing given by Fu Manchu regarding the Si-Fan civil war, Shang-Chi appeared and once again defeated the council.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 27}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Martial Arts weapons\n\n| Notes                   = It appears the Si-Fan always have a Council of Seven. Like the Persian Immortals, defeated or killed members are replaced so that the council has seven members. Though Shang-Chi defeated the council members dispatched to kill him and they committed suicide, when he infiltrated the NY City base the council still had 7 members. \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Assassins]]\n[[Category:Teams]]\n[[Category:Martial Arts]]"
