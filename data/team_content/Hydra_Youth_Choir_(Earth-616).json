With their mission at stake, Amadeus managed to keep his cover by calling out for help, though it cost Nadia hers. Amadeus eventually made it to the Choir, having also gained a reputation by allegedly having confronted the Champions.{{r|Secret Empire: Uprising Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Hydra Projects]]"
