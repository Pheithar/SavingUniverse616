Boston Dynamics' robots became popular in 2015 following a viral video in which a robot's stability was tested by being repeatedly kicked over. Like Brevoort Dynamics, Boston Dynamics is located in [[Massachusetts (State)|Massachusetts]].{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/02/12/googles-robotic-dog-that-cant-stop-getting-kicked-laps-up-internet-sympathy/|title=Google\u2019s robotic \u2018dog\u2019 \u2014 that can\u2019t stop getting kicked \u2014 laps up Internet sympathy|work=The Washington Post|first=Matt|last=McFarland|date=12 February 2015|accessdate=15 February 2020}}}}\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
