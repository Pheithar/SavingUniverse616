Following [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]'s [[King in Black (Event)|invasion of Earth]], several symbiotes remained on Earth and and the Guardsmen were sanctioned to take out any symbiotes or unauthorized aliens they found.{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}}\n\n[[Ozkar Waters (Earth-616)|Guardsman Waters]] pursued a human/[[Brood (Race)|Brood]] created by Alchemax who had escaped from custody and came into conflict with [[Toxin (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Toxin]] - who had bonded to Waters' teenaged son [[Bren Waters (Earth-616)|Bren Waters]] - in the process.{{r|King in Black: Planet of the Symbiotes Vol 1 3}} A few months after Knull's invasion, a squad of Guardsmen tracked down a symbiote that had bonded to a terminally-ill man to a coffee shop in [[Manhattan]], and attacked him when [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Flash Thompson]] happened to be in the locale. After the Guardsmen sniped the symbiote's host, Thompson turned into Agent Anti-Venom and confronted the agents under the assumption that he was their target. He stopped the Guardsmen from killing the symbiote and its host, and both fled.{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}}\n\n| Equipment               = '''[[Guardsman Armor]]'''\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
