They wore Captain America masks and performed vigilante justice against those opposed to their conservative values.  Captain America opposed and fought the BUCkies and their leader John Walker.{{r|Captain America #323}}\n\nThe BUCkies were all strength enhanced indiviudals. [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|Their leader, John Walker]] and [[Lemar Hoskins (Earth-616)|Lemar Hoskins]] were hand-picked by the government to be the \"New\" Captain America and Bucky.{{r|Captain America #327}} They later assumed the name [[USAgent]] and [[Battlestar]] respectively.{{r|Captain America #328}}  \n\n[[Hector Lennox (Earth-616)|Hector Lennox]] and [[Jerome Johnson (Earth-616)|Jerome Johnson]] were largely ignored by the new Captain America and Bucky. The two took revenge by assuming the costumed identity of \"Left-Winger\" and \"Right-Winger\" respectively. They first stole [[Guardsman Armor]] and battled Walker and Hoskins{{r|Captain America #334}} and later publicly revealed John Walker's identity during a press conference Walker was holding.{{r|Captain America #341}} As a result, the [[Watchdogs (Earth-616)|Watchdogs]] tracked down and murdered Walker's parents in Georgia. Outraged, Walker took revenge by badly beating Lennox and Walker. He then tied their bodies together and ignited them into an incendiary blaze.{{r|Captain America #347}} \n\nSome time later, Johnson and Lennox committed suicide.{{r|Captain America #381}}\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Vigilantes]]"
