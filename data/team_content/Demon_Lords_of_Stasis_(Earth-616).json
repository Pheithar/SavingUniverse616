All of them were powered beings, but their origins are unknown.\n\nTogether, they waged rebellion against the Lord of Stasis, and at last, the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] came to them, and they communed, although the Demon Lords fought to prevent that union from happening.\n\n[[File:Phoenix Messiah (Demon) (Earth-616) from Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 13 0004.png|thumb|left|330px|Burned by the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix]]]]\n===Evolution restarting===\nThe spell was broken by the Five and One and the Phoenix Force, and the Demons were swept away.\n\nThe whole history was witnessed by the alien peace-keeping robot [[Unit (Earth-616)|Unit]], who intended to witness a billion years later a variant of that story by observing [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], the [[Mutant Messiah]], without her own [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 2 13}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Magical whips\n\n| Notes                   = While the [[Phoenix Messiah (Demon) (Earth-616)|Phoenix Messiah]], the [[Lights (Demons) (Earth-616)|five acolytes]] and the \"great rite\" to stop Evolution are respectively counterparts to [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Hope Summers]], the [[Lights (Earth-616)|Lights]] and the [[M-Day]], the Demon Lords of Stasis were seemingly those of [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Wanda Maximoff]] who stopped the evolution by her \"no more mutants\" spell, and of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] who tried to prevent the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Phoenix Messiah]] from communing with the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Magicians]]\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Alien Demons]]"
