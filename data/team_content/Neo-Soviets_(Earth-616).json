The group then used the armors to attack [[Fort Knox]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], retrieve the body of Mutant serial killer [[Arkady Rossovich (Earth-616)|Omega Red]], and to capture Tony Stark himself. \n\nRealizing the true nature of the team and horrified at Rostov's treatment of the team's agents, such as sacrificing them to revive Omega Red, [[Laynia Petrovna (Earth-616)|Darkstar (Laynia Petrovna)]] betrayed him, freeing Tony Stark and holding off Omega Red as Stark fought Rostov. Rostov seemingly died when he self-destructed the [[Hulkbuster Armor]] he had been wearing for the fight. \n\n| Equipment               = \nStolen [[Iron Man Armor|Iron Man Armors]]:\n* [[Iron Man Armor Model 1]]{{r|Iron Man & the Armor Wars Vol 1 2}}\n* [[Iron Man Armor Model 2]]{{r|Iron Man & the Armor Wars Vol 1 2}}\n* [[Iron Man Armor Model 3]]{{r|Iron Man & the Armor Wars Vol 1 3}}\n* [[Iron Man Armor Model 7|Stealth Armor]]{{r|Iron Man & the Armor Wars Vol 1 2}}\n* [[Iron Man Armor Model 8|Silver Centurion Armor]]{{r|Iron Man & the Armor Wars Vol 1 3}}\n* [[Iron Man Armor Model 9]]{{r|Iron Man & the Armor Wars Vol 1 1}}\n* [[Peacekeeper Armor]]{{r|Iron Man & the Armor Wars Vol 1 1}}\n* [[Hulkbuster Armor]]{{r|Iron Man & the Armor Wars Vol 1 4}}\n* [[Iron Man Armor Model 11|War Machine Armor]]{{r|Iron Man & the Armor Wars Vol 1 2}}\n\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
