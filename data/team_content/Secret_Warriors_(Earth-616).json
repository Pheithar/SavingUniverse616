He was able to stay active in the shadows by providing support to the reformed [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Winter Soldier]], and allowing [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] to use one of his safe houses as a base for his [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] during the superhero [[Civil War]]. \n\nBut Fury had been up to more than that. After going into hiding, he was able to reignite his passions with his old flame, [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Earth-616)|Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine.]] Learning that Val was attempting to steal SHIELD passcodes from him and kill him, Fury shot and killed her. On her death, however, she revealed her true nature: she had been replaced by a [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrull]] impersonator. \n\nRecognizing that Earth was being invaded by alien sleeper agents hidden among the society, Fury have assembled a team of Secret Warriors to defend it. The Secret Warriors recruit were a varied lot. Fury chose them not only for their competence, but also for their relative anonymity: he knew that obscure heroes would be ones least likely to be targeted for replacement by the Skrulls. \n\nHe began with seismic-wielding former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Daisy Johnson (Quake)]]; [[Alexander Aaron (Earth-616)|Phobos (Alex)]] the 10-year old son of [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]]; [[Yo Yo Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Yo Yo Rodriguez]], the super-fast daughter of [[John Horton (Earth-616)|The Griffin]]; [[James Taylor James (Earth-616)|Hellfire (J.T. Slade)]], the mystical mercenary grandson of the [[Carter Slade (Earth-616)|Phantom Rider (Carter Slade)]]; the son of [[Anthony Druid (Earth-616)|Dr. Druid]], [[Sebastian Druid (Earth-616)|Sebastian Druid]]; and the muscle-bound [[Jerry Sledge (Earth-616)|Stonewall (Jerry Sledge)]]. \n\nIronically, Fury also attempted to recruit [[Layla Miller (Earth-616)|Layla Miller]], but she was expecting Agent Johnson. Miller claimed that if she joined Johnson's/Fury's team, \"it wouldn't work\" but without her, they wouldn't fail. She wished to stay with the mutants because they would need her. She stated Johnson would live through this, but was going to lose a lot.{{r|Mighty Avengers #13}}\n\n===Secret Invasion===\nBy the time the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]] became apparent to the rest of Earth's heroes, Fury and this \"new team of [[Howling Commandos (WWII) (Earth-616)|Howling Commandos]]\" were prepared.{{r|Mighty Avengers #18}} They arrived during the battle against the Skrulls in Times Square, aiding the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]] and the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] staff and cadets. The intervention of the Secret Warriors was crucial, helping to turn the tide of a losing battle against the Skrulls. [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers)]], after being heavily blasted by a group of Skrull soldiers ended up rising in the middle of Fury and his group in Times Square as they fought, shocked by the return of the ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. leader. \n\nAs they quickly headed into the fray, Yo-Yo managed to rescue all the downed Young Avengers and Initiative cadets just before could be executed. Ms. Marvel proceeded to help, but soon after was shot by Fury, who was unconvinced she was the real Carol Danvers. After being shot back into another street, the Skrull onlookers quickly overran her. Fury then called his men to retreat so that they could plan the next move. The Secret Warriors regrouped at Fury's command post with the Young Avengers and their Initiative comrades. \n\nThe Secret Warriors returned to the field for the final battle against the Skrulls alongside a slew of allies: the [[Mighty Avengers (Initiative) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]], the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], the [[Young Avengers (Earth-616)|Young Avengers]], the [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|new Captain America]], [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Noh-Varr]], the [[Hood's Gang (Earth-616)|Hood's crew]], and more. In the fighting, [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] killed [[Veranke (Earth-616)|Queen Veranke]] on national television. As the heroes destroyed the Skrull armada, the Secret Warriors realized that their objective was complete. \n\n===Secret Warriors===\nFury's Secret Warriors found a new purpose when Fury discovered that S.H.I.E.L.D. had been under HYDRA's control since its creation and that HYDRA's influence had reached even some of the highest levels of the United States government. They made the purpose of destroying both organizations.{{r|Secret Warriors #1|2}}\n\nLater on during the Siege of Asgard, The Warriors joined up with Steve Rogers, the New Avengers, and the Young Avengers to fight off Norman Osborn's attack on Asgard.{{r|Siege: Secret Warriors #1}}\n\n==Secret Warriors==\n* [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Colonel.
