In the modern day, Suma-Ket brougth the Four Sisters back by sacrificing the lives of [[Homo mermanus|Atlanteans]]. Their first mission was to kill [[Todd Arliss (Earth-616)|Tiger Shark]] and [[Seth (Atlantean) (Earth-616)|Seth]]. They almost got Tiger Shark and Seth, but [[Tamara Rahn (Earth-616)|Tamara Rahn]] and the [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]] rescued them, leading to one of the Four Sisters to be killed by Namor.{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner Vol 1 36}}\n\nThe remaining Four Sisters chased after [[Vashti Cleito-Son (Earth-616)|Vashti]] before he could warn [[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantis]] that the resurrected [[Artys-Gran (Earth-616)|\"Princess Fen\"]] was an imposter, but they were attacked by Namor and his allies. Tamara killed one of the Sisters while Tiger Shark and Namor captured the remaining ones. The Sisters were then taken by Namor to the [[Atlantis (Tha-Korr)|ancient Antarctic ruins of Atlantis]] and chained there. There, they were confronted by a male Nereid, the Sisters' brother, who guarded the real [[Fen (Earth-616)|Fen]]'s tomb who then killed them for bringing Namor there.{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner Vol 1 38|39}}\n\n==Powers==\nThe Four Sisters were amphibious in nature and survive in the ocean depths. They possessed super strength and had sharp claws they could use as weapons. They either could shapeshift or create illusions of a loved one of their victims to make them let their guards down, though it doesn't work on those who can tell that they are fake.{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner Vol 1 36}}{{r|Namor the Sub-Mariner Vol 1 38|39}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/unforgivendeadsumaket.htm#Nereids Nereid at Marvel Appendix]\n}}\n[[Category:Nereids]]"
