William Baker, a.k.a. Sandman]], after he was defeated by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]] during Doc Ock's plan to destroy the [[Earth]]. Sandman's \"soul sand grain\" was extracted and locked away in the [[Baxter Building]]. Otto managed to obtain this grain and put it in his secret lab.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #17}}\n\n[[File:Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616) from Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 7 001.jpg|left|50px]]\nThe second member was [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Maxwell Dillon, a.k.a. Electro]], who after being hurled into space by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], returned to Earth for revenge, however, Thor and Spider-Man were able to stop and defeat him. Electro was locked away in Otto's underwater lab.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #18}}\n\n[[File:Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616) from Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 7 001.jpg|left|50px]]\nThe third member was [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Dmitri Smerdyakov, a.k.a. Chameleon]], who after his involvement in Doc Ock's plan to destroy Earth, was taken into [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. Otto needed him for his team, so he broke him out of a [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]], and imprisoned him in his underwater lab instead.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #20|21}}\n\n[[File:Mysterion (Earth-616) from Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 7 001.jpg|left|50px]]\nThe fourth member was [[Mysterion (Earth-616)|Mysterion]], new in the world of supervillains. Otto caught Mysterion while robbing a bank, at first mistaking him for [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Quentin Beck]], the original [[Mysterio]], who betrayed him in his scheme to destroy Earth. But after seeing his face, he realized it wasn't him, yet Otto imprisoned Mysterion alongside the others.{{r|Avenging Spider-Man #22}}\n\n[[File:Adrian Toomes (Earth-616) from Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 7 001.jpg|left|50px]]\nThe fifth and last member was [[Adrian Toomes (Earth-616)|Adrian Toomes, a.k.a. The Vulture]]. After Otto's first encounter with Toomes as Spider-Man, Vulture sought revenge with other victims of Spider-Man's newfound brutality. But he was yet again defeated, and taken by Otto to be locked up amongst the other four villains in his secret underwater lab.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #1}}\n\n===Vs. Lightmaster===\n[[Edward Lansky (Earth-616)|Dr. Edward Lansky, a.k.a. the Lightmaster]], set his eyes on [[Allan Chemical (Earth-616)|Alchemax]], and their newest invention; a device which could work in sync with his own light-based powers. Lightmaster hired the [[Wrecking Crew (Earth-616)|Wrecking Crew]] to steal it, however, Spider-Man thwarted them with his new-found team; The Superior Six.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #5}} Spider-Man lost his mind control over the Superior Six members (due to [[Selah Burke (Earth-616)|Sun Girl]]'s wide-spread attack) during a battle against the [[Masters of Evil (Earth-616)|Masters of Evil]], and they attacked him for controlling them.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 6}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Superior Spider-Man's Suit]], [[Spider-Man's Web-Shooters]], [[Vulture's Wings]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The Superior Six appear to be Octavius' heroic answer to the [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Six]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n\n[[ru:\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0451\u0440\u043a\u0430 (616)]]"
