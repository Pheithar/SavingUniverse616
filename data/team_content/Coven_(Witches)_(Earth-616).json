The witches fed on the souls of these old gods and dispersed their power back into the cosmos.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 8}}\n\n| HistoryText             = Already expecting [[Ebony Maw (Earth-616)|Ebony Maw]] would try to use [[Thane (Earth-616)|Thane]] to take the [[Black Quadrant]] for his own, [[Corvus Glaive (Earth-616)|Corvus Glaive]] prepared for their arrival by enlisting the Coven's help against them. When they finally struck, the Coven depowered Thane while Corvus captured Maw. Both were emprisoned by Corvus soon afterwards, but each one escaped at different points in time.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 4}}\n\nMonths later, Thane took control of the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] on behalf of [[Death (Earth-616)|Lady Death]], prompting [[Eros (Earth-616)|Starfox]], [[Nebula (Earth-616)|Nebula]], and the [[Tryco Slatterus (Earth-616)|Champion of the Universe]] to seek [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] in an effort to stop him. Thanos led them into meeting the Coven so he could claim the God Quarry's power to fight Thane. Starfox tried to use his powers to manipulate the witches into helping them, but it didn't work and the witches punished him for his insolence. The witches then challenged Thanos into entering the God Quarry to face a trial. If he succeeded in passing it, he would be granted access to the power held by the Quarry; otherwise, he would join the other deities frozen for eternity in its walls.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 8|9}}\n\nAfter Thanos overcame the God Quarry, the Coven teleported him to Thane's presence and the two fought; both eventually falling in the God Quarry.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 10|11}} Sensing the Phoenix Force within Thane, the Coven used their power to release it back into the cosmos, thus depowering Thane once again. As soon as Thanos dropped Thane into the God Quarry to live forever trapped within its walls, Lady Death herself appeared in the God Quarry to talk with Thanos, revealing that was all a part of her plan to make him worthy of her love again. However, Thanos did not want anything to do with Death anymore, so the three witches banished her from their realm.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 12}}\n\nOnce Thanos left, the Coven bore witness as Nebula entered the God Quarry to claim its power. They were surprised to see her returned and imbued with the Quarry's power, but couldn't teleport her to kill Thanos as she asked, because Thanos had already been killed by [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]]. The witches informed Nebula that Gamora, who was calling herself [[Requiem]] at the time, had created [[Infinity Sword|a powerful weapon]] to do so, and offered to point her towards a weapon of her own if she wished. She accepted and went on a quest to get said weapon: the [[Naglfar Beacon]].{{r|Asgardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 3}}\n\nFeeling the arrival of [[Infinity Wars|Infinity's End]], the Coven self-immolated while the newcomers [[Loki Laufeyson (Ikol) (Earth-616)|Loki]] and [[Flowa (Earth-616)|Flowa]] watched.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 1}}\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\n===Powers===\nThe Witches possessed powers seemingly rivaling that of the strongest cosmic beings in the universe. They were able to separate the Phoenix Force from Thane and remove the cosmic entity Death from their realm with ease.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 12}} They also possessed apparent chronokinetic power, as they rapidly aged Starfox when he tried to manipulate them.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 9}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The Coven is said to be older than any gods.{{r|Thanos Vol 2 8}}\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Chronokinesis]]\n[[Category:Psychic Vampires]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]"
