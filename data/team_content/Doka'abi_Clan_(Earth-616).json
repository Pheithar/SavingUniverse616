Once several tribes were united under the [[Warlord (Sakaar) (Earth-616)|Warlord]]'s rule, the Doka'abi Clan was chased into the desert.\n\nWhen the Warlord's forces demanded the Doka'abi Clan to run the gauntlet, a challenge for survival, Bahng's clan attempted to contact the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] for help so he could represent his clan as their champion. Their call for help was heeded by [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus Cho]], the successor of the late Bruce Banner.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 709}}\n\nFollowing his victory over the Gauntlet and the fall of the Warlord, the Hulk and his ally [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Odinson]] helped the Doka'abi build a fortified village so they could begin rebuilding civilization.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 1 713}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
