The only survivor, a young girl named [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]] was found by [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] who raised her as an assassin.{{r|Gamora Vol 1 1}}\n\nWhen the entire Badoon Royal Line had gathered on [[Moord (Planet)|Moord]] to welcome the ascension of a new Brother Royale, Thanos brought Gamora there as a gift, to allow her to fulfill her revenge. Meanwhile, on his deathbed the previous Monarch confessed that he had an illegitimate daughter [[L'Wit (Earth-616)|L'Wit]] who was send to [[Ubliex]], a planet where nobody could escape as it was falling into a black hole. Gamora killed the new Monarch and everyone else of Royal blood who was on Moord, throwing the stability of the Empire into jeopardy. The Ruling Council agreed that in a situation like this, a female Regent of Royal descent would be acceptable and hired a bounty hunter [[Klaxon (Earth-616)|Klaxon]] to retrieve L'Wit from Ubliex.{{r|Gamora Vol 1 1}}\n\nAfter Klaxon confirmed that he had acquired the target, the Ruling Council revealed that his payment was the way off the dying planet: the [[Elemental]], an item of great power that could only be used once was the only way to have a starship escape the black hole's gravity. The Elemental was dropped off on Ubliex by a drone,{{r|Gamora Vol 1 3}} but although L'Wit eventually left the planet, she had no desire to become part of Badoon Royal Family and escaped to forge her own destiny.{{r|Gamora Vol 1 5}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Interplanetary Organizations]]\n[[Category:Slavers]]\n[[Category:Empires and Civilizations]]"
