Their criminal activities included illegal transactions, drugs, brothels, and video piracy. They also had dealings with the [[Jade Dragon Triad (Earth-616)|Jade Dragon Triad]].<!-- {{r|2020 iWolverine Vol 1 1}} -->\n\nTwo members of the organization, the [[Karamazov Brothers (Earth-616)|Karamazov Brothers]], bought the legs and body of the android [[Elsie-Dee (Earth-616)|Elsie-Dee]] from [[Donald Pierce (Earth-616)|Donald Pierce]] for cheap. They then put a Japanese schoolgirl uniform on the robotic body and planned to have it serve drinks to customers at [[Club Azimut]], an establishment ran by their organization.<!-- {{r|2020 iWolverine Vol 1 1}} -->\n\nElsie-Dee and her partner [[Albert (Earth-616)|Albert]] later appeared at Club Azimut to retrieve Elsie-Dee's body. Albert took out the gang members at the club, including the Karamazov Brothers, and put Elsie-Dee back together. The Vladivostok Mafia later organized to get revenge on Albert and Elsie-Dee.{{r|2020 iWolverine Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe confrontation with the androids went badly for the gang as Albert and Elsie-Dee were able to escape while killing many of their members, including the Karamazov Brothers.{{r|2020 iWolverine Vol 1 2}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Motorcycles, cars\n| Weapons                 = Guns, rocket launcher\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n\n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Russian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Molina]]"
