They gathered [[James Bradley (Earth-616)|Dr. Nemesis (James Bradley)]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men #504}} [[Madison Jeffries (Earth-616)|Box (Madison Jeffries)]],{{r|Uncanny X-Men #505}} and [[Yuriko Takiguchi (Earth-616)|Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men #506}} After having defeated the [[Godzilla (Earth-616)|Leviathan]] Takiguchi had activated believing the newcomers to be Russians, the pack returned to [[Graymalkin Industries]] to meet their final member, [[Kavita Rao (Earth-616)|Dr. Kavita Rao]], who was formerly trying to cure mutation.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #507}}\n\nTogether, they tried to figure what can turn the [[X-Gene]] back on in the depowered mutants. Nemesis brought up pre-mutant DNA from his parents as an example.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #512}}\n\nThey also assembled a time travel device to help them locate [[Nathan Summers (Earth-616)|Cable]] and the [[Hope Summers (Earth-616)|Mutant Messiah]] in the far future. However, the devices were only prototypes, brought together in a short time. The side effects included biological acceleration so therefore the travelers would have to return to the present in thirty three and a half hours.{{r|X-Force Vol 3 12}}\n\n===Utopia===\nThe X-Club went down two members, as Dr. Takiguchi died on Utopia of natural causes,{{r|Uncanny X-Men #515}} and Beast left the X-Men, grown disillusioned with how Cyclops was leading what remained of the mutant race.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #519}}\n\n===Reformation===\nEventually, the X-Club reassembled, composed then of Kavita Rao and Madison Jeffries. They provided [[James Howlett (Earth-21923)|Logan]] with a cell to lock down [[Aliana Alba (Earth-616)|Dr. Alba]].{{r|Weapon X Vol 3 11}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Ghost boxes|Ghost Box]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Think Tanks]]"
