They eventually fell in the hands of these individuals: Warlock (the Soul Stone), [[Turk Barrett (Earth-616)|Turk Barrett]] (the Mind Stone), [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] (the Space Stone), [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]] (the Power Stone), [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] (the Reality Stone) and [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]] (the Time Stone). After [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] stole the Time Stone from the Super-Skrull, he contacted the other wielders of the Infinity Stones and requested parley to reassemble the Infinity Watch for the sake of the gem's protection.{{r|Infinity Countdown Vol 1 5}}\n\nThe Infinity Watch convened in [[Central Park]] on [[Earth]]. Their meeting was interrupted by the arrival of Gamora, who set out to collect the Infinity Stones as part of a plan to reunite with a fragment of herself that was trapped within the Soul Gem.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 1}} In the middle of the ensuing fight, Doctor Strange convinced Turk Barrett to hand over the Mind Stone and walk away. After taking the Reality Stone from Captain Marvel, Gamora progessively got hold of the rest, murdering Warlock in the process.{{r|Infinity Wars Vol 1 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[it:Guardiani dell'Infinito (Terra-616)]]\n[[Category:Cosmic Teams]]"
