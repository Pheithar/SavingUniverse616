One of their test subjects was [[Slate (Mercury Rising) (Earth-616)|Slate]].{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #11}} Slate believed the program to have been closed down, with everybody associated with it being supposedly dead. Due to its secrecy, only a handful of people knew of its existence, including [[Cassandra Mercury (Earth-616)|Cassandra Mercury]]{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #13}} and [[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Prodigy]].{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #11}} In reality, Diogenes was still very much active. One of their operations involved liberating a [[Demons|demon]] from [[Hell]] which went on to assume the identity of [[Black Marvel (Demon) (Earth-616)|Black Marvel]].{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #13}} They also recruited the souls of the recently departed whom they determined had yet to do some good in the world.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #22}}\n\nFollowing [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]]'s short-lived [[Secret Empire (Event)|empire]] during which they bombed [[Las Vegas]], the Diogenes Initiative had plans to rebuild the city and remake it in their own image. Around this time, Las Vegas local vigilante the [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider (Ben Reilly)]] clashed with Black Marvel, who was reforming the [[Slingers (Earth-616)|Slingers]], and killed him.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #13}} It would be later mentioned that the Black Marvel had been going far outside the parameters of his assignment, so his disposal was actually considered well-timed.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #15}}\n\nThanks to the presence of a seer in their ranks, the Diogenes Initiative learned that an attempt by [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] at restoring Las Vegas was going to unleash a demonic invasion led by [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]]. Diogenes member [[Jezebel (Diogenes Initiative) (Earth-616)|Jezebel]] facilitated the capture of the Scarlet Spider's acquaintance [[June (Las Vegas) (Earth-616)|June]] to use her as leverage and force him to join the fight against Mephisto's forces once the invasion had started.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #13}}\n\nWhen a [[Mindless Ones|Mindless One]] was set loose on Las Vegas and the other [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider (Kaine Parker)]] confronted it, [[Nakano (Earth-616)|Nakano]] of the Diogenes Initiative took it down. Other agents prepared it for transport, and it was taken to their secret headquarters hidden beneath a suburban house at [[61 Silver Street]] in [[Henderson (Nevada)|Henderson]]. Feeling suspicious of Nakano, Kaine followed them.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #21}} In the meantime, Ben had gone to [[Sheldon Sanders (Earth-616)|Dr. Sheldon Sanders]] for help to cure [[Abigail Mercury (Earth-616)|Abigail Mercury]] of a terminal genetic disease.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #20}} After being fatally injured by [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron]], Dr. Sanders revealed to Ben that he belonged to the Diogenes Initiative. Before passing away, he gave Ben the address of their headquarters, promising him that his boss could cure Abigail.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #21}}\n\nKaine infiltrated the facility and reached a seemingly-infinite ethereal bureau where people from different time periods were carrying out administrative procedures. He was then taken down by Nakano. When Ben arrived to 61 Silver Street and knocked on the door of the house, he was greeted by Jezebel. Gabriel appeared when Ben demanded to see Sanders' boss. He revealed to Ben that he was an Angel, and even showed him a glimpse of his true form for a few seconds. After giving Ben a sample of is blood which would cure Abigail, Gabriel reunited him with Kaine and teleported both outside.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #22}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * [[Richard Gilmore (Earth-616)|Prodigy]] was able to recognize that [[Slate (Mercury Rising) (Earth-616)|Slate]] was a product of Diogenes Initiative simply by observing that he was white-skinned and bulletproof.{{r|Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #11}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Super-Soldier Programs]]"
