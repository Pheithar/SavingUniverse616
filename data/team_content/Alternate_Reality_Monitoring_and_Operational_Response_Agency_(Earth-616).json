A.R.M.O.R.'s central command is known as [[The Hollow (Earth-616)|the Hollow]] and is a bunker miles underground that is accessible only by teleportation. [[Charles Little Sky (Earth-616)|Charles Little Sky]] serves as the agency's director and was chosen in part because of his ability to create interdimensional portals.\n\nThe agency monitors areas on Earth where perpendicular and wave universes naturally intersect with the 616 Earth. The largest cluster of intersecting universes is known to be in [[Citrusville (Earth-616)|Citrusville]], Florida.\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nWhile responding to a call for help, [[Command (Earth-616)|the Command]], Florida's [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] team, was ambushed by locals who had been infected with a zombie plague brought by another reality's Deadpool. The Command's leader [[John Kelly (Earth-616)|Siege]] -- apparently an agent of A.R.M.O.R. -- quickly became infected despite being cybernetic. Protocols programmed into his cybernetic systems by A.R.M.O.R. terminated him and alerted the agency to the crisis.\n\n[[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]], who had been recruited by A.R.M.O.R. as an expert on biological threats, formulated a vaccine that would inoculate against the extra-dimensional zombie plaque. However, he would need a blood sample from a living person on the source Earth to create it. Director Little Sky deputized [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]] and [[Aaron Stack (Impostor) (Earth-616)|Machine Man]] for the mission, since they could not be infected. What Director Little Sky did not realize was that A.R.M.O.R. had been infiltrated, and Morbius was actually his zombie counterpart. Rather than a vaccine, this [[Michael Morbius (Earth-2149)|Morbius]] intended to infect the entire Fifty State Initiative.\n\nWhile Jocasta and Machine Man were on the other Earth, the Hollow was overrun by a zombie outbreak as the alternate Morbius made his move. Director Little Sky ordered Jocasta to secure the teleportation bays to keep the outbreak from spreading to the surface. None of the infected A.R.M.O.R. personnel could be allowed to escape. The real Morbius was freed and staked his zombie counterpart while Machine Man's arrival helped contain the rest. The situation was brought under control.\n\nHowever, it was discovered that someone had made it out of the Hollow before Jocasta secured the teleportation bay. Morbius asked Director Little Sky to be allowed to lead the unit to pursue the remaining zombies. That unit would be called the [[Midnight Sons (Earth-616)|Midnight Sons]].{{r|Marvel Zombies 3 Vol 1 1|4}}\n\n===Operation: Midnight Sons===\nMorbius was dispatched with [[Jennifer Kale (Earth-616)|Jennifer Kale]], [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstorm]] and [[Jack Russell (Earth-616)|Werewolf by Night]] to contain the zombie outbreak. The breach of Hollow security was perpetrated by the zombie [[Simon Garth (Earth-616)|Simon Garth]], who was brought in to test for answers against the alternate reality zombie plague, and the head of the alternate reality [[Wade Wilson (Earth-2149)|Deadpool]], who carried the plague.\n\nThe situation escalated when the plague came into the possession of [[Black Talon]], who intended to sell it to [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|the Hood]]. The Midnight Sons clashed with the Hood's thugs of choice, the [[Night Shift]]. Making matters even worse, Morbius' vaccine failed. The plague mutated, becoming an incredibly deadly airborne entity.\n\nA.R.M.O.R. was prepared to unleash a nuclear strike to sterilize the whole region, but the Midnight Sons were able to combine Kale's Atlantean sorcery and Black Talon's voodoo to bottle up the airborne plague into the body of Simon Garth, who was then taken into A.R.M.O.R. custody.\n\nDirector Little Sky informed Morbius that he would like to keep the Midnight Sons on call. The zombie plague was not the first monster from another reality to try to get loose on their Earth, and it was unlikely to be the last.\n\n===Lyra the Savage She-Hulk===\nA.R.M.O.R. tracked an incursion from [[Earth-8009]] into [[New York]], which turned out to be [[Lyra (Earth-8009)|Lyra]], the daughter of [[Thundra (Earth-8009)|Thundra]] and [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] from an alternate future reality. Intercept teams were dispatched, but she tore through them upon her arrival. She was monitored going to the ruins of [[Avengers Mansion|Avengers Mansion]], where she abducted A.R.M.O.R. agent [[Alexander Erde (Earth-616)|Alexander Erde]] to use as a field guide for this reality.\n\n[[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] was sent in to try to reign in Lyra under A.R.M.O.R.'s authority, and she nearly succeeded after Lyra was discovered to get weaker the angrier she becomes. However, [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] interfered and pitched She-Hulk from the fight, allowing the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]] to take over. They were able to capture Lyra, and [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] hoped this incident would allow him to fold A.R.M.O.R. into the control of [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]]\n\nWith the help of She-Hulk, Director Little Sky was able to have both of the gamma women teleported directly out of [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] to the Hollow. He now realized that Lyra was not here as part of an attack and therefore not the threat he assumed her to be. However, she would still have to be deported back to her home reality. She preferred not to go back though and possessed downloaded information on Osborn's covert dealings to negotiate a deal.\n\nThis deal allowed Lyra to remain on [[Earth-616]], as an agent of A.R.M.O.R.\n\n===Other Zombie Dimenisons===\nA.R.M.O.R. became aware of a planestorm in the multiverse, where several realities clashed and tethered together to allow for easy crossovers between them. What was unique about this planestorm was the many of the realities involved were experiencing their own zombie plagues. Seeking to further understand and cure the zombie plague, Morbius sent newly recruited A.R.M.O.R. agent [[Howard the Duck (Earth-616)|Howard the Duck]] and Machine Man on an unauthorized mission into the planestorm to collect samples of as many unique zombie types as possible.\n\nOn an Earth where the wild west was still the present day, the two agents deputized [[Jacali Kane (Earth-483)|Swift Cloud]], the daughter of [[Harold Kane (Earth-483)|Hurricane]], to help them in their mission. She had little reason to stay on her own Earth considering she just witnessed zombies eating her father.{{r|Marvel Zombies 5 Vol 1 1|5}}\n\n===Nazi Zombies===\nSome time later, A.R.M.O.R. was contacted by [[Zephyr Zog (Earth-12591)|Zephyr Zog]], a scientist on [[Earth-12591]], who gave them footage showing a world where Nazis had taken over by unleashing a zombie plague upon the planet. The Nazis were unsatisfied with conquering their own world, however, and soon turned their attention towards invading Earth-616 by creating a cross-dimensional battleship powered by a reality-shattering super-engine.\n\nTo combat this new threat, A.R.M.O.R. asked Howard the Duck to assemble a unit of battle-hardened operatives to go to this world and stop the zombies' invasion scheme. Howard gathered together an eclectic group of superhuman operatives including [[Lemar Hoskins (Earth-616)|Battlestar]] and a skeptical [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Dum-Dum Dugan]], which he dubbed the [[Ducky Dozen (Earth-616)|Ducky Dozen]]. The unit was transported to the zombies' Earth through the trans-dimensional teleportation powers of group member [[Taxi Taylor (Earth-616)|Taxi Taylor]] and were attacked by large cannons firing zombies at them immediately upon arrival. Team member [[Gur (Earth-616)|Gur]] was quickly killed and the group's ship was destroyed in the initial battle, leaving the remaining members stranded on the ground.{{r|Marvel Zombies Destroy! Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe Dozen suffered their next casualties when they were attacked by a zombified version of the [[Invaders (Earth-12591)|Invaders]]. [[Kurt Barton (Earth-4040)|Breeze Barton]], [[Lagaro (Earth-616)|Dynaman]] and the [[Red Raven (Ducky Dozen) (Earth-616)|Red Raven]] were all killed by the superpowered zombies before the group was rescued by the [[Suffragists (Earth-12591)|Suffragists]], the last resistance to the zombified Third Reich left on the planet. The Suffragists took the surviving members of the Ducky Dozen to meet Professor Zog, who revealed that he himself was a Nazi, but that he didn't agree with the Reich's plan to Zombify the Multiverse. Zog arranged transport for the group aboard his personal train in order to get them inside the Zombies' headquarters, where they keep the trans-dimensional battleship.{{r|Marvel Zombies Destroy! Vol 1 2}} Soon Zog himself, as well as the Suffragist [[Columbia (Earth-12591)|Columbia]] were killed by zombie Valkyries that attacked the train looking for [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-12591)|Loki]].\n\nAfter the Valkyries themselves were driven off, Loki appeared to the remaining adventurers.{{r|Marvel Zombies Destroy! Vol 1 3}} He reveals that he is behind the planet's zombie apocalypse, but that he didn't intend for the Asgardians to also become infected with the plague. With Loki's help, the group managed to avoid the Asgardian zombies who were looking for Loki. Dum Dum is then disguised as his zombie [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-12591)|self]] and snuck into the zombies' secret headquarters. The rest of the group end up fighting the Asgardian zombies while the [[William Carmody (Earth-616)|Eternal Brain]] used his telekinetic powers to pick the secret entrance's lock. [[Dragoon (Earth-616)|Dragoon]] was killed by a zombie [[Skurge (Earth-12591)|Executioner]] before the group was able to seal themselves inside the hideout.{{r|Marvel Zombies Destroy! Vol 1 4}}\n\nThe group suffered more casualties once inside the base, however, as [[Flexo (Earth-616)|Flexo]], the [[Mark Todd (Earth-616)|Blazing Skull]] and [[Libertas (Earth-12591)|Libertas]] were all torn limb from limb by a zombified [[Toothgnasher (Earth-12591)|Toothgnasher]] and [[Toothgrinder (Earth-12591)|Toothgrinder]] while the others escaped. The rest, including Loki, headed to a secret bunker containing countless powerful weapons that the zombies had horded during their world takeover. They succeeded in launching an atomic bomb that wiped out the zombie threat, though it cost [[Madeline Joyce (Earth-12591)|Miss America]] her life. The remaining Dozen and the [[Rosalind (Earth-12591)|Riveter]] were able to escape thanks to the selfless sacrifice of the Eternal Brain, who gave Taxi Taylor the time she needed to transport them back to the Hollow at the cost of his own life. Unbeknownst to the group, they also brought a zombified [[Steven Rogers (Earth-12591)|Captain America]] back to Earth-616.{{r|Marvel Zombies Destroy!
