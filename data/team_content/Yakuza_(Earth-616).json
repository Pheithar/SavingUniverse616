It's members used to wear pin-striped suits and fedora hats like those in the old Cagney movies. Recently Yakuza were dressing up as if they were starring in the Best Rap videos for the MTV awards. Yakuza working in the United States, had lost their respect for traditions and leadership. They had neither focus nor any obvious hierarchy.{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 57}} \n\nAmong the Yakuza, at least one clan was able to establish its supremacy over the other Yakuza syndicates, [[Clan Yashida (Earth-616)|Clan Yashida]]. Under [[Shingen Harada (Earth-616)|Lord Shingen]], the Yashida ruled Japan's underworld.{{r|Wolverine Vol 1 1|4}} Clan Yashida also controlled one of the world's most powerful corporations, the Yashida Corporation.{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 8}} Technologically, the Yashida were a pretty conservative organization. The most technologically advanced Yakuza clan were the [[Shogun Reapers (Earth-616)|Shogun Reapers]]. Known as the Science Clan they were equipped with battle suits and humanoid mecha, operated spacecraft and moon rover vehicles, and built a base on the moon. It was also the most ambitious and dangerous, as they threatened the Earth with a frequency cannon unless the nations of the world submitted.{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} One Yakuza syndicate, the [[Aizukotetsu-kai (Earth-616)|Aizukotetsu-kai]] possessed cloning technology.{{r|Deadpool Team-Up Vol 1 1}} A rival of the Yashida, [[Clan Tatsu (Earth-616)|Clan Tatsu]] possessed cybernetic technology, which they used to create the [[Cyburai (Earth-616)|Cyburai]]{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 63|64}} At least two Yakuza clans, had their own ninjas, the [[Clan Yashida (Earth-616)|Yashida]] and the [[Yamaguchi-gumi (Earth-616)|Yamaguchi-gumi]].{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 63|64}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 158}}\n\nVarious customed superheroes, vigilantes, and superhero teams had confrontations with the Yakuza, especially the mutant [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 1 1|4}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 55|57}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 300|303}} Others of note who the Yakuza had confrontations with were the vigilantes [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] and [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]], the agents of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]], the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]], and [[X-Factor (Earth-616)|X-Factor]].{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 55|57}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 289|290}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 63|64}}{{r|Daredevil Vol 2 56|60}}{{r|Punisher Vol 3 3}}{{r|Punisher Vol 3 9|10}}{{r|New Warriors Vol 1 20}}{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 47}}{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 2 72}} The clans of the Yakuza were also at times at war with the ninja death cult in its home country, the [[Hand (Earth-616)|Hand]], and some Yakuza clans were at times allied with the ninjas of the Hand.{{r|Wolverine Vol 1 1|4}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 55|57}}{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 300|303}} One clan, the Yashida had been at war with the Hand for centuries, since the 1600s.{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 33|34}} The Yashida also had dealings with the terrorist organization Hydra.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 11|13}}\n\n===Yakuza Groups===\n* [[Clan Yashida (Earth-616)|Clan Yashida]]\n* [[Dai Kumo's Clan (Earth-616)|Clan Dai-Kumo]] (defunct)\n* [[Four Winds (Deadpool Foes) (Earth-616)|Four Winds]]\n* [[Double Jade Clan (Earth-616)|Double Jade Clan]]\n* [[Yamaguchi-Kai Clan (Earth-616)|Yamaguchi-Kai Clan]]\n* [[Dragon Clan (Earth-616)|Dragon Clan]]\n* [[Kokusui-Gumi (Earth-616)|Kokusui-Gumi]]\n* [[Daichi Doku (Earth-616)|Clan Daichi Doku]] (defunct)\n* [[Clan Tatsu (Earth-616)|Clan Tatsu]]\n* [[Red Dragon Clan (Earth-616)|Red Dragon Clan]]\n* [[Yamaguchi-gumi (Earth-616)|Yamaguchi-gumi]]\n* [[Shogun Reapers (Earth-616)|Shogun Reapers]]\n* [[Tosei-kai (Earth-616)|Tosei-kai]]\n* [[Clan Orii (Earth-616)|Clan Orii]]\n* [[Aizukotetsu-kai (Earth-616)|Aizukotetsu-kai]]\n* [[Ichiwa-kai (Earth-616)|Ichiwa-kai]]\n* [[Sumiyoshi-kai (Earth-616)|Sumiyoshi-kai]]\n* [[Inagawa-kai (Earth-616)|Inagawa-kai]]\n* [[Kanto-kai (Earth-616)|Kanto-kai]]\n\n===Crimelords===\n* [[Shingen Harada II (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]] (new) (armor user)\n* [[Shirohana (Earth-616)|Pale Flower]] (mutant) (female)\n* [[Keniuchio Harada (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai]] (original) (mutant)\n* [[Mariko Yashida (Earth-616)|Mariko Yashida]] (female)\n* [[Ieyasu Imura (Earth-616)|Ieyasu Imura]]\n* [[Daniel Kiku (Earth-616)|Danny Fear]]\n* [[Higashi (Earth-616)|Higashi]]\n* [[Lord Shiro (Earth-616)|Lord Shiro]]\n* [[Kenzo Orii (Earth-616)|Kenzo Orii]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Lord Kenada (Earth-616)|Lord Kenada]]\n* [[Shinji Kizaki (Earth-616)|Shinji Kizaki]]\n* [[Tatsu'o (Earth-616)|Tatsu'o]]\n* [[Dai Kumo (Earth-616)|Dai Kumo]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Maikeru Mishu (Earth-616)|Maikeru Mishu]]\n* [[Ogun (Ninja) (Earth-616)|Ogun]] (ninja) {{Dead}}\n* [[Shingen Harada (Earth-616)|Lord Shingen]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Matsu'o Tsurayaba (Earth-616)|Matsu's Tsurayaba]] (ninja) {{Dead}}\n* [[Honikawa (Earth-616)|Honikawa]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth]] (mutant) (foreigner = Caucasian)\n\n===Teams===\n* [[Cyburai (Earth-616)|Cyburai]] (cyborgs)\n| Equipment               = Cybernetics,{{r|X-Factor Vol 1 63|64}} nanotechnology,{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 33}} [[Regenix]],{{r|Old Man Logan Vol 2 31}} cloning technology,{{r|Deadpool Team-Up Vol 1 1}}\n| Transportation          = Shuttle spacecraft,{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} moon rovers,{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} humanoid mecha,{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} battle suits,{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}}\n| Weapons                 = [[Moon-Base Cannon|moon-based frequency cannon]],{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} high-tech firearms (comparable to Hydra or S.H.I.E.L.D.),{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}} energized swords (mecha),{{r|Nick Fury Vol 1 2}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * Unlike the Yakuza in the Marvel Universe, the real-world Yakuza (in contrast to the real-world Triads or Molina) is not into challenging the foreign mafias in their home turf. Yakuza clans have not claimed turf in the United States, Australia, the Philippines, or any other country. The Yakuza pretty much stick to Japan, and though they do operate outside their country, their presence overseas is negligible and it's purely to service other Japanese (tourists and corporate expatriates). Yakuza go overseas primarily to acquire guns, drugs, and women to smuggle into Japan to supply their meth addicts, put women to work in Japan's sex industry, and arm their syndicates. Their involvement overseas is usually in partnership with a local crime syndicate, example bringing Japanese tourists to a brothel operated by a local outfit.{{r|{{cite web|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1265/human-trafficking-the-japanese-commercial-sex-industry-and-the-yakuza-recommendations-for-the-japanese-government|title=Human Trafficking, the Japanese Commercial Sex Industry, and the Yakuza: Recommendations for the Japanese Government|work=Cornell International Affairs Review|first=Amanda|last=Jones|date=2010|accessdate=9 June 2020}}}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://apjjf.org/2012/10/7/Andrew-Rankin/3688/article.html|title=21st-Century Yakuza: Recent Trends in Organized Crime in Japan|work=The Asia-Pacific Journal|first=Andrew|last=Rankin|date=11 February 2012|accessdate=9 June 2020}}}}\n| Links                   = \n* [[Wikipedia:Yakuza|Yakuza at Wikipedia.org]]\n* [https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/organized-crime-japan: Stratfor: Organized Crime in Japan]\n* [https://apjjf.org/2012/10/7/Andrew-Rankin/3688/article.html: Asia Pacific Journal: Recent Trends in the Yakuza]\n* [https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/yakuza.htm: Global Security: Yakuza]\n}}\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Japanese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]"
