Using their mastery of the elements, these four beings created a kingdom on Earth that was unopposed until they tried to extend their rule into the land that would someday be known as Egypt. Here, a young warrior named Dann and a wizard named Garrett joined their two souls to arcane magics and created the [[Ruby Scarab]]. In the hands of Dann, this magical item sapped the powers of the Elementals and banished them to another universe.{{r|Supernatural Thrillers Vol 1 8}}\n\nNothing more was heard of the Elementals until the modern age when they transported the [[N'Kantu (Earth-616)|Living Mummy]] from New York City in order to enlist him in their search for the Ruby Scarab, which they sought to help them take control of the world.{{r|Supernatural Thrillers Vol 1 8}} After the Elementals took the city of Cairo hostage under a force field, Zephyr revealed herself to be opposed to the others, helping N'Kantu, Doctor Skarab, and the others to defeat her former brethren.{{r|Supernatural Thrillers Vol 1 13}} These three Elementals were then banished from Earth by [[Alexi Skarab (Earth-616)|Alexi Skarab]] using the power of the Ruby Scarab. Afterwards, Zephyr accepted an offer to accompany the thieves [[Richard Harper (Earth-616)|Asp]] and [[Miles Olddann (Earth-616)|Olddann]] who had secretly stolen the Ruby Scarab from Doctor Skarab.{{r|Supernatural Thrillers #8|15}}\n\nThe Elementals later returned to Earth in search of Zephyr and the Scarab. They fought [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] and their former ally [[Hecate (Earth-616)|Hecate]], they were defeated one by one.{{r|Ms. Marvel Vol 1 #11|12}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/elementl.htm Elementals at the Marvel Appendix]\n}}\n[[Category:Collector's Museum]]"
