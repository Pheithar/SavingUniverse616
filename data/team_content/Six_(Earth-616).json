While they are called the Six, that only refers to the main teleporters. They are the first stage of the circuit of this type of mutant technology. While in actuality, an additional five mutants are needed for their specific gifts to ensure the process can work and go smoothly and safely during the second stage of the circuit.<!-- {{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1}} -->\n\nAs [[Five (Earth-616)|The Five]] combine their powers in unison and harmony to achieve resurrection, the Six combine their various types of mid-to-long range teleportation powers and the protection and power augmentation needed by the other members to reach different points in space, be it locally in their native universe, other dimensions, or through the multiverse.<!-- {{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1}} -->\n\n===Formation===\nThe Six were formed to help S.W.O.R.D to go anywhere they needed or wanted to be. While demonstrating their power to Magneto, they traveled to an unknown cosmic location, acquiring a pyramid shaped object called the Mysterium Tremendum.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 1}}\n\nThe role of one of the Six \u2014 the Power \u2014 was given to [[Fabian Cortez (Earth-616)|Fabian Cortez]]. Abigail Brand wasn't happy with this choice due to Cortez's treacherous nature, and wanted to replace him as fast as possible. Unfortunately, she couldn't find a fitting mutant with a similar power set; [[Michael Nowlan (Earth-616)|Michael Nowlan]] refused to work for Krakoa, [[Brian Dunlop (Earth-616)|Boost]]'s power could be used only on one mutant at a time, and [[Absolon Mercator (Earth-616)|Mister M]] wasn't available. Eventually, Brand found a good candidate among mutants from [[Arakko (Earth-616)|Arakko]] instead \u2014 [[Khora (Earth-616)|Khora of the Burning Heart]]. Khora agreed to work for the S.W.O.R.D and, after successfully completing a mission to stop the Snark War, she officially replaced Cortez.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 2}}{{r|S.W.O.R.D.

The team consist of 6 teleporters and 5 others whose powers are uniquely needed:\n** A high-level technopathic mutant is needed to adjust and unify the powers of the teleporters for the process, they are called the '''Control''' (currently [[Takeshi Matsuya (Earth-616)|Wiz-Kid]], with [[Forge (Earth-616)|Forge]] as backup).\n** A mutant with the power to form protective exoskeletons is needed for protection of the teleporters through space, they are called the '''Shield''' (currently [[Hisako Ichiki (Earth-616)|Armor]], with [[Sally Blevins (Earth-616)|Skids]] as backup).\n** A power manipulating mutant is needed to increase the powers of the teleporters, they are called the '''Power''' (currently [[Khora (Earth-616)|Khora of the Burning Heart]], who replaced [[Fabian Cortez (Earth-616)|Fabian Cortez]]).{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 5}}\n** A mutant with telescopic/microscopic/spectroscopic vision is needed to examine, see, and discern Kirbon particles, they are known as the '''Eye''' (currently [[Peter Quinn (Earth-616)|Peeper]], with [[Doc (District X) (Earth-616)|Doc]] as backup).\n** A mutant with implosive field generation or similar powers to protect the teleporters from Kirbon fields, they are known as the '''Foundry''' (currently [[Gloria Mu\u00f1oz (Earth-616)|Risque]], with [[Shen Xorn (Earth-616)|Zorn]] as backup).\n** A space-folding mutant is needed to guide the teleportation process, they are known as the '''Guide''' (currently [[Eden Fesi (Earth-616)|Manifold]], with no backup). Any mid-to-long range teleporter can be used considering their availability, but currently listed as stand-ins or replacements for the current team are [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] and [[Illyana Rasputina (Earth-616)|Magik]].\n\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
