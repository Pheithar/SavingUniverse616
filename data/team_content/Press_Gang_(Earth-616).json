They performed any task needed from hard labor to soldiering.\n\nThe Press Gang was created to retrieve mutants who attempted leave and defect to other countries, as this action was not recognized by Genoshan law.\n\nThe Press Gang was an official branch of the Genoshan police force known as the [[Magistrates (Earth-616)|Magistrates]]. The squad consisted of three field operatives and one support operative. It was discovered by the X-Man, [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]], that they were actually mutants working voluntarily for the government, rather than enslaved Genoshan Mutates.{{Citation}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Gang_(comics)\n}}"
