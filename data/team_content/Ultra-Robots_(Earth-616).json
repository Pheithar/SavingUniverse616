Six of them and Dominus were sent to Earth to aid [[Lucifer (Quist) (Earth-616)|Lucifer]] in conquering [[Earth]]. They were able to capture the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], but the X-Men were able to escape and defeat the Ultra-Robots. Dominus was then recovered by the Quists' [[Supreme One (Earth-616)|Supreme One]] while Lucifer was sent into exile.{{r|X-Men #21}}\n\nLucifer later returned to Earth and possessed the bodies of [[Rafe Michel (Earth-616)|Rafe Michel]] and the [[Zodiac Cartel (Earth-616)|Zodiac Cartel]]'s second [[Grover Raymond (Earth-616)|Aries]]. Lucifer discovered that three Ultra-Robots were still operational and sent them to defeat his new nemesis, the [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]]. [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] intervened and managed to destroy the robots. Lucifer eventually left the bodies of Michel and Aries, resulting in their deaths.{{r|Captain America #178}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Flight under their own power\n| Weapons                 = Energy weapons in their hands\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
