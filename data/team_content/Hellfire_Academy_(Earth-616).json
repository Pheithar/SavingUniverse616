While they tried and successfully brought in [[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob Herman]], [[Idie Okonkwo (Earth-616)|Oya]], [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Kid Omega]], along with [[Mortimer Toynbee (Earth-616)|Toad]], they also recruited the new-comers [[Infestation (Earth-616)|Infestation]], [[Mudbug (Earth-616)|Mudbug]] and [[Snot (Earth-616)|Snot]].\n\nDuring the manipulation of Idie into making her to join, Broo was shot in the head by Kade Kilgore, rendering him as feral as a classic [[Brood (Race)|Brood]]. In order to \"cure\" him, [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]] consulted the [[Xanto Starblood (Earth-616)|Dr. Xanto Starblood]], prisoner in the [[Sentient World Observation and Response Department (Earth-616)|S.W.O.R.D.]] station of the [[Peak VII]], but the two aliens were soon recruited by [[Philistine (Earth-616)|The Philistine]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #30}}\n\n[[Owen Backes (Earth-616)|Owen Backes]] was made to join by an agreement between the US military and the Hellfire Club.{{r|X-Men Vol 3 40}}\n\n==Members==\n[[File:Hellfire Academy (Earth-616) from Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 31 0002.png|thumb|right|320px|Hellfire Academy line-up]]\n===Hellfire Club Inner Circle===\n* [[Kade Kilgore (Earth-616)|Black King (Kade Kilgore)]]\n* [[Wilhelmina Kensington (Earth-616)|White Queen (Wilhelmina Kensington)]]\n* [[Manuel Enduque (Earth-616)|White King (Manuel Enduque)]]\n* [[Maximilian Frankenstein (Earth-616)|Black Bishop (Maximilian Frankenstein)]]\n\n===Faculty===\n* [[Dog Logan (Earth-616)|Dog Logan]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #29}} - Senior Staff/Physical Education \n* [[Lord Deathstrike (Earth-616)|Lord Deathstrike]] - Adjunct Staff/Recruiter-Resourcer\n* [[Madame Mondo (Mojoverse)|Madame Mondo]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #31}} - Senior Staff/Public Relations\n* [[Martin Preston (Earth-616)|Master Pandemonium (Martin Preston)]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #31}} - Senior Staff/Hell Lit. \n* [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique (Raven Darkholme)]] - Headmistress/Intro to Evil.\n* [[Victor Creed (Earth-616)|Sabretooth (Victor Creed)]] - Headmaster\n* [[Karl Lykos (Earth-616)|Sauron (Karl Lykos)]] - Senior Staff/Science\n* [[Shingen Harada II (Earth-616)|Silver Samurai (Shingen Harada)]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #31}} - Adjunct Staff/Designer\n* [[Xanto Starblood (Earth-616)|Dr. Xanto Starblood]] - Senior Staff/Xenobiology\n* [[Wendigo (Race)|Wendigo]] - Junior Staff/Danger Room Instructor\n\n===Students===\n* [[Hellions (Hellfire Academy) (Earth-616)|Hellions]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #32}}\n** [[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob Herman (Robert Herman)]]\n** [[Mudbug (Earth-616)|Mudbug (Ledbetter)]]\t\n** [[Infestation (Earth-616)|Infestation]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #31}}\n** [[Snot (Earth-616)|Snot]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #31}}\n** [[Owen Backes (Earth-616)|Tin Man (Owen Backes)]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #31}}\n* Numerous unnamed Hellfire soldiers{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #31}}\n\n===Others===\n* [[Azazel (Earth-616)|Azazel]] - Transportation \n* [[Bamf (Earth-5311)|Azazel Bamfs]]\n* [[Philistine (Earth-616)|The Philistine]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #30}} - Hall Monitor\n* Numerous unnamed Hellfire soldiers{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men #31}} - Guards \n\n===Potential candidates===\nMany students were targeted for recruiting by the Hellfire Club, but did not actually enroll:\n* [[Iara Dos Santos (Earth-616)|Shark-Girl (Iara Dos Santos)]]{{r|Wolverine and the X-Men Vol 1 20}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * The school motto \"Fais ce que tu voudras\" translates from French to English as \"Do whatever you want.\" \n** It was already seemingly the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] motto: \"Fais ce que te voudras\" (\"Do what thou wilt\").{{r|Heroic Age: X-Men #1}}\n** The school motto is also the title of a song written by Quebecois songwriters Eddy Marnay and Ren\u00e9 Grignon and performed by C\u00e9line Dion in 1986.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Schools]]\n[[Category:Hellfire Club Projects]]\n[[Category:Jason Aaron/Creator]]\n[[Category:Nick Bradshaw/Creator]]"
