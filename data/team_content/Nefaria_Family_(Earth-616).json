Italian nobleman, [[Luchino Nefaria (Earth-616)|Count Luchino Nefaria]], a scientific genius, was the world's most powerful Maggia leader until his initial defeat by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]{{r|Avengers Vol 1 #13}}. Afterwards he moved his base of operations to the [[New York City]] area, and then imprisoned [[Washington, D.C.]] within an impenetrable force-dome and held it for ransom. After his defeat and capture, his daughter Giuletta Nefaria, also known as Whitney Frost, succeeded him as family head and led an unsuccessful attempt to capture the advanced weaponry of [[Iron Man (Anthony \"Tony\" Stark)|Tony Stark]]. She was eventually succeeded by a costumed criminal, the [[Frank Farnum (Earth-616)|Masked Marauder]], who demanded complete control of New York City or else he would detonate a nuclear device there.{{r|Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 1 27|28}} After his capture, the family again apparently came under control of Whitney Frost, by then known as [[Giuletta Nefaria (Earth-616)|Madame Masque]]. Contrary to standard Maggia practice, the Nefaria family principally consisted of men under 40, has employed futuristic weaponry and even robots (like the [[Dreadnought]]s), as well as costumed super-powered agents ([[Milos Masaryk (Earth-616)|Unicorn]], [[Marco Scarlotti (Earth-616)|Whiplash]], [[Melvin Potter (Earth-616)|Gladiator]], etc.), and has launched open attacks on society. Its leader is always known as \"Big M.\" \n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = submarines{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 247}}\n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Crime Families]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Italian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Maggia]]"
