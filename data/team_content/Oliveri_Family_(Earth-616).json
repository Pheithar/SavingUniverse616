The [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] encountered several in the Bronx and killed a few. Two wiseguys survived and fled the scene, after which they attempted to an abandoned tenement building. Only to run into a gang of crack dealers, resulting in a gun fight. While the two sides battled it out inside, the Punisher used a crane to bring the building down on them all.{{r|Punisher: War Zone Vol 1 25}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Crime Families]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Italian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Cosa Nostra]]"
