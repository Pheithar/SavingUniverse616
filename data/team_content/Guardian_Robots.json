While he destroyed two Robots by making them collide with each other, he accidentally activated the self-destruct mechanism of the other and was stunned, falling far from the castle.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 198}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[File:Guardianrobot.JPG|thumb|left|Guardian Robot]]\n* Robotic construction: The robot's hull provides it with some protection against attacks. It is also immune to mental, emotional and illusion attacks, but susceptible to machinery-affecting attacks.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}\n* Computer link: Constant communication with security system of Doom, to immediately answer any alarm. Range includes 16 km but can be increased with secondary robots.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}\n| Transportation          = * Three{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}} wheels instead of legs.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 198}}\n| Weapons                 = * Tentacles: Their tentacles allow them to attack non-adjacent foes.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 198}}{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}\n* Force Blasters.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 198}}{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}\n* Knock-out gas.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 198}}{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}\n* Ionic laser: Very powerful,{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 198}} but Doom only provides this robot with a ionic laser if he is waiting a super-powerful attack.{{r|Machines of Doom Vol 1 1}}\n* Override mechanism to prevent the use of jammers. The robots will identify people trying to reprogram them and target those people.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 198}}\n* Self-Destruct: The conductive backplate is designed to prevent tampering. Attempts to remove it and access to internal mechanisms, e.g. to deactive the robot, activate the self-destruct mechanism and the robot explodes.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 198}}\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [[Doctor Doom's robots]]\n* [[Machines of Doom Vol 1 1]]\n}}\n[[Category:Robots (Full Listing)]]\n[[Category:Silver-Age Characters]]\n[[Category:Latverians]]\n[[Category:No Eyes]]\n[[Category:No Hair]]\n[[Category:Silver Skin]]\n[[Category:Doombots]]"
