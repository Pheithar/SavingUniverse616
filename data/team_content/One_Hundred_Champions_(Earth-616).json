To turn the tide of war, the '''One Hundred Champions''' were sent through the dimensional rift into [[Amenth]], led by the [[White Sword (Earth-616)|White Sword]]{{r|X-Men Vol 5 13}}\n\nIn Amenth, the [[White Sword (Earth-616)|White Sword]] and his One Hundred Champions culled the horde of demons, buying the mutants precious time. They established their headquarters in the [[Ivory Spire]], and for thousands of years the One Hundred Champions would fight the daemons of Amenth to the death only to be resurrected by the White Sword each morning and battle again.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 12}}\n\nEventually, the White Sword and his One Hundred Champions were found by [[Genesis (Earth-616)|Genesis]] and her Arakkii mutants, but the thousands of year they spent apart engaged in the continuous cycle of battle, death, and resurrection had alienated the two groups. Genesis and her mutants were badly beaten by the White Sword and his One Hundred Champions.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 12}}{{r|X-Men Vol 5 14}}\n\nDuring [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Saturnyne]]'s [[X of Swords|tournament of champions]], the White Sword was set to face off against [[Tomi Shishido (Earth-616)|Gorgon]] in a sword fight. However, before facing him, the White Sword sent in his One Hundred Swords. After killing 13 of his warriors, the White Sword finished off Gorgon and offered to resurrect him as one of his champions, only for Gorgon to refuse.{{r|Cable Vol 4 6}}\n\nWhen the tournament seemed to be turning in Krakoa's favor, and [[Annihilation (Earth-616)|Annihilation]] summoned its hordes of demons, the White Sword decided to leave the battle, ordering his champions to retreat and return to the Ivory Spire.{{r|X of Swords: Destruction Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 =\n* [[Purity (Sword)|Purity]]\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
