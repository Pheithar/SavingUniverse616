They used a series of thefts commited by various robbers disguised as superheroes and their antagonists as a cover for their operations.\n\nWhen they were trying to steal a shipment full of smuggler's gold in a shipyard, the Octopals were interrupted by [[Tomas Lara-Perez (Earth-616)|Chipmunk Hunk]], [[Ken Shiga (Earth-616)|Koi Boi]] and [[Werner Schmidt (Brain Drain) (Earth-616)|Brain Drain]]. However, the trio's lack of coordination gave [[Doctor Cyberock (Earth-616)|Doctor Cyberock]] a widow of opportunity to escape. While Chipmunk Hunk and Koi Boi were scolding Brain Drain for his failure to work as a team, the other three Octopals fled.\n\nThe following day, the Octopals returned to the shipyard to resume their plan. They were once again confronted by Chipmunk Hunk, Koi Boi and Brain Drain, with the heroes successfully subduing them this time.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 21}}\n\n| Equipment               = [[Doctor Octopus' Tentacles]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The Ocotopals are a parodic reference to [[DC Comics]]' \"[[w:c:dc:Reign of the Supermen|Reign of the Supermen!]]\" storyline, in which four new Superman-inspired characters, [[w:c:dc:Kon-El (New Earth)|Superboy]], [[w:c:dc:Henry Henshaw (New Earth)|Cyborg Superman]], [[w:c:dc:Eradicator (New Earth)|The Last Son of Krypton]] and [[w:c:dc:John Henry Irons (New Earth)|Steel]] took over for [[w:c:dc:Kal-El (New Earth)|Superman]] following his death.\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:DC Comics Pastiches]]"
