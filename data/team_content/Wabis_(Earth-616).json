They attacked the jungle hero [[David Rand (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]] when he was attempting to get [[Rita Grey (Earth-616)|Rita Grey]] back to the safety of her camp after the girl got lost in the jungle. Ka-Zar took the girl up to the top of a mountain to defend her from the Wabis, holding them off until [[Zar (Earth-616)|Zar]] the lion could seek the help of [[Trajah (Earth-616)|Trajah]] the elephant. The elephant's stampede sent the frightened Wabis fleeing into the jungle.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = The Wabis were armed with spears.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
