We provide our clients with weapons. In fact, your friend [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] is one of our best creations. Our current client wanted us to create [[Predator X|a very specific item]], to do a very specific job. He left it to us as to how to proceed.\n| Speaker                 = [[Adam Harkins (Earth-616)|Adam Harkins]]\n| History                 = After the [[Weapon Plus (Earth-616)|Weapons Plus Project]] was shut down, '''the Facility''' was created as a branched-off organization with similar goals of creating genetically altered weapons and soldiers.\n\nUnder the direction of [[Adam Harkins (Earth-616)|Adam Harkins]] this organization created [[Kimura (Earth-616)|Kimura]]; [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]] (a daughter to [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] after failing 22 times to clone him);{{r|X-23 Vol 1 1}} created several [[Homo Superior|mutant]]-hunting [[Predator X]] monsters;{{r|New X-Men Vol 2 34}}{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 516}} and numerous other genetically engineered weapons.{{Citation}}\n\nLater, Kimura assaulted X-23 and [[Cessily Kincaid (Earth-616)|Mercury]], not to capture Wolverine's daughter, but to create a new Predator X using Mercury's power of a liquid metallic body.{{Citation}}\n\nAdam Harkins utilized a red lab in [[Canada]] to use the stolen wings from [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]] to create the [[Choir (Earth-616)|Choir]], an army of winged warriors, for [[Matthew Risman (Earth-616)|Matthew Risman]]'s [[Purifiers (Earth-616)|Purifiers]].{{r|X-Force Vol 3 4}}\n\nReturning from [[Earth-80521|the future]], X-23 was kidnapped by soldiers of [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]] who were revealed to be Facility agents, with the exception of [[Alisande Morales (Earth-616)|Alisande Morales]]. When Kimura was torturing X, Morales helped her to escape.{{Citation}}\n\nX-23 used [[Trigger 42]] on herself to make her a savage killer, and slaughtered many agents of the Facility before being extracted by [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]]. In the ensuing chaos Kimura killed Harkins because he annoyed her, and blamed X-23.{{Citation}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = [[Kimura (Earth-616)|Kimura]], [[Predator X (Earth-616)|Predators X]], [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]]\n| Notes                   = * The actual location of [[The Facility (Location)|the installation]] where X-23 herself was bred was never identified. The only noticeable landmarks place the base in a mountainous, alpine region, with a further clue that [[Sarah Kinney (Earth-616)|Sarah Kinney]] was able to get X-23 from the base to [[San Francisco]] within hours of the kidnapping of her niece, [[Megan Kinney (Earth-616)|Megan]], without being stopped until her return,{{r|X-23 Vol 1 4}} as well as again when [[Sarah Kinney (Clone) (Earth-616)|a clone of Sarah]] was discovered there, thus strongly suggesting it is in fact in the [[Sierra Nevada]].{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 25|26}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Weapon Plus Projects]]\n[[Category:Super-Soldier Programs]]\n[[Category:Weapon X Projects]]"
