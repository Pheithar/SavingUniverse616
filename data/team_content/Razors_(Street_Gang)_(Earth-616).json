They put a man in the hospital for calling the police and threatened to burn the store of anyone else who did the same. Afterwards acting as if they owned the block, they extorted from the stores every week.<!-- {{r|Punisher Vol 2 93}} -->\n\nA kid put up hand written posters, asking for the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]]'s help. The Punisher responded and setup a newsstand, disguising himself as a mentally handicapped overweight store owner. He went to their gang house, and slaughtered them all.{{r|Punisher Vol 2 93}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Gangs]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
