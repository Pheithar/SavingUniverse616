Unlike other prominent criminal organizations (e.g. [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|AIM]]), the Maggia were not involved with any subversive activities. In the United States they eventually ended up controlling most of the nation's loan-sharking, illegal gambling, and narcotics. Protection rackets and prostitution were also very important to the Maggia.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update Vol 1 5}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 620}} \n\nThe Maggia were not a monolithic organization, instead it has consisted of many \"families\", all of which are independent of each other. They usually didn't cooperate much less coordinate with each other, though they normally agreed not to interfere with each other.{{r|Avengers Vol 3 31}} Within the Maggia, bloodlines were usually valued more than brains.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 618}} In Europe, the most powerful Maggia leaders were members of the \"Commission\".{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update Vol 1 5}} Internationally, a few Maggia chieftains have risen to dominance over the other Maggia families. [[Luchino Nefaria (Earth-616)|Count Nefaria]] was for a time the leader of the European Maggia, and perhaps of all the Maggia.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 13}}{{r|Avengers Vol 3 33}} The Afro-Caribbean [[John McIver (Earth-616)|Bushmaster]] later became the head of the European Maggia.{{r|Iron Fist Vol 1 15}} The American Maggia has not yet had anyone unite the families in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nA few Maggia families have recruited or hired superhuman agents, usually the Nefaria family. Within the New York area were several Maggia families, the most prominent ones being the Manfredi and Hammerhead families. The Maggia has partnered or allied with other criminal groups, such as that of [[Boss Morgan (Earth-616)|Boss Morgan]] in [[Harlem]]. The Maggia or individual families within it have also gone to war with various criminal organizations, including both rival crime syndicates (e.g. [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]]'s organization and [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Mister Negative]]'s [[Inner Demons (Earth-616)|Inner Demons]]) and subversive organizations (e.g. [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]]).{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 284|288}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 618|620}}{{r|Iron Man Vol 1 245|247}}\n\nThe Maggia have had their share of clashes with vigilantes and the super-powered community. The Nefaria Family has had confrontations with both the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], and especially [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]]. In New York City, both the [[Manfredi Family (Earth-616)|Manfredi Family]] and [[Hammerhead Family (Earth-616)|Hammerhead Family]] have had dealings with the street-level costumes of the city (e.g. [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]], [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]], and [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]]) as well as the vigilante, [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]]. The Bushmaster clashed repeatedly with [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]] and [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]], and on occasion several Maggia groups have had dealings with [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]].\n\n===Maggia Groups===\n* [[Manfredi Family (Earth-616)|Manfredi Family]]\n* [[Nefaria Family (Earth-616)|Nefaria Family]]\n* [[Hammerhead Family (Earth-616)|Hammerhead Family]]\n* [[Karnelli Family (Earth-616)|Karnelli Family]]\n* [[Costa Family (Earth-616)|Costa Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Libris Crime Family (Earth-616)|Libris Family]]\n\n===Crimelords===\n* [[Luchino Nefaria (Earth-616)|Count Nefaria]] (mutate)\n* [[Giuletta Nefaria (Earth-616)|Madame Masque]] (female)\n* [[John McIver (Earth-616)|Bushmaster]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Silvio Manfredi (Earth-616)|Silvermane]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Top Man (Earth-616)|Top Man]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Edward Lavell (Earth-616)|Eel]]\n* [[Satannish (Earth-616)|Nick Cloot]]\n* [[Bruno Karnelli (Earth-616)|Bruno Karnelli]]\n* [[Olivier (Earth-616)|Frank Costa]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Bruno Costa (Earth-616)|Bruno Costa]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Caesar Cicero (Earth-616)|Caesar Cicero]]\n* [[Lyla DeCriscio (Earth-616)|Lyla DeCrisco]] (female) (Chinese)\n* [[Frank Farnum (Earth-616)|Masked Marauder]]\n* [[T.B.

Outside of the northeast (mainly NY City) and in Chicago (mostly the suburbs) where the Mafia is still strong, the criminal underworld is dominated by other groups and in many major cities the American Mafia no longer have a presence.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mafia|title=American Mafia|date=9 June 2020|accessdate=9 June 2020}}}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/d205853aca1e47c2816f8bb5b0300f30/The-last-Mafioso?-%27Cadillac-Frank%27-trial-shows-mob%27s-decline|title=The last Mafioso? \u2018Cadillac Frank\u2019 trial shows mob\u2019s decline|work=Associated Press|first=Alanna|last=Durkin Richer|date=17 June 2018|accessdate=9 June 2020}}}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/706895|title=The Rise and Fall of Organized Crime in the United States|work=University of Chicago Press|first=James|last=B.
