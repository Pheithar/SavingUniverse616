They were created by [[Miles Warren (Earth-616)|Miles Warren]], a.k.a. the [[Jackal]], who used the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]'s DNA samples he had stolen from [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]]'s vault to give them mutant powers.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 2}}\n\nThe Mutant-Powered Spider-Clones were used by the Jackal to capture both [[Spider-Man]] (actually the supervillain known as [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Doctor Octopus]], who managed to switch bodies with [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]] before his death) and [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spider]] with the intention of collecting fresh DNA samples from them to be used in his future projects.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 2}}{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 20}} However, said DNA samples, as well as the Mutant-Powered Spider-Clones, were destroyed by the explosion caused by Spider-Man in the Jackal's hideout.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 20}}\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\n===Powers===\nThe Mutant-Powered Spider-Clones were shown to possess the following abilities derived from their genetically enhancing based on spider-biology:\n* '''Superhuman Strength'''\n* '''Biological/Organic Webbing Generation:''' The Mutant-Powered Spider-Clones had the ability to organically produce their own silk webbing from glands within their forearms. Although just two of them exhibited such power, it can be assumed that all of them had it.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 2}}\n\nIn addition to that, the Mutant-Powered Spider-Clones were shown to have the powers of some members of the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]:\n* '''Optic Blast:''' Like [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], one of these [[Spider-Clone|Spider-Clones]] was shown to possess the mutant ability to project a powerful beam of concussive, ruby-colored force from its eyes.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 2}}\n* '''Electrokinesis / Electricity Manipulation:''' Like [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], one of these Spider-Clones was shown to be able to create, shape and manipulate electricity, mainly using it to electrify its web in order to electrocute its prey.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 2}}\n* '''Teleportation:''' Like [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]], one of these Spider-Clones exhibited the ability to teleport himself and others in contact with him through a small amount of distance, leaving behind a trail of black smoke.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 2}}\n* '''Cryokinesis:''' Like [[Robert Drake (Earth-616)|Iceman]], one of these Spider-Clones can generate, manipulate and fully control ice.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Clones]]\n[[Category:Clones Created by Miles Warren]]\n[[Category:Human/Spider Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Mutant/Spider Hybrids]]\n[[Category:Mutants cloned/created after M-Day]]"
