The Pilgrims fled the volatile political environment in [[England]]. The colony was established in 1620 A.D. and became the second successful English settlement in North America after the founding of [[Jamestown]]. The Pilgrims story is celebrated in the [[United States of America]] each year in a festival known as '''[[Thanksgiving]]'''. \n\n===Origin===\nThe Pilgrims travelled aboard the [[Mayflower]], from [[Plymouth]] to the [[America|New World]] in the 17th century. At least one member of the [[Clan Akkaba (Earth-616)|Clan Akkaba]] was on board the ship.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}\n\nAnother Pilgrim ship the [[Pandora]] was across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to restart in the New World. One day their ship was swept in a whirlpool that was also a portal into the [[Negative Zone]]. They have spent the centuries fighting [[Annihilus (Earth-616)|Annihilus]] whom they view as the literal Biblical [[Devil]].{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 41}}\n\n===Modern Era=== \nThe [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] discovered the lost ship while travelling the Negative Zone. They also found the pilgrims alive and well performing a funeral service. When the Fantastic Four accidentally revealed their presence they are attacked by the Pligrims who were wielding rifles adapted from Negative Zone technology. The two groups battled but Reed was able to convince them they are not witches or [[demons]] by snatching the Seer's Bible and reading a passage from the Gospel of Luke. When the Fantastic Four apologize for their intrusion on their funeral the pilgrims welcome them into their community. They revealed their village is known as Pilgrim's Rock. However the peace was short lived when Ben was attacked by the Pilgrim's greatest warriors, [[Kenneth Tennyson (Earth-616)|Hellscout]], who had been out on a hunt and is unaware that the Thing is an ally. The two come to blows until Reed, Sue and the elders come and break up the fight. With the fight over the Hellscout was most impressed with the Thing's strength.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 3 41}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:British Organizations]]\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]\n[[Category:Protestantism]]"
