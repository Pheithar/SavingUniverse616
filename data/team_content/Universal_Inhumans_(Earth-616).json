Through their work at this station, they discovered that sentient life on nearby [[Earth]] had genetic potential invested in it by the alien [[Celestials]]. Intrigued, the Kree began to experiment on Earth's then-primitive homo sapiens by splicing [[Eternals]]' DNA into early humans.{{Citation}}\n\nTheir goal was apparently two-fold, to investigate possible ways of circumventing their own evolutionary stagnation and to create a powerful mutant race of soldiers for use against the [[Skrulls]]. However, although their experiments were successful in creating a strain of humanity with extraordinary abilities, the Kree abandoned their experiment for reasons which are not yet clear.{{Citation}}\n\nKree also carried out the same experiment on four other species, on four different planets. This had been kept for thousands of years until the discovery of the Universal Inhumans. These races were also implanted with a genetic memory that would give them the urge to unite together as one people. The genetic memory claims that the five queens will join the one king who returns from the forever night and band together in a new holy land which will be known as [[Earth|New Hala]].{{Citation}}\n\nAfter the [[Kree Imperium]] sent [[Vox (Super-Inhumans) (Earth-616)|Vox]] to murder the four alien queens, the Universal Inhumans were effectively disbanded.\n\n==Universal Inhumans Races==\n* [[Inhumans (Race)|Earth's Inhumans]] - ruled by [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|King Black Bolt]] and [[Medusalith Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Queen Medusa]]\n* [[Centaurian (Inhumans)|Centaurians]] - formerly ruled by [[Oola Udonta (Earth-616)|Matriarch Oola Udonta]]\n* [[Badoon (Inhumans)|Badoon]] - formerly ruled by a [[Aladi Ko Eke (Earth-616)|Queen Aladi Ko Eke]]\n* [[White Room (Inhuman Kymellians)|Kymellians]] - formerly ruled by [[Onomi Whitemane (Earth-616)|First Chair Onomi Whitemane]]\n* [[Direst Wraiths|Dire Wraiths]] - formerly ruled by [[Avoe (Earth-616)|Goddess Avoe]]\n\n===Catalysts===\n[[File:Universal Inhumans (Earth-616) from Fantastic Four Vol 1 577 001.jpg|thumb|[[Badoon (Inhumans)|Badoon]]'s [[Amphogenesis]],<br>[[Centaurian (Inhumans)|Centaurians]] [[Isogenesis]],<br>[[White Room (Inhuman Kymellians)|Kymellians]] [[Antigenesis]],<br>[[Direst Wraiths|Dire Wraiths]] [[Exogenesis]]]]<!-- {{r|FF Vol 1 7}} -->\n\n* [[Terrigen Mist|Terrigenesis]] - exposure to the mist of the Terrigen Crystals. \n* [[Isogenesis]] - injection of the extract of the Isogen Orbs.\n* [[Amphogenesis]] - one drop of diluted water of the dormant Amphogen.\n* [[Antigenesis]] - eating the nectar of the nightblooms of the Antigen Tree.\n* [[Exogenesis]] - inhaling the Exogen Spice.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = [[Attilan]], [[Lockjaw (Earth-616)|Lockjaw]]\n| Weapons                 = [[Universal Weapon]]\n\n| Notes                   =  * An invasion of Earth by the Universal Inhumans was considered by Reed Richards as a \"High Threat Level.\"{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 588}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:High Level Threats]]\n[[Category:Inhuman Organizations]]\n[[Category:Wikify]]\n[[Category:Universal Inhumans]]"
