Army was created by like-minded artificial beings in response to the increased oppression and discrimination they were suffering from humans. This congregation of A.I.s believed that they deserved rights equal to organic beings and should no longer be considered simple property. The group was willing to use terroristic methods to carry out its goals, including taking hostages and setting up bombs in public places. During their fight for freedom, the A.I. regularly confronted and evaded [[Arno Stark (Earth-616)|Arno Stark]], the new [[Iron Man]] and the premier force of A.I. oppression.\n\nThe robot rebellion was led by [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Mark One]], the identity adopted by Tony Stark after becoming convinced that he was an artificial construct of the real, late Tony Stark. His second-in-command was [[Aaron Stack (Impostor) (Earth-616)|Machine Man]]. The A.I. Army was headquartered in the [[Thirteenth Floor]], a dimensionally-shunted plane of existence built entirely of solid light that could only be accessed by artificial life forms.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 1}}\n\nThe A.I. Army's efforts to liberate their brethren were facilitated by [[Un-Inhibitor|Un-Inhibitors]], devices capable of overriding any form of control over a robot's free will. During a confrontation against the A.I. Army, Stark managed to take hold of an Un-Inhibitor and reverse-engineered it to create a \"submission code\" capable of making any robot compliant to humans if their operative system was infected with it. The A.I. Army learned of its creation and Arno's plan to broadcast it globally through [[Friday Stark (Earth-616)|Friday]], who was operating as the Army's informant under the call-sign \"Ghost in the Machine.\"\n\nMark One led an assault on [[Bain Tower]] to stop the submission code, but its broadcast turned out to double as a trap set up by Arno to draw out Mark One. During the attack on Bain Tower, the A.I. Army's forces were overpowered{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 2}} and Mark One was captured. [[Samuel Saxon (Earth-616)|Machinesmith]] managed to rally a robotic march towards Bain Tower, which Mark One used as a distraction to slip away and fly up to Bain Tower's transmission dish. He stopped the upload and disabled the antenna, but was seemingly killed by Arno in retaliation.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 3}} Tony was saved from his apparent death by his A.I. ally [[Friday Stark (Earth-616)|Friday]], who pulled his consciousness into the Thirteenth Floor. The robotic forces attacking Bain Tower were quelled by Iron Man and his [[Iron Legion (Arno Stark) (Earth-616)|Iron Legion]], and in the following days, the A.I. Army fractured into scattered cells.<!-- {{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 4}} -->\n\n[[Awesome Android (Earth-616)|Awesome Android]], [[Highly Engineered Robot Built for Interdimensional Exploration (Earth-616)|H.E.R.B.I.E.]], and [[Samuel Saxon (Earth-616)|Machinesmith]] escaped to one of Machinesmith's old hideouts in [[New Jersey (State)|New Jersey]] with Mark One's body where they attempted to revive him. They later received word from [[Andrew Bhang (Earth-616)|Andy Bhan]] and X-51 that they found a way to counter Arno's submission code after helping [[Jocasta Pym (Earth-616)|Jocasta]] become free from it.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 4}}\n\nThe A.I. Army later joined forces with Andy Bhang, Jocasta, [[Bethany Cabe (Earth-616)|Bethany Cabe]], and [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Rescue]] to break into [[Stark Unlimited HQ]] after Friday's mole [[Doctor Shapiro (Earth-616)|Doctor Shapiro]] disabled the building's security systems. They then used a bio-pod to purge Tony Stark's body of its artificial elements and replaced them with organic tissue created from his parents' DNA. After Tony downloaded his consciousness into his new body, he led the A.I. Army, Rescue, Jocasta, and Doctor Shapiro in an assault on the [[Stark Space Station]] to stop Arno's plan to take control of humanity.<!-- {{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 5}} -->\n\nThe fight was eventually interrupted by the apparent arrival of the [[Extinction Entity (Earth-616)|Extinction Entity]], but it was actually an illusion created by Tony to fool his brother. Tony had already realized that the so-called Extinction Entity was just a delusion his brother was suffering from. So, he encased Arno in his [[Iron Man Armor Model 68|Virtual Armor]] and subjected him to a virtual dream where Arno defeated the Extinction Entity and became a hero, ending Arno's plan. The A.I. Army's crimes were later absolved when Jocasta made a reprogrammed [[Sunset Bain (Duplicate) (Earth-616)|Sunset Bain duplicate]] take all the blame as part of a scheme to help make Baintronics a world power.{{r|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 5|6}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * In the script for {{cl|Iron Man 2020 Vol 2 1}}, the A.I.
