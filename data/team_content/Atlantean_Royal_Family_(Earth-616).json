The brothers [[Orrek (Earth-616)|Orrek]] and [[Stegor (Earth-616)|Stegor]]] fought with the tribe of [[Tanas (Earth-616)|Tanas]] and his wife, [[Elanna (Earth-616)|Elanna]]. Their children, [[Kamuu (Atlantean) (Earth-616)|Kamuu]] (son of Stegor) and [[Zartra (Atlantean) (Earth-616)|Zartra]] (daughter of Tanas and Elanna) would marry, uniting the two tribes and allowing them them to re-take Atlantis.{{Citation}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Atlantean Royal Family]]\n[[Category:Atlantis (Kingdom)]]\n[[Category:Atlantean Organizations]]"
