Attendees included [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Queen Ororo]] (of Wakanda, and daughter of the late [[N'Dar\u00e9 (Earth-616)|Princess N'Dar\u00e9]] of [[Kenya]]), [[Khairi Ngala (Earth-616)|Afrikaa]] (of [[Mohannda]]), [[Zanda (Earth-616)|Zanda]] (the exiled Princess of [[Narobia]]), [[M'Baku (Earth-616)|Man-Ape]] (representing Wakanda's [[Jabari-Lands|Jabari Tribe]]), [[Moses Magnum (Earth-616)|Moses Magnum]] (of [[Canaan]]), and [[Joshua N'Dingi (Earth-616)|President N'Dingi]] (of [[Mbangawi]]).{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report Vol 1 1}}\n\nAlthough the representatives failed to reach an agreement before the Congress disbanded, King T'Challa thereafter embarked on a diplomatic tour, visiting many nations deemed hostile to United States interests, such as [[Latveria]], [[Attilan]], and [[Atlantis]].  The [[United States Department of State (Earth-616)|U.S. State Department]] feared that those rogue nations, who believed that the U.S. now planned to use the international organization known as [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to export the SHRA abroad, were forming an international coalition to oppose the spread of superhuman registration legislation to other countries.{{r|Civil War: Battle Damage Report Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Government Organizations]]"
