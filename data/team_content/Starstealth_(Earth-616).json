At first, they were satisfied to attack other races, ensuring that theirs was not the only race to suffer.{{r|Force Works Vol 1 1}} Eventually, they somehow located a [[Recorder RE-404 (Earth-616)|Rigellian Recorder]], which contained orders for them to destroy [[Simon Williams (Earth-616)|Wonder Man]] and the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]] for their roles in [[Hala (Planet)|Hala's]] destruction.{{r|Force Works Vol 1 14}} They went into cryogenic suspension and headed for Earth.{{r|Force Works Vol 1 1}}\n\nOnce they arrived on Earth, Lo ordered the team to assault the [[Avengers Compound]]. While [[Force Works (Earth-616)|Force Works]] handled the team, Wonder Man headed into space to take care of the ion cannon Lo was firing from their ship in orbit. The explosion of the cannon dispersed Wonder Man's atoms, at the time thought to have been his death.{{r|Force Works Vol 1 1}}\n\nStarstealth was incarcerated at the [[Vault (Prison)|Vault]] and the Rigellian Recorder remained with Force Works, its true mission unknown to them. The Recorder eventually took over the security system at the Vault, allowing Starstealth to escape. Although Kalen Lo was captured, the others escaped. The remaining unnamed members did not survive the battle with Force Works that followed, but Stug Bar and Zamsed were captured. Kalum Lo, Stug Bar, and Zamsed were all turned over to the Interstellar War Tribunal.{{r|Force Works Vol 1 12|14}}\n\n| Equipment               = Warsuits made from [[Kree Sentries|Kree Sentry]] technology\n| Transportation          = Starship Retribution\n| Weapons                 = Ion cannon, Walking Sentry-head (mecha-like)\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Kree Organizations]]"
