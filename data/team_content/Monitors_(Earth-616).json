Hailing from the planet [[Marvan]], they came from a society that had reach the pinnacle of perfection. With no further drive to improve themselves, the Monitors were formed and sent out into the cosmos to find inhabited worlds and determine if they were worthy of continued existence. To assist them on this mission they also included three humanoid robots named [[Kallara (Earth-616)|Kallara]], [[Milandra (Earth-616)|Milandra]] and [[Askare (Earth-616)|Askare]] who helped operate their testing devices. Over the centuries the Monitors found no world that fit their rigid ideas of perfection and they were destroyed. However with each planet they eliminated, their three robots grew to have emotions and became horrified by what they were charged to do. Ultimately they reached the planet Earth and here Kallara and her fellow robots enlisted the aid of the novice hero [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]] and the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four's]] [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]] to try and stop the Monitors. During the ensuing battle, Ingesteev and Kordazt were slain fighting the heroes. With their mission aborted, Nygorn was offered an ultimatum from his former slaves: return with them to Marvan to convince their ruler, [[Suzerain (Earth-616)|King Suzerain]] the errors of his way. Not wishing to do battle with his foes, Nygorn conceded and left with the three female robots. {{R|Marvel Two-In-One Annual #3}}\n\n| Equipment               = '''Planetary analyzers''': tripod like devices that drill into the core of a planet to run tests to determine if the world the Monitors are on is considered worthy.
