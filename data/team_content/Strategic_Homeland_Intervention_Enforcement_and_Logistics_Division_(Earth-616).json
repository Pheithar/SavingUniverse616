Helicarrier from Strange Tales Vol 1 135.jpg|thumb|left|The Helicarrier]]\nAs director, Colonel Fury took a very active hand in S.H.I.E.L.D. operations, often going into the field himself on their most important missions. Supporting him, aside from the thousands of rank-and-file S.H.I.E.L.D. agents working around the world, were a core group of capable officers. Fury's aide-de-camp was the man who had filled the same function for his [[Howling Commandos (WWII) (Earth-616)|Howling Commandos]] in World War II, the boisterous [[Timothy Dugan (Earth-616)|Timothy 'Dum Dum' Dugan]]. Another ex-Howler joined S.H.I.E.L.D. in the person of [[Gabriel Jones (Earth-616)|Gabe Jones]], whose presence had made the Howlers the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|Army]]'s first racially integrated unit. There was also the by-the-books [[Jasper Sitwell (Earth-616)|Jasper Sitwell]], who balanced and sometimes clashed with the more emotional members of the command staff. The brilliant [[Sidney Levine (Earth-616)|Sidney 'The Gaffer' Levine]] acted as head of Research & Development, designing many high-tech specialty gadgets to supplement the weapons and vehicles provided by [[Stark Enterprises]]. Later, [[Laura Brown (SHIELD) (Earth-616)|Laura Brown]], the daughter of the [[Arnold Brown (Earth-616)|Imperial Hydra]], defected from Hydra to join S.H.I.E.L.D.. [[James Woo (Earth-616)|Jimmy Woo]], hero of clashes with the villainous [[Plan Chu (Earth-616)|Yellow Claw]], served as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s FBI liaison agent. [[Clay Quartermain (Earth-616)|Clay Quartermain]] was a resident 'pretty boy' super-agent. [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Earth-616)|La Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]] ('Val' to her friends), a member of the European jet-set, proved to be equally skilled, as well as one of Fury's lovers. Another prominent member was [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter (Agent 13)]], a frequent partner and eventual lover of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]. \n\nThe equipment of S.H.I.E.L.D. has always been at least as distinctive as its membership. A series of flying fortresses invariably known as the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]] served as the mobile headquarters of the organization. Other vehicles such as [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Hoverflier|hoverfliers]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Flying Car|flying cars]] and tunneling vehicles rounded out S.H.I.E.L.D.'s vehicle complement. Agents carried a variety of personal gear as well. Fury's weapon of choice was a 300-round .15 caliber pistol specially designed to fire explosive-tipped needles. Tear gas boutonnieres, explosive shirts, rear-view periscope hats, camera-phone watches, [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Flight Pack|jetpacks]], cigars laced with various chemical compounds (including flash bombs), and other tools of the spy trade insured that S.H.I.E.L.D. agents always had access to the right equipment. One of the most distinctive inventions of The Gaffer was the [[Life-Model Decoy]] (LMD), an extremely lifelike android designed to emulate the behavior of a specific individual, usually used to replace someone in danger of being killed. During the Cold War S.H.I.E.L.D. also maintained a large headquarters in New York City, as well as other bases in every major city in the Western world, and hidden outposts in many Communist countries. \n\nVarious specialized teams of agents have been utilized, such as the Psi Division and [[SHIELD Super Agents|Super Agents]]. At one time, S.H.I.E.L.D. had command over an incarnation of the [[Hulkbusters (S.H.I.E.L.D.) (Earth-616)|Hulkbusters]]. Throughout the years, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents have left the service to perform acts both heroic and villainous. Some went rogue, such as [[Mentallo]], becoming threats to society. Others, like [[Wendell Vaughn (Earth-616)|Quasar]], joined the superhero community. Since the early days, S.H.I.E.L.D., through Fury, has maintained close ties to groups like the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]], and with individuals like [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Natasha Romanoff (Earth-616)|Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff)]], and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], ensuring that a capable and varied pool of special operatives were readily available. That said, S.H.I.E.L.D. often came into conflict with members of the superhero community who worked through less than legal means or against government aims. Fury's friendships with many superheroes conflicted with his duties in these cases.\n\n===Exploits===\nS.H.I.E.L.D.'s main enemy, Hydra, continued to be a threat throughout Nick Fury's first years as director. It became apparent that Fury's old wartime foe, [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron von Strucker]], had become the new [[Supreme Hydra]], with plans to to menace the world with a deadly biological weapon. Fury took the fight to the enemy stronghold, [[Hydra Island]], turning this weapon on its makers.\n\nWhen [[Godzilla (Earth-616)|Godzilla]] was freely roaming the earth, a task force under Dum Dum Dugan's command, the [[Godzilla Squad (Earth-616)|Godzilla Squad]], set forth to capture him. They used a smaller version of the Helicarrier called the Behemoth, as well as a giant robot called [[Red Ronin (UJ1-DX) (Earth-616)|Red Ronin]], before Godzilla disappeared into the Atlantic.\n\nAnother great threat was formed as a result of a lapse in S.H.I.E.L.D. security, when the supervillain [[Jacob Fury (LMD) (Earth-616)|Scorpio]], actually Fury's brother Jake, stole the LMD technology to create the second team of villains called the [[Zodiac Cartel (Earth-616)|Zodiac]]. \n\nThe first dismantling of S.H.I.E.L.D. occurred in the wake of a wide-scale infiltration of the agency, again involving LMDs. In this case, a group of LMDs attained sentience, infiltrating both S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra, replacing key members of both before being defeated by Fury and an impromptu force of allies.\n\nThe reorganized S.H.I.E.L.D. was backed by the United Nations, with the acronym now standing for 'Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage and Logistics Directorate'. Shortly after, Baron Strucker, long thought to have died on Hydra Island, returned as the new head of Hydra and the organizations again clashed. The new organization had some internal structural changes, with the eight-rank system being replaced by a ten-rank one. Also, there existed \"Full Champion License\", a rarely-awarded accolade known to be held by Captain America, whereby the holder has authority to assemble any team they sees fit for any mission they see fit. This was the legal basis for the formation of the [[New Avengers (Earth-616)|New Avengers]].\n\nIn the wake of Nick Fury's [[Secret War]] in [[Latveria]], he was removed from the directorship and forced into hiding. His replacement was not one of his close associates in the high ranks, but a newcomer, [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Commander Maria Hill]]. Her appointment by the U.S. president was meant to ensure S.H.I.E.L.D. bias towards American interests, and her lack of connection to the superhero community was meant to keep S.H.I.E.L.D. from aiding them. This came to the fore when S.H.I.E.L.D. units nicknamed 'Cape-Killers' were tasked with enforcing the [[Superhuman Registration Act]]. Just prior to the first superhuman [[Civil War (Event)|Civil War]], Captain America estimated that there were 3,000 S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on active duty.{{r|New Avengers Vol 1 #21}}\n\nTowards the end of that conflict, Commander Hill decided that she had been made Executive Director so that she would fail. She proposed that [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] take the job, with her as deputy director. After the victory of his Pro-Registration superhero unit, he accepted the appointment. Stark undertook a series of initiatives, including the construction of a new gold-and-red Helicarrier in the motif of his Iron Man designs, the introduction of a daycare center in the Helicarrier, and an employee suggestion-box. While accused of treating S.H.I.E.L.D. as a Stark Industries subsidiary, he succeeded in streamlining the organization and raising morale. \n\nS.H.I.E.L.D. fought a wave of global superhuman terrorism under Stark's command, but was manipulated into two international incidents that almost saw Stark arrested, until it was revealed that [[Mandarin (Earth-616)|Mandarin]] was behind the smear and was stopped from committing genocide with an [[Extremis]] pathogen.\n\n===H.A.M.M.E.R.===\nAt the start of the [[Secret Invasion]] by the extraterrestrial shape-shifting [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]], the Helicarrier was disabled by a Skrull virus and left floating and disabled in the Bermuda Triangle. By this point the Skrulls had already replaced a large number of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, including the high-ranking 'Dum-Dum' Dugan. After the invasion was repelled (thanks in part to Nick Fury and his [[Secret Warriors (Earth-616)|Secret Warriors]]), the President of the United States decided to dissolve S.H.I.E.L.D., and had it, the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|50 States Initiative]], the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts Initiative]] put under the authority of the public hero of the invasion: [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]], head of [[OsCorp]] and the original Green Goblin.  \n\nOsborn used the opportunity to transform S.H.I.E.L.D. into '[[H.A.M.M.E.R.]]' and seemingly disbanded the Thunderbolts. In reality he turned the latest Thunderbolts into a black-ops force to do his dirty work. He also founded the newest government-sponsored Avengers team, colloquially known as the [[Dark Avengers (Earth-616)|Dark Avengers]]. Finally, he set up a [[Dark Illuminati|Cabal]] formed by some of the most powerful beings on Earth, including himself, [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]], [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]], [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] and the [[Parker Robbins (Earth-616)|Hood]].\n\n[[File:S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier above Utopia.jpg|thumb|right|Above Utopia]]\n===After the Siege===\nFollowing the Siege of Asgard and the revelation of Osborn's insanity, the U.S. government disbanded H.A.M.M.E.R. Although [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]], now installed in Osborn's position by the U.S. president, had the opportunity of rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D., he decided to instead rely solely on his shadow ops task force, the [[Secret Avengers (Black Ops Unit) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]].\n\n===Reinstatement===\nAfter the return of [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] and [[H.A.M.M.E.R. (Earth-616)|H.A.M.M.E.R.]], Steve Rogers rebuilt S.H.I.E.L.D. from the ground up with agents who could be trusted, building a new Helicarrier and giving [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Daisy Johnson]] directorship.{{r|Battle Scars Vol 1 2}} The new S.H.I.E.L.D. subsequently saved [[United States Army Special Forces (Earth-616)|U.S. Army Ranger]] [[Nicholas Fury, Jr. (Earth-616)|Marcus Johnson]] from mercenaries hired by the [[Leviathan]], and when he discovered he was the son of [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]], he and his army friend [[Phillip Coulson (Earth-616)|Phil Coulson]] joined the storied security agency.{{r|Battle Scars Vol 1 6}}\n\nOne of the first measures of the new S.H.I.E.L.D. against the appearance of new super-human threats was to create their [[Secret Avengers (S.H.I.E.L.D.) (Earth-616)|own Avengers unit]].{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 1}}\n\nAfter director [[Daisy Johnson (Earth-616)|Daisy Johnson]] broke the protocols by sending the [[Secret Avengers (S.H.I.E.L.D.) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]] to kill [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] leader [[Andrew Forson (Earth-616)|Andrew Forson]], Quake was suspended indefinitely and Maria Hill was put in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. once more.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 2 5}}\n\n[[File:Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616) from Black Widow Vol 6 8 001.jpg|thumb|left]]\n===Time Runs Out===\nEight months into the future, S.H.I.E.L.D. had taken over the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and was helping them hunt down the [[Illuminati (Earth-616)|Illuminati]] to make the organization answer for destroying incursive worlds, which endangered the safety of Earth as a consequence of the multiversal phenomena known as [[Glossary:Incursion|incursions]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 35}}\n\nAfter locating the Illuminati in [[Spain]], S.H.I.E.L.D. sent in the Avengers to capture its members. However, this was a trap set by the Illuminati, who attempted to subdue the Avengers with help from [[New Avengers (A.I.M.) (Earth-616)|Sunspot's Avengers]].{{r|Avengers Vol 5 39}} S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Avengers and Illuminati eventually agreed to a truce and work together to find a way to stop the incursions.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 40}}\n\n===S.H.I.E.L.D. Act and Dissolution===\nFollowing the end of the incursion crisis and the resurgence of Hydra, marked by its employ of guerrilla tactics to create a climate of fear and anxiety through the United States and Europe,{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2016 (Captain America)}} Captain America and Sharon Carter proposed to the U.S. Senate Select Committee the creation of a bill known as the [[S.H.I.E.L.D. Act]].{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 4}} Unbeknownst to anybody, at this point Captain America had been secretly supplanted by [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|a fascist version of himself]] from an alternate timeline that acted as a sleeper agent for Hydra.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 2}}\n\nOnce the bill was signed into law with bipartisan support in Congress,{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 10}} it drastically expanded S.H.I.E.L.D.'s authority within the United States in areas concerned with law enforcement, mass surveillance, and resource allocation, even allowing the organization to become the de facto \"top cop\" in an event of a national state of emergency.{{r|Civil War II: The Oath Vol 1 1}} The passing of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Act coincided with the reinstatement of Captain America as director of S.H.I.E.L.D. after Maria Hill faced trial and was found guilty for the events that occurred in the secret superhuman prison known as [[Pleasant Hill]], which led to her deposition.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 10}}\n\nThis fascist Captain America subsequently manipulated the events behind three crises that hit the world at the same time: a [[Chitauri]] invasion, the [[Army of Evil (Earth-616)|Army of Evil]]'s attack on [[Manhattan]], and Hydra's uprising in [[Sokovia]]. The escalation of these events put into action S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new powers, and control of the United States was handed over to him. Using hypnotist [[Johann Fennhoff (Earth-616)|Doctor Faustus]], Hydra took over an entire S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, whose forces combined with Hydra took over the entirety of the organization. As Captain America conquered the United States, all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s resources were essentially absorbed by Hydra.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} After the fall of Hydra's empire, what remained of S.H.I.E.L.D. was effectively dissolved,{{r|Secret Empire Omega Vol 1 1}} though for a brief period of time they continued to guard black sites prisons,{{r|Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol 1 23}} while transferring prisoners,{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 3 29}} as well as turning over numerous artifacts to the U.S. Army.{{r|Marvel Legacy Vol 1 1}}\n\n==Other Members==\n{{Main|Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)/Members}}\n| Equipment               = Various including: [[Airborne Nano-Camera|A.N.C.]], Beta-cloth, Kevlar body armor, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.
