And we will not misstep as we have in the past. No more armies hitting the beach. No more invasions. Let the air-breathers have their mounds of dirt and blackened skies. We fight for the '''seas,''' and those who called them home. The surface world has their [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. Now '''we''' have the '''[[Defenders of the Deep (Earth-616)|Defenders of the Deep]].'''\n| Speaker                 = [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]]\n| QuoteSource             = Avengers Vol 8 9\n\n| HistoryText             = The Defenders of the Deep were established by [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|King Namor]] of [[Atlantis]] to accomodate to his new policies regarding relationships between the ocean and the surface world. Namor declared the oceans off-limits to all but their native inhabitants, and used the Defenders of the Deep to drive off any human presence on the ocean.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 9}}\n\nAfter tearing down [[Russia|Russian]] submarines in the [[Black Sea]], the Defenders of the Deep attacked the international undersea research station [[Hydropolis]]. They were intercepted by the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], and a fight broke out after the heroes attacked Namor's [[Piranhas (Earth-616)|Piranhas]] to stop them from eating two bystanders despite Namor ordering them to stand down. The [[Winter Guard (Earth-616)|Winter Guard]] arrived to retaliate against the attack on the Black Sea, and worked with the Avengers to take down Namo's team. During the fight, [[Manowar (Earth-616)|Manowar]] was killed by [[Dimitri Bukharin (Earth-616)|Crimson Dynamo]]. However, tensions between the Avengers and the Winter Guard arose after [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|She-Hulk]] attacked [[Perun (Earth-616)|Perun]] and [[Chernobog (Earth-616)|Chernobog]] to stop their in-fighting. While the Avengers and the Winter Guard fought each other, Namor killed the Piranhas due to their continued misconduct and ordered the Defenders to retreat.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 10}}\n\nThe Defenders of the Deep next attacked a Roxxon oil drilling platform in [[Alaska (State)|Alaska]], but they were repelled by the [[Squadron Supreme of America (Earth-616)|Squadron Supreme of America]], at the expense of [[Orka (Earth-616)|Orka]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 11}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
