They consisted of war hero [[K-4 (Earth-616)|Captain K-4]], French fighter ace [[Rene D'Auvergne (Earth-616)|Lt. Rene D'Auvergne]], and British actor turned soldier [[Ronald Wolverstone-Clodd (Earth-616)|Lt. Ronald Wolverstone-Clodd]]. During the course of the war, there are three recorded adventures of the Sky Devils.\n\nIn their first recorded adventure, they came to the rescue of a Allied fighter plane attacked by [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Luftwaffe]] fighters. Later, K-4 infiltrated a Nazi ammo base and set it to explode. Being discovered, K-4 managed to set off the explosions and was rescued by Rene and Ronald.{{r|Daring Mystery Comics Vol 1 2}} Later, the Sky-Devils were assigned to track down a zeppelin that managed to bomb [[London (England)|London]] near the Thames River. They infiltrated its hidden air base and learn its next target was [[Paris]], [[France]]. K-4 personally took the zeppelin down before it could complete its next mission.{{r|Daring Mystery Comics Vol 1 4}} In their final recorded mission, Rene and Ronald were sent to photograph a Nazi air and marine base only to be captured. Learning that the Nazis were planning an attack, they broke out and warned K-4 who led an Allied surprise attack and decimated the base, rescuing his comrades before they could be killed by the Nazis,{{r|Daring Mystery Comics Vol 1 5}}\n\nIn the early days of the year 1940, the Sky-Devils were assigned by [[Samuel Sawyer (Earth-616)|Captain Samuel Sawyer]] to fly [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] and [[Red Hargrove (Earth-616)|Red Hargrove]] into Nazi Germany to assist Nazi scientist [[Abraham Erskine (Earth-616)|Abraham Erskine]] flee to the United States.{{r|Marvels Project Vol 1 2}} In the summer of 1940, they were assigned to aid Fury and Hargrove in attacking secret Nazi fortresses. In one of their raids, they destroyed a Nazi lab in Frankfurt, Germany. It not only further frustrated Nazi efforts to create a [[Super-Soldier Serum]] but also freed World War I hero [[John Steele (American Soldier) (Earth-616)|John Steele]] from stasis.{{r|Marvels Project Vol 1 3}} Later, in the fall of that year, Steele joined the Sky-Devils, Fury, and Hargrove in attacking Nazi operations across Germany.{{r|Marvels Project Vol 1 4}} After witnessing a massacre of villagers in early 1941 -- including women and children -- caused by the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]], the Sky-Devils were ordered to return to Britain, leaving John Steele behind to continue fighting Nazi forces alone.{{r|Marvels Project Vol 1 5}} Of these covert missions in Nazi Germany, it is unknown which members of the Sky-Devils were involved in these missions. \n\nThe Sky Devil's subsequent activities during the war remain unrevealed. \n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Typically the Sky-Devils flew American model fighter planes. They used other vehicles as needed.\n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Government Organizations]]\n[[Category:British Organizations]]\n[[Category:Allied Organizations]]"
