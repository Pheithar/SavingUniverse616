Following [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|Mayor Jameson]]'s resignation, the Fact Channel asked him to come to the Fact Channel Studios. Thinking it was a televised interview, he went on the defensive and said he would not apologize about anything he'd done as a mayor. However, the reporter revealed they wanted to offer him a job as an on-air personality. Jonah accepted, saying that \"the medium of television [had] finally justified its existence\".{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 3}}\n\nJameson's first night on the air didn't go as planned. He was bumped from the first segment due to a conflict of interest, since the subject of the report was [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]]. An assault by [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] and [[Maxwell Dillon (Earth-616)|Electro]] led to a fight between the two villains, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], and [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Silk]]. Jonah insisted that the cameras keep rolling, excited to be broadcasting exclusive footage of the conflict as it unfolded right in their studio.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 5}}\n\nBut Jameson's own ego soon proved to be his undoing. The battle culminated in Black Cat pinning Spidey down and removing his mask, attempting to reveal his identity to the world. Her plain failed, though, due to a grandstanding Jonah accidentally blocking the shot.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 6}}\n\nLittle time later, they opened an internship spot and, within an hour, [[Cindy Moon (Earth-616)|Cindy Moon]] appeared to apply for the position.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 3 6}}\n\n===New U Disaster===\nWhen a new biotech company named [[New U Technologies (Earth-616)|New U Technologies]] appeared, claiming they could resurrect the dead and cure any disease, [[Rita Clarkson (Earth-616)|Dr. Rita Clarkson]] met with J. Jonah Jameson and, to prove there was no limits to what New U could do, they introduced him to his reanimated wife, [[Marla Madison (Earth-616)|Dr. Marla Madison-Jameson]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 16}} who prompted her husband to use his position at the Fact Channel News to promote New U Technologies.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 19}}\n\nJonah travelled to [[San Francisco]], where [[New U Headquarters]] was located, to see his beloved wife, but the New U ended up being a fraud, cloning its patients, instead of curing them.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 1}} Things then went from bad to worse, as Doc Ock set off a signal emitting the frequency responsible for clone decay and piped it throughout the base, turning every clone into [[Carrion|Carrions]]. [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Ben Reilly]], who was secretly behind the company, decided to broadcast the decaying signal across the entire world, via Fact Channel News, causing an outbreak of the [[Carrion Virus]] globally.{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 4}}\n\nDespite the complicacy, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] managed to stop the decaying worldwide and save the world{{r|Clone Conspiracy Vol 1 5}} but Jonah was fired and Cindy quit.{{r|Silk Vol 2 18}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:American Organizations]]\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:News Networks]]"
