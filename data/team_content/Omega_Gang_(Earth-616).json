Quentin was already one of a handful of students who challenged authority and actively questioned the philosophies behind [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Xavier\u2019s]] dream. When he learned that he was adopted, Quentin had an identity crisis. He used the power-enhancing drug [[Hypercortisone D|Kick]] and adopted a hairstyle and mode of dress that mimicked an artist\u2019s rendering of mutant oppressors that appeared in a newspaper on the day he was born. He gathered together other like-minded students and together they perpetrated a series of hate crimes against humans in [[Salem Center]]. They then made a move against the Institute by holding Professor Xavier hostage and instigating a riot during the school\u2019s Open Day ceremonies. The Omega Gang was defeated through the combined efforts of the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]. Quentin evolved into a non-corporeal entity and is dormant in [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Hank McCoy\u2019s]] laboratory. The remaining members of the Omega Gang are serving time in prison.{{Citation}}\n\n==Omega Gang==\n*[[Robert Herman (Earth-616)|Glob Herman]], (Robert Herman) - Glob Herman was injured after setting himself aflame and going on a rampage.
