Adrenamix subjected their prisoners to psionic experiments which led to a wide variety of superhuman powers.  \n\nPresident and CEO Anderson Gaulthing referred to this batch of test subjects as the \"Psigns of the Times\". One of the Psigns was his own daughter Alison Gaulthing. Alison attempted to escape from the Adrenamix facility and the Psigns were sent to retrieve her. They chased her across a rooftop near [[Yancy Street]], but Alison died while trying to evade capture. The Psigns began to fear that they would be blamed for her death. Investigating the Adrenamix activities was the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warrior]] known as [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]]. Justice fought against the Psigns.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/psignsofthetimesjusticeastro.htm Psigns of the Times at the Marvel Appendix] \n}}"
