Initially, they banded together to help evacuate the city and to keep the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk's]] rampage contained. Their efforts centered around the passionate goal of young [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Amadeus Cho]], who believed that the Hulk could be reasoned with. [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] field commander [[Gabriel Jones (Earth-616)|Gabriel Jones]] deputized them for the duration of the Hulk War because he recognized that Cho's superior intellect might give them an advantage whereas military might failed.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 107}}{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 109}}\n\nThe Renegades learned that the Hulk and his loyal followers, the [[Warbound (Earth-616)|Warbound]], were creating their own gladiatorial arena in the heart of [[Manhattan]] where they were torturing fallen superheroes. The Renegades infiltrated [[Madison Square Garden]] where the arena had been built and found notable heroes such as [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] bound by [[Obedience Disk|obedience disks]] that robbed them of the ability to fight back.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 109}} Following World War Hulk, the team disbanded though [[Hercules Panhellenios (Earth-616)|Hercules]] and Amadeus Cho remained in the [[New York City]] area where they conducted a strategic attack against S.H.I.E.L.D. and [[Ares (Earth-616)|Ares]] after an attempt to force them to capitulate to their demands.{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 112}}{{r|Incredible Hercules Vol 1 113|115}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Formerly the Amphibicraft{{r|Incredible Hulk Vol 2 111}}\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
