The gang was involved in the manufacturing and dealing meth, and was into raping and pillaging. It had a number of clubs and they were led by Hec Birch, the club president who was based near Soda Springs with 30% of their strength. The [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] infiltrated his club, posing as a meth cook. \n\nSoon afterwards, they were attacked by their rivals the [[Galloping Geese (Earth-616)|Galloping Geese]] who took out the meth lab. Hec escaped with the Punisher to his girlfriend's hacienda to get more chemicals to setup a new meth lab. Getting high on meth, he became paranoid and turned on his lover (who was married) and the Punisher, believing they were in league with her husband. In the process he lost the chemicals and soon afterwards his life.{{r|Punisher Vol 2 31}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Gangs]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
