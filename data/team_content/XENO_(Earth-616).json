She was captured and held for experimentation, yielding the use of grafts from Domino's skin to mask XENO's soldiers as [[Homo superior|mutants]] so they could invade the mutant nation of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]] without raising alarm. There they carried out a massacre, slaughtering many mutants including one of [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|their main leaders]], [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]].{{r|X-Force Vol 6 1}}\n\nDuring the autopsy of the murderers' bodies, the mutants discovered that they were bioengineered killers. In search of more answers about the attack [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]] went to South Korea where in a shed belonging to XENO, they found a factory created to raise murderers, and Domino in a tank with half her skin ripped off.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 2}}\n\nWolverine, Domino, and Quire managed to escape the factory, and in order to leave no trace, the group exploded the deposit, destroying any evidence of its existence.{{r|X-Force Vol 6 3}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          =\n| Weapons                 =\n\n| Notes                   = * The group's name is based on the word \"Xenophobia\".\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
