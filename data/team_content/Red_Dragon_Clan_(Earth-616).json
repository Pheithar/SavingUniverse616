It was involved in drugs, weapons, prostitution, and assassinations. Years ago, a renegade faction of the Red Dragon was attempting to expand their operations in NY City.\n\nThe warriors of the Red Dragon Clan were fierce fighters, who were well-trained and disciplined. [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]] and the [[Daughters of the Dragon (Earth-616)|Daughters of the Dragon]] were recruited by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|F.B.I.]] to help them protect a former Red Dragon turned FBI informant against a renegade faction of the Red Dragons.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 133|136}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = It appears that the writers / editors got the Japanese and Chinese underworlds mixed up. There are no \"Tongs\" in Japanese society, either legitimate Tongs or criminal Tongs. The lodges known as \"Tongs\" are part of Chinese culture, and can be either legitimate business lodges, criminal lodges (Triads), legitimate community lodges, criminally-influenced business lodges, or political lodges (revolutionary secret societies).\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Japanese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Yakuza]]"
