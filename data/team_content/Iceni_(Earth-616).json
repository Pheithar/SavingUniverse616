Overwhelmed by the Roman Legions, the sect sacrificed themselves but placed their spirits inside the ancient [[London (England)|Londinium]] awaiting the arrival of a powerful matriarch who would awaken them.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 167}} \n\n===[[Whitechapel Murders]]===\nThis happened when the spirits felt the presence of [[Satana Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Satana]], who was traveling in the past alongside the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]]. At that point the spirits took possession of the corpses of indigent victims, including the victims of [[Jack the Ripper (Earth-616)|Jack the Ripper]]. Clashing with the Thunderbolts and Satan's refusal to join their struggle, the Iceni were soundly defeated and all were eliminated.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 166|167}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:British Organizations]]\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]"
