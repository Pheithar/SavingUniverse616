After a fateful encounter with the time-traveling [[T'Challa (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Ghost Panther]] who traveled there to restore the timeline by putting an end to the Martian invasion teamed up with the Defenders to do just that. \n\nThe Defenders, with the help of T'Challa's spirit of vengeance companion [[Zarathos (Warp World) (Earth-616)|Zarathos]] possessed [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]] and used the echo of the tortured planet to deliver vengeance on it's ungrateful children. The attack was a success with the Martian's defeat but T'Challa noticed only a small change within the timeline which also left him stranded in the future with the Defenders.{{r|Secret Warps: Ghost Panther Annual Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Infinity Warps]]"
