To most of the cosmos it is known only by rumor and considered by some to be a myth. It is led by a \"Collective\" of which [[Sharada Darthri (Earth-616)|Sharada Darthri]] is a member and the organization has members from various species.\n\nTo achieve their goal, Sharada experimented on various races, combining their genetic lines. At some point after the death of [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Emperor Vulcan]] his [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|wife]] was captured by the Order. However they weren't really interested in Deathbird herself, but only in her child - a hybrid of atavistic [[Shi'ar]] and powerful [[Homo superior|Mutant]]. [[Sharada Darthri (Earth-616)|Sharada Darthri]] experimented on the baby and infused it with [[Kree]] geneline.{{r|X-Men Vol 4 #18|20}} \n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = interstellar spacecraft\n| Weapons                 = directed energy weapons, genetically created hybrid soldiers (including super-powered ones)\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Alien Religions]]"
