The tribe has evolved into something of a cross between the mafia and a corporation.{{r|Inhuman #9}} The Ennilux were ruled by [[Capo (Earth-616)|The Capo]] until his death.{{r|Inhuman #2}}\n\nWhen their chief technology officer [[Marishi Spin (Earth-616)|Marishi Spin]] gathered the Ennilux together to elect their new C.E.O., he also planned to unveil a new piece of technology called the Antigen, an inhibitor of Inhuman abilities. However, the device was stolen by [[Fantomelle (Earth-616)|Fantomelle]] before the presentation.{{r|Uncanny Inhumans #5}}\n\nSpin eventually got the Antigen back just as Ennilux began the election to find a new C.E.O. to replace the Capo. The election was held in the [[Quiet Room]], a new establishment owned by the Inhuman king [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]]. [[Ahura Boltagon (Earth-616)|Ahura Boltagon]], heir to the Inhuman throne, ran in the election and won thanks to a speech he gave and from support from his father Black Bolt.{{r|Uncanny Inhumans #7}}\n| Equipment               = Ennilux possess uncanny devices and treasures in their vaults, including the plans of [[Archimedes (Earth-616)|Archimedes]]' death ray, and an unknown thing from [[Leonardo da Vinci (Earth-616)|da Vinci]].{{r|Uncanny Inhumans #12}}\n| Transportation          = [[Ennilux Airship|Enniluxian Attack Zeppelins]]\n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Inhuman Organizations]]"
