It's members consisted of [[Ghilaron (Earth-616)|Ghilaron]], [[Batragon (Earth-616)|Batragon]], [[Lepirax (Earth-616)|Lepirax]], and [[Centipor (Earth-616)|Centipor]]. Each of them had enough power to level a building. \n\nWhen Batragon was sent by Dr. Demonicus to retrieve and destroy an oil tanker, [[Godzilla (Earth-616)|Godzilla]] intervened and fought Batragon back to Dr. Demonicus's volcano lair and killed it. Being tracked down by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Dr. Demonicus deployed Ghilaron, Centipor, and Lepirax to combat the atomic dinosaur as he attempted to resist S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. \n\nHowever, this proved ineffective, as Godzilla successfully killed every member of the team as Dr. Demonicus was arrested and transported in a helicopter, planning revenge on Godzilla someday.{{r|Godzilla #4|5}}\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
