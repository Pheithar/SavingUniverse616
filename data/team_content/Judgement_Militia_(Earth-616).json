They felt it their duty to pass judgement on Canada's team of adventurers. The team staged a military strike on [[Department H (Toronto)|Department H Headquarters]] once they had confirmed Alpha Flight had departed.\tUnder cover of a pizza delivery, they took out security personnel, making their way to the medical lab where Manikin's cocoon was stored. When they attempted to kill Manikin, they were assaulted by [[Wyre (Earth-616)|Wyre]], who managed to disable or kill all of them; though Manikin was injured in the process.{{r|Alpha Flight Vol 1 119|120}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = A \"Pizza Xpress\" van\n| Weapons                 = Military-grade guns, knives, knockout gas.\n| Notes                   = * This name of this group was never formally given.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
