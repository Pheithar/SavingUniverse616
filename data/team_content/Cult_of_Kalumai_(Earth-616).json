Though most believed the Cult to have died out over the centuries, there were still a small number of dedicated members who sought out the painting which served as Kalumai's dimensional portal to Earth. This portal, however, was guarded by the protector known as the [[Straw Man (Earth-616)|Scarecrow]], whose sole purpose was to keep Kalumai from returning to Earth.\n\nGregor Rovik discovered that the painting was on sale at a New York art auction and attempted to purchase it. He was outbid by [[Jess Duncan (Earth-616)|Jess Duncan]]. The Cult of Kalumai, stormed into Duncan's home and stole the painting while kidnapping his girlfriend, Harmony Maxwell, who was to be used as a sacrifice in their ritual. The Cult went to their ritual site in an old barn, but before they could commence the ritual they were attacked by the Scarecrow, who single-handedly defeated the Cult members and grusomely killed Rovik before leaving again.{{r|Dead of Night #11}} The cult again tried to steal the painting through its servant [[Bartolome (Earth-616)|Bartolome]] and the Night Demons he commanded, but they were again defeated by the Scarecrow.{{r|Marvel Spotlight #26}}\n\n\n| Equipment               = Robes, masks\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Knives\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n\n[[Cult]]\n[[Category:Earth Religions]]"
