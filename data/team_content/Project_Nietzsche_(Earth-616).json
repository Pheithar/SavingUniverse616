They also hoped to use [[Homo mermanus]] DNA but the mission to retrieve it failed. Their attempts were met with varying success.{{r|Marvels Project #1}}\n\nDr. Erskine however defected to the [[United States of America]] with the help of [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]], taking his work with him.{{r|Marvels Project #2}} In the summer of 1941 his Jewish ancestry was discovered by the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] who ordered Schmitt to be taken to a concentration camp.{{r|Marvels Project #8}}\n\nImprisoned by the Nazis and dying, Schmitt asked [[Brian Falsworth (Earth-616)|Brian Falsworth]] to keep the sample of the formula he had concealed on his person from falling into Nazi hands. Falsworth took the disguised flask, drank its contents, and was immediately physically enhanced by the formula. Falsworth escaped the prison and became a costumed fighter of Nazis within Germany itself known as the Destroyer.{{r|Invaders Vol 1 18}}\n\nIn the states; Dr. Erskine developed the first \"Super-Soldier Serum\" as part of a top secret US Government experiment called '''[[Operation Rebirth|Operation: Rebirth]]'''. He was now code-named \"Professor Reinstein\" to hide his identity.{{r|Captain America Comics Vol 1 1}}\n\n[[Raymond Koch (Earth-616)|Dr. Raymond Koch]] later took over the project. He experimented on [[Jewish]] prisoners kept at the [[Schwarzebitte]] concentration camp during the [[Holocaust (Event)|Holocaust]]. In October 1942, [[Isaiah Bradley (Earth-616)|Isaiah Bradley]] performed his first mission as Captain America at the Schwarzebitte concentration camp. He discovered the horrors at the site killing Doctor Koch with his bare hands.{{r|Truth: Red, White & Black Vol 1 4}}\n\n[[File:Arnim_Zola_(Earth-616)_from_Captain_America_and_Bucky_Vol_1_622_001.jpg|thumb|left|Arnim Zola creating the \"Ubermensch\"]]\n[[Arnim Zola (Earth-616)|Dr. Arnim Zola]] kidnapped the allies team of heroes the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]] and used the the DNA of  [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]], [[Human Torch (Jim Hammond)]] and [[Thomas Raymond (Earth-616)|Toro]] to create his new super-soldier the [[Ubermensch (Earth-616)|Ubermensch]]. However [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky]] arrived to save his friends and was able to hold off the Ubermensch long enough to free his friends from their captivity and they destroyed Zola's experiments.{{r|Captain America and Bucky #622}}\n\n[[Wernher von Blitzschlag (Earth-616)|Wernher von Blitzschlag]] was also involved in the creation of the Nazi Super-Soldiers. [[Master Man (Wilhelm Lohmer)]] was subjected to the Nazi version of the Super-Soldier Serum. Although the formula was a derivative of the original Super-Soldier serum that gave Captain America his powers, Lohmer gained abilities exceeding those of Captain America.{{r|Giant-Size Invaders Vol 1 1}} He also tested on [[Julia Koenig (Earth-616)|Warrior Woman]]{{r|Dark Reign Files #1}} and [[Vunderknight (Earth-616)|Vunder Knight]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative Annual #1}}\n\nIn 1944, [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Dr. Nathaniel Essex ]] was working with the Nazi's to create and Ubermensch. He was on U-Boat when is was attacked  by Namor. He was able to retrieve a blood sample and created '''[[Experiment N2 (Earth-616)|Experiment N2]]''', a clone of Namor. He defeated the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]] but was ultimately taken out by Captain America.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 14}}\n| Equipment               = -\n* '''[[Super-Soldier Serum]]'''\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:German Organizations]]\n[[Category:Government Organizations]]\n[[Category:Axis Organizations]]\n[[Category:Super-Soldier Programs]]"
