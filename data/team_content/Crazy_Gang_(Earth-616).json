After giving the Crazy Gang life, Jaspers was murdered by the [[Fury (Earth-238)|Fury]], a creation of his late Earth-238 counterpart.  The Crazy Gang survived the Fury and wandered off.  They went on to become Britain's most inept supervillains.  They subsequently placed an advertisement in a newspaper in order to find a new leader and, as a result, the Crazy Gang entered the employ of [[Slaymaster (Earth-616)|Slaymaster]].  Under his leadership, the gang committed a series of audacious crimes, robbing the Royal Mint, the National Gallery, and the British Museum. As Slaymaster had planned, these crimes attracted the attention of [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]], who he captured. Having no further use for the Crazy Gang, Slaymaster dismissed them. \n\nThe Crazy Gang were later used by [[Arcade (Earth-616)|Arcade]] to kidnap [[Courtney Ross (Earth-616)|Courtney Ross]] in order to lure Captain Britain and his teammates in [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]] to [[Murderworld]].  Ross managed to fight off the Crazy Gang, but was captured by Arcade and his assistant [[Miss Locke (Earth-616)|Miss Locke]]. When Excalibur came to the rescue, the gang used a device created by [[Tweedledope (Earth-616)|Tweedledope]] to switch bodies with Excalibur - Captain Britain with Tweedledope, [[Meggan Puceanu (Earth-616)|Meggan Puceanu]] with the [[Knave (Crazy Gang) (Earth-616)|Knave]], [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] with the [[Jester IV (Earth-616)|Jester]], and [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Phoenix]] with the [[Executioner (Crazy Gang) (Earth-616)|Executioner]]. Only [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadowcat]] escaped. Captain Britain in Tweedledope's body managed to alter the device, and Shadowcat, with Ross' help, managed to reverse the body-swap, and Excalibur defeated the Crazy Gang. Both the Crazy Gang and Arcade were apprehended after Excalibur defeated them.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 4|5}}\n\nLater, the Crazy Gang was involved in the disappearance of the population of a small English village. When Excalibur investigated, they found the villagers, and the Crazy Gang, in a strange, Alice in Wonderland-style underground lair. As it turned out, however, the villagers had consented to accompanying the Crazy Gang, and Excalibur left them alone.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 54}}\n\n===Mercs for Money===\nAfter [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], and the [[Mercs for Money (Earth-616)|Mercs for Money]] stole a [[Rigellian Recorders|Rigellian Recorder]], they were attacked by the Crazy Gang who tried to steal the Recorder from them, the Mercs were able to fight them off, and escaped.{{r|Deadpool & the Mercs for Money Vol 1 1}} The Crazy Gang eventually found Deadpool again at the [[Ozarks Kingpin (Earth-616)|Ozarks Kingpin]] HQ, who had won the Recorder at an auction conducted by the Mercs. They got into a fight with the Mercs, and Ozarks Kingpin henchmen, after Deadpool shot Tweedledope, and apparently killing him, the Crazy Gang retreated from the fight.{{r|Deadpool & the Mercs for Money Vol 1 5}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = In Britain, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crazy_Gang The Crazy Gang] were a 1930's group of comedians, appearing in film and on stage.\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Marvel UK Characters]]\n[[Category:Jaspers Warp]]"
