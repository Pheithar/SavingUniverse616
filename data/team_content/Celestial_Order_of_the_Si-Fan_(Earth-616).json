A world-wide invisible empire, that was born in [[Asia]], and spread its tentacles to the four corners of the [[Earth]]. It had its fingers in both legitimate businesses and criminal enterprises, and its goal was global domination/conquest. Since the late 19th century, it had pledged its allegiance to [[Zheng Zu (Earth-616)|Fu Manchu]].{{r|Special Marvel Edition Vol 1 15}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 27}}{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 1 2}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 21}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 47}}{{r|Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 4}} \n\nSi-Fan has had bases in a wide variety of locations, including [[China]], [[South America]], the [[United States of America]], in [[Earth Orbit|Earth's orbit]], [[Africa]], and in the [[Arctic]] region. In addition to rank-n-file members of the Si-Fan, they have also had high-tech commandos,{{r|Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu #6}} assassins,{{r|Giant-Size Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 1}} martial arts masters, and [[Si-Fan Cyber-Ninja (Earth-616)|cybernetically-enhanced ninjas]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 63}} It possessed a globe-spanning army of highly-trained assassins. Compared to these masters of death, the professional killers of the underworld were novices.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 21}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 27}} The branches of the Si-Fan were organized as [[Triads (Earth-616)|Tongs]] (Lodges), each of which was headed by a Dragonhead or Shan Chu (Lodgemaster).{{r|Special Marvel Edition Vol 1 15}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 27}}{{r|Giant-Size Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 4}}\n| History                 = \nSince the day that Fu Manchu has led the Si-Fan, they have focused on one overriding goal in his service, global domination via mind control of political leaders, bringing about a global apocalypse, or simple terror. The first major operation involved controlling the minds of the representatives of the League of Nations in 1933.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 81}} After World War 2, Si-Fan kidnapped and brainwashed the UN representatives of the United States and China to get them to go to war with each other.{{r|Kung Fu Special Vol 1 1}} Afterwards, Si-Fan executed Fu Manchu's boldest operation ever, the attempt to knock the Moon out of its orbit to bring about natural disasters throughout the Earth.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 49|50}}\n\nUpon the return of Fu Manchu, who had been thought dead, the Si-Fan working with other secret societies kidnapped and brainwashed UN representatives and caused global panic using fake UFOs with genetically-engineered \"aliens\" with the goal of bringing about World War 3.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 86}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 89}} Si-Fan guards were present at Fu Manchu's fortress in China, when Shang-Chi assaulted the base to confront Fu Manchu but where unable to prevent its destruction or the apparent death of Fu Manchu.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 118}} Later they defended Shang-Chi's mother when she confronted him about letting Fu Manchu died and shamed him.{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 123}}\n\nYears later, Shang-Chi took temporary control of the Si-Fan and they agreed to stop being assassins until Fu Manchu returned.{{r|Master of Kung Fu: Bleeding Black Vol 1 1}} Upon the return of Fu Manchu, the Si-Fan were involved in the operation to use the Hellfire lightning weapon to destroy population centers and blackmail the world.{{r|Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu #6}} Whenever Fu-Manchu was thought dead, the Si-Fan or factions of it was led by his daughter [[Zheng Bao Yu (Earth-616)|Fah Lo Suee]], the crime boss [[Tiger-Claw (Earth-616)|Tiger-Claw]], the MI-6 agent [[Leiko Wu (Earth-616)|Leiko Wu]],{{citation}} and more recently the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]].{{r|X-Men Vol 2 63}}\n\nIt was later revealed by [[Zheng Shi-Hua (Earth-616)|Shi-Hua]] that the Si-Fan, along with the [[Order of the Golden Dawn (Earth-616)|Order of the Golden Dawn]] and [[Celestial Order of the Hai-Dai (Earth-616)|Order of the Hai-Dai]] were aliases used for the [[Five Weapons Society (Earth-616)|Five Weapons Society]], much like how Fu Manchu was an alias for Zheng Zu.{{r|Shang-Chi Vol 1 2}}\n| Equipment               = Cybernetics,{{r|{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 63}}-{{cl|X-Men Vol 2 64|64}}}} [[Electronic Feed Controls|mind control devices]],{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 84}} orbiting satellite,{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 86}}\n| Transportation          = [[Si-Fan Space Station|space station]],{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 50}} jetpacks,{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 47}} [[Fu Manchu's Spacecraft|space shuttle]],{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 50}} [[Si-Fan UFO|\"UFOs\"]](submersible aerial vehicles),{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 86}} submarine,{{r|Kung Fu Special Vol 1 1}} [[Si-Fan Flying Dragon|dragon airship]],{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 11}} [[Si-Fan Stealth Aircraft|stealth aircraft]],{{r|Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 3}}\n| Weapons                 = Nuclear weapons,{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 50}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 88|89}} chemical warfare agent,{{r|Marvel Knights Vol 1 4}} directed energy cannons,{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 49}} stealth bombers,{{r|Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 5|6}} lightning weapon,{{r|Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu #6}} giant mutated arthropods (e.g. [[spiders]], [[praying mantis]], [[scorpions]]),{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 116}}{{r|Master of Kung Fu Vol 1 118}} high-tech firearms (comparable to Hydra or S.H.I.E.L.D.),{{r|X-Men Vol 2 62|64}} mutated human-animal hybrids.{{r|Deadly Hands of Kung Fu Vol 1 4}}\n| Notes                   = * In Chinese culture, Tongs are the \"Lodges\" (Meeting Hall) and Shan Chu (aka, the Dragonhead) is the Lodgemaster.\n* It is unclear whether the [[Celestial Order of the Hai-Dai (Earth-616)|Celestial Order of the Hai-Dai]] is another name for the Celestial Order of the Si-Fan (to further distancing the modern [[Zheng Zu (Earth-616)|Zheng Zu]] from his [[Fu Manchu]] origin as non-Marvel-created content), or if they are an independent group.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Drug Cartels]]\n[[Category:Chinese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Triads]]\n[[Category:Five Weapons Society]]"
