Some of them claimed to be \"the deadliest, most highly-trained terrorist in the world\".\n\nAt some time, they were joined by the (secretly) powered [[Windstorm (Earth-616)|Windstorm]] who took the lead and they (six members, the whole movement) had the deaf son of an [[United States of America|American]] ambassador took as a hostage in a kibbutz, and a teacher killed. \n\nAs the [[Tsahal (Earth-616)|Israeli army]] had surrounded the kibbutz, the [[Mossad (Earth-616)|Mossad]] Super-Agent [[Ruth Bat-Seraph (Earth-616)|Sabra]] took command of the squad and ordered them to withdraw, to handle the affair by herself.\n\nThe five terrorists were easily defeated but Windstorm, who seemingly had plotted the hostage situation to confront Sabra, resisted, severely wounding the deaf boy.\n\nSabra eventually managed to take back his powers and life-energy from Windstorm, seemingly killing her in the process, and using that energy to heal the boy.\n\nWindstorm and her men all presumably dead or in custody, the movement was seemingly cleaned up.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Guns, rifles and [[Windstorm (Earth-616)|Windstorm]]'s powers\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
