And beyond the fallow years, It has been so for thousands of years''. What of [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|yours]]?\n| Speaker                 = [[Isca (Earth-616)|Isca the Unbeaten]]\n| QuoteSource             = X-Men Vol 5 16\n\n| History                 = \n\nThe Great Ring was formed in [[Amenth]] and had been ruling body of [[Arakko]] for thousands of years, with the exception of the period when Arakko was ruled by [[Annihilation (Earth-616)|Annihilation]]. The Great Ring follows three basic rules; 1) Make more mutants; 2) Destroy all enemies; 3) Defend Arakko.\n\nThe Great Ring was shaped by their peoples' need for structure during their constant times of war and battle. The Great Ring is composed exclusively of Omega-Level mutants. To this day, they believe in power most of all, an ideology that shapes Arakki society.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 16}} In order to gain a seat on the Ring, any Arakki mutant may challenge a sitting council member in the [[Circle Perilous]]. If they succeed, the winner will receive the loser's seat.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 8}}\n\n===X of Swords===\nFollowing [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Saturnyne]]'s [[X of Swords|Tournaments of Swords]] and battle in [[Otherworld]], the The Great Ring lost two of its members with [[Genesis (Earth-616)|Genesis]] staying in [[Amenth]] with her [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|husband]] and [[Redroot (Earth-616)|Redroot]], who was imprisoned by [[James Jaspers (Earth-616)|Mad Jim Jaspers]] as payment for breaking a priceless [[Crystal Idol of Bombu]].{{r|X of Swords: Destruction Vol 1 1}}{{r|X-Force Vol 6 14}}\n\n===Planet Arakko===\nThe Great Ring offered three of its members; [[Lactuca (Earth-616)|Lactuca]], [[Xilo (Earth-616)|Xilo]], and [[Sobunar (Earth-616)|Sobunar]], to aid the mutants of [[Krakoa]] in terraforming [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]] and moving Arakko there.{{r|Planet-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}}\n\n[[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] was named the Regent of Sol, and was given a seat on the Great Ring. During a meeting, [[Tarn (Locus Vile) (Earth-616)|Tarn]] expressed his interest in Krakoa, as a [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Krakoan mutant]] had stolen the genetic material of his [[Locus Vile (Earth-616)|Locus Vile]] and himself. The Great Ring forbade Tarn from attacking Krakoa, and Tarn agreed to abide by their decision, though he would break his promise shortly thereafter when the Locus Vile found the thieves.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 14}} Storm called another meeting and confronted Tarn for breaking his word. Tarn reiterated that he would not leave Krakoa alone until he was satisfied, prompting Storm to challenge him to a duel in the [[Circle Perilous]]. Tarn easily disarmed Storm, disabling her powers and mutating her grotesquely. Seemingly defeated, Storm managed to get close enough to pierce Tarn's chest with a dagger, threatening to kill him if he did not surrender. Tarn yielded, and restored Storm's abilities and appearance. {{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 8}}\n\n==Council Structure==\nThe Council itself is divided up into four sections of three seats along with an adjunct section:\n* Dawn is deferred to in times of war, and consists of:\n** [[Isca (Earth-616)|Isca the Unbeaten]], who sits on the Seat of Victory and is consulted when battle is won.\n** [[Idyll III (Earth-616)|Idyll the Future Seer]], who sits on the Seat of Stalemate and is consulted when there is no clear winner.\n** [[Tarn (Locus Vile) (Earth-616)|Tarn the Uncaring]], who sits on the Seat of Loss and is consulted when battles are lost.\nIdyll replaced her father [[High Mutant Prophet Idyll]] on the council,{{r|X-Men Vol 5 16}} and Isca took the place of her sister [[Genesis (Earth-616)|Genesis]].{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 8}}\n* Day is deferred to in times of peace, and consists of:\n** [[Lactuca (Earth-616)|Lactuca the Knower]], who sits on the Seat of Above-Us and is consulted on matters of the heavens.\n** [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|The Regent of Arakko]], who sits on the Seat of All-Around-Us and is consulted on matters of the land, the people, the weather, and the turn of the world.\n** [[Sobunar (Earth-616)|Sobunar of the Depths]], who sits on the Seat of Below-Us and is consulted on matters of the deep.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 16}}{{r|Planet-Size X-Men Vol 1 1}}{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 8}}\n* Dusk is '''never deferred to''', but is still consulted on the nation's more conceptual matters. The Table consists of:\n** [[Ora Serrata (Earth-616)|Ora Serrata the Witness]], who sits on the Seat of Law and is consulted on all legal matters.\n** [[Xilo (Earth-616)|Xilo, the First Defender]], who sits on the Seat of History and is consulted on matters of lore, recording (and deciding) Arakko's history.\n** [[Lodus Logos (Earth-616)|Lodus Logos]], who sits on the Seat of Dreams and is consulted on matters of art, poetry, and song.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 16}}{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 8}}\n* Night consists of hidden members of the The Great Ring with hidden purposes.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 16}}\n* Lastly, an adjunct to the council consisted of\u00a0Arakko and its speaker [[Redroot (Earth-616)|Redroot the Forest]], representing the interests and needs of the island itself.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 16}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Stulgid was originally shown to be the third member of the Table of Dusk, but this ended up being changed to Xilo's former name.{{r|S.W.O.R.D. Vol 2 8}} \n| Trivia                  = * The Great Ring of Arakko mirrors [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|the Quiet Council of Krakoa]], including similar laws, seating and table placement, and having a voice of their island.\n* Every member that has ever served and currently serves on The Great Ring of Arakko has been an '''Omega-Level''' mutant. One cannot be a member without being an '''Omega-Level''' mutant.\n* [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] is the only known individual to have seat on both the Quiet Council and the Great Ring along with [[Galactic Council (Earth-616)|the Galactic Council]] simultaneously.\n| Links                   = \n|Overview=The Great Ring of Arakko was the governing body of [[Arakko]].}}\n[[Category:Mutant Organizations]]"
