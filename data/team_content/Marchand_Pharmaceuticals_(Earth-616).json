Company resources were used in the studying and implementing the partial data belonging to Dr. [[Jonathan Drew (Earth-616)|Jonathan Drew]], in an attempt to cure [[Rebecca Marchand (Earth-616)|Rebecca Marchand]] of her cancer. While initially successful, the cure lasted only one year, thus Michael Marchand diverted resources towards the attempt to remove the radiation immunity of [[Jessica Drew (Earth-616)|Jessica Drew]], Spider-Woman. With that step completed, the company was then committed to studying her in the progress towards a cure for Rebecca's cancer.{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 7 1|2}}\n\nAfter the acquisition of a ''Latrodectus Aeternum'' spider, research resumed on a treatment. However, the company came under siege by an unknown group, and one of the company doctors, Stephen, held Rebecca hostage to get the spider and pay off his student loan debts. Once neutralized, Michael and Rebecca were exfiltrated by Jessica to the roof helipad to fly for safety to a company jet.{{r|Spider-Woman Vol 7 3}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:American Organizations]]\n[[Category:Companies]]"
