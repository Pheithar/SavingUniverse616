In a desperate effort to expunge their dark past, the symbiotes of Klyntar  perpetuated the lie that the natural state of their species was benevolence and that Klyntar was their homeworld.{{r|Venom Vol 4 4}} As an act of redemption, the Symbiotes symbiotes sought out worthy hosts from various species and established the Agents of the Cosmos, an organization of noble warriors capable of sensing the \"voice\" of the Cosmos and dedicated to maintaining peace across the universe.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 23}}{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 2}}\n\nUnfortunately, some symbiotes found themselves bonded to unworthy hosts, who used their partners for malevolent purposes and returned them to their original state as bloodthirsty predatory parasites.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 23}}{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 8}} These \"corrupted\" symbiotes were cut off from the Symbiotes hive-mind, but were capable of replicating themselves through asexual reproduction and resumed their former master's campaign of conquest; spreading what the Symbiotes declared false information in order to tarnish the reputation of their benevolent brethren.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 23}}\n\nIn response, the Symbiotes hive-mind developed a means of cleansing corrupted symbiotes by purging negative emotions and memories,{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 12}} although the procedure was difficult and occasionally did not work, leaving incompletely cleansed symbiotes in constant danger of relapse.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 7}}{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 10}} Agents of the Cosmos whose symbiotes are in danger of succumbing to corruption were taken back to Klyntar, where their symbiote would undergo trial to determine its fate. Symbiotes that failed the trial were deemed lost and executed without mercy, and if the host was still deemed worthy they would receive a new symbiote and return to their duties.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 7}}{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 10}}\n\nLoyalty to the Cosmos was valued above all, and Agents who rebelled or disputed the decisions of the elder members could find themselves placed on trial to determine their worthiness.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 10}} What happened to Agents who were deemed unworthy is unknown, but it was implied by [[Tarna (Earth-616)|Tarna]] that exile is a possible fate. The [[Space Knights (Earth-616)|Space Knights]], a rival organization, were condescending towards the Agents of the Cosmos for this practise.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 12}}\n\nAt some point following [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Agent Venom]] and [[Tarna (Earth-616)|Tarna]]'s departure, the Agents of the Cosmos were attacked and wiped out by the [[Poisons]],{{r|Venom Vol 1 163}} though some survivors may have managed to escape.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cullenbunn/status/984847178186346498|title=Cullen Bunn on Twitter: \"gammacortez said: Since the Agents of the Cosmos being \"wiped out\" happened off screen, would it bother...\"|work=Twitter|first=Cullen|last=Bunn|date=13 April 2018|accessdate=13 April 2018}}</ref>\n| Equipment               = All members of the Agents of the Cosmos are bonded to a [[Symbiotes|symbiote]] that acts as their partner as well as a suit of bioarmor.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Most Agents of the Cosmos rely on the shape-shifting abilities inherit to their symbiote to engage in melee combat.\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * When asked whether the Agents of the Cosmos were aware of [[Haze Mancer (Earth-616)|Haze Mancer]] poaching symbiotes, Cullen Bunn replied \"They must all be dead.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cullenbunn/status/967776564476809216|title=Cullen Bunn on Twitter: \"ascha-vovina said: I was reading Poison-X and a question occurred to me: Are the Agents of the Cosmos...\"|work=Twitter|first=Cullen|last=Bunn|date=25 February 2018|accessdate=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Interplanetary Organizations]]\n[[Category:Symbiotes]]\n[[Category:Symbiote-Enhanced Organizations]]"
