They include:\n\nA Colossus made of Stone\n\nA Wolverine made of Ice\n\nA Cyclops that shoots Lava\n\nAn Angel made of leaves and vines\n\nA Nightcrawler made of mud\n\nHowever, they are much weaker than the original X-men, and Nightcrawler easily defeats them all, before defeating Vega-superior himself.{{r|Excalibur Vol 1 #31}}\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
