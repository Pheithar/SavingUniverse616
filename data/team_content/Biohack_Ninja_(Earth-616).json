His inquest led Rhodes to be captured by a couple of them,{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 6}} who brought him to their leader.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 7}} With [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]'s assistance, Iron Man located War Machine and tried to save him. Unfortunately, the Techno Golem, having stripped Rhodes of his armor and using in on herself, did the same to Iron Man. She subsequently caused an explosion that left Stark for dead.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 8}}\n\n[[File:Southeast Asia Crime Syndicate (Earth-616) from Invincible Iron Man Vol 4 3 001.jpg|thumb|left|The Techno Golem and her Biohack Ninja]]\nHaving faked his death, Tony became a member of Osaka's underworld, under the alias of Richard Franco. After helping an ally of Tomoe named [[Yukio (Earth-616)|Yukio]] evade capture,{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 9}} \"Franco\" was invited into Tomoe's circle. Accompanied by several biohack ninja, Tomoe's right hand [[Zhang (Earth-616)|Zhang]] brought him to her. In order to prove his worth to Tomoe, \"Franco\" later had to fight some biohack ninja to a standstill.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 10}}\n\nWar Machine enlisted the help of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] in striking down Tomoe, having decied that Stark had spent too much time undercover. This event led to the arrest of many Biohack Ninja at the hands of [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], which forced Tomoe to lay low until she could return.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 3 11}}\n\nWith the appearance of a new hearo named [[Riri Williams (Earth-616)|Ironheart]] following Stark's fall, Tomoe decided to take her down, fearing her enterprise could be endgangered once again after its resurgence. Accompanied with numerous biohack ninja, Tomoe attacked Ironheart and [[Virginia Potts (Earth-616)|Rescue]] in [[Chicago (Illinois)|Chicago]] and stripped them of their armor.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 4 3}} Riri managed to slip away from the fight to get help while Pepper Potts held off Tomoe's ninja.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 4 4}} When Riri got Tomoe to absorb an armor taken to the scene by a [[Anthony Stark (Third A.I.) (Earth-616)|digital duplicate]] of Tony Stark, the Tony A.I. uploaded a virus in her systems that knocked her down. The backlash caused by the virus also shorted out the systems in the suits of the ninja, knocking them out. They were later apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. together with their leader.{{r|Invincible Iron Man Vol 4 5}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Southeast Asia Crime Syndicate (Earth-616)/Members]]"
