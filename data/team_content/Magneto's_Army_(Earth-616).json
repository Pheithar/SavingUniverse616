Afterwards, they created a real army, modeling their uniforms after the ones Mastermind used for his illusions. {{r|X-Men Vol 1 4}}\n\nThe Army enforced a curfew in the streets of Santo Marco, causing the scared citizens to remain in their homes. They also arrested anyone resisting Magneto's reign. However, they had orders to allow American visitors to freely enter the country. So they allowed [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]] and the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] to enter the country, after merely checking the Professor's passport. {{r|X-Men Vol 1 4}}\n| Equipment               = Various\n| Transportation          = Various\n| Weapons                 = Various\n| Notes                   = \n*The Emblem of the Army was simply a capital letter \"M\", which stood for Magneto. {{r|X-Men Vol 1 4}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
