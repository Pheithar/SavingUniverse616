Developing a suit of armor that rendered him invisible to Uatu's gaze and procuring the android [[Draconus (Earth-616)|Dragon Man]], Aron sought to obtain the DNA samples of the Fantastic Four. {{R|Fantastic Four #321}} With the help of the [[Frightful Four (Earth-616)|Frightful Four]], Aron succeeded in his task. He then created [[Fantastic Four (Clones) (Earth-616)|clones]] of the existing members of the Fantastic Four, [[Reed Richards (Clone) (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]], the [[Susan Storm (Clone) (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]], the [[Jonathan Storm (Clone) (Earth-616)|Human Torch]], the [[Benjamin Grimm (Clone) (Earth-616)|Thing]], and [[Sharon Ventura (Clone) (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]]. {{r|Fantastic Four #328}}\n\nWith the real Fantastic Four put in suspended animation so he could watch their dreams, Aron sent the clones out into the world to take their place. Their first order of business was to recreate the first battle against the Fantastic Four's oldest foe, the [[Harvey Elder (Earth-616)|Mole Man]]. Raising the previously sunken [[Monster Island]] from the ocean floor, the cloned Fantastic Four attacked the Mole Man and his minions. After defeating their foes, the clones fled the island after setting off a massive explosion. {{r|Fantastic Four #329}} Seeking to recreate the Fantastic Four's encounter with the [[Joshua Ayers (Earth-616)|Miracle Man]], the clones later attacked an innocent magician during a stage performance and exposed how he performed his magic tricks to an increasingly hostile crowd. Feeling under appreciated for their \"efforts\", the clone of Mister Fantastic suggested that they begin charging a \"Fantasti-Tax\" in order to pay for their services. {{r|Fantastic Four #331}} \n\nEventually the activities of the clones attracted the attention of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] who came to believe that some outside force had changed the real Fantastic Four's personalities. However before the fight could get out of hand, the clones all found themselves teleported back to Aron's hideout in the Rocky Mountains. There they discovered that the Fantastic Four and Frightful Four had broken free and were battling it out, while Aron himself was trapped in suspended animation. The Fantastic Four and their clones battled it out with one another until the real Fantastic Four defeated them. Freeing himself from suspended animation, Aron came to the conclusion that experiencing the dreams of others was more fascinating than their real life exploits, he sent the Frightful Four to the [[Vault (Prison)|Vault]], the real Fantastic Four home, and spirited off to manipulate the dreams of his clones. {{r|Fantastic Four #333}} \n\nAlthough Aron has appeared since, there has been no word on the final fate of his clones.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
