The eight superpowered beings who can wield those hammers are granted immense magical power, and possessed by the evil spirits that are associated with the Serpent. [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)|Sin]] was the first one to lift the Hammer of Skadi, which transformed her into [[Sinthea Shmidt (Earth-616)#Fear Itself|Skadi]], who then freed the Serpent from his magical prison. He then sent seven more hammers to Earth, which were found and lifted by seven more people:\n\n* [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] became [[Kuurth (Earth-616)|Kuurth: Breaker of Stone]]\n* [[Attuma (Earth-616)|Attuma]] became [[Nerkkod (Earth-616)|Nerkkod: Breaker of Oceans]]\n* [[Mary MacPherran (Earth-616)|Titania]] became [[Skirn (Earth-616)|Skirn: Breaker of Men]]\n* [[Paul Duval (Earth-616)|Grey Gargoyle]] became [[Mokk (Earth-616)|Mokk: Breaker of Faith]]\n* [[Carl Creel (Earth-616)|Absorbing Man]] became [[Greithoth (Earth-616)|Greithoth: Breaker of Wills]]\n* [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|The Thing]] became [[Angrir (Earth-616)|Angrir: Breaker of Souls]]\n* [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] became [[Nul (Earth-616)|Nul: Breaker of Worlds]]\n\nEvery one of the Worthy helped the Serpent to spread fear around the Earth. The first Worthy to be dispossessed was the Thing, with the help of [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]] and his reality alteration powers. After the final battle when the Worthy were defeated by [[Mighty (Earth-616)|The Mighty]] and the Serpent killed by [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], their hammers were taken away from them by [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]]. Nul was the only one who seemed to be still free on Earth, for that, Hulk searched for the help of [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]].\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = The [[Hammer of Angrir]], [[Hammer of Nerkkod]], [[Hammer of Skadi]], and [[Hammer of Nul]] have been seen allowing their wielders to fly.\n| Weapons                 = [[Hammer of Skadi]], [[Hammer of Kuurth]], [[Hammer of Nul]], [[Hammer of Nerkkod]], [[Hammer of Skirn]], [[Hammer of Mokk]], [[Hammer of Greithoth]], [[Hammer of Angrir]]. \n\n\n| Notes                   = * [[Tarene (Earth-616)|Tarene]] was thought by many to be one of the Worthy, because of her being a Hammer-wielder hero.{{r|Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt Vol 1 #1|#6}}\n| Trivia                  = \n* The way in which the arrival of the hammers on Earth is portrayed seems similar to a scene from the film ''[[Wikipedia:Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'', in which the Fallen and other Decepticons crash-land on Earth in several different locations. \n* The Worthy each being able to wield a specific hammer of their own is similar to Thor being worthy to wield [[Mjolnir]], except that their handles are long while Thor's is short.\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Fear Itself]]\n[[Category:Asgardian Organizations]]"
