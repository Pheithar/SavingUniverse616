They appear in canine form but shapeshift into humanoid form to attack. They also have heightened telepathic senses that allow them to track their targets, and are able to phase through objects.{{Citation}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = http://www.romspaceknightart.blogspot.com/\n}}"
