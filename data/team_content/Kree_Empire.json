The meeting went disastrously and the long and bitter [[Kree-Skrull War|war]] started between the two races. The Kree eventually spread throughout the galaxy, establishing a vast empire.{{r|Avengers #133|134}}<!-- to be developed, expanded -->\n\nWithin a hundred years of acquiring interstellar technology from the Skrulls, the Kree empire began to spread throughout the [[Large Magellanic Cloud|Greater Magellanic Cloud]].{{r|Avengers #133}}\n\n===[[Kree-Skrull War]]===\n{{MessageBox\n| Message = For the full presentation of this event, please consult the '''[[Kree-Skrull War]]''' page.\n}}\nThe Kree launched an attack upon the [[Skrull Empire]] and the peaceful Skrulls were forced to return to their warlike tendencies to defend themselves. The [[Kree-Skrull War]] continued for hundreds of thousands of years.{{r|Avengers #133}}\n\nAt the same time, the [[Cotati]] on Hala were almost driven to extinction by the Kree. However, a small handful of Kree, the pacifist [[Priests of Pama (Earth-616)|Priests of Pama]], hid and kept safe a group of Cotati. Eventually these Kree began worshiping the Cotati that they had kept sheltered. To further hide and keep them safe, the priests relocated the surviving Cotati throughout the universe.{{r|Avengers #134}}\n\nAbout 250 years later, the [[Kree Science Council (Earth-616)|Kree Science Council]], aware that the Skrulls had once created an incredibly powerful weapon called the [[Cosmic Cube]], designed a cybernetic/organic supercomputer called the [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]] (sometimes referred to by the honorific \"Supremor\") to help them in creating a Cube. When the computer became functional, it determined that a Cosmic Cube would be too dangerous to construct and refused the Science Council's request. The computer was then used simply in an advisory capacity.{{citation}}\n\nOver time, and as the war with the Skrull dragged on, the Supreme Intelligence gradually accrued more and more political power and responsibility until finally it was elected as absolute ruler of the Kree. Eventually, the Supreme Intelligence came to be worshiped and an organized religion built up around.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 7}}\n\n===Activities in prehistoric Earth's solar system<!-- not a fan, but the whole thing need rewriting and expansion -->===\nThe Kree Empire attempted an invasion of [[Earth]] about 66 million years ago, but were repelled by a ''[[Starbrand (Dinosaur) (Earth-616)|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' imbued with the power of the [[Star Brand (Object)|Starbrand]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 26}} ''That event presumably happens via time travel,''{{r|Empyre Handbook #1|; [[Kree]]'s profile }}'' as the Kree began their space-faring activities only about a million years ago.''\n\nThe Kree established a station on the planet [[Uranus (Planet)|Uranus]], a strategic position between the Kree and Skrull Empires. Through their work at this station, they discovered that sentient life on nearby Earth had genetic potential, invested in it by the alien Celestials. Intrigued, the Kree began to experiment on Earth's pre-humans.{{r|What If? #28}}\n\n====Experimenting on Earthlings====\n[[File: Homo antecessor from Fantastic Four Vol 1 577 0001.png|right|thumb]]\nThe Kree, after earlier having been vivisecting the Eternal [[Arlok (Earth-616)|Arlok]] (found in space after the destruction of Ouranos' spaceship), found out the Celestials' experiments on terrans.{{r|What If #28}}\n\nThe Kree experimented on ''[[Homo antecessor]]'', leading the way to the Inhumans.{{r|Fantastic Four #577}}\n\n====The Inhumans' Creation====\n{{MessageBox\n| Message = For the full presentation of this race, please consult the '''[[Inhuman History]]''' page.\n}}\nAround 25.000 years ago,{{r|Inhumanity #1}} The Kree travelled to [[Earth]] to investigate possible ways of circumventing their own evolutionary stagnation, and to create a powerful race of soldiers for use against the Skrulls. The Kree (along with a [[Kree Sentries|Sentry]]) came to a tribe of [[Neanderthals]] and experimented on them,{{r|What If? #28}} because of their genetic potential for manipulation,{{r|What If? #28}}{{r|Fantastic Four #577}} which was discovered due to the Kree dissecting [[Arlok (Earth-616)|Arlok]], a fallen-in-combat [[Eternals (Race)|Eternal]], and finding out the [[Celestials]]' experiments on the early humans.{{r|What If? #28}}\n\nThose Kree experiments lasted for twenty-five years, and led to the creations of an offshoot eventually known as the [[Inhumans (Race)|Inhumans]];{{r|What If #28}} their divergence from humanity occurring twenty-five thousand years ago. However, although their experiments were successful in creating a strain of humanity with extraordinary and diverse abilities, the Kree abandoned their experiment for reasons which are not yet clear.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 6}}\n\nThe Kree abandoned the project eventually, but stationed a giant surveillance robot, [[Sentry 459 (Earth-616)|Sentry 459]], on a small South Pacific island.{{r|Fantastic Four #64}}\n\n===Kree dormant evolution===\nAt some point, allegedly due to a Kree trying to acquire the [[Crystal of Ultimate Vision]] without denying the temptation of its powers,{{r|X-Men Annual Vol 1 11}} Kree evolution became dormant.{{r|Royals #5}}\n\n===4th century BC===\nAlong with other [[Kree Eternals]], [[Ard-Con (Earth-616)|Ard-Con]] journeyed through space and traveled to [[Earth]] 4000 years ago. After being mistaken for [[Tuatha de Danaan|Gods]] by the [[Celts]], all Kree Eternals soon left, save for Ard-Con who lived there for a millennium, but was soon imprisoned by [[Tantalus (Deviant) (Earth-616)|Tantalus]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #5}}\n\n===2nd century BC===\nIn 200 B.C. A great Greek inventor, [[Archimedes (Earth-616)|Archimedes]] utilized his intellect to build the Colossus of Rhodes, a massive mechanical construct with which he defended Rhodes against a [[Kree Sentries|Kree Sentry]], defeating the Sentry, but at the cost of the [[Colossus of Rhodes]].{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D.: Infinity #1}}\n\n===Modern Era===\nThe [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]]'s unwary awakening of the long-dormant Sentry, alerted the Kree to Earth's advanced state of evolution. The Sentry's destruction brought the Kree official [[Ronan (Earth-616)|Ronan the Accuser]], with the intent of passing judgment on those who \"murdered\" the outpost guard; his own defeat increased Kree scrutiny of Earth.{{r|Fantastic Four #64|65}}\n\nThe Supreme Intelligence sent a group of soldiers on a secret mission to Earth commanded [[Yon-Rogg (Earth-616)|Yon-Rogg]]. [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Mar-Vell]] was sent undercover to infiltrate human society. He took the identity of [[Walter Lawson (Earth-616)|Dr. Walter Lawson]] a recently deceased [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Earth-616)|N.A.S.A.]] scientist. Yon-Rogg was jealous of Mar-Vell and [[Una (Earth-616)|Una]] and tried to kill him while on Earth.{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes #12}}\n\nAn [[Aakon]] force battled a Kree contingent led by [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Yon-Rogg (Earth-616)|Yon-Rogg]] on the dark side of the [[Moon]]. Both sides suffered losses and the Aakon escaped.{{r|Captain Marvel #8|9}}\n\nThe Earth's importance as a strategic beachhead became apparent when the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] became involved in the latest round of Kree-Skrull hostilities. The Skrull were revealed to have been infiltrating human society in an effort to control [[United States of America|America]]'s political infrastructure, using their shape-shifting abilities to replace key political figures. In the meantime, the Kree were reestablishing cultural ties with the Inhumans, ostensibly for the purpose of technological exchange, although their true intentions turned out to be far more sinister.\n\nAt this point, [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], former hero of the [[Kree Empire]], approached the Avengers with evidence that renegade elements within the Kree Hierarchy (led by Ronan the Accuser) were planning to 'erase' humanity through the use of exotic technology. This particular scheme was foiled by Marvel and the Avengers (comprised, at that time, of [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Goliath]], [[Pietro Maximoff (Earth-616)|Quicksilver]], the [[Wanda Maximoff (Earth-616)|Scarlet Witch]], the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]], [[Henry Pym (Earth-616)|Yellowjacket]], the [[Janet Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]], and eternal side-kick [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]]) but it proved to be only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAs the war escalated and Earth's position became increasingly precarious, the original Avengers (including [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]], [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] and [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]]) were recalled to active service after a Skrull scouting party (led by interstellar menace the [[Kl'rt (Earth-616)|Super-Skrull]]) managed to abduct Marvel, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. The Skrull also attempted to destroy the Inhumans' Great Refuge with a nuclear-level incendiary device, but failed when the Avengers intervened. This was the group's first inkling that an interplanetary war was being fought over possession of the Earth. During the ensuing conflict, the Skrull took his prisoners back to the Skrull homeworld, leaving the remaining Avengers to pick up the pieces and reform their tattered forces.\n\nThe conflict worsened when the Avengers began to understand the scale of the war erupting all around them. Setting off in pursuit of their kidnapped allies, they discovered a vast 'Skrull' armada en route to devastate the planet Earth; an equivalent Kree fleet poised to annihilate the Skrulls; and a full-scale insurrection breaking out between the Supreme Intelligence and Ronan the Accuser. All sides were determined to either invade or decimate the Earth in order to prevent it falling into the 'wrong' hands. Led by Thor, Iron Man and the Vision, the Avengers launched an attack on the Skrull flagship, somehow managing to turn back the fleet after a desperate battle (during which Goliath was deemed to be MIA and presumed dead).\n\nThe war came to a close when the Supreme Intelligence managed to bring Rick Jones into his presence. The Supreme Intelligence had been usurped by Ronan the Accuser, but (as he explained to Rick in retrospect), he was still capable of channelling his powers through an agent. While the Supreme Intelligence cared little for the fate of Earth and its inhabitants, he recognized that the Kree-Skrull war was futile, and temporarily altered Rick's DNA to release his 'full evolutionary potential.' Armed with godlike powers, Rick literally froze both Kree and Skrull forces in mid-stride, allowing the Supreme Intelligence to re-establish control over his people and bring the war to a halt. The effort proved too much for Rick's fragile human physiology; as he collapsed lifeless to the floor, the Supreme Intelligence teleported the  remaining Avengers to his side to witness his grim sacrifice. The irony was not lost on the assembled heroes, who reflected that a frail teenaged boy had succeeded where all of their collective might had failed. The final act in the cosmic tragedy was played out by Captain Marvel, who - understanding the debt owed by all of them - agreed to merge his life-force with Rick's body, bringing the boy back from the brink of death at the cost of his own existence.{{r|Avengers #89|97}}\n\n===New Kree-Skrull War===\nAt several points in the years after the end of the first Kree-Skrull War hostilities were said to have broken out again between the two empires. It is unclear how serious these conflicts were though they were often referred to as \"wars\".{{citation}} The most significant of these instances came when the Skrulls lost their ability to shapeshift, and a Skrull Warlord provoked new hostilities. During this war, the Supreme Intelligence was incapacitated by the [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] who removed the [[Soul Stone|Soul Gem]] which the creature used to maintain peaceful balance between its blue and pink Kree components. Afterwards, [[Nenora (Earth-616)|Nenora]], a Skrull spy in the guise of a high ranking Kree official, took command of the Kree empire. The war ended with Nenora being exposed as a Skrull. Leadership of the Kree was assumed for a time by an alien named [[Clumsy Foulup (Earth-616)|Clumsy Foulup]].{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 3 31}} Another significant conflict arose during the [[Infinity Gauntlet (Event)|Infinity Gauntlet]] event when the machinations of [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] led to the sudden elimination of half the universes lifeforms. Unaware of Thanos' role in the disappearance, the Kree and the Skrull blamed each other and temporarily renewed fighting.{{r|Infinity Gauntlet #2}}\n\n===[[Kree-Shi'ar War]]===\nNot long after the conflicts with the Skrull ended, the Kree again found themselves embroiled in a war, this time with the [[Shi'ar Empire]]. This war was much shorter, and was engineered by the Skrull and the Supreme Intelligence.{{r|Avengers #347}} The Avengers of Earth became involved in the conflict and their involvement (primarily between the Vision and Wonder Man) inadvertently set off a chain of events which led to a Nega-Bomb being detonated in Kree space. The bomb explosion, in which negative energy was released into space causing an extremely powerful explosive and radioactive reaction, devastating the Kree empire and killing ninety eight percent of the entire Kree population. This act of extreme genocide led to the Kree's surrender to the [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]]. The Supreme Intelligence was eventually revealed as being ultimately responsible for the bomb's detonation, the whole thing being a bid to kickstart the Kree race's genetic development.{{r|Imperial Guard Vol 1 3}}\n\nA Kree territory was then annexed by the Shi'ar, with Majestrix [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Lilandra]] naming her sister [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]] as the territory's administrator.{{r|Avengers #347}} Deathbird has since abandoned this post and it appears that the Kree Empire has, at least in some part, been re-established as they again had larger numbers and a feared Army.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 3|4}}\n\n===[[Ruul]] and Return of the Empire===\nThe remaining Kree were evolved into the Ruul through the machinations of the Supreme Intelligence.{{r|Maximum Security #1|3}}{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 4 #24|25}}\n\nThe Kree have since returned to their prior form.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 3|4}} The general consensus, explained by [[Elysius (Earth-616)|Elysius]] is that when [[Genis-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] convinced [[Entropy (Earth-616)|Entropy]] (son of [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]]) to destroy the universe, but then to recreate it almost exactly alike albeit with Entropy having become Eternity, it caused some 'discrepancies' (such as [[Elysius (Earth-616)|Genis-Vell's mother]] being still alive, and having a grownup [[Phyla-Vell (Earth-616)|daughter]]) and that some of these 'discrepancies' seemingly rippled back across time and showed up before the reconstruction of the universe, including the Kree again being an influential Empire and no longer appearing as the Ruul.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 18}}\n\n===Destruction of Hala===\nWith the resurgence of the [[Black Vortex]], a powerful item capable of unleashing the cosmic potential of whoever used it, the Kree attempted to destroy it. The Supreme Intelligence sent Ronan and the [[Accuser Corps (Earth-616)|Accuser Corps]] to take it from their current possessors, the cosmically enhanced [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]], [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|Beast]], and [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Angel]].{{r|All-New X-Men #38}}\n\nIn retaliation, the three cosmically-enhanced beings assaulted Hala.{{r|All-New X-Men #39}} The Accuser Corps tried to fight off their attackers, but were notably overpowered. After being denied by the Supreme Intelligence to use the power of the Black Vortex to fight back, Ronan the Accuser disobeyed him, and submitted to its power, ensuring a successful defense for the Kree homeworld, and forcing Gamora, Beast, and Angel to flee after the latter was knocked down.{{r|Guardians Team-Up #3}}\n\nOnce the dust settled, the Kree attempted to get rid of the Black Vortex once more. However, they were attacked by [[J'son (Earth-616)|Mister Knife]] and the [[Slaughter Lords (Earth-616)|Slaughter Lords]], another party interested in the Vortex. Taking advantage of the state of frailty in which Hala was left, he used all the firepower of his flying fortress to destroy the planet. The Supreme Intelligence demanded his Accuser Corps to escape, while he remained in Hala and perished.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 25}}\n\n===Potential Resurgence===\nRemnants of the now-broken empire enacted their own plans for rebuilding, as well as seeking retribution for what had been down to the throneworld.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 4 2}}{{r|Starbrand & Nightmask Vol 1 2}}{{r|Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Vol 1 10|12}}\n\nThanks to the power of a cosmic artifact known as the [[Black Vortex]]; Ronan, one of the last living Accusers, was last seen alive within the decimated remains of the destroyed Kree home planet, wallowing in bitterness and despair over the destruction of his protectorate charge.{{r|Royals Vol 1 3}} He beset the [[Royal Inhuman Diplomatic Mission (Earth-616)|royal envoy of Inhuman spacefarers]] led by [[Noh-Varr (Earth-200080)|Marvel Boy]], who sought to reinvigorate the empire via a [[Plex]] Intelligence seedling while on their jaunt through the cosmos.{{r|Royals Vol 1 4|5}}\n\nRonan still bore inherent resentments of [[Crystalia Amaquelin (Earth-616)|Crystal]] and the Royal family due to having left the dominion, more importantly; of her having left him behind.{{r|Royals Vol 1 4}} \n\nBut after they all had escaped his judgement, placated by cosmically simulated Pocket Battlefield techniques, Noh-Varr initiated a Supremor regenesis via implementing a seedling of his old Plex command module in an attempt to revitalize the Kree Empire as a pacifistic enterprise instead of it's warmongering predecessor.{{r|Royals Vol 1 6}} \n\n===Kree Civil War===\nAn outlier of Kree explorers returned to the remains of their shattered realm, horrified to learn that a band of Brigands led by a disgraced king turned criminal mastermind had destroyed it. Masterminding an ultimate plan to revitalize their shattered fiefdom, these remnants disposed Ronan and subjected him to inhumane cybernetics experimentation; rechristening themselves as the [[Kree Imperium]].{{r|Death of Inhumans Vol 1 2}} \n\nThey deployed a monstrous super-inhuman carrying all the powers of its adjacent race by the name of [[Vox (Super-Inhumans) (Earth-616)|Vox]] to attack and slaughter any and all Inhumans across the galaxy who would not join their cause willingly.{{r|Death of Inhumans Vol 1 1}}\n\nAs Black Bolt refused to aid these loathsome individuals who committed atrocities against his subjects in preparation for war against Earth and its Inhuman Population. Vox had the Inhuman King crippled by slitting his throat.{{r|Death of Inhumans Vol 1 2}} But the Midnight King would escape his confines and slaughter his would be slave master while giving the desecrated Ronan an honorable end with his voice. Blackagar would find rescue at the hand of his family with aid from Lockjaw's friend; [[Beta Ray Bill (Earth-616)|Beta Ray Bill]].{{r|Death of Inhumans Vol 1 3}} \n\nThe lot are horrified to discover that there is no super-inhuman, but a whole enclave of bionically modified inhumans enslaved by the heretical Imperium to do their bidding.{{r|Death of Inhumans Vol 1 4}} \n\nThe Inhuman royal family set out to do final battle with their tormentors only to be met by a brainwashed Crystal & Lockjaw. Black Bolt used the last of his energy to decimate the Inhuman army, putting an end to the Kree Imperium's threat.{{r|Death of Inhumans Vol 1 5}}\n\nAs the [[Kree Civil War|civil war]] raged on, the two factions eventually established a ceasefire by the Imperium's [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|leader, Emperor Dorrek VIII]]. The civil war had disastrous effects on the Kree Empire as they were no longer an empire, and so rebranded themselves as the Utopian Kree.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 1}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Law===\n{{Main|Kree Law}}\n===[[Kree Religions|Religions]]===\n====[[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]]====\nAs the Kree prized science and rational thought, they created a living God to those ideals: the [[Supreme Intelligence (Earth-616)|Supreme Intelligence]].{{r|X-Men Unlimited #5}} The worship of that creature was made the Kree official state religion.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 7}}\n\nThe afterlife of the Kree is the [[Etherplex]].{{r|Chaos War: Dead Avengers #1}}\n\n====Others====\nAn Kree Army officer and his crew once prayed to the \"[[Gods of Pama]]\". The prayer ended this way: ''\"...and consign you to the gods of Pama, for your having died valiantly in battle... a death that the Kree appreciate above anything else. So say we all\"''.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 5 3}}\n\n[[Korath-Thak (Earth-616)|Korath the Pursuer]] once made an omen to [[Gardar (Earth-616)|Gardar]],{{r|Annihilation: Ronan #3}} possibly a Kree god.\n\nA [[Followers of Tam-Bor (Earth-616)|group of Kree]] also worshiped a being known as [[Tam-Bor]],{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 15|16}} and Mar-Vell had also invoked his name.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 44}}\n\nThe ex-prime minister [[Zarek (Earth-616)|Zarek]] posed as a god-like being named Zo in order to seize control over the empire.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 15|16}}\n\nThe government allowed the [[Universal Church of Truth (Earth-616)|Universal Church of Truth]] to erect temples throughout the Kree Empire, including on [[Kree-Lar (Planet)|Kree-Lar]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 7}}\n\nSome Kree also gathered into secret sects of [[Cotati]] worshipers.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 7}}\n\nThe creators of the Kree, the [[Progenitors]], have been called gods of the Kree,{{r|Royals #5}}{{r|Royals #6}} in the same way that the Kree have been called gods to the [[Inhomo supremis|Inhumans]].{{r|Royals #5}}\n\n[[Sim-Del (Earth-616)|Sim-Del]], a Kree scientist, had researched and studied a God of Light who was able light an entire galaxy.{{r|Web of Venom: Wraith Vol 1 1}}\n\nOn [[Earth-1610]], the Kree worshiped the being known as Hala, who was also the alleged ancestor of [[Mahr Vehl (Earth-1610)|Mahr Vehl]].{{r|Ultimate Secret Vol 1 4}}\n\nIn the [[Cancerverse]], just like the majority of the beings, the Kree also worshiped the [[Many-Angled Ones]] following their takeover of the universe.{{r|Annihilation - Scourge: Silver Surfer Vol 1 1}}\n\n====Atheism====\nOn [[Earth-200080]], the Kree were seemingly atheists, learning in their early childhood a mathematical equation proving the nonexistence of any deities.{{r|Dark Reign: The List - Wolverine #1}}\n\n===Languages===\nThe Kree language exist in different versions, including at least '''ancient Imperial Kree'''{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy: Telltale Games Vol 1 1}} and [[Kreevian]].{{r|Avengers Vol 3 7}}\n\n*''Please find here our [[Kree Dictionary]].''\n\n===Arts===\nThe Kree had an Era of Symbolism in their history of theatre.{{r|Star-Lord #8}}\n\n===Money===\nThe Kree used as currency the kredits,{{r|Captain Marvel #11}} or credits.{{r|Iron Man #279}}\n\n==Technology==\nThe Kree possess technologies common to most alien races, including:\n{{Navigation\n| title = \n| body  = \n*'''Intergalactic Warp-Capable Starships:''' Able to travel from the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] to the [[Milky Way]] within seconds or minutes, near instantaneously via subspace.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 1 30}}\n* '''[[Kree Sentries]]:''' giant robotic sentries created to protect Kree interests on far off planets.{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 1 64}}\n* '''[[Kree Militia Uniforms]]''' are advanced suits worn [[Kree]] military.
