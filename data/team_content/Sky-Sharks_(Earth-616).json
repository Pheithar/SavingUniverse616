They were led by [[Lee Bradford (Earth-616)|Captain Lee Bradford]] whose exploits earned him the nickname \"Captain Daring\". \n\nIn their only recorded wartime adventure, the Sky-Sharks were told to stay in London while Captain Daring and fellow Sky-Shark [[Zeke Mallon (Earth-616)|Zeke Mallon]] participated in a prisoner exchange, trading [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi]] agent Marshall von Hapz for the captured Colonel Welling. Arriving in Berlin, Daring and Mallon were betrayed and taken prisoner. However, with the aid of double agent Lieutenant Raeger, they managed to escape with Colonel Welling. \n\nPinned down by a Nazi Gatling Gun squad at a German airfield, they were rescued by the timely arrival of the other Sky-Sharks who eliminated the Nazis and helped their comrades escape.{{r|U.S.A.
