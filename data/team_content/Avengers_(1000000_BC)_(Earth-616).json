Realizing the danger that beings like her posed to the Earth, she began assembling a team of supernatural and mystically-augmented individuals to protect the nascent humanity from both outside threats and itself; recruiting the [[Asgardian]] god [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin Borson]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 39}} Together, Firehair and Odin recruited the demigod sorcerer [[Agamotto (Earth-616)|Agamotto]], the [[Black Panther (1,000,000 BC) (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] of the [[Panther Tribe (Earth-616)|Panther Tribe]], the [[Spirits of Vengeance (Earth-616)|demonically]]-empowered [[Ghost Rider (1,000,000 BC) (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]], [[Fan Fei (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], and [[Vnn (Earth-616)|Starbrand]].{{r|Avengers Vol 8 1}}\n\n===The Fallen and the First Celestial Host===\n\nWhen a deranged [[Celestials|Celestial]] called [[Zgreb (Earth-616)|Zgreb the Sorrower]] attempted to tear the [[Earth]] apart, the Avengers were successfully able to subdue it. While Odin wanted to nail the fallen Celestial to the [[Luna (Moon)|Moon]] as warning to the others that would come, the team buried the cosmic giant under the plains of what would become the modern-day country of [[South Africa]] instead.{{r|Marvel Legacy Vol 1 1}} Soon afterwards, the [[Glossary:First Host|First Celestial Host]] - drawn by the battle against their fallen brethren - arrived on Earth, and the Avengers engaged them in combat but were defeated.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 1}} \n\n===Temporal Incursions===\nOver the years, the Avengers also fought against numerous [[Glossary:Time Travel|time travellers]] seeking to reshape history to their benefit, initially coming into conflict with a time-displaced [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]. While [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] attempted to seduce and torment Tony into selling his soul, the Avengers stood by and watched, obligated not to intervene with their enemy's scheme.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 28}}\n\n===A Devil\u2019s Schemes===\nAt some point, Mephisto approached a young [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] and convinced him to travel to [[Earth]] to challenge the Avengers in order to prove his might.{{r|Avengers Vol 8 38}}\n\n===Legacy===\n\nMillennia later, Odin's son [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] would follow in his father's footsteps and become the leader of a new team of [[Avengers (1,000 AD) (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|Mighty Thor Vol 3 7}} Centuries after that, [[Avengers (Earth-616)|the fifth iteration of the Avengers]] was founded to save the world from [[Loki Laufeyson (Earth-616)|Loki]] - the Asgardian god of mischief - and became one of the world's largest superhero teams.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 1}}\n\n==Members==\n* '''[[Firehair (Earth-616)|Phoenix (Firehair)]]''': The founder of the team; an early human [[Mutant]] who was the first known being on [[Earth]] to be possessed by the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]].\n* '''[[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin Borson]]''': The [[All-Father]] of [[Asgard]] and the [[Glossary:Ten Realms|Ten Realms]].\n* '''[[Agamotto (Earth-616)|Agamotto]]''': The first [[Sorcerer Supreme]] of [[Earth]] and one third of the [[Vishanti (Earth-616)|Vishanti]].\n* '''[[Black Panther (1,000,000 BC) (Earth-616)|Black Panther]]''': The very first [[Black Panther]] of the [[Panther Tribe (Earth-616)|Panther Tribe]], hailing from prehistoric [[Wakanda]].\n* '''[[Fan Fei (Earth-616)|Iron Fist (Fan Fei)]]''': A banished warrior from the ancient city of [[K'un-Lun]] who became the very first [[Iron Fist]].\n* '''[[Vnn (Earth-616)|Starbrand (Vnn)]]''': An early human who was the second being to wield the [[Star Brand (Object)|Starbrand]].\n* '''[[Ghost Rider (1,000,000 BC) (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider (Ghost)]]''': The first [[Ghost Rider]]; a young early human possessed by a [[Spirits of Vengeance (Earth-616)|Spirit of Vengeance]] and riding atop a flaming [[Mammoths|Mammoth]].\n\n| Equipment               = Each member's personal equipment.\n| Transportation          = Each member's personal transportation.\n| Weapons                 = Each member's personal weapons.\n\n| Notes                  = * According to Odin, the Avengers of 1,000,000 BC saved the Earth more times than he can count, implying they either continued operating after the First Host left Earth, or had already performed several successful missions prior to the arrival of The Fallen. {{r|Avengers Vol 8 4}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
