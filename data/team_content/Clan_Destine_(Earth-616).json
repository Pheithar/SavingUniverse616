In recent years, they've become reluctant superheroes due to their youngest family members (the twins, [[Rory Destine (Earth-616)|Rory]] and [[Pandora Destine (Earth-616)|Pandora]]) developing their powers in adolescence.\n\n| HistoryText             = \n===Origins===\nIn 1168 A.D., a man named [[Adam Destine (Earth-616)|Adam]] was born in the small Saxon village of [[Ravenscroft]] in [[England]]. Adam had a near-fatal accident when he was sixteen, but he miraculously recovered after a dream about a strange, inhuman woman. He was renamed Adam of Destine by the town, who felt the young man was destined for greatness. Adam joined the [[Crusades|Third Crusade]] under [[Richard Plantagenet (Earth-616)|Richard the Lionheart]]. During the battles, Adam was never once injured and he believed that the \"angel\" he dreamed about protected him. He became overconfident and was captured by a warlord called [[Al Kadhdhaab (Earth-616)|Al Kadhdhaab]]. When he awoke, Kadhdhaab claimed that he needed Adam's help to defeat the wizard [[Sujanaa min Raghbah (Earth-616)|Sujanaa min Raghbah]]. Sujanaa had a large gem with mystical powers that fulfilled his wishes. In a vision Sujanaa had seen that Adam was destined to kill him and somehow Kadhdhaab had seen this as well. Adam entered Sujanaa's palace and attacked Sujanaa but was easily overcome by the wizard's power. The wizard ranted that his gem loved Adam, and would not allow Sujanaa to hurt him.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 5}}{{r|ClanDestine Vol 2 2}}\n\nAdam managed to distract the wizard by telling him that Sujanaa had wasted his life: all his power was only being used to protect his power. The wizard realised that he had become trapped by his own desire for power and during a moment of doubt, Adam was freed and killed the wizard. Adam then felt that there was something alive within the gem and tried to destroy its prison, but Kadhdhaab stabbed him in the back. Kadhdhaab tried to take the power of the gem for himself, but Adam managed to destroy the gem with his last strength. A female [[Djinn (Race)|genie]], [[Elalyth (Earth-616)|Elalyth]], appeared from the gem and destroyed Kadhdhaab. She then restored Adam, making him immortal and invulnerable and the two became lovers.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 5}}{{r|ClanDestine Vol 2 2}}\n\nAdam and Elalyth's first child, [[Jasmine Destine (Earth-616)|Jasmine]] was born in 1192, with their second child, [[Thaddeus Destine (Earth-616)|Thaddeus]], being born in 1193.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 2 5}}<ref name=\"Clan Destine Timeline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.alandavis-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=304&p=3169&hilit=florence#p3169|title=Clan Destine Timeline|work=alandavis-forum.com|first=Alan|last=Davis|date=13 March 2008|accessdate=5 July 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn 1209, [[Jasmine Destine (Earth-616)|Cuckoo]] travelled to [[Ravenscroft]] to meet her paternal grandparents for the first time. After their meeting, the [[Ravenscroft Manor|ancestral estate]] was established and has been in their family ever since.{{r|X-Men: Clan Destine Vol 1 1}}\n\nSometime between 1210 and 1370, with his curiosity peaked by tales of [[Marco Polo (Earth-616)|Marco Polo]] and [[Temujin (Earth-616)|Genghis Khan]], Adam ventured into [[Asia]] (and specifically [[China]]) several times.<ref name=\"Clan Destine Timeline\"/>\n\nBetween 1217 and 1272, Thaddeus join the [[Knights Templar (Earth-616)|Knights Templar]] and participate in the [[Crusades]].<ref name=\"Clan Destine Timeline\"/>\n\n[[Albert Destine (Earth-616)|Albert]] was born in 1323.<ref name=\"Clan Destine Timeline\"/>\n\nIn the winter of 1374, Thaddeus and Adam were escorting Albert to a [[Shalu Monastery|monastery]] where he could recover from the sorrow of his inability to stave off the [[Black Plague (Event)|black plague]]. On the [[Tibet|Tibetan Plateau]], their party encountered the rogue [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]], [[Tral (Earth-616)|Tral]], controlling an attacking horde. Tral killed Thaddeus by blasting him off a cliff. Albert was so enraged by the murder of his beloved brother that he impulsively used his powers to kill Tral. After the death of Tral, Adam and Albert met members of the [[House of Agon|Inhuman royal family]].{{r|ClanDestine Vol 2 2}}\n\n[[Gracie Gamble (Earth-616)|Gracie]] was born in 1503.{{r|X-Men: Clan Destine Vol 1 2}}\n\n[[File:Jasmine Destine (Earth-616) and Gracie Gamble (Earth-616) from X-Men Clan Destine Vol 1 2 001.jpeg|left|thumb|200px|[[Jasmine Destine (Earth-616)|Cuckoo]] and [[Gracie Gamble (Earth-616)|Gracie]] adventuring into [[Mexico]] with the [[Conquistadores (Earth-616)|Conquistadores]]]]\n\nIn 1519, [[Jasmine Destine (Earth-616)|Cuckoo]]'s host body was a Spanish nobleman. Eager to explore the New World, Cuckoo joined [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s (Earth-616)|Cort\u00e9s]]'s [[Conquistadores (Earth-616)|Conquistadores]] and brought along his young sister, Gracie, posing as a young male and his personal valet. In [[Mexico]], the pair longed to study the [[Aztecs|Aztec people]] and culture, but Cort\u00e9s was only interested in gold. The pair separate during a battle, and Gracie with the Aztecs wanted to explore their magics and accidentally unleashed the [[Demons|demon]] [[Synraith (Earth-616)|Synraith]]. Gracie managed to seal the dimensional rift with the aid of Cuckoo. However, she knew that Synraith would try to return to [[Earth]] and dedicated her life to find a to stop it.{{r|X-Men: Clan Destine Vol 1 2}}\n\n[[Florence Destine (Earth-616)|Florence]] was born in 1531.<ref name=\"Clan Destine Timeline\"/>\n\nIn 1615, Adam was travelling to meet Gracie and Albert, who were in [[Japan]] protecting the [[Tokugawa Ieyasu (Earth-616)|Shogun Tokugawa]] during a coup. During his journey, in the [[Sayan Mountains]], Adam encountered an alien race preparing to invade Earth and single handedly repelled the alien invasion.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 8}}\n\n[[Maurice Fortuit (Earth-616)|Maurice]] was born in 1695.<ref name=\"Clan Destine Timeline\"/>\n\n[[Newton Destine (Earth-616)|Newton]] was born in 1774.<ref name=\"Clan Destine Timeline\"/>\n\nDuring the 1840s, [[Walter Destine (Earth-616)|Walter]] serves in the British Military and fought in the [[Opium War]] in [[Shanghai]].{{r|ClanDestine Vol 2 5}}\n\n[[File:Clan Destine (Earth-616) from ClanDestine Vol 2 1 001.jpeg|300px|thumb|right|[[Adam Destine (Earth-616)|Adam]], [[Maurice Fortuit (Earth-616)|Maurice]], [[Gracie Gamble (Earth-616)|Gracie]], [[Florence Destine (Earth-616)|Flo]] and [[Jasmine Destine (Earth-616)|Cuckoo]] (in the body of an [[India|Indian]] man) in 1849]]\n\nIn 1849, Adam, [[Florence Destine (Earth-616)|Flo]], Maurice, Gracie and [[Jasmine Destine (Earth-616)|Cuckoo]] (in the body of an [[India|Indian]] man) infiltrate [[Guild (Earth-616)|The Guild]] and slew four Guild brothers.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 2 2}}\n\nIn 1854, Walter serves in the British Military and fought in the Battle of Balaclava during the [[Crimean War]].{{r|ClanDestine Vol 2 5}}\n\nIn 1857, Walter was stationed in [[Delhi]], [[India]] and fought in the Sepoy Mutiny.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 2 5}}\n\nDuring the 1860s in [[Japan]], Cuckoo lived in a new host body, a Japanese female and goes by the name [[Natsume Masako (Earth-616)|Natsume Masako]]. During this time, she met, fell in love with, and married [[Sakai Masaaki (Earth-616)|Prince Sakai Masaaki]]. In 1889, Cuckoo and Prince Sakai Masaaki moved to [[Paris (France)|Paris]]. While living in Paris, Cuckoo was attacked by the [[Vampires|vampire]] [[Marietta Borgezia (Earth-616)|Marietta Borgezia]]. With her host body dying, Cuckoo took possession of Borgezia's body. Later, she met a [[Jasmine Destine's Vampire Coven (Earth-616)|group of vampires sired by Borgezia]] who regained their souls when Cuckoo expelled the dark spirit from Borgezia's body.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 2 4}}<ref name=\"Clan Destine Timeline\"/>\n\n===Relative Strangers===\nPredicting the advent of technology, [[Newton Destine (Earth-616)|Newton]] developed the ''[[Relative Stranger Protocol]]''. The protocols would create new identities for the long-lived family members whenever they required it and would protect the family should one of them be uncovered.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 3}}\n\nBetween 1914 and 1918, Walter serves in the British Military and fought in the bloody [[Passchedale|Passiondale]] Campaign during [[World War I]].{{r|ClanDestine Vol 2 5}}\n\nIn 1944 during [[World War II]], Walter's station was attacked by the [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazis]] using a large robotic war machine. The war machine was confronted by the [[Invaders (WWII) (Earth-616)|Invaders]] ([[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], the [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Sub-Mariner]], and the [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Human Torch]]), but it rendered them unconscious. Walter then transformed and destroyed the robot before fleeing from Allied soldiers, who happened on the scene and thought he was in league with the Nazis.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 8}}{{r|ClanDestine Vol 2 5}}\n\n[[Samantha Destine (Earth-616)|Samantha]] was born in 1951.<ref name=\"Clan Destine Timeline\"/>\n\n[[File:Clan Destine (Earth-616) from ClanDestine Vol 1 2 001.jpeg|300px|thumb|left|Photograph of [[Dominic Destine (Earth-616)|Dominic]], [[Jasmine Destine (Earth-616)|Cuckoo]] (in the body of a Native American woman), [[Maurice Fortuit (Earth-616)|Maurice]], [[Vincent Destine (Earth-616)|Vincent]], [[William Destine (Earth-616)|William]], [[Walter Destine (Earth-616)|Walter]], [[Newton Destine (Earth-616)|Newton]], [[Samantha Destine (Earth-616)|Samantha]], [[Adam Destine (Earth-616)|Adam]] and [[Florence Destine (Earth-616)|Flo]] taken by [[Gracie Gamble (Earth-616)|Gracie]] in 1963]]\n\nIn 1963, many of the members of Clan Destine gathered for a family photo in [[Ravenscroft Manor]].{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 2}}\n\nIn 1969, Maurice,  [[Newton Destine (Earth-616)|Newton]], [[Sebastian (Earth-616)|Sebastian]], [[William Destine (Earth-616)|Will]], [[Dominic Destine (Earth-616)|Dominic]], and [[Vincent Destine (Earth-616)|Vincent]] attended [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]] with his brothers using [[Adam Destine's Van|Adam's VW van]].{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 33}}\n\nIn the recent past, Gracie and Cuckoo banished [[Synraith (Earth-616)|Synraith]] from [[Earth]] with the help of [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]]. However, Gracie erased Xavier's memories of the events.{{r|X-Men: Clan Destine Vol 1 1}}\n\nIn the late 20th century, Adam killed [[Vincent Destine (Earth-616)|Vincent]], one of his sons, who had been abusing his powers. The family fell apart after that, several of the family members disagreeing with Adam's decision and Adam left Earth in a [[Adam Destine's Van|vehicle]] created by Newton. The newly born twins, Rory and Pandora, were left with [[Walter Destine (Earth-616)|Walter Destine]], who posed as their uncle and guardian, and [[Florence Destine (Earth-616)|Flo]], who posed as their grandmother.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 1}}{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 8}}\n\n===Imp and the Crimson Crusader===\n[[Rory Destine (Earth-616)|Rory]] and [[Pandora Destine (Earth-616)|Pandora]]'s powers activated far earlier than those of their siblings, because they were twins. The children, believing they were mutants decided to become superheroes. As the [[Crimson Crusader]] and [[Imp]], they set out to battle crime. One evening they found two groups fighting each other over a [[Genetic Realignment Yield Polarity Harmonizing Orientation Net|special device]]: the creature [[Lenz (Earth-616)|Lenz]] and his \"children\" and [[Hywell Griffin (Earth-616)|Dr. Hywel Griffin]] and his [[Omegans (Earth-616)|Omegans]]. Not knowing which side to help, the children grabbed the device, and left the scene, intending to return the device once they found out who the rightful owner was.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 1}}{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 3}}\n\nThe Gryphon turned out to be a device that could change the genetic sequence of living creatures. Lenz, a former human scientist turned into a new species by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] hoped to use the Gryphon to stabilize his \"children\", who usually died within several days. Griffin was an albino who hoped to cure himself with the Gryphon. Both parties tried to track down the Destine twins. During the twins' attempt to flee, Pandora had lost her cape, which had the name of their sister, [[Jasmine Destine (Earth-616)|Kay Cera]], in it, who had designed it. Lenz sent his children out to kill Kay and they found the history of the Clan Destine in Kay's notebook. Kay herself survived by transferring her mind to a cat. Lentz creatures attacked the various members of the Clan Destine, killing Florence and [[Maurice Fortuit (Earth-616)|Maurice]].{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 1}}\n\nMost of the other family members united and tracked down Griffin, whom they thought responsible for the deaths of Flo and Maurice. Lenz appeared and kidnapped Rory, but they were all saved in time by Adam who had felt the death of his children and returned to Earth. Adam defeated Lenz, but let him go when he realised that Lenz was not evil, just trying to let his species survive.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 4}}\n\nThe Clan Destine returned home and Walter forced the children to return to school and live normal lives, even threatening to split them up after they caused trouble. The children fled to [[New York City|New York]] to become full time superheroes, but [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] convinced them to return home.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 6|7}} In return Adam and Walter, following Dominic's advice, would pose as superheroes to help and watch Rory and Pandora during their missions.{{r|ClanDestine Vol 1 8}}{{r|X-Men: Clan Destine Vol 1 1}}\n\n===X-Men===\n[[Synraith (Earth-616)|Synraith]] attempted to enter the [[Earth|Earthly plane]] by abducting the only three individuals who could stop him: [[Gracie Gamble (Earth-616)|Gracie Gamble]], [[Jasmine Destine (Earth-616)|Cuckoo]], and [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Charles Xavier]]. By corrupting the [[Danger Room]], Synraith tried to manipulate the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and the Clan Destine. Luckily, Adaw discovered the ruse and the combined efforts of the X-Men and Clan Destine were able to permanently banish Synraith.{{r|X-Men: Clan Destine Vol 1 1|2}}\n\nFollowing their run-in with the X-Ben, the older members of Clan Destine again tried to scare the twins from wanting to be superheroes with a \"Danger Room\" style exercise using Newton's robots. Unfortunately for Walter, the exercise only solidified the twins' resolve.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 158}}{{r|{{cite web|url=http://www.alandavis-forum.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=285&p=1861&hilit=MCP#p1861|title=Cuckoo's current body?|work=alandavis-forum.com|first=Alan|last=Davis|date=6 August 2005|accessdate=5 July 2021}}}}\n\n===Final Fight with the Omegans===\nDr. Griffin and the Omegans again attacked the Destines. In the course of the attack, what happened to [[Thaddeus Destine (Earth-616)|Thaddeus]] in 1374 was revealed. Newton built a device to help Dominic ameliorate the effects of his powerful senses. Dominic also travelled through time and space, and encountered the superhero group [[Excalibur (Earth-616)|Excalibur]]. Walter also struggled with his fears of becoming like Vincent. Adam reduced Griffin to an infant, and told the Omegans never to threaten his family again, before being reunited with Elalyth, the mother of his children, with whom he went to live in Yden. Dominic decided to relocate to the idyllic [[Earth-2803|Ethera]]. Unknown to anyone, a pool of energy emerged from the grounds of the Ravenscroft, and flew into Vincent's grave, causing the gravestone to crack.{{r|{{cl|ClanDestine Vol 2 1}}-[[ClanDestine Vol 2 5|5]]}}\n\n===Vincent's Return===\n[[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|The Thing]], [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]] and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]] encountered an interdimensional rift whose energy hurled them on a journey through time and space, during which they came into contact with the Destine family at various points in history. Thing in particular encountered Vincent as a young boy, and then as a young man, and was present at his death. Vincent was tortured by his inability to use his powers to stop the pain and suffering in the world, and was revealed to have been possessed by demons who were trying to delay Doctor Strange in healing the dimensional rift. Fearing the destruction Vincent's powers were unleashing and for his son's soul, Adam fatally snapped Vincent's neck. The dimensional energy was driven away, and the heroes were returned home.{{r|Fantastic Four Annual Vol 1 33}}\n\nThe Destines travelled to New York tracking a robot called the [[Plastoid (Earth-616)|Plastoid]]. Cuckoo believed that it was inhabited by a parasitic elemental, whom she intended to banish back to its dimension. Dominic and the rest of the Destines, however, believed the robot was in fact inhabited by Vincent's spirit, and aimed to stop Cuckoo from destroying it. During this conflict they also encountered [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] and Doctor Strange, who assisted the family. Daredevil destroyed the Plastoid, releasing Vincent's spirit from it.{{r|Daredevil Annual Vol 3 1}}{{r|Wolverine Annual Vol 3 1}}\n\n==Members==\n===Living===\n[[File:Clan Destine (Earth-616) Family Tree from ClanDestine Vol 2 1 001.jpg|300px|right|thumb|A partial Clan Destine family tree]]\nIn approximate order of age:\n* [[Elalyth (Earth-616)|Elalyth]], the ancient [[Djinn (Race)|Djinn]] and mother of Clan Destine.\n* [[Adam Destine (Earth-616)|Adam of Destine]], born Adam of Ravenscroft, was made immortal and invulnerable by his lover, [[Elalyth (Earth-616)|Elalyth]], a female djinn. \n* [[Jasmine Destine (Earth-616)|Kay Cera]], a telepath who has lived as a fashion designer in recent years.
