The Nowek were advancing faster than the Locot and the Locot feared they would be subjugated. {{r|Incredible Hulk #454}}\n\n===Events===\nWhen the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]] seemed to join forces with the Locot, the Nowek leader Leesha sought help from [[Kevin Plunder (Earth-616)|Ka-Zar]]. With the help of Ka-Zar and [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], they laid a trap for the Locot but the Hulk disrupted the trap. When a dinosaur attacked during the battle, both sides came together. After, both tribes came together in a celebratory feast but neither Leesha nor the Locot shaman could accept a peace between their two peoples and each poisoned the other tribes' food and water.{{r|Incredible Hulk #454}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Savage Land Tribes]]"
