Jonah Jameson]]) bought out the Alternative and handed it over to Ben Urich, who renamed it '''Front Line''' and became its editor-in-chief. Sally Floyd became the lead reporter.{{r|Civil War: Front Line #11}}\n\n[[File:Daily Bugle (Front Line) (Earth-616) from Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 16 001.jpg|thumb|left|Staff]]\n[[Dexter Bennett (Earth-616)|Dexter Bennett]] bought the [[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|Daily Bugle]] off Jameson while Jameson was ill. After buying the Bugle, Bennett renamed the Bugle as \"[[Daily Bugle (The DB!) (Earth-616)|The DB!]]\" and transformed it into a scandal sheet. This led [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Peter Parker]], [[Joseph Robertson (Earth-616)|Robbie Robertson]], and many others who worked at the Daily Bugle to leave the DB and move to Front Line, especially after the DB! Building was destroyed by Electro, and Bennett didn't bother to rebuild.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #614}}\n\nSometime after, [[Marla Madison (Earth-616)|Marla Jameson]] was able buy back the Daily Bugle shares from Bennett, and Jameson gave the money to Robertson to remake the Front Line into the new Daily Bugle.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #648}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n* According to [[Norah Winters (Earth-616)|Norah Winters]], though the journalists at the Bugle are implored to be fair-minded and impartial, they're a notably \"lefty rag\" or leftist sensationalist or tabloid newspaper.{{r|Dark Reign: The List - Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 1}}\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Newspapers]]\n[[Category:Companies]]"
