Dr. [[Walter Lawson (Earth-616)|Walter Lawson]] worked for them, creating, amongst other things, the robot [[Cyberex (Earth-616)|Cyberex]] and the [[Eon Ray]] gun for them before his assumed death. When the Organization tried to retrieve Cyberex, its agents clashed with [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]].{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 9}} Captain Marvel visited their headquarters, he wanted to agree to a truce with the Organization, upon learning they had taken his friend [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol Danvers]] prisoner, he turned on them. He rescued his friend and upon their escape left the base in the rubble, seemingly shut down their enterprise for good.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 10}}\n\nFormer member [[Deathgrip (Earth-616)|Deathgrip]], who as a result of the explosion was mutated into a vampire-like being, sought the captain, who he thought was the real Walter Lawson. He wanted Lawson to cure him.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 55}} Captain Marvel was unable to find a cure within 48 hours; and in one last-ditch effort, Deathgrip tried to reverse the effects by shooting himself with the Eon Ray. This ended up disintegrated him instead, seemingly killing the last remnants of the consortium.{{r|Captain Marvel Vol 1 56}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The Organization has no apparent connection with the [[Ani-Men (Earth-616)|Ani-Men]], who were originally known as \"The Organization\" while under the leadership of [[Abner Jonas (Earth-616)|The Organizer]]. \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/organization.htm The Organization on Marvunapp]\n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
