In recent times, Chief Inspector [[Dai Thomas (Earth-616)|Dai Thomas]] of the Metropolitan police, reporter [[Kate McClellan (Earth-616)|Kate McClellan]], her son Cam, writer [[Ben Gallagher (Earth-616)|Ben Gallagher]], [[Joseph Chapman (Earth-616)|Joe Chapman, aka Union Jack]], and a number of other individuals including [[Brian Braddock (Earth-616)|Captain Britain]], [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man (Tony Stark)]], the [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]] and [[Peter Hunter (Earth-616)|Peter Hunter]] (the retired superhero named [[Albion]]) were all either possessed or summoned by the Pendragon spirits and fought the Bane, with Gallagher dying in the final battle. \n\nThe Pendragon spirits later left most of those involved, but Albion and Union Jack kept theirs and became members of a more formalized 'team' of knights also including [[Adam Crown (Earth-616)|Adam Crown]], [[Breeze James (Earth-616)|Breeze]] James, the former Bane leader [[Francesca Grace (Earth-616)|Francesca Lexley Grace]] and the android [[Gawain (Robot) (Earth-616)|Gawain]]. This new iteration fought the forces of [[Mys-Tech (Earth-616)|Mys-Tech]] and other threats for some months, but most of the team eventually went their separate ways, with only Albion, Grace, Gawain and Breeze remaining together. Their activities in recent years are unknown. Joseph Chapman, however, does still possess at least a portion of the Pendragon power. \n\n| Equipment               = The latter Knights used special armor they found in the Green Chapel that would customize to the wearer's wishes.\n| Transportation          = Though rarely used, they had access to special vehicles found in the Green Chapel that were capable of transporting the team through space and time and usually had artillery of some kind. \n| Weapons                 = Each teammates' arsenal\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n* http://marveldirectory.com/groupsandteams/knightsofpendragon.htm\n* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_Pendragon\n* http://www.marvel.com/universe/Knights_of_Pendragon\n* http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/kopendragon.htm\n}}\n[[Category:British Organizations]]\n[[Category:Orders of Knights]]"
