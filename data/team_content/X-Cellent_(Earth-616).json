He set his group to track down and capture [[Katie Sawyer (Earth-616)|Katie Sawyer]], daughter of [[X-Statix (Earth-616)|X-Statix]] member [[Edith Sawyer (Earth-616)|U-Go Girl]] in order to force her to join them so she could use her teleportation abilities to help reconstitute the body of [[Dee Milo (Earth-616)|Venus Dee Milo]].\n\nBut Katie was eventually freed by a new incarnation of X-Statix who arrived to Zeitgeist's [[Death Valley]] headquarters to battle against his group until Katie used her powers to transport the team out of there before the X-Cellent could do more damage.{{r|Giant-Size X-Statix Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Media-Driven Characters]]"
