At one point, the [[Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]] space initiative had to fend off the planet from four Chitauri waves in a single month.{{r|Captain America: Steve Rogers Vol 1 8}} After a gigantic Chitauri fleet was destroyed by [[Avril Kincaid (Earth-616)|Quasar]], it was expected that the next Chitauri fleet would be the largest single alien army to ever come to the Earth, and even bigger than the [[Annihilation Wave]].{{r|Civil War II: The Oath Vol 1 1}}\n\nAnother Chitauri fleet was approaching the Earth as the Hydra-loyalist Captain America was putting into motion a plan of conquest. While Alpha Flight and numerous other heavy-hitter heroes were deployed in orbit to fight the aliens, Captain America activated the [[Planetary Defense Shield]], sealing the heroes off from Earth. The Chitauri Wave continued mobilizing despite not being able to enter Earth, wearing off Alpha Flight and the heroes that were left stranded.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 0}} The Planetary Defense Shield was eventually destroyed by Quasar, and [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] destroyed the Chitauri queen eggs, whose location had previously been pin-pointed, putting an end to the Chitauri invasion.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 8}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
