The UCWF is organized into \"weight divisions\"... not based on the wrestler's body weight, but on how much tonnage they can lift. The lowest division (for those with the strength to lift (press) two to ten tons) was phased out early in the Federation's history as not being \"spectacular\" enough.{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Vol 2 #14}}\n\nNumerous superhuman individuals have fought in the UCWF at one time or another, including both those recognized as superheroes and supervillains. Prominent members have included the [[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Thing]], [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]] (then known as Marvel Boy), and [[Dennis Dunphy (Earth-616)|Demolition Man]].{{r|Thing #29|36}} The ranks of the UCWF have also included [[Homo superior|mutants]], [[Glossary:Alien|aliens]], members of the [[Eternals (Homo immortalis)|Eternals]] (like [[Ikaris (Earth-616)|Ikaris]]) and the [[Deviants (Homo descendus)|Deviants]], and many of the other varieties of super-strong beings from throughout the [[Earth-616|universe]].{{r|Eternals Vol 2 #1}}{{r|Avengers #370}}\n\nBy far the most common participants, however, have been those who have undergone the strength-augmenting treatment of the [[Power Broker, Inc. (Earth-616)|Power Broker, Inc.]], a quasi-legal corporation run by [[Curtiss Jackson (Earth-616)|Curtiss Jackson]] that uses the fruits of the many mad scientists populating the [[Earth]]. The process is somewhat risky, however, and many wind up deformed or with severe health problems as a result. Also, the Power Broker organization is not without its corruption; at times, they not only augment their clients, but inject them with highly addictive drugs in order to control them. As a result, many of the Unlimited Class wrestlers also find themselves moonlighting as supervillains.{{r|Captain America #328|331}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:Competitions]]"
