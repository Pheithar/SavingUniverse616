In once instance in 1908, the Deathwalkers used the talisman in [[Tunguska]] to create [[Bear (Hybrid) (Earth-616)|The Bear]]. The spell resulted in an explosion so powerful that it could be heard as far as away as [[London (England)|London]]. This would later be known as the \"Tunguska Event\".{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 12}}\n\nIn 1972, one of their attempts to make the sacrifice was thwarted by the [[Mighty Avengers (1970s) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]]. The Talisman was taken from them and it was hidden in the Himalayas by [[Kaluu (Earth-616)|Kaluu]]. The Talisman made its way to the Inhumans' [[Attilan]].{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 12}}\n\nIn the present times, the Deathwalkers returned to New York,{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 1}} and rediscovered the Talisman once Attilan fell on [[New York City|New York]]. Lichidus sent a hellhound to retrieve it, but if failed and Blade (who was undercover as [[Ronin]]) took it.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 5.INH}}\n\nThe Deathwalkers then proceeded to send numerous creatures to fight the vampire slayer and get it. They finally succedeed in capturing Blade after sending Were-Roosters to battle him, and planned to use his blood for a sacrifice.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 10}}\n\nEven though the [[Mighty Avengers (Cage) (Earth-616)|Mighty Avengers]] located Blade and arrived to help him, the Deathwalker's legion of servants provided a distraction so the heroes couldn't get to Deathwalkers before they could finish their ritual. The successfully-finished ceremony merged them together into the [[Deathwalker Prime (Earth-616)|Deathwalker Prime]], a creature with control over the four elements, thus power over the fifth: the spirit, which would be the key for it to destroy humankind.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 13}}\n\nHowever, the Mighty Avengers managed to get hold of the cup used in the ritual of merging, and using a similar procedure merged themselves into the [[Avenger Prime (Earth-616)|Avenger Prime]], which managed to destroy the Deathwalker Prime, mainly because unlike the Deathwalker, the different personas merged into it were truly spiritually bonded, while the personas composing the Deathwalker were fighting for control.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 14}}\n\n| Equipment               = <br>\n* [[Talisman of Kamar-Taj]]\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Not to be confused with the term \"deathwalkers,\" one of the alternate terms for [[vampires]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
