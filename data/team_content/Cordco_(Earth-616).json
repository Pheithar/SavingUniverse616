While Peter Parker was attending the rocket launch, the [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Six attacked]]. As Spider-Man fought them, Ock loaded his poison dispersal unit into the rocket. Grabbing Spidey, Ock prepared to tear him apart, but [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]] stopped him. Ock used a ray gun to turn Sandman into glass, then forced the Cordco staff to launch the rocket. [[Jason Macendale Jr. (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]] took his pilfered poison capsule and dumped it in Spider-Man's face.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 #338}}\n\nThe Sinister Six didn't understand why Ock's poison did't kill Spider-Man, so Ock revealed that it was actually a drug that caused extreme convulsions in cocaine users; the Sinister Six fled, vowing revenge, while Spider-Man restored Sandman to his normal form. Having learned that Octopus' chemical was depleting the ozone layer at a devastating rate, Spider-Man returned at night to Cordco Incorporated to have [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] launch a prototype satellite into orbit, in order to spray a burundite mist and deactivate the poison effect by [[Mjolnir|Mjolnir's]] mighty wind.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 #339}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Stark Industries Subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:Companies]]"
