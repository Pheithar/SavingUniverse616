The six are also responsible for the creation of the [[Lesser Grey God]], a statuette which has the power to reactivate old curses.{{r|Defenders #94|99}}\n\nThe lesser demons seemingly reformed themselves into the '''Five-Fingered Hand''', which was considered as a group \"in charge\" in Hell, quoted along the [[Lords of the Splinter Realms (Earth-616)|Lords of the Splinter Realms]] and the [[Cabal (Hell) (Earth-616)|Cabal]].{{r|Captain Britain and MI-13 Annual #1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/6fingh.htm Six-Fingered Hand at the Appendix]\n}}\n[[Category:Demonic Organizations]]"
