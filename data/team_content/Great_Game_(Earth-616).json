Matches could vary from one-on-one combat between Players to more complicated criminal acts, thefts, retrievals, or conflicts with non-players. Sponsors (participating or otherwise) could wager on the outcome of a given Match. Referees spotted Players in the field during a Match through a complicated scoring process, and Players could win bonuses and prizes based on their success during matches.\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Competitions]]"
