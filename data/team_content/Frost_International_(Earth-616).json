Winston, however, choose [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma]], before she left the family.{{r|Emma Frost #6}} Adrienne later joined the company,{{r|Emma Frost #10}} and possibly took over it.\n\n[[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] became chairwoman of this multi-billion dollar corporation by using her business instincts and telepathic powers. The company has principally been involved in transportation -- both the building of ships and aircraft, and their use for freight and passenger conveyance -- but has expanded into other fields, particularly electronics.\n\nElectronic and mechanical devices constructed by Frost International have been used by the [[Hellfire Club (Earth-616)|Hellfire Club]] to further their socio-political ambitions. Its facilities have also been used by Frost in her role as White Queen of the Hellfire Club as bases of operations for some of the Inner Circle's clandestine activities.\n\nA few years later, Emma used the company to sponsor the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and [[Utopia (X-Men Base)|Utopia]].{{r|X-Men: Regenesis #1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
