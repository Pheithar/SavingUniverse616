Each of these clones have different abilities from each other. They were programmed to hate [[X-Force (Strike Team) (Earth-616)|X-Force]] and believed that they killed their parents.{{R|Uncanny X-Force #25}} \n\nAs X-Force infiltrates the White Sky's base, the Omega Clans ambushed them. Eventually, X-Force escape from their grasp. X-Force later retreated back to their base in [[Cavern-X]]. After the death [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]], his control over Ultimaton returns to its natural programming \"Killing Mutants\" where their base was nuked. The new Brotherhood and Omega Clan watch on, with Genesis under Daken's arm, and Fantomex dead in a chair.\n\nDuring the last confrontation between the Brotherhood and X-Force, Omega Black and Omega Red were seemingly killed by Evan, while Omega White was mind-wiped, and his body was used as a prison for the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]].{{r|Uncanny X-Force #33|34}}\n\nThe Omega Clan was eventually invited to the new mutant island of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], created by Xavier, Magneto, and [[Moira MacTaggert (Earth-TRN748)|Moira X]] in order to heal mutantdom and start over as a whole species together.{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 5}}\n\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = Ironically, their color scheme bears a resemblance to the flag of the [[Wikipedia:National Bolshevik Party|National Bolshevik Party]].\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:White Sky creations]]\n[[Category:Russian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Soviet Organizations]]"
