The various individuals that comprised the initial group had already had their own brushes with the Lilin,{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 28}}{{r|Ghost Rider/Blaze: Spirits of Vengeance #1}}{{r|Morbius: The Living Vampire #1}}{{r|Darkhold: Pages from the Book of Sins #1}}{{r|Nightstalkers #1}} but most were unaware of the full magnitude of their predicament until Strange magically drew them together to halt an incursion of Lilin in [[Greenland]]. The disparate warriors were not formally grouped at the time, and some of their number were openly hostile to certain others, only working together out of a need to deal with the more imminent threat posed by the demons. Despite this, Strange still named them collectively as the Nine after sending most of them away in the aftermath of the battle.{{r|Ghost Rider Vol 3 31}} \n\nThe Nine battled Lilith and her Lilin on multiple occasions. They were forced to battle fellow member [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]] when he was transformed into 'Switchblade' by the [[Darkhold]]. They also investigated [[Brian Kornfield (Earth-616)|Spider-X]].{{r|Midnight Sons Unlimited #3}}\n\nAfter the final battle with [[Zarathos (Earth-616)|Zarathos]] the remaining members were branded as the Order of the Midnight Sons.{{r|Midnight Sons Unlimited #4}}\n\nA new Midnight Sons team was briefly formed by [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]] to hunt [[zombies]] that had infiltrated their [[Earth-616|Earth]] from [[Earth-2149|another reality]] to try and spread their [[Hunger (Virus)|Hunger Virus]].{{r|Marvel Zombies 4 #1|4}}\n\nWhen Doctor Strange used magic to rebuild [[Las Vegas]], [[Hotel Inferno]] emerged with it. The tower's influence began to change the citizens of Las Vegas,{{r|Doctor Strange: Damnation #1}} making them act on their very base instinct and impulse. In turn, for even the lesser of sins, their souls were taken by [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]].{{r|Doctor Strange #386}} It also engulfed the heroes present at the scene, namely [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]], [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Thor]], [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] and [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]], who were turned into [[Ghost Rider|Ghost Riders]].{{r|Doctor Strange: Damnation #1}} [[Bats (Earth-616)|Bats]], the ghost of Stephen's talking dog, sought [[Wong (Earth-616)|Wong]]'s help to assist Stephen. Wong decided to summon to Strange's aid a new Midnight Sons: Blade, [[Marc Spector (Earth-616)|Mr. Knight]], [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]], [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Doctor Voodoo]], [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Man-Thing]], [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], and finally [[Johnathon Blaze (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] to lead them all.{{r|Doctor Strange: Damnation #1}}\n\n| Equipment               = The \"Brand\" of the Midnight Sons is a small cross with a sharp downward point. It was seared into the arms of an earlier Order of the Midnight Sons in ancient times, and began to appear on some of the modern-era Midnight Sons as they battled Zarathos. The purpose of the brand is to summon its wearers back together in times of great need, and is said to \"hurt like the Devil himself\" until the summons is answered. The brand otherwise remains invisible until it is needed. [[Frank Drake (Earth-616)|Frank Drake]] was turned away from being branded as he was deemed to be too human at the time.{{r|Midnight Sons Unlimited #4}}\n| Transportation          = \n*'''Mystical teleportation''' - A common means of transporting the group instantaneously when needed, and sometimes for moving them between dimensions.\n*'''Hellcycles''' - The hellfire-empowered motorcycles used by the various Spirits of Vengeance.\n| Weapons                 = Various personal armaments. \n\n| Notes                   = \n* The Midnight Sons are typically a loose alliance of heroes, reputed to have had \"a taste of damnation\" that they draw on in order to fight it or who are compelled to fight against it to prevent the same from happening to others.{{r|Midnight Sons Unlimited #4}}\n* Victoria Montesi and [[Yuvraj Singh (Earth-616)|Yuvraj Singh]] indicated that the Sons of Midnight had been active for at least four decades and was a larger organization than previously indicated.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 9|10}}\n\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]"
