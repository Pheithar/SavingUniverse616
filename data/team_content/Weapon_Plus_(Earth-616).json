Funded by the [[United States Government (Earth-616)|U.S. Government]], Thorton formed '''Weapon Plus''',{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 23}} a Program devoted to create [[Super-Soldier Serum|super-soldiers]] based on U.S. Army's [[Project Rebirth (Earth-616)|Project Rebirth]], which birthed the hero [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], retroactively considered to be '''Weapon I'''.{{r|New X-Men #145}}\n\nIn 1945, Thorton located another of Essex's laboratories underneath the [[Ravencroft Institute]] and commandeered it, allying with [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Count Dracula]] in an attempt to cure vampires of their weaknesses. This effort was foiled when Captain America attacked the institute looking for an army-buddy who had been abducted, and [[Jonas Ravencroft (Earth-616)|Jonas Ravencroft]] - the director of the institute - unleashed the grotesque abominations created by Weapon Plus' experiments on them.{{r|Ruins of Ravencroft: Dracula Vol 1 1}}\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Weapon Plus focused its efforts on combating the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|U.S.S.R.]]'s [[Department X (Earth-616)|Department X]], until in 1965 an [[Symbiote Dragons|alien dragon made of living darkness]] was discovered by [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and codenamed the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]]. Terrified by the prospect of an alien invasion, the Weapon Plus program metastasized into multiple installations each seeking a solution to this new threat.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe first nine instalments of Weapon Plus had been partially successful, including '''Weapon III''', which resulted in the creation of the [[Harry Pizer (Earth-616)|Skinless Man]],{{r|Uncanny X-Force #22}} and [[Project Homegrown (Earth-616)|Project Homegrown]], a.k.a. '''Weapon VII''', which produced the cyborg [[Frank Simpson (Earth-616)|Nuke]].{{r|Wolverine: Origins #3|5}}\n\nThe '''[[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X Program]]''' had two iterations, the first being started by criminal mastermind [[Romulus (Earth-616)|Romulus]]{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 53}} and sponsored by the [[United States Government (Earth-616)|U.S. Government]]'s [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|Central Intelligence Agency]],{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 50}} while the second one was formed by [[Canada|Canadian]] government's [[Department K (Earth-616)|Department K]] after the failure of the first installment.{{r|Deadpool and Death Annual #1998}} Although the first iteration successfully applicated the [[Adamantium]] bonding process to the [[Homo superior|mutant]] [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]], he later escaped the [[Weapon X Facility]].{{r|Marvel Comics Presents #72|84}} The results of Weapon X's experiments on Logan were used by Department K to start a new installment, which resulted in the creation of [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]].{{r|Deadpool and Death Annual #1998}}\n\nThe American Weapon X Program later broke off from the Weapon Plus Program when Plus' overseer [[Sublime (Earth-616)|John Sublime]] notified Weapon X director [[Truett Hudson (Earth-616)|Professor Thorton]] that his superiors wanted the project to shut down.{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 23}}\n\nTo prevent subsidiary programs from going rogue, Weapon Plus directly oversaw the creation of the last living weapons operating in the clandestine facilities of [[The World (Weapon Plus)|The World]], employing [[Bolivar Trask (Earth-616)|Bolivar Trask]]'s [[Sentinels|Sentinel]] technology.{{r|New X-Men #142|145}}\n\nThroughout the decades, Weapon Plus has used increasingly more extreme methods to create its super soldiers. Weapon X employed genetic alteration, brainwashing, and memory implants. The latest creations were bred specifically to become mutant-hunting weapons much deadlier than Sentinels.{{r|New X-Men #145}}\n\n== Incarnations ==\n===[[Project Rebirth (Earth-616)|Weapon I]]===\nThe retroactively numbered '''Weapon I''', better known as [[Project Rebirth (Earth-616)|Project Rebirth]], was a [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Army]] / [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|F.B.I.]] joint operation led by [[Abraham Erskine (Earth-616)|Dr. Abraham Erskine]], codenamed ''Professor Reinstein''.{{r|Captain America Comics #1}}\n\nUsing [[Super-Soldier Serum]] and [[Vita-Ray Chamber|Vita-Rays]], Project Rebirth created the icon known as [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]],{{r|Captain America Comics #1}} and was considered by Weapon Plus to be its most successful product.{{r|New X-Men #145}}\n\n===[[Project Brute Force (Earth-616)|Weapon II]]===\n'''Weapon II''' experimented on animals.{{r|New X-Men #130}} The resulting subjects included [[Project Brute Force (Earth-616)|Brute Force]]{{r|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}} and a '''[[Weapon II (Earth-616)|genetically modified squirrel]]''' with abilities similar to [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]].{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 6}}\n\n===[[Weapon III (Earth-616)|Weapon III]]===\nWhile reports stated this phase of the Weapon Plus program additionally focused on animals,{{r|New X-Men #130}} its subject was instead a mutant named '''[[Harry Pizer (Earth-616)|Harry Pizer]]''' a barrister during the [[Cold War]] with elastic and multi-sensory skin who had his powers augmented.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #22}}<ref group=\"note\">It is possible the British division of Weapon Plus had their own numerology, accounting for the above discrepancy.</ref>\n\n===[[Project Sulfur (Earth-616)|Weapon IV]]===\nWhile initially reported to have been performed on various ethnic groups and prisoners,{{r|New X-Men #130}} '''Weapon IV''', also known as \"Project Sulfur\" - was spearheaded by [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-616)|Theodore Sallis]] and developed the [[SO-2 Serum]] that turned him into the [[Man-Thing]].{{r|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n\n===[[Project Venom (Earth-616)|Weapon V]]===\nWhile reported to have been performed on various ethnic groups and prisoners,{{r|New X-Men #130}} '''Weapon V''' - also known as Project Venom - originated as the [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|Sym-Soldier Program]] spearheaded by [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]] during the Vietnam War, and involved bonding wounded soldiers to [[Symbiotes]].{{r|Web of Venom: Ve'Nam Vol 1 1}}{{r|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}} After the failure of the Sym-Soldier prototypes, Weapon Plus took over from S.H.I.E.L.D. and began engineering symbiote super-soldiers using research from government and military super soldier programs such as Project Rebirth 2.0, [[Mercury Team (Earth-616)|Mercury Team]], and the [[Anti-Symbiote Task Force (Earth-616)|Anti-Symbiote Task Force]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 2}}{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n\nWeapon V was decimated when [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]] attacked the headquarters and slaughtered the majority of the personnel present, killing [[Mars Team (Earth-616)|Mars Team]] and project head [[Andrew Breen (Earth-616)|Dr. Andrew Breen]] two days later. In light of the threat posed by Carnage, Professor Junger placed Weapon V on hold and had Weapon Plus' remaining samples of the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel symbiote]] put in stasis.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}} After Carnage's defeat, Professor Junger restarted the program with [[Randall Pierce (Earth-616)|Dr. Pierce]] replacing Dr. Breen as the head researcher.{{r|Weapon Plus: World War IV Vol 1 1}}\n\n===[[Project Power (Earth-616)|Weapon VI]]===\n'''Weapon VI''', a.k.a. Project Power, was spearheaded by [[Noah Burstein (Earth-616)|Dr. Noah Burstein]], resulting in the [[Electro-Biochemical System|procedure]] that gave [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] his powers.{{r|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n\nYears later, a Weapon VI upgrade possessing Wolverine's healing factor, codenamed \"[[Adam (Weapon VI Upgrade) (Earth-616)|Adam]]\", was produced.{{r|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n\n===[[Project Homegrown (Earth-616)|Weapon VII]]===\n<!-- Plagiarism: Weapon Plus on Wikipedia -->\n'''Weapon VII''', better known as [[Project Homegrown (Earth-616)|Project Homegrown]], experimented on human soldiers during the [[Vietnam War]]. Some of the known participants who died in Project Homegrown included Andrew Perlmutter, Michael Labash, John Walsh, James MacPherson, and fourteen other unknown recruits. The only known successful subject of Project Homegrown was [[Frank Simpson (Earth-616)|Sgt. Frank Simpson]] codenamed \"Nuke\", who had armored implants under his epidermis and was given [[Adrenaline Pills]] to alter and control his mood. [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Logan]], who would later become one of Weapon Plus' victims, kidnapped [[Frank Simpson (Earth-616)|Nuke]] as a child and oversaw his conditioning.{{r|Wolverine: Origins #3|5}}\n\n===[[Weapon VIII (Earth-616)|Weapon VIII]]===\n'''Weapon VIII''' used drugs and hypnosis to trigger assassins/sleeper agents.{{r|New X-Men #145}}\n\n===[[Project Psyche (Earth-616)|Weapon IX]]===\n'''Weapon IX''', better known as [[Project Psyche (Earth-616)|Project Psyche]], was a psychological program ran by [[Michael Hunt (Earth-616)|Dr. Michael Hunt]]. His work led to the creation of [[Mary Walker (Earth-616)|Typhoid Mary]].{{r|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n\n===[[Weapon X (Earth-616)|Weapon X]]===\n'''Weapon X''' was started by [[Truett Hudson (Earth-616)|Professor Thorton]] under [[Romulus (Earth-616)|Romulus]]' orders.{{r|Wolverine Vol 3 54}}{{r|Wolverine: Origins #33}} Weapon X operated in both [[Canada]] and the [[United States of America|United States]] through an agreement between [[Central Intelligence Agency (Earth-616)|C.I.A.]] and Canadian Government.{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 50}} It was designed to employ and empower [[Homo superior|mutants]] whose memories were often altered or deleted via several methods, including elaborated sets,{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 50}} and psychic implants provided by [[Aldo Ferro (Earth-616)|Aldo Ferro]].{{r|Wolverine Vol 2 63}}\n\n===[[Weapon XI (Earth-616)|Weapon XI]]===\nFor a long time '''Weapon XI''' remained a mystery,{{r|Weapon X Vol 2 23}} but was revealed to be another stage of Weapon X created by [[Romulus (Earth-616)|Romulus]].{{r|Wolverine: Origins Vol 1 33}} He used Wolverine's son Daken and bonded his bones to the [[Muramasa]] metal in hopes of creating a warrior that could take down Logan.{{r|Wolverine: Origins Vol 1 36}} \n\n===Weapons from The World===\nThe following weapons were created under the direct influence of the [[Sublime (Earth-616)|Sublime]] bacterium and inside [[The World (Weapon Plus)|The World]], a facility originally based in Britain, that warped time to grow and develop an entire civilization solely for the production of super-soldiers. The result was to be a team called the Super-Sentinels: a mutant-hunting team of \"superheroes\" with a base in a Weapon Plus space station. This team, a brainchild of John Sublime, was intended to be a publicity stunt that would commercialize the genocide of mutants as part of a reality show. This was supposed to make it more palatable to the public.{{r|New X-Men #143}}\n\n====[[Weapon XII]]: [[Zona Cluster-6 (Earth-616)|Huntsman]]====\nWeapon Plus created Weapon XII (aka [[Zona Cluster-6 (Earth-616)|Huntsman]], real name Zona Cluster 6) at the England-based facilities of The World. He was the first living weapon created employing artificial evolution and [[Nano-Sentinels|nanosentinel]] technology. Weapon XII was \"accidentally\" unleashed on the [[Channel Tunnel]] and fought [[X-Corporation]] members [[Samuel Guthrie (Earth-616)|Cannonball]], [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|M]], [[Laynia Petrovna (Earth-616)|Darkstar]], [[Julio Richter (Earth-616)|Rictor]], [[Theresa Rourke (Earth-616)|Siryn]], and [[James Madrox (Earth-616)|Multiple Man]]. Weapon XII was eliminated by [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]] with the aid of [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] and [[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor X]], but at the cost of Darkstar's life.{{r|New X-Men #128|130}}\n\n====[[Weapon XIII]]: [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]]====\nWeapon Plus created Weapon XIII [[Charlie Cluster-7 (Earth-616)|Fantomex]], whose real name is Charlie Cluster-7, also at The World. However, Fantomex rebelled against his creators. Much like Weapon XII, Fantomex's powers derive from nanosentinel technology.{{r|New X-Men #130}}\n\n====[[Weapon XIV]]: [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]]====\nWeapon XIV was created in The World by John Sublime using ovaries stolen from [[Emma Frost (Earth-616)|Emma Frost]] to create daughters/clones the [[Stepford Cuckoos (Earth-616)|Stepford Cuckoos]]. Originally numbering in the thousands, only 5 were active. They were created to entrap the [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]] to use its power to fuel their psychic abilities so they can wipe out all mutants on earth.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Warsong #1|5}}\n\n====[[Weapon XV]]: [[Ultimaton (Earth-616)|Ultimaton]]====\nThe \"ultimate\" creation of Weapon Plus designated Weapon XV, a.k.a. [[Ultimaton (Earth-616)|Ultimaton]], designed to be the Super-Sentinels' grand powerhouse.{{r|New X-Men #144|145}}\n\n====[[Weapon XVI]]: [[Allgod]]====\nWeapon XVI is a \"living religion\", a virus that attacks the \"faith reserves\" and makes them subservient to the World's sentience. For it to work one has to believe in some sort of god.{{r|Dark Reign: The List - Wolverine #1}}\n\n<!-- \n===Weapon XXX===\n -->\n==Checks and Balances==\nWhile the project was underway various groups and factions. including some within the participating governments, funded the creation of a separate initiative to make countermeasures for the Weapon Plus Programs. Members of the Weapon Plus Projects were completely unaware that the schematics of their projects were given to Weapon Minus to construct fail-safe for their products.{{Citation}}\n\n===Known examples===\n====Total Elimination of Super-Soldiers====\nA [[Glossary:Robot|robot]] originally made by a paranoid [[Daniel Shumann (Earth-616)|Professor Shumann]] who was worried that super-soldiers would take over the world. It was never deployed, having been built in secret and housed in Shumann's old residence until it was activated by a [[Richard Rennsalaer (Earth-616)|desperate S.H.I.E.L.D. agent]] looking for revenge. The only known product was [[TESS-One (Earth-616)|TESS-One]].{{r|Captain America Annual #8}}\n\n====Doctor Mindbubble====\nA number of scientists were funded by SHIELD to create counters to the Weapon Plus program in case it went off the rails. In what was then explicitly labelled the Weapon Minus program, one of these scientists when his branch of the project had his funding and materials cut was forced to test the resultant mixture of Super-Soldier Serum and LSD on himself, the result was named [[Horace Littleton (Earth-616)|Doctor Mindbubble]]. He was intended to counter Weapon VII.{{Citation}}\n| Equipment               = State-of-the-art and sophisticated equipment.\n| Transportation          = Various\n| Weapons                 = Military standard when not accounting for weapons equipped to the Super Soldiers and those geared to take down the super-soldiers themselves\n| Notes                   = <references group=\"note\" />\n* It should be noted that by the time of the World, all iterations had some kind of self destruct trigger implanted in them.
