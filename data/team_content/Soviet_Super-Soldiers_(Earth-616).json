The [[Homo superior|mutant]] [[Mikhail Ursus (Earth-616)|Mikhail Ursus]] was the first trainee selected and became known as Ursa Major due to his ability to shape-shift into a large brown bear.{{r|Incredible Hulk #258}}\n\nThe next recruits to the team were the brother and sister mutants [[Laynia Petrovna (Earth-616)|Laynia Petrovna]] and [[Nikolai Krylenko (Earth-616)|Nikolai Krylenko]], who became Darkstar and Vanguard.
