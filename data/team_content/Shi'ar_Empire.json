Conquered worlds are permitted to self-govern within limits given by the empire.{{r|Marvel Fact Files Vol 1 38}}\n\n====Fraternity of Raptors====\nThousands of years ago the ancient [[Shi'ar (Race)|Shi'ar]] travelled to [[Null Space]] to find the [[Tree of Shadows]]. It was planted by [[Ord Zyonz (Earth-616)|the Gardener]] eons ago and grew in the sorcery of the [[Darkforce Dimension]]. The [[Deviant Skrull|Skrulls]] were also in search of the tree. The two were at war but one of the Shi'ar arrived at the tree first becoming the first [[Fraternity of Raptors (Earth-616)|Raptor]].{{r|Infinity Countdown: Darkhawk Vol 1 3}}\n\n====Empire expansion====\nThe Empire spread out and their warriors conquered various races such as [[Chameloids]], [[Lupak]]s, [[Stygians (Aliens)|Stygians]], [[Strontians]], [[Hodinns]], [[Saurids]] and many more.\n\n====Invasion of Tryl'sart====\nLong ago the Shi'ar invaded [[Tryl'sart]] the home world of the [[Mephitisoids]]. The Shi'ar arrived to the world to bring civilization to the primitive world. However this was a lie and the Mephitisoids had technology almost equal to the Shi'ar. The Shi'ar conquered the peaceful Mephistoids stealing their technology. The true history was lost to legend and propaganda.{{r|Avengers #379}} \n\n====Rook'shir====\nCenturies ago [[Rook'shir (Earth-616)|Rook'shir]] was bonded to [[Phoenix Force (Earth-616)|Phoenix Force]]. He became a Dark Phoenix and wreaked havoc across Shi'ar Empire. The first [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]] was formed to stop him, and they succeeded. Rook'shir was killed by the Imperial Guard's leader; [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]]. For five hundred years all his descendants were culled, out of fear that one of them might host the Phoenix Force like their ancestor. Rook'shir left behind a sword known as the [[Blade of the Phoenix]] which contained a small portion of the Phoenix Force's power. The sword could only be lifted by Rook'shir's descendants. [[Korvus Rook'shir (Earth-616)|Korvus]] is the only known surviving descendant of Rook'shir.{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 1 479}}\n\n===[[Modern Age]]===\n====Phoenix Saga====\n[[D'ken Neramani]], a corrupt Shi'ar ruler, attempted to use the powerful [[M'kraan Crystal]] to take over the universe. His younger sister [[Lilandra Neramani (Earth-616)|Lilandra]] and her new allies, the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], foiled his plans. He was rendered comatose by the crystal, and Lilandra took over as the Majestrix of the Shi'ar Empire.{{r|X-Men #107|109}}\n\n====The Trial of Galactus====\nThe Shi'ar put [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] on trial for the crimes of genocide. He was guilty of reviving [[Galan (Earth-616)|Galactus]] after he was defeated on Earth. Shortly after his revival, Galactus proceeded to consume the [[Skrull]] [[Tarnax IV|throneworld]], resulting in the death of billions. [[Uatu (Earth-616)|Uatu the Watcher]], acting as his lawyer and with the help of [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] and Galactus himself, convinced the gathered tribunal that Galactus was a necessary force of betterment of the universe, not a villain. This was done by summoning [[Eternity (Earth-616)|Eternity]]. The truth as shown by Eternity however, was so grand and overpowering that none of the tribunal's members could remember it fully, although the comprehension stayed.{{r|Fantastic Four #261|262}}\n\n====Deathbird, the Kree-Shi'ar War, and the Spartoi====\nLilandra and D'ken's unstable exiled elder sibling, [[Cal'syee Neramani (Earth-616)|Deathbird]], made several attempts to overthrow her sister from power. Deathbird even resorted to attacking Lilandra's Earth-based allies in order to achieve her goals. She was also responsible for initially directing the alien parasites known as the [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] towards the Earth and its heroes.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #162}} Deathbird was eventually deposed with the assistance of the X-Men.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #275}}\n\nThe Shi'ar annexed the [[Kree Empire]] at the end of the [[Kree-Shi'ar War]] and Deathbird was placed into a prominent position as viceroy of [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]], the Kree homeworld. However, Deathbird did not last long in this position and the current status of the Kree territories is unclear.{{r|Operation Galactic Storm}}\n\nThe Shi'ar have had recent contact with the [[Spartoi]], described as an equally advanced distant race.{{r|Inhumans Vol 3 #3|-{{cl|Inhumans Vol 3 4|4}}}}\n\n====Cassandra Nova====\n[[Charles Xavier (Earth-616)|Professor Xavier's]] evil twin sister, [[Cassandra Nova Xavier (Earth-616)|Cassandra Nova]], single-handedly destroyed a good portion of the Shi'ar Empire. Inhabiting the body of her brother, Nova asserted control of Empress Lilandra and caused a Shi'ar civil war. [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Jean Grey]] was instrumental in ending this threat.{{r|New X-Men #122|126}}\n\n====Phoenix Endsong & End of Greys====\nEven though Jean Grey did the Shi'ar a big favor by eliminating the threat of Cassandra Nova, the Shi'ar still wanted her dead. A group of Shi'ar tried to permanently kill the [[Phoenix Force]] and Jean Grey. Jean, however, escaped their suicide bomb attack and returned to the White Hot Room to restore herself.{{r|X-Men Phoenix Endsong #5}} The Shi'ar wanted to wipe out the Grey genome and [[Quintavius Quire (Earth-616)|Quentin Quire]] with the purpose of eliminating the possibility of a new Omega-level mutant becoming a host for the Phoenix Force. The [[Shi'ar Death Commandos (Earth-616)|Shi'ar Death Commandos]] murdered Jean Grey's [[John Grey (Earth-616)|father]], [[Elaine Grey (Earth-616)|mother]], [[Gailyn Bailey (Earth-616)|niece]], [[Joseph Bailey (Earth-616)|nephew]], and other relatives in a mass assassination, thus inciting the wrath of Jean's alternate reality daughter [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]], who vowed vengeance on the entire Shi'ar Empire.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #466|468}} Recent events seem to indicate the Shi'ar Council was responsible for this, and that Lilandra was unaware of what had been done in her name.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #481}}\n\n====Fall of the Shi'ar====\nAnother Shi\u2019ar threat came from an X-Men villain called [[Gabriel Summers (Earth-616)|Vulcan]]. During his tenure as majestor of the empire, D'ken killed Vulcan's mother [[Katherine Summers (Earth-616)|Katherine Summers]] (also mother to long time X-Men [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Scott]] and [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Alex Summers]]) and made him a slave for most of his adolescent life. Bent on revenge against D'ken, Vulcan attacked the Empire. Not only that, but within the empire, there was a coup to dethrone Lilandra and return D'ken to power, with the aid of Deathbird. The X-Men once again teamed up with their space allies, the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]], to stop both Vulcan and the plot to return rulership of the empire to D'ken. In the end, Vulcan killed his father, [[Christopher Summers (Earth-616)|Corsair]], and D'ken, and assumed the throne of the Shi'ar Empire for himself, with Deathbird as his queen; Lilandra and the Starjammers led a resistance against Vulcan's rule.{{r|Uncanny X-Men #475|486}}\n\n====Emperor Vulcan====\nThe civil war between Vulcan's forces and those loyal the dethroned Lilandra raged on. Led by [[Alexander Summers (Earth-616)|Havok]] and the Starjammers, Lilandra's forces gradually whittled away at Vulcan's forces, which were plagued by defections. The Shi'ar, contrary to Vulcan's expectations, were not happy to have an outsider as their ruler. Vulcan was discouraged by this, but Deathbird convinced him that they would come to accept him.{{r|X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #1}}\n\nWarned in advance of a rebel raid on [[Feather's Edge]], Vulcan and his fleet ambushed the Starjammers. However, in the middle of the battle, his ship, the Hammer, was destroyed by the [[M'Kraan (Race)|Scy'ar Tal]] (translates as ''\"Death to the Shi'ar\"''). Vulcan and [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]] (still the praetor of his [[Imperial Guard (Earth-616)|Imperial Guard]]) attacked the leader of the Scy'ar Tal and were easily defeated, whereupon they retreated deeper into Shi'ar space.{{r|X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #1}}\n\n[[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Marvel Girl]] made contact with the Eldest Scy'ar Tal and discovered their true origin. The Scy'ar Tal were originally called the ''M'Kraan''. Early in their history, the Shi'ar attacked them, killed a great number of their people, making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shi'ar settled on their planet, took the M'Kraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the M'Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities, Sharra & K'ythri. The M'Kraan then changed their name to Scy'ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi'ar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feather's Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After which, Vulcan made contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire.{{r|X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #1|2}}\n\nUnder the ceasefire, the Shi'ar and the Starjammers decided to take out the Finality, thus crippling the Scy'ar's biggest threat. Once Havok and Vulcan were in position to destroy Finality, the Eldest Scy'ar tried to stop them. Once Vulcan figured out how the Eldest was powered, he severed the connection Eldest had with his brothers, making him powerless. Once the connection was severed, the Scy'ar become unorganized, and the tide of the battle shifted to the Shi`ar. The Shi'ar then proceed to attack both the Scy'ar and the Starjammers. Meanwhile, Vulcan blasted Havok into a sun.{{r|X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #3|-{{cl|X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #4|4}}}}\n\nVulcan decided to use Finality to destroy the Scy'ar by using the weapon to place a star in the middle of their fleet. Alex returned and, having absorbed enough power to burn him, decided to end things with Vulcan. While they battled, Rachel and Korvus tried, but failed to stop the beacon that would initiate the attack by the Shi'ar. The Shi'ar Imperial Guard ended Alex's battle with Vulcan by appearing with the Starjammers in captivity, threatening to kill them. Before surrendering, Alex destroyed Finality. With Alex and the Starjammers in custody Vulcan declared that he would return the Shi'ar Empire to its former glory.{{r|X-Men: Emperor Vulcan #5}}\n\nVulcan decides to once again pursue the expansionist policies that were abolished by Lilandra and launches an invasion of Kree space, capturing several outlying worlds. The Kree Empire now led by the Inhuman royal family retaliates and are locked in a bitter war against the Shi'ar. Vulcans faction of Shi'ar however are opposed from within by a faction led by former Majestrix Lilandra and the Starjammers led by Vulcans brother Alex. The Kree also gain assistance from among others the Guardians of the Galaxy as well as Blastaar. [[Kallark (Earth-616)|Gladiator]] eventually betrays Vulcan as well, siding with Lilandra. Vulcan accepts the aid of the ancient Brotherhood of Raptors who assassinate Lilandra during a riot on Chandilar.{{r|War of Kings #1|4}}\n\nMeanwhile the Inhuman king [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Black Bolt]] plans to detonate a bomb which will turn the entire galaxy into Inhumans. Vulcan goes to stop him and after a bitter battle Vulcan makes Black Bolt scream (despite the fact that a whisper from Blackbolt can be deadly) which causes the bomb to overload and create a great fault rift in the Universe and presumably killing Black Bolt and Vulcan. On the ruins of Chandilar Gladiator picks up the Imperial Scepter and is hailed by the masses as Majestor.{{r|War of Kings #5|6}}\n\n====Gladiator's Rule====\nGladiator reluctantly accepted the title of Majestor of the Shi'ar Empire but due to their defeat by the Kree, the Shi'ar are now little more than puppets of the Kree.{{r|War of Kings: Who Will Rule? #1}}\n\n======Time Runs Out======\nWhen the focus of the decay of the universe was found to be the [[Earth]], the Majestor addressed the [[Galactic Council (Earth-616)|Galactic Council]], and decided that the Earth had to be destroyed to save the universe.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 #41}} Even though the Shi'ar planned a sneak attack on the Earth, the Guardians of the Galaxy managed to discover their plan and warned the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 42}}\n\nWhile approaching Earth, the Shi'ar alerted humanity that they had two hours left to live until Earth was destroyed by their fleet. Using a super weapon capable of channelling the Earth's power, Sunspot and A.I.M. retaliated against the Shi'ar in front, while S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Avengers used a [[Planetkiller]] seized from the Builders to attack from behind. However, A.I.M.'s weapon overheated and exploded, and the Planetkiller was destroyed by the [[Annihilation Wave]]. With no options left, the Avengers prepared to meet their end. However, the Illuminati used the controller disk of a rogue planet that shared the same space with Earth while phased while Iron Man flew to the [[Sol's Hammer]], and prepared to use it.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 43}}\n\nIron Man charged and fired Sol's Hammer, successfully destroying the Shi'ar fleet, including the Imperial Guard.{{r|Avengers Vol 5 44}}<!--\n\n...{{r|Avengers Vol 8 27}}{{r|Avengers Vol 8 29}}{{r|Avengers Vol 8 30}}\n...{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 1}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 2}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 5}}{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 7}}\n\n...{{r|X-Men Vol 5 8}}{{r|X-Men Vol 5 9}}-->\n\n======Empyre======\nThe Shi'ar monitored [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]] as he ascended to the throne of the [[Kree/Skrull Alliance (Earth-616)|Kree-Skrull Alliance]].<!-- {{r|King in Black: Wiccan and Hulkling #1}} -->\n\nAfter the resolution of the [[Empyre (Event)|conflicts]] sparked by the merger of the Kree and Skrull, vice-chancellor [[T'Kao (Earth-616)|T'Kao]], the representative of the [[Shi'ar Empire]] to Emperor Hulkling offered and his husband [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] a honeymoon on [[Little Chandilar]] as wedding gift.{{r|King in Black: Wiccan and Hulkling #1}}\n\nMeanwhile, a diplomatic summit was convened at the [[Proscenium]] to explore how intergalactic relations would be impacted by the new alliance, to discuss the status of the [[Pan-Worlds Treaties]], and to seek a path towards stability and peace among the assembled factions. In attendance were representatives of the Kree/Skrull Alliance, the [[Utopian Kree]] faction, the [[Kymellians]], the [[Rigellians]], [[Earth]], the [[Galactic Rim Collective]], the [[Badoon Sisterhood (Earth-616)|Badoon]] (in fact the weapons dealer and [[Elders of the Universe (Earth-616)|Elder of the Universe]] known as the [[Profiteer (Earth-616)|Profiteer]]), [[Spartax (Planet)|Spartax]], the [[Chitauri]], the [[Zn'rx Empire|Zn'rx]], and the Shi'ar, represented by [[Subguardian Oracle-2 (Earth-616)|Oracle-2]].<!-- {{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 7|8}} -->\n\nChaos ensued when the Profiteer, hoping to precipitate another Snarkwar (and the resulting lucrative weapons market), assassinated the Emperor. Further efforts to destabilize the conference were exposed when the attending Chitauri representative, the diplomat-drone [[Peacebringer (Earth-616)|Peacebringer]], was revealed to have been created as a walking bio-explosive bomb.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 7|8}}\n\n======The King in Black======\nWhile Hulkling and Wiccan (along with [[Lauri-Ell (Earth-616)|Lauri-Ell, the Accuser]]) were on Little Chandilar, the planet was attacked by the forces of the [[Glossary:Elder Gods|ancient entity]] [[knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]: [[Symbiote Dragons]], and the Kree of [[Talos (Earth-616)|Talos]] (lost to the Symbiotes [[Web of Venom: Empyre's End Vol 1 1|earlier]]). Hulkling, Wiccan and Lauri-Ell fought the Symbiotes and led the evacuation of the planet.{{r|King in Black: Wiccan and Hulkling #1}}\n\nIn the midst of the Proscenium summit chaos,<!-- the information was passed to the conference's members as the two hostiles had been unveiled (though not subdued) --> those in attendance received word that planets within Shi'ar Space (along with many other worlds) were being stripped of life by the advance of Knull.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 6 8}}\n\nAfterwards, several Shi'ar colonies fell to the [[Symbiote Dragons]] (at least four during a single week).{{r|S.W.O.R.D.
