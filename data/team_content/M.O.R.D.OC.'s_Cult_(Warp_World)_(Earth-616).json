M.O.R.D.OC. attacked Soldier Supreme, for which the recently-arrived sorcerer defeated him and his cultists, whom Soldier Supreme ordered to flee and leave their lifestyle behind, while M.O.R.D.OC. escape to another dimension.{{r|Infinity Wars: Soldier Supreme Vol 1 2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Infinity Warps]]"
