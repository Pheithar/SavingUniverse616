While Gears didn't want to be political, he believed it was his job as a mechanic to fix and help robots.\n\nAfter raiding the remains of a destroyed [[Robowerx (Earth-616)|Robowerx]] factory, the Midnight Wreckers were forced to retreat by a group of [[Baintronics Incorporated (Earth-616)|Baintronics]] security robots. When they returned to their hideout at [[Tommy's Scrap Yard]], they were aproached by a Baintronics employee named [[Rahman Bashara (Earth-616)|Rahman Bashara]] who believed in A.I. independence. Afterwards, the Wreckers' base was consecutively attacked by members of the [[A.I. Army (Earth-616)|A.I. Army]], who mistakenly believed Gears to be oppressing A.I.s, and Baintronics robots, who had trailed Dr. Bashara.{{r|2020 Machine Man Vol 1 1}}\n\n[[Hassle (Earth-616)|Hassle]] prepared to kill Bashara, believing him to be a spy, but [[Swift (Midnight Wreckers) (Earth-616)|Swift]] convinced her to give him a chance. [[Bags (Earth-616)|Bags]], Hassle and Swift fended off the Bain-Robots, with Hassle specifically covering Bashara until he hacked the control module inside the head of one of the robots to knock them all offline. After the A.I. Army soldiers were convinced by [[Ralphie (Robot) (Earth-616)|Ralphie]] that their attack was misguided, the Midnight Wreckers parted ways with Gears and left the hideout, with Bashara having joined their ranks under the alias of Brain.{{r|2020 Machine Man Vol 1 2}}\n\nHaving decided to take an active role in the robot revolution, the Midnight Wreckers attacked a top-secret Baintronics site. They found a robot torture chamber where Bain scientists were experimenting on ways to keep robots subservient by simulation of pain. Their robotic victims asked the Midnight Wreckers to put them out of their misery, and Brain became distressed that he couldn't save them. Hassle comforted him, and stayed behind as her teammates left to grant the robots their wish.{{r|2020 Iron Age Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
