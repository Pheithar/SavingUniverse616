Apparently [[Adolf Hitler (Earth-616)|Hitler]] didn't see the value of these robot soldiers, choosing instead to send an entire generation of young men off to their deaths.\n\nThe robots apparently worked via mental contact with Krone through a headset which he wore. It seems that if this mental link was broken, if Krone were knocked unconscious for instance, then the robots would cease to function.{{r|Avengers 1959 Vol 1 5}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Robots]]\n[[Category:Robots (Full Listing)]]"
