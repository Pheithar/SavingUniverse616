The word comes from a Czech word, robota, meaning \"forced labor\". Instead, they suggested \"semi-autonomous, artificially intelligent, limited-nanofunction, humanform mecha constructs,\" as well as also often referring to one another and other such beings as \"mecha\".{{r|Livewires Vol 1 1|2}}{{r|Black Panther and the Agents of Wakanda Vol 1 5}}\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D.
