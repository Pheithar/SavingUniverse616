He sent [[Erik Josten (Earth-616)|Power Man]], [[Arthur Parks (Earth-616)|Living Laser]] and [[David Cannon (Earth-616)|Whirlwind]] up against the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] after boosting their powers with a machine invented by [[Kenneth Sturdy (Earth-616)|Professor Kenneth Sturdy]], but they were unaware that each use of their increased abilities hastened the process of transferring them to Nefaria himself. The Legion were left weakened and were easily defeated by the Avengers.{{r|Avengers Vol 1 164}}\n\nNefaria reassembled the Lethal Legion many years later, with the [[Paul Duval (Earth-616)|Grey Gargoyle]] replacing Power Man, when he sought to use the [[Catalyst (Item)|Catalyst]], an energy source developed by [[Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. (Earth-616)|Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S.]]. After employing the [[Dmitri Smerdyakov (Earth-616)|Chameleon]] to copy all the research notes from the doctor who discovered the Catalyst, the Lethal Legion raied the [[Project P.E.G.A.S.U.S. Facility]] to kill him to avoid anybody using his knowledge to stop Nefaria.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 41}}\n\nThe Lethal Legion next attacked [[Empire State University]], where the Catalyst was being exposed for a public demonstration. The Lethal Legion's massacre of spectators was interrupted by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], but he was overpowered by the villains. When the vicious vigilante [[Stanley Carter (Earth-616)|Sin-Eater]] arrived on the scene, he murdered all four members and Count Nefaria, gaining the approval of the bystanders. Due to his new supernatural nature, the Sin-Eater stole the powers of each member of the Lethal Legion when he killed them. Furthermore, all four Legionnaires and Nefaria returned to life shortly afterward, filled with a new-found sense of repentance for their crimes. The Legion and Nefaria were subsequently incarcerated at the [[Ravencroft Institute]], where they became model patients.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 41}} After the \"sins\" accumulated by the Sin-Eater were transferred into the [[Order of the Web (Earth-616)|Order of the Web]]{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 50}} and then they were expunged from this corruption,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 52}} they went back to their original hosts, causing the Lethal Legion to regain their powers and return to their normal self.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 56}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
