Squadron Leader Colin was, seemingly, the only survivor. Colin's new-found hatred of Humankind over the death and depowerment of mutants all over the world, for which he assumed humans were responsible, led him to join with fellow depowered mutants and strike back by bombing the Main Line Railway Terminus in what was declared to be a \"taste of what is to come.\"{{Citation}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = Some consider Scarlet Knight Colin's attack to have been a suicide bombing, but Colin's speech would seem to indicate that he and others plan to perform more bombings.\n\nThe Scarlet Knight character has not been seen in any subsequent issues of the New Excalibur series, and with its cancellation Colin's fate may never be revealed.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Characters by Family]]\n[[Category:British Organizations]]"
