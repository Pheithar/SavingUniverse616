While fighting the creatures, Moon Knight hurled one of the Vermin off the building, killing it, as a warning. Threatening to kill all of the Vermin, Moon Knight prompted the creatures to flee.{{r|Moon Knight Vol 9 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
