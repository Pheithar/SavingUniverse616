The young heroes desired to rectify the state of distrust by the people towards superheroes in general, and soon recruited other teenagers with similar ideals, the new [[Amadeus Cho (Earth-616)|Hulk]], and [[Vivian (Synthezoid) (Earth-616)|Viv]], daughter of the [[Vision (Earth-616)|Vision]].{{r|Champions Vol 2 1}}\n\nAfter their first joint mission rescuing a group of girls being trafficked by [[Pagliacci (Earth-616)|Pagliacci]], the young heroes revealed themselves to the public and Ms. Marvel proclaimed the team's mission to foster a better tomorrow through hope and wisdom rather than unjust force. Her speech became viral on the Internet, and the team was dubbed the \"Champions\" in social media.{{r|Champions Vol 2 1}} One of the people encouraged by Ms. Marvel's speech was the time-displaced young [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], who was admitted into the Champions' ranks after requesting membership.{{r|Champions Vol 2 2}}\n\n[[File:Champions Vol 2 1 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Original roster]]\nIn their further early adventures, the Champions traveled to [[Sharzhad]] and helped a young girl named [[Amal (Earth-616)|Amal]] stop militant fundamentalists from enforcing a gender apartheid;{{r|Champions Vol 2 3}} they were confronted by an [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] colony while cruising over their waters;{{r|Champions Vol 2 4}} and were joined by teenage hero [[Gwendolyn Poole (Earth-TRN565)|Gwenpool]] in fighting the xenophobic head of [[Daly County]]'s police, [[Sheriff Studdard (Earth-616)|Sheriff Studdard]].{{r|Champions Vol 2 5}} During the [[Leviathon Tide (Earth-616)|Leviathon Tide]]'s invasion on [[Earth]], the Champions crossed paths with the [[Freelancers (Earth-616)|Freelancers]], a group of teenage mercenaries, who were at the time working for [[Roxxon Energy Corporation (Earth-616)|Roxxon]] to silence protesters.{{r|Champions Vol 2 1.MU}} The Freelancers' employers would make efforts to discredit the Champions, framing the young heroes for attacking homeless people,{{r|Champions Vol 2 6}} and later trademarking the Champions' logo. The Champions managed to clean the name, and Nova started a countermovement to reject the Champions-branded merchandise.{{r|Champions Vol 2 8}}\n\n===[[Secret Empire (Event)|Secret Empire]]===\nWhen [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] assumed control of the [[United States of America]] under the leadership of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-61311)|an evil alternate version of Captain America]], the Champions were separated. Nova became trapped beyond the [[Planetary Defense Shield]] in [[Earth Orbit]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 3}} Ms. Marvel worked with the [[Warriors (Earth-616)|Warriors]] to fight off [[Inhumans (Inhomo supremis)|Inhuman]] internment camps,{{r|Secret Warriors Vol 2 1}} and Scott was displaced to [[New Tian]] with America's [[Homo superior|mutants]].{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 7}} Amadeus, Viv, and Miles eventually joined the [[Underground (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Underground]] where they associated with [[Riri Williams (Earth-616)|Ironheart]], and the new younger incarnations of [[Nadia Van Dyne (Earth-616)|Wasp]], the [[Joaqu\u00edn Torres (Earth-616)|Falcon]] and [[Rayshaun Lucas (Earth-616)|Patriot]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 1}}\n\n[[File:Secret Empire Uprising Vol 1 1 Albuquerque Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|The Red Room]]\nAfter Hydra leveled [[Las Vegas]], [[Natalia Romanova (Earth-616)|Black Widow]] set out to assassinate Captain America. Spider-Man joined her, having decided to stop running away from his supposed destiny to kill Captain America, as prophesied by the Inhuman precog [[Ulysses Cain (Earth-616)|Ulysses Cain]]. The remaining Champions, alongside Ironheart, the Wasp and the Falcon, followed him to offer their support, thus joining Black Widow's [[Red Room (Secret Empire) (Earth-616)|Red Room]].{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 2}} The teenagers were eventually captured by Hydra after Widow's assassination attempt failed and resulted in her death. Spider-Man almost killed Captain America, but the Wasp convinced him not after learning that Black Widow had tried to kill Rogers so that Miles wouldn't.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 7}} When the contingent of super heroes launched a final attack on Hydra, the Red Room was freed by [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady (LMD) (Earth-616)|Black Ant]], who decided to switch sides in light of Hydra's eventual defeat. The Champions were reunited during the final battle,{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 9}} which saw the return of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|the real Captain America]] and fall of Hydra.{{r|Secret Empire Vol 1 10}}\n\n===Worlds Colliding===\nThe Champions next saw themselves forced into an uneasy alliance with the Avengers{{r|Avengers Vol 1 672}}{{r|Champions Vol 2 13}} to stop the [[Herbert Wyndham (Earth-616)|High Evolutionary]] from causing a collision between the [[Earth]] and his [[Counter-Earth (High Evolutionary)|Counter-Earth]]. After being turned into an ordinary human by the High Evolutionary,{{r|Avengers Vol 1 673}}{{r|Champions Vol 2 14}} Viv became trapped in another plane of existence while operating a device to foil the villain's plans. The Vision built a [[Vivian 2.0 (Synthezoid) (Earth-616)|Viv 2.0]] to cope with Viv's apparent death before Viv found her way home.{{r|Champions Vol 2 15}} The two twins co-existed for a brief time until Viv 2.0 went haywire and Viv killed her in self-defense.{{r|Champions Vol 2 17}} The Vision and the Wasp managed to rebuild her body, but couldn't bring back her mind. As a way to both regain her powers and ensure her sister lived on through herself, Viv transferred her consciousness to Viv 2.0's body.{{r|Champions Vol 2 18}} During this time, the Champions refrained from welcoming Viv 2.0 into the team taking into account Viv's feelings, and decided instead to invite Ironheart, Patriot, the Falcon, and burgeoning new hero the [[Fernanda Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Locust]], to compensate for their diminished manpower.{{r|Champions Vol 2 16}} Following Viv's return to the team, Cyclops saw himself forced to leave the Champions due to a call to arms from his fellow [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|time-displaced X-Men]].{{r|Champions Vol 2 18}}\n\nAfter joining the ranks of the Champions full-time, Ironheart and the Wasp helped Amadeus Cho create the [[Champions Mobile Bunker]] (C.M.B.), a new moving headquarters equipped with a command center plugged into worldwide news to facilitate the team's response to crises. During an investigation in [[Nunavut]], [[Canada]],{{r|Champions Vol 2 19}} the Champions stumbled into the machinations of [[Eshu (Earth-616)|Eshu, the Master of the World]],{{r|Champions Vol 2 20}} and uncovered his capture of a local teenager named [[Amka Aliyak (Earth-616)|Amka Aliyak]], who had become infused with the [[Inua]] spirit [[Sila (Earth-616)|Sila]], from whom Eshu was leeching off energy for his machinery. Amka escaped from Eshu's captivity, and joined the Champions, using the shapeshifting powers bestowed upon her by Sila to become the super hero Snowguard.{{r|Champions Vol 2 21}}\n\nThe Champions became involved in an attempt of the [[Warbringer (Earth-616)|Warbringer]] to cull his fellow [[Chitauri]] for serving [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] after Nova was alerted of the Warbringer's assault on the [[Nova Corps (Earth-616)|Nova Corps]] on his way to [[Chitauri Prime]]. Since Thanos had no interest in saving his minions, and because regular Chitauri possess no will of their own, they didn't defend themselves to the Warbringer's slaughter.{{r|Infinity Countdown: Champions Vol 1 1}} The Champions saw themselves forced to fight the Warbringer's army to save lives until Nova knocked out the villain. In the aftermath of the battle, Ironheart tried to confront Thanos, but was swiftly subdued and had [[Ironheart Armor Model 2|her armor]] destroyed, leaving her traumatized. When the team took Warbringer to the Nova Corps, [[Scott Adsit (Earth-616)|Commander Scott Adsit]] confiscated [[Nova Helmet (Supernovas)|his helmet]] since he was not an officially-recognized Nova.{{r|Infinity Countdown: Champions Vol 1 2}} Losing the source of his powers, Sam saw himself forced to step out of the front lines and become depressed. While still reeling from Thanos' attack, Riri designed her [[Ironheart Armor Model 3|Mk 3 Armor]]. During this period, Amadeus underwent his own major change, having become partially depowered and renaming himself \"Brawn.\"{{r|Champions Vol 2 22}}\n\n===Champions of Weirdworld===\nWhile helping a [[Tanzania]]n village suffering of water poisoning, the Champions discovered the [[Theodore Sallis (Earth-11234)|Man-Thing]] inhabiting their swamp. Affected by Viv's bottled-up fear from her recent traumas, the creature instinctively opened the [[Nexus of All Realities]], sending Sam and the Wasp to the otherworldly [[Weirdworld (Battleworld)|Weirdworld]].{{r|Champions Vol 2 23}} The two were later tracked down by the Master of the World, who had been keeping an eye on the Champions. He found Sam and Wasp amnesiac and mutated by Weirdworld's magic.{{r|Champions Vol 2 26}} Eshu took them under his wing and used Sam's ability to harness power from energy crystals to become a conqueror.{{r|Champions Vol 2 27}}\n\n[[File:Champions Vol 2 25 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|The Champions in Weirdworld]]\nThe rest of the Champions ventured into Weirdworld to find their teammates using the [[Siege Parallel]], a magical amulet granted to Snowguard by Sila for this mission. They were scattered over the magical realm, having their appearance, identities and past history rewritten in the process. Ms. Marvel became the sorceress Mystic Marvel, Spider-Man became the stealthy rogue Shadow-Spider, Brawn became the barbaric orc Brawnhammer, Viv became the crystal-powered golem Vivid Vessel, Snowguard became the rebel freedom fighter Snowgore, and Ironheart became the virtuous paladin Lady Ironheart. Only Riri remembered her previous life,{{r|Champions Vol 2 25}} and managed to reunite with her teammates. The Champions confronted Eshu, the now self-proclaimed Master of Weirdworld, and stopped him from stealing a trove of crystals from the [[New Crystalium (Earth-616)|New Crystalium]] which would have enabled him to exert his will on Weirdworld. During the fight, Ironheart and Viv combined their wills to harness the power of the crystals to return themselves and their teammates to normalcy. Afterwards, Riri managed to snap Sam out of Eshu's influence, and he relinquished his power. Eshu escaped during the confusion, and the Man-Thing returned the Champions home.{{r|Champions Vol 2 27}}\n\n===Champions Worldwide===\nChampions started operating globally after giving full membership to [[Joaqu\u00edn Torres (Earth-616)|Falcon]], [[Rayshaun Lucas (Earth-616)|Patriot]], [[Fernanda Rodriguez (Earth-616)|Locust]], [[Lana Baumgartner (Earth-1610)|Bombshell]], [[Qureshi Gupta (Earth-616)|Pinpoint]] and [[V\u00edctor \u00c1lvarez (Earth-616)|Power Man]].{{r|Champions Vol 3 1}} When the Champions were fighting Zzzax, Ms. Marvel and Viv Vision were killed in the process. [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] arrived and offered to rewind back time in to save their teammates. Miles accepted Mephisto's offer, and the demon reversed time resurrecting their dead teammates but unwittingly allowing a girl he saved previously die. This led to Spider-Man quitting the team.{{r|Champions Vol 3 2}}\n\n[[File:Champions (Earth-616) from Champions Vol 4 9 001.jpg|thumb|left|From left to right upside down: Brawn, Patriot, Power Man, Dust, Spider-Man, Ms. Marvel, Viv Vision, Nova, Ironheart, Starling, Snowguard, Falcon, Bombshell, Wasp, Locust, Pinpoint.]]\nViv Vision led Brawn, Snowguard and Falcon to deal with an anti-mutant riot in Manhattan, where [[Sooraya Qadir (Earth-616)|Dust]] was already present. Sam Alexander was piloting the hovering Champions Mobile Bunker which seems to have been hit by something. This seems to have dispelled the rioters. They were attacked by [[Kaldera (Earth-616)|Kaldera]] with whom Sam left the team to find his helmet as Kaldera desired true fight with him as Nova and Sam can retrieve his helmet.{{r|Champions Vol 3 4}} While Brawn and the Wasp started working simultaneously with [[Agents of Atlas (Earth-616)|Agents of Atlas]]{{r|Agents of Atlas Vol 3 1}} and [[Genius In action Research Labs (Earth-616)|G.I.R.L.]]{{r|Unstoppable Wasp Vol 1 2}} respectively.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Realms]], the Champions fought with Rock Trolls in Australia. Meanwhile, Power Man and Pinpoint meet [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] while transporting supplies for X-Men, who hadn't expected them. Cyclops was surprised to learn that they were Champions and took charge in leading the Champions against the Rock Trolls. Cyclops revealed to Ms. Marvel that his younger self's memories were merged with his own and gave her the inspiration to take control of the team. Ms. Marvel asked Dust, who had allied herself with the Champions to join them after Cyclops vouched for her.{{r|Champions Vol 3 4|5}}\n\nCyclops went back to Queens while the Champions went to [[S\u00e3o Paulo (State)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] to defend it from [[D\u00edsir (Earth-616)|D\u00edsir]], who have taken control over South America. Champions started fighting them, D\u00edsir's leader [[Br\u00fcn (Earth-616)|Br\u00fcn]] attacked Ms. Marvel but Power Man sacrifice himself but he instead he draw Chi from D\u00edsir and Champions managed to defeat them.{{r|Champions Vol 3 6}} Meanwhile, Sam and Kaldera found Commander Scott Adsit and learned the helmet had been stolen by the Thieves Guild of New York and returned to Earth. Sam managed to find helmet and rejoined Champions as Nova before imprisoning Kaldera to Nova Corps. {{r|Champions Vol 3 7|8}}\n\nBeing held by Mephisto, [[Blackheart (Earth-616)|Blackheart]] became privy to his father's latest scheme and begun corrupting members of the Champions, starting with Ironheart, who had been pushing away Viv due to the synthezoid apparently having feelings for her.{{r|Infinity Countdown: Champions Vol 1 2}}{{r|Champions Vol 3 8}} Spider-Man rejoined the team to help his friends. He, along with Ms. Marvel, also revealed their identities to Nova in order to free him from Blackheart's corruption. Blackheart, tried to use the deal that Miles made with Mephisto but Riri snapped out of his control due to Viv's affection and attacked him. Miles and Amadeus also let go of their guilt from Mephisto's deal. The Champions freed their teammates, united to defeat Blackheart, who was taken down by his father since he ruined his plans.{{r|Champions Vol 3 9|10}}\n\n| Equipment               = Each member's personal equipment.\n| Transportation          = Pinpoint's Portal;{{r|Champions Vol 3 1}}; [[Champions Mobile Bunker|C.M.B.]];{{r|Champions Vol 2 19}} formerly [[Cho's Meat Wagon]],{{r|Champions Vol 2 1}}{{r|Champions Vol 2 7}} a jet,{{r|Champions Vol 2 3|4}} and a truck.\n| Weapons                 = Each member's personal weapons.\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * In {{cl|Champions Vol 3 1}}, [[Vivian (Synthezoid) (Earth-616)|Viv]] is listing the members of the Champions Reinforcement Roster when she is cut off by [[Miles Morales (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] before she can finish mentioning a character whose name starts with \"S.\" Writer [[Jim Zub]] had no actual character in mind.
