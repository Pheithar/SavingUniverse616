Some of the members of S.H.E. were killed by [[Void (Dark Sentry) (Earth-616)|the Void]], but the organization survived and the affected nations chose new super-powered individuals to represent them in S.H.E.{{r|Sentry Vol 1 4}}\n\n===Civil War===\nDuring the height of the Civil War, the behavioral protocols within the nanites [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] was using to control [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] were tampered with, causing Osborn to slaughter a 20-man [[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantean]] sleeper cell that had been activated in [[New York City]]. In order to avert a military confrontation, S.H.E. brokered a deal between the Atlantean delegations led by [[Govan (Earth-616)|Ambassador Govan]] would hold a conference on the Lower East Side Wharf in order to air their grievances in a public forum in accordance with Atlantean custom.{{r|Civil War: Front Line Vol 1 8}}\n\nWales' new [[Red Dragon (SHE) (Earth-616)|Red Dragon]] was authorized by the State Department to act as a mediator while the [[Marcel Deflandre (Earth-616)|Belgian Brain]] was slated to serve as translator for the event; however, as soon as the conference started, Norman Osborn emerged from the crowd and shot Ambassador Govan, causing him to retreat into the waters with his Atlantean delegation. Norman was quickly subdued by [[Gunnar (SHE) (Earth-616)|Gunnar]] and placed in police custody.{{r|Civil War: Front Line Vol 1 8}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Some of S.H.E.'s members were identified/named for the first time in {{cl|Civil War: Battle Damage Report Vol 1 1}} and {{cl|Marvel Atlas Vol 1 1}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/shesentry.htm\n* http://www.marvel.com/universe/S.H.E.\n}}"
