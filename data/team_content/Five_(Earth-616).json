During this process of mutant resurrection, Egg produces a number of nonviable biological \"eggs,\" equal to the number of mutants the Five have to resurrect. The eggs are then injected with mutant DNA from Mister Sinister's genetic catalogue, and then made viable thanks to Proteus' reality-altering powers. Elixir biologically gives the eggs life starting a new cellular replication process and husk growth, and then Eva Bell uses her time manipulation powers to quickly age the mutant husks. Hope Summers uses her powers to enhance everyone else's abilities. Hope's powers allow the Five to operate at both their peak and in unison. A telepath then copies over the mutant's consciousness, recorded by Cerebro, from a copy made at the time of their deaths, onto the husk. Through this process, the Five are effectively able to make new clones of deceased mutants, restoring their bodies, their powers, and their minds as they were at the time of their deaths.<!-- {{r|House of X Vol 1 5}} -->\n\nThe more the Five practiced their resurrections, the easier the process became. Also, these five mutants appeared to become an inseparable family unit and were almost never seen apart from one another. Their connection appeared to have extended beyond the union of their powers, reaching the mutants themselves. On Krakoa, the Five were considered sacred and were to be protected at all costs.<!-- {{r|House of X Vol 1 5}} -->\n\nBecause the powers of Proteus were directly associated with the destruction of his own body, The Five had a backup mutant husk prepared for Proteus to inhabit when he burned out his old one. Depending on the frequency with which he used his powers, a Proteus body normally lasted one week, or even a single day during periods of excessive power use.<!-- {{r|House of X Vol 1 5}} -->\n\nXavier tasked the Five with resurrecting [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]], [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]], [[Paige Guthrie (Earth-616)|Husk]], [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Archangel]], [[Monet St. Croix (Earth-616)|Penance]], [[Raven Darkholme (Earth-616)|Mystique]], [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], and [[Kurt Wagner (Earth-616)|Nightcrawler]] who died destroying the [[Mother Mold (Earth-616)|Mother Mold]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}\n\nThe Five had previously resurrected other long deceased mutants, such as [[Sean Cassidy (Earth-616)|Banshee]], as well as [[Sophie Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Sophie]] and [[Esme Cuckoo (Earth-616)|Esme Cuckoo]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe Five were seen partying following the recognition of Krakoa as a sovereign nation by the [[United Nations (Earth-616)|United Nations]] and the first meeting of the [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council]].{{r|House of X Vol 1 6}}{{r|Powers of X Vol 1 6}}\n\nDue to the complexities of discerning who is dead, missing, or simply displaced, so there won't be multiple versions of the same mutant alive at once, the formation of [[X-Factor Investigations (Earth-616)|X-Factor]] was approved. X-Factor Investigations would confirm the whereabouts and status of missing and potentially deceased mutants, and inform the Five on their findings so they could start the resurrection process.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 1}}\n\nThe resurrection protocols were briefly shut down when [[Santo Vaccarro (Earth-616)|Rockslide]] was brought back from his death on [[Otherworld]] with his [[Santo Vaccarro (Multiverse)|mind scrambled]]. It was concluded by The Quiet Council and X-Factor Investigations that mutants who die on Otherworld can't be brought back.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 4}} After [[Opal Luna Saturnyne (Earth-9)|Saturnyne]]'s [[X of Swords|Ten of Swords]] tournament ended, resurrections were resumed.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 7}}\n\n| Equipment               =\n* '''[[Resurrection Protocols]]'''\n* '''[[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebros]]'''\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The [[Quiet Council of Krakoa (Earth-616)|Quiet Council]] and the [[Five (Earth-616)|Five]] agreed that clones such as [[Madelyne Pryor (Earth-616)|Madelyne Pryor]] can't be resurrected due to the similarities to their progenitor.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 4}}\n** The Five broke this rule by resurrecting [[Gabrielle Kinney (Earth-616)|Gabby Kinney]] and afterwards filed a formal request to the Council to change this ruling, arguing that Cerebro registered these \"clones\" as individuals separate from their genetic originals, and that they therefore deserved resurrection.{{r|New Mutants Vol 4 21}}\n* Due to [[Otherworld]]'s connection to the entirety of the [[Multiverse]], mutants that die there cannot be restored to their original selves. The first attempt to do so resulted in the resurrected mutant being transformed into [[Santo Vaccarro (Multiverse)|an amalgamation of their multiversal counterparts]], drawing on enough energy to temporarily shut down all five [[Cerebro (Mutant Detector)|Cerebros]] and the Five's connection, and corrupting the copy/essence of the mutant's mind in Cerebro.{{r|House of X Vol 1 5}}{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 4}}\n* The Five need a telepath and Cerebro in conjunction with the resurrection process to implant the essence of the newly created husk to complete the process.{{r|X-Factor Vol 4 4}} Hope eventually learned how to do this herself, though needs to tap into another mutant's telepathic powers. {{r|Inferno Vol 2 2}} \n* If a member of the five dies themselves, Sync and Mimic are on reserve to fill their role during their resurrection.{{r|X-Men Vol 5 5}}\n* If a mutant dies on [[Amenth]] they will be brought back in an enhanced form, with their powers and skills honed and their personality slightly altered.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 7}}\n\n\n| Links                   = * [[Resurrection Protocols]]\n* [[Force Warriors (Earth-11326)|Force Warriors]]\n* [[Phoenix Five (Earth-616)|Phoenix Five]]\n* [[Lights (Earth-616)|Five Lights]]\n}}\n[[Category:Cloners]]\n[[Category:Resurrection]]\n[[Category:Mutant Culture]]"
