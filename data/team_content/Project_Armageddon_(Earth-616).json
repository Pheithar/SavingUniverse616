By experimenting on the subject known as Beatrice, the program yielded multiple subjects, notably [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]], but all proved to be failures until program yielded a successful subject in the form of [[Lazarus (Domino's Brother) (Earth-616)|Lazarus]].{{r|Domino Vol 2 4}}\n| Equipment               = [[Sentinel MK III]]{{r|X-Men #98|99}}\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:American Organizations]]\n[[Category:Super-Soldier Programs]]"
