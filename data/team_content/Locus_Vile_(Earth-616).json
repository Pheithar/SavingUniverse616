Tarn had the ability to manipulate the mutations of others. The process was deadly, but those who survived became members of the Locus Vile and worshipped him as a god. The Vile were hated and feared throughout Amenth and sought to usher Tarn to new lands, where he might use his powers to pervert living creatures, a process he considered sacred. {{r|Hellions Vol 1 6}}\n\nThe Vile were encountered by the [[Hellions (Essex) (Earth-616)|Hellions]] who were tricked to journey to [[Amenth]] as part of a scheme by [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Mister Sinister]] to capture the genetic data of Arakko's mutants. They first encountered Tarn, who agreed to show Sinister his pet mutants, only for Sinister to unleash several robotic mosquitos that gathered the DNA of Tarn and the Vile. Enraged by this, Tarn ordered his Vile to kill Sinister and the Hellions. The Vile made short work of them, but Sinister sent the surviving Hellions back through the gate to [[Otherworld]] to escape with the DNA he gathered.{{r|Hellions Vol 1 6}} The clone of Sinister that had accompanied the Hellions was captured by Tarn. The clone was tortured by Tarn and the Vile and forced to submit to his will. {{r|Hellions Vol 1 13}} \n\nAfter the defeat of Amenth in [[X of Swords|Saturnyne's Sword Contest]], and the subsequent relocation of Arakko first to [[Earth]] and then to [[Mars (Planet)|Mars]], Tarn raised the issue of Sinister's robbery of Vile's genes during a meeting of the [[Great Ring of Arakko (Earth-616)|Great Ring of Arakko]]. The Ring forbade Tarn from interfering with the mutants of [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoa]], but after his Vile located Sinister and the Hellions, he broke his promise and led them into an ambush of Sinister and the Hellions to retrieve the stolen DNA. {{r|Hellions Vol 1 13}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
