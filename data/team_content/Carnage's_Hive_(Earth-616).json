Infecting the populace and several feral animals with offshoots of his symbiote, Dark Carnage then sent them to hunt down former symbiote-hosts.{{r|Web of Venom: Unleashed Vol 1 1}}\n\n===[[Absolute Carnage|First Rampage]]===\n[[File:Carnage's Hive (Earth-616) from Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1 001.png|thumb|left|The original iteration.]]\nTravelling to [[Doverton]], Carnage infected [[Eric Morrell (Earth-616)|Eric Morrell]] with a piece of his symbiote before sacrificing him to Knull. [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]] attempted to intervene, but was also infected and turned into a sleeper agent,{{r|Web of Venom: Cult of Carnage Vol 1 1}} capturing [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] and imprisoning her in the [[Ravencroft Institute]].{{r|Absolute Carnage: Lethal Protectors Vol 1 1}} Making his way to New York, Dark Carnage began infecting animals and homeless people, establishing a second Spire underneath Grand Street.{{r|Venom Vol 4 15}}{{r|Fantastic Four Vol 6 11}}{{r|Black Cat #2}}{{r|Avengers Vol 8 22}} Using Knull's power, Dark Carnage corrupted the [[Hybrid (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Hybrid symbiote]] - which seperated into the [[Agony (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Agony]], [[Lasher (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Lasher]], [[Phage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Phage]], and [[Riot (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Riot]] symbiotes - and sent them after [[Norman Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Normie Osborn]].{{r|Absolute Carnage: Separation Anxiety Vol 1 1}}{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 17}}-[[Venom Vol 4 18|18]]}}\n\nWhen he was finally ready, Dark Carnage attacked [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]] and his son [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan]] - who managed to escape when the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]] rebonded to Eddie.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}} Dark Carnage had Jameson slaughter the guards stationed at the Ravencroft Institute, arranging a trap for Venom and [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] should they try to rescue [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]].{{r|Absolute Carnage: Lethal Protectors Vol 1 1}} Springing his trap, Cletus broke into Ravencroft and infected the inmates with pieces of his symbiote, turning most of them into a horde of four-armed Carnage Doppelg\u00e4ngers.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}} With his shock troops now ready, Dark Carnage infected Osborn with [[Carnage V (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a piece of his symbiote]] to turn him back into Carnage.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}} Unleashing his horde across the city,{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 2}} Dark Carnage took Ravencroft as his base of operations, inducted the remaining inmates into the symbiote-worshiping cult, and resurrected [[Demogoblin (Earth-616)|Demogoblin]] using [[Frances Barrison (Earth-616)|Shriek]] as a sacrifice.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Lethal Protectors Vol 1 1}} \n\nWhen [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] burnt the institute to the ground, Dark Carnage relocated his base of operations to the Spire under Grand Street. Over the next several hours, Dark Carnage unleashed his army into the city, directing them to devour civilians or infect them with pieces of his symbiote to swell his ranks.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Avengers Vol 1 1}} Dark Carnage resurrected the [[Scream (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Scream symbiote]] to serve as one of his generals, sending her after [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Andi Benton]].{{r|Absolute Carnage: Scream Vol 1 1}} Sending Osborn after [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Scorpion]] resulted in [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Miles Morales]] being taken over by [[Character Index/Unnamed Symbiotes#Miles Morales' Symbiote|an offshoot of the Dark Carnage symbiote]], turning him into a unique six-armed Carnage Doppelg\u00e4nger.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 3}} Man-Wolf, Miles, and Scream broke free of Dark Carnage's control,{{r|Absolute Carnage: Lethal Protectors Vol 1 3}}{{r|Absolute Carnage: Miles Morales Vol 1 3}}{{r|Absolute Carnage: Scream Vol 1 3}} though Miles succumbed to his symbiote once again.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 4}} Despite taking over the [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]], Hybrid was seemingly killed by Dylan Brock, [[Sleeper (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Sleeper]], and [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 19}}\n\nOnce the heroes had regrouped and established a base of operations at Rex Strickland's warehouse, using [[Symbiote Codex Isolation and Thermo-Heated Extraction|a machine to non-lethally extract codices]], Dark Carnage infiltrated it disguised as Eddie Brock before summoning his horde to crush those who opposed him and claim the remaining codices. Out of desperation, the Venom symbiote bonded to [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Bruce Banner]] and unleashed his Savage Hulk persona, though Dark Carnage defeated him and assimilated the Venom symbiote - apotheosizing into an even more powerful form. Miles was freed from his symbiote by Eddie, who bonded to the codices extracted by the Maker's machine and amalgamated them into [[Venom III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a gestalt symbiote]].{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 4}}\n\nAs Venom battled the apotheosized Dark Carnage, Spider-Man defeated Norman Osborn with help from the demon [[Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Kindred]];{{r|{{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 30}}-[[Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 31|31]]}} and Dylan seemingly destroyed Osborn's offshoot of the Dark Carnage symbiote. With re-enforcements turning the tide against Dark Carnage's horde, Dark Carnage forced Venom to kill him in order to save Dylan - thereby unleashing Knull from [[Klyntar (Location)|Klyntar]]. With Dark Carnage's death, his symbiote was absorbed into Venom and the offshoots seemingly perished, freeing their hosts.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5}}\n\n===[[Extreme Carnage|Return of the Bleeding King]]===\nDespite the death of his physical body, Cletus' consciousness was stored in the Symbiote Hive as a codex and was able to pilot the Dark Carnage symbiote due to their uniquely strong bond.{{r|Extreme Carnage Alpha Vol 1 1}} Assimilating the Venom symbiote into the Dark Carnage symbiote, Carnage attempted to take over Eddie Brock but was stopped by Dylan.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 21}}-[[Venom Vol 4 25|25]]}} Carnage survived Dylan's attempt to destroy him and bonded to a shark, prowling the ocean for several months before taking a new human host and attempting to take part in [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]'s [[King in Black (Event)|attempted conquest]] of Earth. At that moment, Eddie Brock vanquished Knull and became the new King in Black, granting him some of Knull's divine power and making him the nexus of the Symbiote Hive. Controlling dozens of symbiotes, Eddie sentenced Carnage to execution and directed the symbiotes to devour him, but a piece of the symbiote survived.{{r|Carnage: Black, White & Blood Vol 1 2}}\n\nPiloting the surviving piece of the Dark Carnage symbiote, Cletus slowly made his way back to New York - restoring the symbiote by devouring everyone he came across en route. Inspired by what Eddie had done, Cletus formulated a new plan to make a comeback using the power Knull had bequeathed him to create a rival Hive with himself as its nexus. Once back in Manhattan, Carnage infiltrated the xenophobic [[Friends of Humanity (Earth-616)|Friends of Humanity]] organization and began to infect many of the symbiotes left behind on Earth with his will. However, Carnage's failed attempt to corrupt the [[Anti-Venom III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom symbiote]] alerted [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Flash Thompson]] and [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] to his return.{{r|Extreme Carnage Alpha Vol 1 1}} Carnage subsequently corrupted the [[Phage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Phage]],{{r|Extreme Carnage: Phage Vol 1 1}} [[Lasher (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Lasher]],{{r|Extreme Carnage: Lasher Vol 1 1}} and [[Scream (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Scream]] symbiotes;{{r|Extreme Carnage: Scream Vol 1 1}} although the latter was killed by its host, [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Andi Benton]]. When Carnage sent Phage to assassinate Andi, she bonded to a new symbiote, [[Silence (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Silence]], and used its [[Astrobiological Serum|Anti-Venom]]-derived cleansing touch to sever it from the Hive.{{r|Extreme Carnage: Phage Vol 1 1}}{{r|Extreme Carnage: Lasher Vol 1 1}} Carnage attempted to corrupt the [[Toxin (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Toxin symbiote]], demanding it kill its host [[Bren Waters (Earth-616)|Bren Waters]], but it refused and repelled him, subsequently broaching an alliance with Silence and Agent Anti-Venom. Carnage next corrupted the [[Riot (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Riot symbiote]] and directed it to [[Washington, D.C.]], and sent the corrupted [[Agony (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Agony symbiote]] and its host to spy on [[Character Index/H#Hank|Hank]], a veteran who Agent Anti-Venom had sent to spy on Senator Krane as one of his bodyguards - and assassinate him if need-be.{{r|Extreme Carnage: Riot Vol 1 1}}{{r|Extreme Carnage: Toxin Vol 1 1}}\n\nCarnage's plot proved successful, as he was able to assassinate Senator Krane on live television, directing Agony, Phage, and Lasher to slaughter the assembled civilians. Riot was vanquished by [[Sleeper (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Sleeper]], who had secretly bonded to Hank. Silence, Toxin, and Sleeper assisted the surviving civilians in escaping; battling Agony, Lasher, and Phage until a squad of Guardsmen sent to back them up arrived to capture the corrupted symbiotes. Agent Anti-Venom's battle with Carnage was interrupted by Iron Man, who separated the Carnage symbiote from Arthur Krane - unmasked as a sociopathic serial killer - using his [[Extrembiote (Earth-616)|Extrembiote armor]]. However, Carnage hijacked control of the Extrembiote and almost killed Tony, assimilating the Extrembiote into the Carnage symbiote to become a symbiote-dragon. Gloating that he was victorious, Carnage freed Agony and abandoned Lasher, Phage, and Riot to be separated from their hosts and imprisoned in Alchemax's astrobiology lab.<!--{{r|Extreme Carnage Omega Vol 1 1}}-->\n\nWhile Arthur Krane succeeded his late father as senator - which he had plotted to do even before bonding to Carnage - and the Friends of Humanity were more popular than ever, he had grown addicted to the power he'd wielded with the symbiote and begged Gemma Shin - who'd been sent to act as Carnage's emissary - to help him get it back; Gemma agreeing in exchange for his fealty to Carnage's cause.{{r|Extreme Carnage Omega Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Carnage's horde fights mainly with their fangs, claws, and tendrils; using their sheer numbers to overwhelm foes.\n\n| Notes                   = * The Carnage Doppelg\u00e4ngers seem to have been based on the [[Outriders (Race)|Outriders]] and [[Doppelganger (Spider-Man) (Earth-616)|Doppelganger]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Symbiote-Enhanced Organizations]]"
