Frost had plans to create cybernetically enhanced soldiers using animals. Multicorp hoped to use the team as its own private attack force.{{r|Brute Force Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe prototype team [[Heavy Metal (Animals) (Earth-616)|Heavy Metal]] was abducted by \"fast food clowns,\" so Multicorp create Brute Force to retrieve them.{{r|Brute Force Vol 1 1}}\n \nAnother of the subjects in the program was designated [[Weapon II (Earth-616)|Weapon II]], he was a cybernetically enhanced squirrel with Wolverine like claws. He was captured by [[Shannon Sugarbaker (Earth-616)|Shannon Sugarbaker]] to be used in her hunting tournament of anthropomorphic animals.{{r|Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol 2 6}}\n\n[[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]] and [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] investigated an abandoned Weapon Plus site where they found the team kept in hibernation tanks full of liquid. The [[Wreckless (Earth-616)|bear]] was freed from his container and attacked the duo. It was revealed he was being mind controlled by another super-soldier, \"[[Adam (Weapon VI Upgrade) (Earth-616)|Adam]].\" The two heroes were forced to kill the bear in the process.{{r|Wolverine & Captain America: Weapon Plus Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = Cybernetic suits\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Lasers\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Weapon Plus Projects]]\n[[Category:Super-Soldier Programs]]\n[[Category:Weapon Plus (Earth-616)/Members]]"
