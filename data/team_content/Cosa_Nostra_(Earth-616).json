It consisted of various independent criminal families, all of them Italian. Originally the Mafia had its hands in everything until RICO started cutting its way through the organization, along with the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]]. Cosa Nostra lost control of their cities and became just another gang, fighting for turf. It was an organization with branches in both [[Italy]] and the [[United States]].{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 14}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 11}} It used to have a \"Commission\" which the families had to go to for authorization to carry out hits against members of other Mafia families.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 54}}\n\nOf all the organized crime groups operating in the United States, it's \"La Cosa Nostra\" which has been attacked most often and effectively by the Punisher. It has also been the most conservative of the major organized criminal societies, none of the factions possessed cutting-edge technology comparable to that of [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] or [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]], unlike the [[Triads (Earth-616)|Triads]] (e.g. the [[Celestial Order of the Si-Fan (Earth-616)|Si-Fan]] and [[Inner Demons (Earth-616)|Inner Demons]]), the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] (e.g. the [[Nefaria Family (Earth-616)|Nefaria Family]]), or the [[Yakuza (Earth-616)|Yakuza]] (e.g. the [[Shogun Reapers (Earth-616)|Shogun Reapers]]). Nor were any Mafia families known for having super-powered members or teams of super-powered operatives, unlike the aforementioned groups. They have not had ninja clans at their disposal unlike some factions of the [[Yakuza (Earth-616)|Yakuza]] (e.g. the [[Clan Yashida (Earth-616)|Yashida]] and [[Yamaguchi-gumi (Earth-616)|Yamaguchi-gumi]]) and to a lesser degree the [[Triads (Earth-616)|Triads]] (e.g the Si-Fan) and the [[Cartels (Earth-616)|Cartels]] (e.g. [[Tarantula's Organization (Earth-616)|Tarantula's Organization]]). Nor have any of the Mafia families possessed paramilitary armies equipped with military combat vehicles and artillery, unlike the [[Cartels (Earth-616)|Cartels]] and to a lesser degree the [[Molina (Earth-616)|Molina]] (e.g. the [[Solntsevskaya Bratva (Earth-616)|Solntsevskaya Bratva]]).\n\n===Mafia Groups===\n* [[Tri-State Crime Syndicate (Earth-616)|Tri-State Crime Syndicate]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Outfit (Earth-616)|The Outfit]]\n* [[Paguro Family (Earth-616)|Paguro Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Carbone Crime Family (Earth-616)|Carbone Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Rossi Crime Family (Earth-616)|Rossi Family]]\n* [[Patrillo Crime Family (Earth-616)|Patrillo Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Napolitano Family (Earth-616)|Napolitano Family]]\n* [[Camorra Family (Earth-616)|Camorra Family]]\n* [[Montenegri Crime Family (Earth-616)|Montenegri Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Genovese Crime Family (Earth-616)|Genovese Family]]\n* [[Depanini Family (Earth-616)|Depanini Family]]\n* [[Bessucho Family (Earth-616)|Bessucho Family]]\n* [[Vaducci Crime Family (Earth-616)|Vaducci Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Nobili Family (Earth-616)|Nobili Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Pazzo Family (Earth-616)|Pazzo Family]]\n* [[Gnucci Crime Family (Earth-616)|Gnucci Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Lozaros Family (Earth-616)|Lozaros Family]]\n* [[Mecozzi Family (Earth-616)|Mecozzi Family]]\n* [[Geraci Crime Family (Earth-616)|Geraci Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Rosettis Family (Earth-616)|Rosettis Family]]\n* [[Destefanis Family (Earth-616)|Destefanis Family]]\n* [[Corvelli Crime Family (Earth-616)|Corvelli Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Gambello Family (Earth-616)|Gambello Family]]\n* [[Oliveri Family (Earth-616)|Oliveri Family]]\n* [[Torrino Crime Family (Earth-616)|Torrino Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Ripa Family (Earth-616)|Ripa Family]]\n* [[Frittoli Crime Family (Earth-616)|Frittoli Family]]\n* [[Sanguino Family (Earth-616)|Sanguino Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Gambisi Family (Earth-616)|Gambisi Family]] {{Defunct}}\n* [[Rinaldo Family (Earth-616)|Rinaldo Family]] {{Defunct}}\n\n===Crimelords===\n* [[Pops Paguro (Earth-616)|Pops]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Elio Bessucho (Earth-616)|Elio Bessucho]] \n* [[Ferruccio Bessucho (Earth-616)|Ferruccio Bessucho]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Rosalie Carbone (Earth-616)|Rosalie Carbone]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Julius Carbone (Earth-616)|Julius Carbone]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Morris Forelli (Earth-616)|Morris Forelli]]\n* [[Mario Geraci (Earth-616)|Mario Geraci]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Isabella Carmela Magdalena Gnucci (Earth-616)|Ma Gnucci]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Don Stilicho (Earth-616)|Don Stilicho]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Don Valerian (Earth-616)|Don Valerian]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Don Gambello (Earth-616)|Don Gambello]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Freddo Pazzo (Earth-616)|Freddo Pazzo]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Sal Pazzo (Earth-616)|Sal Prazzo]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Johnny Delacavva (Earth-616)|Johnny Delacavva]]\n* [[Salvatore Vischetti (Earth-616)|Don Salvatore Vischetti]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Roman (Earth-616)|Roman]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Don Parisi (Earth-616)|Don Parisi]]\n* [[Jimmy Sanguino (Earth-616)|Jimmy Sanguino]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Rico Gambisi (Earth-616)|Rico Gambisi]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Tony Rinaldo (Earth-616)|Tony Rinaldo]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Shorty Vansante (Earth-616)|Shorty Vansante]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Tommy Fabian (Earth-616)|Tommy Fabian]] {{Dead}}\n* [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Frank Castle]] (formerly)\n| Equipment               = communications satellite,{{r|Punisher: War Zone Vol 1 6}}\n| Transportation          = ship with helicopter landing pad,{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 26}}, gunboat (with a cannon),{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 26|27}}\n| Weapons                 = small-bore single-barrel cannon (on boat),{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 26|27}} anti-tank rocket,{{r|Punisher Vol 2 6}} man-portable heat-seeking missile,{{r|Punisher War Journal Vol 1 63}} and firearms (handguns, shotguns, assault rifles, etc)\n| Notes                   = In the Marvel Universe, both the [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] (Marvel's analog of the Mafia) and the Mafia (Cosa Nostra) exist. The Maggia appeared first, and later the Mafia appeared. Cosa Nostra has appeared mostly in the Punisher comics, and sometimes in Daredevil and Spider-Man comics.\n| Trivia                  = * The real American Mafia no longer dominates organized crime in the United States. Outside of the northeast (mainly NY City) and in Chicago (mostly the suburbs) where the Mafia is still strong, the criminal underworld is dominated by other groups and in many major cities the American Mafia no longer have a presence.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mafia|title=American Mafia|date=9 June 2020|accessdate=9 June 2020}}}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/d205853aca1e47c2816f8bb5b0300f30/The-last-Mafioso?-%27Cadillac-Frank%27-trial-shows-mob%27s-decline|title=The last Mafioso? \u2018Cadillac Frank\u2019 trial shows mob\u2019s decline|work=Associated Press|first=Alanna|last=Durkin Richer|date=17 June 2018|accessdate=9 June 2020}}}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/706895|title=The Rise and Fall of Organized Crime in the United States|work=University of Chicago Press|first=James|last=B.
