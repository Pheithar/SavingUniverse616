During the confrontation the [[Examiner (Earth-616)|Examiner]] murdered the Triad leader, [[Gow Yang Ju (Earth-616)|Gow Yang Ju]], framed the X-Men, and took leadership.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 5}} Afterwards, the X-Men were able to get proof that it was the Examiner who murdered Gow in a conspiracy with [[Sebastian Shaw (Earth-616)|Sebastian Shaw]] to take over not only the [[Triads (Earth-616)|Triads]], but also the other major crime syndicates in [[Australia]]. It was presented to the council of the Sydney Triad, who took the Examiner into custody, and informed the X-Men that the Triad was in its debt.{{r|X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 9}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Chinese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Triads]]"
