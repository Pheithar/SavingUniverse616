Autocron fleets are led by Admirals.{{r|Machine Man Vol 1 5}} It consists of a variety of starships, including cruisers and guardships.{{r|Machine Man Vol 1 6}}\n| History                 = An Autocron fleet in another galaxy received a transmission from an Autocron Rover, the Holocaust Specialist [[Ten-For (Earth-616)|Ten-For]] who was on [[Earth]]. Being a seasoned Rover, the admiral gave the order for the fleet to head to his destination.{{r|Machine Man Vol 1 5}} It soon appeared at the rim of Earth's [[Sol|Solar System]] and headed toward Earth. The [[Aaron Stack (Earth-616)|Machine Man]], having defeated Ten-For, turned him into a thermonuclear bomb via changes to his circuitry. He created a space-time portal and sent Ten-For through, setting a trap for the incoming fleet, which encountered the booby trap by [[Jupiter (Planet)|Jupiter]] and was destroyed by the explosion.{{r|Machine Man Vol 1 6}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Interstellar ships with warp drives\n| Weapons                 = likely directed energy weapons (like the Autocrons themselves)\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Interstellar Fleets]]\n[[Category:Alien Military Forces]]\n[[Category:Interplanetary Organizations]]"
