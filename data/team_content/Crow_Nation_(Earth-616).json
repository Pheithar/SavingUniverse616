Eventually, the Crow people were concentrated on a reservation in the state of Montana by the 19th Century.\n\nPresumably, their history is similar to that of that of their real world counterparts.\n\n===American Frontier===\nDuring the days of the American Frontier, various Crow tribes interacted with the various heroes active in the era, such as the [[Comanche Nation (Earth-616)|Comanche]] [[Red Warrior (Earth-616)|Red Warrior]]. Some of these interactions were as allies or enemies depending on the circumstances.\n\nA group of Crow braves almost started a war between the Crow and [[Grey Eagle (Earth-616)|Grey Eagle]]'s [[Comanche Nation (Earth-616)|Comanches]], but the conflict was abated thanks to peace talks initiated by [[Red Warrior (Earth-616)|Red Warrior]].{{r|Red Warrior #3}} Another tribe of Crow in Arizona were having their buffalo supply hunted by an outlaw named Fuller. Fuller framed the [[Preston Hardwick (Earth-616)|Gunhawk]] with the murder of some Crow warriors and he was taken prisoner by the tribe. Gunhawk was freed by a sympathetic warrior who believed in his innocence and the Gunhawk exposed the real killers.{{r|Gunhawk Vol 1 17}}\n\nLater a group of Crow people were sold weapons and whiskey by a man they called Smoking Lion. The man in reality was Jess Kruger the bigoted mayor of Carson City who sought to start a war between the Crow and the people of Carson City in the hopes of wiping out the tribe. However this plot was exposed and foiled by [[Blaine Colt (Earth-616)|Kid Colt]].{{r|Wild Western #31}} A gang of renegade Crow clashed with [[Pawnee People (Earth-616)|Pawnee]] renegade [[Arrowhead (Earth-616)|Arrowhead]] and the US Army.{{r|Wild Western #34}}\n\n===Modern Age===\n-----\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Native American Tribes]]"
