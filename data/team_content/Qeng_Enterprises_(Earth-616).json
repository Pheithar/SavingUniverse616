Mr. Gryphon recognized the language [[Warbringer (Earth-616)|Warbringer]] was speaking, and proposed becoming his ally; meanwhile, an eavesdropping [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Spider-Man]] listened as Warbringer was ultimately convinced to gather the scattered pieces of an ancient artifact, but Mr. Gryphon teleported away after the hero's presence was uncovered and the resultant explosion from Warbringer's attack caught the attention of Iron Man and [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 1}} He later reappeared on the scene, after the group of heroes had failed to stop Warbringer, scolding them for property damage to his newly acquired building.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 2}}\n\nAfter Warbringer got the heroes off Qeng Enterprises' trail, Mr. Gryphon returned to help him gather the final piece of the relic from a cemetery on [[Hart Island]]. Mr. Gryphon informed the warlord of the object's ability to open a portal for an awaiting [[Chitauri]] armada; however, the heroes managed to steal the artifact and force Warbringer through the portal, trapping him on a future [[Chitauri Prime]] as they destroyed the relic soon after, thwarting the villains' plans, and compelling Mr. Gryphon to regroup and focus on dismantling the newly reformed [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]].{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 3}}\n\nIn furtherance of this endeavor, Qeng Enterprises hired [[Chen Lu (Earth-616)|Radioactive Man]] to rob [[Manhattan]]'s [[Federal Reserve Bank of New York|Federal Reserve]], damaging the older team members' faith in the youth.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2015 Avengers}} Mr. Gryphon next employed [[Pierre Fresson (Earth-616)|Cyclone]] to attack [[Atlantic City]] in the ongoing effort to continually sow discord within the Avengers, using the corrupted Vision to further drive a wedge between the various members.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 4}}\n\nThe strife ultimately culminated in [[Kamala Khan (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] and [[Samuel Alexander (Earth-616)|Nova]] being kicked off the team just prior to an attack from [[Terrance Sorenson (Earth-616)|Equinox]] at [[High Line Park]], during which Mr. Gryphon revealed his connection to [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang the Conqueror]], summoning multiple Equinoxes from various alternate timelines.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 5}} Realizing that something was very wrong with Vision, Ms. Marvel and Nova rushed to the scene and helped Spider-Man incapacitate Equinox, thus momentarily preventing Mr. Gryphon from summoning future iterations and allowing Iron Man time to reboot Vision's systems, freeing him from Qeng Enterprises' control. [[Jane Foster (Earth-616)|Thor]] then ended the battle by striking a time-displaced [[Mjolnir]] against her own and creating a temporal paradox into which Mr. Gryphon was drawn.{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 6}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:Mark Waid/Creator]]\n[[Category:Adam Kubert/Creator]]"
