Tuskar, who had been Durgan's apprentice, decided to look independently for his missing master.{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 2}} While going sleuth, Tuskar entered a forbidden museum; there he videoconferenced with Durgan. Durgan told Tuskar that he had sent an agent, the [[Chief Examiner (Earth-616)|Chief Examiner]], to [[Earth|another planet]] to collect superpowers he was to use in [[Chief Exterminator (Earth-616)|a champion]]. Tuskar found the idea abhorrent and threatened to report to the Council; but Durgan convinced Tuskar to join him instead based on the fact that Tuskar had also broken the Council's rules during his investigation.{{r|Questprobe Vol 1 3}}\n\nScadam was flattened by the Black Fleet attack, its population almost extinguished.{{r|Quasar Vol 1 45}} It is reasonable to assume that the Ruling Council was dismantled.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
