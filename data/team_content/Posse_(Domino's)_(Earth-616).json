Her first recruit was [[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]], which meant they had stealth and impact covered, but still lacked muscle.<!-- {{r|Domino Annual Vol 1 1}} -->\n\nMeanwhile, Domino and Diamondback were hired to retrieve [[Sentinels]] tech which had been stolen by [[Professor Salvage (Earth-616)|Professor Salvage]] who had hired [[Inez Temple (Earth-616)|Outlaw]] to be his bodyguard. When they entered the local saloon, they found Outlaw, who had just won a big bar fight, and when Domino and Diamondback saw this, they decided it would be a good idea to add her to their team. The meeting between them did not start very well and resulted in a fight, but despite this rough start, they finally got her to listen to them. Shortly after explaining to Outlaw that Professor Salvage was anti-mutant, he decided to attack the saloon with a murder sport utility vehicle. It was then that Outlaw joined the posse and went on to battle against Professor Salvage with them.{{r|Domino Annual Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = [[Painted Lady|''The Painted Lady'']]\n| Weapons                 = [[Diamondback's Grenades]]\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
