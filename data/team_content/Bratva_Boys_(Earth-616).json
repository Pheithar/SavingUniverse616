Fortunately for the Bratva Boys, [[James Howlett (Earth-21923)|Logan]] was present at the bar drinking with [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Star-Lord]], and attacked the gang member ordered to begin the attack. However, the situation escalated to a bar fight. The Bravta Boys seemed to have fled the scene at some point while Logan and Star-Lord continued fighting Black Cat's gang.{{r|Star-Lord Vol 2 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Chip Zdarsky/Creator]]\n[[Category:Kris Anka/Creator]]\n[[Category:Molina]]\n[[Category:Russian Organizations]]"
