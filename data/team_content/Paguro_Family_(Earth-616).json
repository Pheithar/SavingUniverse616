That rule assured them that they stayed way off the radar.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 14}}\n* If they called, the criminals had to come immediately.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 14}}\n\nAs part of their service, the Paguros invited their clients for a party in their stronghold in [[South Bronx]], allegedly the safes place in [[Bronx]], each time a crazy event occurred in New York, providing booze, drugs and ladies.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 16}}\n\nFor years, they also offered a \"sizable\" bounty on the head of the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]].{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 17}}\n\nAmong the families helped were the [[Nobili Family (Earth-616)|Nobili Family]], who demonstrated only failing.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 14}}\n\n===Vs. the Punisher===\nAs he kept taking groups down, for having weak groups taking their places easily, the Punisher suspected the existence of contacts, suppliers, know-how, infrastructure.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 14}}\n\nTorturing criminals in order to obtain intel, he learned about them.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 14}}\n\nThe Paguros learned that the Punisher was on their trail, and set up a trap, from which he managed to escape.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 14}}\n\n===The End===\nAs part of [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]]'s [[Thunderbolts (Red Hulk) (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], like his teammates, the Punisher was granted one mission from the team for his own goals, and he decided to take down the Paguros.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 14}}\n\nAt that point, the Punisher had managed to identify three members of the Paguros, including \"Pops\" and Ferdinand.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 14}}\n\nAs the Nobili Family attempted to get support from the Paguros, they refused, and facing their insistence and incivility, had them beat up by their other clients.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 14}}\n\nThe Thunderbolts soon started to capture and interrogate criminals, without much results, until they found the Nobili who immediately gave up the location of the Paguros, glad to have to avenge themselves.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 15}}\n\nAround that moment, [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]]' armies started their invasion of New York, and the Paguros' clients went in hiding and partying in their bunker.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 16}}\n\nThe Nobili were soon running away from the battle, pursued by Thanos' ravagers, until they arrived to the Paguro stronghold, the only safe place in the [[Bronx]]. The Paguros shoot down the aliens but refused the Nobili entry, until Gordon mentioned that he had intel about the Punisher. Informed by Gordon and defiant of the Nobili's claims that they hadn't revealed the location of the stronghold, \"Pops\" decided to arm his guests in prevision, while the Punisher, [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Venom]] and [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]] took down their guards outside the stronghold, arming a bomb to enter the bunker.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 16}}\n\nAn error of programming forced Venom to threw the bomb away in order to save them, but it hit a spaceship who crashed into the bunker, opening the way.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 16}} The trio soon entered and attacked them, causing \"Pops\" to triple the bounty on the Punisher and apply it as well on Venom and Elektra.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 17}}\n\nAs the [[Terrigen Bomb]] was set off by [[Blackagar Boltagon (Earth-616)|Blackbolt]], the [[Terrigen Mist]] soon entered the bunker, and the Nobili went through a transformation into newly manifested [[Inhomo supremis|Inhumans]]. The Paguros' leaders escaped during the brawl, but Venom tossed a piece of the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Symbiote]] on one of them.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 17}}\n\nThe Paguros' clients were slaughtered by the Thunderbolts and the Nobili, while the three Paguros' leaders went to hid at [[P's Pizza]], where Thunderbolt [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] was coincidentally eating a pizza. Recognizing them, he immediately shot them three.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 18}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] thought that one of the three Paguros the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] had identified was on the cast of the [[Wikipedia:The Sopranos|Sopranos]].{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 14}}\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Crime Families]]\n[[Category:Italian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Cosa Nostra]]"
