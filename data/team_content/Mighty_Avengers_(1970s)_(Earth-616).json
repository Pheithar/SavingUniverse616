[[Kaluu (Earth-616)|Kaluu]] tracked down the black magic used in the were-bat to a secret subway station below the City Hall. The Mighty Avengers then attacked the Deathwalkers before they could make their sacrifice. After [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]] recovered the Talisman of Kamar-Taj, which was required to perform the sacrifice, [[Adam Brashear (Earth-616)|Adam Brashear]] caused the subway to collapse above the Deathwalkers. With the Deathwalkers stopped, the team disbanded.{{r|Mighty Avengers Vol 2 12}} \n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
