(Earth-616)|own Avengers team]].\n\nThe reputation of the company's former iteration caused [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to be suspicious of Da Costa's company, with Da Costa agreeing to have [[Clinton Barton (Earth-616)|Hawkeye]] planted on [[Hydrobase|Avengers Island]] to ensure A.I.M. didn't return to their villainous roots.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 1}} [[Melissa Gold (Earth-616)|Songbird]] was also planted as a spy, with her status being kept a secret even from Hawkeye,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 8}} though she would later become a triple agent.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 11}}\n\nA.I.M. came to blows with S.H.I.E.L.D. rather sooner as a consequence of assisting hacktivist [[Richard Jones (Earth-616)|Rick Jones]] in evading authorities. The only members of A.I.M. who opposed this move, [[Doreen Green (Earth-616)|Squirrel Girl]], [[William Kaplan (Earth-616)|Wiccan]] and [[Theodore Altman (Earth-616)|Hulkling]], were expelled of A.I.M. and had the name of the New Avengers bequeathed to them.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 8}} Both S.H.I.E.L.D. and the U.S. Army attacked Avengers Island,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 9}} forcing Bobby and his staff to move their operations to [[Avenger Base Two]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 10}}\n\nWhen Songbird's superior [[Jonathan Garrett (Earth-616)|John Garrett]] discovered she had become a triple agent,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 12}} he kidnapped her and interrogated her to get the location of A.I.M.'s new base.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 13}} On Da Costa's behalf, several of A.I.M.'s members rescued her from the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier she was being held.\n\nTaking advantage of A.I.M.'s new confrontation against S.H.I.E.L.D., the evil [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|Maker]] of [[World Headquarters for International Scientific/Philosophical Experimentation and Research (Earth-616)|W.H.I.S.P.E.R.]] attacked Avenger Base Two with his [[New Revengers (Earth-616)|New Revengers]] in an attempt to take over A.I.M.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 14}} A.I.M. managed to fend off the invaders,{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 15}} and they were later joined by the returned Songbird and the agents who rescued her, as well as the exiled New Avengers, who had been called in by Bobby to help. The arrival of more reinforcements than expected prompted the Maker to flee and move to his Plan B, which consisted of kidnapping the President.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 16}} However, Da Costa overturned his plan, and defeated the villain.\n\nWith A.I.M. and S.H.I.E.L.D. being in bad terms, Da Costa decided to bring the Maker in to the American government, to be in their good graces and motivate cooperation between them.{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 17}} After Da Costa and A.I.M. worked on behalf of the United States to take down rogue A.I.M. splinter cells, [[Robert Maverick (Earth-616)|General Maverick]] made a deal with S.H.I.E.L.D. to have A.I.M. become a branch of this organization and start working with the government, becoming [[American Intelligence Mechanics (Earth-616)|American Intelligence Mechanics]].{{r|New Avengers Vol 4 18}}\n| Equipment               = \n\n'''[[Avenger Three]]'''\n\n'''[[Avenger Four]]'''\n\n'''[[Avenger Five]]'''\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:A.I.M.
