Each warrior was the equal of a 100 lesser men. Warriors who helped Emperor [[Qin Shi Huangdi (Earth-616)|Shi Huangdi]] unite China and establish the Chinese empire. After the emperor's death, his weak and fearful son, Qin Er Shi, was manipulated by greedy men to turn on the warriors. They were lured to a temple in what would become the province of Yunnan, where they were imprisoned via the use of magics. A great dragon from [[K'un-Lun]] was placed at the temple to guard their prison. \n\nWhen the [[John Aman (Earth-616)|Prince of Orphans]] tried to release them from their prison so they could move on to the next world, general Sheng refused. Seeking to avenge themselves on the descendants of those who betrayed them, the vengeful spirits flew to the city of Kunming. Where they began to kill, forcing the Prince of Orphans and his ally [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]] to engage them in battle. After slaying the general, the Prince of Orphans appealed to the rest of the soldiers' honor and convinced them to move on to the next world, the Shadowlands.{{r|Immortal Weapons Vol 1 5}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Chinese Organizations]]"
