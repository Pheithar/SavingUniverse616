When these superheroes saved the life of Britain's Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill (Earth-616)|Winston Churchill]] from [[Wilhelm Lohmer (Earth-616)|Master Man]], the thankful Churchill suggested that they should become a team, known as the Invaders.{{r|Giant-Size Invaders #1}}\n\nThe Invaders [[World War II|fought]] the Axis Powers, saving Churchill once again from an attack by [[Meranno (Earth-616)|U-Man]]{{r|Invaders #4}} and were brain-washed by the [[Johann Shmidt (Earth-616)|Red Skull]] into attacking the allies.{{r|Invaders #5|6}}{{r|Marvel Premiere  #29|30}} Eventually they found themselves in England, where they met [[Montgomery Falsworth (Earth-616)|Lord James Montgomery Falsworth]], the original WWI-era Union Jack.{{r|Invaders #7}} He joined the team and provided them with a base of operations in England.{{r|Invaders #8}} However, his legs were crushed during their first mission to stop [[John Falsworth (Earth-616)|Baron Blood]].{{r|Invaders #9}} Eventually Falsworth's children [[Brian Falsworth (Earth-616)|Brian]] (the second Union Jack) and [[Jacqueline Falsworth (Earth-616)|Jacqueline]] (Spitfire) became members. The team later added [[Madeline Joyce (Earth-616)|Miss America]] and super-speedster [[Robert Frank (Earth-616)|the Whizzer]], during a battle with the [[Super-Axis (Earth-616)|Super-Axis]]. Later, against the threat of the [[Battle-Axis (Earth-616)|Battle-Axis]], the team added the [[Mark Todd (Earth-616)|Blazing Skull]] and the [[Elizabeth Barstow (Earth-616)|Silver Scorpion]] to its roster.\n\nDuring a mission in which they allied themselves with [[John Liberty (Earth-616)|Major Liberty]] as Captain America was busy with another assignment and [[Thomas Raymond (Earth-616)|Toro]] had appendicitis, the Invaders (Bucky, Human Torch and Namor) discovered [[Wolfgang von Strucker (Earth-616)|Baron Strucker]] had acquired a powerful artifact named the [[Gods' Whisper|Gods' Whisperer]] which let him control [[Asgard|Asgardian]] gods, and used it to make [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]] fight the Allies.{{r|All-New Invaders #1}} Strucker was defeated, and Hela returned to her realm, and the Invaders were left with the Whisperer. They decided the artifact was too powerful to be in control of anyone, and decided to break it into three pieces each of them would hide from anyone. With the help of [[Aarkus (Earth-616)|The Vision]], they forgot said events.{{r|All-New Invaders #2}}\n\nIn December of 1943, the Invaders were sent to Monte Cassino in Italy in order to retrieve a highly coveted weapon known as ''the Ordnung Zeitgeist'' before Hitler's forces could lay claim to it. They encountered a strange green mist that propelled them sixty years into the future where they encountered their modern day successors, the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]]. ''Note: The events surrounding this incident have not yet been fully revealed.''{{r|Avengers / Invaders #1}}\n\nThe Invaders killed an entire village of civilians in the [[Netherlands]], where they burned and killed a civilian populace, having no other choice, since the civilians became deformed, mindless monsters that turned anything they bit into one of them.{{r|Invaders Now! #5}}\n\nThe team continued to fight against several threats, and faced an emotional trauma with the apparent deaths of Captain America and Bucky in a drone aircraft's explosion near the end of [[World War II]].{{r|Avengers #4}} After the war's end, several members\u2014including the second Bucky and Captain America (respectively, [[Fred Davis (Earth-616)|Fred Davis]] and [[William Nasland (Earth-616)|William Nasland]], formerly the superhero Spirit of '76)\u2014created a new team, the [[All-Winners Squad (Earth-616)|All-Winners Squad]].{{r|What If? #4}} \n\n===All-New Invaders===\nYears later, after [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] was kidnapped by the [[Kree]] to obtain the location of his piece of the [[Gods' Whisper|Gods' Whisperer]], Jimmy Hammond and the Winter Soldier were attacked by Kree soldiers, who used a special device in each of them to obtain the information of the location of each one of their pieces. With the help of Captain America, the Winter Soldier managed to save the Human Torch from his attackers, and decided to reform the Invaders in order to rescue Namor from [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]], the Kree homeworld, and prevent the aliens from using the Whisperer.{{r|All-New Invaders #1|2}}\n\nAs soon as they got to Hala with the help of the original [[Aarkus (Earth-616)|Vision]], the Invaders were ambushed by the Pursuer Corps{{r|All-New Invaders #3}} and later forced to fight the Whisperer-controlled [[Ikaris (Earth-616)|Ikaris]]. By faking his death, the Winter Soldier managed to get to and free the captured Vision{{r|All-New Invaders #4}} and distract [[R'Klll (Earth-616)|Tanalth]] long enough for Captain America and the Human Torch to subdue the Kree soldiers present in the battle while Namor fought Ikaris. The Vision teleported to get help from the [[Eternals (Race)|Eternals]] and recover the Whisperer. After that, the Invaders returned to Earth and later disbanded.{{r|All-New Invaders #5}}\n\nThe Winter Soldier, Namor and the Human Torch reformed the Invaders in order to rescue their former teammate, [[Thomas Raymond (Earth-616)|Toro]].{{r|All-New Invaders #8}} [[Clare Gruler (Earth-616)|Iron Cross]], [[Ryoko Sabuki (Earth-616)|Radiance]],{{r|All-New Invaders #11}} [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America (Sam Wilson)]], and Toro would later join the team.{{r|All-New Invaders #14}}\n\n==The Invaders==\n* Initial roster:\n** [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America (Steve Rogers)]]\n** [[James Buchanan Barnes (Earth-616)|Bucky/Winter Soldier (James Barnes)]]\n** [[Jim Hammond (Earth-616)|Human Torch (Jim Hammond / Android)]]\n** [[Thomas Raymond (Earth-616)|Toro (Thomas Raymond)]]\n** [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor the Sub-Mariner (Namor McKenzie)]]\n\n* Later WWII recruits:\n** [[Montgomery Falsworth (Earth-616)|Union Jack I (Lord James Montgomery Falsworth)]]\n** [[Brian Falsworth (Earth-616)|Union Jack II (Lord Brian Falsworth)]]\n** [[Jacqueline Falsworth (Earth-616)|Spitfire (Lady Jacqueline Falsworth)]]\n** [[Madeline Joyce (Earth-616)|Miss America (Madeline Joyce)]]\n** [[Robert Frank (Earth-616)|Whizzer (Robert Frank)]]\n** [[Aarkus (Earth-616)|Vision (Aarkus)]]\n** [[Mark Todd (Earth-616)|Blazing Skull (Mark Todd)]]\n** [[Elizabeth Barstow (Earth-616)|Silver Scorpion (Elizabeth Barstow)]]\n**[[William Nasland (Earth-616)|Spirit of '76 / Captain America II (William Nasland)]]\n**[[Fred Davis (Earth-616)|Bucky II (Fred Davis)]]\n\n* Modern recruits:\n** [[Roger Aubrey (Earth-616)|Destroyer (Roger Aubrey)]]\n** [[Clare Gruler (Earth-616)|Iron Cross (Carrie Gruler)]]\n** [[Ryoko Sabuki (Earth-616)|Radiance (Ryoko Sabuki)]]\n** [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Captain America (Sam Wilson)]]\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Their rallying cry is \"Okay, Axis, here we come!\"\n| Trivia                  = * The concept of a team called \"the Invaders\" was originally conceived by [[Stan Lee]] for the name of a team comprised by [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]] and the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk]], when he considered merging their solo features in ''[[Tales to Astonish Vol 1|Tales to Astonish]]'', but the idea was eventually dropped. When [[Roy Thomas]] pitched the idea of a team of superheroes set during [[World War II]], he remembered that Stan Lee liked the name \"Invaders,\" and worked it into his pitch of the book.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/hulk-namor-invaders/|title=Comic Legends: Did the Hulk and Namor Almost Form Their Own Team?|work=CBR.com|first=Brian|last=Cronin|date=31 August 2018|accessdate=31 August 2018}}}}\n* The real world prototype for the Invaders, the All-Winners Squad, was an actual historic Golden Age comic book feature with only two appearances in {{cl|All Winners Comics Vol 1 19}} (Fall 1946) and [[All Winners Comics Vol 1 21|#21]] (Winter 1946; there was no issue #20). This team had much of the same membership as the Invaders, but had its adventures in the post-World War II era, the time that their adventures were published.\n* After the Invaders' introduction in the pages of ''Avengers'', the team appeared in its own try-out title, ''Giant-Size Invaders'' #1 in 1975, followed by the ongoing series ''Invaders'' later that year, and a single annual in 1977. Issues #5\u20136 of the series introduced another retcon World War II team, the Liberty Legion, in two parts of a story arc, \"The Red Skull Strikes\", interlaced with another two parts in Marvel Premiere #29\u201330.\n| Links                   = * [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Invaders Invaders on Marvel.com]\n* [http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/All-Star_Squadron_(New_Earth) All-Star Squadron, A DC Comics counterpart to the Invaders]\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invaders_(comics) Invaders article on Wikipedia]\n}}\n[[Category:International Organizations]]\n[[Category:Allied Organizations]]"
