The mission was successful, despite the death of one of their members, and the Morlocks decided to leave the city and part their ways.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Morlocks]]"
