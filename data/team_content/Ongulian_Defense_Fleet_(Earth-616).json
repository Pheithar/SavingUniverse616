He then swore revenge on Id.\n\nThe fleet traveled through space with his soldiers during six years, looking for allies with suicidal tendencies and information on Id. At some point, they contacted [[Funtzel Intergalactic Towing & Recovery]] to hire them to destroy Id but the boss' brother in-law [[Macho Gomez (Earth-616)|Macho Gomez]] refused. Later, the boss, [[Funtzel (Earth-616)|Funtzel]], and his employee and would-be brother-in-law [[Obb (Earth-616)|Obb]], called them back, intending to kill [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], their new and dangerous employee, in the process. \n\nKak was okay on the new guy, as he had heard of him in a bar, after Deadpool had launch a \"viral campaign promotion\" in letting escape mercenaries of the [[Exto Clan (Earth-616)|Exto Clan]] on a precedent mission.\n\nKak intended to trap Id by blowing it up while it concentrated on destroy the planet [[Urrulu]]. Deadpool strongly disapproved, shot Kak in the arm and used the Command Ship to relocate the [[Urrulians]] on another planet, where he left both them and the Ongulians. He made Id tracking him on [[U-235]], swallow this planet and blow.\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = [[Ongulian Command Vessel|Command Ship of the Ongulian Defense Fleet]]\n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
