They were all inspired by the [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|Punisher]] and came together as a group hoping that he would lead them in their campaign against crime. When the Punisher did find them, he pronounced The Holy a lunatic, Elite a Nazi, and informed Mr. Payback of the innocent people who he had killed before he killed the group.{{r|Punisher Vol 5 11|12}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Defunct Teams]]"
