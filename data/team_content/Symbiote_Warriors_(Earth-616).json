She was planting C4 bombs to destroy them when they abruptly broke the glass, ready to attack her. Seeing the clones bonded to [[Symbiotes]] made their purpose as living weapons clear to X-23, leaving her with no choice but to kill them. X-23 managed to kill one of them{{r|Venom Vol 2 13}} while the other three went on to protect Blackheart, as they were created to do.{{r|Venom Vol 2 13.1}} When X-23 tried to get to Blackheart, he ordered the three remaining Symbiote Warriors to kill her, but she killed them first.{{r|Venom Vol 2 13.2}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Though the [[Glossary:Clone|clones]] would have inherited [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|X-23]]'s healing factor, healing factors do not work in [[Hell]], making them easier to kill than they might have otherwise been.\n* The source of their [[Symbiotes]] is not directly stated, but they are implied to have been somehow derived from [[Toxin (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Toxin]] as this was the only symbiote in [[Blackheart (Earth-616)|Blackheart]]'s possession.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Clones]]\n[[Category:Symbiotes-possessed]]\n[[Category:Mutants cloned/created after M-Day]]\n[[Category:Clones of Laura Kinney]]\n[[Category:Mutants (Homo superior)]]\n[[Category:Symbiote-Enhanced Organizations]]"
