However, the Alpha-Males didn't have any of Alpha's powers, as the accident that gave them to him didn't alter his DNA. The Alpha-Males were ultimately destroyed by Alpha when he managed to break free from the [[Carbonadium]] shackles the Jackal used to restrain him.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 693}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Clones]]\n[[Category:Clones Created by Miles Warren]]"
