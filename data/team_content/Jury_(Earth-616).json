The Vault itself was heavily damaged by the [[U-Foes (Earth-616)|U-Foes]] several years later.{{Citation}}\n\nTaylor and his other son Max decided to seek revenge. A number of other disgruntled [[Guardsmen (Earth-616)|Guardsmen]] joined them as the Jury. They sought to 'try' villains, starting with Venom but he escaped due to the intervention of Roland Treece. Later the Jury kidnapped Spider-Man and tried him for bringing the Venom symbiote to earth. Again the Jury was defeated.{{Citation}}\n\nLater Orwell began to work with the [[Life Foundation (Earth-616)|Life Foundation]] and the Jury became more or less flunkies.{{Citation}}\n\nAfter parting ways with Orwell his eldest son Max, aka [[Maxwell Taylor (Earth-616)|Screech]], reformed the Jury and tried to make it more representative of an American court of law. Max chose to give up his Screech costume and become the Jury's defense attorney. A mysterious man known as [[Gavel (Earth-616)|Gavel]] was the judge for the Jury's trials. [[Olivia Lentz (Earth-616)|Olivia Lentz]], a mysterious woman with a history in dealing with symbiotes was the prosecutor. To replace Screech the team recruited former Guardsman [[Jennifer Stewart (Earth-616)|Jenny Stewart]] whose husband was murdered by the second [[Luis Alvarez (Earth-616)|Tarantula]] during a prison riot. Jenny was given the codename Wysper. She killed Tarantula in a deathmatch and was officially made a member.{{Citation}}\n\nSometime later the Jury lost their support staff and funding. They were later hired by industrialist [[Edwin Cord (Earth-616)|Edwin Cord]], a recurring enemy of Iron Man's. [[Jonathan Walker (Earth-616)|US Agent]] was hired to be the team's field leader.{{Citation}}\n\nAfter learning that [[Abner Jenkins (Earth-616)|Abner Jenkins]] had been arrested, Cord decided to apprehend the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]]. They were unsuccessful. The Jury was later prohibited from attacking [[Franklin Hall (Earth-616)|Graviton]] after his destruction of the [[Redeemers (Earth-616)|Redeemers]]. The Jury and the Thunderbolts reluctantly ended up working together to defeat the [[Imperial Forces (Earth-616)|Secret Empire]].{{Citation}}\n\n| Equipment               =  The Jury wear specially modified version of the [[Guardsman Armor]], with each member having a specific weapon or function.\n| Transportation          = [[Justifier]]\n| Weapons                 = \n\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n[[File:Jury (Earth-616) from Thunderbolts Vol 1 23 0001.jpg|thumb]]\n* In {{cl|Thunderbolts #23}} we see the line up of the Jury as Sentry, Bomblast, Firearm, Ramshot and Wysper with Screech no longer on the team. But when we see them unmasked Firearm, who is black is depicted as looking as blonde and white like Maxwell Taylor aka Screech. Presumably this is an art error rather than an indication that Maxwell Taylor is now Firearm. \n| Links                   = \n}}"
