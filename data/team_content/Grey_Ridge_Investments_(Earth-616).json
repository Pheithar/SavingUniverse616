When its managing director [[Barry Gleason (Earth-616)|Barry Gleason]] discovered their newest director of security, [[Manuela Calderon (Earth-616)|Manny Calderon]], was the only survivor of [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Cletus Kasady]]'s first murder spree, they arranged with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|FBI]] to use the mine as the location of a trap for Carnage, whose psychological profile determined he would try to attack Calderon as soon as he discovered she had survived.\n\nWith the help of the US Army, the mine was set up with sonic cannons, which were put in use as soon as Carnage arrived to the scene to kill Calderon. The trap worked, and Carnage was captured in a cage. However, the cannons shook through the back-fill over an old tunnel the FBI had not been informed of, and the ground swallowed Carnage and several agents, forcing FBI agents [[Claire Dixon (Earth-616)|Claire Dixon]] and [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]], army soldier [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]], and Calderon herself to go down to the dark underground to capture Carnage and save the agents.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 1}}\n\nAfter the surviving agents were extracted, Claire Dixon ordered the mine to be collapsed in a desperate but unsuccessful attempt to kill Carnage once and for all.{{r|Carnage Vol 2 5}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
