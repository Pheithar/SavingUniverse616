The Saur-Lords were not impressed due to him being a human. [[Zabu]] was later attacked by two of the Saur-Lords, but [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] came to his aid. Together the pair battled the dinosaur men but eventually A.I.M. surrounded them and they were ordered to surrender.\n\n[[Rachel Leighton (Earth-616)|Diamondback]] disguised as an A.I.M. agent, rescued them by causing disruption in the Saur-Lords' ranks. Diamondback shot the Saur-Lord called Allo, but Anky continued to fight even though Zabu eventually won. They met up with [[Samuel Wilson (Earth-616)|Falcon]] and continued their journey.\n\nThe Saur-Lord Pter abducts [[Maza]], a native of the [[Savage Land]], from the \n[[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther's]] Skycycle. Black Panther then tracked the dinosaurs to their citadel. Anky and Allo recovered and were found by the A.I.M. agents. The Dino-Lords consisting of Pter, Styro and Bront fought the trio of heroes at the citadel after their master the [[High Technician (Earth-616)|High Technician]] was knocked out. \n\nSuddenly, the citadel was attacked by the alien invader [[Terminus]]. Styro and Pter attempt to protect their master from Terminus, but both their efforts were in vain and they were tossed aside like flies.{{r|Captain America #414|417}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Savage Land Races]]\n[[Category:Reptiles]]"
