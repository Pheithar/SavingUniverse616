Alex got married, Argus filmed a documentary, Aundray opened a dance studio, Ginger and LaHoya starred in a TV show filmed in New Zeland, and Gloria took over as Spider's guardian.{{r|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 3}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
