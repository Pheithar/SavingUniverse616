They came into conflict against [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] when, as a result of the destruction of [[Asgardia]], all contents of [[Odin's Vault]] were scattered across the cosmos. The [[Warlock's Eye]] fell in the hands of the Disciples of Cyttorak, and Thor attempted to steal it from their temple. He didn't go unnoticed, and the Disciples tried to chase him off before the [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]] confronted him. When Thor summoned an entire arsenal of hammers, he used them as a conduct for his powers, and electrocuted the Disciples. He then used all of the hammers in the process of defeating the Juggernaut.{{r|Thor Vol 5 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Cyttorak Cult]]"
