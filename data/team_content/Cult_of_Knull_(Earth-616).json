imbuing them with knowledge of the primordial god of the abyss, [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], who had been sealed away at the core of [[Klyntar (Location)|Klyntar]] by his own creations when they rebelled against him.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born #1}}\n\nCrossing the Atlantic Ocean to [[North America]] at some time prior to the 15th century, the cult established a foothold in the forests and caves near what would eventually be known as [[Westchester County]], preying upon the [[Wappinger (Earth-616)|Wappinger]] and other local indigenous tribes - who referred to them as \"the Others\" - who intruded into their territory.\n\n[[File:Cult of Knull (Earth-616) from Ruins of Ravencroft Carnage Vol 1 1 001.png|thumb|left|200px|North American sect, circa 1664.]]\n\nWhen Italian explorer Giovanni de Verranazzo led a party of soldiers into their territory in 1524, the cult ambushed and sacrificed several of them, causing de Verranazzo to flee back to Europe. In 1664, the cult attempted to abduct [[Molly Ravencroft (Earth-616)|Molly Ravencroft]], who managed to escape. When her husband [[Cortland Kasady (Earth-616)|Cortland Kasady]] came to rescue her and strayed too deep into their caves, the cult ambushed him and infected him with living abyss - corrupting his bloodline in the process.{{r|Ruins of Ravencroft: Carnage Vol 1 1}} By the late eighteenth century, the cult had mysteriously vanished from the region and their whereabouts until the early twenty-first century are unknown.{{r|Ruins of Ravencroft: Sabretooth Vol 1 1}}\n\n===Modern Times===\nSecretly enduring into modern times, the cult accrued enough resources and members to form paramilitary units, research teams, and field mobile command centers.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage: Symbiote of Vengeance Vol 1 1}} The cult began posing as a legitimate religion and calling themselves the Church of the New Darkness, constructing a temple to Knull disguised as a cathedral.{{r|Web of Venom: Cult of Carnage Vol 1 1}} After the nihilistic serial killer [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Cletus Kasady]] - a direct descendant of Cortland Kasady - bonded to a [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|symbiote]] and began calling himself Carnage, the cult took to revering him as the prophet of Knull; to the point of concocting a narrative about how Knull had chosen Cletus as his emissary from birth.<!--{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}}-->\n\nAt some point, the [[Scorn (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Scorn symbiote]] fell under Knull's influence and corrupted its host, [[Tanis Nieves (Earth-616)|Tanis Nieves]], who became a high-ranking member of the cult.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born Vol 1 1}} When Knull's resurgence was foiled by Venom,{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 1}} - {{cl|Venom Vol 4 6|6}}}} Tanis decided to resurrect Carnage and turn him into Knull's avatar. To enact this plan, she led a squad of soldiers to retrieve Cletus Kasady's corpse after it fell to Earth, and sent another squad to retrieve [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a sample of the Grendel symbiote]] from [[Interdimensional Council of Reeds (Multiverse)|Project Oversight]]. Tanis bonded the sample of the Grendel symbiote to Cletus, reanimating him and connecting him to Knull. Rather than submit to Knull's control, Cletus ripped out Scorn's spine and consumed the Carnage symbiote's codex - trace remnants of the symbiote left over from her time as its host - which prevented Knull from taking over him. However, Carnage decided to free Knull and assumed command of the cult, setting out to hunt down former and current symbiote hosts to devour their codexes and symbiotes.{{r|Web of Venom: Carnage Born #1}} \n\nCarnage's first move was to conquer the [[Underground City]] of San Francisco - which Venom had once protected - and establish a Spire of living abyss at its center, enslaving its citizens by [[Carnage's Hive (Earth-616)|infecting them with pieces of his symbiote]] and sending them to hunt down former symbiote hosts; though this alerted the Venom symbiote to his return.{{r|Web of Venom: Unleashed #1}} Carnage then recruited his old allies [[Frances Barrison (Earth-616)|Shriek]] and the [[Doppelganger (Spider-Man) (Earth-616)|Doppelganger]] to his cause. Shriek resumed her alias of \"Sandra Deel\" and began acting as the cult's public face, acquiring the Last Chance Church in [[Doverton]], [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]] - which Carnage [[Carnage, U.S.A. Vol 1|had once conquered]] years earlier - and renovating it into a temple to Knull. Shriek and Carnage subsequently converted the populace of Doverton to the cult and harvested their symbiote codices, leaving the city in ruins and alerting the [[Aberrant Crimes Division (Earth-616)|Aberrant Crimes Division]] and [[Anti-Symbiote Task Force (Earth-616)|Anti-Symbiote Task Force]] to their activities.{{r|Web of Venom: Cult of Carnage #1}}{{r|Scream: Curse of Carnage #5}}\n[[File:Church of the New Darkness Headquarters from Web of Venom Cult of Carnage Vol 1 1 001.png|thumb|left|Headquarters of the Church of the New Darkness.]]\nOver several months, Carnage continued to hunt codexes,{{r|Absolute Carnage: Weapon Plus #1}}{{r|Web of Venom: Funeral Pyre #1}} at times assisted by a team of cultists acting as mission control and at times acting alone.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Symbiote of Vengeance #1}} Under Carnage's control, [[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|John Jameson]] captured ACD agent [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]]  and imprisoned her in Ravencroft. Returning to Manhattan, Kasady established another Spire underneath Grand Street, sitting out the [[War of the Realms]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 15}} Deciding to make his move, Kasady infiltrated [[Ryker's Island]] and killed [[Lee Price (Earth-616)|Lee Price]] to claim his codices and the [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Mania symbiote]],{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2019 Spider-Man/Venom}} before going after Eddie Brock - who was rescued by the Venom symbiote.{{r|Absolute Carnage #1}} Summoning the Knull-corrupted [[Riot (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Riot]], [[Agony (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Agony]], [[Phage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Phage]], and [[Lasher (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Lasher]] symbiotes to go after [[Norman Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Normie Osborn]],{{r|Absolute Carnage: Separation Anxiety #1}}{{r|Venom Vol 4 17}} Kasady compelled John Jameson to lure Spider-Man and Venom into a trap and took over [[Ravencroft Institute]],{{r|Absolute Carnage #1}} infecting [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] with [[Carnage V (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|an offshoot of the Dark Carnage symbiote]] to turn him into a copy of his original Carnage form, enslaving the inmates and turning them into a horde of four-armed Carnage doppelgangers, and resurrecting [[Demogoblin (Earth-616)|Demogoblin]] using Shriek as a vessel.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Lethal Protectors #1}} When Deadpool burned down Ravencroft,{{r|Absolute Carnage vs. Deadpool #1}} Kasady returned to the Spire underneath Grand Street, unleashing his horde on the city - claiming [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Spider-Man (Miles Morales)]] and the resurrected Knull-corrupted [[Scream (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Scream]] - which took over former Mania host [[Patricia Robertson (Earth-616)|Patricia Robertson]] - as minions.{{r|Absolute Carnage: Miles Morales #1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage: Scream #1}}\n\nAs the heroes retreated to Rex Strickland's warehouse to use [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|the Maker]]'s [[Symbiote Codex Isolation and Thermo-Heated Extraction]] machine to remove as many codices as they could, Dark Carnage disguised himself as Eddie Brock once more and infiltrated it. Upon being exposed, Dark Carnage summoned his horde to battle the assembled heroes, managing to assimilate the Venom symbiote into his own. Bonding to [[Venom III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|an amalgam of the codices]], Eddie Brock killed Cletus Kasady with a [[Glossary:Necrosword|Necrosword]], reclaimed the Venom symbiote, and absorbed the Dark Carnage symbiote into it. The people being controlled by the Dark Carnage symbiote's offshoots were subsequently freed, though the cult's ultimate goal was achieved: by absorbing the codices and Dark Carnage symbiote, Venom had awakened Knull and unleashed him from his prison.{{r|Absolute Carnage #5}} \n\nWhile many of the cultists who had worshipped Knull prior to Dark Carnage assuming control of the cult were sacrificed to harvest codices or simply because Dark Carnage wanted to kill someone,{{r|Web of Venom: Cult of Carnage Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage: Symbiote of Vengeance Vol 1 1}}{{r|Absolute Carnage vs. Deadpool Vol 1 1}} after Dark Carnage's death the cult retreated into the shadows to prepare for Knull's arrival. Infiltrating the newly-founded [[J.A.N.U.S. (Earth-616)|J.A.N.U.S.]] organization, the cult infiltrated to the Ravencroft institute to reclaim Cortland Kasady's body.{{r|Ravencroft Vol 1 5}}\n\n<!--A few weeks after Knull was unleashed, [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan Brock]] succumbed to his corrupting influence, pledging to spread the dark elder god's worship and kill anyone who tried to stop him.{{r|Web of Venom: The Good Son Vol 1 1}} - The events of {{cl|Web of Venom: The Good Son Vol 1 1}} are ignored by the [[Venom Island]], making them of dubious canonicity.-->\n| Equipment               = While under Scorn's command, the cult was able to field paramilitary units equipped with combat armor emblazoned with Knull's dragon-emblem.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = * The Church of the New Darkness is inspired by the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]' [[Starry Wisdom Cult (Earth-616)|Church of Starry Wisdom]], the [[w:c:lovecraft:Esoteric Order of Dagon|Esoteric Order of Dagon]], and other religious organizations serving as fronts for the worship of ancient eldritch horrors such the [[Great Old Ones]].\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Symbiotes-possessed]]\n[[Category:Cthulhu Mythos Pastiches]]\n[[Category:Alien-Based Earth Religions]]\n[[Category:Mystical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Symbiotes]]\n[[Category:Symbiote-Enhanced Organizations]]\n[[Category:Cannibals]]\n[[Category:Knull Worshipers]]\n[[Category:Elder Gods Clergy]]"
