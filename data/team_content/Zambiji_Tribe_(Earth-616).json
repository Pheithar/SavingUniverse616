They worshiped [[Kai-Mak (Earth-616)|Kai-Mak]] the so-called shark god. When the tribe would regularly offer human sacrifices to Kai-Mak. When they captured an American explorer and his daughter, they would arouse the attention of the inter-dimensional hero known as the [[Aarkus (Earth-616)|Vision]] who would battle and kill Kai-Mak.\n\nWith their god slain by this other worldly hero, the Vision would order them to no longer be aggressive toward strangers in their land.
