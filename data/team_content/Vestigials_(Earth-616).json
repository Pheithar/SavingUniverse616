This turned out to be a blessing, as other than [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]] they became the only survivors of the [[Badoon]] genocide of their people.{{r|Gamora Vol 1 3}}\n\nIn the planet's final days [[Gamora Zen Whoberi Ben Titan (Earth-7528)|Gamora]] came to [[Ubliex]] looking to kill [[L'Wit (Earth-616)|L'Wit]] and came across the Vestigials, whose leader [[Divadi (Earth-616)|Divadi]] welcomed her as the closest family she had left. The Vestigials found the only way off the planet with the use of the [[Elemental]] and offered Gamora a seat on their ship.{{r|Gamora Vol 1 4}} However, in her pursuit of L'Wit Gamora had realized that her quest for revenge had consumed her, leaving her no other meaning in life. When the leader of the Vestigials left her for dead to save his own skin, Gamora saw them as being no better than [[Thanos (Earth-616)|Thanos]] and decided to abandon her only ties to the past, taking L'Wit and a few other refugees with her instead and leaving the criminals to die.{{r|Gamora Vol 1 5}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
