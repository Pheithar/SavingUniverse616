He arrived to find Ezra Keith dead, his death being investigated by [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] and [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Ororo Munroe]], and his affairs being executed by [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]]. The four became aware of Ezra's past with the Crusade through the investigation, and with the help of [[Eden Fesi (Earth-616)|Eden Fesi]], they brought a measure of justice against the perpetrators, and earned in their own sight their place as the Crusade's heirs.{{r|Black Panther and the Crew Vol 1}}\n\nFollowing [[T'Challa (Earth-616)|Black Panther]]'s gathering of evidence of outside influences fueling dissent in [[Wakanda]], T'Challa reassembled the Crew to defeat the villains{{r|Black Panther Vol 6 6}} funding the dissent, and to then rescue Shuri, T'Challa's sister, from the Djalia.
