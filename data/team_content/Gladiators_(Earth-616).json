Flynn brought in several powerful mutants to the arena including [[Alison Blaire (Earth-616)|Dazzler]] and [[Henry McCoy (Earth-616)|the Beast]]. Eventually, Hugo and Flynn came into conflict over the management of the troupe and many of the Gladiators, who were being controlled by Flynn's own mutant powers, killed Hugo in the arena in front of hundreds of spectators.{{Citation}} \n\n[[File:Hugo_Longride_(Earth-616)_from_Beauty_&_the_Beast_03_001.jpg|thumb|left|175px]]\n\nNow fully in control of the Gladiators, Flynn wanted to use them as his personal army to invade and conquer the small European nation of [[Latveria]], which was ruled over by his supposed father, [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]].  However, Flynn was defeated before he could set his plan into motion and lost control of the troupe to one of the Gladiators, [[Max Rocker (Earth-616)|Max Rocker]].{{Citation}}\n\nA short time later the powerful telepath known as the [[Shadow King (Multiverse)|Shadow King]] had taken control over another mutant named [[Xi'an Coy Manh (Earth-616)|Karma]] and together they took over the running of the Gladiators and the Underground Mutant Theatre. Also, the Shadow King was masquerading as Alexander Flynn during this time period.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 29|30}}\n\nEventually, the Shadow King was defeated by a combined force of the New Mutants, [[Katherine Pryde (Earth-616)|Shadow Cat]], [[Rachel Summers (Earth-811)|Rachel Summers]] and the Dazzler.{{r|New Mutants Vol 1 31|32}}\n\nThe subsequent fate of the troupe has yet to be recorded.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * The Los Angeles [[Underground Mutant Theatre]] of which the Gladiators are the star draw is probably either a competitor or predecessor to the network of superhuman fight arenas [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]] encountered [[X-Treme X-Men Vol 1 36|many years later]].\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = [http://www.rayeye.nl/ Rayeye's Ocean X] (NL)\n}}"
