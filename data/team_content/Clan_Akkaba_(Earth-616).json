Before the arrival of the time traveling Pharaoh [[Nathaniel Richards (Rama-Tut) (Earth-6311)|Rama-Tut]], who would one day become [[Kang the Conqueror]] and then [[Immortus]], [[Akkaba (Egypt)|Akkaba]] was a small but promising lone settlement on the very edge of the [[Amentet]] and the very edge of the [[Valley of the Kings]]. Its members were a suspicious and superstitious lot who prided themselves a culture separate and apart from the rest of Egypt. Their fear, however, proved to be their undoing. News spread throughout Egypt of the new Pharaoh who had fallen from the sky and seized control of the throne. They took this as an omen so when one of their lot gave birth to a gray child with blue lines running across his lips and face, they quickly cast the child out, unaware that their rejection would cause the child to eventually become [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]].{{r|Rise of Apocalypse #1}}\n\nNot realizing the value of the child they had left to die, they carried on with their simple life. This mistake would be their last as [[Baal (Sandstormers) (Earth-616)|Baal]] and the [[Sandstormers (Earth-616)|Sandstormers]] massacred them all in search of the child. Akkaba was bathed in blood. The only survivor was En Sabah Nur, the first one, so named by his new father Baal.{{r|Rise of Apocalypse #1}}\n\n===Domination===\n[[File:Clan Akkaba (Earth-616) from X-Men Apocalypse vs. Dracula Vol 1 1 001.jpg|left|thumb]]\nWhen Apocalypse fully realized his power and defeated the Pharaoh and his army, Egypt entered a new age, one in which his children walked among them. Apocalypse forged his clan, now called Clan Akkaba after his birthplace and those who had left him to die. During this time, the site of Akkaba reached somewhat of a renaissance as great monuments were erected there, whether by Apocalypse, his descendants or by the new Pharaoh, no one knows.{{r|Cable #18}}\n\nThe clan at this point began forming customs, whether by Apocalypse's will or their own accord. They lived by the \"survival of the fittest\" creed and the members of the clan would deceive, betray and even kill their own relations merely to be deemed closest to Apocalypse. Egypt peaked and so too did the clan's influence on the world. With attacks by [[Alexander of Macedon (Earth-616)|Alexander the Great]] and his Persian armies, Apocalypse and his kin fought valiantly in a battle he would never forget. This battle helped him winnow out the weak in his clan and as Egypt became nothing but a distant memory, the clan's influence moved on to [[Roman Empire|Ancient Rome]].{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}\n\n[[File:Clan_Akkaba_(Earth-616)_from_X-Men_Apocalypse_vs._Dracula_Vol_1_1_002.jpg|thumb]]\n===[[Ancient Rome]]===\nFor thousands of years, Clan Akkaba had the mission of safeguarding the legacies and mantras of their lord and ancestor. They weaved in and out of history when called upon to do his bidding. It was said when [[Rome (Italy)|Rome]] burned, Clan Akkaba was there to light the fire.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}\n\n===12th Century===\nDuring the Third Crusade,{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: X-Men 2005 Vol 1 1}}{{r|Marvel Atlas #1}} [[Bennet du Paris (Earth-616)|Bennet du Paris]] encountered in Akkaba the mutants [[Sahreed (Earth-616)|Sahreed]] and [[Scarab (Clan Akkaba) (Earth-616)|The Scarab]], before manifesting his own powers.{{r|Black Knight: Exodus #1}} After du Paris refused to become his servant, Apocalypse locked away the knight he had renamed \"Exodus\" for centuries in the [[Swiss Alps]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: X-Men 2005 Vol 1 1}}\n\n===15th Century===\nIn 1459 in [[Romania]], the [[War (15th Century) (Earth-616)|Horseman of War]] led [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-616)|Apocalypse]]'s [[Dark Riders (Earth-616)|Riders of the Dark]] against [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Vlad Dracula's]] army.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}\n\n===17th Century===\n[[File:Clan_Akkaba_(Earth-616)_from_X-Men_Apocalypse_vs._Dracula_Vol_1_1_004.jpg|left|thumb]]\nClan Akkaba allegedly had at least a member on the [[Mayflower]]'s journey to the [[North America|New World]] in 1620.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}\n\n===18th Century===\nWhen thousands were led to the guillotine during the [[French Revolution]], Clan Akkaba was there to sharpen the blade.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}\n\n[[File:Clan_Akkaba_(Earth-616)_from_X-Men_Apocalypse_vs._Dracula_Vol_1_1_003.jpg|right|thumb]]\nAt this time the have reproduced and gave birth to the biggest clan they had ever seen in their long history. They gathered many riches and placed themselves in notable and influential positions to better influence and control the world. As the clan grew, it evolved, holding true to its \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 creed, they continued to battle and kill each other to gain Apocalypse\u2019s favor. Although it is unknown what threats they faced early on in the new world. [[Margaret Slade (Earth-616)|Margaret Slade]], the eldest known Akkaba member at the time, noted she had witnessed Apocalypse cut a whole tribe of [[N'Garai]] demons to pieces when she was a girl. Being the oldest member of the clan dictated that none of the other members had been born yet. Still chairman [[Kabar Brashir (Earth-616)|Kabar Brashir]], who was roughly the age of her eldest son Hamilton, had witnessed the clan summon Apocalypse thirty-six years previously when he was just a boy. It is unknown what these threats to the clan were, but none prepared them for what lay ahead. Noted leaders include [[Hamilton Slade (Akkaba) (Earth-616)|Hamilton Slade]], [[Frederick Slade (Earth-616)|Frederick Slade]], Kabar Brashir, and Margaret Slade.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}\n\n===19th Century===\nDuring the Victorian era, the clan was set upon by [[Vlad Dracula (Earth-616)|Dracula]] and nearly exterminated. A string of mysterious murders started to take place surrounding members of the clan. When their leader Hamilton disappeared, they were left with no choice but to summon their lord. In 1897, they awoke Apocalypse in order to deal with the threat of Dracula, unknown to the members of the clan, Dracula was turning members of Clan Akkaba into [[Vampires]] in order to battle Apocalypse, as revenge for his earlier defeat and the way the Dark Lord previously shamed him. As punishment for being so weak in requesting a boon from him, Apocalypse killed one of their leaders.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1}}\n\nThe ensuing battle sees the massacre and extermination of all members of Clan Akkaba except [[Jack Starsmore (Earth-616)|Jack Starsmore]] and Frederick Slade and their disbandment by decree of Apocalypse. With help from Apocalypse and [[Abraham van Helsing (Earth-616)|Van Helsing]], they managed to kill Dracula, although the master vampire would frequently return and suffer many more deaths. The continuation of the Akkaba line was secured by [[Ozymandias (Earth-616)|Ozymandias]] through Frederick Slade impregnating a prostitute called Miss Ferguson. Ozymandias, realizing an opportunity to get revenge on Apocalypse, secretly planned to reshape the clan in his image for use against his lord eventually.{{r|X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula #1|4}}\n\n===Rebirth===\nThe new clan Akkaba assembled recently under Ozymandias and an elderly Fredrick Slade. This new clan revealed that [[Jonothon Starsmore (Earth-616)|Chamber]] was a member of their bloodline, being a descendant of Jack Starsmore. While the Starsmore family never forgot about Apocalypse, Chamber rejected their offers. It is unknown where the clan\u2019s loyalties lie and what plans they had up their sleeve, but as they said, Clan Akkaba will always be there.{{r|New Excalibur Vol 1 9}}\n\n===The Apocalypse Solution===\n[[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], whom [[Warren Worthington III (Earth-616)|Warren Worthington]] had been paying to search for Clan Akkaba, found a [[Celestials|Celestial]] ship buried underground where the clan killed one of their own during a ritual. Deadpool ended up caught, but not before the rest of [[X-Force (Earth-616)|X-Force]] was alerted. X-Force were able to rescue Deadpool and defeat the savage creature that attacked him, but the temple itself made a temporal jump, forcing the team to retreat. Warren then commented that the creature they defeated was [[War]], and not only was the clan trying to resurrect Apocalypse, they had also revived his final Horsemen. Later it was revealed that Apocalypse had been revived as a young boy and was being taken care of by the Clan Akkaba's members themselves.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #1}}\n\nThe clan was teaching the young Apocalypse that X-Men were tricking the [[Homo superior|mutants]] into being locked away, telling them it was for their own good. He was told that the X-Men were tyrants and Apocalypse was the savior. That the worshippers of X (Uncanny X-Force) would come to kill him because he threatened their grip on power, and it was his birthright to usher in the salvation of homo superior by bringing about the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. When X-Force came to kill Apocalypse, they were instead defeated by the final [[Horsemen of Apocalypse (Earth-616)|Horsemen of Apocalypse]]. Ozymandias told the young Apocalypse they should kill X-Force, but the boy did not want to kill anyone, so Ozymandias ordered the Horsemen to kill them. Apocalypse had been relocated into his chamber and he asked the ship \"Will there always be bad people trying to kill him\", to which the ship replied, \"Yes\". [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] managed to reach Apocalypse's chamber, but after seeing that Apocalypse was a child and had no idea of his former life, she fought Archangel, who wanted to kill the boy as he saw no rehabilitation could cleanse the nature of Apocalypse, and almost killed the boy, but found that he also could not do it. The group agreed to take the boy and train him, only for Fantomex to kill the boy by shooting him between his eyes.\n\n===Dark Angel Saga===\nClan Akkaba came together for the brief but eventful ascension and reign of Archangel their founder Apocalypses successor.{{r|Uncanny X-Force #11|18}} They would later welcome his [[Apocalypse Twins (Earth-616)|heirs]], who with their return after their kidnapping by [[Nathaniel Richards (Kang) (Earth-6311)|Kang]] would incinerate.{{r|Uncanny Avengers #5}}\n\n===Apocalypse Twins===\nThe Apocalypse Twins reappeared in their era when Genocide, the son of En Sabah Nur, and his Famine contacted a [[Celestial Gardeners (Earth-616)|Celestial Gardener]] in order to receive the [[Death Seed]] from it and replace Apocalypse as Archangel had before him. As the Gardener judged him worthy, [[Uriel (Mutant) (Earth-616)|Uriel]] and [[Eimin (Earth-616)|Eimin]] appeared. Using the axe [[Jarnbjorn]], Uriel killed the Celestial, and together, he and his sister defeated Genocide's forces. Using the Celestial Ship, they then destroyed the Peak.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 7}} They next traveled with [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] and [[Shiro Yoshida (Earth-616)|Sunfire]] to [[Akkaba Metropolis|Akkaba City]] to murder the remainder of Clan Akkaba and destroy the city.{{r|Uncanny Avengers Vol 1 8}}\n\n===[[Apocalypse Wars]]===\nSome members of Clan Akkaba joined Genocide in his plan to use [[Death-Flight (Earth-616)|Archangel's clones]] to ensure survival of the fittest around the globe, but their plan was thwarted by [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] and [[X-Men (Magneto's) (Earth-616)|his X-Men]].{{r|Uncanny X-Men Vol 4 7|10}}\n\nAnother section of Clan Akkaba found [[Piotr Rasputin (Earth-616)|Colossus]], now the [[War|Horseman of War]], after he was sent to them by the [[En Sabah Nur (Earth-16558)|Apocalypse]] from [[Earth-16558|A.D. 3167]].{{r|Extraordinary X-Men Vol 1 12}}\n\n==Customs==\n* '''Fittest'''\nClan Akkaba like everything else associated with Apocalypse incorporates his creed \u2018Survival of the fittest\u2019 into their core. Being deemed the fittest is a title of great honor among clan members. It signifies that the individual is closest to Apocalypse in terms of power, it also means that the individual leads Clan Akkaba in Apocalypse\u2019s absence/hibernation. To achieve the title one would have to undergo many tests and trials and ultimately battle any who questioned them and their rank. \n\n* '''The Inner Council'''\nThe inner Council of Clan Akkaba were the leaders of the clan and those showing great skill or possessing enough of Apocalypse\u2019s blood to be next in line or challenge the fittest for his/her title.\n\n* '''Summoning'''\nThis ritual is only performed during times of great peril. Normally the clan dealt with whatever threats presented itself to them but sometimes the clan itself was in peril or they faced extinction, in times like this Apocalypse was summoned. The consequence for asking for Apocalypse\u2019s help however was that one of the Inner council would be killed since asking for Apocalypse\u2019s help meant they were weak, the fittest should never have to ask for help.\n\n* '''Secrecy'''\nClan Akkaba, like many of Apocalypse's subordinates, is surrounded by secrecy. In case of death, the clan removes their mark from the dead ensuring none will know of them. They don't speak about or refer to the clan outside of the safety of the clan house and never invite outsiders into their midst. Breaking these rules means death.\n\n* '''[[Glossary:Tattoo|Tattoo]]'''\nClan members are branded whether at birth or while very young. The amount of Apocalypse's blood found in the child's system or strength of the bloodline determines the size of the tattoo that one receives. This is seen in Hamilton and Chamber who have strong doses of Apocalypse's blood while the murdered members in the eighteenth century had a tiny tattoo right behind their ear.\nMembers possess a degree of Apocalypse's molecular rearrangement ability. Other members have shown to develop abilities such as to breathe fire ([[Jack Starsmore (Earth-616)|Jack Starsmore]]), teleportation ([[Blink]] and [[Frederick Slade]]), and even psionic blasts ([[Chamber]]).\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Characters by Family]]\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]\n[[Category:Egyptian Tribes]]\n[[Category:Apocalypse Cult]]\n[[Category:Mutant Organizations]]"
