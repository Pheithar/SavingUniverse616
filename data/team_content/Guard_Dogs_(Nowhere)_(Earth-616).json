Their primary task is to stop a race of [[Germs (Nowhere)|Germs]] that constantly invade the land to make the animals sick. However, they were ineffective against another threat to the land, the sentient tractor known as the [[Jeeper (Earth-616)|Jeeper]]. The Guard Dogs were seen in action by [[Jimmy Jankovicz (Earth-616)|Jimmy Jupiter]] during his visit to Barnyard Valley.{{r|Marvel Mystery Comics Vol 1 46}}\n\n| Equipment               = Each Guard Dog wears a combat helmet that resembles those used by American soldiers during [[World War II]].\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Each Guard Dog is armed with a ultraviolet flashlight.
