This team consisted of [[Duc No Tranh (Earth-616)|Bengal]], [[Terrance Ward (Earth-616)|Trauma]], [[Frank Schlichting (Earth-616)|Constrictor]], [[Mary Walker (Earth-616)|Mutant Zero]], and the [[Scarlet Spiders (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spiders]].\n\n''\"The Initiative program denies all knowledge of a special Black Ops Team. There is no pardon on file for the super-villain known as the Constrictor. No record of any dealings with the Vietnamese national codenamed Bengal. [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] cannot recall what became of his designs for the Iron Spider armor. And, most importantly, the Superhuman Armed Forces wishes to dispel all rumors of a 199th mutant. We repeat, there is no Mutant Zero. Mutant Zero does NOT exist. That is all.\"''\n\nThis Shadow Initiative was sent out by Gyrich to free the Initiative members captured by the [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|Hulk's]] [[Warbound]]; [[Elvin Haliday (Earth-616)|Rage]], [[Cloud 9]], [[Tsu-Zana (Earth-616)|Ultra Girl]], [[Thor Girl]], [[Steven Harmon (Earth-616)|Slapstick]] and [[Roger Brokeridge (Earth-616)|Hardball]]. On this assignment Bengal showed to be a perfect field leader of this Shadow Initiative.\n\nThe black ops group successfully rescued these captured trainees, while Trauma, their \"secret weapon\" tried to use his powers to scare the Hulk (becoming, in turn, the [[Emil Blonsky (Earth-616)|Abomination]], [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]], Brian Banner, and Bruce Banner) he failed to beat the Hulk, the Hulk beat him into unconsciousness, leaving Terrance alive to pass the message on to the others. Trauma later recuperated in the Initiative's medical bay. It is later revealed that the Scarlet Spiders are clones of [[Michael van Patrick (Earth-616)|Michael van Patrick]] (MVP),a deceased initiative recruit accidentally killed. The Scarlet Spiders are later taken off the Black Ops team after revealing themselves to the public and places with the other trainees.\n\nGyrich called them to protect him from [[Michael van Patrick (KIA) (Earth-616)|KIA]], but they lost and one of the Scarlet Spiders was killed, and Constrictor was badly maimed. Mutant Zero saved Gyrich and the remaining Scarlet Spiders continued the battle for their brother.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #10}} After KIA was defeated, the two remaining Scarlet Spiders left the Initiative to join [[Counter Force (Earth-616)|Counter Force]], a team of former [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]], MVP and these two, led by [[Vance Astrovik (Earth-616)|Justice]], while Constrictor was healed with two bionic hands.\n\nDuring the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull Invasion]], the Shadow Initiative stayed at Camp Hammond while most others of the Initiative went to fight the [[Skrull]]s in New York. Later the Skrulls used Camp Hammond as a base, which [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)]], discovers, having stayed behind out of cowardice. The Shadow Initiative tries to assassinate the Skrull Queen [[Veranke (Earth-616)|Veranke]], but is defeated and captured, except for Ant-Man. During this story it was revealed Mutant Zero is a red haired woman.{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #17}}\n\nAfter the events of the Secret Invasion, [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]] was added by Gauntlet to the Black-Ops team as their fieldleader. The first thing he did was discover Mutant Zero's true identity to be [[Mary Menzinis (Earth-616)|Typhoid Mary]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #20}} After some of the cadets graduated, [[James Santini (Earth-616)|Batwing]] was appointed to the Shadow Initiative. However since the Shadow Initiative, including [[Melati Kusuma (Earth-616)|Komodo]] was on an assignment to take down Hardball in Madripoor,{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #20}} Batwing will have to be patient to meet the rest of his team.\n\n==Membership==\n*[[Henry Gyrich (Earth-616)|Henry Peter Gyrich]]\n*[[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]]\n*[[Duc No Tranh (Earth-616)|Bengal]]\n*[[James Santini (Earth-616)|Batwing]]\n*[[Melati Kusuma (Earth-616)|Komodo]]\n*[[Emery Schaub (Earth-616)|Butterball]]\n*[[Badd Axe (Earth-616)|Badd Axe]]\n*[[Firearms (Earth-616)|Firearms]]\n*[[Keith Kraft (Earth-616)|Ringer]]\n\n[[Heavy Mettle (Earth-616)|Heavy Mettle]]\n*[[Stronghold (Heavy Mettle) (Earth-616)|Stronghold]]\n*[[Blackwing (Heavy Mettle) (Earth-616)|Blackwing]]\n*[[Barracuda (Heavy Mettle) (Earth-616)|Barracuda]]\n*[[Riot (Heavy Mettle) (Earth-616)|Riot]]\n*[[Warbow (Heavy Mettle) (Earth-616)|Warbow]]\n\nFormer members:\n*[[Mary Menzinis (Earth-616)|Mutant Zero]]\n*[[Frank Schlichting (Earth-616)|Constrictor]]\n*[[Terrance Ward (Earth-616)|Trauma]]\n*[[Scarlet Spiders (Earth-616)|Scarlet Spiders/Red Team]]\n*[[Slaughter Boy (Earth-616)|Slaughter Boy]]\n*[[Jonathan Logan (Earth-616)|Johnny Guitar]]\n*[[Jack Dulouz (Earth-616)|Doctor Sax]]\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = Although [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]] was not an official member of the team,{{r|Heroic Age: Heroes #1}}{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #3}}, he was considered as kind of part of it during the [[Secret Invasion]],{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #3}} and his promotion to the [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]] as a loss by [[Duc No Tranh (Earth-616)|Bengal]].{{r|Avengers: The Initiative #20}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:50-State Initiative]]"
