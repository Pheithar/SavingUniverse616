Having rebelled against him as well as nature, they had begun \"feeding\" on gods, in fact having intercourse with [[Sigurd (Bor) (Earth-616)|Sigurd]] and his troop. Once discovered, they were cast out from all realms, existing in the spaces between realms in spirit-form alone. Due to the nature of their crime, Bor cursed them, only to consume the shades of gods exiled from their true homes, so they would be hungry forever.{{citation}}\n\n===Siege===\nDuring the [[Siege (Event)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]], the D\u00edsir tried to feed on the Asgardians who were slain, but soon made a quick retreat when encountering [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Valkyrie (Dani Moonstar)]].{{citation}}\n\n===Servants of Mephisto===\n[[Loki Laufeyson (Kid Loki) (Earth-616)|Kid Loki]] gained control of them and bartered their services to [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] in exchange for him granting [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]] a small corner of his realm for her to establish a new [[Hel]].{{citation}}\n\n===[[Fear Itself]]===\nFour D\u00edsir were given to Kid Loki to assist him against the [[Cul Borson (Earth-616)|Serpent]]: [[Br\u00fcn (Earth-616)|Br\u00fcn]], [[Hl\u00f6kk (Earth-616)|Mad Hl\u00f6kk]], [[K\u00e1ra (Earth-616)|K\u00e1ra of the Twilight]], and [[G\u00f6ndul (Earth-616)|G\u00f6ndul the Fool]].{{citation}}\n\n===New Mutants===\nThanks to the manipulations of Kid Loki, the D\u00edsir were eventually freed from their curse by Bor, returning to their old selves. They became the personal Valkyries of Hela and swore that, upon his death, they would take vengeance on Sigurd for his past crimes.{{citation}}\n\n===Asgard's Assassin===\nAfter [[Aldrif Odinsdottir (Earth-616)|Angela]] kidnapped [[Laussa Odinsdottir (Earth-616)|her own sister]]{{r|Angela: Asgard's Assassin Vol 1 1}} and disappeared with her from the all-seeing [[Heimdall (Earth-616)|Heimdall]]'s sight, [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Odinson]] went to Hel to ask for Hela's help to capture his rogue sister and rescue the baby. Hela helped them by calling the D\u00edsir so they could hunt Angela.{{r|Angela: Asgard's Assassin Vol 1 3}}\n\nOdinson cried their name and it raced to all corners of creation. Angela was heading to [[Heven (Tenth Realm)|Heven]] with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'s help when she heard Odinson's cry, only her being able to hear it. She then repeated it, inadvertently summoning the D\u00edsir into the [[Cool Interstellar Travel Travelship|Guardians' ship]]. A fierce battle ensued between the D\u00edsir and the Guardians. While her sisters were battling the Guardians, Br\u00fcn worked out the ship's location and revealed to the Guardians that the baby Angela was carrying with her was the kidnapped newborn baby of [[Odin Borson (Earth-616)|Odin]] and [[Freyja Freyrdottir (Earth-616)|Freyja]] before being decapitated.{{r|Angela: Asgard's Assassin Vol 1 4}}\n\nFollowing Angela's explanation of what was happening to the Guardians, they threw the D\u00edsir, who were left in pieces (literally), into space, from where Hela recovered them. In Hel, Br\u00fcn told Hela and Odinson that Angela was taking the girl to [[Heven (Tenth Realm)|Heven]], and so the Odinson went to save his sister.{{r|Angela: Asgard's Assassin Vol 1 5}}\n\n===War of the Realms===\nDuring the [[War of the Realms]], the D\u00edsir were recruited by the [[Amora (Earth-616)|Enchantress]] behind Hela's back to further her conquest of [[South America]] on the promise of freedom. Their attention was caught by the [[Champions (Earth-616)|Champions]], who fought to push back the [[Draugr (Race)|Draugr]]'s forces in [[S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier]], [[Brazil]]. The D\u00edsir managed to overpower the young heroes until their very existence began to power up [[V\u00edctor \u00c1lvarez (Earth-616)|Power Man]]. His abilities allowed him to absorb ambient cultural energy, and worked specifically well with ancient beings such as the D\u00edsir. Following their defeat, the D\u00edsir teleported back to Hel, where they were forced to answer to Hela for their treachery.{{r|Champions Vol 3 6}} \n\n==Powers and Abilities==\n===Powers===\nAs Valkyries, the D\u00edsir possess the conventional abilities of an Asgardian god including class 30 Superhuman Strength and enhanced durability. Several of them possess additional powers such as skills in magic. All are trained in a variety of weapons and can use teamwork to defeat much stronger opponents.{{citation}}\n\nIn their cursed state, the D\u00edsir were immune to all damage except the \"souls\" of others. Most passed right through them and blows from Thor's hammer barely affected them. They could instantly be summoned by anyone who called their groups name regardless of barriers in place, slice their target to pieces, and depart without anyone noticing.{{citation}}\n\n===Weaknesses===\n* The D\u00edsir are cannibalistic in nature, and can only consume the spirit-forms of Asgardian gods.{{r|Thor Vol 1 611}}\n* Their curse prevented them from entering either [[Valhalla (Afterlife)|Valhalla]] or Hel.{{citation}}\n* They have been shown to be destroyed by the sword [[Eir-Gram]], given to [[Danielle Moonstar (Earth-616)|Valkyrie (Dani Moonstar)]] by [[Hela (Earth-616)|Hela]].{{citation}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Asgardian Organizations]]\n[[Category:Cannibals]]"
