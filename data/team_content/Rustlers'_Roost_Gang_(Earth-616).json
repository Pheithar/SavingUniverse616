After rustling and selling of the Lazy S Ranch's herd, Staley and company attempted to steal the heard Bar 3 Ranch, only to be caught in an ambush by the Bar 3 ranch hands. In their escape attempt, most of the gang's low-level riders were shot or captured and sent to jail.\n\nThe blunder at the Bar 3 Ranch caused Staley's second in command [[Crow Kessler (Earth-616)|Crow Kessler]] to question his leadership. So, the two gang members had a quick-draw contest to determine who was worthy to lead the crew, but they were interrupted by Marshal [[Sandy Sandlin (Earth-616)|Sandy Sandlin]], who shot gang member [[Little Augie (Earth-616)|Little Augie]] dead. Sandlin then took the remaining gang members to jail, where all the surviving members were sentenced to death by hanging.{{r|3-D Tales of the West Vol 1 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Horses\n| Weapons                 = Handguns\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
