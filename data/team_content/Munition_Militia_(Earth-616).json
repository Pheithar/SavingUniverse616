To this end, they outfitted themselves with hi-tech weapons bought from the [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]].\n\nWhen the Munition Militia prepared to strike and cause a diversion while a truck charged with explosives detonated in another part of the city, [[Matthew Murdock (Earth-616)|Daredevil]] stopped them with the help of [[Luke Cage (Earth-616)|Luke Cage]] and [[Maya Lopez (Earth-616)|Echo]]. As soon as he learned of the explosives, Daredevil and his allies tracked it down and crashed it into the [[East River]]. Unfortunately, while the heroes were busy with the explosives, all members of the Munition Militia escaped, with the exception of [[Simon Slugansky (Earth-616)|Slug]], who was overseeing the truck's explosion and was subsequently captured.{{r|Daredevil Vol 5 21}}\n\nThe Munition Militia broke into the New York State Supreme Court while Slug was in trial in an attempt to break him free. They were stopped by Daredevil, who had attended the trial as a witness.{{r|Daredevil Vol 5 22}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Terrorist Organizations]]"
