They then became freelance mercenaries, but remained loyal to Wakanda.{{Citation}}\n\nAfter the assassination of [[T'Chaka (Earth-616)|T'Chaka]] at the [[Bilderberg Conference (Earth-616)|Bilderberg Conference]], the Wakandan Security Forces were sent there to look for the people responsible of that attack: a band of mercenaries hired by the Bilderberg Conference members and led by [[Ulysses Klaw (Earth-616)|Klaw]].{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 3}}\n\n===Detaining Invaders===\nAfter Klaw's attempted invasion of Wakanda, [[Aleksei Sytsevich (Earth-616)|Rhino]] and [[Augustine du Lac (Earth-616)|Black Knight]] were kept in custody of the Wakandan Security Forces, and extradition demands from the [[United States of America]] and the [[Catholic Church (Earth-616)|Vatican]] were denied.{{r|Black Panther Vol 4 10}}\n\n===[[Wakanda|Wakandan]]/[[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantean]] War===\nThe Hatut Zeraze were used by [[Shuri (Earth-616)|Shuri]] as a strike force to assault [[Atlantis (Modern)|Atlantis]], but both sides were decimated by an alien invasion.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 8}} They were used many times throughout the Wakandan/Atlantean War,{{Citation}} as well as during the events of [[Infinity (Event)|Infinity]].{{Citation}} They grew angry with their former king, T'Challa, and when they were given the chance, they accused him of being a coward. It was because of their accusations that Shuri made the decision to banish T'Challa from Wakanda.{{r|New Avengers Vol 3 12}} Some Hatut Zeraze were made into [[Glossary:Cyborg|cyborgs]] and sent to kill [[Namor McKenzie (Earth-616)|Namor]]; however, the sender is unknown. If it wasn't for the [[Otto Octavius (Earth-616)|Superior Spider-Man]] intervening, they would have succeeded in assassinating Namor.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Team-Up Vol 1 8}}\n\n===[[Empyre (Event)|Empyre]]===\nDuring the [[Cotati]] [[Empyre (Earth-616)|Empyre]] invasion, [[White Wolf (Hunter) (Earth-616)|White Wolf]] and the Hatut Zeraze engaged the Cotati archers south of Khartoum.{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 2}}\n| Equipment               = The Hatut Zeraze employ the following standard equipment:\n\n*'''Vibranium Microweave Mesh''':  A Hatut Zeraze uniform incorporates a vibranium microweave mesh that robs incoming objects of their momentum. Bullets do not ricochet off but simply fall to the ground when they come in contact with the weave. Likewise, a Hatut Zeraze cannot be stabbed; however, the costume (and the Zeraze) can be cut if the attacker slashes along the uniform's grain.\n\n*'''Cloaking Technology''': A Hatut Zeraze's uniform is equipped with advanced cloaking technology which can render the user invisible.  \n\n*'''Energy-Dampening Boots''': Energy regulators create varying fields from the Vibranium in the molded soles of a Hatut Zeraze's boots, enabling him to survive a fall of several stories and land like a cat. Given enough momentum, a Hatut Zeraze can also run on walls or skim across water. The field can be also used offensively to shatter or weaken objects.\n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = Various high-powered weapons\n| Notes                   = * Their name is pronounced \"Ha-'''too''' Sir-'''ah'''-say.\"{{r|Black Panther Annual Vol 2 1}}\n* The name Hatut Zeraze translates from Wakandan to \"Dogs of War\".{{r|Empyre: Avengers Vol 1 2}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Wakandan Organizations]]\n[[Category:Government Organizations]]\n[[Category:Mercenaries]]"
