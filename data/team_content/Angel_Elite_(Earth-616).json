These warriors serve as internal defense and security forces. At one point in the war with the renegade [[Spaceknights (Second Generation) (Earth-616)|Second Generation Spaceknights]], the last three Angels remaining on Galador were slain in battle before [[Rom (Earth-616)|Rom]] and the [[Spaceknight Squadron (Earth-616)|Spaceknight Squadron]] could defeat the renegades. Once the location of Galador was reestablished, the forces were rebuilt from units elsewhere in the Empire. Though genetically superior to normal Galadorians, only one Angel, [[Val (Earth-616)|Val (Sentry)]] was compatible with and able to undergo grafting to Spaceknight armor. The current Clan Chief is [[Talo (Galadorian) (Earth-616)|Talo]].{{Citation}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Each Angel had wings for flight\n| Weapons                 = [[Horn of Heaven]], [[Judgement Staves]]\n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Galadorian Organizations]]"
