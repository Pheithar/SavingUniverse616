While on patrol, he discovered the gang and their rivals about to get into a gang fight, both equipped with high-tech weaponry. He intervened and interrogated one of them at a hospital, after which he discovered that the [[Animus (Hate-Monger) (Earth-616)|Hate-Monger]] and the [[Sons of the Serpent (Earth-616)|Sons of the Serpent]] were supplying them the high tech firearms.{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 2 100}}\n\nWar Machine convinced the gang to help him take down Hate Monger's gunrunning/drug distribution operation. They ambushed the Sons of the Serpents, taking their guns and uniforms. They then made it appear as if the Sons of the Serpent had double-crossed [[Hydra (Earth-616)|Hydra]] (which was supplying them with the drugs) and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]] (whom were supplying them with the weapons). War Machine then convinced both Hydra and AIM to help them shut down Hate Monger's operation.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 1 152|155}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Gangs]]\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]"
