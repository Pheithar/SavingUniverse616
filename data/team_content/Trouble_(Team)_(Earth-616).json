The Avengers were eventually defeated by the combined force of Trouble and Graviton, though Zzzax had been dispersed and lost.\n\nAfter that Graviton moved on with his plan but without knowing that Tigra had infiltrated in his base under her secret identity. Disguised as one of the guards, Tigra led Halflife to believe that Quantum wanted to kill her, and vice versa.
