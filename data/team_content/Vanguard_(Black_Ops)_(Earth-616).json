Later, Craft has redonned his uniform as Colonel America and completed another mission, talking to his handler and referring to a new, male-version of Retcon, who presumably has similar powers.{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 2 #12}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
