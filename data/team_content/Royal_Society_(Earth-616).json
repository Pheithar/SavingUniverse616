It was created to promote science and its benefits and providing scientific advice for policy, fostering international cooperation.\n\n===Events===\nIn the 18th century; former leader of the Royal Society; [[Isaac Newton (Earth-616)|Sir Isaac Newton]] murdered other members of the group such as [[John Flamsteed (Earth-616)|John Flamsteed]], [[Robert Hooke (Earth-616)|Robert Hooke]], [[John Locke (Earth-616)|John Locke]].{{r|S.H.I.E.L.D.: Infinity Vol 1 1}}\n\n[[File:Royal_Society_(Earth-616)_from_Further_Adventures_of_Cyclops_and_Phoenix_Vol_1_1_003.jpg|left|thumb]]\nIn the 19th century [[Nathaniel Essex (Earth-616)|Dr. Nathaniel Essex]] an [[Oxford University]] educated biologist developed advanced theories on human evolution and was obsessed with [[Charles Darwin (Earth-616)|Charles Darwin\u2019s]] theory of evolution, though he felt Darwin and his contemporaries were shackled by too many moral constraints and that science was beyond morality. Dr. Essex dreamed of bringing the perfection of the evolution of the human race to the masses. As a member of London's Royal Society, Dr. Essex was regarded, by some, to be the greatest scientific mind of his generation, and, by others, as a dangerous man twisted by the obsession of his own research. {{r|Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #1}}\n\nDr. Essex believed in Darwin's theory of evolution and discovered that humanity was undergoing increasing mutation, due to what he called the \"[[Essex Factor]]\" in the human genome. Dr. Essex also believed that, in the offspring of certain racially superior individuals, these parcels will, within a hundred years or so, [[mutate]]. {{r|Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #1}}\n\nDr. Essex's presented his theories to the Royal Society and was  mocked, making him bitter, and his revealing of an unorthodox experiment resulted in his ousting from the Royal Society. Even Darwin himself suggested that Dr. Essex see a physician due to the trauma of losing his son. Angry, Dr. Essex stated to Darwin that if becoming a monster was what was required for science to progress, then he would become a monster.{{r|Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #1}}\n[[File:Royal_Society_(Earth-616)_from_Further_Adventures_of_Cyclops_and_Phoenix_Vol_1_1_004.jpg|right|thumb]]\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society\n}}\n[[Category:British Organizations]]\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:Think Tanks]]"
