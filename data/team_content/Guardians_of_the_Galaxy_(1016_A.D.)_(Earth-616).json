However, their visions came into conflict when Tyreeze's sociopathic tendencies have surfaced. He and Stella had a falling out, and she would bear facial scars as a reminder. Stella had then reformed the Guardians with the new members while Tyreeze went on to think bigger and eventually constructed an esodimensional [[Structure]] existing outside space and time, in which he spend untold number of years building an army of [[Highbreeds]] by conquering and assimilating entire cultures.{{r|Guardians of Infinity Vol 1 6}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * Within the same issues, the \"present\" year on this team is repeatedly referred to as both 1000 A.D. in the panel captions and 1016 A.D. on the recap pages. {{cl|Empyre Handbook Vol 1 1}} lists [[Stella Nega (Earth-616)|Stella Nega]] as the \"Leader of Guardians of the Galaxy of 1016 A.D.\", so that date is considered accurate on this page.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
