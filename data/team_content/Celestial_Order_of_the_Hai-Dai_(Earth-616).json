They also targeted Zheng Zu's son [[Shang-Chi (Earth-616)|Shang-Chi]], another ingredient for that.<!-- {{r|Secret Avengers #6}} -->\n\nThey next set up a trap at an exhibit of ancient Chinese art in the [[International Finance Centre]] in [[Hong Kong]] where [[Secret Avengers (Black Ops Unit) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]], including Shang-Chi, went, believing one of the gems was there.{{r|Secret Avengers #6}} The Hai-Dai captured Shang-Chi and brought him onto their plane to execute him, but [[Eric O'Grady (Earth-616)|Ant-Man]], hidden in Shang-Chi's hair, caused the plane to crash.{{r|Secret Avengers #7}}\n\nThey soon led an attack in broad daylight in downtown Hong Kong, led by Zheng Zu, as part of a trick. As the Secret Avengers intervened, Shadow Council agents [[Max Fury (Earth-616)|Max Fury]] and [[John Steele (American Soldier) (Earth-616)|John Steele]] to capture [[Sharon Carter (Earth-616)|Sharon Carter]], to exchange her for Shang-Chi. As soon as she was captive, the Hai-Dai and Zheng Zu vanished.{{r|Secret Avengers #8}}\n\nShang-Chi was finally captured, and brought to the [[Sacred Temple of Zheng-Zu]], in [[China]], where Black Council and Hai-Dai guarded over him before the ritual's completion. The Secret Avengers intervened in the course of the ritual, stopping it. The Hai-Dai weren't seen during the ensuing battle, in which Zheng Zu was killed.{{r|Secret Avengers #10}}\n\nShang-Chi trained [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] at an abandoned Hai-Dai training facility in [[Croton-on-Hudson]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #664}}\n\nLater, led by Zheng Zu's daughter [[Zheng Bao Yu (Earth-616)|Zheng Bao Yu]], they set up a lab under [[Chinatown (New York)|Chinatown]], in [[New York City]], where they continued a long-forgotten experiment of Zheng Zu by bio-engineering [[Brood (Race)|Brood]] (or rather \"genetic mutations spawned from tainted Brood DNA\"), which they used for assassinations, until the [[Defenders (Valkyrior) (Earth-616)|Defenders]] Valkyrie and [[Mercedes Knight (Earth-616)|Misty Knight]] recruited [[Elsa Bloodstone (Earth-616)|Elsa Bloodstone]] in their inquiry about monsters in Chinatown, and tracked down the lab. During the fight against the Brood, Hai Dai, and Zheng Bao Yu, the Defenders were joined by [[No-Name (Earth-616)|No-Name of Brood]].{{r|Fearless Defenders #8}}\n\nIt was later revealed by [[Zheng Shi-Hua (Earth-616)|Shi-Hua]] that the Si-Fan, along with the [[Celestial Order of the Si-Fan (Earth-616)|Order of the Si-Fan]] and the [[Order of the Golden Dawn (Earth-616)|Order of the Golden Dawn]], were aliases used for the [[Five Weapons Society (Earth-616)|Five Weapons Society]], much like how Fu Manchu was an alias for Zheng Zu.{{r|Shang-Chi Vol 1 2}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * It is unclear whether the Celestial Order of the Hai-Dai is another name for the [[Celestial Order of the Si-Fan (Earth-616)|Celestial Order of the Si-Fan]] (to further distancing the modern [[Zheng Zu (Earth-616)|Zheng Zu]] from his [[Fu Manchu]] origin as non-Marvel-created content), or if they are an independent group.\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Criminal Organizations]]\n[[Category:Chinese Organizations]]\n[[Category:Five Weapons Society]]"
