Alchemax provides chemical, plastic, and agricultural products and services to consumer markets that include food, transportation, health and medicine, personal care. The President and CEO of Alchemax is industrialist [[Elizabeth Allan (Earth-616)|Liz Allan]].\n\n===Origin===\nThe company was created after Liz Allan's company \"[[Allan Chemical (Earth-616)|Allan Chemical]]\" was merged with stocks inherited by her son Normie from [[Oscorp (Earth-616)|Oscorp]] and the last remaining properties of [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon Lab]] after its destruction, establishing it under the new name of \"Alchemax\".{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 19}}\n\nIt was later revealed that Norman Osborn, under the guise of \"Mason Banks,\" created the corporation in order to leave a strong empire for his grandson and establish an empire for the Osborn legacy. Following his defeat, Osborn was able to escape custody due to Liz \"accidentally\" activating a Spider-Sense jammer, prompting Spider-Man to keep tabs on them.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 31}} \n\nAlso, [[Miguel O'Hara (Earth-928)|Spider-Man (Michael O'Mara)]], [[Tiberius Stone (Earth-616)|Ty Stone]]'s [[Earth-928|future]] grandson from a timeline where [[Alchemax (Earth-928)|Alchemax]] controlled society, started working undercover in the nascent Alchemax.{{r|Spider-Man 2099 Vol 2 1}}\n\n===Alchemax Genetics===\nA division of Alchemax under the leadership of [[Robert Chandler (Earth-616)|Robert Chandler]] called Alchemax Genetics created ten clones of [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|Laura Kinney]], though they were considered failures as they did not inherit her healing factor or claws. [[Sisters (Earth-616)|Four of the girls]] later escaped with the help of [[Kimura (Earth-616)|Kimura]], and began targeting Alchemax and its employees using equipment she provided. Kimura wanted revenge against Alchemax Genetics for stealing technology she considered her property, while the girls sought vengeance for the treatment they endured at their creators' hands. Chandler requested Wolverine's assistance in stopping the escapees, but when confronted, three of the girls \u2014 Gabby, Bellonna, and Zelda \u2014 claimed that they had nothing to do with the destruction of the installation where they were being kept and were merely trying to escape. However before they could reveal anything further, Laura and her \"sisters\" were attacked by Captain Mooney, Alchemax Genetics' head of security, who attempted to kill the girls alongside [[Anthony Masters (Earth-616)|Taskmaster]].\n\nHow much Alchemax's corporate headquarters knew about Chandler's activities is unknown. However Chandler expressed significant concern to Mooney about what might happen once his superiors learned the truth about their project after repeated, and very public, failures to recapture the clones.\n\nAlchemax Genetics was ultimately destroyed by Wolverine and The Sisters, with Laura tipping off [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] and [[Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division (Earth-616)|S.H.I.E.L.D.]] of their activities and location.{{r|All-New Wolverine Vol 1 1|6}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = Limos \n| Weapons                 = [[Spider-Slayer Mark XXI|Spider-Slayers]], Spider-Jammers\n| Notes                   = * Alchemax was the majority shareholder of [[Horizon Labs (Earth-616)|Horizon Labs]].\n* Their headquarters are housed in [[Oscorp Tower]], the former base of [[Oscorp (Earth-616)|Oscorp]].\n| Trivia                  = * This Alchemax would grow to become the [[Alchemax (Earth-928)|mega corporation]] that would eventually control most aspects of daily life in a possible future.{{r|Spider-Man 2099 Vol 1 1}}\n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Peter Parker (Earth-616)/Quotes]]\n[[Category:Norman Osborn (Earth-616)/Quotes]]\n[[Category:Companies]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]"
