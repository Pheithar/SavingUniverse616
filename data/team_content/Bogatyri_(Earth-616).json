Despite the initial defeat of Wolverine and the Avengers West Coast, the heroes rallied and the Scarlet Witch succeeded in destroying the \"Quick Freeze Crystal.\" All four of the Bogatyri managed to escape, but apparently disbanded soon afterwards.{{r|Avengers West Coast Vol 2 87|88}}\n\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = * [[All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe 2|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z #2 (2006)]]\n* http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/bogatyriawc.htm \n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogatyri_(comics)\n}}"
