They used the work of [[National Socialist German Workers Party (Earth-616)|Nazi]] scientist and rocket expert; [[Wernher von Braun (Earth-616)|Wernher von Braun]] who was recruited to the US by the CIA as part of [[Operation Paperclip (Earth-616)|Operation Paperclip]].{{r|Agents of Atlas Vol 2 2}}\n\n===Moon Landing===\nProject Apollo achieved that objective in July 1969, when [[Neil Armstrong (Earth-616)|Neil Armstrong]] and [[Edwin Aldrin Jr (Earth-616)|Buzz Aldrin]] walked on the moon, they were unaware that his mission was jeopardized by the [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]], aliens trying to undermine the space program on Earth as part of a future invasion. This plot was thwarted by the [[First Line (Earth-616)|First Line]] a group of American super-heroes who were active in the late 20th century.{{r|Marvel: The Lost Generation #6}} with five more successful lunar landing missions through 1972.\n\n===Skylab===\nAfter the Skylab{{r|Ms. Marvel #3}} and Apollo-Soyuz Test Projects of the mid-1970s, NASA's human spaceflight efforts again resumed in 1981, with the Space Shuttle program that continued for thirty years.\n\nThe [[Space Shuttle Challenger]] launched and landed nine times before breaking apart 73 seconds into its tenth mission, 51-L, on January 28, 1986, resulting in the death of all seven crew members, including a civilian school teacher.{{r|Captain America: Man Out of Time #3}}\n\n===Modern Era===\n===Zankor===\n[[Zankor (Earth-616)|Zankor]] a confused alien with amnesia believed himself to be a human looking for an alien who was lost on earth after a frantic search for the disguised alien. The truth eventually was revealed after he took it to scientists at NASA and a young [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]] realized that the log was in an alien language at which point Zankor also realized the truth but was captured.{{r|Amazing Adult Fantasy #7}}{{r|Marvel: The Lost Generation #11|12}}\n\n===Celestial Godship===\n[[Matt Durgan (Earth-616)|Major Matt Durgan]] and [[Terry Parker (Earth-616)|Terry Parker]] were the [[United States of America|U.S.]] astronauts selected to approach and survey the [[Celestials|Celestial Godship]].{{r|Eternals #13}}\n\n===Ben Grimm===\n[[Benjamin Grimm (Earth-616)|Ben Grimm]] was recruited from [[United States Air Force (Earth-616)|US Airforce]] to become a test pilot and astronaut for NASA. [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Dr. Reed Richards]] recruited Ben to pilot his new experimental rocket ship, the ''[[Marvel-1]]'', after reminding him him of his promise to pilot his first spacecraft he invented.{{r|Fantastic Four #11}}\n\n===John Jameson===\n[[John Jonah Jameson III (Earth-616)|Col. John Jameson]], son of newspaper mogul [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]], was one of the youngest applicants to ever be accepted into NASA's astronaut program. During his first mission, in which he was to orbit Earth, the Forward Guidance Package on Jameson's capsule broke off in space, which caused the craft to spin out of control and plummet back down toward earth. The fledgling adventurer, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], who had just begun his career weeks earlier, managed to rescue Jameson by getting a replacement guidance module and attaching it to the falling capsule. John was then able to land the craft safely. This incident, which Jameson's father construed as a publicity stunt to upstage his son's accomplishment, provoked the one of elder Jameson's first editorial denouncements of Spider-Man.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #1}}On a later space mission, Jameson somehow contracted an unknown virus presumably during a space walk. Upon his return to Earth, Jameson began to develop superhuman strength as a side effect of the virus. Jameson was given a special body suit designed to keep his strength in check by scientists at NASA. But after a miss understanding with Spider-Man he was later cured..{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #42}}\n\n===Carol Danvers===\n[[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol Danvers]] was recruited by N.A.S.A to become head of security which she accepted, resigning from the [[United States Air Force (Earth-616)|Air Force]] bumping her to full Colonel at retirement. Becoming the youngest security captain in NASA's history, she became embroiled in the schemes of the interstellar alien [[Kree Empire]].{{r|Marvel Super-Heroes #13}} It was during this time that she met and eventually befriended the [[Kree]] soldier [[Mar-Vell (Earth-616)|Mar-Vell]] whose enemies would soon be responsible for her future transformation. The next few months were disastrous as she was kidnapped by the alien robotic intelligence [[Cyberex (Earth-616)|Cyberex]]{{r|Captain Marvel #1|9}} and then hospitalized by a controlled [[Iron Man (Anthony \"Tony\" Stark)|Iron Man]] who attacked the Cape.{{r|Captain Marvel #10|14}} The alien [[Yon-Rogg (Earth-616)|Yon-Rogg]] then kidnapped her while she was still concussed and eventually battled Mar-Vell. During this battle, Carol was knocked into a damaged Kree [[Psyche-Magnitron]], a powerful device which could turn imagination into reality. Carol's genetic structure was altered effectively making her a half-Kree superhuman, later becoming the hero \"Ms. Marvel\" and later \"Captain Marvel\".{{r|Captain Marvel #16|18}}\n\n===Peter Quill===\n[[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Peter Quill]]'s friend Lisa, a NASA commander, got him a job as a mechanic in the NASA Ops Launch Facility in [[California (State)|California]]. Once there, Peter started training in secret with the simulators during all his free time. One day, after an altercation with an important Astronaut, Lisa had no choice but to discharge Peter from his position at the facility. Feeling this was his last chance to get to space, he stole a Kree ship, managed to outfly the security of the station, and left Earth.{{r|Star-Lord #1}}\n\n===Privatization===\n[[Tesseract (Earth-616)|Tesseract]] C.E.O. [[Stewart Acheron (Earth-616)|Stewart Acheron]] announced that his corporation was acquiring NASA, in an unprecedented move that would lead to the privatization of the agency.{{r|Silver Surfer Vol 5 1}}\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = * One story suggests that the [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] protected Apollo 11 mission from the [[Kree]] [[Sentry 9168 (Earth-616)|Sentry #9168]]. However, per the [[Glossary:Sliding Timescale|Sliding Timescale]] of Earth-616 this should be considered a topical reference.{{r|Fantastic Four #98}} A later story also suggests that the Apollo 11 team found a device left on the moon by [[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom]] while exploring the Moon. This too should also be considered a topical reference per the Sliding Timescale.{{r|Astonishing Tales Vol 2 1}}\n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Historical Organizations]]\n[[Category:American Organizations]]"
