[[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]], who soon became their arch-enemy, later interrupted them and defeated the team. The Chameleon, then, hired the [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Scorpion]] and the [[Luis Alvarez (Earth-616)|Tarantula]] to defeat the now powerless Spider-Man along with the four other women. Teaming up with [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]], Spider-Man defeated all the culprits, but they all were able to escape.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 340|343}}\n\nAfter their defeat, the Femme Fatales agreed to [[Deidre Wentworth (Earth-616)|Superia]]'s invitation to join the [[Femizons (Earth-616)|Femizons]] and fought [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]].{{r|Captain America Vol 1 389|391}} They attended an auction for the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom Symbiote]].{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man Vol 1 6}} [[Beatta Dubiel (Earth-616)|Bloodlust]] lost her powers after [[Decimation]].{{r|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol 1 4}}\n\nBloodlust and [[Danielle Forte (Earth-616)|Mindblast]] turn up imprisoned in [[Pleasant Hill]]. During a takeover instigated by the prisoners, Bloodlust and Mindblast were turned into duplicates of [[Maria Hill (Earth-616)|Maria Hill]] by the living [[Cosmic Cube]] [[Kobik (Earth-616)|Kobik]] in order to fool the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] and [[Avengers Unity Division (Earth-616)|Avengers Unity Division]].{{r|All-New, All-Different Avengers Vol 1 8}}\n\nWhile searching for the missing body of [[James Howlett (Earth-616)|Wolverine]], the [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]] and their allies [[Elizabeth Braddock (Earth-616)|Psylocke]] and [[Neena Thurman (Earth-616)|Domino]] came to [[Madripoor]] to interview [[Max Eisenhardt (Earth-616)|Magneto]] for any info he had. Magneto turned out to be a telepathic illusion generated by Mindblast, which was to lure the mutants into a trap organized by the Femme Fatales, which now included [[Ophelia Sarkissian (Earth-616)|Viper]] and [[Sapphire Styx (Earth-616)|Sapphire Styx]].{{r|Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor Vol 1 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = S.S.
