Dr. Power discovered a new power source, the [[Anti-Matter Engine]]. Very efficient and ecologically clean, it had the potential downside of destroying whatever planet it was on.{{r|Power Pack Vol 4 1}}\n\nThe night before the generator was due to be tested, [[Aelfyre Whitemane (Earth-616)|Aelfyre Whitemane (\"Whitey\")]] (a member of the alien race known as the [[Kymellians]]) crash landed not far from the Power's home. The kids investigated and met a mortally wounded Aelfrye.{{citation}} He explained how his home planet of Kymellia was destroyed by the same device the children's father had built,{{r|Power Pack Vol 4 1}} and how his conveyance, the sentient [[SmartShip]] [[Smartship Friday (Earth-616)|Friday]], had been shot down by an alien race called the{{citation}} [[Zn'rx]] (or \"Snarks\") who coveted the device for it's aforementioned planet destruction capabilities.{{r|Power Pack Vol 4 1}} Another account by [[Katherine Power (Earth-616)|Katie Power]] mentioned Whitey being shot and killed by the Zn'rx after he landed on Earth.{{r|Power Pack Vol 4 1}}\n\nAelfrye also revealed that his species has certain abilities over fundamental forces, and that these abilities could be passed from one person to another at the point of the first person's death.{{citation}} Aelfrye split his powers evenly between the four children,{{r|Power Pack Vol 4 1}} and commanded his SmartShip to watch over them.{{citation}}\n\nVarying accounts exist on whether the Power parents were aware{{r|Power Pack Vol 2 1}} or not{{r|Power Pack Vol 4 1}} of their children's powers and adventures.<!-- retcon? to be removed from history text-->\n\n===Jakal's return<!-- will likely be to be changed once more of the early stories, not all connected to Snarkwars IIRC, will be added-->===\nMeanwhile, the Snarks kidnapped their parents. Using their new found powers of gravity manipulation (Gee/Alex), acceleration and flight (Lightspeed/Julie), mass (Mass Master/Jack), and energy (Energizer/Katie) the Power kids rescued their parents and defeated the Snarks.{{citation}}<!-- incomplete: \n[Adventures, Jakal and Maraud defeated, Franklin Richards, Bogerman, Deadpool, etc.]-->\n\nThe Power family later relocated to [[Bainbridge Island]] due to their father's being hired by the local school.{{r|Power Pack Vol 2 1}}\n\nAs [[Jakal (Earth-616)|Jakal]] returned and was set on eradicating any Zn'rx resistance to him, as well as destroy the Power Pack, attack [[Kymellia II|Kymellia]] and restore the [[Zn'rx Empire]] at his former strength and bellicosity, [[Kofi Whitemane (Earth-616)|Kofi Whitemane]] and [[Sobak (Earth-616)|Prince Sobak]], High Snark of the [[Ankar Clan (Earth-616)|Ankar Clan]] and chosen successor by [[Bhadsha (Earth-616)|Emperor Bhadsha]], went to Earth, helping them to defeat the [[Maraud Clan (Earth-616)|Maraud]] warriors, before returning to [[Snark World]] to oppose Jakal's plans.{{r|Power Pack Vol 2 1|4}}<!-- can be expanded. some of the links should appear earlier in the text-->\n\n===Splits and reunions===\nAfter Power Pack helped defeat the returned [[Jakal (Earth-616)|Jakal]] and ensure a more peaceful transition for [[Snark World]] (Julie proposed that a triumvirate ruling corps replace, which was adopted at least in the transition meantime), Jack, uninterested and quite frustrated to have to deal in Snarks' affairs, quit Power Pack{{r|Power Pack Vol 2 4}} to tend to the team's deeply-ill mother, and Julie Power moved to L.A. to pursue an acting career while attending a super human support group known as [[Loners (Earth-616)|Excelsior]]. She had not registered with the [[Superhuman Registration Act]].<!-- verify all sentences are based on G.L.A. #2--> Katie Power once triumphed over the forces of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics (Earth-616)|A.I.M.]],{{r|G.L.A.

They teamed-up with [[Devil Dinosaur (Earth-78411)|Devil Dinosaur]], [[Gwendolyn Poole (Earth-TRN565)|Gwenpool]], and [[Lunella Lafayette (Earth-616)|Moon Girl]].{{r|Unbelievable Gwenpool Vol 1 25}}\n\nBack at [[New York City]], the Power Pack (still hiding their powers from their parents, despite Katie renewing her intention to reveal the truth to them) reformed as [[Carmody Research (Earth-616)|Carmody Research]] former CEO (and James Power's former boss) [[Douglas Carmody (Earth-616)|Douglas Carmody]], turned into a literal [[Demons|demon]], the Bogeyman, kidnapped (and intending to eat) orphans. Katie urged her siblings to intervene. As the Power Pack located him, he was being cornered and shot at (ineffectively) by the [[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]]. After a brief brawl, the Bogeyman was neutralized by the irrupting [[Child Hero Reconnaissance and Disruption Law Enforcement (Earth-616)|C.R.A.D.L.E.]] agents, intending to arrest Power Pack for violation of [[Kamala's Law]] (punishing unlicensed vigilante justice), as the law had came into full effect that very night at 6 pm.{{r|Power Pack Vol 4 1}}\n\n| Equipment               = * '''[[Power Pack Uniforms]]:''' Each member of Power Pack was given a costume made of [[unstable molecules]]{{r|Power Pack Vol 4 1}} by the [[Smartship Friday]]. [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]] was later given a costume by Friday as well. With the verbal command, \"Costumes On,\" the costume will appear, replacing any existing clothes. The costumes are maintained when not in use by residents of an alternate reality known as [[Elsewhere (Realm)|Elsewhere]]. In addition to summoning, alterations to the costumes can be made by contacting the Elsewhere tailors with notes left in the pockets. Alterations include space worthy costumes and underwater ones as well. Notices also need to be left in the pocket to transform the costumes to indicate the powers possessed by its member. Additional accessories can also be added that become part of the permanent costume until the kids express a desire to alter them again. The pockets of each costume are portals to Elsewhere. Therefore, the kids can hold a significant amount of stuff in the pockets of their costumes without creating a bulge or weight. The limits of the Elsewhere tailors have yet to be expressed.{{citation}}\n\n| Transportation          = [[Smartship Friday|Kymellian Smartship Friday]]\n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = * [[Alexander Power (Earth-616)|Alex Power]] was possibly identified as a potential member of the [[50-State Initiative (Earth-616)|Initiative]] when he appeared alongside numerous Marvel superheroes on the cover of {{cl|Avengers: The Initiative #1}} (June, 2007), though not all of these superheroes have since been seen to participate in the Initiative.\n* This Power Pack, from the [[Earth-616|mainstream universe]], should not be confused with the [[Earth-5631]] [[Power Pack (Earth-5631)|version of Power Pack]], who are the main protagonists in that universe.\n* In {{cl|Power Pack Vol 2 1}} (August, 2000), the Power parents are aware of their children's powers and secret identity (and fear that neighbors would witness those powers and deem the Power children [[Homo superior|mutants]]). This was seemingly retconned in {{cl|Power Pack Vol 4 1}} (November 25, 2020), where the Power Pack hide their powers and superheroic activities from their parents.<!-- was there a reason for that change, like for Daredevil or Spider-Man identity going public and secret back and forth?-->\n* Throughout their history, the kids swapped powers and changed codenames frequently. They couldn't swap powers whenever they wished but only during times of extreme stress and they had little control over who got which power. These powers could only be swapped between these four children because these four children received their powers in the same moment and by the same process. There were situations where only one of these kids possessed all of these powers while the other three were powerless. Most notably was when Alex, under the codename, Powerhouse, had all the powers.{{citation}}\n| Trivia                  = * In 1991, after the cancellation of the [[Power Pack Vol 1|original comics series]], Marvel developed Power Pack into a live-action show for NBC's Saturday children's television lineup. While a pilot episode was made, the series was not picked up. The pilot was never aired, but in the years that followed, copies of the tape circulated among Power Pack fans.{{citation}}\n| Links                   = * [[Wikipedia:Power Pack|Power Pack at Wikipedia.org]]\n}}"
