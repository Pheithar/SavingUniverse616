His hemophilia forced him out of the project. Harmon was a mentor of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Reed Richards]]. He also worked with [[Howard Stark (Earth-616)|Howard Stark]] in designing bio-weapons.{{r|New Warriors #4}} He however later formed his own company called Genetech, the world leader in genetic research.{{r|New Warriors Vol 1 1}}\n\n===Psionex===\nTo that end, he brought together five people of various \"descriptions,\" and enhanced them with Psionic energy calling the team the [[Psionex (Earth-616)|Psionex]]. Psionex played the part of super-powered bodyguards at Genetech. When the Warriors illegally trespassed on the Genetech grounds, Psionex was responsible for capturing them, and containing them for the authorities. They later of broke free of their masters at Genetech, and fought the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]], a team of teen heroes with close ties to the company. \n\nAfter the [[Spidercide (Earth-616)|Spidercide]] stole a supply of ribonucleic nanocontagium, the [[New Warriors (Earth-616)|New Warriors]] were asked to bring it back.{{r|New Warriors Vol 1 #61}}\n\nWhen they heard about the tragedy in [[Pennsylvania (State)|Pennsylvania]], the New Warriors questioned [[Walter Rosen (Earth-616)|Mr. Rosen]] about the relation between the incident and the stolen nanocontagion.{{r|Spider-Man: Maximum Clonage Alpha Vol 1 1}}\n\n===Terrax===\nHarmon foolishly tried to absorb the irradiated remains of [[Tyros (Earth-616)|Terrax]]  in order to stop a battle between the New Warriors and Genetech's test subjects Psionex. Terrax absorbed Harmon and reconfigured his body to better serve as his host. To date there has never been any indication that Harmon's mind survived being absorbed by Terrax.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}\n[[Category:Companies]]"
