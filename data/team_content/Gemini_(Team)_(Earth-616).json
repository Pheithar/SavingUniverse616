It was a force of unknown origin unleashed by the experiments of Edwig Caine, a scientist and ex [[MI5 (Earth-616)|MI5]] agent obsessed with taming the forces which create superheroes.{{r|Europa Vol 1 2}}\n\nThe Meta-Impulse revealed itself to be the key to our dimension for a powerful demonic entity who sealed a bargain with Caine, so five infants were resurrected by the demon Nosferath and imbued with a fraction of his powers.\n\nAfter a period under medical examinations and observation, the children were turned back to their family or adopted. Meanwhile thanks to a government coverup, the Italian terrorist organization \"Alba Nera\" (Black Dawn) was framed as guilty for the explosion.{{r|Europa Vol 1 3}}\n\nWhen years later the legacy of Nosferath has begun to resurface in the form of super powers, the kids were recruited by Caine in his superhuman task force, Gemini. In the base of Vera Croce, in an undisclosed location in northern Italy, their powers were honed and they were trained in combat and in the use of weapons.{{r|Europa Vol 1 1}}\n\nHoping to receive EuroMind's (European branch of the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]) endorsement, Caine arranges a team evaluation sponsored by [[Nicholas Fury (Earth-616)|Nick Fury]]. Eventually, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Lancelot comes out with a negative opinion, components of the team are deemed too ruthless and bloodthirsty.{{r|Europa Vol 1 0}}\n\nLater, the team faced Nosferath in battle and they were nearly killed, only the intervention of the cosmic entity known as the [[Voyager_(Europa)_(Earth-616)|Voyager]] saved them, banishing the demon in his extradimensional prison and thus freeing the five from his curse but leaving their powers intact. Edwig Caine apparently died on this mission.{{r|Europa Vol 1 4}}\n\nAfter this battle the team went into hiding and none of them has been seen anymore.\n\n| Equipment               = \n| Transportation          = \n| Weapons                 = \n\n| Notes                   = \n| Trivia                  = \n| Links                   = \n}}"
