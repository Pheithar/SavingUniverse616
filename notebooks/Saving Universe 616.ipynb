    "# Saving Universe 616\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze a graph made by characters and teams from the [Marvel Earth-616](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Earth-616). Being the central Marvel universe, it has a lot of different characters and teams (30021 other characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "![header](../images/marvel616.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to offer some understanding of the relationships inside this vast universe and try to get meaningful information from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is obtained from the [official marver wiki](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Marvel_Database).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Marvel multiverse is formed by all the marvel comics, animated series and films that uses the Marvel characters. As you can imagine, it is pretty huge multiverse. Thuis, is divided in universes, defined by the word `Earth` followed by a number, that works as a universe ID, for example `Earth-616` is the main marvel universe, where the most famous Marvel events happened, such as Civil War, Infinity Saga or the House of M.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are focusing in this universe, as is the one with the most charcaters and most interesting stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation of the work is to try to analyze and get information from the characters in the Earth-616 that belong to, at least, one team.\n",
    "\n",
    "This limitation is due to how many characters there are, in an attempt to reduce the size of our netwrok. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic stats\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, we worked with just a few characters, because we had to manually select a couple teams, and we only got the characters that belonged to that team. After some more research, we were able to get every single team and orgnaization, but we had to do some more complex queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "We had to specify that the `list` is `categorymember` What this does is it gets all the elements that belong to a category. In this case the category is `Category:Earth-616/Teams` or `Category:Earth-616/Organizations`. This is because we only want the teams that belong to the universe 616, qhich is the main marvel universe. That way we can get all the teams. And luckily, there is another category that is very useful to us, which is `Category:TEAM/Members`, which returns as a list all the members of a single team. That way we can get all teams and all characters that belong to at least a team from the marvel 616 universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is just one small problem. The maximun elements that `categorymember` return is 500, and there are 3054 teams and 19148 elements. To solve this there is the `cmcontinue` parameter, which allows to get the next 500 elements. This eleme nt is returned by the query, so to get every element from the list, we need to do a while loop until the `cmcontinue` value is empty, because it means there are no more values to retrieve with the query.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "From this project, we can first and foremost conclude that the Marvel Universe 616, and presumably the other marvel universes are very interlinked. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can from the network analysis observe that we have prominent characters linking to a lot of teams and a lot of characters. This is presumably because of the long history of the marvel comics and movies. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we have delved into mostly the comic universe, and as that universe contains so much more information than the cinematic, we can observe that the characters that are commonly known to some degree also are the characters most known (connected) in the comics: Wolverine, Spiderman, Magneto, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the sentiment analysis, we observed that although some teams and characters are happier than others, the general happiness score is relatively low. This might be because the Marvel Universe is jam-packed with action. Most of the lore around the characters is about their struggles against supervillains or the descriptions of the supervillains mowing down planets. Although the narratives might be heroic or stoic, we still observed a lot of words that could have a negative connotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another lesson from this project is just how convoluted stories over time become. Initially, we wanted to divide the characters into heroes and villains. Still, as we progressed through the project, it became clear that the definition of good and evil is not as static in the Marvel Universe as one might imagine. The seed for us was reading up on Magneto, where he is first an ally of the X-Men and later an enemy. This, in our eyes, makes the universe a lot more interesting as the characters are no longer clearly black or white but greyer, and their actions and plotlines become more attractive as an effect of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "We display multiple stats and characteristics from the data, but we were unable to reconstruct the original teams, as for that, more complex techniques would have been necessary. We started this proyect with an ambitious idea, without thinking if it was among the competences of this course, or how difficult would it be to achieve. The original idea was to recreate from the links the original teams. What's the problem, right? That shouldn't be so difficult. Well, the main problem is that, from the wiki content, one can get the characters that are referenced in other, but there is nop way, or at least no easy way, to get if the refrences from a character are allies, enemies, partners in a team or just random meetings between characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second problem is the complexity of the marvel timeline. Marvel comics have been around for quite some time (since 1939), and the main universe was created on 1961. Since then, many teams have been created and have disappeared. Many heores have been in multiple teams, and relationship between characters has changed a lot. Because of the size of the universe many different authors insert different ideas of what each character means to them. That results in characters that started in a team, then leave it, then came back and maybe, later, they became enemies to that team. This relationships results in that some characters are enemies and allies of themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can guess, this makes the team reconstruction goal almost impossible. \n",
    "\n",
    "After realising this, wqe thought that maybe we could try to insert some kind of timeline to the characters, to see how the evolution of the characters goes. But again, this is very difficult for many reasons. First, the time in the marvel universe is not constant at all. Peter Parker (Spider-Man) was introduced in 1962, but as today, he is still not over 30 years old. On top of that, some events have time travel and inmortal beings. It is a huge chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, we decided to just analyze and do some kind of informative wiki of the marvel 616 universe, showing different stats for each character and each team, so we could apply different techniques and anlysis from what we learn during the course and show how dfficult and confusing the Marvel universe is.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is missing? Well, that is easy, a reconstruction of the teams based on the links from each character. Is an obtainable goal? Not really, at least not without using much more complex techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "About possible improvements and future works from this proyect could be trying to incorpore more universes to the network. Apatrtrt from the 616, there are some more interesting and big universes from the marvel multiverse, such as *Earth-1610* (Ultimate Marvel Universe), Earth-199999 (Marvel Cinematic Universe) and Earth-928 (2099 year universe).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Althoug both of us have worked on all the proyect, I (Alejandro) have dedicated more time on this notebook, and have done more research on how to do the queries and how to obtain the analysis. Gustav is the one to thank for the multithreading of the download of the content, that allow us to get all the information in appropiate time (It went from around 10 hourst to download to 3 minutes, quite impressive to say the least :) ). He is the responsible of the cool website too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of us agreed on the idea on what to do, thorugh multiple sesions of brainstorming. Unfortunatly, we got stuck with the proyect multiple times, because we didn't know what to get from the data, as we could not do what we thought we could at first. But, after finishing the full proyect, we are happy with the results, and how everything turn out at the end, as it feel informative, and we have learnt quite a lot."
