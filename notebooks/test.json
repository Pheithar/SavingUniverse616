As Kasady mockingly says that the guards are feeding Eddie to him like a mouse to a snake, the guards snap at him to shut up and play nice. As the guards leave, Eddie gruffly tells Kasady he wants the bottom bunk so that he can keep an eye on him, Kasady agreeing and quipping that Eddie is smarter than his last cellmate, who's death earned him his eleventh life sentence. Kasady asks for Eddie\u2019s name, and upon recognizing him as the monstrous supervillain Venom, he gleefully states that they\u2019re alike and asks if they could team up.  Eddie immediately rebukes him, snapping that they\u2019re nothing alike and that he\u2019s not an insane serial killer who slaughters innocents. Pulling out his headphones, Kasady grouses that Eddie shouldn\u2019t be so rude and reiterates his offer of friendship, grinning wickedly as he says he senses they have a beautiful future ahead of them.\n\nIn the present, Eddie \u2013 bonded to [[Venom III (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a gestalt symbiote formed from amalgamated codices]] \u2013 smashes Kasady \u2013 bonded to [[Carnage IV (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|an offshoot]] of the primordial [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel symbiote]] and now going by Dark Carnage \u2013 through the wall of an abandoned apartment building. Unfazed, Dark Carnage laughs and says that [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] is almost awake, asking Eddie if he can hear him breathing. Punching Dark Carnage in the face, Eddie snarls at him to shut up and die, but mentally notes that Dark Carnage is right and that after bonding to the codices he can feel the [[Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)|symbiote hive mind]]. Grabbing Eddie by the throat, Dark Carnage snarls that he can hear Eddie too, tossing him through the wall and onto the roof of the building across the street. Hovering over Eddie, Dark Carnage says he can see through the eyes of every member of his horde and sees Eddie\u2019s allies being overwhelmed by Carnage doppelg\u00e4ngers. Landing, Dark Carnage says that he\u2019s going to kill Eddie and take his codices, thereby unleashing Knull and bringing ruination to the universe. Gloating, Dark Carnage tells Eddie to give up his codex willingly so that they can rule together; but Eddie snaps at Dark Carnage to shut up, saying that he doesn\u2019t care about Knull or Kasady\u2019s mission to wipe out all life on [[Earth]], he just wants [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|his symbiote]] back and Kasady back in his grave for good.\n\nAs Eddie tells Dark Carnage to take another look at his friends, [[Tyrone Johnson (Earth-616)|Cloak]] teleports into [[Rex Strickland's Warehouse]] and uses [[Cloak's Cloak|his cloak]] to bring [[Tandy Bowen (Earth-616)|Dagger]], [[Daniel Rand (Earth-616)|Iron Fist]], [[Angelica Jones (Earth-616)|Firestar]], [[Michael Morbius (Earth-616)|Morbius]], [[Henry Hayes (Earth-616)|Deathlok]], [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]], [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]], and [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Scream]] in as backup. As the tables turn on his horde, Dark Carnage staggers and clutches his head in disbelief, Eddie taking advantage of the distraction to tackle him off the roof.\n\nIn the tunnels under Rex Strickland's Warehouse, [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] knocks out the Carnageized [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]], turning to reassure [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan Brock]] and [[Norman Harold Osborn (Earth-616)|Normie Osborn]] that everything is going to be fine, before passing out. Normie asks if Spider-Man is dead, but Dylan says he\u2019s just asleep. As he says everything is going to be okay, the offshoot of the Dark Carnage symbiote bonded to Norman detaches from him \u2013 Dark Carnage mockingly telling Eddie that he\u2019s going to use it to kill Dylan. As Norman's offshoot of the Dark Carnage symbiote looms over them, Dylan snaps that he hates symbiotes, his eyes turning black with red spirals. As Dylan thrusts his hands out, Norman's symbiote is obliterated into a spattered puddle of red and black ooze, Normie incredulously asking Dylan how he did that. Stammering that he doesn\u2019t know, Dylan passes out into Normie\u2019s arms just as Dark Carnage and Eddie crash through the ceiling.\n\nCrawling towards the two boys, Dark Carnage laughs and says that Dylan is the final piece of the puzzle, Eddie grabbing onto his ankle and \u2013 retracting the symbiote from his face \u2013 shouting that he won\u2019t let Carnage kill his son as he tries to restrain his nemesis with tendrils. Laughing sinisterly, Dark Carnage says that Eddie still doesn\u2019t understand that he\u2019s already lost \u2013 explaining that between the two of them they have more than enough codices to awaken Knull. Retracting the Dark Carnage symbiote from his skull-like face, Kasady states that Eddie faces the choice of allowing him to consume Dylan\u2019s codex or killing him to save Dylan and take back his symbiote \u2013 but either way Knull will be unleashed. Eddie realizes that Kasady planned for him to take the codices from the [[Symbiote Codex Isolation and Thermo-Heated Extraction|S.C.I.T.H.E.]] and place him in a lose-lose scenario, deciding to save his son anyway. Manifesting a necrosword from his symbiote and impaling Dark Carnage with it, Eddie slices him in half; the Dark Carnage and Venom symbiotes leaving Kasady \u2013 whose corpse shatters as it falls to the ground - and bonding to Brock. As it rebonds to him and assimilates the Dark Carnage symbiote and the gestalt codices, the Venom symbiote berates Eddie and informs him that Knull has awakened.\n\nLight years away, the planet [[Klyntar (Location)|Klyntar]] explodes into billions of symbiotes, Knull coalescing them into a fleet of [[Symbiote Dragons|Symbiote-Dragons]], manifesting [[Knull's Symbiote (Earth-616)|a suit of draconic symbiote-armor]], and resuming his conquest of the cosmos.\n\nOpening his eyes to the Venom symbiote, asking if he can hear it and begging him to talk to it, Eddie turns to see Spider-Man regaining consciousness. Spider-Man asks if they won, Eddie hesitantly saying that they did. Looking around, Spider-Man wonders where Norman Osborn disappeared to, Eddie saying that he didn't notice and that he should get on it. Sighing, Spider-Man says he'll do so after checking in on how everyone else is doing, asking Eddie if they're good. Hugging him, Eddie says that they're good, Spider-Man awkwardly saying he's unsure what their relationship is now, but that he has Eddie's back. Taking Normie, Spider-Man leaves and tells Eddie to look after Dylan. Saying he'll do his best, Eddie turns to see Dylan staring at him in shock and sits next to him. After several seconds of staring blankly ahead, Dylan asks if Eddie said that he was his son.\n\n| Solicit             = VENOM AND CARNAGE \u2013 TO THE DEATH!\n\n| Notes               = \n===Continuity Notes===\n* In {{cl|Absolute Carnage vs. Deadpool Vol 1 3}}, Deadpool's legs were blown off and take time to regenerate; however, here he's shown with his legs already fully restored.\n| Trivia              = \n| Recommended         = \n| Links               = \n}}\n[[ru:Absolute Carnage Vol 1 5]]\n[[Category:Digital Comic Code included]]"}}}]}, "1163143": {"pageid": 1163143, "ns": 0, "title": "Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 4 1", "revisions": [{"slots": {"main": {"contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki", "*": "{{Marvel Database:Comic Template\n| Image1              = Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 4 1.jpg\n| Image2              = Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 4 1 Textless.jpg\n| Image2_Text         = Textless\n| Image4              = Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 4 1 Dell'Otto Variant Textless.jpg\n| Image4_Text         = Dell'Otto Variant Textless\n| Image5              = Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 4 1 Marvel's Spider-Man Video Game Variant.jpg\n| Image5_Text         = Marvel's Spider-Man Video Game Variant\n| Image6              = Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 4 1 Marvel's Spider-Man Video Game Variant Textless.jpg\n| Image6_Text         = Marvel's Spider-Man Video Game Variant Textless\n| Image7              = Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 4 1 Second Printing Variant.jpg\n| Image7_Text         = Second Printing Variant Textless\n| Month               = 11\n| Year                = 2018\n| ReleaseDate         = 9-19-2018\n| Pages               = 40\n| Rating              = T\n| OriginalPrice       = $4.99\n| PreviousIssue       = {{cl|Amazing Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 42}}<br>(Title)\n\n| Editor-in-Chief     = C.B.

Imprisoned and hungry for battle, it was unwittingly freed by [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]] and bonded to him, eventually returning with its \"friend\" to Earth. The symbiote happily notes that it's never had someone so kind as a host before and wants to permanently bond with him.\n\nSpider-Man meets with [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]] and gushes about how awesome his new alien costume is, but she remarks that its autonomous nature sounds creepy and advises he remove it until he can get [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mister Fantastic]] to examine it, flirtatiously offering to help. They arrive at an old warehouse where [[Hammerhead (Joseph) (Earth-616)|Hammerhead]] and [[Maggia (Earth-616)|his gang]] are stashing high-power weaponry, crashing though the skylight. The symbiote notes that its host is brave and strong, but his mind is troubled with insignificant worries: Peter gets into an argument with [[Joseph Robertson (Earth-616)|Joe Robertson]], having been out of touch while dealing with \"personal business,\" and is put on-notice. Visiting his [[Maybelle Parker (Earth-616)|Aunt May]], Peter brushes aside her concerns that something is wrong, causing her to scold him for lying to her; and Black Cat threatens to break up with him for being two hours late for their patrol, though Spider-Man apologizes and tells her he feels his life is spiraling out of control.\n\nNoticing that even while he sleeps its host fears every minor decision will result in disaster, the symbiote eagerly decides to help by bonding to Peter while he sleeps and setting off into the night to fight crime. Noting that its host desires to protect those weaker than himself, the symbiote resolves to do the same; finding a woman in the midst of being mugged. The would-be purse-snatcher pulls a gun, but the symbiote webs his hand and proceeds to pummel him to death, the woman passing out in horror at the grotesque display of violence. Satisfied by a job well-done, the symbiote departs thinking to itself that its host would be pleased by what it's done. Peter awakens the following afternoon feeling exhausted despite sleeping most of the day away. Hearing a knock at his apartment door, he opens it to see [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]], who expresses concern at his disheveled appearance and invites him out for dinner. MJ asks Peter if he hasn't been sleeping, but Peter responds that he has; causing her to tell him to go see a doctor. As he heads home, the symbiote notes that he's consumed by thoughts regarding his old life and his old costume. Annoyed and determined to prove itself superior to his red-and-blues, the symbiote covers him again to do the work he would have wanted. Arriving at a jewelry store burglary, the symbiote viciously attacks the robbers, feeding Spider-Man dreams of saving his [[Benjamin Parker (Earth-616)|Uncle Ben]] and rescuing [[Gwendolyne Stacy (Earth-616)|Gwen Stacy]] so that he won't wake up and be alarmed. Leaving the thugs' broken bodies behind it, the symbiote returns Peter to his bed, never to see the work it does using his body but believing he would be proud if he could.\n\nPeter awakens from a nightmare influenced by the symbiote's nightly beat-downs, spotting Black Cat sitting in his window. Sitting on his bed, she asks what's bothering him and he tells her that he's suffering from a bizarre combination of nightmares, insomnia, narcolepsy, and uncharacteristic bloodlust. Black Cat, unnerved, suggests he see a doctor, but Peter says he hasn't had the time to do so or even take his costume to Reed for analysis because of how much time he's been spending asleep.\n\nThe symbiote takes over Peter again, noting there's more violence than usual. Coming across a shoot-out between Hammerhead's gang and a rival street-gang, the symbiote engages with its usual show of excess force. A young man caught up in the shootout emerges from his hiding place, noting that the symbiote resembles Spider-Man but that Spider-Man doesn't kill people. As he scolds it for killing the thugs, saying they had families and that he's classmates with some of their kids; the symbiote silently regards him, not fully understanding his words but impressed by his strength of will. Wondering if they stopped teaching new superheroes that killing is wrong, the young man thanks the symbiote for saving his life but notes that he could still be in danger if Hammerhead or the rival gang think he's responsible. Picking the young man up, the symbiote web-swings through the streets. Coming across a burning apartment, the young man spots an old man trapped in one of the upper floors and urges the symbiote to save him. Despite being afraid of the fire, the symbiote notes that its host wouldn't let fear stop him. Determined to follow his example - as to do any less would be akin to rejecting him - it creates a web-net to catch the old man, who is retrieved by firefighters. As the symbiote drops the young man off in an alley, he tells it that it's going to do alright as a hero. As he watches it depart, however, he is immediately approached by Hammerhead himself.\n\nThe next evening, desiring for reasons it doesn't understand to visit its new friend, the symbiote bonds to Peter as he sleeps despite his exhaustion. Having a sudden vision of him being killed by Hammerhead's crew, the symbiote arrives at the warehouse and immediately attacks the thugs present. Hammerhead himself arrives holding a high-tech flamethrower he calls the Slagger, while one of his thugs holds the symbiote's young friend hostage. The young man bites his captor's arm, but Hammerhead disregards him and blasts the symbiote with a torrent of blue flames. Incapacitated by the pain, the symbiote is helpless as Hammerhead prepares to fire a second blast... only for its friend to unplug the gun from its fuel tank. As Hammerhead turns to confront him, the symbiote gets up and the two of them get into a brawl. Unnerved by the symbiote's silence - save for angry hissing - Hammerhead is overwhelmed by its superior strength. Hammerhead surrenders and orders his men to stand down, but the symbiote prepares to kill him anyway - only stopping because its friend asks it to. As the symbiote and its friend leave, Hammerhead's men question whether they were even fighting Spider-Man. Groggily getting to his feet, Hammerhead tells them not to breathe a word about this to anyone.\n\nElsewhere, the young man thanks the symbiote for saving him but notes that it was the one who endangered him in the first place. Adding that it all evens out since they saved each other, the young man states that the symbiote could be a good hero if it chilled out and eased up on the gratuitous violence. Returning home, the symbiote has the epiphany that its nighttime excursions have been harmful to its host and decides to discontinue them so that he can rest and recover. The very next day, however, Spider-Man takes his black suit to the Fantastic Four; learning that it is a possibly-parasitic alien lifeform. As Spider-Man tries to remove it, the symbiote is horrified by this betrayal and desperately refuses to separate from him; stating that he needs it and it needs him. Reed pulls out a sonic blaster and blasts the symbiote, the pain forcing it off Spider-Man. Brooding on why its beloved host rejected it, the symbiote bitterly notes it's been hurt and imprisoned again by its only friend, who rejected and hates it when it only wanted to help him. Angry and vengeful, the symbiote manifests a fanged maw as it states that while Spider-Man may think he's done with it, it's not done with him.\n\n| Solicit             = TIES THAT BIND!\n\nYears ago, Spider-Man came back from an alien world with a fantastic new costume \u2014 one he eventually learned was a living alien symbiote looking to bond with him permanently!

He pauses to rest on a tree, lamenting that all he wants is a nap, and narrowly evades a flurry of darts, asking if his opponent can cut him some slack. \n\nSnapping that he will show neither slack or mercy, Kraven the Hunter tackles Deadpool to the ground, having mistaken him for Spider-Man and being intent on ending their long enmity. As Kraven prepares to stab him, Deadpool protests that he's got the wrong person and lashes out with a symbiotic tendril, accidentally flipping up the front of Kraven's loincloth. While Deadpool is both disgusted and impressed by Kraven going commando, Kraven recovers and states that Spider-Man's new tricks won't save him. As he launches into a tirade about how he is the Predator's Spirit, Deadpool kicks him in the face and web-swings away. Kraven retaliates with a volley of poisoned darts, which Deadpool attempts to evade only to notice that several hit his back. Crashing into a tree, Deadpool falls to the ground in a delirious state while the symbiote expels the darts, and struggles to get away so that his healing factor can get rid of the toxins. Kraven arrives and finds the discarded darts, sniffing one of them before proclaiming that Spider-Man won't be able to hide for long since he mixed the toxins specifically to bring him down. \n\nBehind Kraven, Deadpool - disguised as a tree using the symbiote's shapeshifting - quips that this is where Kraven's mistaken identity is going to cost him. Sporting a fanged mouth and claws, Deadpool grabs Kraven from behind; the hunter gleefully remarking that Spider-Man has finally given into his rage and predatory side, and that the true hunt can begin. He's interrupted by Deadpool asking if he dyes his hair, and angrily kicks him away, snapping that he won't let his opponent's sarcasm ruin the sacred rite of the hunt. Deadpool begins to come up with a retort before the venom from the darts kicks in, enabling Kraven to attack him. Tossing Kraven aside with tentacles, Deadpool flees in search of a spot to rest, reliving his and the symbiote's memories as a psychedelic nightmare, and sensing the alien's profound loneliness, abandonment, and rage at being abandoned by the one hero it wanted to befriend. Dropping to the ground, Deadpool curls up to sleep the toxins off, not realizing he's landed in a lion enclosure.\n\nAs one of the lions curiously sniffs him, Deadpool swats its snout away and grumbles for Aunt May to let him sleep. Suddenly waking up wondering who Aunt May is, Deadpool notices the angry lion, which slashes him across the face. Deadpool prepares to return the favor, but a strange ululating howl interrupts him. Kraven tackles the lion, snapping that no caged beast will take his prey from him. When Deadpool mocks his entrance and calls him a redneck, Kraven kicks him in the face and snaps that it was a Kravinoff virility cry. When he calls Deadpool Spider-Man again, Wade retracts the symbiote to reveal his scarred face, revealing that Kraven has got the wrong person. When Kraven is left speechless by his mistake, Deadpool assures him it was an easy mistake to make; but when he calls Spider-Man awesome the symbiote abruptly seizes control and snarls that Spider-Man is not awesome, but a monster for bringing it to this strange world and abandoning it. As Kraven and the lions watch in stunned silence, Deadpool and the symbiote alternate control as they argue, with Deadpool suggesting the symbiote cut Spider-Man some slack since he's got a lot to worry about, the symbiote angrily cutting him off and snarling that it and Deadpool are one and hate Spider-Man together. Deadpool retorts that the symbiote was trying to control Spider-Man and that at this moment he can see why Spider-Man wouldn't like that. The symbiote is enraged by this insult, shouting that it helped Spider-Man and saved his life, but he left it to die and be hunted. Deadpool tries to calm it down, saying that the symbiote has got him now, that it doesn't need Spider-Man anymore, and can let go of its anger. \n\nKraven interrupts, saying that Deadpool has made his point and that he can see that he's not Spider-Man. Livid, the symbiote takes over Deadpool and transforms into a bulky, monstrous form. Slamming Kraven to the ground, it snarls that it can tell that the drugs he's been using have left him terminally ill and that if he really wants to kill Spider-Man he should ditch the knives and darts and [[Kraven's Last Hunt|just use a gun]]. As the monstrous Deadpool leaves, Kraven stands up, awed into believing the symbiote to be a dark spirit imitating Spider-Man's form to tell him what must be done, and vows to hunt Spider-Man one last time.\n\nThe next day, Deadpool awakens on a rooftop, covered in pigeons and guano. He assumes his argument with the symbiote was nothing more than a nightmare induced by the poisoned darts, and remarks that he hopes he's seen the last of Kraven and his [[venom]]. Elsewhere, Killer Thrill vows to avenge Coldwar, saying that only she should be allowed to kill her teammates. She asks Guzz if he's found a way to lure the symbiote to them, and Guzz replies that because the symbiote has a connection to its past hosts, the easiest way to draw it out would be capturing and torturing Spider-Man.\n\n| Appearing1          = \n'''Featured Characters:'''\n* {{a|[[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool (Wade Wilson)]]}} \n'''Supporting Characters:'''\n* {{a|[[Venom (Symbiote)

the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]]'s encounter with the [[Symbiote Dragons|symbiote dragon]] called [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]] and the [[Elder Gods|elder god]] of darkness, [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] - who predated the creation of the universe and had created the [[Symbiotes (Race)|symbiotes]] from the living abyss of his primordial kingdom. Telling them that Knull had been betrayed and imprisoned by his creations billions of years ago, Eddie confesses that Knull is now free and that it's all his fault: [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Dark Carnage]] - who had sought to free Knull from [[Klyntar (Location)|his interstellar prison]] - had forced him to choose between saving the Earth at the cost of [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|his son]]'s life or saving his son at the cost of freeing Knull, and Eddie had picked the latter. As Eddie concludes by saying that Knull is coming to destroy all existence and that he doesn't know how to stop him, the Avengers uniformly react with dismay and outrage. [[Jennifer Walters (Earth-616)|Hulk]] complains that things were already bad enough with [[Bruce Banner (Earth-616)|her cousin]] being involved with [[One Below All (Multiverse)|an all-destroying eldritch god]] of his own; and [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Iron Man]] launches into a furious tirade berating Eddie for not coming to them the moment he encountered the avatar of an entity capable of one-shotting [[Celestials]]. When [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] interrupts to say they need to use what little time they have left to prepare instead of pointing fingers, Iron Man snaps that they don't know how much time they have left until Knull arrives; sneering at Eddie saying the Venom symbiote would sense Knull's presence were he close enough to pose an immediate threat. Captain America tells Eddie to go home and get some rest so they can plan things out, assuring him that everything will work out; but once Eddie leaves he admits to the still-angry Tony that despite his earlier calm bravado he's just as uncertain and terrified as the rest of the team.\n\nIn [[Manhattan]], Eddie dejectedly walks down the street using the Venom symbiote as an umbrella; berating himself for even thinking that he deserved to be in the same room as the Avengers - let alone a member of the team - and that he deserves to be locked up for dooming not just the Earth but all life in the universe. The Venom symbiote attempts to interrupt Eddie's self-loathing inner monologue, but Eddie ignores it; remarking that Iron Man looked ready to kill him and probably should have. Manifesting a head, the Venom symbiote speaks directly to Eddie, urgently telling him that there's an enemy behind him. Before Eddie can react he's blasted in the back by a beam of energy, the Venom symbiote informing him that three of his ribs are broken. As the symbiote heals him, Eddie looks up to see [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|a figure]] clad in Stark-tech armor and mistakes him for Iron Man. As the symbiote sprouts arachnoid legs and roars, the armored figure responds that he's not Iron Man before introducing himself as Virus and declaring his intent to kill Venom for ruining his life. Virus - clad in a [[Virus Armor|jury-rigged suit]] of [[War Machine Armor]] painted black-and-gold to resemble Venom - uses sonic emitters to separate the Venom symbiote from Eddie before flying fists-first into Eddie's chest, completely destroying his ribcage and shredding his lungs. The Venom symbiote quickly rebonds to Eddie and begins repairing the damage, angrily rebuking Eddie's attempts to tell it that they have to run. As Virus snaps that Venom took everything from him, the Venom symbiote takes over Eddie and snares Virus in a thick mass of tendrils. Retorting that it doesn't care who Virus is, the Venom symbiote snarls that he should consider it letting him live as an apology for whatever it was that it and Eddie took from him. Declaring that they have more important things to worry about, Venom bites through the power cable supplying energy to Virus' shoulder-mounted energy cannon and tosses him aside contemptuously, the symbiote telling him to leave before it changes its mind. Virus blasts Venom with the sonic emitter, revealing he knows about Dylan, and then drops a gas grenade pumpkin bomb to create a smokescreen. \n\nWatching Virus escape on a [[Goblin Glider]], the Venom symbiote questions if he might be [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]], but Eddie states that the Green Goblin wouldn't go to such lengths to conceal his identity. As Venom picks up the pumpkin bomb - which has been repainted to look like Virus' helmet - the symbiote irritably wonders who Virus could be, noting that his armor had been specced specifically to kill symbiotes. Looking down at the pumpkin bomb in his hand, Eddie uncertainly replies that he has no idea.\n\n| Solicit             = Marvel's Silver-level FCBD title provides two exciting tales connected to the coming major storylines in Venom, Amazing Spider-Man and Black Cat from top creators Donny Cates, Ryan Stegman, Jed MacKay, Patrick Gleason and more!\n\n| Notes               = * Following the cancellation of [[Free Comic Book Day|Free Comic Book Day 2020]], which would have fallen on May 2, due to the [[wikipedia:COVID-19 pandemic|COVID-19 pandemic]], this issue and {{cl|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2020 (X-Men/Dark Ages)}} were re-solicited for July as part of Marvel Comics' publishing program \"Back in Action.\"{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/marvel-comic-book-retailers-to-provide-free-x-men-and-spider-man-venom-comic-books-in-comic-shops-this-july|title=Marvel & Comic Book Retailers to Provide Free X-Men and Spider-Man/Venom Comic Books in Comic Shops This July|work=Marvel|date=8 June 2020|accessdate=8 June 2020}}}}\n* Eddie Brock says that Knull was betrayed by the symbiotes and imprisoned in [[Klyntar (Location)|Klyntar]] billions of years ago, but {{cl|Venom Vol 4 4}} establishes that this happened in the 6th century.\n| Trivia              = \n| Recommended         = \n| Links               = \n}}"}}}]}, "1493645": {"pageid": 1493645, "ns": 0, "title": "King in Black Vol 1 5", "revisions": [{"slots": {"main": {"contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki", "*": "{{Marvel Database:Comic Template\n| Image1              = King in Black Vol 1 5.jpg\n| Image2              = \n| Image2_Text         = Textless\n| Image3              = King in Black Vol 1 5 Lee Exclusive Variant.jpg\n| Image3_Text         = Black Flag Comics / KRS Comics Exclusive Variant\n| Image4              = King in Black Vol 1 5 Lee Exclusive Virgin Variant.jpg\n| Image4_Text         = Black Flag Comics / KRS Comics Exclusive Virgin Variant\n| Image5              = King in Black Vol 1 5 Booth Variant.jpg\n| Image5_Text         = Booth Variant\n| Image6              = King in Black Vol 1 5 Booth Wraparound Variant.jpg\n| Image6_Text         = Booth Wraparound Variant\n| Image7              = King in Black Vol 1 5 Dragon Variant.jpg\n| Image7_Text         = Dragon Variant\n| Image8              = King in Black Vol 1 5 Sketch Variant.jpg\n| Image8_Text         = Sketch Variant\n| Image9              = King in Black Vol 1 5 Spoiler Variant.jpg\n| Image9_Text         = Spoiler Variant\n| Image10             = King in Black Vol 1 5 Spoiler Variant Textless.jpg \n| Image10_Text        = Spoiler Variant Textless\n| Image11             = King in Black Vol 1 5 Tattoo Variant.jpg\n| Image11_Text        = Tattoo Variant\n| Image12             = King in Black Vol 1 5 Unknown Comic Books Exclusive Variant.jpg\n| Image12_Text        = Unknown Comic Books Exclusive Variant\n| Image13             = King in Black Vol 1 5 Unknown Comic Books Exclusive Color Splash Variant.jpg\n| Image13_Text        = Unknown Comic Books Exclusive Color Splash Variant\n| Image14             = King in Black Vol 1 5 Unknown Comic Books Exclusive Virgin Variant.jpg\n| Image14_Text        = Unknown Comic Books Exclusive Virgin Variant\n| Image15             = King in Black Vol 1 5 Young Variant.jpg\n| Image15_Text        = Young Variant\n| Image16             = King in Black Vol 1 5 Yu Connecting Variant.jpg\n| Image16_Text        = Yu Connecting Variant\n\n| Month               = 5\n| Year                = 2021\n| ReleaseDate         = 4-7-2021\n| Event1              = King in Black (Event)\n| Pages               = 40\n| Rating              = T+\n| OriginalPrice       = $5.99\n| NextIssue           = {{cl|Venom Vol 4 35}}<br>(Story)\n\n| Editor-in-Chief     = C.B.

<br/>-->\n\n| Synopsis1           = \n===Brief Synopsis===\nThe [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] takes a stand against [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], transforming his [[Silver Surfer's Surfboard|board]] into a sword to fight the god of the symbiotes. The other super heroes at the scene charge against Knull, but they are interrupted when [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]] blasts into the battleground, arriving bonded to the [[Glossary:Enigma Force|Enigma Force]], taking an appearance similar to Venom. Knull's taunts are interrupted when Eddie calls both [[Mjolnir]] and the Surfer's sword-shaped board to him, and merges them into a battle axe. He lunges at Knull, and the villain gives chase. He sends his dragons after Venom, but he easily massacres them. When Knull tries to strike with his [[Glossary:Necrosword|Necrosword]], Eddie blocks the attack and disintegrates the weapon. Venom corners Knull and the villain summons one of his symbiote-infected [[Celestials]], but Brock beheads it. Taking Knull to the top of the [[Empire State Building]], Brock mirrors the villain's attempt on his life. He uses his battle axe to strip Knull's symbiote armor off the villain, and lets go of him.\n\nKnull survives the fall, but warns Eddie that he can't win since his darkness lives on in his son [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan]]. Dropping his axe, Eddie takes off with Knull and plunges with him into the [[Sun (Star)|Sun]], where he atomizes the villain with the Uni-Power. On [[Earth]], the [[Vampires|vampires]] that had assisted [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]] turn on him, but are quickly disintegrated when the symbiotic dome surrounding the Earth breaks apart and sunlight comes through. [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]] and the Silver Surfer call to each of their weapons, and they unmerge from Venom's battle axe. Eddie returns to [[Manhattan]] and approaches Dylan, who is agonizing due to the piece of Knull inside his body. Using the Uni-Power, Eddie rips it Knull's corruption off his son and destroys it. The Enigma Force leaves Eddie, declaring that its protection is no longer needed. The [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]] returns to Eddie and they become Venom again. They grow wings and take flight, with the symbiotes harmlessly orbiting around them. Venom reveals to Eddie that he has become the new god of the symbiotes by freeing their kind from Knull, meaning he is the new King in Black.\n\n===Detailed Synopsis===\nThe [[Norrin Radd (Earth-616)|Silver Surfer]] and [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] face off, Knull recalling [[Silver Surfer: Black Vol 1|their earlier encounter]]. Preparing to resume their duel, the Surfer - restored to his chrome self by the [[Glossary:Enigma Force|God of Light]] - transforms [[Silver Surfer's Surfboard|his board]] into a greatsword and scoffs that he remains unimpressed with Knull, remarking that the God of Light has arisen and chosen a new host. Transforming his [[Knull's Symbiote (Earth-616)|symbiote-armor]] into a more combat-oriented appearance, Knull sneers that the Silver Surfer should remember that no-matter how far light travels there will always be darkness waiting for it. Manifesting his [[Glossary:Necrosword|Necrosword]], Knull remarks that in a way he admires the Silver Surfer and will give him a noble death, remembering him as a worthy opponent. Smirking, the Silver Surfer remarks that he isn't facing Knull alone as members of the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]], [[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]], and [[Fantastic Four (Earth-616)|Fantastic Four]] charge towards them.\n\nBefore the battle can be joined, [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]] - transformed into a [[Captain Universe (Earth-616)|Captain Universe]] form resembling [[Venom]] with glowing eyes and spider-emblems, and constellation-like patterns - lands between Knull and the assembled heroes, saying he'll take it from here. As Spider-Man is shocked to see Eddie alive, Knull grins and mockingly sneers that he's not impressed that his ancient nemesis chose a host he's already killed several times. As Knull scoffs that Eddie can't possibly believe he can beat him, Eddie thinks to himself that Knull is arrogant and thinks his victory is assured, but that while Knull may have fought Venom he's never fought Eddie Brock - the man of a thousand second chances, the comeback king - before. Reaching out his hands, Eddie yanks [[Mjolnir]] and the Silver Surfer's Surfboard to him, to [[Thor Odinson (Earth-616)|Thor]]'s incredulity. Saying that he thinks he ''can'' beat Knull, Eddie merges Mjolnir and the Silver Surfer's board into a battle-axe resembling Venom's spider-emblem. Eddie lunges at Knull, who evades and flies away with a snarl of rage. As Eddie flies after Knull, [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] incredulously asks [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]] and [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Captain Marvel]] if he was hallucinating, only to be told to get his head in the game as a horde of symbiote-controlled civilians stampedes towards them.\n\nConfronted by a horde of [[Symbiote Dragons|symbiote-dragons]], Eddie thinks to himself that Knull is afraid, hiding and throwing everything he can to buy time to escape. As the symbiote-dragons try to devour him, Eddie shreds them with his axe and notes he's having fun. As Eddie shouts for Knull to stop hiding and end this, Knull brandishes his Necrosword and snarls that if Eddie wants to die so badly then [[All-Black (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|All-Black]] will oblige. Eddie nonchalantly catches Knull's Necrosword and destroys it, grabbing the incredulous dark god by the throat and slamming him through the wall of a building. As Eddie prepares to behead him, Knull snarls that he knows nothing of true darkness and activates the symbiote-controlled Celestial - Thor reacting in horror and trying to rally the other heroes to stop it. Dodging the Celestial's energy blast, Eddie lops its head off with a single stroke of his axe and slams into the fleeing Knull - plunging past Spider-Man, who smiles despite grumbling that he still hates symbiotes. Atop the [[Empire State Building]], Eddie snarls that he remembers the pain and fear he felt when Knull dragged him up from the sewers and ripped the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]] from him, returning the favor by ripping Knull's symbiote-armor from him and then contemptuously dropping him. Discarding his axe, Eddie flies down to the ground; Knull picking himself up and snarling that even if Eddie kills him he won't win - the darkness lives in Eddie's son Dylan. Grabbing Knull, Eddie flies into the air and punches through the symbiote-barrier surrounding the Earth. Knull snarls that [[Oblivion (Earth-616)|the Void]] is eternal and that the Abyss has teeth, Eddie retorting that he does as well before blasting Knull with a point-blank blast of divine light from his jaws. Acknowledging that Knull may be right that the darkness is eternal and that some day the Void will consume all existence, Eddie plunges into the heart of the Sun and says he doesn't care. Gripping Knull by the throat, Eddie says that this is for Dylan before vaporizing Knull's body with the Uni-Power. \n\nEmerging from the sun and retracting his mask, Eddie hears the voice of the God of Light asking if he can feel anything. Eddie mentally replies he can hear voices calling to him but can't understand them. As Eddie flies towards Earth, the God of Light tells him the voices belong to the Symbiote Hive celebrating their freedom.\n\nIn New York, a group of [[Vampires|vampires]] celebrate their victory before turning on [[Eric Brooks (Earth-616)|Blade]]. As he's overpowered and pinned to the ground, Blade refuses backup and grins, the vampires demanding to know what he knows that they don't. As the symbiote-dome disperses and the vampires are incinerated by the restored sunlight, Blade replies tht he knows what time it is. Thor and the Silver Surfer separate Eddie's axe back into Mjolnir and the Board, remarking that while the battle is over things are unlikely to ever return to normal. Eddie lands among the assembled heroes, Spider-Man asking if Knull is really dead. Eddie replies that more-or-less that's the case, but as Spider-Man relievedly remarks that it's finally over Eddie spots Dylan and says that it isn't yet. Dylan - his eyes black with red spirals - cries out in pain. As Eddie approaches and asks what's wrong, Dylan hugs him and says that Knull is inside him, trying to take him over. His hand glowing with divine light, Eddie plunges it into Dylan's chest and rips out the symbiote essence inside him before destroying it. \n\nThe Uni-Power leaves Eddie, telling him that he no longer needs its power or protection, and that he has become something more than human. The Venom symbiote rebonds to Eddie, asking if he can feel what's happened. Assuring Dylan and Spider-Man that he's fine and will be right back, Eddie tells the Venom symbiote that he can hear the voices of the Hive but can't understand them. Forming draconic wings, Venom flies into the air, followed by the various now-hostless symbiotes and symbiote-dragons. Spider-Man asks why they're chasing Venom, but Dylan remarks that he's not sure that's what's happening. Telling Eddie that the symbiotes are speaking in their ancient language, the Venom symbiote translates that with Knull vanquished Eddie is now the nexus of the Hive-Mind, the God of the Symbiotes, and the King in Black.\n\n| Solicit             = WHAT\u2019S A GOD TO A NONBELIEVER?\n\n| Notes               = \n===Continuity Notes===\n* Although the [[Krakoa (Earth-616)|Krakoan]] super-heroes are referred to as the \"[[X-Men (Earth-616)|X-Men]]\", the group at that time comprised only [[Scott Summers (Earth-616)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey (Earth-616)|Marvel Girl]].{{r|X-Men Vol 5 15|16}}\n| Trivia              = * [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]] decapitating the Knullified [[Celestials|Celestial]]'s head is a nod to when [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]] did the same with [[Headless Celestial (Earth-616)|another celestial]] in {{cl|Venom Vol 4 4}}.\n| Recommended         = \n| Links               = \n}}\n[[es:King in Black Vol 1 5]]\n[[Category:Digital Comic Code included]]"}}}]}, "848456": {"pageid": 848456, "ns": 0, "title": "Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 3", "revisions": [{"slots": {"main": {"contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki", "*": "{{Marvel Database:Comic Template\n| Image1              = Venom Space Knight Vol 1 3.jpg\n| Image2              = Venom Space Knight Vol 1 3 Textless.jpg\n| Image2_Text         = Textless\n| Image3              = Venom Space Knight Vol 1 3 Panosian Variant.jpg\n| Image3_Text         = Panosian Variant\n| Image4              = Venom Space Knight Vol 1 3 Panosian Variant Textless.jpg\n| Image4_Text         = Panosian Variant Textless\n| Month               = 3\n| Year                = 2016\n| ReleaseDate         = 1-27-2016\n\n| Editor-in-Chief     = Axel Alonso\n| Image1_Artist1      = Ariel Olivetti\n\n| Quotation           = [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Flash]].

The cosmos informs Flash of trouble on a volcanic world, a war between a species of Amazonian Medeusa-like aliens and a species of igneous creatures. Flash detaches himself from the Venom symbiote due to its weakness to intense heat, and dons a suit of powered armor 803 calls a rumble suit. When Flash arms himself with a gun, 803 informs him that due to the planet's volatile atmosphere he won't be able to use it or the suit's armaments, instead presenting him with a sword.\n\nAs Flash lands on the planet, 803 informs him that he only has 30 minutes before the suit melts. Flash is attacked by one of the Medusa-like aliens and activates a translator. The alien introduces herself as Iqa, the queen of the Wugin, accusing him of being one of the Usurpers who have destroyed her planet. Flash explains that he came to help restore the planet, and Iqa warily calls off her attack, informing him that three cycles prior a comet crashed into the Great Eye, a volcano sacred to her people, causing it to erupt. Flash tells her that it was a piece of technology, impressing her with his intelligence due to the males of her species being slow and only useful for breeding. Flash asks about the igneous creatures her warriors are fighting, and she tells him they are the Underdwellers, who live inside the Great Eye and blame the Wugin for its eruption. Battling their way through a horde of Underdwellers, Flash and Iqa arrive at the top of the Great Eye. 803 warns Flash that the rumble suit might not be able to withstand being submerged in lava, but Flash says it'll melt anyways. 803 asks for permission to fly Flash's ship into the nearest star should he not survive, but Flash tells him to spend eternity writing songs in his honor instead. Diving into the volcano, Flash destroys the device destabilizing the volcano and is pulled out of the lava by Iqa, who tells him that her planet has been restored and she is indebted to him. Flash starts to tell her it was nothing, but she interrupts by kissing him and offering him a place in her husband stable. Flash politely refuses and returns to his ship.\n\nOnboard his ship, Flash tells 803 he kissed an alien, and the robot wonders if he isn't technically kissing the Venom symbiote while wearing it, ruining the moment. Flash tells 803 he miscalculated the rumble suit's durability, only for it to promptly fall apart. As Flash leaves to take a nap, 803 tells him he has prepared something special in the med bay. \n\nAs Flash's ship departs, Tubin's ship arrives. Tubin reports to Mercurio that Flash destroyed their Seed and asks if they should replace it, but Mercurio tells him to pursue Venom instead. Tubin informs Mercurio that Flash is headed for Xffgath, and Mercurio orders him to unleash Pik Rollo. Tubin opens a cell door to reveal a massive, growling silhouette with glowing red eyes. \n\nIn the med bay, 803 presents Flash with a pair of prosthetic legs, overjoying him. Flash notes he'll need a cane while figuring out a physiotherapy routine, and 803 states he can make one from the remains of the rumble suit. Flash stops abruptly and asks who's flying the ship, and 803 informs him the Symbiotes is at the helm. As Flash rushes into the cockpit, the Venom symbiote - in humanoid form despite not having a host - turns to face him and says they need to talk.\n\n| Appearing1          = \n'''Featured Characters:'''\n* {{a|[[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Flash Thompson]]}}\n'''Supporting Characters:'''\n* {{a|[[803 (Earth-616)|803]]}}\n* {{a|[[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom Symbiote]]}}\n* {{1st|[[Iqa (Earth-616)|Iqa]]}}\n'''Antagonists:'''\n* {{1st|[[Underdwellers]]}}\n* {{a|[[Gramosians|Gramosian]]}} Space Pirates\n** {{a|[[Tubin (Earth-616)|Tubin]]}}\n** {{a|[[Mercurio (Earth-616)|Mercurio]]}}\n** {{1st|[[Pik Rollo (Earth-616)|Pik Rollo]]}} {{Shadow}}\n'''Other Characters:'''\n* {{Mentioned|[[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]]}}\n* {{1st|[[Wugin]]}}\n'''Locations:'''\n* {{1st|[[Gorfin-7]]}}\n* Unnamed volcanic planet\n** The Great Eye\n* Xffgath {{Mentioned}}\n'''Items:'''\n* Rumble Suit\n'''Vehicles:'''\n* Flash's ship\n* Tubin's ship\n\n| Solicit             = VOLCANO?

When Flash asks if that's not what 803 wanted, the robot responds that he only wants his own destruction, not that of anyone else. Flash takes note of 803's concern but assures him that his role in the plan is one of the most difficult, and that he most likely won't live to see Flash's betrayal and death. 803 asks if this is meant to reassure him, and Flash says no but that if 803 can't trust Pik Rollo than he should trust him. Entering a room, Flash sits across from the Venom symbiote and asks if it is ready. the Symbiotes replies that it is ready for any outcome and asks the same of Flash, who responds that they'll have to find out.\n\nLater, Flash, the Venom symbiote, and Pik Rollo enter a missile launch tube. As the symbiote envelopes them and takes on the shape of a missile, Pik asks if Flash is sure the plan will work. Flash assures her that they'll get her kid back as long as they survive the next stage of the plan. The symbiote-missile launches from Flash's ship towards one of Mercurio's bases on a moon. The landing is successful, and Venom and Pik make their way towards Mercurio's base, with Venom telling her that the plan worked. She prays that she never has to endure something like that again, and when Venom teases her she tells him to be quiet. \n\nIn the base, two Gramosian soldiers patrol the base, one voicing complaints to the other. Venom and Pik Rollo approach, and Venom notes that they're not running and asks if he's lost touch with his intimidating side. Pik responds that he's less than intimidating, but Venom realizes that the guards aren't running or sounding the alarm. Realizing Pik betrayed him, Venom confronts her as they are surrounded by Gramosian soldiers. Pik apologizes, but Venom attacks in a rage as the guards try to restrain him. Pik retorts that she had no choice and had to protect her child no matter the cost. Venom is beaten down and the Gramosians use a sonic weapon to separate Flash from the symbiote. Mercurio himself approaches and Flash tries to attack him, but is easily knocked aside. Drawing a sword, Mercurio cuts the feet off Flash's prosthetics and prepares to finish him off, but Pik tells him to wait: he needs Flash alive in case his plan doesn't work and someone has to tell him how to fix the symbiote. Realizing Mercurio intends to take the Venom symbiote for himself, Flash threatens him but is knocked out. Mercurio tells his soldiers to take Flash to the Pit and kneels to examine the symbiote, saying he is in Pik Rollo's debt and that she played her part well... too well. As Pik lunges at him from behind, Mercurio sends an electrical current through the ground, stunning her. Pik gets up to continue fighting for her daughter's sake, but Mercurio shouts that her child belongs to him, enraging her. Mercurio easily defeats her and knocks her out with an electrical shock, telling his guards to take her to the pit as well. He turns to to address the symbiote, telling it that it is time for it to be what it once was.\n\nIn the Pit, Pik Rollo is tossed next to Flash, who tells her the plan worked. Pik retorts that if she wasn't in so much pain she'd break him. Bonded to a maniacally-laughing Mercurio, the Venom symbiote echoes Flash's narration to 803, stating that it wasn't always a good guy and that it changed, but that being good was fun while it lasted.\n\n| Appearing1          = \n'''Featured Characters:'''\n* {{a|[[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Venom (Flash Thompson)]]}} {{g|Loses the Venom symbiote}}\n'''Supporting Characters:'''\n* {{a|[[803 (Earth-616)|803]]}}\n* {{a|[[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom Symbiote]]}}\n* {{a|[[Pik Rollo (Earth-616)|Pik Rollo]]}}\n'''Antagonists:'''\n* {{a|[[Gramosians|Gramosian]]}} Space Pirates\n** {{a|[[Mercurio (Earth-616)|Mercurio]]}} {{g|Bonds to the Venom symbiote}}\n** Unnamed pirates\n'''Other Characters:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man (Peter Parker)]]}}\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Victor von Doom (Earth-616)|Doctor Doom (Victor von Doom)]]}}\n* {{Mentioned|[[Hilla (Earth-616)|Pik Rollo's child]]}}\n'''Locations:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Earth]]}}\n** {{FlashOnly|[[United States of America]]}}\n*** {{FlashOnly|[[New York (State)|New York]]}}\n**** {{FlashOnly|[[New York City]]}}\n***** {{FlashOnly|[[Queens]]}}\n****** {{FlashOnly|[[Forest Hills]]}}\n******* {{FlashOnly|[[Midtown High School]]}}\n* Unnamed Half-Destroyed Planet\n** Gramosian Space Pirates' outpost\n'''Items:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Doctor Doom's Armor]]}}\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Spider-Man's Suit|Spider-Man's Red-and-Blue costume]]}}\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Web-Shooters]]}}\n* Flash's prosthetic legs\n* Gramosian sword\n'''Vehicles:'''\n* Flash's ship\n\n| Solicit             = PIK ROLLO IS A GIANT SPACE PANDA BEAR\n\n\u2022 And she is tough as %&#$, while still being adorable.\n\n\u2022 But she needs some help from VENOM to rescue her child (also ADORABLE) from our big cosmic bad guy, who wants Venom dead.

Tarna agrees, but Flash says that the Venom symbiote is sending him the message that the destruction is all his fault. Pik Rollo asks if he means that the symbiote is wronging the rights it had helped fix, wondering why, and Flash responds that the symbiote is trying to show them it's an agent of chaos, not the Cosmos. Tarna tells Flash she's contacted the other Agents of the Cosmos and that they are looking in on the planets Flash had helped save. Flash thanks her, since now they can focus on finding Venom, but Tarna tells him that he should step back and let her and the others handle it. Flash retorts that he's not going to let her kill the Venom symbiote no matter what it's done, and Tarna assures him that she's only trying to contain it, worrying what will happen if it bonds with him in its current state. Flash asks what she means, and Tarna explains that just as evil hosts will corrupt a klyntar, an evil klyntar will corrupt its host - something Flash experienced with Venom in the past. Tarna says that while Flash cares about Venom, it's beyond redemption, asking him not to take the monster's bait. 803 interrupts to tell Flash that they've found Venom on a pleasure planet. Flash tells 803 to set a course for that world, apologizing for what Venom did to Tarna's klyntar but saying that he's the one who has to stop Venom from hurting anyone else.\n\nIn a bar on the pleasure planet, the barkeeper tells Flash and his team that Venom came in, beat up the other patrons, and drank everything but the cheapest bottle in the joint, which it said to leave for its \"drinking buddy\" - mocking Flash over his past struggles with alcoholism. Tarna apologizes and says the Agents of the Cosmos will pay for the damages, but Flash smashes the bottle and storms out. Tarna follows, arguing with him over taking Venom on. Inside their ship, Hilla asks her mother when they'll fight again. Pik relies that she hopes not for a while, and Hilla asks if she's afraid of the Venom symbiote. Pik responds that she's not, but that anger is a dangerous force that cares not for anything it destroys. Just as Hilla tells her mother she'll protect her, the Venom symbiote bursts from a vent and collapses the room on top of them, telling them to stay. As Flash and Tarna are about to enter the ship, Venom attacks and Tarna knocks Flash out of the way. The symbiote mocks Flash, asking if he's feeling thirsty and swatting Iqa aside as she tries to ambush it from behind. Stating that it's good to be back to its old self again, Venom says it's missed Flash. Tarna intervenes, calling it a corrupt abomination, but the symbiote laughs her attack off. Flash orders the others to fall back, but Iqa refuses to leave. Tarna begins to say that leaving sounds like a good idea, but is slammed into a wall before she can finish. Iqa frees Tarna, but Venom incapacitates her and leaves for Tarna's ship with Flash in pursuit, calling out for it to stop. Flash boards the ship as it takes off. As the team regroups and stares after the ship, noting theirs is too damaged to pursue, Tarna tells them to pray to whatever gods they believe in.\n\nOnboard the ship, the Venom symbiote tells Flash that it only wants to show him the truth, what both it and he truly are. Flash attempts to pilot the ship, but the symbiote has disabled the manual override. Flash asks where the symbiote is taking him, and it responds that they are going to where it all began, landing on a icy planet. Flash cracks a joke about it being Santa Claus, but the symbiote chastises him and directs him down a path through the frigid wilderness. As Flash walks, the symbiote reveals the planet they are on is where its first host was born. Flash asks if the symbiote is going to kill him, but the symbiote corrects him, stating that it is a day of rebirth. As Flash comes across a massive cemetery, the symbiote reveals it was corrupted long before Deadpool, Spider-Man, or Eddie Brock bonded to it: its original host was a cruel and twisted being who used it to annihilate everything on his homeworld. Staring into an open grave, Flash tells the symbiote that the genocide wasn't its fault, but it rebukes him, saying that however much they might deny it, they're both evil and agents of death. The grave's tombstone - bearing Flash's name - transforms into the symbiote, which looms over Flash as it tells him to accept his fate and achieve his true potential, enveloping him while proclaiming \"Long live Venom!\"\n\n| Solicit             = KLYNTAR\u2019S LAST HUNT\n\n\u2022 A symbiotic relationship has become one of HUNTER and PREY.\n\n\u2022 Since separating from Flash, the Venom symbiote has left a trail of destruction in his wake.\n\n| Notes               = \n| Trivia              = \n| Recommended         = \n| Links               = \n}}"}}}]}, "18186": {"pageid": 18186, "ns": 0, "title": "Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)", "revisions": [{"slots": {"main": {"contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki", "*": "{{Marvel Database:Character Template\n| Image                   = Venom Vol 4 35 Jock Virgin Variant.jpg\n| Name                    = Unknown\n| Name2                   = <br>(The symbiote takes the name of its current host)\n| CurrentAlias            = [[Venom (Symbiote)|Venom]]\n| CurrentAliasRef         = \n| Codenames               = The [[Black Suit]]{{citation}}\n| EditorialNames          = \n| Nicknames               = Symby{{r|Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man Vol 1}}\n| Impersonations          = \n| Aliases                 = 998th,<ref>In {{cl|Venom Vs.

The symbiote was eventually bonded to a soldier named [[Tel-Kar (Earth-616)|Tel-Kar]], and underwent months of training alongside him before they were dispatched to fight in the [[Kree-Skrull War]], acting as a deep-cover spy, saboteur, and assassin. When Tel-Kar broke cover to rescue a ship of Kree refugees, he separated from the symbiote and erased its memories of him in case it was captured. Tel-Kar instructed the leader of the refugees to take the symbiote to [[Hala (Planet)|Hala]], but the symbiote left them to search for Tel-Kar and was abandoned by the refugees to be marooned on a planet when the ship crash-landed.{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1 1}}\n\n[[File:Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616) and his Original Host from Venom Space Knight Vol 1 12 0001.png|left|thumb|Venom's genocidal \"first\" host.]]\nAt some point, the symbiote bonded to an alien native to an icy world - who it later recalled as its first host - believing him to be a noble warrior and worthy host.

Spider-Man found the prison module the symbiote had been trapped in and activated the machine, which released the symbiote in the form of a black sphere. When Spider-Man touched the symbiote, it covered his body and formed into a black-and-white costume with large white spider-emblems on its chest and back derived from Knull's dragon emblem,{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RyanStegman/status/1025861912876134400|title=ryan stegman on Twitter: \"Yeah.

Confused as to why he was constantly exhausted and increasingly unnerved by his new costume's autonomy, Spider-Man took it to the Fantastic Four for analysis on the advice of his girlfriend, [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Black Cat]]. Upon learning the \"black suit\" was not only alive but sentient, and wished to permanently bond with him, Peter rejected it out of shock and disgust. With the aid of [[Reed Richards (Earth-616)|Mr. Fantastic]] and the [[Jonathan Storm (Earth-616)|Human Torch]], Spider-Man discovered the symbiote was vulnerable to sound and intense heat, and he used sonic waves to remove it and flames to scare it into a containment module.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #252|258}} When five-year-old [[Franklin Richards (Earth-616)|Franklin Richards]] strayed into his father's laboratory, the symbiote attempted to communicate with him but was left frightened by his untapped potential.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 260}} Some time later, the symbiote escaped briefly with the help of [[Kristoff Vernard (Earth-616)|Kristoff Vernard]] and possessed Mr. Fantastic in order of take revenge against Spider-Man; later trying to possess a stronger body, attacking the [[Baxter Building]] and possessing the [[Susan Storm (Earth-616)|Invisible Woman]] before possessing Franklin. Franklin rejected the symbiote with the help of Spider-Man and Reed, and it was imprisoned again.{{r|Spider-Man / Fantastic Four Vol 1 2}} \n\nAngered at having been rejected and imprisoned, the symbiote escaped and took over a tourist named [[Leonard Elkhart (Earth-616)|Leonard Elkhart]], using him to make its way back to Peter's closet, where it disguised itself as a spare red and blue uniform. When the [[Vulturions (Earth-616)|Vulturions]] attacked, the symbiote revealed itself and attempted to forcibly bond to Spider-Man, who fled to the bell tower of the [[Our Lady of Saints Church]]. The bells rang to sound the hour, which - coupled with Spider-Man's rejection of it - weakened the alien and forced it to relinquish its hold on him. The symbiote, using its remaining strength, dragged Peter to safety before fleeing through the cracks of the floor to the lower levels of the church, which would lead Spider-Man to assume the symbiote had actually perished.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Vol 1 1}}{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 1}} Parker's repeated rejections left the symbiote extremely bitter toward him, a trait it would share with most of its future hosts.{{r|Web of Spider-Man #1}} \n\nAfter recovering from its injuries,{{r|Fall of the Hulks: Alpha #1}} the symbiote found itself being hunted by a trio of alien bounty hunters - [[Killer Thrill (Earth-616)|Killer Thrill]], [[Guzz (Earth-616)|Guzz]], and [[Coldwar (Earth-616)|Coldwar]] - and reunited with Deadpool.{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 1}} Over the course of a single night, \"Venompool\" slaughtered a squadron of [[Zn'rx]] attempting to abduct the [[Power Pack (Earth-616)|Power Pack]],{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 2}} fought [[Lorina Dodson (Earth-616)|White Rabbit]] alongside Black Cat,{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 3}} fought [[Sergei Kravinoff (Earth-616)|Kraven the Hunter]],{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 4}} and devoured Killer Thrill's left arm - forcing the bounty hunters to flee empty-handed. However, the symbiote's growing rage towards Spider-Man led to it having a falling-out with Deadpool, and it returned to Our Lady of Saints Church.{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 5}} \n\n===Bonding to Eddie Brock===\n[[File:Venom origin in church.jpg|left|thumb|Venom is born.]]\nThe symbiote's third human host, [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]], had been a reporter for the Daily Globe who was fired after Spider-Man debunked his story exposing the identity of the [[Stanley Carter (Earth-616)|Sin-Eater]], humiliating him and ruining his career to the point where he could only find work with cheap gossip magazines. Contemplating suicide after being disowned by [[Carl Brock (Earth-616)|his abusive father]] and divorced by [[Anne Weying (Earth-616)|his wife]], Eddie entered Our Lady of Saint's Church to pray for forgiveness. Attracted by his mutual hatred towards Spider-Man, the symbiote bonded with Eddie, suggesting the name \"[[Venom]]\" for their merged form.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Annual Vol 1 8}} However, Eddie's hatred for Peter further twisted the symbiote's own feelings towards its former host into a fixation with either reclaiming or killing him.{{r|Venom: Dark Origin Vol 1 4}}{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 5}}{{r|{{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 3}}-{{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 5|5}}}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 4}}\n\n[[File:Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 316 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Venom vs. Spider-Man]]\nWhen bonded, Venom spoke using the first person plural (we), signifying that Brock and the symbiote were two separate entities joined together - although, on occasion, Eddie referred to it as \"My Other and I\". They fought Spider-Man many times, and came close to winning on several occasions. By this time, Spider-Man had married [[Mary Jane Watson (Earth-616)|Mary Jane Watson]], and Venom scared her horribly, causing her to ask Spider-Man to stop wearing the black costume and return to his original suit.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #298|300}}\n\nDespite its bond to Eddie, the symbiote viewed him as an inferior host and saw Spider-Man as its soul mate, frequently making efforts to return to him in between attempts to kill him.{{r|Venom: Dark Origin Vol 1 5}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 317}}{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 3}} The symbiote also began manipulating Eddie's memories and biochemistry to make him believe he had [[Daniel Brock (Earth-616)|a deceased uncle]] and [[Mary Brock (Earth-616)|a sister]], and that he had been diagnosed with cancer; gaslighting him into staying bonded to it whenever he questioned their relationship.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 11}}-[[Venom Vol 4 12|12]]}}\n\n===From Villain to Lethal Protector===\nDuring a battle between Spider-Man, [[Jacob Eichorn (Earth-616)|Styx]], and Stone, the symbiote was seemingly killed by Styx's lethal touch.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 333}} It recovered and sought Eddie out, freeing him from prison while leaving an asexually-produced spawn behind, which bonded to serial killer [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Cletus Kasady]] and became known as [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 361}} At this time, the symbiote and Eddie had settled more-or-less peacefully on [[Isla de Huesos]] after seemingly killing Spider-Man,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 347}} and was less than pleased to learn he had survived. When Carnage proved more powerful than its progenitor, Spider-Man revealed his survival to Venom and arranged a temporary truce to subdue him.{{Citation}}\n\nVenom eventually arranged a truce with Spider-Man and relocated to [[San Francisco]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #375}} becoming the defender of the [[Underground City]].{{r|{{cl|Venom: Lethal Protector Vol 1 1}}-{{cl|Venom: Lethal Protector Vol 1 6}}}} The symbiote's ability to reproduce asexually attracted the attention of the [[Life Foundation (Earth-616)|Life Foundation]], who captured Venom and temporarily separated Eddie from the symbiote. While captive, the Venom symbiote was forced to give birth to five offspring - [[Riot (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Riot]], [[Lasher (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Lasher]], [[Phage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Phage]], [[Agony (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Agony]], and [[Scream (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Scream]] - who were bonded to PMCs hired by the Life Foundation.{{r|{{r|Venom: Lethal Protector #4}}{{cl|Venom: Separation Anxiety Vol 1 1}}-{{cl|Venom: Separation Anxiety Vol 1 4}}}} When corrupt corporation Scarmore Inc. hired the Juggernaut to act as an enforcer and kill [[Beck Underwood (Earth-616)|Beck Underwood]] - a lawyer allied with the Underground City and Eddie Brock's girlfriend - the Venom symbiote was exposed to a sentient Mercury Virus engineered by Scarmore Inc., augmenting it but also driving it and Eddie insane. Driving off the Juggernaut, the symbiote and Eddie were pulled into the [[Realm of Madness]] but managed to escape and expelled the virus.{{r|{{cl|Venom: The Madness Vol 1 1}}-{{cl|Venom: The Madness Vol 1 3}}}}\n\nWhen Eddie's ex-wife [[Anne Weying (Earth-616)|Anne Weying]] was mortally wounded after being shot by the second [[Michael Engelschwert (Earth-616)|Sin-Eater]], Eddie urged the Venom symbiote to bond with and heal her. Under the influence of the symbiote, Anne impulsively murdered a pair of thugs, an act she instantly regretted.{{r|Venom: Sinner Takes All #3}} The symbiote returned to Eddie, but when he was incapacitated it rebonded to Anne and almost caused her to eat a deranged woman seeking revenge on Eddie for the crippling of [[Kirstin (Earth-616)|her daughter]]'s boyfriend.{{r|Venom: Sinner Takes All #5}}\n\n===[[Planet of the Symbiotes (Event)|First Invasion of the Symbiote Hive]]===\nSuspecting the negative influence the symbiote's bloodlust was having on him, Eddie rejected it and in its despair, the symbiote unleashed a psychic scream that accidentally alerted the [[Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-616)|Symbiote Hive]] to Earth's location.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Super Special Vol 1 1}} When the Hive attacked, the Venom symbiote disguised itself as [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Ben Reilly]]'s hoodie and was pulled through a stargate the invasion force had constructed to a world the Hive had already conquered.<!--{{r|Venom Super Special Vol 1 1}}-->\n\nRevealing itself, the Venom symbiote rebonded to Eddie and conveyed some of its backstory to him, Spider-Man, and the Scarlet Spider.{{r|Venom Super Special Vol 1 1}} To save the Earth, the symbiote rebonded to Eddie - seemingly permanently - and released another psychic scream of despair that caused most of the invading symbiotes to commit suicide.{{r|Web of Spider-Man Super Special Vol 1 1}}\n\nIn the wake of the Symbiote Invasion, Anne was taken into police custody and used as bait to lure Venom into an ambush; Eddie sending the symbiote through the phone's landline to jailbreak her. As She-Venom, Anne again succumbed to the symbiote's bloodlust but returned the symbiote to Eddie when he was mortally wounded.{{r|{{cl|Venom: Along Came a Spider Vol 1 3}}-{{cl|Venom: Along Came a Spider Vol 1 4}}}} The Venom symbiote also became the target of a [[Xenophage]] that had been drawn to Earth following the Symbiote Invasion, forcing Venom to team up with Scream to defeat it.{{r|{{cl|Venom: The Hunted Vol 1 1}}-{{cl|Venom: The Hunted Vol 1 3|3}}}}\n\n===Growing Corruption and Separation from Eddie===\nAs the symbiote's bloodlust grew, it began attempting to force Eddie to satiate its growing appetite for flesh, as it had previously with Anne Weying,{{r|{{cl|Venom: Sinner Takes All Vol 1 3}} - {{cl|Venom: Sinner Takes All Vol 1 5|5}}}}{{r|{{cl|Venom: Along Came a Spider Vol 1 3}} - {{cl|Venom: Along Came a Spider Vol 1 4|4}}}} and abandoned him when he refused to do so. The rampaging symbiote attempted to devour Eddie, who was able to temporarily curb its hunger using chocolate.{{r|{{cl|Venom: The Hunger Vol 1 1}}-[[Venom: The Hunger Vol 1 4|4]]}}{{r|Marvel Comics Presents Vol 3 5}} Despite Eddie's best efforts to suppress its predatory urges,{{r|Venom: The Hunger Vol 1 1}} the occasions when the symbiote's bloodlust overwhelmed him and he was forced him to satiate its ravenous hunger caused him to begin to distrust and fear its influence over him.{{r|Venom Vol 2 35}}{{r|Spider-Man / Red Sonja Vol 1 2}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 158}} \n\nThe symbiote was briefly separated from Eddie by [[Stewart Ward (Earth-616)|Senator Ward]], who wanted to study it to better understand his own alien affliction,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 22}} though it was eventually returned to him. After Eddie lost his memories following his stint as a government agent, the symbiote influenced him into relapsing into villainy as Venom and attempting to eat [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]] and Spider-Man.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 16}} When the symbiote's gaslighting of Eddie by manipulating biochemistry to trick him into thinking he had terminal cancer caused him to actually develop the disease,{{r|Venom Vol 1 11}} the symbiote sought to forsake him and once more began hunting prey on its own; attempting to rebond to Spider-Man and expressing outrage when he tricked it into rebonding to Eddie.{{r|{{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 1}} - {{cl|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 5|5}}}} \n\nDuring a battle between Venom, Spider-Man, and the Fantastic Four, the symbiote's tongue was severed and wound up in the possession of the [[Ararat Corporation (Earth-616)|Ararat Corporation]], which used it to create [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a modified clone of the symbiote]].{{r|Venom Vol 1 11|13}} The Ararat Corporation intended for the bloodthirsty and sadistic clone to be assimilated by the original symbiote, whereupon it would induce the gestation of an army of symbiotes to exterminate all life on Earth.{{r|Venom Vol 1 16}} Several months later the original Venom symbiote succeeded in absorbing its clone and decided to follow through with the Ararat Corporation's plan, though for unknown reasons it never came to pass.{{r|Venom Vol 1 18}} The Venom symbiote also assimilated a significant amount of the Carnage symbiote, which attempted to take it over from the inside and may have contributed to its growing bloodlust.{{r|Peter Parker: Spider-Man Vol 1 10}}\n\nFully taking over Eddie, the Venom symbiote attempted to coach the Carnage symbiote through the birth of its first offspring, which it dubbed [[Toxin (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Toxin]]. Venom initially planned to train Toxin, whose host was a [[Patrick Mulligan (Earth-616)|policeman]], but formed a temporary truce with Carnage in an unsuccessful attempt to kill it lest it turn on them and prove too powerful to stop.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vs. Carnage Vol 1 1}}-[[Venom Vs. Carnage Vol 1 4|4]]}}\n\nHaving a Christian reawakening after watching the ''Passion of Christ'', Eddie was unable to stomach the symbiote's bloodlust and decided to expunge himself of it by selling it at a super villain auction and donating the money to charity. The symbiote was purchased by [[Maggia (Earth-616)|Maggia]] don [[Vincente Fortunato (Earth-616)|Vincente Fortunato]], who gave it to his son [[Angelo Fortunato (Earth-616)|Angelo Fortunato]].{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man Vol 1 7}} \n\n===Descent Into Villainy===\n[[File:Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616) and Angelo Fortunato (Earth-616) from Marvel Knights Spider-Man Vol 1 8 0001.png|thumb|right|Leaving Fortunato.]]\nAfter bonding to Angelo, the symbiote revealed Spider-Man's secret identity to him and they attacked Peter Parker at a class reunion. As Venom, Angelo quickly learned how to use the symbiote's powers and initially overwhelmed Spider-Man, but after he killed a civilian dressed as the superhero Spider-Man stopped holding back and turned the tables against the fledgling super villain. When Angelo fled from Spider-Man, the symbiote deemed him an unworthy host and scornfully abandoning him to fall to his death while he was jumping between buildings.{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man #5|8}}\n\n[[File:Absolute Carnage Miles Morales Vol 1 2 Codex Variant Textless.jpg|left|thumb|Bonded to [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Mac Gargan]]]]\nThe Venom symbiote later approached [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|MacDonald \"Mac\" Gargan]], who was considered a low-level villain as the Scorpion, offering him new abilities in exchange for killing Spider-Man. Gargan bonded with the creature, which gave him an extra edge as part of [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Sinister Six (Earth-616)|Sinister Twelve]]. Even with these additional powers, he was still swiftly defeated by Spider-Man, as the [[Avengers (Earth-616)|Avengers]] dealt with the rest of the Twelve. Gargan later became a member of a sub-group of Norman Osborn's [[Thunderbolts (Earth-616)|Thunderbolts]], which was drafted by the Avengers to hunt down the members of the fugitive [[Secret Avengers (Civil War) (Earth-616)|Secret Avengers]]. In order to keep the increasingly feral symbiote in check, the government outfitted Gargan with electrical implants. Despite this, over time Gargan's control over the symbiote declined, leading to him expressing nausea and fear of the organism despite being addicted to its power.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 112}} During a battle with the [[Oliver Osnick (Earth-616)|Steel Spider]], Gargan lost control of the symbiote and devoured the antihero's arm.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 115}} Following this, Gargan was ostracized by his teammates; but after being vehemently berated by a hallucination of the alien caused by the third [[Bluestreak (Telepath) (Earth-616)|Bluestreak]] he rapidly embraced the creature's bloodlust and came to gluttonously enjoy indulging its appetite;{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 118|119}} devouring other humans, [[Deviant Skrulls|Skrulls]], [[Homo mermanus|Atlanteans]], [[Kree]], [[Asgardian]]s, and squirrels. \n\nWhen hunting for Spider-Man, the symbiote sensed a former host and led Gargan to Eddie Brock.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 568}} To Gargan's dismay, the symbiote tried to abandon him and return to its former host, who had been cured of his cancer by [[Mister Negative (Earth-616)|Martin Li]]. However, Li's [[Glossary:Lightforce|Lightforce]] powers had altered [[Glossary:Symbiote Codex|remnants of the symbiote]] inside Eddie and caused them to form into a new, mindless symbiote called [[Anti-Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom]].{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 569}} Proving caustic to the Venom symbiote, Anti-Venom nearly killed it, but Gargan managed to escape and it eventually recovered in time to stop him from killing Eddie.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 570}}\n\n[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 570 0001.jpg|left|thumb|Gargan against Venom's former hosts.]]\nAs the symbiote's influence over him grew, Gargan became increasingly monstrous and bloodthirsty. However, in preparation for announcing his Dark Avengers, Osborn developed a symbiote suppressant compound that granted Gargan increased control over the symbiote and allowed him to shift between his Venom form and a smaller form identical to Symbiote Spider-Man at will,{{r|Dark Avengers Vol 1 1}} using this as a way of discrediting their old enemy Spider-Man.{{r|{{cl|Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man Vol 1 1}}-[[Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man Vol 1 4|4]]}}\n\nDuring the Dark Avengers' [[Siege (Event)|Siege]] of [[Asgard (City)|Asgard]], Gargan and the symbiote went on a feeding frenzy before being confronted by [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Ms. Marvel]] and Spider-Man. Ms. Marvel managed to rip Gargan from the symbiote, which promptly bonded to and took over her; mocking Spider-Man while trying to devour him. With Spider-Man's help, Ms. Marvel was able to eventually force the symbiote off herself by flying into some power lines and expelling all the energy she had absorbed from them.{{r|Siege: Spider-Man Vol 1 1}} The symbiote returned to Gargan, but after the Dark Avengers' defeat the [[United States Army (Earth-616)|U.S. Military]] removed it from Gargan and took it into custody for study.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 648}}\n\n===Agent Venom===\nAfter the symbiote was removed from Gargan, the US military established [[Project Rebirth (Earth-616)|Project Rebirth 2.0]], an attempt to weaponize it as a suit of body armor based on the earlier [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|Sym-Soldier Program]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 1}} Through studying the symbiote, the researchers determined that a 48-hour window existed after the first contact with the symbiote until it fully bonded to its host and became more difficult to remove, only permitting recruits to wear it for the duration of missions. After an unsuccessful trial that ended with the recruit - [[Cal Henriksen (Earth-616)|Cal Henricksen]] - losing control and being terminated, the symbiote was assigned to Colonel Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man #654}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 1}} While wearing it, Flash was able to use it to create prosthetic legs and gained spider-powers; reveling in his ability to walk again and emulate his idol Spider-Man. While bonded to Flash, the symbiote took on the appearance of body armor, later manifesting chitinous spikes and a more exoskeletal appearance. To keep it from going on out-of-control feeding frenzies, the Venom symbiote was dosed with [[Symbiote Inhibitor|symbiote suppressant drugs]] intended to lobotomize it. However, the drug was imperfect and unable to fully suppress the symbiote, which frequently used Flash's anger issues to seize control and revert to its monstrous form. As \"Agent Venom\", Flash battled the [[Bennett Brant (Earth-616)|Crime-Master]], and destroyed an illegal shipment of [[Vibranium]]. In retribution for this, the villain kidnapped [[Elizabeth Brant (Earth-616)|Betty Brant]], but gave the location to Flash only if he swore not to bother him anymore. The symbiote seized control when Venom was attacked by [[Jack O'Lantern (Crime-Master's) (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern]] and Spider-Man - who believed he had been the one who kidnapped Betty - but Flash managed to suppress its rampage long enough to tell Spider-Man where she was.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 2 1}}-[[Venom Vol 2 4|4]]}}\n\n[[File:Venom Vol 2 4 Textless.jpg|right|thumb|Introducing: Agent Venom.]]\nDuring Spider-Island, Venom battled the [[Adriana Soria (Earth-616)|Spider-Queen]] and infiltrated her hive dressed as her guard, Spider-King. When the Project Rebirth 2.0 headquarters was attacked, the symbiote temporarily bonded with Samson, a German Shepherd belonging to General [[Brad Dodge (Earth-616)|Brad Dodge]].{{r|Venom Vol 2 #6}} When Flash was dispatched to capture Eddie Brock so that the Anti-Venom symbiote could be used to cure the [[Spider-Virus]], the symbiote abandoned him to rebond to its former host. By this point, Eddie hated the Venom symbiote and was terrified at the prospect of being re-bonded to it, shedding tears as it covered him. While the symbiote was jubilant to return to its former host, Flash was able to convince it to return to him by telling it that Eddie would constantly fight its control.{{r|Venom Vol 2 7}} Along with [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Steve Rogers]], Venom killed the Spider-Queen, but she mutated into a giant spider-monster, which was later killed by [[Kaine Parker (Earth-616)|Kaine]].\n\nFollowing this, the Crime-Master sent [[Jack O'Lantern (Crime-Master's) (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern]] to threaten Flash into carrying out missions for him to protect his family, the first of which was to steal the Toxin symbiote from [[Blackheart (Earth-616)|Blackheart]]'s lair in Las Vegas.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 2 10}}-[[Venom Vol 2 12|12]]}} To protect his family, Flash went AWOL and fully bonded to the Venom symbiote, ending up helping [[Thaddeus Ross (Earth-616)|Red Hulk]] - who had been sent by Captain America to retrieve him and the symbiote, [[Laura Kinney (Earth-616)|Laura Kinney]], and [[Alejandra Jones (Earth-616)|Ghost Rider]] stop Blackheart from unleashing [[Hell]] on Earth.{{r|Venom Vol 2 13|14}} During the [[Circle of Four]], the symbiote secretly bartered with [[Mephisto (Earth-616)|Mephisto]] to receive a [[Hell-Mark]] and seized control of Flash in an attempt to claim the [[Zarathos (Earth-616)|Spirit of Vengeance]] for itself, but was stopped by Blackheart. Flash gave Red Hulk the symbiote in conjunction with Ross bonding to the Spirit of Vengeance, becoming both Venom and Ghost Rider. After the events of Circle of Four, Red Hulk returned the symbiote to Flash.{{r|Venom Vol 2 #13.4}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 41}}\n\nWith Red Hulk's testimony, Flash was pardoned by Captain America in recognition of his heroism and made a member of the Secret Avengers.{{r|Secret Avengers Vol 1 23}} Dispatched to [[Doverton]], [[Colorado (State)|Colorado]] as backup for the [[Mercury Team (Earth-616)|Mercury Team]], the symbiote was accidentally separated from Flash and took over a silverback gorilla that had escaped from a zoo, using it to escape from a horde of other animals being controlled by the [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage symbiote]]. It later left the gorilla and returned to Flash, saving him from being killed by Kasady.{{r|Carnage, U.S.A. Vol 1 5}}\n\nWhile investigating the [[Department of Occult Armaments (Earth-616)|Department of Occult Armaments]], Flash was ambushed by [[Daimon Hellstrom (Earth-616)|Daimon Hellstrom]], who possessed Flash with a powerful demon in an attempt to turn Venom into one of his [[Monsters of Evil (Earth-616)|Monsters of Evil]], which backfired due to the Hell-Mark.{{r|Venom Vol 2 23|25}} To protect his friends and loved ones in New York, Flash subsequently moved to Philadelphia, struggling to cope with the supposedly lobotomized symbiote subconsciously undermining his control. However, he was followed by both [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Toxin]]{{r|Venom Vol 2 31}} and the Jack O'Lantern. When the latter tried to kill his neighbor [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Andi Benton]], Flash sent what he thought was a small portion of the symbiote to protect her (though this would turn out to be the symbiote's clone), which bonded to her. Calling herself Mania, Andi set out to avenge her father using the cloned symbiote, while Flash interrogated the original symbiote to find out what had happened. It scolded him for suppressing it and revealed it had shunted the Hell-Mark onto its clone to keep the demon from taking over them.{{r|Venom Vol 2 38|41}}\n\n===Superior Venom===\n[[File:Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 25 Textless.jpg|left|thumb|The Superior Venom.]]\nWhen Flash returned to New York to investigate rumors that the Crime-Master had returned from the dead, he was attacked by the Superior Spider-Man and his [[Spiderlings (Earth-616)|Spiderlings]]. With the symbiote wounded, Agent Venom revealed his identity to Spider-Man in the hopes that he would be shown mercy, and escaped when Spider-Man tried to kill him.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 22}} Flash sought shelter with his friend Peter Parker, not knowing that he was Spider-Man and had been overtaken by his enemy Otto Octavius. \"Peter\" convinced Flash to undergo surgery to install high-tech prosthesis and used the opportunity to extract the Venom symbiote, intending on containing it in his lab. The symbiote, having grown more powerful in the years since Spider-Man had been its host, broke free and sought to return to its former host.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 23}} Sensing something was different about its old host that it disliked, the symbiote tried to return to Flash, but Otto forced it to remain bonded to him, all while reveling in its power. As the \"Superior Venom\", Otto became even more vicious and aggressive under the symbiote's influence, using extreme violence against even minor infractions and lashing out at Aunt May when she was insensitive towards [[Anna Maria Marconi (Earth-616)|Anna Maria Marconi]]'s height. Mary Jane, thinking Peter had been overtaken by the symbiote, contacted the Avengers,{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 24}} who then engaged Venom in a fight just as he was about to kill some of [[Roderick Kingsley (Earth-616)|Hobgoblin]]'s gang members. With the symbiote's power, Otto was able to fight evenly with them, but he realized too late that the symbiote had been undermining his will and was soon taken over by it. When Flash arrived in Iron Man's armor and tried to convince it to return to him, Venom lashed out in rage at having been controlled by drugs. Unable to suppress it or expel it, Otto gave in to despair but was saved by the remnant of Peter Parker's psyche, who expelled the symbiote. The symbiote returned to Flash, and later informed him something was wrong with Spider-Man.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 25}}\n\nAgent Venom joined Red Hulk's iteration of the Thunderbolts, although the violent methods the group employed undermined his control of the symbiote, enabling it to seize control and go on a feeding frenzy while on [[Frank Castle (Earth-616)|the Punisher]]'s mission to exterminate the [[Paguro Family (Earth-616)|Paguro Family]] and their clients.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 17}} Flash also let the symbiote go berserk against a horde of [[Frost Giants]] in order to attract [[Brunnhilde (Earth-616)|Valkyrie]]'s attention, and later augmented it with Milfour's Dragonhelm in preparation to fight against \"[[Oberoth'm'gozz (Earth-616)|Doctor Strange]]\". The symbiote also devoured several [[True Faeries (Old Ones)|True Fairies]], but freaked out after witnessing their eldritch true forms.{{r|Thunderbolts Annual Vol 2 1}} After this, Flash allowed the symbiote to take control of him in a test to see if the team could take him down, forcing them to work together to subdue it. Red Hulk offered to kill the creature, but Flash - needing it to survive and having become addicted to its power - refused and rebonded himself to it.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 23}}\n\n===Agent of the Cosmos===\nEventually, Captain America asked Flash to take [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]]'s place as a liaison for the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (Earth-616)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. Once in space, the symbiote changed its appearance to lose all semblance of body armor while maintaining an exoskeletal appearance and manifesting a jagged mouth. Sensing the symbiote's return to space, the Symbiotes hive-mind reached out to it across the cosmos and tried to reconnect to it,{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 23}} causing Flash to lose control of it as it lashed out in rage and confusion, taking on an insectoid appearance when berserk.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 21}} Seeking to return to Earth, Flash and the symbiote attacked the Guardians but were separated by [[Peter Quill (Earth-616)|Peter Quill]] and [[Rocket Raccoon (Earth-616)|Rocket Raccoon]]. However, the symbiote escaped containment and took over the nearby Groot.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 21}}\n\n[[File:Venom Space Knight Vol 1 1 Lim Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Venom: Agent of the Cosmos.]]\nAfter being separated from Groot by [[Arthur Douglas (Earth-616)|Drax]], the symbiote took over Rocket, transforming his arms into bio-mechanical multi-barreled guns and demanding the Guardians turn over their ship to it.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 22}} When Drax grabbed hold of Rocket, the symbiote immediately transferred over to him, using him to defeat the other Guardians and pilot [[Cool Interstellar Travel Travelship|their ship]] to its destination: the symbiote homeworld.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 22}} The symbiote separated from Drax of its own accord, whereupon it was cleansed of its hatred and bloodlust, reintegrated into the Symbiotes hivemind, and rebonded to Flash.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 23}}\n\nAfter being purged of its bloodlust, the symbiote took on the appearance of bulky body armor with a face markedly resembling that of the [[Destroyer (Enchanted Armor)|Destroyer]], though it could still manifest its signature fangs and tongue. After being cleansed, the symbiote developed the ability to hear the \"voice\" of the Cosmos, guiding it to those in need of protection; and the ability to take on humanoid form independently of its host for short periods of time.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 4}} Together with Flash, the symbiote acted as an Agent of the Cosmos, seeking to restore order across the universe.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 1|3}} After being separated from Flash by [[Gramosians|Gramosian]] space pirates, the symbiote bonded to their leader, [[Mercurio (Earth-616)|Mercurio]], as part of a ploy on Flash's and the symbiote's part in order to buy time for their allies to arrive and to obtain intel on Mercurio's armada.{{r|{{cl|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 5}}-[[Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 6|6]]}} However, the brief period of time the symbiote spent bonded to the warlord undid its cleansing, and the symbiote eventually went berserk, rampaging across the planets it had helped alongside Flash. Seeking to corrupt Flash, it lured him to its first host's homeworld, where it took him over and it attempted to drive him insane with his darkest memories.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 7|9}} \n\nWith the help of Flash's new allies, the symbiote was subdued and contained, and was taken back to Klyntar to be re-cleansed. Instead, it was placed on trial by the Agents of the Cosmos and nearly executed, but with Flash's help it managed to overcome its bloodlust and learned that its cleansing had failed due to Mania having been corrupted and taken over by the Hell-Mark.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 10}}\n\n===Return to Earth===\n[[File:Venom Space Knight Vol 1 12 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|It's good to be back.]]\nFlash and the Venom symbiote returned to [[Earth]] partly to aid [[Carol Danvers (Earth-616)|Carol Danvers]] against [[Anthony Stark (Earth-616)|Tony Stark]] in the [[Civil War II|second Civil War]], but also to seek out Mania. A spider-bot detected the presence of Flash and the symbiote, tracking them to [[Philadelphia (Pennsylvania)|Philadelphia]]. Believing the symbiote to be evil and that it had taken over his friend, Peter \u2014 as Spider-Man \u2014 ambushed Venom using anti-symbiote technology developed at [[Parker Industries (Earth-616)|Parker Industries]]. Despite both Flash and the symbiote protesting that they didn't want to fight, Spider-Man separated the symbiote from Flash, preparing to imprison it in his lab. Enraged, the Venom symbiote used its ability to take on humanoid form without a host to catch Peter by surprise and easily overwhelmed him. Trying to lead it away from civilians, Spider-Man quipped that they were old friends due to him being a former host, which to his surprise the symbiote didn't remember. The symbiote prevented Spider-Man from fleeing and bonded to him, but instead of taking over him it showed him memories of its birth and first host, explaining its origins and that the cleanse had purged it of all its memories except those of its original host \u2014 who had corrupted it and left it with an addiction to rage \u2014 and Flash Thompson. The symbiote noted that Peter was teeming with rage towards it, and sincerely apologized for everything it had done to him, stating that it was no longer the Venom he knew and hated. The symbiote released Spider-Man and returned to Flash, who explained that he and the symbiote had returned to Earth to find [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Mania]], Venom's corrupted clone and its [[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]]. Accepting that the symbiote had changed for the better, Spider-Man volunteered to help Venom find Mania, and assisted in capturing her before returning to [[New York City|New York]].{{r|{{cl|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 11}}-[[Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 12|12]]}}\n\nAndi, corrupted by the Hell-Mark, tried to take both the Mania and Venom symbiotes from Flash, but Venom's allies arrived in time to stop her and suppress the demonic corruption.{{r|Venom: Space Knight #13}} Some time later the FBI, seeking to return possession of the symbiote to the US Government, hunted Flash down and attacked him with a suit of powered armor equipped with anti-symbiote weaponry, separating him from the symbiote and sending into a feral state. While it regained control of itself, the symbiote did not return to Flash out of shame at enjoying being bloodthirsty and angry.{{r|Venom Vol 1 150}}\n\n[[File:Venom Vol 3 3 Campbell Variant Textless.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lee Price (Earth-616)|New host]], new problems.]]\nIn search of a new host after being separated from Flash Thompson, the symbiote came across former Army Ranger Lee Price when he was about to be gunned down in a shootout between [[Lonnie Lincoln (Earth-616)|Tombstone]]'s gang and Black Cat's gang. It bonded to him to protect him and was initially excited to discover he was a soldier, but was quickly horrified when he dominated it with his will and proceeded to massacre both groups of gangs, forcing the memories of his traumatic childhood on it to shut it up when it protested.{{r|Venom Vol 3 1}} The symbiote subsequently engaged in a mental argument with Lee, berating him over his actions and callous attitude while accidentally revealing its own sanguine past. Unable to directly control Lee due to his Army Rangers training, the symbiote resigned itself to being bonded to him, but attempted to sabotage his application to Black Cat's gang by causing him to vomit, and tried to refuse to aid him in fighting off the assassin sent by Tombstone to kill him - though when injured by flames it lashed out and killed the assassin.{{r|Venom Vol 3 2}}\n\nTwo FBI agents soon learned of Venom's new host and tried to force him into becoming an informant by threatening to reveal his identity to the public if he didn't comply, thus risking turning him into a target for law enforcement agencies and vigilantes.{{r|Venom Vol 3 3}} When the plan of the FBI agents fell through, Eddie Brock and his anti-symbiotic task force set out to capture him.{{r|Venom Vol 3 5}} Spider-Man helped the FBI separate the symbiote from Lee, tricking Venom into thinking he wanted to become its host again. Lee was arrested by the NYPD subsequently while the symbiote was taken to the FBI.{{r|Venom Vol 3 6}}\n\n===Return of the Lethal Protector===\n[[File:Venom Vol 3 6 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|\"We are back!\"]]\nBefore the suit could be handed over to [[Alpha Flight (Space Program) (Earth-616)|Alpha Flight]], Brock broke it free and became Venom once again.{{r|Venom Vol 3 6}} However, he was determined to ensure that his relationship to it was different from what it had been when they first bonded. The symbiote's relapse into corruption made this difficult, as it was violently possessive towards him, viciously attacking a priest who it perceived as undermining Eddie's desire to be bonded to it.{{r|Venom Vol 1 150}} Knowing that the symbiote had recently been heroic and wanting to understand why it was relapsing into its predatory corrupted state, Eddie sought the help of Alchemax,{{r|Venom Vol 1 151}} and learned that his body had been rendered nearly inhospitable to symbiotes a result of being saturated with symbiote suppressant drugs during his time with the FBI.{{r|Venom Vol 1 153}} [[Alchemax (Earth-616)|Alchemax]] decided to help Eddie if he brought [[Vincent Stegron (Earth-616)|Stegron]] to them along with the equipment he stole. Doing so, they gave him a medicine that would rebalance Eddie's metabolism so his body wouldn't reject the Symbiotes.{{r|Venom Vol 1 152|153}}\n\nTogether, they arrested criminals and the symbiote felt good to be a hero again. However, it took too much out of its host's body sometimes making Eddie sleep longer so it can think while watching TV, and subconsciously influencing Eddie in order to fight criminals. The symbiote was concerned at feeling emotions contradictory to those of its host, such as feeling joy in contrast to Eddie's anger when he was unable to sell the television. With the effects of its cleansing ending, the symbiote was able to remember its previous hosts and the influences they'd had on it while lamenting at having been separated from Flash. In its quest for redemption for everything it had done through the years, it payed a visit to the priest it have previously attacked, asking for forgiveness. After a brief conversation, the symbiote realized why Eddie had talked to the priest and it was happy he hadn't died, promising him its protection.{{r|Venom Vol 1 154}}\n\n[[File:Venomverse Vol 1 5 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|War against the Poisons.]]\nA little after, they were summoned to [[Earth-22249|an alternate universe]] by [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-17952)|Venomized]] versions of [[Steven Rogers (Earth-17084)|Captain America]] and [[Stephen Strange (Earth-22249)|Doctor Strange]] to help in [[Venomverse|a multiversal war]] against the [[Poisons]], an extra-dimensional alien race that permanently bond with symbiotes, consuming their hosts' bodies to complete the bonding process and also assimilate their powers. At the last moments, the Venomized Doctor Strange sent the remaining Venoms back home before the [[Hive (Poisons) (Earth-17952)|Poisons]]' ship exploded.{{r|{{cl|Venomverse Vol 1 1}}-[[Venomverse Vol 1 5|5]]}}\n\nAfter returning home, the symbiote's growing corruption renewed its bloodlust, causing it to frequently relapse into its feral, villainous state despite Eddie's efforts to satiate its hunger without resorting to murder or cannibalism. After it attempted to devour a corrupt cop,{{r|Venom Vol 1 155}} Kraven the Hunter,{{r|Venom Vol 1 158}} and the Ringer, Eddie finally became fed up and returned to Alchemax to demand an explanation as to the diminishing effectiveness of the cure. Flash Thompson intervened and demanded Eddie return the symbiote to him, and the symbiote tried to bond to both of its favorite hosts at once. Spider-Man intervened in an attempt to kill it and overturned a vat of serum derived from the Anti-Venom symbiote (which caused the symbiote to be cured from its re-corruption and made Eddie's metabolism return to normal), thus the symbiote biomass bonded to Flash was converted into an [[Anti-Venom II (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|artificial replica of the Anti-Venom symbiote]],{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc. Alpha Vol 1 1}} which he used to forcibly extract the Venom symbiote from Eddie. Despite being unable to rebond to Flash due to the Anti-Venom, the symbiote was nevertheless happy to reunite with its old host, and was left in [[Barbara Morse (Earth-616)|Bobbi Morse's]] bathroom for safekeeping while Spider-Man and Anti-Venom went looking for Lee Price, who had attacked Mania and stolen her symbiote.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 792}} The symbiote eventually decided to escape and destroyed the bathroom before noticing a shard of glass fall down the drain. Escaping into the sewers in search of Eddie, it scared a couple of city workers before finally finding and rebonding with Eddie, who had met up with Black Cat.{{r|Venom Vol 1 159}}\n\nVenom and Black Cat searched for Dr. Steve so they could weaponize the Anti-Venom serum, using it to free Spider-Man - who had been infected by the Maniac symbiote. Venom reluctantly teamed up with Spider-Man, Agent Anti-Venom, and Andi Benton - who had come to New York to help Flash and reclaim her symbiote, still going by the alias as Mania using her hellish powers.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 793}} The six decided to face Maniac, who had infected the Five Families with his symbiote. Using the Anti-Venom serum and the replica of the Anti-Venom used by Flash Thompson, they defeated the [[Inklings (Earth-616)|Inklings]].{{r|Venom Vol 1 160}} However, the small pieces infecting everyone returned to Maniac, who absorbed them to assume a massive form and attempted to forcibly assimilate the Venom symbiote by eating Eddie. However, Spider-Man and Black Cat figured out that they were immune to the Maniac symbiote since they were previously possessed by it. Spider-Man made the Anti-Venom symbiote absorb his blood with the \"Anti-Maniac\" properties, thus allowing its immunity to take down Maniac and revert the symbiote to its original mass and size, though it would still be bounded with Lee Price. After Price was arrested, Flash finally came to the conclusion that the Venom symbiote was safe with Eddie Brock and brokered an uneasy truce between Spider-Man and Venom.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc. Omega Vol 1 1}}\n\n[[File:Venom Vol 1 161 Textless.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting Spider-Woman.]]\nWith Eddie's altered metabolism having been cured by being doused in the Anti-Venom serum, the symbiote was able to recover from its physical and psychological instability, returning to the benevolent state it had been in as an Agent of the Cosmos. When Spider-Woman attacked Eddie, the symbiote temporarily bonded to her to convince her they were turning over a new leaf and revealed that it was about to give birth again - though it chose to keep this a secret from Eddie.{{r|Venom Vol 1 161}}\n\n[[File:Venom Vol 1 162 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|Venom and the X-Men.]]\nWhen the [[X-Men (Time-Displaced) (Earth-616)|time-displaced X-Men]] approached Venom and asked for his assistance, their allies the [[Starjammers (Earth-616)|Starjammers]] having been captured by symbiote-clad bounty hunters, the Venom symbiote tried to persuade an unwilling Eddie to help them. When Eddie obstinately refused to listen to it, the symbiote knocked him out and allowed the Young X-Men to capture them and take them into space. When Eddie regained consciousness, the symbiote persuaded him to help them after hearing that the bounty-hunters had been using their symbiotes as weapons - having been traumatized by the events of the [[Venomverse|war against the Poisons]].{{r|X-Men: Blue Annual Vol 1 1}} The symbiote was confused when Haze Mancer - who had sold symbiotes to the bounty hunters - recognized it, not remembering him.{{r|Venom Vol 1 162}} It recognized Killer Thrill and informed the Young X-Men of her powers through Eddie, and was horrified to discover the Poisons had infiltrated Earth-616,{{r|X-Men: Blue Vol 1 22}} lamenting the loss of several of its brethren and that it was only a matter of time before the Poisons pursued it to Earth.{{r|Venom Vol 1 163}} The symbiote subsequently aided Eddie in defeating the Poisons, destroying the Hive, and returning its captured brethren to Klyntar.{{r|{{cl|Venomized Vol 1 1}}-[[Venomized Vol 1 5|5]]}}\n\n===The Seventh Spawn of Venom===\nAs the time for it to give birth drew closer, the Venom symbiote began to go out of its way to protect its unborn spawn, even if it meant endangering Eddie in the process. Not telling him out of fear that its soon-to-be-born spawn would turn out to be a monster like its others had, the symbiote was almost captured by the FBI's [[Anti-Symbiote Task Force (Earth-616)|Symbiote Task Force]], which wanted to claim the spawn and bond it to Mac Gargan. While the symbiote keeping secrets had formed a rift of distrust between it and Eddie, he took it to Alchemax so Dr. Steve could assist in it giving birth - the labor being longer and more difficult than its previous spawns'. The symbiote agreed to leave its offspring in Dr. Steve's custody until it and Eddie decided the offspring was ready to take a host.{{r|Venom Vol 1 164|165}} \n\n[[File:Peter Parker (Earth-616) and Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800 001.jpg||thumb|left|Together again.]]\nWhen [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]] bonded to the Carnage symbiote to become the Red Goblin, Eddie was blackmailed by [[John Jonah Jameson (Earth-616)|J. Jonah Jameson]] into protecting Mary Jane. Despite teaming up with Spider-Man, Venom was outmatched and only barely managed to fend the Red Goblin off. Exhausted, Eddie decided to lend the symbiote to Spider-Man - giving him a much-needed power boost. Peter reluctantly agreed and the symbiote bonded to him, making him powerful enough to fight toe-to-toe with the Red Goblin. When Flash Thompson was mortally wounded, Symbiote Spider-Man went berserk and Venomized, though Flash managed to calm him down so as to keep the symbiote from being re-corrupted by Peter's rage. As part of a gambit to separate Osborn from the Carnage symbiote, Spider-Man separated from the Venom symbiote and sent it back to Eddie, assuring it that he would be fine when it expressed concern for his safety. After reuniting with Eddie, the symbiote attended Flash's funeral in the shape of a tuxedo.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800}}\n\nShortly afterward, Tel-Kar came to Earth looking for the symbiote, which prompted Eddie to rescue him from the Skrull Warbride [[M'lanz (Earth-616)|M'lanz]]. The symbiote subsequently regained its memories of Tel-Kar, who asked it to leave Eddie and re-bond with him; but when it refused he blackmailed it into bonding to him by threatening to corrupt its spawn, the [[Sleeper (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Sleeper symbiote]].{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1|2}} Tel-Kar dominated the Venom symbiote, suppressing its consciousness and using it to attack a Skrull military installation containing a species-annihilating bio-weapon, but it broke free of his control when he attempted to kill Eddie and its offspring. Tel-Kar forced the symbiote off himself and it rebonded to Eddie, while Sleeper latched on to M'lanz to protect her from the bio-weapon.{{r|{{cl|Venom: First Host Vol 1 3}}-[[Venom: First Host Vol 1 4|4]]}} Venom returned to Earth, severing ties with Alchemax, and when Tel-Kar attacked, the symbiote was disabled protecting its offspring, upon recovering it learned that the Sleeper symbiote had bonded to and lobotomized Tel-Kar before setting off to explore the cosmos.{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1 5}} \n\n===In the Thrall of Knull===\n[[File:Edward Brock (Earth-616) and Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 4 1 001.jpg|thumb|As \"Ancient Venom,\" in the thrall of the Symbiote God.]]\nSome time later, the symbiote began to suffer nightmares of [[Knull (Earth-616)|an ancient and powerful evil deity]] that had been worshiped by the symbiotes in the ancient past. As the symbiote god's influence over it intensified, the Venom symbiote was inflicted with increasingly frequent and intense bouts of insanity and bloodlust. This prompted Eddie to suppress it with anti-psychosis medication and refrain from combat out of fear it would attack innocents, spending several months attempting to figure out what was wrong with it. In the thrall of the symbiote god, the Venom symbiote went berserk and attempted to kill a Jack O'Lantern impersonator and a pair of policemen, but was subdued by [[Rex Strickland (Earth-616)|Rex Strickland]] - a former member of [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|a team of symbiote-enhanced super-soldiers]]. Returned to lucidity, the symbiote helped Eddie attempt to rescue Strickland's former comrades, but was controlled by the symbiote god and forced to separate from him. When Eddie was mortally wounded by one of the controlled super-soldiers, the symbiote snapped out of its stupor and healed him, attempting to explain what was going on as [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a symbiote-dragon]] devoured the super-soldier's symbiotes and went on a rampage.{{r|Venom Vol 4 1}}\n\n[[File:Venom Vol 4 5 Unknown Comic Books Exclusive Virgin Variant.jpg|thumb|left|Venom's newfound ability to create wings.]]\nWhen Eddie confronted Rex over what had happened, the symbiote succumbed to the dark god's control and attacked, though Eddie was able to subdue it with the flames from Rex's blast furnace.{{r|Venom Vol 4 2}} When the new Spider-Man, [[Miles Morales (Earth-1610)|Miles Morales]], attacked, having mistaken Eddie for the [[Conrad Marcus (Earth-1610)|Venom]] that had killed his mother, the symbiote went berserk and nearly killed him before being subdued by a Venom Blast. After the symbiote dragon was defeated by Morales' Venom Blast and Knull - the dark god of the symbiotes - manifested, the symbiote initially submitted itself to him before Eddie's rage over Knull casually killing innocents sent it into a berserk rage. Knull subsequently stripped it from Eddie and attempted to connect it to his hive mind, turning its eyespots red; but it returned to Eddie after Knull was attacked by Morales.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 3}}-[[Venom Vol 4 4|4]]}} Restored to lucidity and with new powers as a result of its brief connection to Knull, the Venom symbiote informed him that Rex was actually [[Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|the last piece of the symbiote-dragon]], merging with him so as to become powerful enough to fight Knull.{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}} Despite being armed with an arsenal of high-power weapons, the Venom and Tyrannosaurus symbiotes were stripped from Eddie and absorbed into the Grendel symbiote, though Eddie detonated said arsenal. Shielded from the blast by the Tyrannosaurus symbiote, the Venom symbiote returned to Eddie. When the Tyrannosaurus symbiote sacrificed itself to drag Knull's avatar into the blast furnace, Eddie sustaining severe burns while holding the door shut. The Venom symbiote was overwhelmed by the intense heat and strain of keeping him alive, and seemingly perished while telling Eddie it loved him.{{r|Venom Vol 4 6}} \n\nThe Venom symbiote survived, seizing control of an unconscious Eddie when he was discovered by [[Interdimensional Council of Reeds (Multiverse)|Project Oversight]] and rampaging for three weeks. Recognizing [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan Brock]] as Eddie's son and fearing that learning this would cause him to abandon it, the symbiote pretended to be brain dead and began suppressing various memories it sensed would be harmful to him;{{r|Venom Vol 1 11}} leading to Eddie not remembering [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|the Maker]]'s repeated attempts to interrogate him over a period of two weeks and forgetting Flash Thompson's death.{{r|Venom Vol 4 7}} \n\n[[File:Venom Vol 4 9 Textless.jpg|thumb|right|As a \"guard dog\".]]\nWhen the Maker revealed that he had extracted a codex - trace remnants of symbiote biomass left in former hosts - from a sample of Flash's blood, and that he intended to exhume and vivisect Flash's corpse in order to extract more; the Venom symbiote went berserk and attacked him. Separating from Eddie in order to restrain the Maker, the symbiote stuffed him in a morgue locker and stole Flash's codex. When they were attacked by guards wielding sonic weapons, the symbiote absorbed the codex and channeled Flash's personality imprint within it, filling the void of its lost awareness; transforming Eddie into Agent Venom. However, the codex eventually burnt out and the symbiote returned to its mindless state.{{r|Venom Vol 4 8}} \n\nWhen Eddie traveled to San Francisco to try to reconcile with his father, the symbiote took on the form of a dog. Eddie's reunion with his father ended disastrously, with Carl saying they never were a family and punching Eddie in the face. This enraged the symbiote, which tried to devour him; but Eddie managed to restrain it and ran away. When a pair of homeless men attempted to break into Eddie's motel room, symbiote discovered that Carnage had returned more powerful than ever, and had taken over the Underground City that Venom had once protected.{{r|Web of Venom: Unleashed Vol 1 1}} Believing himself to be Eddie's younger half-brother, Dylan tried to get Eddie's help to kill their physically-abusive father.{{r|Venom Vol 4 9}} Eddie agreed to make sure the abuse stopped, but he passed out after a vision of Knull, vomiting blood. After Eddie was taken to the hospital, the Venom symbiote put him into a comatose state, cocooning his body.{{r|Venom Vol 4 10}} Engaging in a mental confrontation with Eddie, the symbiote posed as Mary Brock, Eddie's uncle, and his father in an attempt to get Eddie to fully embrace it. However, Eddie was able to see through its deceptions and was outraged that it would trick and lie him after everything they had been through following their reunion.{{r|Venom Vol 1 11}} Rejected by Eddie and separated from him by the Maker, the symbiote incapacitated the evil Reed Richards and used its power to take on an humanoid form without a host to rescue Dylan. Impersonating Eddie to berate Carl Brock in a mental confrontation, the symbiote left him in the desert before taking Dylan to Eddie. Apologizing for what it had done, the symbiote said that both Eddie and Dylan would be better off without it before departing from their lives.{{r|Venom Vol 4 12}}\n\n===Alone and [[War of the Realms]]===\nAlerted to the suffering of another member of its species at the hands of Kulan Gath- who had captured, imprisoned, and tortured it in order to serve as bait,{{r|Savage Avengers #2}} the Venom symbiote arrived to help Logan, the Punisher, [[Elektra Natchios (Earth-616)|Elektra]], and [[Jericho Drumm (Earth-616)|Doctor Voodoo]] fight the eldritch god [[Jhoatun Lau (Earth-616)|Jhoatun Lau]]. Exposure to the Jhoatun Lau's cosmic radiation caused the Venom symbiote to take on the form of a massive dragon similar to the Grendel, letting it hold its own against Jhoatun Lau in combat. Angered after noticing that [[Conan (Earth-616)|Conan]] had bonded to the enslaved symbiote, Venom demanded that he relinquish its dying brethren and got even more angry when he refused. Before they could come to blows, Elektra intervened and proposed they work together until they could vanquish the Marrow God.{{r|Savage Avengers #4}} After Jhoatun's death, it reverted to it's original form and both it and Conan helped Wolverine to damage the god's skull in order to permanently kill it.

The symbiote was ultimately separated from Malekith by Thor, and left to begin preparing for Carnage's imminent attack.{{r|Thor Vol 5 14}}{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 6}}\n\n===[[Absolute Carnage]]===\nLocating Eddie and Dylan in Manhattan, the Venom symbiote rebonded to Eddie to protect him when Cletus pushed them in front of an oncoming subway train. While Eddie was initially reluctant to reunite with it, Cletus transformed into Dark Carnage - a towering skeletal monster - and easily overpowered them. After Eddie escaped by electrocuting Kasady with the subway's third rail, the symbiote put him in a coma so that it could heal him while taking over his body, then walked with Dylan to Peter Parker's apartment before returning control to Eddie.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}}\n\nThe symbiote urged Eddie to set aside his jealousy and anger, and to work together with Spider-Man in order to stop Dark Carnage. When Spider-Man and Venom entered Ravencroft to prevent Dark Carnage from getting Norman Osborn's Carnage codex, John Jameson - who had been infected by the Grendel symbiote - fell under Carnage's control and set off the alarm, incapacitating the Venom symbiote until Eddie shot out the PA system. Before it could fully recover from the sonic attack, the Venom symbiote sensed Dark Carnage infecting the inmates with the Grendel symbiote and began screaming in terror inside Eddie's head. When Dark Carnage threw Spider-Man through Norman Osborn's cell door, Venom incapacitated Osborn - who believed himself to be Cletus Kasady - and barricaded the door using the symbiote. However, Dark Carnage easily kicked him out of the way and bonded Osborn to part of the Grendel symbiote to turn him into Carnage again.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}}\n\nAfter escaping by using the Venom symbiote's ability to create wings, Venom set out to warn the super villains and antiheroes who had bonded to symbiotes in the past, coming across Mac Gargan and Miles Morales fighting against a horde of Carnage Doppelgangers. When Norman Osborn attacked, crippling Gargan and bonding Miles to a portion of the Grendel symbiote,{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 2}} the Venom symbiote speared Osborn through the chest and demanded that Eddie kill him and Miles, while threatening to abandon him for a stronger host if he didn't find the resolve to do what was needed to end the war. After rescuing Gargan and returning to Rex's warehouse, the symbiote asked Eddie to tell Spider-Man the full story regarding the symbiotes' presence on Earth in order to end his persecution complex, and was annoyed when he refused to do so.

It was interrupted by the Grendel symbiote - which had been imprinted with the personality of the original Carnage symbiote, and soon threatened to take over Eddie and force him to kill the Avengers. Silencing both symbiotes with antipsychotic medication, Eddie chartered a [[Quinjet]] to the Isla de Huesos, but the Carnage symbiote awakened and crashed the plane. Stripping the Venom symbiote off Eddie, the Carnage symbiote assimilated it - leaving it unable to do anything except watch as it hunted Eddie across the island in an attempt to take him over.{{r|Venom Vol 4 21|22}} When Dylan tapped into the symbiote hive-mind in order to commune with Knull, the Venom symbiote sensed him and tried to ask him to get help. The Venom symbiote was separated from Carnage when it was struck by lightning while bonding to Eddie, and attempted to rebond to him before the Carnage symbiote could do so.{{r|Venom Vol 4 23}} The Carnage symbiote bonded to Eddie first, forcing the Venom symbiote to flee into the jungle. Contacted by Dylan, who had immersed himself into the Symbiote Hive-Mind, the Venom symbiote allowed him to remote-pilot it and took on the form of a ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' to oppose Carnage.{{r|Venom Vol 4 24}}\n\nThis didn't prove to be enough, as Carnage still got the upper hand, physically and mentally, as Dylan tried to contact his father through the symbiote Hive-Mind. Eddie was imprisoned in a mental Klyntar, so Dylan tried to free him but was imprisoned himself since Carnage was able to control the piece Dylan kept of it. With Eddie's encouragement, both he and his son overcame Carnage's will, with Eddie separating from it and destroying the piece it was controlling. Venom rebonded to Eddie and escaped the isle just in time to warn the Avengers about Knull.{{r|Venom Vol 4 25}} After this, they were suddenly attacked by Virus, which left them to question who he might be.{{r|Free Comic Book Day Vol 2020 Spider-Man/Venom}}\n\nEddie and Dylan met the Maker at his warehouse to question him about Dylan's powers. The Maker simply revealed his plans to study the symbiotes in order to upgrade [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-1610)|his world's Venom symbiote]] to return to [[Earth-1610|his home dimension]]. The Venom Symbiote was frightened by this revelation and how it and Dylan couldn't feel it because of it's synthetic origin, but their conversation was interrupted by an alarm that revealed something was invading the warehouse. As the Maker bid them farewell and good luck in their fight against Knull, Virus appeared and unintentionally destroyed the Maker's portal while attacking. They were all sucked in, and while the Maker returned to his home world, the rest of them were transported to [[Earth-1051]] - a reality where Earth had been conquered by symbiotes.{{r|Venom Vol 4 26}} Virus viciously attacked Venom, but has the symbiote connected itself to that world's Hive-Mind, it gained new abilities, and was able to redirect one of Virus' energy blasts. When Eddie returned to Dylan, Eddie was surprised to see that world's [[Avengers (Earth-1051)|Avengers]]. \n\nHe tried to convince them he wasn't an enemy, but [[Captain America (Symbiote) (Earth-1051)|Captain America]] insisted for him to separate from the Venom symbiote. As it was about to start a fight, Virus attacked Eddie, only to be arrested by the Avengers because of his anti-symbiote tech. Eddie and Dylan got away and followed their way into the sewers, were they meet five versions of the Agent Venom. Believing one of them to be Flash Thompson, Eddie revealed his identity and that Agent Venom revealed to be that world's [[Anne Weying (Earth-1051)|Anne Weying]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 27}} Anne revealed that her son [[Dylan Brock (Earth-1051)|Dylan]], now dubbing himself Codex, was the leader of the [[Hive (Symbiotes) (Earth-1051)|Hive]] and that her [[Edward Brock (Earth-1051)|Eddie Brock]] had killed himself in that world, thus she became Venom instead of him. After Virus attacked their base, now empowered by the [[Scorpion (Symbiote) (Earth-1051)|Scorpion symbiote]], Dylan used his powers to kill it, revealing his identity as Mac Gargan. Eddie decided to use him to get to Codex and fuse both Dylan's memories, hoping it would revert Codex back to normal. Their plan worked, putting that world's Dylan in a coma state. After that, that world has returned to normality and Virus was arrested. The Venom symbiote spent over a year on Earth-1051 with Eddie and his family, and arrived back to Earth-616 just in time to Knull's arrival.{{r|Venom Vol 4 28|30}}\n\n===[[King in Black (Event)|Second Symbiote Invasion]]===\n[[File:Knull (Earth-616), Knull's Symbiote (Earth-616) and Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 4 31 001.jpg|thumb|left|Being assimilated by Knull]]\nIn case the Avengers' initial plan to defeat Knull failed, Eddie and the Venom symbiote came up with a two-part follow-up plan that involved using Thor, [[Ororo Munroe (Earth-616)|Storm]], and the [[Robert Reynolds (Earth-616)|Sentry]] to sever as many symbiote-dragons from Knull's hive-mind as possible, and Venom would use Dark Carnage's throne of living abyss to seize control of them. However, this plan immediately went awry due to Thor being MIA and Knull easily overpowering and killing the Sentry. Deciding to buy Earth some time by giving Knull what he wanted, Venom surrendered and offered to serve Knull in exchange for the Earth being spared. Knull rejected this proposal, instead ripping the Venom symbiote from Eddie and declaring his intent to go after Dylan next.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 1}} Venom begged Knull to let it save Eddie, but Knull absorbed it into his symbiote-armor and all-but extinguished its indivduality.{{r|Venom Vol 4 31}} After Eddie's death, his consciousness was preserved within the Hive-Mind as a codex,{{r|Venom Vol 4 32}} and with help from the codices of Rex Strickland and Flash Thompson he infiltrated the core of the Hive-Mind. When Flash was reborn as a symbiote-dragon, Knull confronted Eddie's codex within the core of the Hive-Mind and attempted to destroy him,{{r|Venom Vol 4 33}} but the Venom symbiote broke free from Knull's control and reunited with Eddie.<!--{{r|Venom Vol 4 34}}-->\n\nPiloted by Eddie's codex, the Venom symbiote was reborn through the living abyss of the symbiote dragons and assumed the form of a giant, attempting to attack Knull directly. However, the [[Glossary:Enigma Force|God of Light]] ripped Eddie's consciousness out of the Venom symbiote and resurrected his body - the Venom symbiote dissipating but promising Eddie it would find him.{{r|Venom Vol 4 34}} After Knull's defeat, the God of Light left Eddie and the Venom symbiote rebonded to him, explaining that as the one who vanquished Knull he was now the new God of the Symbiotes.{{r|King in Black Vol 1 5}}\n\n===Father-Son Bonding Time===\n[[File:Dylan Brock (Earth-616) and Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616) from Venom Vol 4 35 002.jpg|thumb|Bonded to Dylan Brock.]]\nThe Venom symbiote moved into a house purchased by Tony Stark alongside Eddie, Dylan, and Sleeper. However, over the next few months Eddie began to rapidly age due to the strain being the King in Black placed on his still-mortal body. Upon discovering Dylan had been getting into fights at school, Eddie tasked the Venom symbiote with keeping an eye on him, and it seperated from him and once again took on the form of a dog to do so. En route to [[Midtown High School]], Dylan asked the Venom symbiote what its true name was, the symbiote explaining that its kind didn't have names as humans understood them so much as unique emotional wavelengths.<!--{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}}-->\n\nWhile walking back to the Brock residence - Dylan once again having wound up in detention, they noticed Jack O'Lantern mugging an old woman and intervened. The Venom symbiote attempted to frighten Jack O'Lantern away in order to protect Dylan, but this resulted in Dylan being shot in the chest. Out of desperation, the Venom symbiote bonded to Dylan and they beat up Jack O'Lantern together. Shortly afterwards, Eddie revealed he had anticipated something like this occurring. While skeptical of the changes Dylan had made to Venom's appearance, Eddie gave Dylan his blessing to act as Venom and asked his old friend to watch over his son, before informing Dylan of a Goblin sighting.{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}}\n\n==Iterations and Offshoots==\nOver the years, the Venom symbiote has had a number of offshoots created using samples of its living abyss, though most of them have been short-lived:\n\n[[File:Quentin_Beck_(Earth-616)_and_Venom_(Symbiote)_(Earth-616)_from_Symbiote_Spider-Man_Vol_1_4.jpg|thumb|right]]\n* '''Mysterio's Symbiote''' - Desiring to study the properties of the symbiote while it was posing as Spider-Man's black suit, [[Quentin Beck (Earth-616)|Mysterio]] blackmailed [[Felicia Hardy (Earth-616)|Felicia Hardy]] into cutting off a piece and bringing it to him.{{r|Symbiote Spider-Man Vol 1 3}} The symbiote took over Spider-Man and followed her seeking to reclaim its missing piece, but the offshoot refused to return to it and escaped when the [[Wilson Fisk (Earth-616)|Kingpin]] and his men interrupted.

Before coming to Earth, it was only able to understand simple emotions like happiness, anger, and sadness.{{r|Venom Vol 1 154}}\n\nPrior to its cleansing by the Symbiotes hive mind, the symbiote considered Peter Parker to be its ideal host, and through bonding with him it developed a basic understanding of complex emotions.{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 1}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 154}} The heartbreak of Peter's rejection, coupled with the danger it found itself in soon afterward, filled the symbiote with rage towards Spider-Man.{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 4}} While [[Wade Wilson (Earth-616)|Deadpool]] worried that interfacing with his twisted mind would have adverse effects on its sanity,{{r|Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars Vol 1 3}} he attempted to have a positive influence on the creature and persuade it to let go of its rage and hatred.{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 4}} Instead, the symbiote passed its positive emotions towards Spider-Man and desire to do good onto him, leaving it with only rage and hatred.{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 5}} That, possibly combined with the influence of Deadpool's insanity, transformed the desire it still felt for Spider-Man into a vengeful obsession with either rebonding to or killing him; the latter a desire it shared with its third and fifth human hosts, Eddie Brock and Mac Gargan. In spite of considering Eddie to be an inferior host, prior to him bonding to the [[Toxin (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Toxin symbiote]] the Venom symbiote displayed a similar kill-or-reclaim attitude towards him as it did towards Spider-Man.{{r|Venom Vol 2 7}}\n\nAs its corruption worsened, the symbiote became arrogant, scornful, and sadistic; often  berating its hosts for their shortcomings: it openly considered Eddie Brock to be a second-rate host compared to Peter Parker;{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 3}} deemed Angelo Fortunato an unworthy host for not possessing enough \"venom\", leaving him to fall to his death;{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man Vol 1 8}} influenced Mac Gargan into giving in to its bloodlust;{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 118}} and repeatedly criticized Flash Thompson for suppressing it with chemicals.{{r|Venom Vol 2 41}}{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 25}} It possessed an instinctual hatred towards its progeny Carnage and Toxin, stating at one point that familial love was anathema to their kind.{{r|Venom Vs. Carnage Vol 1 1}} Despite this, it has been noted that the symbiote is adverse to lying and as such is brutally honest when permitted to talk.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 23}}\n\nThe symbiote also became increasingly bloodthirsty, twice abandoning Eddie Brock when he refused to satiate its growing hunger for flesh.{{r|Venom: The Hunger Vol 1 1}}{{r|Spectacular Spider-Man Vol 2 1}} Brock described Venom's bloodlust in its corrupted state as being like an ocean of darkness trying to drown him with its rage and hunger, reducing his mind to a \"red ruin\" at its most intense.{{r|Venom Vol 1 158}} When bonded to Mac Gargan, the symbiote's bloodlust grew so intense that its host was initially terrified of its influence over him,{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 112}} and was ultimately driven to willingly commit cannibalism to satiate its ravenous hunger.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 115}} While its understanding of human morality is limited, by the time the symbiote was bonded to Mac Gargan it knew killing and eating sentient beings was bad, but its corruption was so advanced that it didn't care and reveled in being evil.{{r|Venom Vol 1 154}}{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 7|9}} Before the symbiote was cleansed, Flash Thompson had to take drugs to suppress it; but it would frequently exploit his volatile temper to undermine his control, and he often found himself in situations where he had to unleash it to survive.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 2 1}}-[[Venom Vol 2 4|4]]}}{{r|Thunderbolts Annual Vol 2 1}}{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 17}}{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 23}}\n\nThe Venom symbiote has a habit of abandoning its current host to return to a prior one or to seek out a stronger one: attempting to abandon Eddie Brock on several occasions to return to Spider-Man; seeking to leave Mac Gargan and Flash Thompson to return to Eddie Brock once his cancer was cured;{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 569}}{{r|Venom Vol 2 7}} and returning to Spider-Man once separated from Flash Thompson.{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 23}}{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 11}} The symbiote once attempted to leave Flash and bond with Kaine, though Flash prevented it from doing so through sheer force of will.{{r|Scarlet Spider Vol 2 10}} When Flash Thompson tried to reclaim it from Eddie Brock, the symbiote was torn between its two favorite hosts and tried to bond to both of them at the same time, but ultimately chose Eddie due to Flash becoming Agent Anti-Venom.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 792}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 159}}\n\nThe symbiote deeply resented Flash's use of drugs to suppress it, as seen by its berating him in a mental conversation and lashing out at him when bonded to Otto Octavius.{{r|Venom Vol 2 41}}{{r|Superior Spider-Man Vol 1 25}}\n\nAfter being reconnected to the Symbiotes hive mind, the symbiote's memories were purged in order to cleanse it of its bloodlust.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 23}}{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 12}} Following this, the Venom symbiote was repentant, docile, and subservient to Flash, who expressed concern that his own hotheadedness could have adverse affects on it.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 1}} Speaking independently, the symbiote admitted to preferring Flash as a host, and that while it now possessed the ability to operate without a host it preferred being bonded to him, calling him its partner and friend.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 4}}{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 12}} However, following the symbiote briefly bonding to Mercurio, it began to relapse back into its bloodthirsty, hate-filled state.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 7|9}} While it initially reveled in being restored to its old self and attempted to corrupt Flash, after being put on trial by the Agents of the Cosmos the Venom symbiote managed to suppress its rage with Flash's help.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 10}} In a mental conversation with Spider-Man, the symbiote admitted it was addicted to rage as a result of its first host, and expressed genuine remorse for everything it had done to Spider-Man.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 12}} When Venom reabsorbed Mania and took the elixir that would revert its corruption, it became finally pure, although it was revealed that the effects were only temporary and could not prevent the Hell-Mark from re-corrupting its clone.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 13}}\n\nAfter Agent Venom was struck by a beam that separated the symbiote from its host, it relapsed into its corrupted state and abandoned Flash.{{r|Venom Vol 1 150}} Coming to its senses in a weakened state, the symbiote bonded to a homeless man and began searching for a worthy host; ashamed at having reveled in its bloodlust. The Venom symbiote bonded to a former Army Ranger named Lee Price in order to protect him from being shot during a botched arms-deal and was initially overjoyed to be bonded to another soldier, but was subsequently horrified when Lee used it to slaughter the members of Tombstone's and Black Cat's gangs present at a botched arms deal.{{r|Venom Vol 3 1}} Revolted by Lee's callousness and casual attitude towards murder, the symbiote berated and threatened Lee in an attempt to intimidate him, and even attempted to take over him, but was suppressed by his army training. Unable to control him directly, it resigned itself to being bonded to him but was still able to influence his autonomous nervous system in order to sabotage his application to join Black Cat's gang - having somehow regained its memories of its former hosts and recognized Mac Gargan. Given its unwillingness to commit acts of violence, it attempted to refuse to help Lee if he intended to use it to hurt or kill people. However, it was in desperate need of a host and thus forced to compromise, and was unable to stop Lee from abusing its power.{{r|Venom Vol 3 2}} Price's influence began to corrupt the symbiote despite its efforts to oppose him,{{r|Venom Vol 3 4}} and following Spider-Man tricking it and helping the FBI capture it, the symbiote's hatred towards its former host was briefly rekindled,{{r|Venom Vol 3 6}} though it later revealed it knew Eddie had tricked Spider-Man.{{r|Venom Vol 1 151}}\n\nAfter returning to Eddie Brock, the symbiote was re-corrupted but still desired to be a hero. However, its growing rage and bloodlust, coupled with its possessiveness towards Eddie, led to it violently lashing out at and trying to kill those it perceived as threatening its bond with him, such as a priest who suggested Eddie reconsider re-entering into a previously abusive relationship.{{r|Venom Vol 1 150}} Alchemax scientist Dr. Steven determined the main cause of this worsening behavior to be Eddie's metabolism, which had been altered by the symbiote suppressant drugs he took during his stint with the FBI, rendering his body inhospitable to the symbiote. This induced toxic shock syndrome in it, causing it to physically deteriorate and accelerate its psychological degeneration into its corrupted state. Alchemax developed a cure to their condition, causing it to regain its mental stability when dosed with the medication. Recalling its previous hosts, good and bad, and how they had affected it, the symbiote resolved to continue following Flash Thompson's example and apologized to the priest it had previously attacked. Despite initially being afraid, the priest accepted its apology and advised it to do everything int its power to earn the love of those it cared about. Somewhat missing the point, the symbiote decided to do so \"by crushing criminals,\" telling the priest that it was slowly learning.{{r|Venom Vol 1 154}} However, the symbiote's rage and ravenous appetite for flesh returned with its re-corruption, causing problems for Eddie in both his efforts to turn over a new leaf and search for a new job.{{r|Venom Vol 1 155}}{{r|Venom Vol 1 158}}{{r|Amazing Spider-Man: Venom Inc. Alpha Vol 1 1}} After Eddie's altered metabolism was cured by Alchemax's Anti-Venom serum, the Venom symbiote recovered from both its toxic shock syndrome and corruption,{{r|Venom Vol 1 161}} returning to the benevolent state it had been in during its stint with Flash Thompson as an Agent of the Cosmos,{{r|X-Men: Blue Annual Vol 1 1}} though showing willingness to kill when necessary.{{r|Venom Vol 1 161}} With the birth of its seventh spawn, it finally understood the concept of family,{{r|Venom Vol 1 165}} and was angered to learn Alchemax had been exploiting its offspring for selfish purposes.{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1 1}} When Spider-Man bonded with the symbiote to defeat the [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Red Goblin]], even disliking the idea, he forgave the symbiote for all that happened between them in the past, saying for it not to worry about him and to avoid the fire around them when they separated, showing he does care for it.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 800}}\n\nAfter Knull awakened, the symbiote began rapidly oscillating between its lucid \"cleansed\" and bloodthirsty \"corrupted\" states, going berserk in an instinctive show of submission to the symbiote god.{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 1}}-[[Venom Vol 4 4|4]]}} Being partially reconnected to Knull's hivemind restored the symbiote to its pre-Lee Price level of articulateness,{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}} but the psychic backlash of fighting Knull resulted in its personality and voice being erased, leaving it unable to communicate with its host.{{r|Venom Vol 4 7}} The symbiote quickly recovered from this, but out of fear that Eddie would forsake it to look after his son the symbiote resumed gaslighting him by modifying his memories and making him violently ill. Realizing it had done wrong by him, the symbiote left Eddie to seek redemption on its own,{{r|{{cl|Venom Vol 4 11}} - {{cl|Venom Vol 4 12|12}}}} though it still expressed a willingness to indulge its predatory side.{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 3}}\n\nWhen Carnage came after Eddie, the Venom symbiote bonded to him again in order to stop Cletus.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 1}} However, its experiences with Knull had made Venom realize how urgently they needed to stop the symbiote god, making the symbiote leave Eddie behind when his desire to protect Dylan surpassed his desire to kill Cletus and bonding with Hulk in the hopes of gaining enough power to defeat Carnage once and for all.{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 4}}\n\n| Powers                  = '''[[Symbiotes (Race)|Symbiote]] Biology:''' Even without a host, the Venom symbiote is capable of freely extending its biomass into tentacles and tendrils, and usually manifests a fanged mouth and large white eyespots. It can also manifest a humanoid head, torso, and arms; and after being cleansed became able to take on humanoid form without a host for brief periods. When bonded to a host, it can shapeshift to mimic any type of clothing whatsoever, as well as blending Venom in with his surroundings, rendering him invisible. The symbiote has augmented all of its host's physical abilities to superhuman levels equal to, and in some cases greater than, Spider-Man's.\n\n'''''Spider-Man (Peter Parker):''''' While not the symbiote's first host or even its first human host, Peter Parker nevertheless had the most profound impact on the symbiote and its powerset. In addition to augmenting Peter's physical abilities when bonded to him, the symbiote interfaced with his genetic code and imprinted most of his powers into itself.{{r|Venom Vol 3 1}} The symbiote retained these copied powers even after separating from Peter, and bestowed them on its subsequent hosts.\n* '''Body Storage:''' Peter Parker was able to use the symbiote to store his camera and rolls of film.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 252}} Flash often utilized the symbiote to withhold and store munitions and equipment through dimensional apertures within the suit. Wherein he could store foreign objects while keeping a sleek, aerodynamic profile.{{r|Venom Vol 2 33}} Having used this quality to store a live grenade within his body while keeping it from exploding.{{r|Venom Vol 2 1}}\n* '''Camouflage Capabilities:''' The symbiote is capable of shapeshifting to mimic the appearance of any form of clothing, can camouflage with its surroundings to appear invisible, and can even mimic the appearance of other people. Peter Parker only used the former ability during the brief period he was bonded to it, while Brock's preferred form of clothing was a black shirt, jacket and pants.\n* '''Constituent-Matter Generation:''' The symbiote can use the living abyss comprising its matter to generate tendrils and pseudopods, and can use this for lethal effect against criminals. While Spider-Man was unaware it possessed this ability and did not consciously use it, Eddie Brock and its subsequent hosts would often use this ability offensively, such as by sending a part of the symbiote into a victim's body to smother them from the inside.{{r|Venom: Lethal Protector Vol 1 1}}\n* '''Parasitic Inheritance:''' The symbiote can copy the powers and abilities of other beings by interfacing with their genetic code, and primarily utilizes the spider powers it adapted from Spider-Man.{{Citation}}\n* '''Wall-Crawling:''' The alien costume replicated Spider-Man\u2019s ability to cling to walls by controlling the flux of inter-atomic attraction between molecular boundary layers.{{Citation}}\n* '''Webbing Generation:''' The symbiote can convert its constituent matter into strands of white or black webbing, which it can shoot from the white patches on the back of its hands at high pressure up to a distance of 70 feet. The alien\u2019s substance seems to be composed of tough, flexible fibers of organic polymers, which regenerate swiftly after \"shedding.\" The strands have extraordinary adhesive properties, which diminish rapidly once they abandon their living source. After about three hours, with no source to nourish them, the strands dry up like dead skin and dissolve into a powder. The strands possess a tensile strength of 125 pounds per square millimetre of cross-section. The one limitation to this ability was used to Spider-Man's advantage during his second bout with Venom: Since the webbing itself is comprised of the symbiote's constituent matter, if Venom generates too much he will be left vulnerable as the symbiote is weakened and unable to replenish its lost mass for a short period of time.{{Citation}}\n\n'''''Venom (Eddie Brock):''''' The third human individual to bond with the symbiote was Edward Brock. Naturally, the symbiote chose to endow Eddie with most of the powers Spider-Man had, but via Brock's innovative mentality the symbiote has managed to create some new powers and even mutate over time.{{Citation}} After Knull attempted to assimilate the Venom symbiote into the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]], its abilities were augmented and it acquired new powers while connected to Knull's hive-mind.{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}} After being reborn through the living abyss of a [[Symbiote Dragons|symbiote-dragon]] and Eddie becoming the new God of the Symbiotes after vanquishing Knull, the Venom symbiote's powers have been augmented to an unknown degree.{{r|Venom Vol 4 34}}{{r|King in Black Vol 1 5}}\n* '''Superhuman Strength:''' Before he came into contact with the costume, Brock had conditioned himself to lift (press) 700 lb.{{r|Spider-Man: Brand New Day Yearbook Vol 1 1}} Once they merged, the costume added Spider-Man\u2019s superhuman strength to Brock\u2019s vast human strength, making him more powerful than Spider-Man. However, his full strength often fluctuates. Venom has demonstrated strength ranging from only slightly greater than Spider-Man's to being capable of trading blows with high-powered individuals such as [[Cain Marko (Earth-616)|Juggernaut]]. This is caused by the several mutations that the symbiote took with Brock, gaining additional bulk and muscle mass over long periods of time with its host.{{Citation}}\n* '''Superhuman Durability:''' Venom's body is highly resistant to physical injury, capable of withstanding assault from high-caliber bullets as well as attacks from super powered individuals. When distributed at a typical thickness over Brock's body, the symbiote is capable of absorbing bullets from small-arms weapons firing conventional ammunition. The symbiote is however particularly vulnerable to both sonic and heat-based attacks.{{Citation}}\n* '''Superhuman Stamina:''' Venom is also capable of surviving in harmful areas for long periods of time such as underwater or in toxic gases, the symbiote filtering breathable air to the host.{{Citation}} \n* '''Regenerative Healing Factor:''' Additionally, the symbiote is capable of healing injuries in the host at a faster rate than normal human healing allows. The symbiote is also capable of healing injuries and illnesses that current human medical care cannot such as cancer. The symbiote has enabled its host to recover from injuries that should have been lethal, such as Mac Gargan being impaled by the [[Jacques Duquesne (Earth-616)|Swordsman]]'s Makluan Sword;{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 1 119|120}} and Flash Thompson being impaled by [[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Toxin]]'s blade-arm,{{r|Venom Vol 2 32}} and having his head sliced in half by [[Jack O'Lantern (Crime-Master's) (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern V]]'s scythe.{{r|Venom Vol 2 38}}\n* '''Genetic Memory:''' The symbiote possesses some psychic ability, making it capable of obtaining information from its hosts and even other people and symbiotes simply by touch; The symbiote is capable of recalling information from previous hosts. This ability allowed Eddie Brock to know the secret identity of Spider-Man when the symbiote bonded with him. It can however, be forced to forget information if the symbiote is inflicted with heavy trauma.{{Citation}}\n* '''Offspring Detection:''' The symbiote is also capable of psychically detecting its offspring, however with effort this ability can be blocked.{{Citation}}\n* '''Body Chemistry Manipulation:''' In order to gaslight Eddie into believing he had terminal cancer, the Venom symbiote altered his biochemistry to simulate the symptoms.{{r|Venom Vol 4 11}} After being temporarily reconnected to Knull's hive mind, the symbiote gained the ability to directly affect the neurochemical functions within its host in order to induce various psychological effects, such as calmness, sleep, or even memory suppression.{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}}\n* '''Telepathy:''' the Symbiotes species communicate both psionically and biochemically with the host and each other. Their powers of the mind initially start out as weak without a host to bond to.{{Citation}} Venom's years fused to Eddie Brock had more than strengthened its lingering psychic powers to the point its screams of anguish could be felt across all of New York.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Super Special Vol 1 1}} While indwelled by a demon, Agent Venom employed this creatively through his tendrils to seize control of an army of mercenaries.{{r|Venom Vol 2 30}} After coming into contact with Knull, the symbiote displayed the ability to telepathically communicate with other symbiotes.{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}}\n* '''Constituent-Matter Manipulation:''' While the symbiote did not use this ability frequently when bonded to Eddie Brock, it was capable of transforming parts of its host's body: it once morphed Venom's hands into scythe-like hooks and sword-like blades during a battle against [[Richard Rider (Earth-616)|Nova]], and turned his arms into bat-like wings to let him glide.{{r|Nova Vol 3 7}} After being augmented by [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], the symbiote developed the ability to manifest wings resembling those of the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel]] symbiote-dragon in order to fly.{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}} Venom could also project its biomass into a multi-layered shield to better withstand powerful attacks.{{r|Venom: The Mace Vol 1 2}} When bonded to Mac Gargan, it used this ability to grow a tail, emulating Gargan's appearance as the Scorpion.{{r|Beyond! Vol 1 1}} When bonded to Flash Thompson, the symbiote regularly displayed the ability to morph sections of Agent Venom's body, such as his hands or feet, into spikes, blades, axes or a shield.{{Citation}}\n* '''Digital Immersion:''' In a battle with its offspring Carnage, the Venom symbiote and its host displayed the ability to physically enter into the Internet on a \u201cmolecular level\u201d and travel between hard-wired computers through Ethernet cables.{{r|Venom: Carnage Unleashed Vol 1 4}}\n* '''ESP:''' Although the Venom symbiote does not possess a spider-sense,{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 346}} it possesses a similar extrasensory ability. This response is not as complicated as Spider-Man\u2019s inherent sense since the alien costume can detect danger from every direction and conduct Brock in plenty of time. It's a lot more efficient than Spider-Man\u2019s spider-sense because it takes less time to sense the danger, and Brock\u2019s reflexes are faster than Spider-Man\u2019s, even when they are enhanced by the alien costume for instance, Venom can dodge a gunshot or a barrage of bullets.{{citation}}\n* '''Empathetic Empowerment:''' The Venom symbiote, like others of its kind, is capable of feeding off its host's negative emotions - chiefly rage, hatred, and bloodlust - in order to augment itself. However, doing so has a corrupting effect on the symbiote, causing it to become increasingly bloodthirsty, cruel, and feral.{{r|Marvel Knights: Spider-Man Vol 1 8}}{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 8}}{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 10}} \n* '''Symbiote Assimilation:''' In a similar manner to how the [[Hybrid (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Hybrid symbiote]] was formed, Venom is capable of amalgamating with other symbiotes in order to bolster their shared power. It merged with [[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|its clone]], increasing its strength by an unknown degree;{{r|Venom Vol 1 18}} and amalgamated with [[Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Rex Strickland's symbiote]] in order to become powerful enough to face Knull and the Grendel symbiote.{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}}\n* '''Immunity to Spider-Man's Spider-Sense:''' Due to Spider-Man being a host to the symbiote, Venom, and his offspring, are able to bypass Spider-Man's spider-sense. Venom is capable of attacking Spider-Man without alerting him, making Venom a deadly foe. It should be noted that as [[Benjamin Reilly (Earth-616)|Ben Reilly]] was cloned from Peter before he bonded with Venom, Eddie ''was not immune'' to his spider-sense.{{Citation}}\n* '''Poisonous Fangs:''' An ability developed by Eddie Brock upon bonding with the symbiote. Originally he commanded the symbiote to sprout a maniacal grin and tongue, differentiating him from Spider-Man. Later it was revealed that this set of fangs not only intimidates foes but can deliver a powerful, venomous bite (true to Brock's namesake). This bite was able to cripple the [[William Baker (Earth-616)|Sandman]], eventually leaving the villain-turned-hero unable to reform himself properly and almost causing his death.{{r|Spider-Man The Ultimate Guide Vol 1 1}}\n* '''Stretching and deforming:''' Although it's widely known that the symbiote can stretch and deform itself, recently it was able to perform this ability while bonded with a human host. Venom can expand to any size as long as they have something to grow on such as a host or an object. Symbiotes can get inside of small areas such as electric wires and the insides of cars and completely disable them.{{Citation}} \n* '''Telepathy Resistance:''' As a result of Venom being a bond between two separate minds, it takes longer than conventional for a telepath to affect its mind. This defense is not absolute, however.{{r|X-Men: Blue Annual #1}} Additionally, attempting to telepathically incapacitate Venom by targeting the host does not prevent the symbiote from fighting back.{{r|Deadpool: Back in Black Vol 1 5}}\n*'''Energy Absorption & Transference:''' After connecting to the Symbiote Hive-Mind of [[Earth-1051]], the symbiote displayed the power to channel energy and fire it back at the opponent by morphing its arms into energy cannons, similar to [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-23203)|its Earth-23203 counterpart]].{{r|Venom Vol 4 27}} However, once it disconnected from Earth-1051's hive-mind it lost this ability.{{r|Venom Vol 4 30}}\n\n\n'''''Malekith:''''' After capturing the Venom symbiote,{{r|War of the Realms Strikeforce: The War Avengers Vol 1 1}} the dark elf warlord [[Malekith (Earth-616)|Malekith]] bent it to his will using dark magic and the arcane ambiance of [[Stonehenge (Location)|Stonehenge]] in England, bonding with it to increase his own combat prowess.{{r|{{cl|War of the Realms Vol 1 3}}-[[War of the Realms Vol 1 4|4]]}} \n* '''Symbiotic Expansion and Psychic Control:''' Through Venom, Malekith could extend his symbiote to others and interlink them to his own being. Wielding his warriors like a puppet armed force which he could further guide and enhance with symbiote like abilities of they're own.{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 6}} \n* '''Constituent-Matter Manipulation:''' Like many users of the symbiote species, Malekith can conjure and utilize symbiote biomass in order to create his own colorful arsenal physiological extremities. The likes of razor-sharp or blunt-force melee weaponry, large batlike wings to fly with, or simply transforming the symbiote itself into a metamorphic blade.{{r|{{cl|War of the Realms Vol 1 5}}-[[War of the Realms Vol 1 6|6]]}}\n* '''Dark Magic Enhancement:''' Through his connection with one of Knull's creations, Malekith found that his own arcane abilities were greatly enhanced many times over, making both him and the Symbiotes he'd bonded to powerful enough to trade blows with four iterations of the God of Thunder single handed.{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 6}}\n* '''Stretching and deforming:''' To a limited extent Malekith could utilize the amorphous properties of the Venom Symbiote to further enhance himself; having used it elongate his tongue into a lethal razor whip he can fight with.{{r|War of the Realms Vol 1 6}} \n\n'''''Agent Venom (Flash Thompson):''''' After the US military bonded the symbiote to Flash Thompson as the fourth host of the symbiote, it displayed all of the above abilities as well as developing a few new ones as a result of being connected to the Symbiotes hive mind.\n* '''Hive Mind:''' After being purged of its bloodlust, the symbiote gained access to the Symbiotes hive mind, enabling it to communicate with the symbiotes on their homeworld and access information about the species' past.{{r|Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 23}}\n* '''Cosmos Communion:''' As a cleansed Klyntar, the Venom symbiote is able to hear the \"voice\" of the Cosmos telling it of people in need of assistance.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 2}}\n* '''Humanoid Form:''' Since being cleansed, the symbiote has developed the ability to take on a humanoid form independently of being bonded to its host, for a maximum duration of twelve Earth hours.{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 4}} After coming into contact with [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], this ability was augmented to enable it to disguise itself as a human.{{r|Venom Vol 4 12}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1108591764221370368|title=DONNY CATES on Twitter: \"New powers from contact with Knull.\"|work=Twitter|first=Donny|last=Cates|date=20 March 2019|accessdate=9 April 2019}}}}\n* '''Proximity Tracking:''' Agent Venom can track others by leaving pieces of itself on others, seeking them out wherever they may go.{{r|Thunderbolts Vol 2 18}}\n* '''Self-Sustenance:''' The Venom Symbiote enables the host to survive anywhere in any hostile environment. Be it in the cold reaches of space,{{r|Venom: Space Knight Vol 1 4}} or fatally gaseous areas with relative ease.{{r|Venom Vol 2 28}} Flash could even impart this a hazardous element filtration system to others.{{r|Venom Vol 2 38}} \n* '''Morphomerge:''' One time while on mission Flash symbiotically bonded the Symbiotes into a stripped and broken-down car in order to make it operational again. Said vehicle was not only greatly reinforced by its constituent matter; but had the appearance, tentacles and biting maw normally reminiscent of its feral state.{{r|Venom Vol 2 36}} [[Tel-Kar (Earth-616)|Tel-Kar]] was also able to use it to interface with his spaceship.{{r|Venom: First Host Vol 1 3}}\n| Abilities               = \n| Strength                = The symbiote has enabled its hosts to lift up to 70 tons at regular size in the past, this was not their true limit as their strength increases with their variable muscle mass.

When manifested into a humanoid form or bonded to a host, it uses organic webbing formed from its constituent matter to web-swing, emulating Spider-Man. After being briefly reconnected to [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]]'s hive-mind, the symbiote learned how to manifest [[Symbiote Dragons|symbiote dragon]] wings to fly.{{r|Venom Vol 4 5}}{{r|Absolute Carnage Vol 1 2}}\n| Weapons                 = The Venom symbiote can manifest fangs, claws, blades, and tendrils from its constituent living abyss.

Dylan had asked the symbiote about its name since Venom's name is a union of the host with it, revealing that it does not have a name as such but to differentiate itself from the symbiotes it uses emotional patterns.{{r|Venom Vol 4 35}}\n* A notable aspect of the Venom symbiote in its portrayal in the show ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', the comic series ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man Vol 1|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' and the film ''[[Spider-Man 3 (film)|Spider-Man 3]]'' is that it caused its host to bring out their most aggressive and violent side. In the comics, this aspect of the symbiote originally didn't exist, but has been retconned into the comics by some writers.\n* The symbiote shares similar aspects with the [[w:c:avp:Xenomorph XX121 (Alien)|Xenomorph]] from the cinematic franchise [[w:c:avp:Alien (franchise)|''Alien'']]. Both species require a host, are able to walk on walls, and it can become increasingly powerful depending on their host.

As he gets up and looks out the window at the nighttime cityscape, a manifestation of the Venom symbiote appears on his shoulder, urging him to go out and drink in the moonlight. As Venom web-swings over the city, the symbiote points out a robbery being committed by a group of men wearing armor with colored pauldrons and urges Eddie to stop them.\n\nThe armored thieves attach a bomb to the door of a building and detonate it. The purple-armored thief enters the building as the others go over their plan. Venom lands in their midst, causing the thief in red armor to flee in terror as the others pull out taser weapons. Unaffected, Venom grabs the blue-armored thief by the throat and demands to know why a bunch of terrorists would rob a biotech firm, guessing they're after a biological weapon. The blue-armored thief explains that they're not terrorists, but a technology group and that their tech is non-lethal. Venom demands to know who hired them, but the purple-armored thief returns with the item they were after, stopping abruptly as he spots Venom. Venom web-slings the blue-armored thief into a wall, killing him, as the yellow-armored thief gets up and attacks him. Venom tackles him to the ground, destroys his taser, and demands to be given what the purple-armored thief stole. Terrified, the thief turns over a genetically-modified tomato in a canister. Venom is dumbfounded, protesting that he thought he was stopping terrorists. As the police arrive, Venom flees and lands on a rooftop. Retracting the symbiote, Eddie demands to know what happened and why it lashed out with violence. The symbiote retorts that the thieves were little men who were taking something that didn't belong to them and needed to be put in their place, but Eddie snaps that they weren't hurting anyone. The symbiote protests that the men were thieves, asking Eddie if this isn't what he wanted, and Eddie retorts that they don't butcher men for being thieves, wondering aloud what he was thinking. The symbiote responds that he wants to be a hero and can't be seen looking stupid.\n\nTravelling to the run-down Our Lady of Saints Church, Eddie sits in one of the pews as the symbiote observes this is where they first met and asks if he's sad. As Eddie responds that he isn't, a pair of young street thugs enter and confront Eddie, pulling out weapons. Standing up, Eddie menacingly tells them to leave him alone, the symbiote covering one hand behind his back, and the thugs lose their nerve and flee. A voice thanks Eddie for scaring them off and that the diocese asked him to restore the parish, a task made difficult by the increase in criminal activity. Eddie turns to see a priest, who notes that he's a dangerous man and asks if he's come for benediction. Eddie responds that he doesn't believe in God anymore, but the priest smiles and says that Eddie still came to God's house. Sitting next to Eddie, the priest states that when Galactus first attacked Earth and battled the Fantastic Four, almost all of his parishioners stopped coming to church after years of flawless attendance, but people who had never been to church in their lives started attending. Eddie pensively tells the priest that he recently resumed a relationship, and when asked by the priest if that's a good thing he responds that he'd been dreaming of it for years. The priest notes that Eddie's implying that it's not as he'd hoped, and Eddie states that he went through a lot of pain to get this relationship back, but that as a result he did something he thought he would never do again, and that he thought he'd put those days behind him. The priest asks if his partner was the one who made him do something he regrets and if Eddie regrets the reunion, but Eddie firmly denies this, saying that he will never regret this reunion but that he doesn't know who he and his partner are together anymore. The priest comforts Eddie, saying that if his partner loves him they wouldn't force him to do something he doesn't want to do, causing the symbiote to tell Eddie it doesn't like the priest. Eddie snaps that the priest doesn't know what he's talking about, but the priest warns him that he knows obsession when he sees it, and that if love is used to justify pain it turns into something ugly. As the symbiote reiterates its dislike of the priest, Eddie stands up, saying he has to leave, and the priest tells Eddie to come back whenever he feels the need to talk.\n\nWalking down the street, the symbiote states that it only wants what Eddie wants, what they both want: to be together forever. As Eddie agrees with this, the symbiote states it will hurt anyone who threatens their bond, and Eddie tells it that no-one is threatening them, expressing concern over its behavior. The symbiote acknowledges it is succumbing to rage and hatred again, and that some days it's stronger than others, but that even in its weakened state it's more than capable of killing anyone who interferes. A bright light shines behind Eddie and the symbiote warns him of an incoming attack, not fast enough to avoid being attacked by the Scorpion. Mac Gargan sneers that he'd heard from his people at Alchemax that Eddie was Venom again, and that he has unfinished business with both Eddie and the Venom symbiote. Transforming into Venom, Eddie snarls that it's time to finish their grudge match, and lunges. Venom's claws spark off Gargan's armor as the Scorpion's tail shoots a torrent of flame at him. Venom grabs the tail and crushes it, but Gargan uses the distraction to blast Venom point-blank with sonic weapons mounted in his pincers. Gargan taunts Eddie as the symbiote sloughs away, saying that he had Alchemax modify his armor to pinpoint the frequency that causes the symbiote the most amount of pain, and that he still has nightmares of when he was bonded to it. As Gargan expresses his intent to crush Eddie's head and burn the symbiote to cinders, Eddie realizes that Gargan fears the symbiote and urges it to exploit this. The symbiote enters Gargan's suit and he immediately jettisons the Scorpion armor, terrified that it wants to bond with him again. Eddie sneers that the symbiote would never leave him for the likes of Gargan before punching him out and collapsing, exhausted from Gargan's beatdown. The symbiote envelops him and carries him to safety as he passes out, saying that it will always take care of him and won't let anyone get between them.\n\nEddie regains consciousness in Our Lady of Saints Church, asking the symbiote what happened and where they are. It responds that they're back where they first bonded, comparing their relationship to marriage, and when asked why it brought him there the symbiote responds that the church is a special place where they were bonded forever, and that no-one will break that bond. Looking around, Eddie is horrified to see the seemingly dead body of the priest nearby and that his hands are covered in blood, asking the symbiote what it's done. As Eddie sorrowfully cradles the priest's body in his arms, the symbiote ominously responds that ''they'' did what they will do to anyone who tries to come between them.\n\n| StoryTitle2         = Dependence Day\n| Writer2_1           = Robbie Thompson\n| Penciler2_1         = Gerardo Sandoval\n| Inker2_1            = Gerardo Sandoval\n| Colorist2_1         = Dono S\u00e1nchez-Almara\n| Letterer2_1         = Clayton Cowles\n| Editor2_1           = Devin Lewis\n| Editor2_2           = Allison Stock\n| Editor2_3           = Nick Lowe\n\n| Appearing2          = \n'''Featured Characters:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Venom (Flash Thompson)]]}} {{g|Loses the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom Symbiote]]}}\n'''Supporting Characters:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Andrea Benton (Earth-616)|Mania (Andi Benton)]]}}\n'''Antagonists:'''\n* [[Demons]] {{FlashOnly}}\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Federal Bureau of Investigation (Earth-616)|FBI]]}}\n** {{1stChron|[[Agent Wambaugh (Earth-616)|Agent Wambaugh]]}} {{FlashOnly}}\n** {{Voice|[[Coyle Bagman (Earth-616)|Agent Coyle Bagman]]}} {{1stChron}} {{FlashOnly}}\n'''Other Characters:'''\n* Andi's mother {{Mentioned}} {{FlashOnly}}\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Alcoholics Anonymous (Earth-616)|Alcoholics Anonymous]]}}\n* Unnamed homeless man {{RecapOnly}} {{g|Bonds with the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom Symbiote]]}}\n'''Races and Species:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Symbiotes (Race)|Symbiotes]]}}\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Homo sapiens|Humans]]}}\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Demons]]}}\n'''Locations:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Earth]]}}\n** {{FlashOnly|[[United States of America]]}}\n*** {{FlashOnly|[[New York (State)|New York]]}}\n**** {{FlashOnly|[[New York City]]}}\n***** {{FlashOnly|[[Manhattan]]}}\n'''Items:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom Symbiote]]}}\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Mania (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Mania Symbiote]]}}\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Hell-Mark]]}}\n* Flash's prosthetic legs {{FlashOnly}}\n* FBI's anti-symbiote suit {{g|Only appearance; destruction}} {{FlashOnly}}\n<!-- '''Vehicles:'''\n* <br/> -->\n\n| Synopsis2           = Several weeks prior to the symbiote's reunion with Eddie, Agent Venom and Mania prowl the alleys of New York, dispatching a group of lower demons. Taking a break to eat pizza after the battle, Flash banters with Andi, all the while being spied on by the FBI, who want to reclaim the symbiote. As Andi departs to do her homework, Flash transforms into Agent Venom and tells his pursuers that he knows they've been tailing him all night and they're alone now. Turning, he sees a person clad in a bulky suit of powered armor, but is cut off in the middle of a quip when the armored figure blasts him point-blank with a flamethrower. Transforming into his monstrous form, Venom snarls that all they've done is made him angry, asking if it was his opponent's plan to get beaten down. The armored figure responds that his plan was to lure Venom in close before blasting him with a weapon that separates the symbiote from Flash and sends it into a berserk state. Flash tries to calm the symbiote down, but it assumes its humanoid form and flees. The armored figure mocks Flash, saying he's not so tough without his friend, but Flash angrily kicks him over before running off to find the Venom symbiote. Removing his helmet, Agent Wambaugh tells his superiors that the symbiote has been separated from its host and is in the open.\n\nTogether, Flash and Andi search for the Venom symbiote, using the Mania symbiote to track it down. Unsuccessful, Flash reluctantly gives up, and it is revealed he was summarizing what had happened to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.\n\nElsewhere, the Venom symbiote comes to its senses but is still consumed with rage, ashamed that the anger embroiling it feels good. Weakened from a prolonged period without a host and struggling to suppress its feral urges, the symbiote falls off the roof of an apartment into an alley, where it encounters an elderly homeless man and takes over him.\n\n| StoryTitle3         = Malled!\n| Writer3_1           = David Michelinie\n| Penciler3_1         = Ron Lim\n| Inker3_1            = John Livesay\n| Colorist3_1         = Lee Loughridge\n| Letterer3_1         = Clayton Cowles\n| Editor3_1           = Devin Lewis\n| Editor3_2           = Allison Stock\n| Editor3_3           = Nick Lowe\n\n| Appearing3          = \n'''Featured Characters:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Venom (Eddie Brock)]]}}\n<!-- '''Supporting Characters:'''\n* <br/> -->\n'''Antagonists:'''\n* Unidentified gang members {{g|Only appearance; death}} {{FlashOnly}}\n* Unnamed mall security guard {{Only Dies}} {{FlashOnly}}\n'''Other Characters:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[New York City Police Department (Earth-616)|NYPD]]}}\n* {{Mentioned|[[Daily Globe (Earth-616)|Daily Globe]]}} {{FlashOnly}}\n* {{Mentioned|[[Judas Iscariot (Earth-616)|Judas Iscariot]]}} {{FlashOnly}}\n'''Races and Species:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Symbiotes (Race)|Symbiotes]]}}\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Homo sapiens|Humans]]}}\n'''Locations:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Earth]]}}\n** {{FlashOnly|[[United States of America]]}}\n*** {{FlashOnly|[[New York (State)|New York]]}}\n**** {{FlashOnly|[[New York City]]}}\n***** {{FlashOnly|[[Queens]]}}\n****** Strickland Mall {{Only}} {{FlashOnly}}\n'''Items:'''\n* {{FlashOnly|[[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom Symbiote]]}}\n* {{Minor|[[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man (Peter Parker)]]}} in {{Toy|[[Spider-Man's Suit]]}}\n<!-- '''Vehicles:'''\n* <br/> -->\n\n| Synopsis3           = Years ago in the Strickland Mall, Queens, Venom rips the head off a Spider-Man action figure and tosses it next to the dozens of others he's decapitated. Retracting the symbiote, Eddie laments that stakeouts are boring before saying that tedium is a small price to pay for revenge on Spider-Man for ruining his career and rejecting the symbiote. Walking through the mall, Eddie notes that a gang of criminals has been robbing shoppers, and that he intends to use the investigative skills he honed as a reporter to do what the police cannot and hunt them down. An alarm interrupts his monologue, and three armed men enter. Transforming, Venom perches on a wall and decides to wait for Spider-Man to arrive so that he can ambush him, but one of the thugs pulls a gun on a mall security guard for tripping the alarm. Before he can shoot, Venom snares his hand with a tendril and throws him out the window. One of the other thugs opens fire to no effect, and Venom quips at him while plugging the barrel with a tendril, causing it to explode.\n\nHiding behind a wall, the last remaining thug looks around for Venom, who emerges out of invisibility behind him and grabs him by the neck, quoting a Bible verse before snapping his neck. Returning to the security guard, Venom asks if he is alright, but the terrified man opens fire. Ejecting the bullets, Venom is confused by his reaction, but as he approaches the security guard grabs a woman and offers her to Venom in exchange for his life. Unamused, Venom notes that the security guard was entrusted with the lives of the people around him, asking if this is how he honors that responsibility. Irately noting he gave up revenge on Spider-Man to save the security guard, Venom smothers him with a tendril, proclaiming him to not be innocent. The woman he saved calls him a monster, but Venom mistakenly believes she's talking about the security guard and says he won't harm her anymore.\n\nAs the police arrive, Eddie Brock once again laments the misfortune and betrayal that befell him and the symbiote, before cheering up when the symbiote voicelessly tells him that betrayal makes them stronger by feeding their rage. With renewed determination and enthusiasm, Eddie transforms into Venom and web-swings into the night.\n\n| Solicit             = REUNITED, AND IT FEELS SO GOOD!\n \nOr, feels so bad?

She tries to warn them, but is interrupted when Devil Dinosaur bursts from the sewer entrance, scaring the workers into fleeing. Moon Girl tries to calm Devil down, saying that people could get hurt, but he tries to eat her. Venom grabs her at the last second, scolding her for not listening when he told her not to bring her dinosaur into the sewers. Stegron stops Devil Dinosaur from chasing them, saying it is not yet time to unveil themselves, but that when it is Devil Dinosaur will be his steed.\n\nAs Moon Girl yells at him to go back to save Devil Dinosaur, Venom deposits her on the roof of an apartment and reminds her that her friend tried to eat her. Saying that this has gotten too big for the two of them, Venom considers putting in an anonymous call to the Avengers and stealing the symbiote's medicine from Alchemax, but Moon Girl interrupts and says that if he calls the Avengers they'll hurt Devil Dinosaur or take him away. As she storms off, Venom tells her that Stegron can control dinosaurs, meaning that Devil isn't her friend anymore, but she snaps at him that if he's not in control of his actions then he's still her friend and must be fighting what's happening. Mulling over the new information, she theorizes that she might be able to create a transmitter to block Stegron's telepathic control, but Venom reminds her that Stegron won't wait for them to build something to stop him from dumping his dinosaur serum into New York's water mains. Moon Girl says that just means they need to come up with an immediate solution, but asks Venom to not hurt Devil Dinosaur, reminding Eddie of the symbiote's plight when she asks if he wouldn't do everything he could if he had a friend who was in trouble. The symbiote says it knows how to break Stegron's control of Devil Dinosaur, but Eddie hesitates. Looking down at Moon Girl crying, he reluctantly agrees to the symbiote's plan. Overjoyed, Moon Girl hitches a ride on Venom's back as they web-swing to Stegron's lair.\n\nElsewhere, Stegron prepares to hook up massive vats of his dinosaur serum to New York's water supply, scolding his minions and Devil Dinosaur for not being more careful. When Devil Dinosaur smells something, Stegron yells at him for becoming distracted, not noticing Venom emerging out of invisibility behind him. Venom tackles Stegron from behind, but he orders his minions to continue setting up his plan. Devil Dinosaur roars and lunges at Venom, and Stegron sneers that he must have forgotten that the beast is under his control and has no qualms about biting him in half. Inside Devil Dinosaur's mouth, Venom says they were counting on that, the symbiote forcing Devil's mouth open so that Venom can escape and then wrapping around his head. As the symbiote flows off of him and covers Devil Dinosaur's head, Eddie internally remarks that this plan had better work. The symbiote responds that it can be a hero and save them all. Bonding to both Eddie and Devil Dinosaur simultaneously, the symbiote severs Stegron's control. As Stegron demands to know what's happening, Eddie tells him that the symbiote connects to its host's brain stem and that Stegron's telepathy has nothing on that. As Stegron counters that he still has his slaves, Moon Girl drops crystals into the vats of Stegron's serum. Stegron orders his slaves to buy him time while he pours the serum into the water, but Moon Girl reveals she altered the temperature of the vats to render the serum inert and added a slow-release potassium capsule for good measure. The vats explode, knocking her to the ground, and a livid Stegron lunges at her, snarling that she stole his future from her and he will make her future one of agony. The symbiote notes it's hard to control Devil Dinosaur, but Eddie tells it to focus and help Moon Girl. Lashing out with Devil Dinosaur's claws and tail, the symbiote devours several dinosaur men but notes there are too many. Eddie is slashed across the back by a pterosaur hybrid, causing the symbiote to lapse into a feral rage. Eddie immediately pulls it off Devil Dinosaur, lamenting that he knew the idea was a bad one from the start.\n\nAs Moon Girl stays just outside of Stegron's reach, Venom snarks that short forearms are a classic dinosaur problem. Turning to see Venom holding a wrench, Stegron asks Venom if he honestly thinks he can hurt him with the human tool or if he was planning on escaping through the waterworks again. Venom retorts that he was thinking that Stegron has to weigh between 1200 and 1500 pounds, and Stegron says all of that bulk is muscle, scale, and horn \u2014 making Venom no match for him in a fight. Venom agrees, then asks if Stegron can swim as he uses the wrench to bash the valve off a water tank, the resulting torrent blasting Stegron into the reservoir. Venom fishes him out and webs him up, Moon Girl scolding him for almost letting Stegron drown. Venom retorts that he should have, since Stegron could wake up at any moment and seize control of his minions again. Moon Girl replies that all they have to do is knock him out again, and that the dinosaur people don't want to be Stegron's slaves in the first place. An ankylosaur hybrid agrees, and Venom asks what they'll do without Stegron. The ankylosaur hybrid says that those who volunteered for the transformation help those who didn't have a say to adjust to their new forms, and that without Stegron they aren't a threat to anyone, and intent to work on a cure for those who wish to return to human form. Venom remarks that the dinosaur people have found a new god to worship in Devil Dinosaur, but Moon Girl vetoes that, saying that Devil sticks with her and she is not setting up shop in the sewers. She points out that the dinosaur people just want to be left in peace and need a protector, and Venom realizes she's talking about him.\n\nAt Alchemax, Dr. Steven and Liz Allan present Eddie Brock with a package of syringes containing a month's supply of medication for the symbiote. Dr. Steven tells him that the symbiote shouldn't devolve any further if he sticks to the prescribed dosage, though he says that blood serums are difficult and that he wants to monitor Eddie for the first few days to make sure it works. Eddie thanks them, but says that rather than a doctor's appointment he could do with a job. Liz refuses, saying that while she's happy to provide him with the medication needed to prevent him from becoming a homicidal monster, Eddie is a wanted man and that Alchemax is under enough scrutiny as-is without a federal fugitive on the payroll. Eddie asks what he'll do to make a living, saying that his assets from his stint with the FBI have been frozen, and Liz suggests he steal from the criminals he beats up, asking what happened to the dinosaur army he'd mentioned. Eddie lies and says he overestimated the amount, that the ones who survived fled into the sewers, and that without Stegron they're harmless. Liz hints she knows he's lying, remarking that he should get paid for telling stories in a dig at the Sin Eater debacle.\n\nLater, Eddie \u2014 clad in a black trench coat, shirt, and pants \u2014 walks down the street as the symbiote jubilantly proclaims they did it. He asks what it was they did to make it so happy, pointing out they're broke and saddled with protecting an underground city of dinosaur people who'll inevitably cause them trouble. The symbiote proclaims that they're heroes and succeeded in helping Liz Allan and getting it the medicine, and in working alongside other heroes to protect people. Spotting a tabloid magazine proclaiming the Skrull Invasion to have been a governmet hoax, Eddie wryly smiles and admits that maybe the symbiote is right and things are looking up after all.\n\n| Solicit             = \u201cTHE LAND BEFORE CRIME\u201d CONCLUDES!\n\n\u2022 Eddie Brock and the Venom symbiote are having a tough time sticking together, biologically speaking.

Thinking he's talking to her, [[Claire Dixon (Earth-616)|Agent Claire Dixon]] retorts that they were in [[Anti-Symbiote Task Force (Earth-616)|a military unit]], not a marriage; and that he should know what happens when a soldier goes rogue. The symbiote apologizes and tells Eddie it was scared; and he retorts that he can't believe it didn't just tell him. Dixon replies that while he was part of the task force he didn't have the clearance and after he went AWOL he didn't leave a forwarding address. The symbiote tells Eddie it had hoped he'd be able to feel it, and he bitterly replies that he never felt anything. Claire realizes he's talking to his symbiote and that he didn't know it was going to spawn, asking Eddie if that doesn't make him worried it's keeping other secrets. The symbiote protests that it's not, and that it didn't tell him because it was afraid its spawn would end up being corrupted into a monster like its others were. Eddie angrily tells Claire not to talk as though she knows him, and she retorts that she knows symbiotes on account of having been bonded to [[Raze (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|one]] herself. When she admits to having died on the [[Chthonic Island]], Eddie asks how she's able to stand there talking to him before speculating that the [[Darkhold]]'s eldritch magic resurrected her for some sinister purpose. \n\nBefore Dixon can retort, [[MacDonald Gargan (Earth-616)|Mac Gargan]] interrupts and steps from the shadows, dressed in his original Scorpion outfit. Eddie calls Dixon out on working with a psychopath like Gargan, who retorts that Eddie was threatening to commit cannibalism as Venom while he was just robbing banks. The symbiote panics regarding its spawn's fate if it bonds to Gargan, and Eddie asks Dixon if her deal with the Scorpion was to let him out of prison and give him a symbiote in exchange for following their orders and running experiments on him. Dixon retorts that Gargan has experience with symbiotes from his time as Venom and that he's controllable whereas Eddie left the program. The Scorpion interrupts, preparing to knock Eddie out with his tail, but before he can do so a bolt of green energy rips a hole in the van's roof. Quipping that she heard someone pregnant was being kidnapped, Spider-Woman dodges the Scorpion's return fire and rips the van's back door off. Dixon tells the Scorpion to stand down as Spider-Woman tosses Eddie - still strapped to the gurney - into the street, telling him to get the symbiote to cushion his landing. As he bounces down the street, Eddie confronts the symbiote over having told Spider-Woman but not him; and it replies that it didn't tell her but made her feel like it tried with him. Spider-Woman hits the Scorpion in the face with an energy bolt, but Dixon - eyes glowing yellow and crackling with eldritch energy - headbutts her in the face. Spider-Woman falls out of the van and Claire enters the front to tell the driver to turn around, only for the van to rear-end a stopped taxi and car. Before Spider-Woman can rush to help, Eddie tells her that the people in the van are with the military and that if she sticks around she'll just end up fighting the police and the FBI, and that both of them will go to prison. Lifting the gurney as she climbs a wall, Spider-Woman tells Eddie he's lucky she has a soft spot for unborn babies. Nursing a concussion, Dixon exits the van and watches Spider-Woman escape. The Scorpion rips out of the van, demanding she tell him which way they went. Dixon tells him to stand down and that support is coming, but he shouts that he was promised the symbiote and isn't going to let Eddie take what's his. \n\nOn a rooftop, Eddie discards the shock collar and thanks Spider-Woman, remarking that his symbiote obviously trusts her more than it trusts him. Spider-Woman retorts that the only reason she saved him was because the Venom symbiote showed her that its previous spawn had become monsters. When the symbiote tries to elaborate, Eddie snaps at it to shut up, but Spider-Woman tells him to take it easy on the symbiote and that the only person it trusts to help raise its newest spawn right is him; the symbiote lamentingly telling Eddie it wants its new spawn to be a hero like he is. Transforming into Venom, Eddie prepares to leave. Spider-Woman asks what he's going to do, and Venom replies that Eddie and the symbiote are going to have a long talk, but first they're going to find the person who ratted them out to the government and deal with him; causing her to regret having saved him. \n\nAt Alchemax, Dr. Steve examines a cell culture while singing a song about molecules, only to see \"Hi there\" written in symbiote biomass when he peers into the microscope. Venom complements his singing before threatening to tear his throat out, noting that Dr. Steve is the only person who could have known that the symbiote was pregnant and demanding to know why he told the government instead of him. Dr. Steve stammers that he didn't know the symbiote was pregnant at the time, but that while running some tests after the symbiote's metabolic issue was corrected he noticed something strange and was concerned it was a side-effect of the medication, sending it to a government contact who was experienced with symbiote biology. By the time he realized the Venom symbiote was pregnant, Eddie hadn't come back for weeks and left no way of getting in contact. When Dr. Steve remarks he's insulted Eddie would think he'd betray one of his few friends, Eddie remarks that he needs all the friends he can get because the symbiote's birth is immanent. \n\nOn the bottom floor, Mac Gargan - wearing a trench coat over his Scorpion costume, talks to Hugo - the guard at the front desk. Hugo refuses to admit Gargan, stating that he hasn't worked at Achemax in months and that he'd been in prison. Gargan retorts that he's working for the military and has reason to believe Venom is in the building, but Hugo threatens to call security. Putting on his mask, Gargan extends his tail and remarks they'll have to do things the hard way.\n\nSeated on a chair as the symbiote goes into labor, Eddie wonders why this time is so different from the other times the symbiote gave birth, recalling he hadn't felt anything when it gave birth to [[Carnage (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Carnage]]. Dr. Steve remarks that the symbiote has undergone any number of experiences that could be impacting the birthing process, urging he separate from it before he goes into cardiac arrest. Despite the symbiote's protests, Eddie separates from it saying that he's not going anywhere but that he's no good to it dead. Agreeing, the Scorpion - covered in blood - enters the room, telling Eddie to stand aside and let him claim the symbiote. Eddie tells Dr. Steve to help the symbiote and throws a glass jar at Gargan, smashing him over the head with a microscope before he can recover. The Scorpion sends Eddie flying into a cabinet, stating he hopes Eddie's conscious to watch him kill the Venom symbiote and take its spawn. Eddie struggles to his feet, but before the Scorpion can attack him he's incapacitated by an electric shock. Standing in the doorway, Dixon remarks that she told Eddie that Gargan was controllable. When Eddie challenges her, Dixon remarks that he knows she can take him on and that she's not letting him keep the baby symbiote. Dr. Steve approaches holding a lump of symbiote biomass and informs them that the infant was stillborn; and Dixon sincerely apologizes to Eddie before they both pass out from their injuries. \n\nLater, Liz Allan apologizes to Claire Dixon's superiors and remarks that she's a tough woman, offering any help they may need. Hanging up, she wryly remarks that Eddie is running out of ways to cause her grief. Eddie remarks that at least she got to put Gargan away, but she scolds him that that doesn't make up for him trashing her lab again or making her lie to the government about the Venom symbiote's spawn. As the symbiote gushes over how beautiful its baby is, Liz remarks that she hates it when he and the symbiote have their private conversations in front of her. Eddie tells her he'll be stopping by twice a week to check up on the infant symbiote to spend time with it, and that they're not to bond it to a host without Venom's say-so - and until then they're free to keep it safe and study it non-invasively. As Eddie leaves, Liz wryly remarks that somehow he seems to be the one who comes out the victor; the symbiote remarking that it's changed its mind about her and Dr. Steve; and that it now understands that its family doesn't have to be just it and Eddie.\n\n| Solicit             = THE NATIVITY Part 2\n\n\u2022 As Eddie and the symbiote find themselves less trusting of one another than ever before, a new enemy emerges and threatens to tear the two of them apart... and not just from each other!\n\n\u2022 IN THIS ISSUE: Startling revelations that set the stage for the Venom epic of the fall!\n\n| Notes               = \n| Trivia              = \n| Recommended         = \n| Links               = \n}}\n[[Category:Digital Comic Code included]]"}}}]}, "972525": {"pageid": 972525, "ns": 0, "title": "Venom Vol 3 3", "revisions": [{"slots": {"main": {"contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki", "*": "{{Marvel Database:Comic Template\n| Image1              = Venom Vol 3 3.jpg\n| Image2              = Venom Vol 3 3 Textless.jpg\n| Image2_Text         = Textless\n| Image3              = Venom Vol 3 3 Campbell Variant.jpg\n| Image3_Text         = Campbell Variant\n| Image4              = Venom Vol 3 3 Campbell Variant Textless.jpg \n| Image4_Text         = Campbell Variant Textless\n| Image5              = Venom Vol 3 3 Frankie's Comics Exclusive Variant.jpg\n| Image5_Text         = Frankie's Comics Exclusive Wraparound Variant\n| Image6              = Venom Vol 3 3 Frankie's Comics Exclusive Virgin Variant.jpg \n| Image6_Text         = Frankie's Comics Exclusive Virgin Wraparound Variant\n| Image7              = Venom Vol 3 3 Frankie's Comics Exclusive Black And White Variant.jpg \n| Image7_Text         = Frankie's Comics Exclusive Black and White Wraparound Variant\n| Image8              = Venom Vol 3 3 KRS Comics Black and White Exclusive Variant.jpg\n| Image8_Text         = KRS Comics Exclusive Black and White Variant\n| Image9              = Venom Vol 3 3 KRS Comics Exclusive Variant.jpg\n| Image9_Text         = KRS Comics Exclusive Variant\n| Image10             = Venom Vol 3 3 KRS Comics Exclusive Virgin Variant.jpg \n| Image10_Text        = KRS Comics Exclusive Virgin Variant\n\n\n| Month               = 3\n| Year                = 2017\n| ReleaseDate         = 1-18-2017\n| Rating              = T+\n| OriginalPrice       = $3.99\n\n| Editor-in-Chief     = Axel Alonso\n| Image1_Artist1      = Gerardo Sandoval\n\n| Quotation           = Though we are a benevolent species, there is no literature on [[Klyntar (Location)|my home planet]].

Many of its former hosts were filled with rage and corrupted it into a predatory monster, but two of them -- Spider-Man and Flash Thompson -- showed it there was a better way and taught it to be a hero. Its current host, Lee Price, is less than upstanding in that regard.\n\nIn the present, Price snaps at Agent Wambaugh to get out of his way or die. Wambaugh orders Venom to release the hostage or be shot with his bazooka, and his partner, Agent Bagman, recognizes the Venom symbiote and expresses shock that it is a villain. Taking advantage of the distraction, Firebug blasts Venom with a torrent of flames, causing the symbiote to reel in pain, tossing Firebug through the wall of one of the surrounding apartments. Price orders the symbiote to pull itself together or they'll both die, but it refuses to stay bonded with him. Deciding to bond with one of the FBI agents, it separates from Price, who struggles to keep it bonded to himself. The symbiote grabs Wambaugh and starts to bond with him, but Bagman shoots Price in the chest three times in retaliation. The symbiote tries to calm the panicking Wambaugh, who yells at Bagman to hit it with fire, then notices Price bleeding out nearby. Faced by the hypocrisy of telling Wambaugh it's duty is to save lives and letting even someone as despicable as Price die, the symbiote lets go of Wambaugh and plugs Price's injury, picking him up in its jaws and carrying him away.\n\nAt the Black Cat gang's headquarters, Mac Gargan asks Black Cat if she saved Lee Price's vomit. Disgusted, Black Cat asks him why he'd think she'd do that, and Gargan responds that Price was lying to them. Adams, Black Cat's lieutenant, looks up from reading the newspaper and asks Gargan what he expected to find in Price's vomit. Gargan pulls out photos from the botched arms deal, pointing out that the wounds sustained by the dead gang members aren't from gunshots and that Price lied to them. Black Cat sarcastically responds that if she refused to work with liars she wouldn't have any employees, and that all they know was that there was a superhuman ambush, suggesting that the Kingpin might be responsible. Gargan accuses Price of being responsible, but Black Cat remains skeptical, saying that at worst that would make Price guilty of trying too hard to work for her.\n\nPrice has a vision of Tony, who coldly states that there's not much to say these days since Price murdered him. Eyes glowing red, Tony states that there's something black inside Price, who retorts that it's been there all along and just needed something to set it free, Venom's shadow looming behind him. Waking up in Tony's apartment, Price inquires why the symbiote brought him there, and it states that it saw in his memories that this was the only place he considered to be safe. Price asks it why it saved him when it hates him, and it responds that while it does hate him, it wasn't going to let him die when it's its duty to protect life. Smirking, Price states it didn't seem too concerned with protecting Firebug when it tossed him into the apartments, and the symbiote ashamedly stammers that the fire caused it to lash out. Price tries to reassure it, stating that it's like a dog \u2014 smart when it's calm but acting on instinct when spooked \u2014 and that it ''thinks'' it wants to be a hero, but what it really wants is for someone to be in charge of it. Before the symbiote can respond, Agent Wambaugh kicks the door down and points an assault rifle at Price, who asks how they found him. Wambaugh retorts that it wasn't hard when he's a known associate of a member of Black Cat's gang.\n\nPrice tries to talk his way out of a fight, saying they must be mistaken, but Wambaugh retorts that they got a good look at his face in the alley. Dropping the act, Price coldly states that he could easily kill Wambaugh and that the rifle would be useless, ignoring the symbiote's manifestation saying that it won't let him kill Wambaugh and that in his weakened state it could probably stop him. Price mentally retorts that Wambaugh doesn't know that, just as Wambaugh states that if Price transforms into Venom his partner will open fire using the high-ordinance incendiary bazooka. Looking out the window, Price sees Agent Bagman standing on the roof of an apartment across the street aiming the bazooka at him, and calmly states that Wambaugh would definitely die if that happened, but that might not be enough to kill him. Wambaugh agrees that it might not, but notes that he knows that Price has the Venom symbiote and has taken steps to keep everyone \u2014 including his criminal allies \u2014 from finding out about it, saying the FBI isn't there to arrest him. Price responds that he's listening, and Wambaugh lays down an ultimatum: if Price were to attack, either he dies in the ensuing explosion or Black Cat realizes something is off and comes gunning for Price when she realizes he was playing her, leaving him exposed and hunted by every police agency and superhero on the planet. However, Wambaugh extends the offer of working for the FBI as an informant, appealing to Price's pragmatic nature and saying to meet him in front of Parker Industries at noon the next day. As Wambaugh leaves, the symbiote says it can understand that Price is angry at being forced into action, but expresses eagerness to be working on the side of good again. Price tells it to shut up, asking if it honestly thinks Wambaugh is any better a person than he is just because he carries a badge.\n\nAt Black Cat's headquarters, Adams approaches Gargan and shows him a picture of Price's destroyed apartment, asking if he did that. Gargan sarcastically retorts that it wasn't him, and is surprised when he learns who the apartment belonged to, asking if Price is dead. Adams states that no bodies were recovered, saying he just thought that given his earlier suspicions Gargan had taken matters into his own hands. Gargan rebukes him for thinking he'd go behind Black Cat's back, but Adams says that he understands that Gargan is concerned about something that Black Cat doesn't comprehend. He admits he was wrong about the fire, saying that Gargan is more the type to listen to his gut and do what needs to be done personally, saying that's why Black Cat hired him in the first place as he walks away. Admitting Adams is right about that, Gargan turns and regards the Scorpion armor.\n\n| Solicit             = \u2022 After working as a Guardian of the Galaxy and a Space Knight, all of the Venom

[[Symbiotes (Race)|Black tendrils]] burst through the door and snare the warriors, yanking them through the air into the gaping maw of [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|an enormous beast]], which speaks in an alien language as it devours them.\n\n[[Edward Brock (Earth-616)|Eddie Brock]], viewing these events as a nightmare, is initially confused; not recognizing the place or the language, but feeling like it belongs to him. Abruptly realizing that the dream is not his but [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|his symbiote]]'s, Eddie awakens as a bolt of lightning splits the sky overhead. Sitting up, he notices he is alone before correcting himself that he is never alone, looking to where the Venom symbiote is huddled in the darkness, separated from him. He tries to reassure it that the thunder won't hurt it, but it interrupts and asks if he saw the monster. Eddie replies that he did, noting that he didn't know it even could have nightmares, and the Venom symbiote replies that it didn't know either. As it rebonds to him, the symbiote asks why its mind hurts and if Eddie knows what's wrong with it, but when he tries to reassure it that nothing's wrong - heading into his apartment's bathroom - it snarls that he's lying, demanding to know why he's taking anti-psychosis medicine if nothing's wrong. As Eddie takes a handful of pills, the symbiote begs him not to shut it out and that it can be better. He apologizes to it as the pills begin to take effect, staring into his unkempt reflection as it suddenly launches into a furious tirade, threatening to kill him from the inside and eat his brains. Eddie tries to calm it down until its voice goes silent, pondering the symbiote's latest backslide into murderous rage and bloodlust - which at its worst is so intense that it frightens him. A police scanner interrupts his brooding, declaring that the Jack O'Lantern has been sighted. Transforming into Venom, Eddie notes that he lost his job at the Fact Sheet due to being unable to concentrate on writing with the symbiote screaming psychotic nonsense into his brain and trying to force him to kill everyone around him. While he can barely control the symbiote enough to get from Point A to Point B by web-swinging, he's affirms to himself that he's not completely useless despite being sidelined.\n\nIn a warehouse, [[Jack O'Lantern (Impostor II) (Earth-616)|Jack O'Lantern]] attempts to carry out an arms deal, unloading high-tech guns that he claims came from [[Norman Osborn (Earth-616)|Norman Osborn]]'s private stash and don't trigger [[Peter Parker (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]'s Spider-Sense. His buyers - the [[Maxwell Markham (Earth-616)|Grizzly]], [[Brian Hibbs (Earth-616)|Kangaroo]], and [[Hippo (Earth-616)|Hippo]] - are skeptical and dismiss him as an idiot; but before Jack can respond, the lights go out and they are surrounded by police. Taking pictures from a nearby rooftop, Eddie laments that the symbiote's renewed bloodlust makes him unwilling to engage in combat lest it go berserk. Despite feeling like a coward and telling himself he would've intervened had something gone wrong, he's relieved that the situation is under control. As soon as he thinks that, Jack O'Lantern pulls out a pistol and shoots one of the cops, fleeing into an alley. The Venom symbiote takes over, reducing Eddie to a passenger in his own body. He pleads with the symbiote to stop, but it only responds with maniacal laughter and bloodthirsty screaming as Venom pounces on Jack, shattering his pumpkin helmet. The man - who is not [[Jack O'Lantern (Crime-Master's) (Earth-616)|the real Jack O'Lantern]] - recognizes Venom and surrenders, begging for mercy and saying he just found and stole Jack's costume and gear.\n\nAs Venom towers over the man, silhouetted by lightning, Eddie laments that this isn't him and that the symbiote isn't listening. As the man continues to beg for mercy, Venom stabs a clawed thumb into his right eye, the police arriving seconds later and telling Venom to freeze. As they open fire ineffectually, Venom turns around to reveal his eyespots have become a crimson spiral, porous holes appearing on his body, his spider-emblem turning into a red dragon, and protruding red veins forming all over his arms and legs. The symbiote speaks in the same alien language the monster in Eddie's nightmare had used and, as it moves to attack, Eddie feels his mind once again drowning in the dark ocean of its bloodlust. As the symbiote continues to speak in the alien language - saying that its god, [[Knull (Earth-616)|Knull]], is awake and coming - Eddie inwardly reels in pain - the words cutting into his mind like broken glass. As Eddie begs for someone to kill him before the symbiote hurts anyone, an explosive bullet hits Venom in the face and detonates. As the smoke clears, Eddie calls out and asks if the officers are alright. The shooter, mistaking him for [[Eugene Thompson (Earth-616)|Flash Thompson]], says that they'll be blind for a few minutes but are otherwise unharmed. Eddie informs the shooter of his mistaken identity, and the shooter remarks that that's disappointing but that he'll have to make do before shooting Eddie in the neck with a tranquillizer dart.\n\nAs Eddie regains consciousness, the symbiote - sanity restored for the moment - urges him to wake up. The symbiote demands that Eddie kill the man who attacked them, forcing his eyes open and sneering that he's worthless and that it should abandon him for a better host. Realizing that the anti-psychotics have worn off, Eddie yells at the symbiote to shut up - noticing that the person who abducted him has chained him to a chair, amps wired to incapacitate the symbiote and a blast furnace to cause it further discomfort and kill them if need be. Seated in a chair nearby, [[Tyrannosaurus (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|a middle-aged African-American man with a scarred face]] chuckles at Eddie's outburst and takes out a lighter, Eddie realizing he knows his way around symbiotes. Eddie demands to know what the man wants with him, and the man replies that he needs Eddie's help - admitting that he wanted Flash Thompson but that his intel on who's bonded to the Venom symbiote must be outdated. The man asks Eddie what he knows about Project Rebirth 2.0, Eddie telling the symbiote to sneak a tendril along the floor and incapacitate him. The symbiote demands they kill him, and when Eddie rebukes it the symbiote apologizes and says it doesn't know what's wrong with it. Speaking out loud, Eddie says that all he knows is that [[Project Rebirth (Earth-616)|Project Rebirth]] was the military program that created [[Steven Rogers (Earth-616)|Captain America]], and that the government had restarted it a few years ago to weaponize his Other, the Venom symbiote. The man chuckles at Eddie's nickname for the symbiote and tells him to go on, Eddie angrily directing the symbiote to attack him while speaking out loud that the government bonded his symbiote to Flash Thompson to create a new supersoldier program.\n\nThe man interrupts Eddie and informs him that Project Rebirth 2.0 was not a \"new\" supersoldier program, but the latest iteration of the [[Sym-Soldier Program (Earth-616)|Sym-Soldier Program]] - holding up an old photograph of himself and several other soldiers bonded to symbiotes. The man mocks Eddie's surprise, telling him he's far from the first human to bond to a symbiote. The man introduces himself as [[Rex Strickland (Earth-616)|Rex Strickland]], stating that he and his comrades were bonded to symbiotes a long time ago, and were recruited by the U.S. government to act as supersoldiers. Stating that before he gets into the details there's a few things Eddie should know about him, he uses his lighter to burn the Venom symbiote's tendril as it moves to grab him and tells Eddie that he's forgotten more about symbiotes than Eddie will ever know. When Eddie expresses disbelief, Rex asks Eddie if he knows what his symbiote's real name is, how old it is, what it likes to eat, what its ideal temperature is, how many hosts it had before it came to Earth, whether it even prefers humans as hosts, and whether he ages while bonded to it - pointing out that he himself is far older than he looks. Rex tells Eddie that he can teach Eddie about his symbiote and help him fix it, asking Eddie if he's had any nightmares lately. Defeated, Eddie asks Rex what he wants, and Rex explains that he left the Sym-Soldier Program a long time ago to become an Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., but that his comrades had permanently bonded to their symbiotes and went insane, being cryogenically frozen afterwards. Now that S.H.I.E.L.D. has fallen, Rex's comrades are being transported to a black box site to be executed, and he wants to rescue them. Eddie asks where Rex and his friends got their symbiotes, and Rex responds by asking if Eddie wants to help him find out.\n\nLater, Eddie walks down an underground tunnel used by S.H.I.E.L.D. to transport black ops mistakes; intending to rescue the men, get the answers he needs from Rex, and kill those responsible for putting the Sym-Soldier Program in motion. As he stands in the middle of the tunnel, a transport truck accompanied by two military support trucks approaches. Eddie notes that Rex informed him that the transport truck is automated, and that the support trucks are the real problem - being piloted by bone-dumb if innocent men. The soldiers within one of the trucks mistake Eddie for a homeless person, sneering that they're like rats and cockroaches, and give the order to run him over. Smirking, Eddie asks the symbiote if it heard that, and it replies that the men in the trucks are evil. Eddie asks the symbiote if it's up to this, worried it will go berserk again, and it replies that it will not fail this time and feels stronger than before. Transforming, Venom rams the transport truck - stopping it in its tracks - and sends its occupants flying. Eddie notes that he and the symbiote are working together as one again and revels in how right this feels. One of the soldiers in the support truck recognizes him, but Venom crushes him using the truck. Eddie wonders why the symbiote went insane in the alleyway before deciding to figure it out later. Venom reaches for the transport truck's back door, but before he can open it the door explodes open. As Venom gets up, he sees the four symbiote supersoldiers standing in the back of the truck, their faces covered with red spirals as they radiate the same darkness that the Venom symbiote had in the alley. One of the symbiote supersoldiers exits the truck and speaks to Venom in the alien language, making the same statement, and the Venom symbiote abruptly separates from Eddie and bows to the symbiote super-soldier, repeating the phrase. As the symbiote supersoldier's arm transforms into a blade, Eddie mentally screams at the Venom symbiote to protect him before lunging at the supersoldier. Eddie is impaled through the chest, shocking the Venom symbiote out of its stupor. It quickly rebonds to and begins healing him, telling him it didn't want to separate from him but that something forced it to. A flash of purple light radiates from the back of the truck, reducing the supersoldiers to silhouettes as they go back into it. The symbiotes' hosts, reduced to drained corpses, are expelled from the back of the truck - something inside having torn their symbiotes off. Ignoring the Venom symbiote urging him to lie still and let it heal him, Eddie sits up and tells it he has to know what's going on, asking what the language it spoke in was. The Venom symbiote tells Eddie that it's an ancient symbiote dialect not spoken in a million years, and the phrase roughly translates to \"God is coming.\"\n\nIn the street above, the pavement splits and ruptures as a [[Symbiote Dragons|massive dragon-like creature]] erupts from the ground and soars skyward, silhouetted by the storm's lightning.\n\n| Solicit             = A VENOM NIGHTMARE 1000 YEARS IN THE MAKING!\n\nA NEW SERIES BY DONNY CATES & RYAN STEGMAN!\n\nIn the wake of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s collapse, an ancient and primordial evil has been awakened beneath the streets of New York, and with it, something equally evil has awakened in that most Wicked of Webslingers \u2013 VENOM!

A voice calls out to him, and as he looks up he sees [[Mary Brock (Earth-616)|Mary Brock]] sitting beside him, which she wasn't a second prior. Standing up, Mary tells him that he can't ignore this forever and offers her hand, saying she knows he's scared but that she's there for him. Taking it, they walk down a corridor towards the cancer ward - Eddie not noticing the monstrous shadow that Mary is casting on the wall. Inside the cancer ward, Eddie sees [[Carl Brock (Earth-616)|his father]] standing over a withered man with fanged teeth and solid black eyes; the walls and floor covered in [[Symbiotes (Race)|living darkness]] oozing from the man's body. Calling himself \"Uncle Dan,\" the withered man assures Eddie he won't hurt him. Eddie suddenly ages to adulthood, asking what's wrong with Dan; and Mary turns to smile maliciously at him, her eyes turning solid black as she says that he's infected with the Abyss. Eddie protests that this isn't how he remembers things happening; Carl assuring his son that everything will be alright, that they're family, and that he will look after Eddie. As the world spider-webs with cracks, Eddie recoils in shock and demands to know where he is.\n\nIn reality, [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|the Maker]] probes at the living darkness cocooning Eddie's body, muttering to himself. Standing in the doorway, [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan Brock]] asks if his half-brother is alright. The Maker tells Dylan that Eddie is decidedly not OK, as he has cancer... frowning and uncertainly muttering \"... I think.\" to himself. When Dylan expresses confusion, the Maker states that given Eddie's medical history even a baby could diagnose his cancer's resurgance, but the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]] is repelling his efforts to assess Eddie's condition - coiling tendrils around his equipment and crushing it. The Maker tells Dylan to get out, as he intends to remove the Venom symbiote from Eddie and the shock and withdrawal could potentially kill him. Musing at the irony of killing Eddie to find out what's killing him, the Maker dons a pair of high-tech gauntlets wreathed in green energy and smiles sadistically as he quips that that's the burden of science. Horrified, Dylan runs out into the hallway calling for help, witnessing Carl Brock being hauled away by a pair of [[Interdimensional Council of Reeds (Multiverse)|Project Oversight]] agents. Carl demands that Dylan come with him, but instead he runs in the opposite direction.\n\nAs darkness swirls around him, Eddie suddenly finds himself in [[Our Lady of Saints Church]], wondering where he is now. Mary suddenly appears, casting a shadow with a fanged maw as she asks how he could've possibly forgotten the place where he was born; jagged white eyespots appearing in the shadows as Eddie looks down to see a gun in his hand. He rebukes her statement, saying he came to the church to commit suicide. The church continues to distort, the stained glass windows depicting Venom in place of the saints -- holding a Knull-controlled symbiote in his hands. Her eyes turning black, Mary asks Eddie why he wanted to kill himself; and as he stares at his reflection in the gun's barrel Eddie says that he'd lost everything and was already dying of cancer. Mary asks Eddie why he came to the church, and Eddie says it was to say goodbye to God. As Knull's crimson spiral forms in the darkness behind her, Mary asks what happened at the church and why Eddie didn't die. Glaring up at her, Eddie says she knows what happened. As red eyespots appear in the darkness behind her, Mary says that she does -- her mouth transforming into a fanged maw. The darkness engulfs Eddie and transforms him into Venom as \"Mary\" tells him to embrace the abyss and let it heal him, telling him that she will protect him and that he will never be alone. The darkness suddenly explodes off Eddie's body and he screams in pain, \"Mary\" reduced to an amorphous mass as she realizes that the Maker is interfering.\n\nIn the real world, the Maker blasts Eddie and the symbiote with green energy, smiling sadistically as both scream in pain and telling the symbiote that the pain will stop when it separates from Eddie. In his mindscape, Eddie has the sudden realization that Mary never existed, and demands to know why \"Mary\" would mess with his memories. Reforming, \"Mary\" tells Eddie to calm down and that he's very sick, saying that his cancer has returned. Eddie rebukes \"Mary\" for lying to him, saying that she showed him his uncle dying of cancer -- the hospital room reappearing, with Knull-controlled symbiotes leering down at them from the windows -- but that he now remembers that he never had an uncle in the first place. Eddie's angry gesture shatters the scene and unmasks \"Mary\" as the Venom symbiote, Eddie mournfully asking why it's done this to him when he thought they'd grown past its corruption and that it loved him. Reaching out to him with a tendril, the Venom symbiote says that it manipulated his memories in order to make him want to stay with it. Eddie recoils in horror and growing rage as he realizes that he'd never had cancer in the first place; accusing the symbiote of modifying his memories and altering his body chemistry to register false positives on medical tests, all in order to make him afraid to separate from it when its bloodlust became too much for him to stomach. The symbiote protests that it was weak and terrified of being alone after Spider-Man's rejection. Eddie states that he understands that might've been the case during their initial tenure as Venom, but demands to know why it would do this to him after their reunion. Rather than answer, the symbiote tells him that it found evidence that [[Cletus Kasady (Earth-616)|Carnage]] is back and [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|more powerful than ever]], and that they have to be together to stand a chance of taking him on. Ignoring its attempt to change the subject, Eddie demands to know why it would go so far as to excise chunks of his memories and pretend to be braindead; the symbiote admitting that it is afraid he is going to separate from it again. Eddie angrily asks why it would think that, and the symbiote retorts that learning Dylan Brock's true identity would cause Eddie to reject it.\n\nEddie regains consciousness, trapped in a bubble of green energy. He demands the Maker let him go, but the evil Reed Richards retorts that there's still a number of tests he wants to run and that he wants to separate him from the symbiote. Eddie demands to know where Dylan is, the Maker saying that the authorities contacted his father to pick him up. Horrified, Eddie tells the Maker that he has to get to Dylan first, the Maker saying that if he disables the containment field the symbiote will rebond to him, but if he removes the symbiote now, Eddie will likely die. Telling the Maker to do what he has to quickly, Eddie states that Dylan is in mortal danger. The Maker expresses confusion, remarking that he's sure Eddie's little brother will be fine, but Eddie states that Dylan isn't his brother - he's his son.\n\nElsewhere in the hospital, an enraged Carl Brock corners Dylan in a janitorial closet, towering over his terrified grandson.\n\n| Solicit             = \u2022 The sinister symbiote skulks the streets of San Francisco!\n\n\u2022 With the symbiote silenced and Eddie finding parts of his memory missing, will he be able to find the answers he\u2019s looking for in the Golden City?\n\n\u2022 Or will the return to his old stomping grounds reveal secrets better left buried?\n\n| Notes               = * Donny Cates clarified on Twitter that Eddie ''did'' have terminal cancer prior to becoming [[Anti-Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Anti-Venom]], though this was a result of the Venom symbiote altering his body chemistry as part of its gambit to convince him he already had the disease.\n| Trivia              = * This issue's [[:File:Venom Vol 4 11 Gibbons Variant.jpg|variant cover]] by [[Dave Gibbons]] is a homage to the artist's own cover from [[w:c:dc:Watchmen Vol 1 1|''Watchmen'' #1]], and a reference to a running joke on Twitter started by [[Venom Vol 4|''Venom'']] penciler [[Ryan Stegman]] that ''Venom'' was better than the critically-acclaimed ''Watchmen''.{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/dave-gibbons-venom-watchmen-variant-cover/|title=Dave Gibbons Gives Venom a Watchmen-Themed Variant|work=CBR.com|first=Tom|last=Chapman|date=6 November 2018|accessdate=15 April 2019}}}}{{r|{{cite web|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/06/11/venom-better-watchmen/|title=Is Venom Better Than Watchmen?|work=Bleeding Cool|first=Rich|last=Johnston|date=11 June 2018|accessdate=15 April 2019}}}}\n| Recommended         = \n| Links               = \n}}\n[[Category:Digital Comic Code included]]"}}}]}, "1233295": {"pageid": 1233295, "ns": 0, "title": "Venom Vol 4 12", "revisions": [{"slots": {"main": {"contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki", "*": "{{Marvel Database:Comic Template\n| Image1              = Venom Vol 4 12.jpg\n| Image2              = Venom Vol 4 12 Textless.jpg\n| Image2_Text         = Textless\n| Image3              = Venom Vol 4 12 Second Printing Variant.jpg\n| Image3_Text         = Second Printing Variant\n| Image4              = Venom Vol 4 12 Spider-Man Villains Variant.jpg\n| Image4_Text         = Spider-Man Villains Variant\n| Image5              = Venom Vol 4 12 The Comic Mint Exclusive Variant.jpg\n| Image5_Text         = The Comic Mint Exclusive Variant\n| Image6              = Venom Vol 4 12 The Comic Mint Exclusive Virgin Variant.jpg \n| Image6_Text         = The Comic Mint Exclusive Virgin Variant\n| Image7              = Venom Vol 4 12 Unknown Comic Books Exclusive Variant.png\n| Image7_Text         = Unknown Comic Books C2E2 Exclusive Variant\n| Image8              = Venom Vol 4 12 Unknown Comic Books Exclusive Virgin Variant.png\n| Image8_Text         = Unknown Comic Books Exclusive Virgin Variant\n\n| Month               = 5\n| Year                = 2019\n| ReleaseDate         = 3-20-2019\n| StoryArc1           = Abyss (Story Arc)\n| Pages               = 32\n| Rating              = T+\n| OriginalPrice       = $3.99\n| NextIssue           = {{cl|Venom Annual Vol 1 1}}<br>(Story)<br>{{cl|Venom Vol 4 13}}<br>(Title)\n\n| Editor-in-Chief     = C.B.

When a confused and concerned Carl asks what happened, she explains that Eddie had transferred the [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom symbiote]] to her in order to save her life -- transforming her into the monstrous [[She-Venom]] -- and for a moment they were simultaneously bonded to it, connected mentally and physically to each other.{{r|Venom: Sinner Takes All Vol 1 2}} After the symbiote returned to Eddie, Anne found she was suddenly and mysteriously pregnant, and gave birth to the boy in her arms, whom she named [[Dylan Brock (Earth-616)|Dylan]]. Telling Carl she can't properly care for her son -- having been traumatized by the experience -- she begs him to look after Dylan. When Carl protests, Anne says they both know that Eddie is [[Venom|a monster]] and can never know he has a son, and that Carl is the only family she has left at this point. Carl takes the baby, and Anne runs off into the rain promising she'll return for Dylan once she's recovered from her psychological trauma, though she never does and ultimately takes her own life.{{r|Amazing Spider-Man Vol 2 19}}\n\nIn the present, [[Reed Richards (Earth-1610)|the Maker]] expresses concern that Eddie won't survive being forcibly separated from the Venom symbiote. Encased in a web of sonic energy, Eddie tells him to turn it up and mentally berates the symbiote for having manipulated him, given him cancer, and betrayed his trust. The Maker complies and separates the symbiote from Eddie, dodging as the symbiote breaks free of the sonic web and smashes his machine, which promptly explodes.\n\nCrossing the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in his car, Carl Brock scolds Dylan for running away and apologizes for hurting him when he lost his temper, warning his grandson that Eddie isn't a good person. Dylan snaps that at least Eddie recognizes that fact and is honest about it, unlike Carl, who is enraged by that insult and moves to slap Dylan for his insolence. The car jolts suddenly, slamming Carl's face into the steering wheel, and he looks into the rear view mirror to see that Venom -- seemingly recovered and restored -- has grabbed onto the back end of the car and is lifting it off the ground. Carl exits the vehicle and confronts Venom, threatening to call the police, but is grabbed by the throat and lifted off the ground. Thinking he's about to be eaten, Carl begs for mercy and promises not to hurt Dylan anymore, but Venom wordlessly glares at him before sticking tendrils into Carl's mouth and eyes, the latter of which turn black with white spirals as the symbiote interfaces with his mind.\n\nCarl finds himself in a police interrogation room, handcuffed to a table, and demands for someone to let him go. \"Eddie Brock\" steps out of the shadows and says no-one's coming, and that it's just them. \"Eddie\" asks Carl if he remembers this room, where he'd once beaten him for wanting to plead guilty for killing an innocent child; though Carl refuses to admit his role in shaping Eddie becoming a monster, saying Eddie's choices were his own. Partially transforming into Venom, \"Eddie\" smashes the table and grabs Carl, slamming him into the wall and snarling that he doesn't get to judge him. His eyes solid black and teeth turned into fangs, \"Eddie\" snarls that he knows he's a monster but that at least he's trying to be a better person, which is why he's talking to Carl instead of eating his brains. Retracting the symbiote, \"Eddie\" states that he knows that Dylan is his son and refuses to let Carl hurt him any longer; though Carl scoffs, saying that it's about time and that Dylan is just like his father. \"Eddie\" protests that Dylan's not a bad person yet, though Carl states that's not what he meant; rather, Dylan is like how Eddie was as a child, finally admitting that Eddie had been a good kid before the accident. Carl asks if Eddie still believes in [[Yahweh (Earth-616)|God]], with \"Eddie\" bitterly retorting that he met [[Knull (Earth-616)|his god]] and hated him. \"Eddie\" tells Carl that he didn't come to make amends or ask for forgiveness, saying that he's taking Dylan and that if Carl tries to stop him or come after them, he's dead. Carl says he understands, so \"Eddie\" -- his eyes black with white spirals for pupils -- breaks their mental connection. Carl regains consciousness on the side of the road in the [[Mojave Desert]], far from San Francisco, and begins limping his way back towards civilization while sobbing apologies.\n\nDylan wakes up to find Venom, sans his trademark mouth full of fangs, carrying him into the hospital, the corridor in ruins and littered with the bodies of [[Interdimensional Council of Reeds (Multiverse)|Project Oversight]] agents. Noting that Venom is unusually silent, Dylan asks what \"Eddie\" is doing as the symbiotic antihero gently sets him down and walks away. When Dylan asks if he is abandoning him, Venom pauses and looks over his shoulder, hesitantly saying that he's trying to be better but that both of them will be better without him. Dylan is confused until he hears a groan coming from the wreckage of the room where the Maker had been operating on Eddie, and enters to see a nearly naked Eddie just regaining consciousness, realizing that it had been the hostless symbiote all along. Eddie groggily asks Dylan what happened, saying that he was going to rescue him before the symbiote escaped, glancing up to where the unconscious Maker is cocooned to the ceiling by black webbing. As they hug, Dylan tells Eddie that the symbiote rescued him before leaving, wondering where it's gone off to.

Eddie tells \"Rex\" to save the psychoanalysis until after the [[Grendel (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Grendel symbiote]] is dead, proceeding to the roof of Rex's warehouse. The Tyrannosaurus symbiote notes it can sense Knull using the Grendel symbiote to search for them, flying around the upper atmosphere; and taps into the Hive Mind to alert Knull to their presence. Eddie is surprised to not feel the rage and bloodlust that had overwhelmed [[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Venom]] previously, and the Tyrannosaurus symbiote notes that it's shielding the Venom symbiote to protect Eddie's mind. The Grendel symbiote dives out of the sky jaws-first and smashes Venom through the roof of the building. As the symbiote-dragon tries to eat Venom, the Tyrannosaurus symbiote pulls out a pair of sonic grenades formerly belonging to the [[Jury (Earth-616)|Jury]] and tosses them down Grendel's throat.\n\nThe Grendel symbiote destabilizes, revealing Knull's manifestation, which points at Venom and says that he has what he was looking for. Venom lunges at Knull in a desperate battle, his weapons proving ineffective against the eldritch god of the abyss. Faced with almost certain death, Eddie realizes he doesn't have a clue what he has to live for, or know if he's even capable of being a good person despite his best efforts. Knull seizes control of the Venom and Tyrannosaurus symbiotes, gloating as he strips them from Eddie and absorbs them. Vowing never to give up, Eddie paraphrases the Tyrannosaurus symbiote's thoughts regarding him and tells Knull he's just donned his own coffin; Knull realizing too late that the symbiotes' arsenal of weapons is set to self-destruct - a blast that affects even Knull's real body at the heart of [[Klyntar (Location)|Klyntar]]. As the Venom symbiote returns to Eddie, Knull - shaken - states no human could ever wound him like that, and asks if Eddie is a god. The Venom symbiote says that the Tyrannosaurus symbiote shielded it from the blast, but that it cannot sense it anymore. Enraged, Knull coats himself in the Grendel symbiote and lunges at Venom, roaring that the symbiote will obey its god.\n\nThe Tyrannosaurus symbiote coils around Knull's manifestation, telling Eddie to open the doors of the blast furnace. Doing so, Eddie notes the blast furnace's temperature feels like touching the sun and that nothing could survive inside; Rex hauling the Grendel symbiote into the inferno. Venom slams the door shut and holds himself against it as Knull's manifestation struggles to break free, the Venom symbiote unable to withstand the heat and separating from him. As his body catches fire, the Venom symbiote tells Eddie he'll die if he keeps this up, Eddie telling the symbiote to go inside him and shut off his pain receptors. The symbiote enters Eddie's body but tells him he's in more pain than it can shut out, Eddie telling it to keep him alive long enough to ensure the Grendel symbiote's death. Knull's arm bursts from the flames, shoving Eddie to the ground... and then crumbles into red ash, the Venom symbiote stating that it can feel his connection to the Grendel symbiote has been severed.\n\nAs Eddie lies on the ground, the Venom symbiote emerges from his body, apologizing and saying that it loves him. As the dying Venom symbiote pools on the ground, Eddie weakly states that he can't hear it and asks where it's gone.\n\n| Solicit             = \u2022 After a brief connection to the GOD-HOST, EDDIE and the VENOM symbiote have emerged with brand new powers!\n\n\u2022 A good thing too, as they\u2019ll need every upgrade they can get as they head down a collision course with the primordial symbiote GRENDEL!\n\n| Notes               = \n| Trivia              = \n| Recommended         = \n| Links               = \n}}\n[[Category:Digital Comic Code included]]"}}}]}, "992": {"pageid": 992, "ns": 118, "title": "Glossary:R", "revisions": [{"slots": {"main": {"contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki", "*": "{| style=\"text-align:center; border: 1px solid #B5B7CF; background-color:#EFF0FF; padding:1em;padding-top:0.5em;width:100%;-moz-border-radius:10px;\" \n|{{GlossaryToC}}\n|}\n__TOC__\n\n{{:Glossary:Radar Sense}}\n{{:Glossary:Realm}}\n{{:Glossary:Reality}}\n{{:Glossary:Reality warper}}\n{{:Glossary:Reboot}}\n{{:Glossary:Recap Page}}\n{{:Glossary:Reincarnation}}\n{{:Glossary:Reflexes}}\n{{:Glossary:Repulsor}}\n{{:Glossary:Retcon}}\n{{:Glossary:Robot}}\n\n{| style=\"text-align:center; border: 1px solid #B5B7CF; background-color:#EFF0FF; padding:1em;padding-top:0.5em;width:100%;-moz-border-radius:10px;\" \n|{{GlossaryToC}}\n|}\n[[Category:Structure]]"}}}]}, "37792": {"pageid": 37792, "ns": 118, "title": "Glossary:Retcon", "revisions": [{"slots": {"main": {"contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki", "*": "{{Marvel Database:Glossary Template\n| Title             = Retcon\n| Image             = \n| Definition        = {{Quote|'''Retroactive continuity.''' It was a phrase mentioned in the letter page of a comic book and it was shortened to retcon. It means you rewrite history to match up with the present.|[[Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)|Spider-Man's Symbiote]]|Symbiote Spider-Man: Alien Reality Vol 1 5}}\n\nA '''retcon''' (short for '''ret'''roactive '''con'''tinuity) is, in a nutshell, a storyteller's tool that adds previously unknown material to an event in a previous story. As with any tool, the quality of the finished product depends on the user's skill and intent. \n\n{{ShowHide\n| title = Further Details\n| body  = <br clear=\"all\">\nA retcon can be a good thing. If your favorite villain seemed to die in his last outing, you might prefer to believe that he didn't really die, so that he can make another appearance. A writer can (and usually does) oblige you by \"resurrecting\" that villain. Suppose that Doctor Doom, when you last saw him, was clinging to an asteroid on its way to the edge of the solar system. You would have to assume that he died, although you wouldn't know it for certain.\n\nNow suppose that, months later, another writer wants to bring Doctor Doom into another story. It would strain your credulity to see him alive with no explanation. Continuity, an element of good storytelling, demands that the writer explain how Doom returned from his trip into space. The writer tells you something you didn't know at the time&mdash;\"''of course'' Doom has a jetpack built into his armor\"&mdash;problem solved. With few exceptions, a writer will leave some ambiguity in these situations, precisely so that later writers can use the character again.\n\nA retcon can also solve problems created by other writers. In a serial medium such as comic books, the creative teams change from time to time, and each team has its own conceptions of the characters. If the previous team made a change that doesn't fit in with the new team's ideas, they can explain it away. In an extreme example of such a retcon, an entire season of the television series ''Dallas'' was undone by retroactively presenting it as a bad dream of one of the characters.\n\nOn the other hand, a retcon can be a bad thing. The only rule in writing is that there are no rules, but there are guidelines.\n\nGuideline #1: play by the rules. All fiction depends on ''suspension of disbelief,'' your willingness to accept a story on its face. It may violate the rules of our world, but you ignore the impracticality ''as long as the story is internally consistent.'' In this type of bad retcon, someone does something out of character, or something happens that directly contradicts what previous writers have accepted as true. In other words, the retcon involves something inconsistent with the accepted \"laws\" of that fictional world.\n\nGuideline #2: use them sparingly. A retcon pulls you out of the story for a moment, forcing you to evaluate it in light of what you already know. If it's plausible and consistent, you'll accept it quickly and go on with the story. Further retcons keep pulling you back out of the story and ruin the experience.\n\nGuideline #3: keep it simple. A retcon adds new material to an old story. If you have read the old story, or first read it at a later time, you will feel cheated because so much was \"left out.\"\n\nGuideline #4: show respect. Some comic-book events have become legends. Changing them retroactively cheapens them.\n\n}}\n\nFor a good example of bad retcons, see the [[Clone Saga]].\n\n| SeeAlso           = \n}}\n[[Category:Venom (Symbiote) (Earth-616)/Quotes]]"}}}]}}}}
